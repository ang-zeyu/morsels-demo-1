Often had I pondered on the odd instructions he had left me governing  the construction of his mighty tomb, and especially those parts which  directed that he be laid in an OPEN casket and that the ponderous  mechanism which controlled the bolts of the vault's huge door be  accessible ONLY FROM THE INSIDE.    Twelve years had passed since I had read the remarkable manuscript of  this remarkable man; this man who remembered no childhood and who could  not even offer a vague guess as to his age; who was always young and  yet who had dandled my grandfather's great-grandfather upon his knee;  this man who had spent ten years upon the planet Mars; who had fought  for the green men of Barsoom and fought against them; who had fought  for and against the red men and who had won the ever beautiful Dejah  Thoris, Princess of Helium, for his wife, and for nearly ten years had  been a prince of the house of Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium.    Twelve years had passed since his body had been found upon the bluff  before his cottage overlooking the Hudson, and oft-times during these  long years I had wondered if John Carter were really dead, or if he  again roamed the dead sea bottoms of that dying planet; if he had  returned to Barsoom to find that he had opened the frowning portals of  the mighty atmosphere plant in time to save the countless millions who  were dying of asphyxiation on that far-gone day that had seen him  hurtled ruthlessly through forty-eight million miles of space back to  Earth once more.  I had wondered if he had found his black-haired  Princess and the slender son he had dreamed was with her in the royal  gardens of Tardos Mors, awaiting his return.    Or, had he found that he had been too late, and thus gone back to a  living death upon a dead world?  Or was he really dead after all, never  to return either to his mother Earth or his beloved Mars?    Thus was I lost in useless speculation one sultry August evening when  old Ben, my body servant, handed me a telegram.  Tearing it open I read:      'Meet me to-morrow hotel Raleigh Richmond.    'JOHN CARTER'      Early the next morning I took the first train for Richmond and within  two hours was being ushered into the room occupied by John Carter.    As I entered he rose to greet me, his old-time cordial smile of welcome  lighting his handsome face.  Apparently he had not aged a minute, but  was still the straight, clean-limbed fighting-man of thirty.  His keen  grey eyes were undimmed, and the only lines upon his face were the  lines of iron character and determination that always had been there  since first I remembered him, nearly thirty-five years before.    'Well, nephew,' he greeted me, 'do you feel as though you were seeing a  ghost, or suffering from the effects of too many of Uncle Ben's juleps?'    'Juleps, I reckon,' I replied, 'for I certainly feel mighty good; but  maybe it's just the sight of you again that affects me.  You have been  back to Mars?  Tell me.  And Dejah Thoris?  You found her well and  awaiting you?'    'Yes, I have been to Barsoom again, and--but it's a long story, too  long to tell in the limited time I have before I must return.  I have  learned the secret, nephew, and I may traverse the trackless void at my  will, coming and going between the countless planets as I list; but my  heart is always in Barsoom, and while it is there in the keeping of my  Martian Princess, I doubt that I shall ever again leave the dying world  that is my life.    'I have come now because my affection for you prompted me to see you  once more before you pass over for ever into that other life that I  shall never know, and which though I have died thrice and shall die  again to-night, as you know death, I am as unable to fathom as are you.    'Even the wise and mysterious therns of Barsoom, that ancient cult  which for countless ages has been credited with holding the secret of  life and death in their impregnable fastnesses upon the hither slopes  of the Mountains of Otz, are as ignorant as we.  I have proved it,  though I near lost my life in the doing of it; but you shall read it  all in the notes I have been making during the last three months that I  have been back upon Earth.'    He patted a swelling portfolio that lay on the table at his elbow.    'I know that you are interested and that you believe, and I know that  the world, too, is interested, though they will not believe for many  years; yes, for many ages, since they cannot understand.  Earth men  have not yet progressed to a point where they can comprehend the things  that I have written in those notes.    'Give them what you wish of it, what you think will not harm them, but  do not feel aggrieved if they laugh at you.'    That night I walked down to the cemetery with him.  At the door of his  vault he turned and pressed my hand.    'Good-bye, nephew,' he said.  'I may never see you again, for I doubt  that I can ever bring myself to leave my wife and boy while they live,  and the span of life upon Barsoom is often more than a thousand years.'    He entered the vault.  The great door swung slowly to.  The ponderous  bolts grated into place.  The lock clicked.  I have never seen Captain  John Carter, of Virginia, since.    But here is the story of his return to Mars on that other occasion, as  I have gleaned it from the great mass of notes which he left for me  upon the table of his room in the hotel at Richmond.    There is much which I have left out; much which I have not dared to  tell; but you will find the story of his second search for Dejah  Thoris, Princess of Helium, even more remarkable than was his first  manuscript which I gave to an unbelieving world a short time since and  through which we followed the fighting Virginian across dead sea  bottoms under the moons of Mars.

Victory and Defeat            CHAPTER I    THE PLANT MEN      As I stood upon the bluff before my cottage on that clear cold night in  the early part of March, 1886, the noble Hudson flowing like the grey  and silent spectre of a dead river below me, I felt again the strange,  compelling influence of the mighty god of war, my beloved Mars, which  for ten long and lonesome years I had implored with outstretched arms  to carry me back to my lost love.    Not since that other March night in 1866, when I had stood without that  Arizona cave in which my still and lifeless body lay wrapped in the  similitude of earthly death had I felt the irresistible attraction of  the god of my profession.    With arms outstretched toward the red eye of the great star I stood  praying for a return of that strange power which twice had drawn me  through the immensity of space, praying as I had prayed on a thousand  nights before during the long ten years that I had waited and hoped.    Suddenly a qualm of nausea swept over me, my senses swam, my knees gave  beneath me and I pitched headlong to the ground upon the very verge of  the dizzy bluff.    Instantly my brain cleared and there swept back across the threshold of  my memory the vivid picture of the horrors of that ghostly Arizona  cave; again, as on that far-gone night, my muscles refused to respond  to my will and again, as though even here upon the banks of the placid  Hudson, I could hear the awful moans and rustling of the fearsome thing  which had lurked and threatened me from the dark recesses of the cave,  I made the same mighty and superhuman effort to break the bonds of the  strange anaesthesia which held me, and again came the sharp click as of  the sudden parting of a taut wire, and I stood naked and free beside  the staring, lifeless thing that had so recently pulsed with the warm,  red life-blood of John Carter.    With scarcely a parting glance I turned my eyes again toward Mars,  lifted my hands toward his lurid rays, and waited.    Nor did I have long to wait; for scarce had I turned ere I shot with  the rapidity of thought into the awful void before me.  There was the  same instant of unthinkable cold and utter darkness that I had  experienced twenty years before, and then I opened my eyes in another  world, beneath the burning rays of a hot sun, which beat through a tiny  opening in the dome of the mighty forest in which I lay.    The scene that met my eyes was so un-Martian that my heart sprang to my  throat as the sudden fear swept through me that I had been aimlessly  tossed upon some strange planet by a cruel fate.    Why not?  What guide had I through the trackless waste of  interplanetary space?  What assurance that I might not as well be  hurtled to some far-distant star of another solar system, as to Mars?    I lay upon a close-cropped sward of red grasslike vegetation, and about  me stretched a grove of strange and beautiful trees, covered with huge  and gorgeous blossoms and filled with brilliant, voiceless birds.  I  call them birds since they were winged, but mortal eye ne'er rested on  such odd, unearthly shapes.    The vegetation was similar to that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#1)"],[1,"SINGLETON      By Daniel Defoe        With An Introduction By Edward Garnett          [Transcriber's Note: In the print copy, the following words and those of  the title page are written in intricate, illuminated calligraphy.]    A TALE WHICH HOLDETH CHILDREN FROM PLAY AND OLD MEN FROM THE CHIMNEY  CORNER    SIR PHILIP SIDNEY          THE LIFE ADVENTURES AND PIRACIES OF THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN SINGLETON          PREFACE    That all Defoe's novels, with the exception of \"Robinson Crusoe,\" should  have been covered with the dust of neglect for many generations, is a  plain proof of how much fashions in taste affect the popularity of the  British classics. It is true that three generations or so ago, Defoe's  works were edited by both Sir Walter Scott and Hazlitt, and that this  masterly piece of realism, \"Captain Singleton,\" was reprinted a few  years back in \"The Camelot Classics,\" but it is safe to say that out of  every thousand readers of \"Robinson Crusoe\" only one or two will  have even heard of the \"Memoirs of a Cavalier,\" \"Colonel Jack,\" \"Moll  Flanders,\" or \"Captain Singleton.\" It is indeed distressing to think  that while many scores of thousands of copies of Lord Lytton's flashy  romance, \"Paul Clifford,\" have been devoured by the public, \"Captain  Singleton\" has remained unread and almost forgotten. But the explanation  is simple. Defoe's plain and homely realism soon grew to be thought  vulgar by people who themselves aspired to be refined and genteel. The  rapid spread of popular education, in the middle of last century, was  responsible for a great many aberrations of taste, and the works of the  two most English of Englishmen, Defoe and Hogarth, were judged to be  hardly fitting for polite society, as we may see from Lamb's Essay on  Hogarth, and from an early edition of Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia of English  Literature\" (1843), where we are told: \"Nor is it needful to show how  elegant and reflective literature, especially, tends to moralise, to  soften, and to adorn the soul and life of man.\" \"Unfortunately the  taste or _circumstances of Defoe led him mostly into low life_, and his  characters are such _as we cannot sympathise with_. The whole arcana  of roguery and villany seems to have been open to him.... It might be  thought that the good taste which led Defoe to write in a style of such  pure and unpretending English, instead of the inflated manner of vulgar  writers, _would have dictated a more careful selection of his subjects_,  and kept him from wandering so frequently into the low and disgusting  purlieus of vice. But this moral and tasteful discrimination seems to  have been wholly wanting,\" &c. The 'forties were the days when critics  still talked learnedly of the \"noble style,\" &c., \"the vulgar,\" of  \"sinking\" or \"rising\" with \"the subject,\" the days when Books of Beauty  were in fashion, and Rembrandt's choice of beggars, wrinkled faces and  grey hairs, for his favourite subjects seemed a low and reprehensible  taste in \"high art.\" Though critics to-day still ingenuously confound an  artist's subject with his treatment of it, and prefer scenes of life to  be idealised rather than realised by writers, we have advanced a little  since the days of the poet Montgomery, and it would be difficult now  to find anybody writing so confidently--\"Unfortunately the taste or  circumstances of Defoe led him mostly into low life,\" however much the  critic might believe it. But let us glance at a few passages in \"Captain  Singleton,\" which may show us why Defoe excels as a realist, and why  his descriptions of \"low life\" are artistically as perfect as any  descriptions of \"higher life\" in the works of the English novelists.  Take the following description of kidnapping:--      \"The woman pretending to take me up in her arms and kiss me, and    play with me, draws the girl a good way from the house, till at    last she makes a fine story to the girl, and bids her go back to    the maid, and tell her where she was with the child; that a    gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child and was kissing it, but    she should not be frightened, or to that purpose; for they were    but just there; and so while the girl went, she carried me quite    away.--Page 2.    Now here, in a single sentence, Defoe catches for us the whole soul  and character of the situation. It _seems_ very simple, but it sums up  marvellously an exact observation and knowledge of the arts of the gipsy  child-stealer, of her cunning flattery and brassy boldness, and we can  see the simple little girl running back to the house to tell the nurse  that a fine lady was kissing the child, and had told her to tell where  they were and she should not be frightened, &c.; and this picture again  calls up the hue and cry after the kidnappers and the fruitless hopes of  the parents. In a word, Defoe has condensed in the eight simple lines of  his little scene all that is essential to its living truth; and let the  young writer note that it is ever the sign of the master to do in three  words, or with three strokes, what the ordinary artist does in thirty.  Defoe's imagination is so extraordinarily comprehensive in picking out  just those little matter-of-fact details that suggest all the other  aspects, and that emphasise the character of the scene or situation,  that he makes us believe in the actuality of whatever he is describing.  So real, so living in every detail is this apocryphal narrative, in  \"Captain Singleton,\" of the crossing of Africa by a body of marooned  sailors from the coast of Mozambique to the Gold Coast, that one would  firmly believe Defoe was committing to writing the verbal narrative of  some adventurer in the flesh, if it were not for certain passages--such  as the description of the impossible desert on page 90, which proves  that Defoe was piecing together his description of an imaginary  journey from the geographical records and travellers' tales of his  contemporaries, aided perhaps by the confused yarns of some sailor  friends. How substantially truthful in spirit and in detail is Defoe's  account of Madagascar is proved by the narrative of Robert Drury's  \"Captivity in Madagascar,\" published in 1729. The natives themselves,  as described intimately by Drury, who lived amongst them for many years,  would produce just such an effect as Defoe describes on rough sailors in  their perilous position. The method by which Defoe compels us to accept  improbabilities, and lulls our critical sense asleep, is well shown in  the following passages:--      \"Thieving, lying, swearing, forswearing, joined to the most    abominable lewdness, was the stated practice of the ship's crew;    adding to it, that with the most unsufferable boasts of their own    courage, they were, generally speaking, the most complete cowards    that I ever met with.\"--Page 7.      \"All the seamen in a body came up to the rail of the quarter-deck,    where the captain was walking with some of his officers, and    appointing the boatswain to speak for them, he went up, and falling    on his knees to the captain, begged of him in the humblest manner    possible, to receive the four men on board again, offering to answer    for their fidelity, or to have them kept in chains, till they came    to Lisbon, and there to be delivered up to justice, rather than, as    they said, to have them left, to be murdered by savages, or devoured    by wild beasts. It was a great while ere the captain took any notice    of them, but when he did, he ordered the boatswain to be seized, and    threatened to bring him to the capstan for speaking for them....    Upon this severity, one of the seamen, bolder than the rest, but    still with all possible respect to the captain, besought his honour,    as he called him, that he would give leave to some more of them to    go on shore, and die with their companions, or, if possible, to    assist them to resist the barbarians.\"--Page 18.    Now the first passage we have quoted about the cowardice, &c., of the  Portuguese crew is not in keeping with the second passage, which shows  the men as \"wishing to die with their companions\"; but so actual is  the scene of the seamen \"in a body coming up to the rail of the  quarter-deck,\" that we cannot but believe the thing happened so, just as  we believe in all the thousand little details of the imaginary narrative  of \"Robinson Crusoe.\" This feat of the imagination Defoe strengthens  in the most artful manner, by putting in the mouths of his characters  various reflections to substantiate the narrative. For example, in the  description, on page 263, of the savages who lined the perilous channel  in a half-moon, where the European ship lay, we find the afterthoughts  are added so naturally, that they would carry conviction to any judge or  jury:--      \"They little thought what service they had done us, and how    unwittingly, and by the greatest ignorance, they had made    themselves pilots to us, while we, having not sounded the place,    might have been lost before we were aware. _It is true we might    have sounded our new harbour, before we had ventured out; but I    cannot say for certain, whether we should or not; for I, for my    part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case was;    however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have    looked about us a little._\"    Turning to the other literary qualities that make Defoe's novels great,  if little read, classics, how delightful are the little satiric touches  that add grave weight to the story. Consider the following: \"My good  gipsy mother, for some of her worthy actions, no doubt, happened in  process of time to be hanged, and as this fell out something too soon  for me to be perfected in the strolling trade,\" &c.(p. 3). Every other  word here is dryly satiric, and the large free callousness and careless  brutality of Defoe's days with regard to the life of criminals is  conveyed in half a sentence. And"]]]
