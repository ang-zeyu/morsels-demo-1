THE TORCH-BEARERS      WATCHERS OF THE SKY        BY    ALFRED NOYES          PREFATORY NOTE    This volume, while it is complete in itself, is also the first of a  trilogy, the scope of which is suggested in the prologue. The story of  scientific discovery has its own epic unity--a unity of purpose and  endeavour--the single torch passing from hand to hand through the  centuries; and the great moments of science when, after long labour,  the pioneers saw their accumulated facts falling into a significant  order--sometimes in the form of a law that revolutionised the whole  world of thought--have an intense human interest, and belong  essentially to the creative imagination of poetry. It is with these  moments that my poem is chiefly concerned, not with any impossible  attempt to cover the whole field or to make a new poetic system, after  the Lucretian model, out of modern science.    The theme has been in my mind for a good many years; and the first  volume, dealing with the \"Watchers of the Sky,\" began to take definite  shape during what was to me an unforgettable experience--the night I  was privileged to spend on a summit of the Sierra Madre Mountains,  when the first trial was made of the new 100-inch telescope. The  prologue to this volume attempts to give a picture of that night, and  to elucidate my own purpose.    The first tale in this volume plunges into the middle of things, with  the revolution brought about by Copernicus; but, within the tale,  partly by means of an incidental lyric, there is an attempt to give a  bird's-eye view of what had gone before. The torch then passes to  Tycho Brahe, who, driven into exile with his tables of the stars, at  the very point of death hands them over to a young man named Kepler.  Kepler, with their help, arrives at his own great laws, and  corresponds with Galileo--the intensely human drama of whose life I  have endeavoured to depict with more historical accuracy than can be  attributed to much of the poetic literature that has gathered around  his name. Too many writers have succumbed to the temptation of the  cry, \"e pur si muove!\" It is, of course, rejected by every reliable  historian, and was first attributed to Galileo a hundred years after  his death. M. Ponsard, in his play on the subject, succumbed to the  extent of making his final scene end with Galileo \"frappant du pied la  terre,\" and crying, \"pourtant elle tourne.\" Galileo's recantation was  a far more subtle and tragically complicated affair than that. Even  Landor succumbed to the easy method of making him display his entirely  legendary scars to Milton. If these familiar pictures are not to be  found in my poem, it may be well for me to assure the hasty reader  that it is because I have endeavoured to present a more just picture.  I have tried to suggest the complications of motive in this section by  a series of letters passing between the characters chiefly concerned.  There was, of course, a certain poetic significance in the legend of  \"e pur si muove\"; and this significance I have endeavoured to retain  without violating historical truth.    In the year of Galileo's death Newton was born, and the subsequent  sections carry the story on to the modern observatory again. The form  I have adopted is a development from that of an earlier book,  \"_Tales of the Mermaid Tavern_\" where certain poets and  discoverers of another kind were brought together round a central  idea, and their stories told in a combination of narrative and lyrical  verse. \"The Torch-Bearers\" flowed all the more naturally into a  similar form in view of the fact that Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and many  other pioneers of science wrote a considerable number of poems.  Those imbedded in the works of Kepler--whose blazing and fantastic  genius was, indeed, primarily poetic--are of extraordinary interest. I  was helped, too, in the general scheme by those constant meetings  between science and poetry, of which the most famous and beautiful are  the visit of Sir Henry Wotton to Kepler, and the visit of Milton to  Galileo in prison.    Even if science and poetry were as deadly opposites as the shallow  often affirm, the method and scheme indicated above would at least  make it possible to convey something of the splendour of the long  battle for the light in its most human aspect. Poetry has its own  precision of expression and, in modern times, it has been seeking more  and more for truth, sometimes even at the expense of beauty. It may be  possible to carry that quest a stage farther, to the point where, in  the great rhythmical laws of the universe revealed by science, truth  and beauty are reunited. If poetry can do this, it will not be without  some value to science itself, and it will be playing its part in the  reconstruction of a shattered world.  The passing of the old order of  dogmatic religion has left the modern world in a strange chaos,  craving for something in which it can unfeignedly believe, and often  following will-o'-the-wisps. Forty years ago, Matthew Arnold  prophesied that it would be for poetry, \"where it is worthy of its  high destinies,\" to help to carry on the purer fire, and to express in  new terms those eternal ideas which must ever be the only sure stay of  the human race. It is not within the province of science to attempt a  post-Copernican justification of the ways of God to man; but, in the  laws of nature revealed by science, and in \"that grand sequence of  events which\"--as Darwin affirmed--\"the mind refuses to accept as the  result of blind chance,\" poetry may discover its own new grounds for  the attempt. It is easy to assume that all hope and faith are shallow.  It is even easier to practise a really shallow and devitalising  pessimism. The modern annunciation that there is a skeleton an inch  beneath the skin of man is neither new nor profound. Neither science  nor poetry can rest there; and if, in this poem, an attempt is made to  show that spiritual values are not diminished or overwhelmed by the  \"fifteen hundred universes\" that passed in review before the telescope  of Herschel, it is only after the opposite argument--so common and so  easy to-day--has been faced; and only after poetry has at least  endeavoured to follow the torch of science to its own deep-set  boundary-mark in that immense darkness of Space and Time.

By night it joined the company of heaven,  And, with its constant light, became a star.  A needle-point of light, minute, remote,  It sent a subtler message through the abyss,  Held more significance for the seeing eye  Than all the darkness that would blot it out,  Yet could not dwarf it.                          High in heaven it shone,  Alive with all the thoughts, and hopes, and dreams  Of man's adventurous mind.                             Up there, I knew  The explorers of the sky, the pioneers  Of science, now made ready to attack  That darkness once again, and win new worlds.  To-morrow night they hoped to crown the toil  Of twenty years, and turn upon the sky  The noblest weapon ever made by man.  War had delayed them. They had been drawn away  Designing darker weapons. But no gun  Could outrange this.    \"To-morrow night\"--so wrote their chief--\"we try  Our great new telescope, the hundred-inch.  Your Milton's 'optic tube' has grown in power  Since Galileo, famous, blind, and old,  Talked with him, in that prison, of the sky.  We creep to power by inches. Europe trusts  Her 'giant forty' still. Even to-night  Our own old sixty has its work to do;  And now our hundred-inch . . . I hardly dare  To think what this new muzzle of ours may find.  Come up, and spend that night among the stars  Here, on our mountain-top. If all goes well,  Then, at the least, my friend, you'll see a moon  Stranger, but nearer, many a thousand mile  Than earth has ever seen her, even in dreams.  As for the stars, if seeing them were all,  Three thousand million new-found points of light  Is our rough guess. But never speak of this.  You know our press. They'd miss the one result  To flash 'three thousand millions' round the world.\"  To-morrow night! For more than twenty years,  They had thought and planned and worked. Ten years had gone,  One-fourth, or more, of man's brief working life,  Before they made those solid tons of glass,  Their hundred-inch reflector, the clear pool,  The polished flawless pool that it must be  To hold the perfect image of a star.  And, even now, some secret flaw--none knew  Until to-morrow's test--might waste it all.  Where was the gambler that would stake so much,--  Time, patience, treasure, on a single throw?  The cost of it,--they'd not find that again,  Either in gold or life-stuff! All their youth  Was fuel to the flame of this one work.  Once in a lifetime to the man of science,  Despite what fools believe his ice-cooled blood,  There comes this drama.                          If he fails, he fails  Utterly. He at least will have no time  For fresh beginnings. Other men, no doubt,  Years hence, will use the footholes that he cut  In those precipitous cliffs, and reach the height,  But he will never see it.\"                              So for me,  The light words of that letter seemed to hide  The passion of a lifetime, and I shared  The crowning moment of its hope and fear.

The great man's licensed friend!--if friend, not  slave, is to be the word. Believe me, Timocles, amid the humiliation and  drudgery of his lot, I know not where to turn for a beginning. Many, if  not most, of his hardships are familiar to me; not, heaven knows, from  personal experience, for I have never been reduced to such extremity, and  pray that I never may be; but from the lips of numerous victims; from the  bitter outcries of those who were yet in the snare, and the complacent  recollections of others who, like escaped prisoners, found a pleasure in  detailing all that they had been through. The evidence of the latter was  particularly valuable. Mystics, as it were, of the highest grade,  Dependency had no secrets for them. Accordingly, it was with keen  interest that I listened to their stories of miraculous deliverance from  moral shipwreck. They reminded me of the mariners who, duly cropped,  gather at the doors of a temple, with their tale of stormy seas and  monster waves and promontories, castings out of cargoes, snappings of  masts, shatterings of rudders; ending with the appearance of those twin  brethren [Footnote: The Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, who were supposed to  appear to sailors in distress.] so indispensable to nautical story, or of  some other _deus ex machina_, who, seated at the masthead or  standing at the helm, guides the vessel to some sandy shore, there to  break up at her leisure--not before her crew (so benevolent is the God!)  have effected a safe landing. The mariner, however, is liberal in  embellishment, being prompted thereto by the exigencies of his situation;  for by his appearance as a favourite of heaven, not merely a victim of  fortune, the number of the charitable is increased. It is otherwise with  those whose narrative is of domestic storms, of billows rising mountain  high (if so I may phrase it) within four walls. They tell us of the  seductive calm that first lured them on to those waters, of the  sufferings they endured throughout the voyage, the thirst, the  sea-sickness, the briny drenchings; and how at last their luckless craft  went to pieces upon some hidden reef or at the foot of some steep crag,  leaving them to swim for it, and to land naked and utterly destitute. All  this they tell us: but I have ever suspected them of having convenient  lapses of memory, and omitting the worst part for very shame. For myself,  I shall have no such scruple. All that I have heard, or can reasonably  infer, of the evils of dependence, I shall place before you. For either,  friend, my penetration is at fault, or you have long had a hankering for  this profession.    Yes, I have seen it from the first, whenever the conversation has fallen  on this subject of salaried intellects. 'Happy men!' some enthusiast has  cried. 'The _elite_ of Rome are their friends. They dine  sumptuously, and call for no reckoning. They are lodged splendidly, and  travel comfortably--nay, luxuriously--with cushions at their backs, and  as often as not a fine pair of creams in front of them. And, as if this  were not enough, the friendship they enjoy and the handsome treatment  they receive is made good to them with a substantial salary. They sow  not, they plough not; yet all things grow for their use.' How I have seen  you prick up your ears at such words as these! How wide your mouth has  opened to the bait!    Now I will have a clear conscience in this matter. I will not be told  hereafter that I saw you swallowing this palpable bait, and never stirred  a finger to snatch it from you, and show you the hook while there was yet  time; that I watched you nibbling, saw the hook well in and the fish  hauled up, and then stood by shedding useless tears. A grave charge,  indeed, were I to leave it in your power to bring it; such neglect would  admit of no palliation. You shall therefore hear the whole truth. Now, in  leisurely fashion, from without, not hereafter from within, shall you  examine this weel from which no fish escapes. You shall take in hand this  hook of subtle barb. You shall try the prongs of this eel-spear against  your inflated cheek; and if you decide that they are not sharp, that they  would be easily evaded, that a wound from them would be no great matter,  that they are deficient in power and grasp--then write me among those who  have cowardice to thank for their empty bellies; and for yourself, take  heart of grace, and swoop upon your prey, and cormorant-wise, if you  will, swallow all at a gulp.    But however much the present treatise is indebted to you for its  existence, its application is not confined to you who are philosophers,  whose ambition it is to form your conduct upon serious principles; it  extends to the teachers of literature, of rhetoric, of music,--to all, in  short, whose intellectual attainments can command a maintenance and a  wage. And where the life, from beginning to end, is one and the same for  all, the philosopher (I need not say), so far from being a privileged  person, has but the additional ignominy of being levelled with the rest,  and treated by his paymaster with as scant ceremony as the rest. In  conclusion, whatever disclosures I may be led to make, the blame must  fall in the first instance on the aggressors, and in the second instance  on those who suffer the aggression. For me, unless truth and candour be  crimes, I am blameless.    As to the vulgar rabble of trainers and toadies, illiterate, mean-souled  creatures, born to obscurity, should we attempt to dissuade _them_  from such pursuits, our labour would be wasted. Nor can we fairly blame  them, for putting up any affront, rather than part with their employers.  The life suits them; they are in their element. And what other channel is  there, into which their energies could be directed? Take away this, their  sole vocation, and they are idle cumberers of the earth. They have  nothing, then, to complain of; nor are their employers unreasonable in  turning these humble vessels to the use for which they were designed.  They come into a house prepared for such treatment from the first; it is  their profession to endure and suffer wrong.    But the case of educated men, such as I have mentioned above, is another  matter; it calls for our indignation, and for our utmost endeavours to  restore them to liberty. I think it will not be amiss, if I first examine  into the provocations under which they turn to a life of dependence. By  showing how trivial, how inadequate these provocations are, I shall  forestall the main argument used by the defenders of voluntary servitude.  Most of them are content to cloak their desertion under the names of  Poverty and Necessity. It is enough, they think, to plead in extenuation,  that they sought to flee from this greatest of human ills, Poverty.  Theognis comes pat to their purpose. His      Poverty, soul-subduing Poverty,    is in continual requisition, together with other fearful utterances of  our most degenerate poets to the same effect. Now if I could see that  they really found an escape from poverty in the lives they lead, I would  not be too nice on the point of absolute freedom. But when we find them  (to use the expression of a famous orator) 'faring like men that are  sick,' what conclusion is then left to us to draw? What but this, that  here again they have been misled, the very evil which they sold their  liberty to escape remaining as it was? Poverty unending is their lot.  From the bare pittance they receive nothing can be set apart. Suppose it  paid, and paid in full: the whole sum is swallowed up to the last  farthing, before their necessities are supplied. I would advise them to  think upon better expedients; not such as are merely the protectors and  accomplices of Poverty, but such as will make an end of her altogether.  What say you, Theognis? Might this be a case for,      Steep plunge from crags into the teeming deep?    For when a pauper, a needy hireling, persuades himself that by being what  he is he has escaped poverty, one cannot avoid the conclusion that he  labours under some mistake.    Others tell a different tale. For them, mere poverty would have had no  terrors, had they been able, like other men, to earn their bread by their  labours. But, stricken as they were by age or infirmity, they turned to  this as the easiest way of making a living. Now let us consider whether  they are right. This 'easy' way may be found to involve much labour  before it yields any return; more labour perhaps than any other. To find  money ready to one's hand, without toil or trouble on one's own part,  would indeed be a dream of happiness. But the facts are otherwise. The  toils and troubles of their situation are such as no words can adequately  describe. Health, as it"]]]
