WHAT     KATY        DID          AT            SCHOOL.      CHAPTER I.  CONIC SECTION.    It was just after that happy visit of which I told at the end of \"What  Katy Did,\" that Elsie and John made their famous excursion to Conic  Section; an excursion which neither of them ever forgot, and about  which the family teased them for a long time afterward.    The summer had been cool; but, as often happens after cool summers,  the autumn proved unusually hot.  It seemed as if the months had been  playing a game, and had \"changed places\" all round; and as if September  were determined to show that he knew how to make himself just as  disagreeable as August, if only he chose to do so.  All the last half  of Cousin Helen's stay, the weather was excessively sultry.  She felt  it very much, though the children did all they could to make her  comfortable, with shaded rooms, and iced water, and fans.  Every  evening the boys would wheel her sofa out on the porch, in hopes of  coolness; but it was of no use: the evenings were as warm as the days,  and the yellow dust hanging in the air made the sunshine look thick  and hot.  A few bright leaves appeared on the trees, but they were  wrinkled, and of an ugly color.  Clover said she thought they had been  _boiled_ red like lobsters.  Altogether, the month was a trying one,  and the coming of October made little difference: still the dust  continued, and the heat; and the wind, when it blew, had no refreshment  in it, but seemed to have passed over some great furnace which had  burned out of it all life and flavor.    In spite of this, however it was wonderful to see how Katy gained and  improved.  Every day added to her powers.  First she came down to  dinner, then to breakfast.  She sat on the porch in the afternoons;  she poured the tea.  It was like a miracle to the others, in the  beginning, to watch her going about the house;  but they got used  to it surprisingly soon,--one does to pleasant things.  One person,  however, never got used to it, never took it as a matter of course;  and that was Katy herself.  She could not run downstairs, or out into  the garden; she could not open the kitchen door to give an order,  without a sense of gladness and exultation which was beyond words.  The wider and more active life stimulated her in every way.  Her  cheeks grew round and pink, her eyes bright.  Cousin Helen and papa  watched this change with indescribable pleasure; and Mrs. Worrett,  who dropped in to lunch one day, fairly screamed with surprise at  the sight of it.    \"To think of it!\" she cried, \"why, the last time I was here you looked  as if you had took root in that chair of yours for the rest of your  days, and here you are stepping around as lively as I be.  Well, well!  wonders will never cease.  It does my eyes good to see you, Katherine.  I wish your poor aunt were here to-day; that I do.  How pleased she'd  be?\"    It is doubtful whether Aunt Izzie would have been so pleased, for the  lived-in look of the best parlor would have horrified her extremely;  but Katy did not recollect that just then.  She was touched at the  genuine kindness of Mrs. Worrett's voice, and took very willingly  her offered kiss.  Clover brought lemonade and grapes, and they all  devoted themselves to making the poor lady comfortable.  Just before  she went away she said,    \"How is it that I can't never get any of you to come out to the Conic  Section?  I'm sure I've asked you often enough.  There's Elsie, now,  and John, they're just the age to enjoy being in the country.  Why  won't you send 'em out for a week?  Johnnie can feed chickens, and  chase 'em, too, if she likes,\" she added, as Johnnie dashed just then  into view, pursuing one of Phil's bantams round the house.  \"Tell her  so, won't you, Katherine?  There is lots of chickens on the farm.  She  can chase 'em from morning to night, if she's a mind to.\"    Katy thanked her, but she didn't think the children would care to go.  She gave Johnnie the message, and then the whole matter passed out of  her mind.  The family were in low spirits that morning because of  Cousin Helen's having just gone away; and Elsie was lying on the sofa  fanning herself with a great palm-leaf fan.    \"Oh, dear!\" she sighed.  \"Do you suppose it's every going to be cool  again?  It does seem as if I couldn't bear it any longer.\"    \"Aren't you well, darling?\" inquired Katy, anxiously.    \"Oh, yes! well enough,\" replied Elsie.  \"It's only this horrid heat,  and never going away to where it's cooler.  I keep thinking about the  country, and wishing I were there feeling the wind blow.  I wonder  if papa wouldn't let John and me go to Conic Section, and see Mrs.  Worrett.  Do you think he would, if you asked him?\"    \"But,\" said Katy, amazed, \"Conic Section isn't exactly country, you  know.  It is just out of the city,--only six miles from here.  And  Mrs. Worrett's house is close to the road, papa said.  Do you think  you'd like it, dear?  It _can't_ be very much cooler than this.\"    \"Oh, yes! it can,\" rejoined Elsie, in a tone which was a little fretful.  \"It's _always_ cooler on a farm.  There's more room for the wind, and--  oh, every thing's pleasanter!  You can't think how tired I am of this  hot house.  Last night I hardly slept at all; and, when I did, I  dreamed that I was a loaf of brown bread, and Debby was putting me  into the oven to bake.  It was a horrid dream.  I was so glad to wake  up.  Won't you ask papa if we may go, Katy?\"    \"Why, of course I will, if you wish it so much.  Only\"--Katy stopped  and did not finish her sentence.  A vision of fat Mrs. Worrett had  risen before her, and she could not help doubting if Elsie would find  the farm as pleasant as she expected.  But sometimes the truest  kindness is in giving people their own unwise way, and Elsie's eyes  looked so wistful that Katy had no heart to argue or refuse.    Dr. Carr looked doubtful when the plan was proposed to him.    \"It's too hot,\" he said.  \"I don't believe the girls will like it.\"    \"Oh, yes! we will, papa; indeed we will,\" pleaded Elsie and John, who  had lingered near the door to learn the fate of their request.    Dr. Carr smiled at the imploring faces, but he looked a little  quizzical.  \"Very well,\" he said, \"you may go.  Mr. Worrett is coming  into town to-morrow, on some bank business.  I'll send word by him;  and in the afternoon, when it is cooler, Alexander can drive you out.\"    \"Goody!  Goody!\" cried John, jumping up and down, while Elsie put her  arms round papa's neck and gave him a hug.    \"And Thursday I'll send for you,\" he continued.    \"But, papa,\" expostulated Elsie, \"That's only two days.  Mrs. Worrett  said a week.\"    \"Yes, she said a week,\" chimed in John; \"and she's got ever so many  chickens, and I'm to feed 'em, and chase 'em as much as I like.  Only  it's too hot to run much,\" she added reflectively.    \"You won't really send for us on Thursday, will you, papa?\" urged  Elsie, anxiously.  \"I'd like to stay ever and ever so long; but Mrs.  Worrett said a week.\"    \"I shall send on Thursday,\" repeated Dr. Carr, in a decided tone.  Then, seeing that Elsie's lip was trembling, and her eyes were full  of tears, he continued: \"Don't look so woeful, Pussy.  Alexander shall  drive out for you; but if you want to stay longer, you may send him  back with a note to say what day you would like to have him come  again.  Will that do?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" said Elsie, wiping her eyes; \"that will do beautifully,  papa.  Only, it seems such a pity that Alexander should have to go  twice when it's so hot; for we're perfectly sure to want to stay  a week.\"    Papa only laughed, as he kissed her.  All being settled the children  began to get ready.  It was quite an excitement packing the bags, and  deciding what to take and what not to take.  Elsie grew bright and gay  with the bustle.  Just to think of being in the country,--the cool  green country,--made her perfectly happy, she declared.  The truth  was, she was a little feverish and not quite well, and didn't know  exactly how she felt or what she wanted.    The drive out was pleasant, except that Alexander upset John's gravity,  and hurt Elsie's dignity very much, by inquiring, as they left the  gate, \"Do the little misses know where it is that they want to go?\"  Part of the way the road ran through woods.  They were rather boggy  woods; but the dense shade kept off the sun, and there was a spicy  smell of evergreens and sweet fern.  Elsie felt that the good time  had fairly begun and her spirits rose with every turn of the wheels.    By and by they left the woods, and came out again into the sunshine.  The road was dusty, and so were the fields, and the ragged sheaves  of corn-stalks, which dotted them here and there, looked dusty too.  Piles of dusty red apples lay on the grass, under the orchard trees.  Some cows going down a lane toward their milking shed, mooed in a  dispirited and thirsty way, which made the children feel thirsty also.    \"I want a drink of water awfully,\" said John.  \"Do you suppose it's  much farther?  How long will it be before we get to Mrs. Worrett's,  Alexander?\"    \"'Most there, miss,\" replied Alexander, laconically.    Elsie put her head out of the carriage, and looked eagerly round.  Where was the delightful farm?  She saw a big, pumpkin-colored house  by the roadside, a little farther on; but surely that couldn't be  it.  Yes: Alexander drew up at the gate, and jumped down to lift.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that           the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                          The dark star passed, bringing with it                  eternal night and turning history into                  incredible myth in a single generation!      Pa had sent me out to get an extra pail of air. I'd just about scooped  it full and most of the warmth had leaked from my fingers when I saw  the thing.    You know, at first I thought it was a young lady. Yes, a beautiful  young lady's face all glowing in the dark and looking at me from the  fifth floor of the opposite apartment, which hereabouts is the floor  just above the white blanket of frozen air. I'd never seen a live young  lady before, except in the old magazines--Sis is just a kid and Ma is  pretty sick and miserable--and it gave me such a start that I dropped  the pail. Who wouldn't, knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa  and Ma and Sis and you?    Even at that, I don't suppose I should have been surprised. We all  see things now and then. Ma has some pretty bad ones, to judge from  the way she bugs her eyes at nothing and just screams and screams and  huddles back against the blankets hanging around the Nest. Pa says it  is natural we should react like that sometimes.    When I'd recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite  apartment, I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times,  for I saw it wasn't a young lady at all but simply a light--a tiny  light that moved stealthily from window to window, just as if one  of the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to  investigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun, and maybe to hunt  down something to torment or terrify, now that the Earth didn't have  the Sun's protection.    I tell you, the thought of it gave me the creeps. I just stood there  shaking, and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on  the inside that I couldn't have seen the light even if it had come out  of one of the windows to get me. Then I had the wit to go back inside.    Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so  blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of  air from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared. I began to hear the  tick-ticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back  into air, because there's no sound outside in the vacuum, of course.  But my mind was still crawly and uneasy as I pushed through the last  blankets--Pa's got them faced with aluminum foil to hold in the  heat--and came into the Nest.           *       *       *       *       *    Let me tell you about the Nest. It's low and snug, just room for the  four of us and our things. The floor is covered with thick woolly  rugs. Three of the sides are blankets, and the blankets roofing it  touch Pa's head. He tells me it's inside a much bigger room, but I've  never seen the real walls or ceiling.    Against one of the blanket-walls is a big set of shelves, with tools  and books and other stuff, and on top of it a whole row of clocks. Pa's  very fussy about keeping them wound. He says we must never forget time,  and without a sun or moon, that would be easy to do.    The fourth wall has blankets all over except around the fireplace, in  which there is a fire that must never go out. It keeps us from freezing  and does a lot more besides. One of us must always watch it. Some of  the clocks are alarm and we can use them to remind us. In the early  days there was only Ma to take turns with Pa--I think of that when she  gets difficult--but now there's me to help, and Sis too.    It's Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire, though. I always think  of him that way: a tall man sitting cross-legged, frowning anxiously  at the fire, his lined face golden in its light, and every so often  carefully placing on it a piece of coal from the big heap beside it. Pa  tells me there used to be guardians of the fire sometimes in the very  old days--vestal virgins, he calls them--although there was unfrozen  air all around then and you didn't really need one.    He was sitting just that way now, though he got up quick to take the  pail from me and bawl me out for loitering--he'd spotted my frozen  helmet right off. That roused Ma and she joined in picking on me. She's  always trying to get the load off her feelings, Pa explains. He shut  her up pretty fast. Sis let off a couple of silly squeals too.    Pa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth. Now that it was inside  the Nest, you could really feel its coldness. It just seemed to suck  the heat out of everything. Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa  put it down close by the fire.    Yet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive.  It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the  fire. The blankets keep it from escaping too fast. Pa'd like to seal  the whole place, but he can't--building's too earthquake-twisted, and  besides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke.    Pa says air is tiny molecules that fly away like a flash if there isn't  something to stop them. We have to watch sharp not to let the air run  low. Pa always keeps a big reserve supply of it in buckets behind  the first blankets, along with extra coal and cans of food and other  things, such as pails of snow to melt for water. We have to go way down  to the bottom floor for that stuff, which is a mean trip, and get it  through a door to outside.    You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first  and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on  top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white  blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.    Of course, all the parts of the air didn't freeze and snow down at the  same time.    First to drop out was the carbon dioxide--when you're shoveling for  water, you have to make sure you don't go too high and get any of that  stuff mixed in, for it would put you to sleep, maybe for good, and make  the fire go out. Next there's the nitrogen, which doesn't count one way  or the other, though it's the biggest part of the blanket. On top of  that and easy to get at, which is lucky for us, there's the oxygen that  keeps us alive. Pa says we live better than kings ever did, breathing  pure oxygen, but we're used to it and don't notice. Finally, at the  very top, there's a slick of liquid helium, which is funny stuff.  All of these gases in neat separate layers. Like a pussy caffay, Pa  laughingly says, whatever that is.           *       *       *       *       *    I was busting to tell them all about what I'd seen, and so as soon as  I'd ducked out of my helmet and while I was still climbing out of my  suit, I cut loose. Right away Ma got nervous and began making eyes at  the entry-slit in the blankets and wringing her hands together--the  hand where she'd lost three fingers from frostbite inside the good one,  as usual. I could tell that Pa was annoyed at me scaring her and wanted  to explain it all away quickly, yet could see I wasn't fooling.    \"And you watched this light for some time, son?\" he asked when I  finished.    I hadn't said anything about first thinking it was a young lady's face.  Somehow that part embarrassed me.    \"Long enough for it to pass five windows and go to the next floor.\"    \"And it didn't look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or  starlight focused by a growing crystal, or anything like that?\"    He wasn't just making up those ideas. Odd things happen in a world  that's about as cold as can be, and just when you think matter  would be frozen dead, it takes on a strange new life. A slimy stuff  comes crawling toward the Nest, just like an animal snuffing for  heat--that's the liquid helium. And once, when I was little, a bolt of  lightning--not even Pa could figure where it came from--hit the nearby  steeple and crawled up and down it for weeks, until the glow finally  died.    \"Not like anything I ever saw,\" I told him.    He stood for a moment frowning. Then, \"I'll go out with you, and you  show it to me,\" he said.    Ma raised a howl at the idea of being left alone, and Sis joined  in, too, but Pa quieted them. We started climbing into our outside  clothes--mine had been warming by the fire. Pa made them. They have  plastic headpieces that were once big double-duty transparent food  cans, but they keep heat and air in and can replace the air for a  little while, long enough for our trips for water and coal and food and  so on.    Ma started moaning again, \"I've always known there was something  outside there, waiting to get us. I've felt it for years--something  that's part of the cold and hates all warmth and wants to destroy the  Nest. It's been watching us all this time, and now it's coming after  us. It'll get you and then come for me. Don't go, Harry!\"    Pa had everything on but his helmet. He knelt by the fireplace and  reached in and shook the long metal rod that goes up the chimney and  knocks off the ice that keeps trying to clog it. Once a week he goes up  on the roof to check if it's working all right. That's our worst trip  and Pa won't let me make it alone.    \"Sis,\" Pa said quietly, \"come watch the fire. Keep an eye on the air,  too. If it gets low or doesn't seem to be boiling fast enough, fetch  another bucket from behind the blanket. But mind your hands. Use the  cloth to pick up the bucket.\"    Sis quit helping Ma be frightened and came over and did as she was  told. Ma quieted down pretty suddenly, though her eyes were still kind  of wild as she watched Pa fix on his helmet tight and pick up a pail  and the two of us go out.           *       *       "]]]
