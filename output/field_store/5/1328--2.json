APPENDIX    LETTER ON MILITANT HYSTERIA        PREFACE        It has come to be believed that everything that has a bearing upon the  concession of the suffrage to woman has already been brought forward.    In reality, however, the influence of women has caused man to leave  unsaid many things which he ought to have said.    Especially in two respects has woman restricted the discussion.    She has placed her taboo upon all generalisations about women, taking  exception to these on the threefold ground that there would be no  generalisations which would hold true of all women; that  generalisations when reached possess no practical utility; and that  the element of sex does not leave upon women any general imprint such  as could properly be brought up in connexion with the question of  admitting them to the electorate.    Woman has further stifled discussion by placing her taboo upon  anything seriously unflattering being said about her in public.    I would suggest, and would propose here myself to act upon the  suggestion, that, in connexion with the discussion of woman's  suffrage, these restrictions should be laid aside.    In connexion with the setting aside of the restriction upon  generalising, I may perhaps profitably point out that all  generalisations, and not only generalisations which relate to women,  are _ex hypothesi [by hypothesis]_ subject to individual exceptions.  (It is to generalisations that the proverb that \"the exception proves  the rule\" really applies.) I may further point out that practically  every decision which we take in ordinary life, and all legislative  action without exception, is based upon generalisations; and again,  that the question of the suffrage, and with it the larger question as  to the proper sphere of woman, finally turns upon the question as to  what imprint woman's sexual system leaves upon her physical frame,  character, and intellect: in more technical terms, it turns upon the  question as to what are the _secondary sexual character[istic]s_ of  woman.    Now only by a felicitous exercise of the faculty of successful  generalisation can we arrive at a knowledge of these.    With respect to the restriction that nothing which might offend  woman's _amour propre [self love]_ shall be said in public, it may be  pointed out that, while it was perfectly proper and equitable that no  evil (and, as Pericles proposed, also no good) should be said of woman  in public so long as she confined herself to the domestic sphere, the  action of that section of women who have sought to effect an entrance  into public life, has now brought down upon woman, as one of the  penalties, the abrogation of that convention.    A consideration which perhaps ranks only next in importance to that  with which we have been dealing, is that of the logical sanction of  the propositions which are enunciated in the course of such  controversial discussions as that in which we are here involved.    It is clearly a precondition of all useful discussion that the author  and reader should be in accord with respect to the authority of the  generalisations and definitions which supply the premisses for his  reasonings.    Though this might perhaps to the reader appear an impractical ideal, I  would propose here to attempt to reach it by explaining the logical  method which I have set myself to follow.    Although I have from literary necessity employed in my text some of  the verbal forms of dogmatism, I am very far from laying claim to any  dogmatic authority. More than that, I would desire categorically to  repudiate such a claim.    For I do not conceal from myself that, if I took up such a position, I  should wantonly be placing myself at the mercy of my reader. For he  could then, by merely refusing to see in me an authority, bring down  the whole edifice of my argument like a house of cards.    Moreover I am not blind to what would happen if, after I claimed to be  taken as an authority, the reader was indulgent enough still to go on  to read what I have written.    He would in such a case, the moment he encountered a statement with  which he disagreed, simply waive me on one side with the words, \"So  you say.\"    And if he should encounter a statement with which he agreed, he would  in his wisdom, censure me for neglecting to provide for that  proposition a satisfactory logical foundation.    If it is far from my thoughts to claim a right of dictation, it is  equally remote from them to take up the position that I have in my  arguments furnished _proof_ of the thesis which I set out to  establish.    It would be culpable misuse of language to speak in such connexion of  _proof_ or _disproof_.    Proof by testimony, which is available in con-nexion with questions of  fact, is unavailable in connexion with general truths; and logical  proof is obtainable only in that comparatively narrow sphere where  reasoning is based--as in mathematics--upon axioms, or--as in certain  really crucial experiments in the mathematic sciences--upon  quasi-axiomatic premisses.    Everywhere else we base our reasonings on premisses which are simply  more or less probable; and accordingly the conclusions which we arrive  at have in them always an element of insecurity.    It will be clear that in philosophy, in jurisprudence, in political  economy and sociology, and in literary criticism and such like, we are  dealing not with certainties but with propositions which are, for  literary convenience, invested with the garb of certainties.    What kind of logical sanction is it, then, which can attach to  reasonings such as are to be set out here?    They have in point of fact the sanction which attaches to reasonings  based upon premisses arrived at by the method of _diacritical  judgment._    It is, I hasten to notify the reader, not the method, but only the  name here assigned to it, which is unfamiliar. As soon as I exhibit it  in the working, the reader will identify it as that by which every  generalisation and definition ought to be put to the proof.    I may for this purpose take the general statements or definitions  which serve as premisses for my reasonings in the text.    I bring forward those generalisations and definitions because they  commend themselves to my diacritical judgment. In other words, I set  them forth as results which have been reached after reiterated efforts  to call up to mind the totality of my experience, and to de-tect the  factor which is common to all the individual experiences.    When for instance I propose a definition, I have endeavoured to call  to mind all the different uses of the word with which I am  familiar--eliminating, of course, all the obviously incorrect uses.    And when I venture to attempt a generalisation about woman, I  endeavour to recall to mind without distinction all the different  women I have encountered, and to extricate from my impressions what  was common to all,--omitting from consideration (except only when I am  dealing specifically with these) all plainly abnormal women.    Having by this procedure arrived at a generalisation--which may of  course be correct or incorrect--I submit it to my reader, and ask from  him that he should, after going through the same mental operations as  myself, review my judgment, and pronounce his verdict.    If it should then so happen that the reader comes, in the case of any  generalisation, to the same verdict as that which I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#1)"],[1,"RAT RACE                                by JAY FRANKLIN              The Astonishing Narrative of a Man Who Was Somebody         Else ...

Commander  Frank Jacklin returns to consciousness in New York and is shocked to  find himself in the body of Winnie Tompkins, a dissolute stock-broker.  Unable to explain his real identity, Jacklin attempts to fit into  Tompkins' way of life. Complications develop when Jacklin gets  involved with Tompkins' wife, his red-haired mistress and his luscious  secretary. Three too many women for Jacklin to handle.  His foreknowledge of the Alaska sinking and other top secret  matters plunges him into a mad world of intrigue and excitement in  Washington--that place where anything can happen and does! Where is the  real Tompkins is a mystery explained in the smashing climax.    Completely delightful, wholly provocative, the Rat Race is a striking  novel of the American Scene.          CHAPTER 1      When the bomb exploded, U.S.S. Alaska, was steaming westward, under  complete radio silence, somewhere near the international date-line on  the Great Circle course south of the Aleutian Islands.    It was either the second or the third of April, 1945, depending on  whether the Alaska, the latest light carrier to be added to American  naval forces in the Pacific, had passed the 180th meridian.    I was in the carrier, in fact in the magazine, when the blast  occurred and I am the only person who can tell how and why the Alaska  disappeared without a trace in the Arctic waters west of Adak. I  had been assigned by Navy Public Relations to observe and report  on Operation Octopus--the plan to blow up the Jap naval base at  Paramushiro in Kuriles with the Navy's recently developed thorium bomb.    My name, by the way, is Frank Jacklin, Lieutenant-Commander, U.S.N.R.  I had been commissioned shortly after Pearl Harbor, as a result of  my vigorous editorial crusade on the Hartford (Conn.) Courant to  Aid America by Defending the Allies. I was a life-long Republican  and a personal friend of Frank Knox, so I had no trouble with Navy  Intelligence in getting a reserve commission in the summer of 1940.  (I never told them that I had voted for Roosevelt twice, so I was  never subjected to the usual double-check by which the Navy kept its  officer-corps purged of subversive taints and doubtful loyalties.) So  I had a first-rate assignment, by the usual combination of boot-licking  and \"yessing\" which marks a good P.R.O.    It was on the first night in Jap waters, after we had cleared the  radius of the Naval Air Station at Adak, that Professor Chalmis asked  me to accompany him to the magazine. He said that his orders were to  make effective disclosure of the mechanics of the thorium bomb as soon  as we were clear of the Aleutians. Incidentally, he, I and Alaska's  commander, Captain Horatio McAllister, U.S.N., were the only people  aboard who knew the real nature of Operation Octopus. The others had  been alerted, via latrine rumor, that we were engaged in a sneak-raid  on Hokkaido.    The thorium bomb, Chalmis told me, had been developed by the Navy,  parallel to other hitherto unsuccessful experiments conducted by the  Army with uranium. The thorium bomb utilized atomic energy, on a  rather low and inefficient basis by scientific standards, but was yet  sufficiently explosive to destroy a whole city. He proposed to show me  the bomb itself, so that I could describe its physical appearance, and  to brief me on the mechanics of its detonation, leaving to the Navy  scientists at Washington a fuller report on the whole subject of atomic  weapons. He had passes, signed by Captain McAllister, to admit us to  the magazine and proposed, after supper, that we go to examine his  gadget.    It was cold as professional charity on the flight-deck, with sleet  driving in from the northwest as the icy wind from Siberia hit the  moist air of the Japanese Current. There was a nasty cross-sea and the  Alaska was wallowing and pounding as she drove towards Paramushiro at a  steady 30 knots.    \"You know, Jacklin,\" said Chalmis, as the Marine sentry took our passes  and admitted us to the magazine, \"I don't like this kind of thing.\"    \"You mean this war?\" I asked, noticing irrelevantly the way the  electric light gleamed on his bald head.    \"I mean this thorium bomb,\" he replied. \"I had most to do with  developing it and now in a couple of days one of these nice tanned  naval aviators at the mess will take off with it and drop it on  Paramushiro from an altitude of 30,000 feet. The timer is set to work  at an altitude of 500 feet and then two or three thousand human beings  will cease to exist.\"    \"The Japs aren't human,\" I observed, quoting the Navy.    Chalmis looked at me in a strange, staring way.    \"Thank you, Commander,\" he said. \"You have settled my problem. I was  in doubt as to whether to complete this operation in the name of  scientific inquiry, but now I see I have no choice. See this!\" he  continued.    \"This\" was a spherical, finned object of aluminum about the size of a  watermelon, resting on a gleaming chromium-steel cradle.    \"If I take this ring, Jacklin,\" Chalmis remarked, \"and pull it out,  the bomb will explode within five seconds or at 500 feet altitude  whichever takes longer. The five seconds is to give the pilot a margin  of safety in case of accidental release at low altitude. However,  dropping it from 30,000 feet means that the five seconds elapse before  the bomb reaches the level at which it automatically explodes.\"    \"You make me nervous, Professor,\" I objected. \"Can't you explain  without touching it?\"    \"If it exploded now, approximately twenty-four feet below the  water-line,\" Chalmis continued, \"it would create an earthquake wave  which could cause damage at Honolulu and would register on the  seismograph at Fordham University.\"    \"I'll take your word for it,\" I said.    \"So,\" concluded Chalmis, \"if the bomb were to go off now, no one could  know what had happened to the Alaska and the Navy--as I know the  Navy--would decide that thorium bombs were impractical, too dangerous  to use. And so the human race might be spared a few more years of life.\"    \"Stop it!\" I ordered, lunging forward and grabbing for his arm.    But it was too late. Chalmis gave a strong pull on the ring. It came  free and a slight buzzing sound was heard above the whine of the  turbines and the thud of the seas against Alaska's bow.    \"You--\" I began. Then I started counting: \"Three--four--fi--\"....           *       *       *       *       *    There was a hand on my shoulder and a voice that kept saying, \"Snap  out of it!\" I opened bleary eyes to see a familiar figure in uniform  bending over me. My head ached, my mouth tasted dry and metallic, and I  felt strangely heavy around the middle.    \"Hully, Ranty,\" I said. \"Haven't seen you since Kwajalein. What's the  word? What happened to the Alaska?\"    Commander Tolan, U.S.N.R., who had been in my group in Quonset,  straightened up with a laugh. \"When were you ever at Kwajalein,  Winnie?\" he asked. \"And what's the drip about the Alaska?\"    \"You remember,\" I said. \"That time we went into the Marshalls with the  Sara in forty-three. But what happened to my ship? There was a bomb....  Say, where am I and what day is it anyway?\"    There was a burst of laughter from across the room and I turned my  head. I seemed to be sitting in a deep, leather arm-chair in a small,  nicely furnished bar, with sporting-prints on the wall and a group of  three clean-shaven, only slightly paunchy middle-aged men, who looked  like brokers, standing by the rail staring at me. Tolan was the only  man in uniform. These couldn't be doctors and what were civilians doing  in mess....    \"We blew up!\" I insisted. \"Chalmis said....\"    \"You've been dreaming, Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokerish trio. \"You  were making horrible noises in your sleep so Ranty went over and woke  you up.\"    \"If you want to know where you are,\" remarked another, \"you're in the  bar of the Pond Club on West 54th Street, as sure as your name is  Winfred S. Tompkins and this is April 2nd, 1945.\"    \"Winnie Tompkins!\" I exclaimed. \"Why I once knew him quite well. He and  I were at St. Mark's together, then he went to Harvard and Wall Street  while I went to Yale and broke, so we didn't see much of each other  after the depression.\"    \"It's a good gag, Winnie,\" Tolan laughed, \"but now you've had your fun,  how about another drink?\"    I shook my head. \"Listen, Ranty,\" I begged. \"Tell me what happened.  I can take it. Are you dead? Are we all dead? Is this supposed to be  heaven? What's the word?\"    \"That joke's played out,\" said Tolan. \"Here, Tammy, another Scotch and  soda for Mr. Tompkins. A double one.\"    Tompkins! My"]]]
