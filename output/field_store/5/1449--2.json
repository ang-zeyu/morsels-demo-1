INSOMNIA    One afternoon, at low water, Mr. Isbister, a young artist lodging at  Boscastle, walked from that place to the picturesque cove of Pentargen,  desiring to examine the caves there. Halfway down the precipitous  path to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in an  attitude of profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. The  hands of this man hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and  staring before him, and his face was wet with tears.    He glanced round at Isbister's footfall. Both men were disconcerted,  Isbister the more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his  involuntary pause, he remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that  the weather was hot for the time of year.    \"Very,\" answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a second, and added in  a colourless tone, \"I can't sleep.\"    Isbister stopped abruptly. \"No?\" was all he said, but his bearing  conveyed his helpful impulse.    \"It may sound incredible,\" said the stranger, turning weary eyes to  Isbister's face and emphasizing his words with a languid hand, \"but I  have had no sleep--no sleep at all for six nights.\"    \"Had advice?\"    \"Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My nervous system.... They  are all very well for the run of people. It's hard to explain. I dare  not take... sufficiently powerful drugs.\"    \"That makes it difficult,\" said Isbister.    He stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do. Clearly  the man wanted to talk. An idea natural enough under the circumstances,  prompted him to keep the conversation going. \"I've never suffered from  sleeplessness myself,\" he said in a tone of commonplace gossip, \"but in  those cases I have known, people have usually found something--\"    \"I dare make no experiments.\"    He spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space both  men were silent.    \"Exercise?\" suggested Isbister diffidently, with a glance from his  interlocutor's face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore.    \"That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I have followed the coast,  day after day--from New Quay. It has only added muscular fatigue to  the mental. The cause of this unrest was overwork--trouble. There was  something--\"    He stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his forehead with a lean  hand. He resumed speech like one who talks to himself.    \"I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through a world in which  I have no part. I am wifeless--childless--who is it speaks of the  childless as the dead twigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless, I  childless--I could find no duty to do. No desire even in my heart. One  thing at last I set myself to do.    \"I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this  dull body, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I've had enough of drugs!  I don't know if _you_ feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its  exasperating demand of time from the mind--time--life! Live! We only  live in patches. We have to eat, and then comes the dull digestive  complacencies--or irritations. We have to take the air or else our  thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and blind alleys. A  thousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes  drowsiness and sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a man's  day is his own--even at the best! And then come those false friends,  those Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill  rest--black coffee, cocaine--\"    \"I see,\" said Isbister.    \"I did my work,\" said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation.    \"And this is the price?\"    \"Yes.\"    For a little while the two remained without speaking.    \"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel--a hunger and  thirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a  whirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts  leading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady--\"    He paused. \"Towards the gulf.\"    \"You must sleep,\" said Isbister decisively, and with an air of a remedy  discovered. \"Certainly you must sleep.\"    \"My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer. But I know I am  drawing towards the vortex. Presently--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light of the day, out  of this sweet world of sanity--down--\"    \"But,\" expostulated Isbister.    The man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and his  voice suddenly high. \"I shall kill myself. If in no other way--at the  foot of yonder dark precipice there, where the waves are green, and the  white surge lifts and falls, and that little thread of water trembles  down. There at any rate is ... sleep.\"    \"That's unreasonable,\" said Isbister, startled at the man's hysterical  gust of emotion. \"Drugs are better than that.\"    \"There at any rate is sleep,\" repeated the stranger, not heeding him.    Isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex  Providence had indeed brought them together that afternoon. \"It's not  a cert, you know,\" he remarked. \"There's a cliff like that at Lulworth  Cove--as high, anyhow--and a little girl fell from top to bottom. And  lives to-day--sound and well.\"    \"But those rocks there?\"    \"One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night, broken  bones grating as one shivered, chill water splashing over you. Eh?\"    Their eyes met. \"Sorry to upset your ideals,\" said Isbister with a sense  of devil-may-careish brilliance.    \"But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff for the matter of that),  really, as an artist--\" He laughed. \"It's so damned amateurish.\"    \"But the other thing,\" said the sleepless man irritably, \"the other  thing. No man can keep sane if night after night--\"    \"Have you been walking along this coast alone?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Silly sort of thing to do. If you'll excuse my saying so. Alone! As  you say; body fag is no cure for brain fag. Who told you to? No wonder;  walking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag, solitude, all the day  long, and then, I suppose, you go to bed and try very hard--eh?\"    Isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.    \"Look at these rocks!\" cried the seated man with a sudden force of  gesture. \"Look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever!  See the white spume rush into darkness under that great cliff. And this  blue vault, with the blinding sun pouring from the dome of it. It is  your world. You accept it, you rejoice in it. It warms and supports and  delights you. And for me--\"    He turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes and  bloodless lips. He spoke almost in a whisper. \"It is the garment of my  misery. The whole world... is the garment of my misery.\"    Isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them  and back to that face of despair. For a moment he was silent.    He started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. \"You get a  night's sleep,\" he said, \"and you won't see much misery out here. Take  my word for it.\"    He was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter. Only half  an hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored. Here was employment the  bare thought of which was righteous self-applause. He took possession  forthwith. It seemed to him that the first need of this exhausted being  was companionship He flung himself down on the steeply sloping turf  beside the motionless seated figure, and deployed forthwith into a  skirmishing line of gossip.    His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally  seaward, and spoke only in answer to Isbister's direct questions--and  not to all of those. But he made no sign of objection to this benevolent  intrusion upon his despair.    In a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister,  feeling that his unsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that they  should reascend the steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging the  view into Blackapit, he submitted quietly. Halfway up he began talking  to himself, and abruptly turned a ghastly face on his helper. \"What can  be happening?\" he asked with a gaunt illustrative hand. \"What can be  happening? Spin, spin, spin, spin. It goes round and round, round and  round for evermore.\"    He stood with his hand circling    \"It's all right, old chap,\" said Isbister with the air of an old friend.  \"Don't worry yourself. Trust to me.\"    The man dropped his hand and turned again. They went over the brow in  single file and to the headland beyond Penally, with the sleepless man  gesticulating ever and again, and speaking fragmentary things concerning  his whirling brain. At the headland they stood for a space by the seat  that looks into the dark mysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down.  Isbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened sufficiently  for them to walk abreast. He was enlarging upon the complex difficulty  of making Boscastle Harbour in bad weather, when suddenly and quite  irrelevantly his companion interrupted him again.    \"My head is not like what it was,\" he said, gesticulating for want  of expressive phrases. \"It's not like what it was. There is a sort of  oppression, a weight. No--not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like  a shadow, a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly across something  busy. Spin, spin into the darkness. The tumult of thought, the confusion,  the eddy and eddy. I can't express it. I can hardly keep my mind on  it--steadily enough to tell you.\"    He stopped feebly.    \"Don't trouble, old chap,\" said Isbister. \"I think I can understand. At  any rate, it don't matter very much just at present about telling me,  you know.\"    The sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them.  Isbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had  a fresh idea. \"Come down to my room,\" he said, \"and try a pipe. I can  show you some sketches "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7766"],[0,"A Dog of Flanders (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team                  A DOG OF FLANDERS    By Louisa De La Rame    (Ouida)      _Illustrated In Color By_ Maria L.

They were friends in a friendship closer than brotherhood. Nello was  a little Ardennois--Patrasche was a big Fleming. They were both of the  same age by length of years, yet one was still young, and the other was  already old. They had dwelt together almost all their days: both were  orphaned and destitute, and owed their lives to the same hand. It  had been the beginning of the tie between them, their first bond of  sympathy; and it had strengthened day by day, and had grown with  their growth, firm and indissoluble, until they loved one another very  greatly. Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little village--a  Flemish village a league from Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths of  pasture and corn-lands, with long lines of poplars and of alders bending  in the breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran through it. It  had about a score of houses and homesteads, with shutters of bright  green or sky-blue, and roofs rose-red or black and white, and walls  white-washed until they shone in the sun like snow. In the centre of the  village stood a windmill, placed on a little moss-grown slope: it was  a landmark to all the level country round. It had once been painted  scarlet, sails and all, but that had been in its infancy, half a century  or more earlier, when it had ground wheat for the soldiers of Napoleon;  and it was now a ruddy brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went  queerly by fits and starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the joints  from age, but it served the whole neighborhood, which would have thought  it almost as impious to carry grain elsewhere as to attend any other  religious service than the mass that was performed at the altar of the  little old gray church, with its conical steeple, which stood opposite  to it, and whose single bell rang morning, noon, and night with that  strange, subdued, hollow sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low  Countries seems to gain as an integral part of its melody.    Within sound of the little melancholy clock almost from their birth  upward, they had dwelt together, Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut  on the edge of the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising  in the north-east, beyond the great green plain of seeding grass and  spreading corn that stretched away from them like a tideless, changeless  sea. It was the hut of a very old man, of a very poor man--of old Jehan  Daas, who in his time had been a soldier, and who remembered the wars  that had trampled the country as oxen tread down the furrows, and who  had brought from his service nothing except a wound, which had made him  a cripple.    When old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty, his daughter had  died in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot, and had left him in legacy her  two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive to support himself,  but he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly, and it soon  became welcome and precious to him. Little Nello---which was but a pet  diminutive for Nicolas--throve with him, and the old man and the little  child lived in the poor little hut contentedly.    It was a very humble little mud-hut indeed, but it was clean and white  as a sea-shell, and stood in a small plot of garden-ground that yielded  beans and herbs and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor--many a  day they had nothing at all to eat. They never by any chance had enough:  to have had enough to eat would have been to have reached paradise at  once. But the old man was very gentle and good to the boy, and the boy  was a beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-hearted creature; and they  were happy on a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no more of  earth or heaven; save indeed that Patrasche should be always with them,  since without Patrasche where would they have been?    For Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their treasury and granary;  their store of gold and wand of wealth; their bread-winner and minister;  their only friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from them, they  must have laid themselves down and died likewise. Patrasche was body,  brains, hands, head, and feet to both of them: Patrasche was their very  life, their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple, and Nello  was but a child; and Patrasche was their dog.    [Illustration]    A dog of Flanders--yellow of hide, large of head and limb, with  wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the  muscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard  service. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled hard and cruelly from  sire to son in Flanders many a century--slaves of slaves, dogs of the  people, beasts of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived  straining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their  hearts on the flints of the streets.    Patrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their  days over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long,  shadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been  born to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been  fed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian  country, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had  known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar. Before he had entered  his thirteenth month he had become the property of a hardware-dealer,  who was accustomed to wander over the land north and south, from the  blue sea to the green mountains. They sold him for a small price,  because he was so young.    This man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of Patrasche was a life of  hell. To deal the tortures of hell on the animal creation is a way which  the Christians have of showing their belief in it. His purchaser was  a sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, who heaped his cart full with  pots and pans and flagons and buckets, and other wares of crockery and  brass and tin, and left Patrasche to draw the load as best he might,  whilst he himself lounged idly by the side in fat and sluggish ease,  smoking his black pipe and stopping at every wineshop or cafe on the  road.    Happily for Patrasche--or unhappily--he was very strong: he came of an  iron race, long born and bred to such cruel travail; so that he did  not die, but managed to drag on a wretched existence under the brutal  burdens, the scarifying lashes, the hunger, the thirst, the blows,  the curses, and the exhaustion which are the only wages with which the  Flemings repay the most patient and laborious of all their four-footed  victims. One day, after two years of this long and deadly agony,  Patrasche was going on as usual along one of the straight, dusty,  unlovely roads that lead to the city of Rubens. It was full midsummer,  and very warm. His cart was very heavy, piled high with goods in  metal and in earthenware. His owner sauntered on without noticing him  otherwise than by the crack of the whip as it curled round his quivering  loins. The Brabantois had paused to drink beer himself at every wayside  house, but he had forbidden Patrasche to stop a moment for a draught  from the canal. Going along thus, in the full sun, on a scorching  highway, having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, and, which was far  worse to him, not having tasted water for near twelve, being blind with  dust, sore with blows, and stupefied with the merciless weight which  dragged upon his loins, Patrasche staggered and foamed a little at the  mouth, and fell.    He fell in the middle of the white, dusty road, in the full glare of  the sun; he was sick unto death, and motionless. His master gave him the  only medicine in his pharmacy--kicks and oaths and blows with a cudgel  of oak, which had been often the only food and drink, the only wage and  reward, ever offered to him. But Patrasche was beyond the reach of any  torture or of any curses. Patrasche lay, dead to all appearances,  down in the white powder of the summer dust. After a while, finding  it useless to assail his ribs with punishment and his ears with  maledictions, the Brabantois--deeming life gone in him, or going so  nearly that his carcass was forever useless, unless indeed some one  should strip it of the skin for gloves--cursed him fiercely in farewell,  struck off the leathern bands of the harness, kicked his body aside into  the grass, and, groaning and muttering in savage wrath, pushed the cart  lazily along the road up-hill, and left the dying dog for the ants to  sting and for the crows to pick.    It was the last day before Kermesse away at Louvain, and the Brabantois  was in haste to reach the fair and get a good place for his truck of  brass wares. He was in fierce wrath, because Patrasche had been a strong  and much-enduring animal, and because he himself had now the hard task  of pushing his charette all the way to Louvain. But to stay to look  after Patrasche never entered his thoughts: the beast was dying and  useless, and he would steal, to replace him, the first large dog that he  found wandering alone out of sight of its master. Patrasche had cost him  nothing, or next to nothing, and for two long, cruel years had made him  toil ceaselessly in his service from sunrise to sunset, through summer  and winter, in fair weather and foul.    He had got a fair use and a good profit out of Patrasche: being human,  he was wise, and left the dog to draw his last breath alone in the  ditch, and "]]]
