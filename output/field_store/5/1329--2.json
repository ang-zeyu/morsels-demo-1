Frank Baum        Santa Claus lives in the Laughing Valley, where stands the big,  rambling castle in which his toys are manufactured.  His workmen,  selected from the ryls, knooks, pixies and fairies, live with him, and  every one is as busy as can be from one year's end to another.    It is called the Laughing Valley because everything there is happy  and gay.  The brook chuckles to itself as it leaps rollicking between  its green banks; the wind whistles merrily in the trees; the sunbeams  dance lightly over the soft grass, and the violets and wild flowers  look smilingly up from their green nests.  To laugh one needs to be  happy; to be happy one needs to be content.  And throughout the  Laughing Valley of Santa Claus contentment reigns supreme.    On one side is the mighty Forest of Burzee.  At the other side stands  the huge mountain that contains the Caves of the Daemons.  And between  them the Valley lies smiling and peaceful.    One would thing that our good old Santa Claus, who devotes his days to  making children happy, would have no enemies on all the earth; and, as  a matter of fact, for a long period of time he encountered nothing but  love wherever he might go.    But the Daemons who live in the mountain caves grew to hate Santa Claus  very much, and all for the simple reason that he made children happy.    The Caves of the Daemons are five in number.  A broad pathway leads  up to the first cave, which is a finely arched cavern at the foot of  the mountain, the entrance being beautifully carved and decorated.  In  it resides the Daemon of Selfishness.  Back of this is another cavern  inhabited by the Daemon of Envy.  The cave of the Daemon of Hatred is  next in order, and through this one passes to the home of the Daemon  of Malice--situated in a dark and fearful cave in the very heart of  the mountain.  I do not know what lies beyond this.  Some say there  are terrible pitfalls leading to death and destruction, and this may  very well be true.  However, from each one of the four caves mentioned  there is a small, narrow tunnel leading to the fifth cave--a cozy  little room occupied by the Daemon of Repentance.  And as the rocky  floors of these passages are well worn by the track of passing feet, I  judge that many wanderers in the Caves of the Daemons have escaped  through the tunnels to the abode of the Daemon of Repentance, who is  said to be a pleasant sort of fellow who gladly opens for one a little  door admitting you into fresh air and sunshine again.    Well, these Daemons of the Caves, thinking they had great cause to  dislike old Santa Claus, held a meeting one day to discuss the matter.    \"I'm really getting lonesome,\" said the Daemon of Selfishness.  \"For  Santa Claus distributes so many pretty Christmas gifts to all the  children that they become happy and generous, through his example, and  keep away from my cave.\"    \"I'm having the same trouble,\" rejoined the Daemon of Envy.  \"The  little ones seem quite content with Santa Claus, and there are few,  indeed, that I can coax to become envious.\"    \"And that makes it bad for me!\" declared the Daemon of Hatred.  \"For  if no children pass through the Caves of Selfishness and Envy, none  can get to MY cavern.\"    \"Or to mine,\" added the Daemon of Malice.    \"For my part,\" said the Daemon of Repentance, \"it is easily seen that  if children do not visit your caves they have no need to visit mine;  so that I am quite as neglected as you are.\"    \"And all because of this person they call Santa Claus!\" exclaimed the  Daemon of Envy.  \"He is simply ruining our business, and something  must be done at once.\"    To this they readily agreed; but what to do was another and more  difficult matter to settle.  They knew that Santa Claus worked all  through the year at his castle in the Laughing Valley, preparing the  gifts he was to distribute on Christmas Eve; and at first they  resolved to try to tempt him into their caves, that they might lead  him on to the terrible pitfalls that ended in destruction.    So the very next day, while Santa Claus was busily at work, surrounded  by his little band of assistants, the Daemon of Selfishness came to  him and said:    \"These toys are wonderfully bright and pretty.  Why do you not keep  them for yourself?  It's a pity to give them to those noisy boys and  fretful girls, who break and destroy them so quickly.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried the old graybeard, his bright eyes twinkling merrily  as he turned toward the tempting Daemon.  \"The boys and girls are  never so noisy and fretful after receiving my presents, and if I can  make them happy for one day in the year I am quite content.\"    So the Daemon went back to the others, who awaited him in their caves,  and said:    \"I have failed, for Santa Claus is not at all selfish.\"    The following day the Daemon of Envy visited Santa Claus.  Said he:  \"The toy shops are full of playthings quite as pretty as those you are  making.  What a shame it is that they should interfere with your  business!  They make toys by machinery much quicker than you can make  them by hand; and they sell them for money, while you get nothing at  all for your work.\"    But Santa Claus refused to be envious of the toy shops.    \"I can supply the little ones but once a year--on Christmas Eve,\" he  answered; \"for the children are many, and I am but one.  And as my  work is one of love and kindness I would be ashamed to receive money  for my little gifts.  But throughout all the year the children must be  amused in some way, and so the toy shops are able to bring much  happiness to my little friends.  I like the toy shops, and am glad to  see them prosper.\"    In spite of the second rebuff, the Daemon of Hatred thought he would  try to influence Santa Claus.  So the next day he entered the busy  workshop and said:    \"Good morning, Santa!  I have bad news for you.\"    \"Then run away, like a good fellow,\" answered Santa Claus.  \"Bad news  is something that should be kept secret and never told.\"    \"You cannot escape this, however,\" declared the Daemon; \"for in the  world are a good many who do not believe in Santa Claus, and these you  are bound to hate bitterly, since they have so wronged you.\"    \"Stuff and rubbish!\" cried Santa.    \"And there are others who resent your making children happy and who  sneer at you and call you a foolish old rattlepate!  You are quite  right to hate such base slanderers, and you ought to be revenged upon  them for their evil words.\"    \"But I don't hate 'em!\" exclaimed Santa Claus positively.  \"Such  people do me no real harm, but merely render themselves and their  children unhappy.  Poor things!  I'd much rather help them any day  than injure them.\"    Indeed, the Daemons could not tempt old Santa Claus in any way.  On  the contrary, he was shrewd enough to see that their object in  visiting him was to make mischief and trouble, and his cheery laughter  disconcerted the evil ones and showed to them the folly of such an  undertaking.  So they abandoned honeyed words and determined to use force.    It was well known that no harm can come to Santa Claus while he is in  the Laughing Valley, for the fairies, and ryls, and knooks all protect  him.  But on Christmas Eve he drives his reindeer out into the big  world, carrying a sleighload of toys and pretty gifts to the children;  and this was the time and the occasion when his enemies had the best  chance to injure him.  So the Daemons laid their plans and awaited the  arrival of Christmas Eve.    The moon shone big and white in the sky, and the snow lay crisp and  sparkling on the ground as Santa Claus cracked his whip and sped away  out of the Valley into the great world beyond.  The roomy sleigh was  packed full with huge sacks of toys, and as the reindeer dashed onward  our jolly old Santa laughed and whistled and sang for very joy.  For  in all his merry life this was the one day in the year when he was  happiest--the day he lovingly bestowed the treasures of his workshop  upon the little children.    It would be a busy night for him, he well knew.  As he whistled and  shouted and cracked his whip again, he reviewed in mind all the towns  and cities and farmhouses where he was expected, and figured that he  had just enough presents to go around and make every child happy.  The  reindeer knew exactly what was expected of them, and dashed along so  swiftly that their feet scarcely seemed to touch the snow-covered ground.    Suddenly a strange thing happened: a rope shot through the moonlight  and a big noose that was in the end of it settled over the arms and  body of Santa Claus and drew tight.  Before he could resist or even  cry out he was jerked from the seat of the sleigh and tumbled head  foremost into a snowbank, while the reindeer rushed onward with the  load of toys and carried it quickly out of sight and sound.    Such a surprising experience confused old Santa for a moment, and when  he had collected his senses he found that the wicked Daemons had  pulled him from the snowdrift and bound him tightly with many coils of  the stout rope.  And then they carried the kidnapped Santa Claus away  to their mountain, where they thrust the prisoner into a secret cave  and chained him to the rocky wall so that he could not escape.    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the Daemons, rubbing their hands together with cruel  glee.  \"What will the children do now?  How they will cry and scold  and storm when they find there are no toys in their stockings and no  gifts on their Christmas trees!  And what a lot of punishment they  will receive from their parents, and how they will flock to our Caves  of Selfishness, and Envy, and Hatred, and Malice!  We have done a  mighty clever thing, we Daemons of the Caves!\"    Now it so chanced that on this Christmas Eve the good Santa Claus had  taken with him in his sleigh Nuter the Ryl, Peter the Knook, Kilter  the Pixie, and a small fairy named Wisk--hi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#1)"],[1,"Life and Adventures of Santa Claus      by    L.

Nurse used to sing of it  when I was a child.  She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close  together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their  branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and  queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire  forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the  ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the  mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.    The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal  beneath its shade.  Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it  seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with  never-ending delights.    For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the  silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks,  the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.    Yet Burzee has its inhabitants--for all this.  Nature peopled it in the  beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs.  As long as the Forest  stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet  immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.    Civilization has never yet reached Burzee.  Will it ever, I wonder?        2.  The Child of the Forest    Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it  mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph  named Necile.  She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and  her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak.  Once every  year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile  held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank  therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest.  So you see she was a nymph  of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded  because of her beauty and grace.    When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not  have told; the great Ak himself could not have told.  It was long ago  when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and  to minister to the wants of the young trees.  Then, on some day not  remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and  slim as the sapling she was created to guard.    Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in  the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint  pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting  and sweet.  For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs  dress in that color and know no other so desirable.  Her dainty feet  were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than  her silken tresses.    Necile's duties were few and simple.  She kept hurtful weeds from  growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her  charges.  She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in  flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped  and died from the poisonous contact.  In dry seasons she carried water  from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty  dependents.    That was in the beginning.  The weeds had now learned to avoid the  forests where wood-nymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared  come nigh; the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the  drought better than when fresh-sprouted.  So Necile's duties were  lessened, and time grew laggard, while succeeding years became more  tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's joyous spirit loved.    Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement.  Each full moon they  danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen.  There were also the Feast of  Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf  Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day.  But these periods of  enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.    That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by  Necile's sisters.  It came upon her only after many years of brooding.  But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had  no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real  interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest  nymphs.  The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in  search of adventure.    While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great  Ak visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs as was  their wont--to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that  fell from his lips.  Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees  everything, and knows more than the sons of men.    That night he held the Queen's hand, for he loved the nymphs as a  father loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her  sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke.    \"We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,\" said Ak,  stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, \"that we know nothing of the  sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who  inhabit the open spaces of the earth.  They are not of our race, it is  true, yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves.  Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted  to stop and banish the poor thing's misery.  Yet suffering, in  moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to  interfere with the laws of Nature.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the  Master Woodsman, \"it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often  assisted these hapless mortals.\"    Ak smiled.    \"Sometimes,\" he replied, \"when they are very young--'children,' the  mortals call them--I have stopped to rescue them from misery.  The men  and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature  has imposed upon them.  But the helpless infants, the innocent children  of men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able  to bear the trials of humanity.  So I feel I am justified in assisting  them.  Not long ago--a year, maybe--I found four poor children huddled  in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death.  Their parents had gone to a  neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little  ones while they were absent.  But a storm arose and drifted the snow in  their path, so they were long on the road.  Meantime the fire went out  and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.\"    \"Poor things!\" murmured the Queen softly.  \"What did you do?\"    \"I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe  upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where  the children lay.  Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until  their parents came.\"    \"I am glad you did thus,\" said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master;  and Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a  whisper: \"I, too, am glad!\"    \"And this very night,\" continued Ak, \"as I came to the edge of Burzee I  heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant.  I looked  about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite  naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously.  Not far away, screened  by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the  infant for her evening meal.\"    \"And what did you do, Ak?\" asked the Queen, breathlessly.    \"Not much, being in a hurry to greet my nymphs.  But I commanded  Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its  hunger.  And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all  beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.\"    \"I am glad you did thus,\" said the good Queen again, in a tone of  relief; but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph,  filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.    Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she  reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously  about her.  Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the  Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths.    Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give  pause to her dainty feet.  She had decided to see with her own eyes  this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of  man.  All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among  them.  Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the  grass.  But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the  milk drawn from Shiegra.  It was not old enough to know what peril  means; if it did not feel hunger it was content.    Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the  sward, her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a  gossamer cloud.  Her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and  surprise, but, most of all, a tender, womanly pity.  The babe was  newborn, chubby and pink.  It was entirely helpless."]]]
