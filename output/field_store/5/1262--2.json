LUCAS        \"For violence and hurt tangle every man in their toils, and for the most  part fall on the head of him from whom they had their rise; nor is it  easy for one who by his act breaks the common pact of peace to lead a  calm and quiet life.\"    Lucretius on the Nature of Things.

I REMEMBER my father telling me that sitting up late one night talking  with Tennyson, the latter remarked that he had not kept such late  hours since a recent visit of Jowett. On that occasion the poet and  the philosopher had talked together well into the small hours of the  morning. My father asked Tennyson what was the subject of conversation  that had so engrossed them. \"Murders,\" replied Tennyson. It would have  been interesting to have heard Tennyson and Jowett discussing such a  theme. The fact is a tribute to the interest that crime has for many  men of intellect and imagination. Indeed, how could it be otherwise?  Rob history and fiction of crime, how tame and colourless would be the  residue! We who are living and enduring in the presence of one of the  greatest crimes on record, must realise that trying as this period of  the world's history is to those who are passing through it, in the hands  of some great historian it may make very good reading for posterity.  Perhaps we may find some little consolation in this fact, like the  unhappy victims of famous freebooters such as Jack Sheppard or Charley  Peace.    But do not let us flatter ourselves. Do not let us, in all the pomp and  circumstance of stately history, blind ourselves to the fact that the  crimes of Frederick, or Napoleon, or their successors, are in essence no  different from those of Sheppard or Peace. We must not imagine that  the bad man who happens to offend against those particular laws which  constitute the criminal code belongs to a peculiar or atavistic type,  that he is a man set apart from the rest of his fellow-men by mental or  physical peculiarities. That comforting theory of the Lombroso school  has been exploded, and the ordinary inmates of our prisons shown to be  only in a very slight degree below the average in mental and physical  fitness of the normal man, a difference easily explained by the  environment and conditions in which the ordinary criminal is bred.    A certain English judge, asked as to the general characteristics of the  prisoners tried before him, said: \"They are just like other people;  in fact, I often think that, but for different opportunities and other  accidents, the prisoner and I might very well be in one another's  places.\" \"Greed, love of pleasure,\" writes a French judge, \"lust,  idleness, anger, hatred, revenge, these are the chief causes of crime.  These passions and desires are shared by rich and poor alike, by the  educated and uneducated. They are inherent in human nature; the germ is  in every man.\"    Convicts represent those wrong-doers who have taken to a particular form  of wrong-doing punishable by law. Of the larger army of bad men  they represent a minority, who have been found out in a peculiarly  unsatisfactory kind of misconduct. There are many men, some lying,  unscrupulous, dishonest, others cruel, selfish, vicious, who go through  life without ever doing anything that brings them within the scope of  the criminal code, for whose offences the laws of society provide no  punishment. And so it is with some of those heroes of history who have  been made the theme of fine writing by gifted historians.    Mr. Basil Thomson, the present head of the Criminal Investigation  Department, has said recently that a great deal of crime is due to a  spirit of \"perverse adventure\" on the part of the criminal. The same  might be said with equal justice of the exploits of Alexander the Great  and half the monarchs and conquerors of the world, whom we are taught  in our childhood's days to look up to as shining examples of all that a  great man should be. Because crimes are played on a great stage instead  of a small, that is no reason why our moral judgment should be suspended  or silenced. Class Machiavelli and Frederick the Great as a couple of  rascals fit to rank with Jonathan Wild, and we are getting nearer a  perception of what constitutes the real criminal. \"If,\" said Frederick  the Great to his minister, Radziwill, \"there is anything to be gained  by it, we will be honest; if deception is necessary, let us be cheats.\"  These are the very sentiments of Jonathan Wild.    Crime, broadly speaking, is the attempt by fraud or violence to possess  oneself of something belonging to another, and as such the cases of it  in history are as clear as those dealt with in criminal courts. Germany  to-day has been guilty of a perverse and criminal adventure, the outcome  of that false morality applied to historical transactions, of which  Carlyle's life of Frederick is a monumental example. In that book  we have a man whose instincts in more ways than one were those of a  criminal, held up for our admiration, in the same way that the same  writer fell into dithyrambic praise over a villain called Francia, a  former President of Paraguay. A most interesting work might be written  on the great criminals of history, and might do something towards  restoring that balance of moral judgment in historical transactions, for  the perversion of which we are suffering to-day.    In the meantime we must be content to study in the microcosm of ordinary  crime those instincts, selfish, greedy, brutal which, exploited often  by bad men in the so-called cause of nations, have wrought such havoc  to the happiness of mankind. It is not too much to say that in every  man there dwell the seeds of crime; whether they grow or are stifled  in their growth by the good that is in us is a chance mysteriously  determined. As children of nature we must not be surprised if our  instincts are not all that they should be. \"In sober truth,\" writes  John Stuart Mill, \"nearly all the things for which men are hanged or  imprisoned for doing to one another are nature's everyday performances,\"  and in another passage: \"The course of natural phenomena being replete  with everything which when committed by human beings is most worthy of  abhorrence, anyone who endeavoured in his actions to imitate the natural  course of things would be universally seen and acknowledged to be the  wickedest of men.\"    Here is explanation enough for the presence of evil in our natures, that  instinct to destroy which finds comparatively harmless expression in  certain forms of taking life, which is at its worst when we fall  to taking each other's. It is to check an inconvenient form of the  expression of this instinct that we punish murderers with death. We must  carry the definition of murder a step farther before we can count  on peace or happiness in this world. We must concentrate all our  strength on fighting criminal nature, both in ourselves and in the  world around us. With the destructive forces of nature we are waging a  perpetual struggle for our very existence. Why dissipate our strength by  fighting among ourselves? By enlarging our conception of crime we move  towards that end. What is anti-social, whether it be written in the  pages of the historian or those of the Newgate Calendar, must in the  future be regarded with equal abhorrence and subjected to equally sure  punishment. Every professor of history should now and then climb down  from the giddy heights of Thucydides and Gibbon and restore his moral  balance by comparing the acts of some of his puppets with those of their  less fortunate brethren who have dangled at the end of a rope. If this  war is to mean anything to posterity, the crime against humanity must be  judged in the future by the same rigid standard as the crime against the  person.    The individual criminals whose careers are given in this book have been  chosen from among their fellows for their pre-eminence in character or  achievement. Some of the cases, such as Butler, Castaing and Holmes, are  new to most English readers.    Charles Peace is the outstanding popular figure in nineteenth-century  crime. He is the type of the professional criminal who makes crime a  business and sets about it methodically and persistently to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#1)"],[1,"by Charles Keller with  OmniPage Professional OCR software  donated by Caere Corporation, 1-800-535-7226.

Having  recognised that there are no phenomena of which the first cause  is still accessible, science has resumed the examination of her  ancient certitudes, and has proved their fragility.  To-day she  sees her ancient principles vanishing one by one.  Mechanics is  losing its axioms, and matter, formerly the eternal substratum of  the worlds, becomes a simple aggregate of ephemeral forces in  transitory condensation.    Despite its conjectural side, by virtue of which it to some  extent escapes the severest form of criticism, history has not  been free from this universal revision.  There is no longer a  single one of its phases of which we can say that it is certainly  known.  What appeared to be definitely acquired is now once more  put in question.    Among the events whose study seemed completed was the French  Revolution.  Analysed by several generations of writers, one  might suppose it to be perfectly elucidated.  What new thing can  be said of it, except in modification of some of its details?    And yet its most positive defenders are beginning to hesitate in  their judgments.  Ancient evidence proves to be far from  impeccable.  The faith in dogmas once held sacred is shaken.  The  latest literature of the Revolution betrays these uncertainties.  Having related, men are more and more chary of drawing  conclusions.    Not only are the heroes of this great drama discussed without  indulgence, but thinkers are asking whether the new dispensation  which followed the ancien regime would not have established  itself naturally, without violence, in the course of progressive  civilisation.  The results obtained no longer seem in  correspondence either with their immediate cost or with the  remoter consequences which the Revolution evoked from the  possibilities of history."]]]
