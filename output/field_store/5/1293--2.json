Good morrow, Hylas: I did not expect to find you abroad so  early.    HYLAS.  It is indeed something unusual; but my thoughts were so taken up  with a subject I was discoursing of last night, that finding I could not  sleep, I resolved to rise and take a turn in the garden.    PHIL.  It happened well, to let you see what innocent and agreeable  pleasures you lose every morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of the  day, or a more delightful season of the year? That purple sky, those wild  but sweet notes of birds, the fragrant bloom upon the trees and flowers,  the gentle influence of the rising sun, these and a thousand nameless  beauties of nature inspire the soul with secret transports; its faculties  too being at this time fresh and lively, are fit for those meditations,  which the solitude of a garden and tranquillity of the morning naturally  dispose us to. But I am afraid I interrupt your thoughts: for you seemed  very intent on something.    HYL.  It is true, I was, and shall be obliged to you if you will permit  me to go on in the same vein; not that I would by any means deprive  myself of your company, for my thoughts always flow more easily in  conversation with a friend, than when I am alone: but my request is, that  you would suffer me to impart my reflexions to you.    PHIL.  With all my heart, it is what I should have requested myself if  you had not prevented me.    HYL.  I was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all ages,  through an affectation of being distinguished from the vulgar, or some  unaccountable turn of thought, pretended either to believe nothing at  all, or to believe the most extravagant things in the world. This however  might be borne, if their paradoxes and scepticism did not draw after them  some consequences of general disadvantage to mankind. But the mischief  lieth here; that when men of less leisure see them who are supposed  to have spent their whole time in the pursuits of knowledge professing an  entire ignorance of all things, or advancing such notions as are  repugnant to plain and commonly received principles, they will be tempted  to entertain suspicions concerning the most important truths, which they  had hitherto held sacred and unquestionable.    PHIL.  I entirely agree with you, as to the ill tendency of the affected  doubts of some philosophers, and fantastical conceits of others. I am  even so far gone of late in this way of thinking, that I have quitted  several of the sublime notions I had got in their schools for vulgar  opinions. And I give it you on my word; since this revolt from  metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense, I  find my understanding strangely enlightened, so that I can now easily  comprehend a great many things which before were all mystery and riddle.    HYL.  I am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts I heard of you.    PHIL.  Pray, what were those?    HYL.  You were represented, in last night's conversation, as one who  maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind  of man, to wit, that there is no such thing as MATERIAL SUBSTANCE in  the world.    PHIL.  That there is no such thing as what PHILOSOPHERS CALL MATERIAL  SUBSTANCE, I am seriously persuaded: but, if I were made to see anything  absurd or sceptical in this, I should then have the same reason to  renounce this that I imagine I have now to reject the contrary opinion.    HYL.  What I can anything be more fantastical, more repugnant to Common  Sense, or a more manifest piece of Scepticism, than to believe there is  no such thing as MATTER?    PHIL.  Softly, good Hylas. What if it should prove that you, who hold  there is, are, by virtue of that opinion, a greater sceptic, and maintain  more paradoxes and repugnances to Common Sense, than I who believe no  such thing?    HYL.  You may as soon persuade me, the part is greater than the whole,  as that, in order to avoid absurdity and Scepticism, I should ever be  obliged to give up my opinion in this point.    PHIL.  Well then, are you content to admit that opinion for true, which  upon examination shall appear most agreeable to Common Sense, and remote  from Scepticism?    HYL.  With all my heart. Since you are for raising disputes about  the plainest things in nature, I am content for once to hear what you  have to say.    PHIL.  Pray, Hylas, what do you mean by a SCEPTIC?    HYL.  I mean what all men mean--one that doubts of everything.    PHIL.  He then who entertains no doubts concerning some particular  point, with regard to that point cannot be thought a sceptic.    HYL.  I agree with you.    PHIL.  Whether doth doubting consist in embracing the affirmative or  negative side of a question?    HYL.  In neither; for whoever understands English cannot but know that  DOUBTING signifies a suspense between both.    PHIL.  He then that denies any point, can no more be said to doubt of  it, than he who affirmeth it with the same degree of assurance.    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  And, consequently, for such his denial is no more to be esteemed  a sceptic than the other.    HYL.  I acknowledge it.    PHIL.  How cometh it to pass then, Hylas, that you pronounce me A  SCEPTIC, because I deny what you affirm, to wit, the existence of  Matter? Since, for aught you can tell, I am as peremptory in my denial,  as you in your affirmation.    HYL.  Hold, Philonous, I have been a little out in my definition; but  every false step a man makes in discourse is not to be insisted on. I  said indeed that a SCEPTIC was one who doubted of everything; but I  should have added, or who denies the reality and truth of things.    PHIL.  What things? Do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences?  But these you know are universal intellectual notions, and consequently  independent of Matter. The denial therefore of this doth not imply the  denying them.    HYL.  I grant it. But are there no other things? What think you of  distrusting the senses, of denying the real existence of sensible things,  or pretending to know nothing of them. Is not this sufficient to  denominate a man a SCEPTIC?    PHIL.  Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the  reality of sensible things, or professes the greatest ignorance of them;  since, if I take you rightly, he is to be esteemed the greatest  SCEPTIC?    HYL.  That is what I desire.    PHIL.  What mean you by Sensible Things?    HYL.  Those things which are perceived by the senses. Can you imagine  that I mean anything else?    PHIL.  Pardon me, Hylas, if I am desirous clearly to apprehend your  notions, since this may much shorten our inquiry. Suffer me then to ask  you this farther question. Are those things only perceived by the senses  which are perceived immediately? Or, may those things properly be said to  be SENSIBLE which are perceived mediately, or not without the  intervention of others?    HYL.  I do not sufficiently understand you.    PHIL.  In reading a book, what I immediately perceive are the letters;  but mediately, or by means of these, are suggested to my mind the notions  of God, virtue, truth, &c. Now, that the letters are truly sensible  things, or perceived by sense, there is no doubt: but I would know  whether you take the things suggested by them to be so too.    HYL.  No, certainly: it were absurd to think GOD or VIRTUE sensible  things; though they may be signified and suggested to the mind by  sensible marks, with which they have an arbitrary connexion.    PHIL.  It seems then, that by SENSIBLE THINGS you mean those only  which can be perceived IMMEDIATELY by sense?    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  Doth it not follow from this, that though I see one part of the  sky red, and another blue, and that my reason doth thence evidently  conclude there must be some cause of that diversity of colours, yet that  cause cannot be said to be a sensible thing, or perceived by the sense of  seeing?    HYL.  It doth.    PHIL.  In like manner, though I hear variety of sounds, yet I cannot be  said to hear the causes of those sounds?    HYL.  You cannot.    PHIL.  And when by my touch I perceive a thing to be hot and heavy, I  cannot say, with any truth or propriety, that I feel the cause of its  heat or weight?    HYL.  To prevent any more questions of this kind, I tell you once for  all, that by SENSIBLE THINGS I mean those only which are perceived by  sense; and that in truth the senses perceive nothing which they do not  perceive IMMEDIATELY: for they make no inferences. The deducing  therefore of causes or occasions from effects and appearances, which  alone are perceived by sense, entirely relates to reason.    PHIL.  This point then is agreed between us--That SENSIBLE THINGS ARE  THOSE ONLY WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED BY SENSE. You will farther  inform me, whether we immediately perceive by sight anything beside  light, and colours, and figures; or by hearing, anything but sounds; by  the palate, anything beside tastes; by the smell, beside odours; or by  the touch, more than tangible qualities.    HYL.  We do not.    PHIL.  It seems, therefore, that if you take away all sensible  qualities, there remains nothing sensible?    HYL.  I grant it.    PHIL.  Sensible things therefore are nothing else but so many  sensible qualities, or combinations of sensible qualities?    HYL.  Nothing else.    PHIL.  HEAT then is a sensible thing?    HYL.  Certainly.    PHIL.  Doth the REALITY of sensible things consist in being perceived?  or, is it something distinct from their being perceived, and that bears  no relation to the mind?    HYL.  To EXIST is one thing, and to be PERCEIVED is another.    PHIL.  I speak with regard to sensible things only. And of these I ask,  whether by their real existence you mean a subsistence exterior to the  mind, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#1)"],[1,"Little Australians      by    Ethel Turner          CONTENTS    CHAPTER         I  Chiefly Descriptive      II  Fowl for Dinner     III  Virtue Not Always Rewarded      IV  The General Sees Active Service       V  \"Next Monday Morning\"      VI  The Sweetness of Sweet Sixteen     VII  \"What Say You to Falling in Love?\"    VIII  A Catapult and a Catastrophe      IX  Consequences       X  Bunty in the Light of a Hero      XI  The Truant     XII  Swish, Swish!

If you imagine you are going to read of model children, with  perhaps; a naughtily inclined one to point a moral, you had better lay  down the book immediately and betake yourself to 'Sandford and Merton'  or similar standard juvenile works.  Not one of the seven is really  good, for the very excellent reason that Australian children never are.    In England, and America, and Africa, and Asia, the little folks may  be paragons of virtue, I know little about them.    But in Australia a model child is--I say it not without  thankfulness--an unknown quantity.    It may be that the miasmas of naughtiness develop best in the  sunny brilliancy of our atmosphere.  It may be that the land and  the people are young-hearted together, and the children's spirits not  crushed and saddened by the shadow of long years' sorrowful  history.    There is a lurking sparkle of joyousness and rebellion and mischief  in nature here, and therefore in children.    Often the light grows dull and the bright colouring fades to  neutral tints in the dust and heat of the day.  But when it  survives play-days and school-days, circumstances alone determine  whether the electric sparkle shall go to play will-o'-the-wisp  with the larrikin type, or warm the breasts of the spirited,  single-hearted, loyal ones who alone can \"advance Australia.\"    Enough of such talk.  Let me tell you about my seven select  spirits.  They are having nursery tea at the present moment with  a minimum of comfort and a maximum of noise, so if you can bear a  deafening babel of voices and an unmusical clitter-clatter of  crockery I will take you inside the room and introduce them to  you.    Nursery tea is more an English institution than an Australian one;  there is a kind of _bon camaraderie_ feeling between parents and  young folks here, and an utter absence of veneration on the part of  the latter.  So even in the most wealthy families it seldom  happens that the parents dine in solemn state alone, while the  children are having a simple tea in another room: they all  assemble around the same board, and the young ones partake of the  same dishes, and sustain their parts in the conversation right  nobly.    But, given a very particular and rather irritable father, and  seven children with excellent lungs and tireless tongues, what  could you do but give them separate rooms to take their meals in?    Captain Woolcot, the father, in addition to this division, had had  thick felt put over the swing door upstairs, but the noise used to  float down to the dining-room in cheerful, unconcerned manner  despite it.    It was a nursery without a nurse, too, so that partly accounted  for it.  Meg, the eldest, was only sixteen, and could not be  expected to be much of a disciplinarian, and the slatternly but  good-natured girl, who was supposed to combine the duties of  nursery-maid and housemaid, had so much to do in her second  capacity that the first suffered considerably.  She used to lay  the nursery meals when none of the little girls could be found to  help her, and bundle on the clothes of the two youngest in the  morning, but beyond that the seven had to manage for themselves.    The mother? you ask.    Oh, she was only twenty--just a lovely, laughing-faced girl, whom  they all adored, and who was very little steadier and very  little more of a housekeeper than Meg.  Only the youngest of the  brood was hers, but she seemed just as fond of the other six as  of it, and treated it more as if it were a very entertaining  kitten than a real live baby, and her very own.    Indeed at Misrule--that is the name their house always went by,  though I believe there was a different one painted above the  balcony--that baby seemed a gigantic joke to everyone.  The  Captain generally laughed when he saw it, tossed it in the air,  and then asked someone to take it quickly.    The children dragged it all over the country with them, dropped  it countless times, forgot its pelisse on wet days, muffled it up  when it was hot, gave it the most astounding things to eat, and yet  it was the healthiest, prettiest, and most sunshiny baby that  ever sucked a wee fat thumb.    It was never called \"Baby,\" either; that was the special name of  the next youngest.  Captain Woolcot had said, \"Hello, is this the  General?\" when the little, red, staring-eyed morsel had been put  into his arms, and the name had come into daily use, though I  believe at the christening service the curate did say something  about Francis Rupert Burnand Woolcot.    Baby was four, and was a little soft fat thing with pretty  cuddlesome ways, great smiling eyes, and lips very kissable when  they were free from jam.    She had a weakness, however, for making the General cry, or she  would have been really almost a model child.  Innumerable times  she had been found pressing its poor little chest to make it  \"squeak;\" and even pinching its tiny arms, or pulling its  innocent nose, just for the strange pleasure of hearing the yells  of despair it instantly set up.  Captain Woolcot ascribed the  peculiar tendency to the fact that the child had once had a  dropsical-looking woolly lamb, from which the utmost pressure would  only elicit the faintest possible squeak: he said it was only  natural that now she had something so amenable to squeezing she  should want to utilize it.    Bunty was six, and was fat and very lazy.  He hated scouting at  cricket, he loathed the very name of a paper-chase, and as for  running an errand, why, before anyone could finish saying something  was wanted he would have utterly disappeared.  He was rather small  for his age;-and I don't think had ever been seen with a clean face.  Even at church, though the immediate front turned to the minister  might be passable, the people in the next pew had always an  uninterrupted view of the black rim where washing operations had  left off.    The next on the list--I am going from youngest to oldest, you  see--was the \"show\" Woolcot, as Pip, the eldest boy, used to say.  You have seen those exquisite child-angel faces on Raphael Tuck's  Christmas cards?  I think the artist must just have dreamed of  Nell, and then reproduced the vision imperfectly.  She was ten,  and had a little fairy-like figure, gold hair clustering in wonderful  waves and curls around her face, soft hazel eyes, and a little  rosebud of a mouth.  She was not conceited either, her family took  care of that--Pip would have nipped such a weakness very sternly  in its earliest bud; but in some way if there was a pretty ribbon  to spare, or a breadth of bright material; just enough for one little  frock, it fell as a matter of course to her.    Judy was only three years older, but was the greatest contrast  imaginable.  Nellie used to move rather slowly about, and would  have made a picture in any attitude.  Judy I think, was never  seen to walk, and seldom looked picturesque.  If she did not dash  madly to the place she wished to get to, she would progress by a  series of jumps, bounds, and odd little skips.  She was very thin,  as people generally are who have quicksilver instead of blood in  their veins; she had a small, eager, freckled face, with very,  bright dark eyes, a small, determined mouth, and a mane of untidy,  curly dark hair that was the trial of her life.    Without doubt she was the worst of the seven, probably because she  was the cleverest.  Her brilliant inventive powers plunged them all  into ceaseless scrapes, and though she often bore the brunt of the  blame with equanimity, they used to turn round, not infrequently,  and upbraid her for suggesting the mischief.  She had been  christened \"Helen,\" which in no way account's for \"Judy,\" but  then nicknames are rather unaccountable things sometimes, are they  not?  Bunty said it was because she was always popping and  jerking herself about like the celebrated wife of Punch, and  there really is something in that.  Her other name, \"Fizz,\" is  easier to understand; Pip used to say he never yet had seen the  ginger ale that effervesced and bubbled and made the noise that  Judy did.    I haven't introduced you to Pip yet, have I?  He was a little like  Judy, only handsomer and taller, and he was fourteen, and had as  good an opinion of himself and as poor a one of girls as boys of  that age generally have.    Meg was the eldest of the family, and had a long, fair plait that  Bunty used to delight in pulling; a sweet, rather dreamy face,  and a powdering of pretty freckles that occasioned her much  tribulation of spirit.    It was generally believed in the family that she wrote poetry  and stories, and even kept a diary, but no one had ever seen a  vestige of her papers, she kept them so carefully locked up in  her old tin hat-box.  Their father, had you asked them they would  all have replied with considerable pride, was \"a military man,\"  and much from home.  He did not understand children at all, and was  always grumbling at the noise they made, and the money they cost.  Still, I think he was rather proud of"]]]
