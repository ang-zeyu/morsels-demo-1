ONLY THE GUARDIAN    American tourists, sure appreciators of all that is ancient and  picturesque in England, invariably come to a halt, holding their breath  in a sudden catch of wonder, as they pass through the half-ruinous  gateway which admits to the Close of Wrychester. Nowhere else in England  is there a fairer prospect of old-world peace. There before their eyes,  set in the centre of a great green sward, fringed by tall elms and giant  beeches, rises the vast fabric of the thirteenth-century Cathedral, its  high spire piercing the skies in which rooks are for ever circling and  calling. The time-worn stone, at a little distance delicate as lacework,  is transformed at different hours of the day into shifting shades of  colour, varying from grey to purple: the massiveness of the great nave  and transepts contrasts impressively with the gradual tapering of  the spire, rising so high above turret and clerestory that it at last  becomes a mere line against the ether. In morning, as in afternoon, or  in evening, here is a perpetual atmosphere of rest; and not around the  great church alone, but in the quaint and ancient houses which fence in  the Close. Little less old than the mighty mass of stone on which their  ivy-framed windows look, these houses make the casual observer feel  that here, if anywhere in the world, life must needs run smoothly. Under  those high gables, behind those mullioned windows, in the beautiful  old gardens lying between the stone porches and the elm-shadowed lawn,  nothing, one would think, could possibly exist but leisured and pleasant  existence: even the busy streets of the old city, outside the crumbling  gateway, seem, for the moment, far off.    In one of the oldest of these houses, half hidden behind trees and  shrubs in a corner of the Close, three people sat at breakfast one fine  May morning. The room in which they sat was in keeping with the old  house and its surroundings--a long, low-ceilinged room, with oak  panelling around its walls, and oak beams across its roof--a room of  old furniture, and, old pictures, and old books, its antique atmosphere  relieved by great masses of flowers, set here and there in old china  bowls: through its wide windows, the casements of which were thrown wide  open, there was an inviting prospect of a high-edged flower garden, and,  seen in vistas through the trees and shrubberies, of patches of the west  front of the Cathedral, now sombre and grey in shadow. But on the garden  and into this flower-scented room the sun was shining gaily through the  trees, and making gleams of light on the silver and china on the table  and on the faces of the three people who sat around it.    Of these three, two were young, and the third was one of those men  whose age it is never easy to guess--a tall, clean-shaven, bright-eyed,  alert-looking man, good-looking in a clever, professional sort of way, a  man whom no one could have taken for anything but a member of one of the  learned callings. In some lights he looked no more than forty: a strong  light betrayed the fact that his dark hair had a streak of grey in  it, and was showing a tendency to whiten about the temples. A  strong, intellectually superior man, this, scrupulously groomed and  well-dressed, as befitted what he really was--a medical practitioner  with an excellent connection amongst the exclusive society of a  cathedral town. Around him hung an undeniable air of content and  prosperity--as he turned over a pile of letters which stood by his  plate, or glanced at the morning newspaper which lay at his elbow, it  was easy to see that he had no cares beyond those of the day, and that  they--so far as he knew then--were not likely to affect him greatly.  Seeing him in these pleasant domestic circumstances, at the head of  his table, with abundant evidences of comfort and refinement and modest  luxury about him, any one would have said, without hesitation, that Dr.  Mark Ransford was undeniably one of the fortunate folk of this world.    The second person of the three was a boy of apparently seventeen--a  well-built, handsome lad of the senior schoolboy type, who was devoting  himself in business-like fashion to two widely-differing pursuits--one,  the consumption of eggs and bacon and dry toast; the other, the study  of a Latin textbook, which he had propped up in front of him against the  old-fashioned silver cruet. His quick eyes wandered alternately between  his book and his plate; now and then he muttered a line or two to  himself. His companions took no notice of these combinations of eating  and learning: they knew from experience that it was his way to make up  at breakfast-time for the moments he had stolen from his studies the  night before.    It was not difficult to see that the third member of the party, a girl  of nineteen or twenty, was the boy's sister. Each had a wealth of brown  hair, inclining, in the girl's case to a shade that had tints of gold in  it; each had grey eyes, in which there was a mixture of blue; each had  a bright, vivid colour; each was undeniably good-looking and eminently  healthy. No one would have doubted that both had lived a good deal of  an open-air existence: the boy was already muscular and sinewy: the  girl looked as if she was well acquainted with the tennis racket and  the golf-stick. Nor would any one have made the mistake of thinking  that these two were blood relations of the man at the head of the  table--between them and him there was not the least resemblance of  feature, of colour, or of manner.    While the boy learnt the last lines of his Latin, and the doctor turned  over the newspaper, the girl read a letter--evidently, from the large  sprawling handwriting, the missive of some girlish correspondent. She  was deep in it when, from one of the turrets of the Cathedral, a bell  began to ring. At that, she glanced at her brother.    \"There's Martin, Dick!\" she said. \"You'll have to hurry.\"    Many a long year before that, in one of the bygone centuries, a worthy  citizen of Wrychester, Martin by name, had left a sum of money to the  Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral on condition that as long as ever the  Cathedral stood, they should cause to be rung a bell from its smaller  bell-tower for three minutes before nine o'clock every morning, all the  year round. What Martin's object had been no one now knew--but this bell  served to remind young gentlemen going to offices, and boys going to  school, that the hour of their servitude was near. And Dick Bewery,  without a word, bolted half his coffee, snatched up his book, grabbed  at a cap which lay with more books on a chair close by, and vanished  through the open window. The doctor laughed, laid aside his newspaper,  and handed his cup across the table.    \"I don't think you need bother yourself about Dick's ever being late,  Mary,\" he said. \"You are not quite aware of the power of legs that are  only seventeen years old. Dick could get to any given point in just  about one-fourth of the time that I could, for instance--moreover, he  has a cunning knowledge of every short cut in the city.\"    Mary Bewery took the empty cup and began to refill it.    \"I don't like him to be late,\" she remarked. \"It's the beginning of bad  habits.\"    \"Oh, well!\" said Ransford indulgently. \"He's pretty free from anything  of that sort, you know. I haven't even suspected him of smoking, yet.\"    \"That's because he thinks smoking would stop his growth and interfere  with his cricket,\" answered Mary. \"He would smoke if it weren't for  that.\"    \"That's giving him high praise, then,\" said Ransford. \"You couldn't  give him higher! Know how to repress his inclinations. An excellent  thing--and most unusual, I fancy. Most people--don't!\"    He took his refilled cup, rose from the table, and opened a box of  cigarettes which stood on the mantelpiece. And the girl, instead of  picking up her letter again, glanced at him a little doubtfully.    \"That reminds me of--of something I wanted to say to you,\" she said.  \"You're quite right about people not repressing their inclinations. I--I  wish some people would!\"    Ransford turned quickly from the hearth and gave her a sharp look,  beneath which her colour heightened. Her eyes shifted their gaze away to  her letter, and she picked it up and began to fold it nervously. And at  that Ransford rapped out a name, putting a quick suggestion of meaning  inquiry into his voice.    \"Bryce?\" he asked.    The girl nodded her face showing distinct annoyance and dislike. Before  saying more, Ransford lighted a cigarette.    \"Been at it again?\" he said at last. \"Since last time?\"    \"Twice,\" she answered. \"I didn't like to tell you--I've hated to bother  you about it. But--what am I to do? I dislike him intensely--I can't  tell why, but it's there, and nothing could ever alter the feeling.  And though I told him--before--that it was useless--he mentioned it  again--yesterday--at Mrs. Folliot's garden-party.\"    \"Confound his impudence!\" growled Ransford. \"Oh, well!--I'll have to  settle with him myself. It's useless trifling with anything like that. I  gave him a quiet hint before. And since he won't take it--all right!\"    \"But--what shall you do?\" she asked anxiously. \"Not--send him away?\"    \"If he's any decency about him, he'll go--after what I say to him,\"  answered Ransford. \"Don't you trouble yourself about it--I'm not at all  keen about him. He's a clever enough fellow, and a good assistant, but I  don't like him, personally--never did.\"    \"I don't want to think that anything that I say should lose him his  situation--or whatever you call it,\" she remarked slowly. \"That would  seem--\"    \"No need to bother,\" interrupted Ransford. \"He'll get another in two  minutes--so to speak. Anyway, we can't have this going on. The fellow  must be an ass! When I was young--\"    He stopped short at that, and turning away,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#1)"],[1,"ON WHEELS    BY    CHRISTOPHER MORLEY      To H.B.F. and H.F.M.  \"Trusty, dusky, vivid, true\"      A LETTER TO  David Grayson, Esq.  OF HEMPFIELD, U.S.A.      MY DEAR SIR,    Although my name appears on the title page, the real author of this  book is Miss Helen McGill (now Mrs. Roger Mifflin), who told me the  story with her own inimitable vivacity. And on her behalf I want to  send to you these few words of acknowledgment.    Mrs. Mifflin, I need hardly say, is unskilled in the arts of  authorship: this is her first book, and I doubt whether she will  ever write another. She hardly realized, I think, how much her  story owes to your own delightful writings. There used to be a  well-thumbed copy of \"Adventures in Contentment\" on her table at the  Sabine Farm, and I have seen her pick it up, after a long day in  the kitchen, read it with chuckles, and say that the story of you  and Harriet reminded her of herself and Andrew. She used to mutter  something about \"Adventures in Discontentment\" and ask why Harriet's  side of the matter was never told? And so when her own adventure  came to pass, and she was urged to put it on paper, I think she  unconsciously adopted something of the manner and matter that you  have made properly yours.    Surely, sir, you will not disown so innocent a tribute! At any rate,  Miss Harriet Grayson, whose excellent qualities we have all so long  admired, will find in Mrs. Mifflin a kindred spirit.    Mrs. Mifflin would have said this for herself, with her characteristic  definiteness of speech, had she not been out of touch with her  publishers and foolscap paper. She and the Professor are on their  Parnassus, somewhere on the high roads, happily engrossed in the  most godly diversion known to man--selling books. And I venture  to think that there are no volumes they take more pleasure in  recommending than the wholesome and invigorating books which bear  your name.    Believe me, dear Mr. Grayson, with warm regards,    Faithfully yours,  CHRISTOPHER MORLEY.        CHAPTER ONE      I wonder if there isn't a lot of bunkum in higher education? I never  found that people who were learned in logarithms and other kinds of  poetry were any quicker in washing dishes or darning socks. I've  done a good deal of reading when I could, and I don't want to \"admit  impediments\" to the love of books, but I've also seen lots of good,  practical folk spoiled by too much fine print. Reading sonnets  always gives me hiccups, too.    I never expected to be an author! But I do think there are some  amusing things about the story of Andrew and myself and how books  broke up our placid life. When John Gutenberg, whose real name (so  the Professor says) was John Gooseflesh, borrowed that money to set  up his printing press he launched a lot of troubles on the world.    Andrew and I were wonderfully happy on the farm until he became an  author. If I could have foreseen all the bother his writings were  to cause us, I would certainly have burnt the first manuscript in  the kitchen stove.    Andrew McGill, the author of those books every one reads, is my  brother. In other words, I am his sister, ten years younger. Years  ago Andrew was a business man, but his health failed and, like so  many people in the story books, he fled to the country, or, as he  called it, to the bosom of Nature. He and I were the only ones left  in an unsuccessful family. I was slowly perishing as a conscientious  governess in the brownstone region of New York. He rescued me from  that and we bought a farm with our combined savings. We became real  farmers, up with the sun and to bed with the same. Andrew wore  overalls and a soft shirt and grew brown and tough. My hands got  red and blue with soapsuds and frost; I never saw a Redfern  advertisement from one year's end to another, and my kitchen was a  battlefield where I set my teeth and learned to love hard work.  Our literature was government agriculture reports, patent medicine  almanacs, seedsmen's booklets, and Sears Roebuck catalogues. We  subscribed to Farm and Fireside and read the serials aloud. Every  now and then, for real excitement, we read something stirring in the  Old Testament--that cheery book Jeremiah, for instance, of which  Andrew was very fond. The farm did actually prosper, after a while;  and Andrew used to hang over the pasture bars at sunset, and tell,  from the way his pipe burned, just what the weather would be the  next day.    As I have said, we were tremendously happy until Andrew got the  fatal idea of telling the world how happy we were. I am sorry to  have to admit he had always been rather a bookish man. In his  college days he had edited the students' magazine, and sometimes he  would get discontented with the Farm and Fireside serials and pull  down his bound volumes of the college paper. He would read me some  of his youthful poems and stories and mutter vaguely about writing  something himself some day. I was more concerned with sitting hens  than with sonnets and I'm bound to say I never took these threats  very seriously. I should have been more severe.    Then great-uncle Philip died, and his carload of books came to us.  He had been a college professor, and years ago when Andrew was a  boy Uncle Philip had been very fond of him--had, in fact, put him  through college. We were the only near relatives, and all those  books turned up one fine day. That was the beginning of the end,  if I had only known it. Andrew had the time of his life building  shelves all round our living-room; not content with that he turned  the old hen house into a study for himself, put in a stove, and used  to sit up there evenings after I had gone to bed. The first thing I  knew he called the place Sabine Farm (although it had been known for  years as Bog Hollow) because he thought it a literary thing to do.  He used to take a book along with him when he drove over to Redfield  for supplies; sometimes the wagon would be two hours late coming  home, with old Ben loafing along between the shafts and Andrew lost  in his book.    I didn't think much of all this, but I'm an easy-going woman and  as long as Andrew kept the farm going I had plenty to do on my own  hook. Hot bread and coffee, eggs and preserves for breakfast; soup  and hot meat, vegetables, dumplings, gravy, brown bread and white,  huckleberry pudding, chocolate cake and buttermilk for dinner;  muffins, tea, sausage rolls, blackberries and cream, and doughnuts  for supper--that's the kind of menu I had been preparing three times  a day for years. I hadn't any time to worry about what wasn't my  business.    And then one morning I caught Andrew doing up a big, flat parcel for  the postman. He looked so sheepish I just had to ask what it was.    \"I've written a book,\" said Andrew, and he showed me the title page--      PARADISE REGAINED    BY    ANDREW McGILL    Even then I wasn't much worried, because of course I knew no one  would print it. But Lord! a month or so later came a letter from a  publisher--accepting it! That's the letter Andrew keeps framed above  his desk. Just to show how such things sound I'll copy it here:      DECAMERON, JONES AND COMPANY    PUBLISHERS    UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK      January 13, 1907.    DEAR MR. McGILL:    We have read with singular pleasure your manuscript \"Paradise  Regained.\" There is no doubt in our minds that so spirited an  account of the joys of sane country living should meet with  popular approval, and, with the exception of a few revisions and  abbreviations, we would be glad to publish the book practically as  it stands. We would like to have it illustrated by Mr. Tortoni, some  of whose work you may have seen, and would be glad to know whether  he may call upon you in order to acquaint himself with the local  colour of your neighbourhood.    We would be glad to pay you a royalty of 10 percent upon the retail  price of the book, and we enclose duplicate contracts for your  signature in case this proves satisfactory to you.    Believe us, etc., etc.,    DECAMERON, JONES & CO.      I have since thought that \"Paradise Lost\" would have been a better  title for that book. It was published in the autumn of 1907, and  since that time our life has never been the same. By some mischance  the book became the success of the season; it was widely commended  as \"a gospel of health and sanity\" and Andrew received, in almost  every mail, offers from publishers and magazine editors who wanted  to get hold of his next book. It is almost incredible to what  stratagems publishers will descend to influence an author. Andrew  had written in \"Paradise Regained\" of the tramps who visit us, how  quaint and appealing some of them are (let me add, how dirty),  and how we never turn away any one who seems worthy. Would you  believe that, in the spring after the book was published, a  disreputable-looking vagabond with a knapsack, who turned up one  day, blarneyed Andrew about his book and stayed overnight, announced  himself at breakfast as a leading New York publisher? He had chosen  this ruse in order to make Andrew's acquaintance.    You can imagine that it didn't take long for Andrew to become  spoiled at this rate! The next year he suddenly disappeared, leaving  only a note on the kitchen table, and tramped all over the state for  six weeks collecting material for a new book. I had all I could do  to keep him from going to New York to talk to editors and people of  that sort. Envelopes of newspaper cuttings used to come to him, and  he would pore over them when he ought to have been ploughing corn.  Luckily the mail man comes along about the middle of the morning  when Andrew is out in the fields, so I used to look over the letters  before he saw them. After the second book (\"Happiness and Hayseed\"  it was called) was printed, letters from publishers got so thick  that I used to put them all in the stove before Andrew saw  them--except those from the Decameron Jones people, "]]]
