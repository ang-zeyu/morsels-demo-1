Thinks I to myself, as I overheard a person inquire of the servant at  the door, in an unmistakeable voice and tone, \"Is the Squire to hum?\"  that can be no one else than my old friend Sam Slick the Clockmaker.  But it could admit of no doubt when he proceeded, \"If he is, tell him  I am here.\"    \"Who shall I say, Sir?\"    The stranger paused a moment, and then said, \"It's such an everlastin'  long name, I don't think you can carry it all to wunst, and I don't  want it broke in two. Tell him it's a gentleman that calculates to  hold a protracted meeten here to-night. Come, don't stand starin'  there on the track, you might get run over. Don't you hear the engine  coming? Shunt off now.\"    \"Ah, my old friend,\" said I, advancing, and shaking him by the hand,  \"how are you?\"    \"As hearty as a buck,\" he replied, \"though I can't jist jump quite so  high now.\"    \"I knew you,\" I said, \"the moment I heard your voice, and if I had not  recognised that, I should have known your talk.\"    \"That's because I am a Yankee, Sir,\" he said, \"no two of us look  alike, or talk alike; but being free and enlightened citizens, we jist  talk as we please.\"    \"Ah, my good friend, you always please when you talk, and that is more  than can be said of most men.\"    \"And so will you,\" he replied, \"if you use soft sawder that way. Oh,  dear me! it seems but the other day that you laughed so at my theory  of soft sawder and human natur', don't it? They were pleasant days,  warn't they? I often think of them, and think of them with pleasure  too. As I was passing Halifax harbour, on my way hum in the 'Black  Hawk,' the wind fortunately came ahead, and thinks I to myself, I will  put in there, and pull foot1 for Windsor and see the Squire, give him  my Journal, and spend an hour or two with him once more. So here I am,  at least what is left of me, and dreadful glad I am to see you too;  but as it is about your dinner hour I will go and titivate up a bit,  and then we will have a dish of chat for desert, and cigars, to remind  us of by-gones, as we stroll through your shady walks here.\"      1 The Americans are not entitled to the credit or ridicule, whichever  people may be disposed to bestow upon them, for the extraordinary  phrases with which their conversation is occasionally embellished.  Some of them have good classical authority. That of \"pull-foot\" may be  traced to Euripides, [Greek text].      My old friend had worn well; he was still a wiry athletic man, and his  step as elastic and springy as ever. The constant exercise he had been  in the habit of taking had preserved his health and condition, and  these in their turn had enabled him to maintain his cheerfulness and  humour. The lines in his face were somewhat deeper, and a few  straggling grey hairs were the only traces of the hand of time. His  manner was much improved by his intercourse with the great world; but  his phraseology, in which he appeared to take both pride and pleasure,  was much the same as when I first knew him. So little indeed was he  changed, that I could scarcely believe so many years had elapsed since  we made our first tour together.    It was the most unexpected and agreeable visit. He enlivened the  conversation at dinner with anecdotes that were often too much for the  gravity of my servant, who once or twice left the room to avoid  explosive outbreaks of laughter. Among others, he told me the  following whimsical story.    \"When the 'Black Hawk' was at Causeau, we happened to have a queer  original sort of man, a Nova Scotia doctor, on board, who joined our  party at Ship Harbour, for the purpose of taking a cruise with us. Not  having anything above particular to do, we left the vessel and took  passage in a coaster for Prince Edward's Island, as my commission  required me to spend a day or two there, and inquire about the  fisheries. Well, although I don't trade now, I spekelate sometimes  when I see a right smart chance, and especially if there is fun in the  transaction. So, sais I, 'Doctor, I will play possum1 with these  folks, and take a rise out of them, that will astonish their weak  narves, I know, while I put several hundred dollars in my pocket at  the same time.' So I advertised that I would give four pounds ten  shillings for the largest Hackmetack knee in the island, four pounds  for the second, three pounds ten shillings for the third, and three  pounds for the fourth biggest one. I suppose, Squire, you know what a  ship's knee is, don't you? It is a crooked piece of timber, exactly  the shape of a man's leg when kneeling. It forms two sides of a  square, and makes a grand fastening for the side and deck beams of a  vessel.      1 The opossum, when chased by dogs, will often pretend to be dead, and  thus deceives his pursuers.      \"'What in the world do you want of only four of those knees?' said the  Doctor.    \"'Nothing,' said I, 'but to raise a laugh on these critters, and make  them pay real handsome for the joke.'    \"Well, every bushwhacker and forest ranger in the island thought he  knew where to find four enormous ones, and that he would go and get  them, and say nothing to nobody, and all that morning fixed for the  delivery they kept coming into the shipping place with them. People  couldn't think what under the light of the living sun was going on,  for it seemed as if every team in the province was at work, and all  the countrymen were running mad on junipers. Perhaps no livin' soul  ever see such a beautiful collection of ship-timber afore, and I am  sure never will again in a crow's age. The way these 'old oysters' (a  nick-name I gave the islanders, on account of their everlastin' beds  of this shell-fish) opened their mugs and gaped was a caution to dying  calves.    \"At the time appointed, there were eight hundred sticks on the ground,  the very best in the colony. Well, I went very gravely round and  selected the four largest, and paid for them cash down on the nail,  according to contract. The goneys seed their fix, but didn't know how  they got into it. They didn't think hard of me, for I advertised for  four sticks only, and I gave a very high price for them; but they did  think a little mean of themselves, that's a fact, for each man had but  four pieces, and they were too ridiculous large for the thunderin'  small vessels built on the island. They scratched their heads in a way  that was harrowing, even in a stubble field.    \"'My gracious,' sais I, 'hackmetacks, it seems to me, is as thick in  this country as blackberries in the Fall, after the robins have left  to go to sleep for the winter. Who on earth would have thought there  was so many here? Oh, children of Israel! What a lot there is, ain't  there? Why, the father of this island couldn't hold them all.'    \"'Father of this island,' sais they, 'who is he?'    \"'Why,' sais I, 'ain't this Prince Edward's?'    \"'Why, yes,' sais they, looking still more puzzled.    \"'Well,' sais I, 'in the middle of Halifax harbour is King George's  Island, and that must be the father of this.'    \"Well if they could see any wit in that speech, it is more than I  could, to save my soul alive; but it is the easiest thing in the world  to set a crowd off a tee-heeing. They can't help it, for it is  electrical. Go to the circus now, and you will hear a stupid joke of  the clown; well, you are determined you won't laugh, but somehow you  can't help it no how you can fix it, although you are mad with  yourself for doing so, and you just roar out and are as big a fool as  all the rest.    \"Well it made them laugh, and that was enough for me.    \"Sais I, 'the wust of it is, gentlemen, they are all so shocking  large, and there is no small ones among them; they can't be divided  into lots, still, as you seem to be disappointed, I will make you an  offer for them, cash down, all hard gold.' So I gave them a bid at a  very low figure, say half nothing, 'and,' sais I, 'I advise you not to  take it, they are worth much more, if a man only knows what to do with  them. Some of your traders, I make no manner of doubt, will give you  twice as much if you will only take your pay in goods, at four times  their value, and perhaps they mightent like your selling them to a  stranger, for they are all responsible government-men, and act  accordin' 'to the well understood wishes of the people.' I shall sail  in two hours, and you can let me know; but mind, I can only buy all or  none, for I shall have to hire a vessel to carry them. After all,'  sais I, 'perhaps we had better not trade, for,' taking out a handful  of sovereigns from my pocket, and jingling them, 'there is no two ways  about it; these little fellows are easier to carry by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#1)"],[1,"OR    VIRTUE REWARDED    By Samuel Richardson          PUBLISHERS' NOTE      Samuel Richardson, the first, in order of time, of the great English  novelists, was born in 1689 and died at London in 1761. He was a printer  by trade, and rose to be master of the Stationers' Company. That he also  became a novelist was due to his skill as a letter-writer, which brought  him, in his fiftieth year, a commission to write a volume of model  \"familiar letters\" as an aid to persons too illiterate to compose  their own. The notion of connecting these letters by a story which  had interested him suggested the plot of \"Pamela\" and determined its  epistolary form--a form which was retained in his later works.    This novel (published 1740) created an epoch in the history of English  fiction, and, with its successors, exerted a wide influence upon  Continental literature. It is appropriately included in a series which  is designed to form a group of studies of English life by the masters  of English fiction. For it marked the transition from the novel of  adventure to the novel of character--from the narration of entertaining  events to the study of men and of manners, of motives and of sentiments.  In it the romantic interest of the story (which is of the slightest) is  subordinated to the moral interest in the conduct of its characters in  the various situations in which they are placed. Upon this aspect of the  \"drama of human life\" Richardson cast a most observant, if not always  a penetrating glance. His works are an almost microscopically detailed  picture of English domestic life in the early part of the eighteenth  century.            PAMELA, or VIRTUE REWARDED          LETTER I      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I have great trouble, and some comfort, to acquaint you with. The  trouble is, that my good lady died of the illness I mentioned to you,  and left us all much grieved for the loss of her; for she was a dear  good lady, and kind to all us her servants. Much I feared, that as I  was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person, I should be quite  destitute again, and forced to return to you and my poor mother, who  have enough to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my lady's goodness  had put me to write and cast accounts, and made me a little expert at my  needle, and otherwise qualified above my degree, it was not every family  that could have found a place that your poor Pamela was fit for: but  God, whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch,  put it into my good lady's heart, on her death-bed, just an hour before  she expired, to recommend to my young master all her servants, one by  one; and when it came to my turn to be recommended, (for I was sobbing  and crying at her pillow) she could only say, My dear son!--and so broke  off a little; and then recovering--Remember my poor Pamela--And these  were some of her last words! O how my eyes run--Don't wonder to see the  paper so blotted.    Well, but God's will must be done!--And so comes the comfort, that I  shall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents!  For my master said, I will take care of you all, my good maidens; and  for you, Pamela, (and took me by the hand; yes, he took my hand before  them all,) for my dear mother's sake, I will be a friend to you, and you  shall take care of my linen. God bless him! and pray with me, my dear  father and mother, for a blessing upon him, for he has given mourning  and a year's wages to all my lady's servants; and I having no wages as  yet, my lady having said she should do for me as I deserved, ordered the  housekeeper to give me mourning with the rest; and gave me with his own  hand four golden guineas, and some silver, which were in my old lady's  pocket when she died; and said, if I was a good girl, and faithful and  diligent, he would be a friend to me, for his mother's sake. And so I  send you these four guineas for your comfort; for Providence will not  let me want: And so you may pay some old debt with part, and keep the  other part to comfort you both. If I get more, I am sure it is my duty,  and it shall be my care, to love and cherish you both; for you have  loved and cherished me, when I could do nothing for myself. I send them  by John, our footman, who goes your way: but he does not know what he  carries; because I seal them up in one of the little pill-boxes, which  my lady had, wrapt close in paper, that they mayn't chink; and be sure  don't open it before him.    I know, dear father and mother, I must give you both grief and pleasure;  and so I will only say, Pray for your Pamela; who will ever be    Your most dutiful DAUGHTER.    I have been scared out of my senses; for just now, as I was folding up  this letter in my late lady's dressing-room, in comes my young master!  Good sirs! how was I frightened! I went to hide the letter in my bosom;  and he, seeing me tremble, said, smiling, To whom have you been writing,  Pamela?--I said, in my confusion, Pray your honour forgive me!--Only to  my father and mother. He said, Well then, let me see how you are come on  in your writing! O how ashamed I was!--He took it, without saying more,  and read it quite through, and then gave it me again;--and I said, Pray  your honour forgive me!--Yet I know not for what: for he was always  dutiful to his parents; and why should he be angry that I was so to  mine? And indeed he was not angry; for he took me by the hand, and said,  You are a good girl, Pamela, to be kind to your aged father and mother.  I am not angry with you for writing such innocent matters as these:  though you ought to be wary what tales you send out of a family.--Be  faithful and diligent; and do as you should do, and I like you the  better for this. And then he said, Why, Pamela, you write a very pretty  hand, and spell tolerably too. I see my good mother's care in your  learning has not been thrown away upon you. She used to say you loved  reading; you may look into any of her books, to improve yourself, so you  take care of them. To be sure I did nothing but courtesy and cry,  and was all in confusion, at his goodness. Indeed he is the best of  gentlemen, I think! But I am making another long letter: So will only  add to it, that I shall ever be Your dutiful daughter, PAMELA ANDREWS.          LETTER II      [In answer to the preceding.]    DEAR PAMELA,    Your letter was indeed a great trouble, and some comfort, to me and your  poor mother. We are troubled, to be sure, for your good lady's death,  who took such care of you, and gave you learning, and, for three or  four years past, has always been giving you clothes and linen, and every  thing that a gentlewoman need not be ashamed to appear in. But our chief  trouble is, and indeed a very great one, for fear you should be brought  to anything dishonest or wicked, by being set so above yourself. Every  body talks how you have come on, and what a genteel girl you are; and  some say you are very pretty; and, indeed, six months since, when I saw  you last, I should have thought so myself, if you was not our child. But  what avails all this, if you are to be ruined and undone!--Indeed, my  dear Pamela, we begin to be in great fear for you; for what signify all  the riches in the world, with a bad conscience, and to be dishonest! We  are, 'tis true, very poor, and find it hard enough to live; though once,  as you know, it was better with us. But we would sooner live upon the  water, and, if possible, the clay of the ditches I contentedly dig, than  live better at the price of our child's ruin.    I hope the good 'squire has no design: but when he has given you so much  money, and speaks so kindly to you, and praises your coming on; and, oh,  that fatal word! that he would be kind to you, if you would do as you  should do, almost kills us with fears.    I have spoken to good old widow Mumford about it, who, you know, has  formerly lived in good families; and she puts us in some comfort; for  she says it is not unusual, when a lady dies, to give what she has about  her person to her waiting-maid, and to such as sit up with her in her  illness. But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you? Why should  he take such a poor girl as you by the hand, as your letter says he has  done twice? Why should he stoop to read your letter to us; and commend  your writing and spelling? And why should he give you leave to read his  mother's books?--Indeed, indeed, my dearest child, our hearts ache for  you; and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness, so taken with  his kind expressions, (which, truly, are very great favours, if he  means well) that we fear--yes, my dear child, we fear--you should be too  grateful,--and reward him with that jewel, your virtue, which no riches,  nor favour, nor any thing in this life, can make up to you.    I, too, have written a long letter, but will say one thing more; and  that is, that, in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes, we have  trusted in God's goodness, and been honest, and doubt not to be happy  hereafter, if we continue to be good, though our lot is hard here; but  the loss of our dear child's virtue would be a grief that we could not  bear, and would bring our grey hairs to the grave at once.    If, then, you love us, if you wish for God's blessing, and your own  future happiness, we both charge you to stand upon your guard: and,  if you find the least attempt made upon your virtue, be sure you leave  every thing behind you, and come away to us; for we had rather see you  all covered with rags, and even follow you to the churchyard, than  have it said, a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her  virtue.    We accept kindly your dutiful present; but, till we are out of pain,  cannot make use of it, for fear we should partake of the price of our  poor daughter's shame: so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch,  over the window, for a while, lest we should be robbed.
