A HISTORY OF FRENCH EXPLORATIONS  AND PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA    BY    ERNEST SCOTT.      WITH EIGHT ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPS.      SECOND EDITION.    METHUEN & CO., LTD.  36 ESSEX STREET W.C.  LONDON.    FIRST PUBLISHED JULY 7TH, 1910.  SECOND EDITION 1911.        PREFACE.    The main object of this book is to exhibit the facts relative to the  expedition despatched to Australia by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800 to 1804,  and to consider certain opinions which have been for many years current  regarding its purpose.    Until about five years ago the writer accepted without doubt the  conclusions presented by leading authorities. One has to do that in  regard to the vast mass of historical material, because, obviously,  however much disposed one may be to form one's opinions on tested facts  apart from the writings of historians, several lifetimes would not be  sufficient for a man to inquire for himself as to the truth of a bare  fraction of the conclusions with which research is concerned.    But it so happened that the writer was interested, for other reasons than  those disclosed in the following pages, in ascertaining exactly what was  done by the expedition commanded by Captain Nicolas Baudin on the coasts  which were labelled Terre Napoleon. On scrutinising the facts somewhat  narrowly, he was surprised to find that opinions accepted with  unquestioning faith began to crumble away for lack of evidence to support  them.    So much is stated by way of showing that the book has not been written to  prove a conclusion formulated a priori, but with a sincere desire that  the truth about the matter should be known. We read much in modern books  devoted to the era of the Corsican about \"the Napoleonic legend.\" There  seems to be, just here, a little sporadic Napoleonic legend, to which  vitality has been given from quarters whence have come some heavy blows  at the larger one.    The plan adopted has been, after a preliminary sketch of the colonial  situation of Great Britain and France in the period under review, to  bring upon the scene--the Terre Napoleon coasts--the discovery ship  Investigator, despatched by the British Government at about the same time  as Napoleon's vessels were engaged upon their task, and to describe the  meeting of the two captains, Flinders and Baudin, in Encounter Bay. Next,  the coasts denominated Terre Napoleon are traversed, and an estimate is  made of the original work done by Baudin, and of the serious omissions  for which he was to blame. A second part of the subject is then entered  upon. The origin of the expedition is traced, and the ships are carefully  followed throughout their voyage, with a view to elicit whether there  was, as alleged, a political purpose apart from the scientific work for  which the enterprise was undertaken at the instance of the Institute of  France.    The two main points which the book handles are: (1) whether Napoleon's  object was to acquire territory in Australia and to found \"a second  fatherland\" for the French there; and (2) whether it is true, as so often  asserted, that the French plagiarised Flinders' charts for the purpose of  constructing their own. On both these points conclusions are reached  which are at variance with those commonly presented; but the evidence is  placed before the reader with sufficient amplitude to enable him to  arrive at a fair opinion on the facts, which, the author believes, are  faithfully stated.    A third point of some importance, and which is believed to be quite new,  relates to the representation of Port Phillip on the Terre Napoleon maps.  It is a curious fact that, much as has been written on the early history  of Australia, no writer, so far as the author is aware, has observed the  marked conflict of evidence between Captain Baudin and his own officers  as to that port having been seen by their discovery ships, and as to how  the representation of it on the French maps got there. Inasmuch as Port  Phillip is the most important harbour in the territory which was called  Terre Napoleon, the matter is peculiarly interesting. Yet, although the  author has consulted more than a score of volumes in which the expedition  is mentioned, or its work dealt with at some length, not one of the  writers has pointed out this sharp contradiction in testimony, still less  attempted to account for it. It is to be feared that in the writing of  Australian, as of much other history, there has been on the part of  authors a considerable amount of \"taking in each other's washing.\"    The table of comparative chronology is designed to enable the reader to  see at a glance the dates of the occurrences described in the book, side  by side with those of important events in the world at large. It is  always an advantage, when studying a particular piece of history, to have  in mind other happenings of real consequence pertaining to the period  under review. Such a table should remind us of what Freeman spoke of as  the \"unity and indivisibility of history,\" if it does no more.      CONTENTS.      INTRODUCTION.

Jesus College, Oxford; Author of    THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD,    TIBET'S GREAT YOGI MILAREPA,    TIBETAN YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES, etc.    The value of Yogananda's AUTOBIOGRAPHYis greatly enhanced by the  fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men  of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner,  but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book ABOUT  yogis BY a yogi.  As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary  lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance  both timely and timeless.  To its illustrious author, whom I have  had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every  reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document  is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu  mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be  published in the West.    It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose  life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of  the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my TIBETAN  YOGA AND SECRET DOCTRINES. {FN1-1} It was at Puri, in Orissa, on  the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the  head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly  occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples.  He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the  United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and  questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those  in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom  he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to  the West.    Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,  and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously  accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own  community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall  his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored  garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the  entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long  and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly  firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had  chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither  multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of  India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath,  \"Lord of the World.\" It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his  mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of  being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried  to a triumphant completion.  I am glad, indeed, to be able to record  this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.  Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly  and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda,  his disciple, has now described for the ages.  W. Y.

PARAMHANSA YOGANANDA  OCTOBER 28, 1945  ENCINITAS, CALIFORNIA        CHAPTER: 1    MY PARENTS AND EARLY LIFE    The characteristic features of Indian culture have long been  a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru  {FN1-2} relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage whose  beautiful life was chiseled for the ages. He was one of the great  masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in every  generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate of  Babylon and Egypt.    I find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of  a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant  life, a yogi {FN1-3} amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of  the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse  of the future.    The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind.  I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express  myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized  my bodily impotence. My strong emotional life took silent form as  words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues,  my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali  syllables of my people.  The beguiling scope of an infant's mind!  adultly considered limited to toys and toes.    Psychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many  obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment  at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother's  caresses, and "]]]
