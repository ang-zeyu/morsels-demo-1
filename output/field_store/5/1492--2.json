[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#1)"],[1,"is a preliminary edition.  The final first edition should be on  file around midnight, October 31, 1993.    As usual, the margination in these reports may be rough, and another  edition should appear, somewhat neater in appearance, as a Gutenberg  volunteer will probably start work on this shortly.    This file has been edited in such a manner as to delete redundancies  [some, not all] and extra spaces [some, not all], enough that a file  from Project Gutenberg should be enough smaller that storarge/search  requirements should be reduced by 15 to 20%.    To search for information on a specific country from the list below,  search for *country:  *Afganistan, for example.

Czechoslovakia has  been superseded by the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Eritrea gained independence  from Ethiopia. The name of the Ivory Coast has been changed to Cote d'Ivoire and  the Vatican City became the Holy See. New entries include Location, Map  references, Abbreviation (often substituted for the country name), and Digraph  (two-letter country code). Names is a new entry which includes long and short  forms of both conventional and local names of countries as well as any former  names. Most diacritical marks have been omitted. The electronic files used to  produce the Factbook have been restructured into a database. As a result, the  formats of some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes  will occur in the 1994 Factbook. Irrigated land is a new entry with the data  separate from the Land use entry. The Disputes entry is now International  disputes. The GNP/GDP entry was renamed National Product and the per capita and  real growth rate data placed in separate entries. Similar changes were made in  the Population and Diplomatic Representation entries.

Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by  BGN are noted.    Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all  surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding  inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on  total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of  the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2,  69 miles 2) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles 2,146 acres).    Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000  population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.    Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1993 was  used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1  July 1993, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1993. Major  political events have been updated through June 1993.    Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000  population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.    Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code'' that precisely identifies  every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the  digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element  promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)  10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (US Department of Commerce) and  maintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of State). The digraph  is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection,  processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful  for interchanging data between databases.    Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 180  nations. The US has diplomatic relations with 174 of the 182 UN members  (excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status in the UN  is unclear)--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/871"],[0,"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes (#1)"],[1,"GOLDEN SAYINGS OF EPICTETUS      Translated and Arranged by Hastings Crossley          I    Are these the only works of Providence within us? What words suffice to  praise or set them forth? Had we but understanding, should we ever cease  hymning and blessing the Divine Power, both openly and in secret, and  telling of His gracious gifts? Whether digging or ploughing or eating,  should we not sing the hymn to God:--    Great is God, for that He hath given us such instruments to till  the ground withal: Great is God, for that He hath given us hands and  the power of swallowing and digesting; of unconsciously growing and  breathing while we sleep!    Thus should we ever have sung; yea and this, the grandest and divinest  hymn of all:--    Great is God, for that He hath given us a mind to apprehend these  things, and duly to use them!    What then! seeing that most of you are blinded, should there not be some  one to fill this place, and sing the hymn to God on behalf of all  men? What else can I that am old and lame do but sing to God? Were I  a nightingale, I should do after the manner of a nightingale. Were I  a swan, I should do after the manner of a swan. But now, since I am a  reasonable being, I must sing to God: that is my work: I do it, nor will  I desert this my post, as long as it is granted me to hold it; and upon  you too I call to join in this self-same hymn.          II    How then do men act? As though one returning to his country who had  sojourned for the night in a fair inn, should be so captivated thereby  as to take up his abode there.    \"Friend, thou hast forgotten thine intention! This was not thy  destination, but only lay on the way thither.\"    \"Nay, but it is a proper place.\"    \"And how many more of the sort there may be; only to pass through  upon thy way! Thy purpose was to return to thy country; to relieve thy  kinsmen's fears for thee; thyself to discharge the duties of a citizen;  to marry a wife, to beget offspring, and to fill the appointed round of  office. Thou didst not come to choose out what places are most pleasant;  but rather to return to that wherein thou wast born and where wert  appointed to be a citizen.\"          III    Try to enjoy the great festival of life with other men.          IV    But I have one whom I must please, to whom I must be subject, whom I  must obey:--God, and those who come next to Him. He hath entrusted me  with myself: He hath made my will subject to myself alone and given me  rules for the right use thereof.          V    Rufus used to say, If you have leisure to praise me, what I say is  naught. In truth he spoke in such wise, that each of us who sat there,  though that some one had accused him to Rufus:--so surely did he lay his  finger on the very deeds we did: so surely display the faults of each  before his very eyes.          VI    But what saith God?--\"Had it been possible, Epictetus, I would have made  both that body of thine and thy possessions free and unimpeded, but as  it is, be not deceived:--it is not thine own; it is but finely tempered  clay. Since then this I could not do, I have given thee a portion of  Myself, in the power of desiring and declining and of pursuing and  avoiding, and in a word the power of dealing with the things of sense.  And if thou neglect not this, but place all that thou hast therein, thou  shalt never be let or hindered; thou shalt never lament; thou shalt  not blame or flatter any. What then? Seemth this to thee a little  thing?\"--God forbid!--\"Be content then therewith!\"    And so I pray the Gods.          VII    What saith Antisthenes? Hast thou never heard?--    It is a kingly thing, O Cyrus, to do well and to be evil spoken of.          VIII    \"Aye, but to debase myself thus were unworthy of me.\"    \"That,\" said Epictetus, \"is for you to consider, not for me. You know  yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will  sell yourself. For men sell themselves at various prices. This was why,  when Florus was deliberating whether he should appear at Nero's shows,  taking part in the performance himself, Agrippinus replied, 'But why  do not you appear?' he answered, 'Because I do not even consider the  question.' For the man who has once stooped to consider such questions,  and to reckon up the value of external things, is not far from  forgetting what manner of man he is. Why, what is it that you ask me?  Is death preferable, or life? I reply, Life. Pain or pleasure? I reply,  Pleasure.\"    \"Well, but if I do not act, I shall lose my head.\"    \"Then go and act! But for my part I will not act.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because you think yourself but one among the many threads which make  up the texture of the doublet. You should aim at being like men in  general--just as your thread has no ambition either to be anything  distinguished compared with the other threads. But I desire to be the  purple--that small and shining part which makes the rest seem fair and  beautiful. Why then do you bid me become even as the multitude? Then  were I no longer the purple.\"          IX    If a man could be throughly penetrated, as he ought, with this thought,  that we are all in an especial manner sprung from God, and that God  is the Father of men as well as of Gods, full surely he would never  conceive aught ignoble or base of himself. Whereas if Caesar were to  adopt you, your haughty looks would be intolerable; will you not be  elated at knowing that you are the son of God? Now however it is not  so with us: but seeing that in our birth these two things are  commingled--the body which we share with the animals, and the Reason and  Thought which we share with the Gods, many decline towards this unhappy  kinship with the dead, few rise to the blessed kinship with the Divine.  Since then every one must deal with each thing according to the view  which he forms about it, those few who hold that they are born for  fidelity, modesty, and unerring sureness in dealing with the things  of sense, never conceive aught base or ignoble of themselves: but the  multitude the contrary. Why, what am I?--A wretched human creature; with  this miserable flesh of mine. Miserable indeed! but you have something  better than that paltry flesh of yours. Why then cling to the one, and  neglect the other?          X    Thou art but a poor soul laden with a lifeless body.          XI    The other day I had an iron lamp placed beside my household gods. I  heard a noise at the door and on hastening down found my lamp carried  off. I reflected that the culprit was in no very strange case.  \"Tomorrow, my friend,\" I said, \"you will find an earthenware lamp; for a  man can only lose what he has.\"          XII    The reason why I lost my lamp was that the thief was superior to me in  vigilance. He paid however this price for the lamp, that in exchange  for it he consented to become a thief: in exchange for it, to become  faithless.          XIII    But God hath introduced Man to be a spectator of Himself and of His  works; and not a spectator only, but also an interpreter of them.  Wherefore it is a shame for man to begin and to leave off where the  brutes do. Rather he should begin there, and leave off where Nature  leaves off in us: and that is at contemplation, and understanding, and a  manner of life that is in harmony with herself.    See then that ye die not without being spectators of these things.          XIV    You journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias; and each of you holds  it a misfortune not to have beheld these things before you die. Whereas  when there is no need even to take a journey, but you are on the spot,  with the works before you, have you no care to contemplate and study  these?    Will you not then perceive either who you are or unto what end you were  born: or for what purpose the power of contemplation has been bestowed  on you?    \"Well, but in life there are some things disagreeable and hard to bear.\"    And are there none at Olympia? Are you not scorched by the heat? Are you  not cramped for room? Have you not to bathe with discomfort? Are you not  drenched when it rains? Have you not to endure the clamor and shouting  and such annoyances as these? Well, I suppose you set all this over  against the splendour of the spectacle and bear it patiently. What then?  have you not received greatness of heart, received courage, received  fortitude? What care I, if I am great of heart, for aught that can come  to pass? What shall cast me down or disturb me? What shall seem painful?  Shall I not use the power to the end for which I received it, instead of  moaning and wailing over what comes to pass?          XV    If what philosophers say of the kinship of God and Man be true, what  remains for men to do but as Socrates did:--never, when asked one's  country, to answer, \"I am an Athenian or a Corinthian,\" but \"I am a  citizen of the world.\"          XVI    He that hath grasped the administration of the World, who hath learned  that this Community, which consists of God and men, is the foremost and  mightiest and most comprehensive of all:--that from God have descended  the germs of life, not to my father only and father's father, but to all  things that are born and grow upon the earth, and in an especial manner  to those endowed with Reason (for those only are by their nature fitted  to hold communion with God, being by means of Reason conjoined with  Him)--why should not such an one call himself a citizen of the world?  Why not a son of God? Why should he fear aught that comes to pass among  men? Shall kinship with Caesar, or any other of the great at Rome, be  enough to hedge men around with safety and consideration, without a  thought of apprehension: while to have God for our Maker, and Father,  and Kinsman, shall not this set us free from sorrows and fears?          XVII    I do not think that an old fellow like me need have been sitting here  to try and prevent your entertaining abject"]]]
