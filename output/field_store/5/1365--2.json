GENTLE SISTER SOUTH WIND ARRIVES      \"Good news, good news for every one, above or down below, For Master  Winsome Bluebird's come to whistle off the snow!\"    All the Green Meadows and all the Green Forest had heard the news. Peter  Rabbit had seen to that. And just as soon as each of the little meadow  and forest folks heard it, he hurried out to listen for himself and  make sure that it was true. And each, when he heard that sweet voice of  Winsome Bluebird, had kicked up his heels and shouted \"Hurrah!\"    You see they all knew that Winsome Bluebird never is very far ahead of  gentle Sister South Wind, and that when she arrives, blustering, rough  Brother North Wind is already on his way back to the cold, cold land  where the ice never melts.    Of course Winsome Bluebird doesn't really whistle off the snow, but  after he comes, the snow disappears so fast that it seems as if he did.  It is surprising what a difference a little good news makes. Of course  nothing had really changed that first day when Winsome Bluebird's  whistle was heard on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest, but it  seemed as if everything had changed. And it was all because that sweet  whistle was a promise, a promise that every one knew would come true.  And so there was joy in all the hearts on the Green Meadows and in the  Green Forest. Even grim old Granny Fox felt it, and as for Reddy Fox,  why, Reddy even shouted good-naturedly to Peter Rabbit and hoped he was  feeling well.    And then gentle Sister South Wind arrived. She came in the night, and in  the morning there she was, hard at work making the Green Meadows and the  Green Forest ready for Mistress Spring. She broke the icy bands that had  bound the Smiling Pool and the Laughing Brook so long; and the Smiling  Pool began to smile once more, and the Laughing Brook to gurgle and then  to laugh and finally to sing merrily.    She touched the little banks of snow that remained, and straightway  they melted and disappeared. She kissed the eight babies of Unc' Billy  Possum, and they kicked off the bedclothes under which old Mrs. Possum  had tucked them and scrambled out of the big hollow tree to play.    She peeped in at the door of Johnny Chuck and called softly, and Johnny  Chuck awoke from his long sleep and yawned and began to think about  getting up. She knocked at the door of Digger the Badger, and Digger  awoke. She tickled the nose of Striped Chipmunk, who was about half  awake, and Striped Chipmunk sneezed and then he hopped out of bed  and hurried up to his doorway to shout good morning after her, as she  hurried over to see if Bobby Coon was still sleeping.    Peter Rabbit followed her about. He couldn't understand it at all. Peter  had smiled to himself when he heard how softly she had called at the  doorway of Johnny Chuck's house, for many and many a time during the  long winter Peter had stopped at Johnny Chuck's house and shouted down  the long hall at the top of his voice without once waking Johnny Chuck.  Now Peter nearly tumbled over with surprise, as he heard Johnny Chuck  yawn at the first low call of gentle Sister South Wind.    \"How does she do it? I don't understand it at all,\" said Peter, as he  scratched his long left ear with his long left hind leg.    Gentle Sister South Wind smiled at Peter. \"There are a lot of things in  this world that you will never understand, Peter Rabbit. You will just  have to believe them without understanding them and be content to know  that they are so,\" she said, and hurried over to the Green Forest to  tell Unc' Billy Possum that his old friend, Ol' Mistah Buzzard, was on  his way up from ol' Virginny.          II. JOHNNY CHUCK RECEIVES CALLERS      The morning after gentle Sister South Wind arrived on the Green Meadows,  Peter Rabbit came hopping and skipping down the Lone Little Path from  the Green Forest. Peter was happy. He didn't know why. He just was  happy. It was in the air. Everybody else seemed happy, too. Peter had  to stop every few minutes just to kick up his heels and try to jump over  his own shadow. He had felt just that way ever since gentle Sister South  Wind arrived.        \"I simply have to kick and dance!       I cannot help but gaily prance!       Somehow I feel it in my toes       Whenever gentle South Wind blows.\"    So sang Peter Rabbit as he hopped and skipped down the Lone Little Path.  Suddenly he stopped right in the middle of the verse. He sat up very  straight and stared down at Johnny Chuck's house. Some one was sitting  on Johnny Chuck's door-step. It looked like Johnny Chuck. No, it looked  like the shadow of Johnny Chuck. Peter rubbed his eyes and looked again.  Then he hurried as fast as he could, lipperty-lipperty-lip. The nearer  he got, the less like Johnny Chuck looked the one sitting on Johnny  Chuck's door-step. Johnny Chuck had gone to sleep round and fat and  roly-poly, so fat he could hardly waddle. This fellow was thin, even  thinner than Peter Rabbit himself. He waved a thin hand to Peter.    \"Hello, Peter Rabbit! I told you that I would see you in the spring. How  did you stand the long winter?\"    That certainly was Johnny Chuck's voice. Peter was so delighted that in  his hurry he fell over his own feet. \"Is it really and truly you, Johnny  Chuck?\" he cried.    \"Of course it's me; who did you think it was?\" replied Johnny Chuck  rather crossly, for Peter was staring at him as if he had never seen him  before.    \"I--I--I didn't know,\" confessed Peter Rabbit. \"I thought it was you and  I thought it wasn't you. What have you been doing to yourself, Johnny  Chuck? Your coat looks three sizes too big for you, and when I last saw  you it didn't look big enough.\" Peter hopped all around Johnny Chuck,  looking at him as if he didn't believe his own eyes.    {Illustration: \"Is it really and truly you, Johnny Chuck?\" he cried.}    \"Oh, Johnny's all right. He's just been living on his own fat,\" said  another voice. It was Jimmy Skunk who had spoken, and he now stood  holding out his hand to Johnny Chuck and grinning good-naturedly. He had  come up without either of the others seeing him.    Peter's big eyes opened wider than ever. \"Do you mean to say that he has  been eating his own fat?\" he gasped.    Johnny Chuck and Jimmy Skunk both laughed. \"No,\" said Jimmy Skunk, \"he  didn't eat it, but he lived on it just the same while he was asleep all  winter. Don't you see he hasn't got a particle of fat on him now?\"    \"But how could he live on it, if he didn't eat it?\" asked Peter, staring  at Johnny Chuck as if he had never seen him before.    Jimmy Skunk shrugged his shoulders. \"Don't ask me. That is one of Old  Mother Nature's secrets; you'll have to ask her,\" he replied.    \"And don't ask me,\" said Johnny Chuck, \"for I've been asleep all the  time. My, but I'm hungry!\"    \"So am I!\" said another voice. There was Reddy Fox grinning at them.  Johnny Chuck dove into the doorway of his house with Peter Rabbit at his  heels, for there was nowhere else to go. Jimmy Skunk just stood still  and chuckled. He knew that Reddy Fox didn't dare touch him.          III. THE SINGERS OF THE SMILING POOL      Mistress Spring was making everybody happy on the Green Meadows and in  the Green Forest and around the Smiling Pool. With her gentle fingers  she wakened one by one all the little sleepers who had spent the long  winter dreaming of warm summer days and not knowing anything at all of  rough, blustering Brother North Wind or Jack Frost. As they wakened,  many began to sing for joy. But the clearest, loudest singers of all  lived in the Smiling Pool.    It was a long time before Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck knew where they  lived. Every night just before going to bed, Johnny Chuck would sit on  his door-step just to listen, and as he listened somehow he felt better  and happier; and he always had pleasant dreams after listening to the  sweet singers of the Smiling Pool. Even after he had curled himself up  for the night deep down in his snug bedroom, he could hear those sweet  voices, and whenever he waked up in the night he would hear them.        \"Spring! Spring! Spring! Spring!       Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!       So gentle, so loving, so sweet and so fair!       Oh, who can be cross when there's love in the air?       Be happy! Be joyful!

Recognising this fully, and feeling quite incompetent to write such  a masterpiece, I have asked several literary friends to write one  for me, but they have kindly but firmly declined, stating that it is  impossible satisfactorily to apologise for my liberties with Lindley  Murray and the Queen's English.  I am therefore left to make a  feeble apology for this book myself, and all I can personally say is  that it would have been much worse than it is had it not been for  Dr. Henry Guillemard, who has not edited it, or of course the whole  affair would have been better, but who has most kindly gone through  the proof sheets, lassoing prepositions which were straying outside  their sentence stockade, taking my eye off the water cask and fixing  it on the scenery where I meant it to be, saying firmly in pencil on  margins \"No you don't,\" when I was committing some more than usually  heinous literary crime, and so on.  In cases where his activities in  these things may seem to the reader to have been wanting, I beg to  state that they really were not.  It is I who have declined to  ascend to a higher level of lucidity and correctness of diction than  I am fitted for.  I cannot forbear from mentioning my gratitude to  Mr. George Macmillan for his patience and kindness with me,--a mere  jungle of information on West Africa.  Whether you my reader will  share my gratitude is, I fear, doubtful, for if it had not been for  him I should never have attempted to write a book at all, and in  order to excuse his having induced me to try I beg to state that I  have written only on things that I know from personal experience and  very careful observation.  I have never accepted an explanation of a  native custom from one person alone, nor have I set down things as  being prevalent customs from having seen a single instance.  I have  endeavoured to give you an honest account of the general state and  manner of life in Lower Guinea and some description of the various  types of country there.  In reading this section you must make  allowances for my love of this sort of country, with its great  forests and rivers and its animistic-minded inhabitants, and for my  ability to be more comfortable there than in England.  Your superior  culture-instincts may militate against your enjoying West Africa,  but if you go there you will find things as I have said.    January, 1897.        PREFACE TO THE ABRIDGED EDITION OF TRAVELS IN WEST AFRICA.        When on my return to England from my second sojourn in West Africa,  I discovered, to my alarm, that I was, by a freak of fate, the sea-  serpent of the season, I published, in order to escape from this  reputation, a very condensed, much abridged version of my  experiences in Lower Guinea; and I thought that I need never explain  about myself or Lower Guinea again.  This was one of my errors.  I  have been explaining ever since; and, though not reconciled to so  doing, I am more or less resigned to it, because it gives me  pleasure to see that English people can take an interest in that  land they have neglected.  Nevertheless, it was a shock to me when  the publishers said more explanation was required.  I am thankful to  say the explanation they required was merely on what plan the  abridgment of my first account had been made.  I can manage that  explanation easily.  It has been done by removing from it certain  sections whole, and leaving the rest very much as it first stood.  Of course it would have been better if I had totally reformed and  rewritten the book in pellucid English; but that is beyond me, and I  feel at any rate this book must be better than it was, for there is  less of it; and I dimly hope critics will now see that there is a  saving grace in disconnectedness, for owing to that disconnectedness  whole chapters have come out without leaving holes.    As for the part that is left in, I have already apologised for its  form, and I cannot help it, for Lower Guinea is like what I have  said it is.  No one who knows it has sent home contradictions of my  description of it, or its natives, or their manners or customs, and  they have had by now ample time and opportunity.  The only  complaints I have had regarding my account from my fellow West  Coasters have been that I might have said more.  I trust my  forbearance will send a thrill of gratitude through readers of the  736-page edition.    There is, however, one section that I reprint, regarding which I  must say a few words.  It is that on the trade and labour problem in  West Africa, particularly the opinion therein expressed regarding  the liquor traffic.  This part has brought down on me much criticism  from the Missionary Societies and their friends; and I beg  gratefully to acknowledge the honourable fairness with which the  controversy has been carried on by the great Wesleyan Methodist  Mission to the Gold Coast and the Baptist Mission to the Congo.  It  has not ended in our agreement on this point, but it has raised my  esteem of Missionary Societies considerably; and anyone interested  in this matter I beg to refer to the Baptist Magazine for October,  1897.  Therein will be found my answer, and the comments on it by a  competent missionary authority; for the rest of this matter I beg  all readers of this book to bear in mind that I confine myself to  speaking only of the bit of Africa I know--West Africa.  During this  past summer I attended a meeting at which Sir George Taubman Goldie  spoke, and was much struck with the truth of what he said on the  difference of different African regions.  He divided Africa into  three zones:  firstly, that region where white races could colonise  in the true sense of the word, and form a great native-born white  population, namely, the region of the Cape; secondly, a region where  the white race could colonise, but to a less extent--an extent  analogous to that in India--namely, the highlands of Central East  Africa and parts of Northern Africa; thirdly, a region where the  white races cannot colonise in a true sense of the word, namely, the  West African region, and in those regions he pointed out one of the  main elements of prosperity and advance is the native African  population.  I am quoting his words from memory, possibly  imperfectly; but there is very little reliable printed matter to go  on when dealing with Sir George Taubman Goldie, which is regrettable  because he himself is an experienced and reliable authority.  I am  however quite convinced that these aforesaid distinct regions are  regions that the practical politician dealing with Africa must  recognise, and keep constantly in mind when attempting to solve the  many difficulties that that great continent presents, and sincerely  hope every reader of this work will remember that I am speaking of  that last zone, the zone wherein white races cannot colonise in a  true sense of the word, but which is nevertheless a vitally  important region to a great manufacturing country like England, for  therein are vast undeveloped markets wherein she can sell her  manufactured goods and purchase raw material for her manufactures at  a reasonable rate.    Having a rooted, natural, feminine hatred for politics I have no  inclination to become diffuse on them, as I have on the errors of  other people's cooking or ideas on decoration.  I know I am held to  be too partial to France in West Africa; too fond of pointing out  her brilliant achievements there, too fond of saying the native is  as happy, and possibly happier, under her rule than under ours; and  also that I am given to a great admiration for Germans; but this is  just like any common-sense Englishwoman.  Of course I am devoted to  my own John; but still Monsieur is brave, bright, and fascinating;  Mein Herr is possessed of courage and commercial ability in the  highest degree, and, besides, he takes such a lot of trouble to know  the real truth about things, and tells them to you so calmly and  carefully--and our own John--well, of course, he is everything  that's good and great, but he makes a shocking fool of himself at  times, particularly in West Africa.    I should enjoy holding what one of my justly irritated expurgators  used to call one of my little thanksgiving services here, but I will  not; for, after all, it would be impossible for me to satisfactorily  thank those people who, since my publication of this book, have  given me help and information on the subject of West Africa.  Chief  amongst them have been Mr. A. L. Jones, Sir. R. B. N. Walker, Mr.  Irvine, and Mr. John Holt.  I have not added "]]]
