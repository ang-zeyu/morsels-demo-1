Wodehouse    1922            DEDICATION    TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF  JOHN HENRIE AND PAT ROGIE  WHO AT EDINBURGH IN THE YEAR 1593 A.D.  WERE IMPRISONED FOR  \"PLAYING OF THE GOWFF ON THE LINKS OF LEITH  EVERY SABBATH THE TIME OF THE SERMONSES\",  ALSO OF ROBERT ROBERTSON WHO GOT IT IN THE NECK  IN 1604 A.D. FOR THE SAME REASON          FORE!      This book marks an epoch in my literary career. It is written in  blood. It is the outpouring of a soul as deeply seared by Fate's  unkindness as the fairway on the dog-leg hole of the second nine was  ever seared by my iron. It is the work of a very nearly desperate man,  an eighteen-handicap man who has got to look extremely slippy if he  doesn't want to find himself in the twenties again.    As a writer of light fiction, I have always till now been handicapped  by the fact that my disposition was cheerful, my heart intact, and my  life unsoured. Handicapped, I say, because the public likes to feel  that a writer of farcical stories is piquantly miserable in his private  life, and that, if he turns out anything amusing, he does it simply in  order to obtain relief from the almost insupportable weight of an  existence which he has long since realized to be a wash-out. Well,  today I am just like that.    Two years ago, I admit, I was a shallow _farceur_. My work lacked  depth. I wrote flippantly simply because I was having a thoroughly good  time. Then I took up golf, and now I can smile through the tears and  laugh, like Figaro, that I may not weep, and generally hold my head up  and feel that I am entitled to respect.    If you find anything in this volume that amuses you, kindly bear in  mind that it was probably written on my return home after losing three  balls in the gorse or breaking the head off a favourite driver: and,  with a murmured \"Brave fellow! Brave fellow!\" recall the story of the  clown jesting while his child lay dying at home. That is all. Thank you  for your sympathy. It means more to me than I can say. Do you think  that if I tried the square stance for a bit.... But, after all, this  cannot interest you. Leave me to my misery.      POSTSCRIPT.--In the second chapter I allude to Stout Cortez staring at  the Pacific. Shortly after the appearance of this narrative in serial  form in America, I received an anonymous letter containing the words,  \"You big stiff, it wasn't Cortez, it was Balboa.\" This, I believe, is  historically accurate. On the other hand, if Cortez was good enough for  Keats, he is good enough for me. Besides, even if it _was_ Balboa,  the Pacific was open for being stared at about that time, and I see no  reason why Cortez should not have had a look at it as well.

He sank moodily into an arm-chair  and pressed the bell.    \"Waiter!\"    \"Sir?\"    The young man pointed at the bag with every evidence of distaste.    \"You may have these clubs,\" he said. \"Take them away. If you don't want  them yourself, give them to one of the caddies.\"    Across the room the Oldest Member gazed at him with a grave sadness  through the smoke of his pipe. His eye was deep and dreamy--the eye of  a man who, as the poet says, has seen Golf steadily and seen it whole.    \"You are giving up golf?\" he said.    He was not altogether unprepared for such an attitude on the young  man's part: for from his eyrie on the terrace above the ninth green he  had observed him start out on the afternoon's round and had seen him  lose a couple of balls in the lake at the second hole after taking  seven strokes at the first.    \"Yes!\" cried the young man fiercely. \"For ever, dammit! Footling game!  Blanked infernal fat-headed silly ass of a game! Nothing but a waste of  time.\"    The Sage winced.    \"Don't say that, my boy.\"    \"But I do say it. What earthly good is golf? Life is stern and life is  earnest. We live in a practical age. All round us we see foreign  competition making itself unpleasant. And we spend our time playing  golf! What do we get out of it? Is golf any _use_? That's what I'm  asking you. Can you name me a single case where devotion to this  pestilential pastime has done a man any practical good?\"    The Sage smiled gently.    \"I could name a thousand.\"    \"One will do.\"    \"I will select,\" said the Sage, \"from the innumerable memories that  rush to my mind, the story of Cuthbert Banks.\"    \"Never heard of him.\"    \"Be of good cheer,\" said the Oldest Member. \"You are going to hear of  him now.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was in the picturesque little settlement of Wood Hills (said the  Oldest Member) that the incidents occurred which I am about to relate.  Even if you have never been in Wood Hills, that suburban paradise is  probably familiar to you by name. Situated at a convenient distance  from the city, it combines in a notable manner the advantages of town  life with the pleasant surroundings and healthful air of the country.  Its inhabitants live in commodious houses, standing in their own  grounds, and enjoy so many luxuries--such as gravel soil, main  drainage, electric light, telephone, baths (h. and c.), and company's  own water, that you might be pardoned for imagining life to be so ideal  for them that no possible improvement could be added to their lot. Mrs.  Willoughby Smethurst was under no such delusion. What Wood Hills needed  to make it perfect, she realized, was Culture. Material comforts are  all very well, but, if the _summum bonum_ is to be achieved, the  Soul also demands a look in, and it was Mrs. Smethurst's unfaltering  resolve that never while she had her strength should the Soul be handed  the loser's end. It was her intention to make Wood Hills a centre of  all that was most cultivated and refined, and, golly! how she had  succeeded. Under her presidency the Wood Hills Literary and Debating  Society had tripled its membership.    But there is always a fly in the ointment, a caterpillar in the salad.  The local golf club, an institution to which Mrs. Smethurst strongly  objected, had also tripled its membership; and the division of the  community into two rival camps, the Golfers and the Cultured, had  become more marked than ever. This division, always acute, had attained  now to the dimensions of a Schism. The rival sects treated one another  with a cold hostility.    Unfortunate episodes came to widen the breach. Mrs. Smethurst's house  adjoined the links, standing to the right of the fourth tee: and, as  the Literary Society was in the habit of entertaining visiting  lecturers, many a golfer had foozled his drive owing to sudden loud  outbursts of applause coinciding with his down-swing. And not long  before this story opens a sliced ball, whizzing in at the open window,  had come within an ace of incapacitating Raymond Parsloe Devine, the  rising young novelist (who rose at that moment a clear foot and a half)  from any further exercise of his art. Two inches, indeed, to the right  and Raymond must inevitably have handed in his dinner-pail.    To make matters worse, a ring at the front-door bell followed almost  immediately, and the maid ushered in a young man of pleasing appearance  in a sweater and baggy knickerbockers who apologetically but firmly  insisted on playing his ball where it lay, and, what with the shock of  the lecturer's narrow escape and the spectacle of the intruder standing  on the table and working away with a niblick, the afternoon's session  had to be classed as a complete frost. Mr. Devine's determination, from  which no argument could swerve him, to deliver the rest of his lecture  in the coal-cellar gave the meeting a jolt from which it never  recovered.    I have dwelt upon this incident, because it was the means of  introducing Cuthbert Banks to Mrs. Smethurst's niece, Adeline. As  Cuthbert, for it was he who had so nearly reduced the muster-roll of  rising novelists by one, hopped down from the table after his stroke,  he was suddenly aware that a beautiful girl was looking at him  intently. As a matter of fact, everyone in the room was looking at him  intently, none more so than Raymond Parsloe Devine, but none of the  others were beautiful girls. Long as the members of Wood Hills Literary  Society were on brain, they were short on looks, and, to Cuthbert's  excited eye, Adeline Smethurst stood out like a jewel in a pile of  coke.    He had never seen her before, for she had only arrived at her aunt's  house on the previous day, but he was perfectly certain that life, even  when lived in the midst of gravel soil, main drainage, and company's  own water, was going to be a pretty poor affair if he did not see her  again. Yes, Cuthbert was in love: and it is interesting to record, as  showing the effect of the tender emotion on a man's game, that twenty  minutes after he had met Adeline he did the short eleventh in one, and  as near as a toucher got a three on the four-hundred-yard twelfth.    I will skip lightly over the intermediate stages of Cuthbert's  courtship and come to the moment when--at the annual ball in aid of the  local Cottage Hospital, the only occasion during the year on which the  lion, so to speak, lay down with the lamb, and the Golfers and the  Cultured met on terms of easy comradeship, their differences  temporarily laid aside--he proposed to Adeline and was badly stymied.    That fair, soulful girl could not see him with a spy-glass.    \"Mr. Banks,\" she said, \"I will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#1)"],[1,"the Briton    A Story of the Roman Invasion      by G. A. Henty          PREFACE.    MY DEAR LADS,    My series of stories dealing with the wars of England would be  altogether incomplete did it not include the period when the Romans  were the masters of the country. The valour with which the natives  of this island defended themselves was acknowledged by the Roman  historians, and it was only the superior discipline of the invaders  that enabled them finally to triumph over the bravery and the  superior physical strength of the Britons. The Roman conquest for  the time was undoubtedly of immense advantage to the people--who  had previously wasted their energies in perpetual tribal wars--as  it introduced among them the civilization of Rome. In the end,  however, it proved disastrous to the islanders, who lost all their  military virtues. Having been defended from the savages of the  north by the soldiers of Rome, the Britons were, when the legions  were recalled, unable to offer any effectual resistance to the  Saxons, who, coming under the guise of friendship, speedily became  their masters, imposing a yoke infinitely more burdensome than that  of Rome, and erasing almost every sign of the civilization that had  been engrafted upon them. How far the British population disappeared  under the subsequent invasion and the still more oppressive yoke of  the Danes is uncertain; but as the invaders would naturally desire  to retain the people to cultivate the land for them, it is probable  that the great mass of the Britons were not exterminated. It is  at any rate pleasant to believe that with the Saxon, Danish, and  Norman blood in our veins, there is still a large admixture of that  of the valiant warriors who fought so bravely against Caesar, and  who rose under Boadicea in a desperate effort to shake off the  oppressive rule of Rome.    Yours truly,    G. A. Henty        CHAPTER I: A HOSTAGE      \"It is a fair sight.\"    \"It may be a fair sight in a Roman's eyes, Beric, but nought could  be fouler to those of a Briton. To me every one of those blocks of  brick and stone weighs down and helps to hold in bondage this land  of ours; while that temple they have dared to rear to their gods,  in celebration of their having conquered Britain, is an insult and  a lie. We are not conquered yet, as they will some day know to  their cost. We are silent, we wait, but we do not admit that we  are conquered.\"    \"I agree with you there. We have never fairly tried our strength  against them. These wretched divisions have always prevented our  making an effort to gather; Cassivelaunus and some of the Kentish  tribes alone opposed them at their first landing, and he was  betrayed and abandoned by the tribes on the north of the Thames. It  has been the same thing ever since. We fight piecemeal; and while  the Romans hurl their whole strength against one tribe the others  look on with folded hands. Who aided the Trinobantes when the  Romans defeated them and established themselves on that hill? No  one. They will eat Britain up bit by bit.\"    \"Then you like them no better for having lived among them, Beric?\"    \"I like them more, but I fear them more. One cannot be four years  among them, as I was, without seeing that in many respects we might  copy them with advantage. They are a great people. Compare their  splendid mansions and their regular orderly life, their manners and  their ways, with our rough huts, and our feasts, ending as often  as not with quarrels and brawls. Look at their arts, their power  of turning stone into lifelike figures, and above all, the way in  which they can transfer their thoughts to white leaves, so that  others, many many years hence, can read them and know all that was  passing, and what men thought and did in the long bygone. Truly it  is marvellous.\"    \"You are half Romanized, Beric,\" his companion said roughly.    \"I think not,\" the other said quietly; \"I should be worse than  a fool had I lived, as I have done, a hostage among them for four  years without seeing that there is much to admire, much that we  could imitate with advantage, in their life and ways; but there  is no reason because they are wiser and far more polished, and in  many respects a greater people than we, that they should come here  to be our masters. These things are desirable, but they are as  nothing to freedom. I have said that I like them more for being  among them. I like them more for many reasons. They are grave and  courteous in their manner to each other; they obey their own laws;  every man has his rights; and while all yield obedience to their  superiors, the superiors respect the rights of those below them.  The highest among them cannot touch the property or the life of  the lowest in rank. All this seems to me excellent; but then, on  the other hand, my blood boils in my veins at the contempt in which  they hold us; at their greed, their rapacity, their brutality, their  denial to us of all rights. In their eyes we are but savages, but  wild men, who may be useful for tilling the ground for them, but  who, if troublesome, should be hunted down and slain like wild  beasts. I admire them for what they can do; I respect them for  their power and learning; but I hate them as our oppressors.\"    \"That is better, Beric, much better. I had begun to fear that the  grand houses and the splendour of these Romans might have sapped  your patriotism. I hate them all; I hate changes; I would live as  we have always lived.\"    \"But you forget, Boduoc, that we ourselves have not been standing  still. Though our long past forefathers, when they crossed from  Gaul wave after wave, were rude warriors, we have been learning  ever since from Gaul as the Gauls have learned from the Romans,  and the Romans themselves admit that we have advanced greatly since  the days when, under their Caesar, they first landed here. Look at  the town on the hill there. Though 'tis Roman now 'tis not changed  so much from what it was under that great king Cunobeline, while  his people had knowledge of many things of which we and the other  tribes of the Iceni knew nothing.\"    \"What good did it do them?\" the other asked scornfully; \"they lie  prostrate under the Roman yoke. It was easy to destroy their towns  while we, who have few towns to destroy, live comparatively free.  Look across at Camalodunum, Cunobeline's capital. Where are the  men who built the houses, who dressed in soft garments, who aped  the Romans, and who regarded us as well nigh savage men? Gone  every one of them; hewn down on their own hearthstones, or thrust  out with their wives and families to wander homeless--is there  one left of them in yonder town? Their houses they were so proud  of, their cultivated fields, their wealth of all kinds has been  seized by the Romans. Did they fight any better for their Roman  fashions? Not they; the kingdom of Cunobeline, from the Thames to  the western sea, fell to pieces at a touch and it was only among the  wild Silures that Caractacus was able to make any great resistance.\"    \"But we did no better, Boduoc; Ostorius crushed us as easily as  Claudius crushed the Trinobantes. It is no use our setting ourselves  against change. All that you urge against the Trinobantes and the  tribes of Kent the Silures might urge with equal force against us.  You must remember that we were like them not so many ages back.  The intercourse of the Gauls with us on this eastern sea coast, and  with the Kentish tribes, has changed us greatly. We are no longer,  like the western tribes, mere hunters living in shelters of boughs  and roaming the forests. Our dress, with our long mantles, our loose  vests and trousers, differs as widely from that of these western  tribes as it does from the Romans. We live in towns, and if our  houses are rude they are solid. We no longer depend solely on the  chase, but till the ground and have our herds of cattle. I daresay  there were many of our ancestors who set themselves as much against  the Gaulish customs as you do against those of the Romans; but we  adopted them, and benefited by them, and though I would exult in  seeing the last Roman driven from our land, I should like after  their departure to see us adopt what is good and orderly and decent  in their customs and laws.\"    Beric's companion growled a malediction upon everything Roman.    \"There is one thing certain,\" he said after a pause, \"either they  must go altogether, not only here but everywhere--they must  learn, as our ancestors taught them at their two first invasions,  that it is hopeless to conquer Britain--or they will end by being  absolute masters of the island, and we shall be their servants and  slaves.\"    \"That is true enough,\" Beric agreed; \"but to conquer we must be  united, and not only united but steadfast. Of course I have learned  much of them while I have been with them. I have come to speak  their language, and have listened to their talk. It is not only the  Romans who are here whom we have to defeat, it is those who will  come after them. The power of Rome is great; how great we cannot  tell, but it is wonderful and almost inconceivable. They have  spread over vast countries, reducing peoples everywhere under their  dominion. I have seen what they call maps showing the world as far  as they know it, and well nigh all has been conquered by them; but  the farther away from Rome the more difficulty have they in holding  what they have conquered.    \"That is our hope here; we are very far from Rome. They may send  army after army against us, but in time they will get weary of  the loss and expense when there is so little to gain, and as after  their first invasions a long time elapsed before they again troubled  us, so in the end they may abandon a useless enterprise. Even now  the Romans grumble at what they call their exile, but they are  obstinate and tenacious, and to rid our land of them for good it  would be necessary for"]]]
