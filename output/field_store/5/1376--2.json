These letters, their writer is aware, justly incur the reproach of  egotism and triviality; at the same time she did not see how this was  to be avoided, without lessening their value as the exact account of  a lady's experience of the brighter and less practical side of  colonization. They are published as no guide or handbook for \"the  intending emigrant;\" that person has already a literature to himself,  and will scarcely find here so much as a single statistic. They simply  record the expeditions, adventures, and emergencies diversifying the  daily life of the wife of a New Zealand sheep-farmer; and, as each was  written while the novelty and excitement of the scenes it describes were  fresh upon her, they may succeed in giving here in England an adequate  impression of the delight and freedom of an existence so far removed  from our own highly-wrought civilization: not failing in this, the  writer will gladly bear the burden of any critical rebuke the letters  deserve. One thing she hopes will plainly appear,--that, however hard  it was to part, by the width of the whole earth, from dear friends and  spots scarcely less dear, yet she soon found in that new country new  friends and a new home; costing her in their turn almost as many parting  regrets as the old.    F. N. B.          Letter I: Two months at sea--Melbourne.      Port Phillip Hotel, Melbourne. September 22d, 1865. .... Now I must  give you an account of our voyage: it has been a very quick one for  the immense distance traversed, sometimes under canvas, but generally  steaming. We saw no land between the Lizard and Cape Otway light--that  is, for fifty-seven days: and oh, the monotony of that time!--the  monotony of it! Our decks were so crowded that we divided our walking  hours, in order that each set of passengers might have space to move  about; for if every one had taken it into their heads to exercise  themselves at the same time, we could hardly have exceeded the  fisherman's definition of a walk, \"two steps and overboard.\" I am  ashamed to say I was more or less ill all the way, but, fortunately,  F---- was not, and I rejoiced at this from the most selfish motives, as  he was able to take care of me. I find that sea-sickness develops the  worst part of one's character with startling rapidity, and, as far as  I am concerned, I look back with self-abasement upon my callous  indifference to the sufferings of others, and apathetic absorption in my  individual misery.    Until we had fairly embarked, the well-meaning but ignorant among our  friends constantly assured us, with an air of conviction as to the truth  and wisdom of their words, that we were going at the very best season  of the year; but as soon as we could gather the opinions of those in  authority on board, it gradually leaked out that we really had fallen  upon quite a wrong time for such a voyage, for we very soon found  ourselves in the tropics during their hottest month (early in August),  and after having been nearly roasted for three weeks, we plunged  abruptly into mid-winter, or at all events very early spring, off the  Cape of Good Hope, and went through a season of bitterly cold weather,  with three heavy gales. I pitied the poor sailors from the bottom of my  heart, at their work all night on decks slippery with ice, and pulling  at ropes so frozen that it was almost impossible to bend them; but,  thank God, there were no casualties among the men. The last gale was the  most severe; they said it was the tail of a cyclone. One is apt on land  to regard such phrases as the \"shriek of the storm,\" or \"the roar of  the waves,\" as poetical hyperboles; whereas they are very literal and  expressive renderings of the sounds of horror incessant throughout  a gale at sea. Our cabin, though very nice and comfortable in other  respects, possessed an extraordinary attraction for any stray wave which  might be wandering about the saloon: once or twice I have been in the  cuddy when a sea found its way down the companion, and I have watched  with horrible anxiety a ton or so of water hesitating which cabin it  should enter and deluge, and it always seemed to choose ours. All these  miseries appear now, after even a few days of the blessed land, to  belong to a distant past; but I feel inclined to lay my pen down and  have a hearty laugh at the recollection of one cold night, when a heavy  \"thud\" burst open our cabin door, and washed out all the stray parcels,  boots, etc., from the corners in which the rolling of the ship had  previously bestowed them. I was high and dry in the top berth, but poor  F---- in the lower recess was awakened by the douche, and no words of  mine can convey to you the utter absurdity of his appearance, as he  nimbly mounted on the top of a chest of drawers close by, and crouched  there, wet and shivering, handing me up a most miscellaneous assortment  of goods to take care of in my little dry nest.    Some of our fellow-passengers were very good-natured, and devoted  themselves to cheering and enlivening us by getting up concerts, little  burlesques and other amusements; and very grateful we were for their  efforts: they say that \"anything is fun in the country,\" but on board  ship a little wit goes a very long way indeed, for all are only too  ready and anxious to be amused. The whole dramatic strength of the  company was called into force for the performance of \"The Rivals,\"  which was given a week or so before the end of the voyage. It went off  wonderfully well; but I confess I enjoyed the preparations more than the  play itself: the ingenuity displayed was very amusing at the time. You  on shore cannot imagine how difficult it was to find a snuff-box for  \"Sir Anthony Absolute,\" or with what joy and admiration we welcomed a  clever substitute for it in the shape of a match-box covered with the  lead out of a tea-chest most ingeniously modelled into an embossed  wreath round the lid, with a bunch of leaves and buds in the centre, the  whole being brightly burnished: at the performance the effect of this  little \"property\" was really excellent. Then, at the last moment, poor  \"Bob Acres\" had to give in, and acknowledge that he could not speak for  coughing; he had been suffering from bronchitis for some days past, but  had gallantly striven to make himself heard at rehearsals; so on the day  of the play F---- had the part forced on him. There was no time to learn  his \"words,\" so he wrote out all of them in large letters on slips of  paper and fastened them on the beams. This device was invisible to the  audience, but he was obliged to go through his scenes with his head as  high up as if he had on a martingale; however, we were all so indulgent  that at any little _contretemps_, such as one of the actresses  forgetting her part or being seized by stage-fright, the applause was  much greater than when things went smoothly.    I can hardly believe that it is only two days since we steamed into  Hobson's Bay, on a lovely bright spring morning. At dinner, the evening  before, our dear old captain had said that we should see the revolving  light on the nearest headland about eight o'clock that evening, and so  we did. You will not think me childish, if I acknowledge that my eyes  were so full of tears I could hardly see it after the first glimpse;  it is impossible to express in a letter all the joy and thankfulness of  such a moment. Feelings like these are forgotten only too quickly in  the jar and bustle of daily life, and we are always ready to take as a  matter of course those mercies which are new every morning; but when  I realized that all the tosses and tumbles of so many weary days and  nights were over, and that at last we had reached the haven where we  would be, my first thought was one of deep gratitude. It was easy to  see that it was a good moment with everyone; squabbles were made up with  surprising quickness; shy people grew suddenly sociable; some who had  comfortable homes to go to on landing gave kind and welcome invitations  to others, who felt themselves sadly strange in a new country; and it  was with really a lingering feeling of regret that we all separated at  last, though a very short time before we should have thought it quite  impossible to be anything but delighted to leave the ship.    We have not seen much of Melbourne yet, as there has been a great deal  to do in looking after the luggage, and at first one is capable  of nothing but a delightful idleness. The keenest enjoyment is a  fresh-water bath, and next to that is the new and agreeable luxury of  the ample space for dressing; and then it is so pleasant to suffer no  anxiety as to the brushes and combs tumbling about. I should think that  even the vainest woman in the world would find her toilet and its duties  a daily trouble and a sorrow at sea, on account of the unsteadiness  of all things. The next delight is standing at the window, and seeing  horses, and trees, and dogs--in fact, all the \"treasures of the land;\"  as for flowers--beautiful as they are at all times--you cannot learn  to appreciate them enough until you have been deprived of them for two  months.    You know that I have travelled a good deal in various parts of the  world, but I have never seen anything at all like Melbourne. In other  countries, it is generally the antiquity of the cities, and their  historical reminiscences, which appeal to the imagination; but _here_,  the interest is as great from exactly the opposite cause. It is most  wonderful to walk through a splendid town, with magnificent public  buildings, churches, shops, clubs, theatres, with the streets well  paved and lighted, and to think that less than forty years ago it was a  desolate swamp without even a hut upon it. How little an English country  town progresses in forty years, and here is a splendid city created in  that time!

My Uncle's Gift Is Many Times Multiplied        CHAPTER I    THE MAN ON THE KIRKCAPLE SHORE    I mind as if it were yesterday my first sight of the man.  Little I  knew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how often that  face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep and disturb my  waking hours.  But I mind yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a  terror which was surely more than the due of a few truant lads breaking  the Sabbath with their play.    The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross  my father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of  Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea.  Round the horns of  land which enclose the bay the coast shows on either side a battlement  of stark red cliffs through which a burn or two makes a pass to the  water's edge.  The bay itself is ringed with fine clean sands, where we  lads of the burgh school loved to bathe in the warm weather.  But on  long holidays the sport was to go farther afield among the cliffs; for  there there were many deep caves and pools, where podleys might be  caught with the line, and hid treasures sought for at the expense of  the skin of the knees and the buttons of the trousers.  Many a long  Saturday I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, having lit a fire of  driftwood, and made believe that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite new  landed from France.  There was a band of us in Kirkcaple, lads of my  own age, including Archie Leslie, the son of my father's session-clerk,  and Tam Dyke, the provost's nephew.  We were sealed to silence by the  blood oath, and we bore each the name of some historic pirate or  sailorman.  I was Paul Jones, Tam was Captain Kidd, and Archie, need I  say it, was Morgan himself.  Our tryst was a cave where a little water  called the Dyve Burn had cut its way through the cliffs to the sea.  There we forgathered in the summer evenings and of a Saturday afternoon  in winter, and told mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly  hearts.  But the sober truth is that our deeds were of the humblest,  and a dozen of fish or a handful of apples was all our booty, and our  greatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the Dyve tan-work.    My father's spring Communion fell on the last Sabbath of April, and on  the particular Sabbath of which I speak the weather was mild and bright  for the time of year.  I had been surfeited with the Thursday's and  Saturday's services, and the two long diets of worship on the Sabbath  were hard for a lad of twelve to bear with the spring in his bones and  the sun slanting through the gallery window.  There still remained the  service on the Sabbath evening--a doleful prospect, for the Rev. Mr  Murdoch of Kilchristie, noted for the length of his discourses, had  exchanged pulpits with my father.  So my mind was ripe for the proposal  of Archie Leslie, on our way home to tea, that by a little skill we  might give the kirk the slip.  At our Communion the pews were emptied  of their regular occupants and the congregation seated itself as it  pleased.  The manse seat was full of the Kirkcaple relations of Mr  Murdoch, who had been invited there by my mother to hear him, and it  was not hard to obtain permission to sit with Archie and Tam Dyke in  the cock-loft in the gallery.  Word was sent to Tam, and so it happened  that three abandoned lads duly passed the plate and took their seats in  the cock-loft.  But when the bell had done jowing, and we heard by the  sounds of their feet that the elders had gone in to the kirk, we  slipped down the stairs and out of the side door.  We were through the  churchyard in a twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the Dyve Burn.  It was the fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to put their boys into  what were known as Eton suits--long trousers, cut-away jackets, and  chimney-pot hats.  I had been one of the earliest victims, and well I  remember how I fled home from the Sabbath school with the snowballs of  the town roughs rattling off my chimney-pot.  Archie had followed, his  family being in all things imitators of mine.  We were now clothed in  this wearisome garb, so our first care was to secrete safely our hats  in a marked spot under some whin bushes on the links. Tam was free from  the bondage of fashion, and wore his ordinary best knickerbockers.  From inside his jacket he unfolded his special treasure, which was to  light us on our expedition--an evil-smelling old tin lantern with a  shutter.    Tam was of the Free Kirk persuasion, and as his Communion fell on a  different day from ours, he was spared the bondage of church attendance  from which Archie and I had revolted.  But notable events had happened  that day in his church.  A black man, the Rev. John  Something-or-other, had been preaching.  Tam was full of the portent.  'A nagger,' he said, 'a great black chap as big as your father,  Archie.'  He seemed to have banged the bookboard with some effect, and  had kept Tam, for once in his life, awake.  He had preached about the  heathen in Africa, and how a black man was as good as a white man in  the sight of God, and he had forecast a day when the negroes would have  something to teach the British in the way of civilization.  So at any  rate ran the account of Tam Dyke, who did not share the preacher's  views.  'It's all nonsense, Davie.  The Bible says that the children of  Ham were to be our servants.  If I were the minister I wouldn't let a  nigger into the pulpit.  I wouldn't let him farther than the Sabbath  school.'    Night fell as we came to the broomy spaces of the links, and ere we had  breasted the slope of the neck which separates Kirkcaple Bay from the  cliffs it was as dark as an April evening with a full moon can be.  Tam  would have had it darker.  He got out his lantern, and after a  prodigious waste of matches kindled the candle-end inside, turned the  dark shutter, and trotted happily on.  We had no need of his lighting  till the Dyve Burn was reached and the path began to descend steeply  through the rift in the crags.    It was here we found that some one had gone before us. Archie was great  in those days at tracking, his ambition running in Indian paths.  He  would walk always with his head bent and his eyes on the ground,  whereby he several times found lost coins and once a trinket dropped by  the provost's wife.  At the edge of the burn, where the path turns  downward, there is a patch of shingle washed up by some spate.  Archie  was on his knees in a second.  'Lads,' he cried, 'there's spoor here;'  and then after some nosing, 'it's a man's track, going downward, a big  man with flat feet.  It's fresh, too, for it crosses the damp bit of  gravel, and the water has scarcely filled the holes yet.'    We did not dare to question Archie's woodcraft, but it puzzled us who  the stranger could be.  In summer weather you might find a party of  picnickers here, attracted by the fine hard sands at the burn mouth.  But at this time of night and season of the year there was no call for  any one to be trespassing on our preserves.  No fishermen came this  way, the lobster-pots being all to the east, and the stark headland of  the Red Neb made the road to them by the water's edge difficult.  The  tan-work lads used to come now and then for a swim, but you would not  find a tan-work lad bathing on a chill April night. Yet there was no  question where our precursor had gone.  He was making for the shore.  Tam unshuttered his lantern, and the steps went clearly down the  corkscrew path.  'Maybe he is after our cave.  We'd better go cannily.'    The glim was dowsed--the words were Archie's--and in the best  contraband manner we stole down the gully.  The business had suddenly  taken an eerie turn, and I think in our hearts we were all a little  afraid.  But Tam had a lantern, and it would never do to turn back from  an adventure which had all the appearance of being the true sort.  Half  way down there is a scrog of wood, dwarf alders and hawthorn, which  makes an arch over the path.  I, for one, was glad when we got through  this with no worse mishap than a stumble from Tam which caused the  lantern door to fly open and the candle to go out. We did not stop to  relight it, but scrambled down the screes till we came to the long  slabs of reddish rock which abutted on the beach.  We could not see the  track, so we gave up the business of scouts, and dropped quietly over  the big boulder and into the crinkle of cliff which we called our cave.    There was nobody there, so we relit the lantern and examined our  properties.  Two or three fishing-rods for the burn, "]]]
