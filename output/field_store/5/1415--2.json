Tony Graham  looked up from his bag.    'Hullo, Allen,' he said, 'what the dickens are you up here for?'    'I was rather thinking of doing a little boxing. If you've no  objection, of course.'    'But you ought to be on a bed of sickness, and that sort of thing. I  heard you'd crocked yourself.'    'So I did. Nothing much, though. Trod on myself during a game of fives,  and twisted my ankle a bit.'    'In for the middles, of course?'    'Yes.'    'So am I.'    'Yes, so I saw in the Sportsman. It says you weigh eleven-three.'    'Bit more, really, I believe. Shan't be able to have any lunch, or I  shall have to go in for the heavies. What are you?'    'Just eleven. Well, let's hope we meet in the final.'    'Rather,' said Tony.    It was at Aldershot--to be more exact, in the dressing-room of the  Queen's Avenue Gymnasium at Aldershot--that the conversation took  place. From east and west, and north and south, from Dan even unto  Beersheba, the representatives of the public schools had assembled to  box, fence, and perform gymnastic prodigies for fame and silver medals.  The room was full of all sorts and sizes of them, heavy-weights looking  ponderous and muscular, feather-weights diminutive but wiry,  light-weights, middle-weights, fencers, and gymnasts in scores, some  wearing the unmistakable air of the veteran, for whom Aldershot has no  mysteries, others nervous, and wishing themselves back again at school.    Tony Graham had chosen a corner near the door. This was his first  appearance at Aldershot. St Austin's was his School, and he was by far  the best middle-weight there. But his doubts as to his ability to hold  his own against all-comers were extreme, nor were they lessened by the  knowledge that his cousin, Allen Thomson, was to be one of his  opponents. Indeed, if he had not been a man of mettle, he might well  have thought that with Allen's advent his chances were at an end.    Allen was at Rugby. He was the son of a baronet who owned many acres in  Wiltshire, and held fixed opinions on the subject of the whole duty of  man, who, he held, should be before anything else a sportsman. Both the  Thomsons--Allen's brother Jim was at St Austin's in the same House as  Tony--were good at most forms of sport. Jim, however, had never taken  to the art of boxing very kindly, but, by way of compensation, Allen  had skill enough for two. He was a splendid boxer, quick, neat,  scientific. He had been up to Aldershot three times, once as a  feather-weight and twice as a light-weight, and each time he had  returned with the silver medal.    As for Tony, he was more a fighter than a sparrer. When he paid a visit  to his uncle's house he boxed with Allen daily, and invariably got the  worst of it. Allen was too quick for him. But he was clever with his  hands. His supply of pluck was inexhaustible, and physically he was as  hard as nails.    'Is your ankle all right again, now?' he asked.    'Pretty well. It wasn't much of a sprain. Interfered with my training a  good bit, though. I ought by rights to be well under eleven stone.  You're all right, I suppose?'    'Not bad. Boxing takes it out of you more than footer or a race. I was  in good footer training long before I started to get fit for Aldershot.  But I think I ought to get along fairly well. Any idea who's in against  us?'    'Harrow, Felsted, Wellington. That's all, I think.'    'St Paul's?'    'No.'    'Good. Well, I hope your first man mops you up. I've a conscientious  objection to scrapping with you.'    Allen laughed. 'You'd be all right,' he said, 'if you weren't so  beastly slow with your guard. Why don't you wake up? You hit like  blazes.'    'I think I shall start guarding two seconds before you lead. By the  way, don't have any false delicacy about spoiling my aristocratic  features. On the ground of relationship, you know.'    'Rather not. Let auld acquaintance be forgot. I'm not Thomson for the  present. I'm Rugby.'    'Just so, and I'm St Austin's. Personally, I'm going for the knock-out.  You won't feel hurt?'    This was in the days before the Headmasters' Conference had abolished  the knock-out blow, and a boxer might still pay attentions to the point  of his opponent's jaw with an easy conscience.    'I probably shall if it comes off,' said Allen. 'I say, it occurs to me  that we shall be weighing-in in a couple of minutes, and I haven't  started to change yet. Good, I've not brought evening dress or somebody  else's footer clothes, as usually happens on these festive occasions.'    He was just pulling on his last boot when a Gymnasium official appeared  in the doorway.    'Will all those who are entering for the boxing get ready for the  weighing-in, please?' he said, and a general exodus ensued.    The weighing-in at the Public Schools' Boxing Competition is something  in the nature of a religious ceremony, but even religious ceremonies  come to an end, and after a quarter of an hour or so Tony was weighed  in the balance and found correct. He strolled off on a tour of  inspection.    After a time he lighted upon the St Austin's Gym Instructor, whom he  had not seen since they had parted that morning, the one on his way to  the dressing-room, the other to the refreshment-bar for a modest  quencher.    'Well, Mr Graham?'    'Hullo, Dawkins. What time does this show start? Do you know when the  middle-weights come on?'    'Well, you can't say for certain. They may keep 'em back a bit or they  may make a start with 'em first thing. No, the light-weights are going  to start. What number did you draw, sir?'    'One.'    'Then you'll be in the first middle-weight pair. That'll be after these  two gentlemen.'    'These two gentlemen', the first of the light-weights, were by this  time in the middle of a warmish opening round. Tony watched them with  interest and envy. 'How beastly nippy they are,' he said.    'Wish I could duck like that,' he added.    'Well, the 'ole thing there is you 'ave to watch the other man's eyes.  But light-weights is always quicker at the duck than what heavier men  are. You get the best boxing in the light-weights, though the feathers  spar quicker.'    Soon afterwards the contest finished, amidst volleys of applause. It  had been a spirited battle, and an exceedingly close thing. The umpires  disagreed. After a short consultation, the referee gave it as his  opinion that on the whole R. Cloverdale, of Bedford, had had a shade  the worse of the exchanges, and that in consequence J. Robinson, of St  Paul's, was the victor. This was what he meant. What he said was,  'Robinson wins,' in a sharp voice, as if somebody were arguing about  it. The pair then shook hands and retired.    'First bout, middle-weights,' shrilled the M.C. 'W.P. Ross (Wellington)  and A.C.R. Graham (St Austin's).'    Tony and his opponent retired for a moment to the changing-room, and  then made their way amidst applause on to the raised stage on which the  ring was pitched. Mr W.P. Ross proceeded to the farther corner of the  ring, where he sat down and was vigorously massaged by his two seconds.  Tony took the opposite corner and submitted himself to the same  process. It is a very cheering thing at any time to have one's arms and  legs kneaded like bread, and it is especially pleasant if one is at all  nervous. It sends a glow through the entire frame. Like somebody's  something it is both grateful and comforting.    Tony's seconds were curious specimens of humanity. One was a gigantic  soldier, very gruff and taciturn, and with decided leanings towards  pessimism. The other was also a soldier. He was in every way his  colleague's opposite. He was half his size, had red hair, and was  bubbling over with conversation. The other could not interfere with his  hair or his size, but he could with his conversation, and whenever he  attempted a remark, he was promptly silenced, much to his disgust.    'Plenty o' moosle 'ere, Fred,' he began, as he rubbed Tony's left arm.    'Moosle ain't everything,' said the other, gloomily, and there was  silence again.    'Are you ready? Seconds away,' said the referee.    'Time!'    The two stood up to one another.    The Wellington representative was a plucky boxer, but he was not in the  same class as Tony. After a few exchanges, the latter got to work, and  after that there was only one man in the ring. In the middle of the  second round the referee stopped the fight, and gave it to Tony, who  came away as fresh as he had started, and a great deal happier and more  confident.    'Did us proud, Fred,' began the garrulous man.    'Yes, but that 'un ain't nothing. You wait till he meets young Thomson.  I've seen 'im box 'ere three years, and never bin beat yet. Three  bloomin' years. Yus.'    This might have depressed anybody else, but as Tony already knew all  there was to be known about Allen's skill with the gloves, it had no  effect upon him.    A sanguinary heavy-weight encounter was followed by the first bout of  the feathers and the second of the light-weights, and then it was  Allen's turn to fight the Harrow representative.    It was not a very exciting bout."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#1)"],[1,"PREFECT'S UNCLE          by P. G. Wodehouse    1903            [Dedication]  TO W.

The noise brought  William into the room. William was attached to Leicester's House,  Beckford College, as a mixture of butler and bootboy. He carried a pail  of water in his hand. He had been engaged in cleaning up the House  against the conclusion of the summer holidays, of which this was the  last evening, by the simple process of transferring all dust, dirt, and  other foreign substances from the floor to his own person.    ''Ullo, Mr Marriott,' he said.    'Hullo, William,' said Marriott. 'How are you? Still jogging along?  That's a mercy. I say, look here, I want a quiet word in season with  the authorities. They must have known I was coming back this evening.  Of course they did. Why, they specially wrote and asked me. Well,  where's the red carpet? Where's the awning? Where's the brass band that  ought to have met me at the station? Where's anything? I tell you what  it is, William, my old companion, there's a bad time coming for the  Headmaster if he doesn't mind what he's doing. He must learn that life  is stern and life is earnest, William. Has Gethryn come back yet?'    William, who had been gasping throughout this harangue, for the  intellectual pressure of Marriott's conversation (of which there was  always plenty) was generally too much for him, caught thankfully at the  last remark as being the only intelligible one uttered up to present  date, and made answer--    'Mr Gethryn 'e's gorn out on to the field, Mr Marriott. 'E come 'arf an  hour ago.'    'Oh! Right. Thanks. Goodbye, William. Give my respects to the cook, and  mind you don't work too hard. Think what it would be if you developed  heart disease. Awful! You mustn't do it, William.'    Marriott vanished, and William, slightly dazed, went about his  professional duties once more. Marriott walked out into the grounds in  search of Gethryn. Gethryn was the head of Leicester's this term,  _vice_ Reynolds departed, and Marriott, who was second man up,  shared a study with him. Leicester's had not a good name at Beckford,  in spite of the fact that it was generally in the running for the  cricket and football cups. The fact of the matter was that, with the  exception of Gethryn, Marriott, a boy named Reece, who kept wicket for  the School Eleven, and perhaps two others, Leicester's seniors were not  a good lot. To the School in general, who gauged a fellow's character  principally by his abilities in the cricket and football fields, it  seemed a very desirable thing to be in Leicester's. They had been  runners-up for the House football cup that year, and this term might  easily see the cricket cup fall to them. Amongst the few, however, it  was known that the House was passing through an unpleasant stage in its  career. A House is either good or bad. It is seldom that it can combine  the advantages of both systems. Leicester's was bad.    This was due partly to a succession of bad Head-prefects, and partly to  Leicester himself, who was well-meaning but weak. His spirit was  willing, but his will was not spirited. When things went on that ought  not to have gone on, he generally managed to avoid seeing them, and the  things continued to go on. Altogether, unless Gethryn's rule should act  as a tonic, Leicester's was in a bad way.    The Powers that Be, however, were relying on Gethryn to effect some  improvement. He was in the Sixth, the First Fifteen, and the First  Eleven. Also a backbone was included in his anatomy, and if he made up  his mind to a thing, that thing generally happened.    The Rev. James Beckett, the Headmaster of Beckford, had formed a very  fair estimate of Gethryn's capabilities, and at the moment when  Marriott was drawing the field for the missing one, that worthy was  sitting in the Headmaster's study with a cup in his right hand and a  muffin (half-eaten) in his left, drinking in tea and wisdom  simultaneously. The Head was doing most of the talking. He had led up  to the subject skilfully, and, once reached, he did not leave it. The  text of his discourse was the degeneracy of Leicester's.    'Now, you know, Gethryn--another muffin? Help yourself. You know,  Reynolds--well, he was a capital boy in his way, capital, and I'm sure  we shall all miss him very much--_but_ he was not a good head of a  House. He was weak. Much too weak. Too easy-going. You must avoid that,  Gethryn. Reynolds....' And much more in the same vein. Gethryn left the  room half an hour later full of muffins and good resolutions. He met  Marriott at the fives-courts.    'Where have you been to?' asked Marriott. 'I've been looking for you  all over the shop.'    'I and my friend the Headmaster,' said Gethryn, 'have been having a  quiet pot of tea between us.'    'Really? Was he affable?'    'Distinctly affable.'    'You know,' said Marriott confidentially, 'he asked me in, but I told  him it wasn't good enough. I said that if he would consent to make his  tea with water that wasn't two degrees below lukewarm, and bring on his  muffins cooked instead of raw, and supply some butter to eat with them,  I might look him up now and then. Otherwise it couldn't be done at the  price. But what did he want you for, really?'    'He was ragging me about the House. Quite right, too. You know, there's  no doubt about it, Leicester's does want bucking up.'    'We're going to get the cricket cup,' said Marriott, for the defence.    'We may. If it wasn't for the Houses in between. School House and  Jephson's especially. And anyhow, that's not what I meant. The games  are all right. It's--'    'The moral _je-ne-sais-quoi_, so to speak,' said Marriott.  'That'll be all right. Wait till we get at 'em. What I want you to turn  your great brain to now is this letter.'    He produced a letter from his pocket. 'Don't you bar chaps who show you  their letters?' he said. 'This was written by an aunt of mine. I don't  want to inflict the whole lot on you. Just look at line four. You see  what she says: \"A boy is coming to Mr Leicester's House this term, whom  I particularly wish you to befriend. He is the son of a great friend of  a friend of mine, and is a nice, bright little fellow, very jolly and  full of spirits.\"'    'That means,' interpolated Gethryn grimly, 'that he is up to the eyes  in pure, undiluted cheek, and will want kicking after every meal and  before retiring to rest. Go on.'    'His name is--'    'Well?'    'That's the point. At this point the manuscript becomes absolutely  illegible. I have conjectured Percy for the first name. It may be  Richard, but I'll plunge on Percy. It's the surname that stumps me.  Personally, I think it's MacCow, though I trust it isn't, for the kid's  sake. I showed the letter to my brother, the one who's at Oxford. He  swore it was Watson, but, on being pressed, hedged with Sandys. You may  as well contribute your little bit. What do you make of it?'    Gethryn scrutinized the document with care.    'She begins with a D. You can see that.'    'Well?'    'Next letter a or u. I see. Of course. It's Duncan.'    'Think so?' said Marriott doubtfully. 'Well, let's go and ask the  matron if she knows anything about him.'    'Miss Jones,' he said, when they had reached the House, 'have you on  your list of new boys a sportsman of the name of MacCow or Watson? I am  also prepared to accept Sandys or Duncan. The Christian name is either  Richard or Percy. There, that gives you a fairly wide field to choose  from.'    'There's a P. V. Wilson on the list,' said the matron, after an  inspection of that document.    'That must be the man,' said Marriott. 'Thanks very much. I suppose he  hasn't arrived yet?'    'No, not yet. You two are the only ones so far.'    'Oh! Well, I suppose I shall have to see him when he does come. I'll  come down for him later on.'    They strolled out on to the field again.    'In _re_ the proposed bucking-up of the House,' said Marriott,  'it'll be rather a big job.'    'Rather. I should think so. We ought to have a most fearfully sporting  time. It's got to be done. The Old Man talked to me like several  fathers.'    'What did he say?'    'Oh, heaps of things.'    'I know. Did he mention amongst other things that Reynolds was the  worst idiot on the face of this so-called world?'    'Something of the sort.'    'So I should think. The late Reynolds was a perfect specimen of the  gelatine-backboned worm. That's not my own, but it's the only  description of him that really suits. Monk and Danvers and the mob in  general used to do what they liked with him. Talking of Monk, when you  embark on your tour of moral agitation, I should advise you to start  with him.'    'Yes. And Danvers. There isn't much to choose between them. It's a pity  they're both such good bats. When you see a chap putting them through  the slips like Monk does, you can't help thinking there must be  something in him.'    'So there is,' said Marriott, 'and it's all bad. I bar the man. He's  slimy. It's the only word for him. And he uses scent by the gallon.  Thank goodness this is his last term.'    'Is it really? I never heard that.'    'Yes. He and Danvers are both leaving. Monk's going to Heidelberg to  study "]]]
