JTABLE 10 31 1      Preface    Since the publication of my two animal books, \"Kazan, the Wolf Dog\" and  \"The Grizzly King,\" I have received so many hundreds of letters from  friends of wild animal life, all of which were more or less of an  inquiring nature, that I have been encouraged to incorporate in this  preface of the third of my series--\"Baree, Son of Kazan\"--something  more of my desire and hope in writing of wild life, and something of  the foundation of fact whereupon this and its companion books have been  written.    I have always disliked the preaching of sermons in the pages of  romance. It is like placing a halter about an unsuspecting reader's  neck and dragging him into paths for which he may have no liking. But  if fact and truth produce in the reader's mind a message for himself,  then a work has been done. That is what I hope for in my nature books.  The American people are not and never have been lovers of wild life. As  a nation we have gone after Nature with a gun.    And what right, you may ask, has a confessed slaughterer of wild life  such as I have been to complain? None at all, I assure you. I have  twenty-seven guns--and I have used them all. I stand condemned as  having done more than my share toward extermination. But that does not  lessen the fact that I have learned; and in learning I have come to  believe that if boys and girls and men and women could be brought into  the homes and lives of wild birds and animals as their homes are made  and their lives are lived we would all understand at last that wherever  a heart beats it is very much like our own in the final analysis of  things. To see a bird singing on a twig means but little; but to live a  season with that bird, to be with it in courting days, in matehood and  motherhood, to understand its griefs as well as its gladness means a  great deal. And in my books it is my desire to tell of the lives of the  wild things which I know as they are actually lived. It is not my  desire to humanize them. If we are to love wild animals so much that we  do not want to kill them we MUST KNOW THEM AS THEY ACTUALLY LIVE. And  in their lives, in the facts of their lives, there is so much of real  and honest romance and tragedy, so much that makes them akin to  ourselves that the animal biographer need not step aside from the paths  of actuality to hold one's interest.    Perhaps rather tediously I have come to the few words I want to say  about Baree, the hero of this book. Baree, after all, is only another  Kazan. For it was Kazan I found in the way I have described--a bad dog,  a killer about to be shot to death by his master when chance, and my  own faith in him, gave him to me.    We traveled together for many thousands of miles through the  northland--on trails to the Barren Lands, to Hudson's Bay and to the  Arctic. Kazan--the bad dog, the half-wolf, the killer--was the best  four-legged friend I ever had. He died near Fort MacPherson, on the  Peel River, and is buried there. And Kazan was the father of Baree;  Gray Wolf, the full-blooded wolf, was his mother. Nepeese, the Willow,  still lives near God's Lake; and it was in the country of Nepeese and  her father that for three lazy months I watched the doings at Beaver  Town, and went on fishing trips with Wakayoo, the bear. Sometimes I  have wondered if old Beaver Tooth himself did not in some way  understand that I had made his colony safe for his people. It was  Pierrot's trapping ground; and to Pierrot--father of Nepeese--I gave my  best rifle on his word that he would not harm my beaver friends for two  years. And the people of Pierrot's breed keep their word. Wakayoo,  Baree's big bear friend, is dead. He was killed as I have described, in  that \"pocket\" among the ridges, while I was on a jaunt to Beaver Town.  We were becoming good friends and I missed him a great deal. The story  of Pierrot and of his princess wife, Wyola, is true; they are buried  side by side under the tall spruce that stood near their cabin.  Pierrot's murderer, instead of dying as I have told it, was killed in  his attempt to escape the Royal Mounted farther west. When I last saw  Baree he was at Lac Seul House, where I was the guest of Mr. William  Patterson, the factor; and the last word I heard from him was through  my good friend Frank Aldous, factor at White Dog Post, who wrote me  only a few weeks ago that he had recently seen Nepeese and Baree and  the husband of Nepeese, and that the happiness he found in their far  wilderness home made him regret that he was a bachelor. I feel sorry  for Aldous. He is a splendid young Englishman, unattached, and some day  I am going to try and marry him off. I have in mind someone at the  present moment--a fox-trapper's daughter up near the Barren, very  pretty, and educated at a missioner's school; and as Aldous is going  with me on my next trip I may have something to say about them in the  book that is to follow \"Baree, Son of Kazan.\"    James Oliver Curwood    Owosso, Michigan        CHAPTER 1    To Baree, for many days after he was born, the world was a vast gloomy  cavern.    During these first days of his life his home was in the heart of a  great windfall where Gray Wolf, his blind mother, had found a safe nest  for his babyhood, and to which Kazan, her mate, came only now and then,  his eyes gleaming like strange balls of greenish fire in the darkness.  It was Kazan's eyes that gave to Baree his first impression of  something existing away from his mother's side, and they brought to him  also his discovery of vision. He could feel, he could smell, he could  hear--but in that black pit under the fallen timber he had never seen  until the eyes came. At first they frightened him; then they puzzled  him, and his fear changed to an immense curiosity. He would be looking  straight at them, when all at once they would disappear. This was when  Kazan turned his head. And then they would flash back at him again out  of the darkness with such startling suddenness that Baree would  involuntarily shrink closer to his mother, who always trembled and  shivered in a strange sort of way when Kazan came in.    Baree, of course, would never know their story. He would never know  that Gray Wolf, his mother, was a full-blooded wolf, and that Kazan,  his father, was a dog. In him nature was already beginning its  wonderful work, but it would never go beyond certain limitations. It  would tell him, in time, that his beautiful wolf mother was blind, but  he would never know of that terrible battle between Gray Wolf and the  lynx in which his mother's sight had been destroyed. Nature could tell  him nothing of Kazan's merciless vengeance, of the wonderful years of  their matehood, of their loyalty, their strange adventures in the great  Canadian wilderness--it could make him only a son of Kazan.    But at first, and for many days, it was all mother. Even after his eyes  had opened wide and he had found his legs so that he could stumble  about a little in the darkness, nothing existed for Baree but his  mother. When he was old enough to be playing with sticks and moss out  in the sunlight, he still did not know what she looked like. But to him  she was big and soft and warm, and she licked his face with her tongue,  and talked to him in a gentle, whimpering way that at last made him  find his own voice in a faint, squeaky yap.    And then came that wonderful day when the greenish balls of fire that  were Kazan's eyes came nearer and nearer, a little at a time, and very  cautiously. Heretofore Gray Wolf had warned him back. To be alone was  the first law of her wild breed during mothering time. A low snarl from  her throat, and Kazan had always stopped. But on this day the snarl did  not come. In Gray Wolf's throat it died away in a low, whimpering  sound. A note of loneliness, of gladness, of a great yearning. \"It is  all right now,\" she was saying to Kazan; and Kazan--pausing for a  moment to make sure--replied with an answering note deep in his throat.    Still slowly, as if not quite sure of what he would find, Kazan came to  them, and Baree snuggled closer to his mother. He heard Kazan as he  dropped down heavily on his belly close to Gray Wolf. He was  unafraid--and mightily curious. And Kazan, too, was curious. He  sniffed. In the gloom his ears were alert. After a little Baree began  to move. An inch at a time he dragged himself away from Gray Wolf's  side. Every muscle in her lithe body tensed. Again her wolf blood was  warning her. There was danger for Baree. Her lips drew back, baring her  fangs. Her throat trembled, but the note in it never came. Out of the  darkness two yards away came a soft, puppyish whine, and the caressing  sound of Kazan's tongue.    Baree had felt the thrill of his first great adventure. He had  discovered his father.    This all happened in the third week of Baree's life. He was just  eighteen days old when Gray Wolf allowed Kazan to make the acquaintance  of his son. If it had not been for Gray Wolf's blindness and the memory  of that day on the Sun Rock when the lynx had destroyed her eyes, she  would have given birth to Baree in the open, and his legs would have  been quite strong. He would have known the sun and the moon and the  stars; he would have realized what the thunder meant, and would have  seen the lightning flashing in the sky. But as it was, there had been  nothing for him to do in that black cavern under the windfall but  stumble about a little in the darkness, and lick with his tiny red  tongue the raw bones that were strewn about them. Many times he had  been left alone. He had heard his mother come and go, and nearly always  it had been in response to a yelp from Kazan that came to them like a  distant echo. He had never felt a very strong desire to follow until  this day when Kazan's big, cool tongue caressed his face. In those  wonderful seconds nature was at work.

SEVENTH BOOK OF THE    FAITH-PROMOTING SERIES.    Designed for the Instruction and Encouragement of Young Latter-day  Saints.    JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE.    Salt Lake City,    1882.        PREFACE    No apology is necessary for publishing as a volume of the  \"FAITH-PROMOTING SERIES\" some portion of the history of the late  President Heber C. Kimball. Knowing the estimation in which he was  held while living by the Latter day Saints universally, and that the  memory of his virtues and life-long devotion to the cause of God is  still fresh in their hearts, we feel assured that they will regard as  an acceptable offering the brief account of his experience contained  in this volume. We only regret that we cannot in the present work give  a sketch of his entire life, or at least all of those incidents from  it which would tend to promote faith in young readers. His was an  exceedingly active and interesting life, and it is scarcely necessary  to state that the sketch here published, covering a period of only  a little over four years, contains but a fraction of that which is  interesting and wonderful in his life's experience. However, what is  here given will doubtless convey many valuable lessons to those who  read it, and will serve to indicate the character of the great man of  whom it treats.    Heber Chase Kimball was one of the greatest men of this age. There was  a certain nobility about his appearance as well as his disposition that  would have made him conspicuous in any community, and the Church of  Jesus Christ afforded ample scope for the exercise of his ability, and  the trying scenes through which he passed called into play his best  powers.    He was a man of commanding presence, with eyes so keen as to almost  pierce one through, and before which the guilty involuntarily quailed.  He was fearless and powerful in rebuking the wrong-doer, but kind,  benevolent and fatherly to the deserving. He possessed such wonderful  control over the passions of men, combined with such wisdom and  diplomacy that the Prophet Joseph Smith called him \"the peace-maker.\"  His great faith, zeal, earnestness, devotion to principle, cheerfulness  under the most trying circumstances, energy, perseverance and honest  simplicity marked him as no ordinary man. He possessed great natural  force and strong will power, yet in his submission to the Priesthood  and obedience to the laws of God he set a pattern to the whole Church.  His example throughout life was one of which his posterity may ever  think with pride, and which the Saints generally will do well to follow.    No man, perhaps, Joseph Smith excepted, who has belonged to the  Church in this generation, ever possessed the gift of prophecy to a  greater degree than Brother Kimball. Although not at all pretentious,  he was somewhat celebrated among his acquaintances for his prophetic  inspiration. The prediction which he made soon after the arrival of  the Pioneers in Salt Lake Valley, that the destitute Saints would soon  be supplied with clothing, and that \"States goods\" would be sold in  Salt Lake City as cheap as in New York, seemed most unreasonable at  the time it was uttered. Its fulfillment, however, by the unexpected  influx of gold-seekers, making their way to California, and anxious to  lighten their loads by selling their goods at almost any price, is now  a matter of history. Scores of other predictions were made by him and  as literally fulfilled.    Brother Kimball was the only one of his father's family who embraced  the gospel, but now his is one of the most numerous families in the  Church. At the time of his death, which occurred June 22, 1868, he was  the father of sixty-five children, of whom thirty males and eleven  females were then living. His direct descendants now number one hundred  and seventy-two.    The first ten chapters of this work were formerly published in pamphlet  form by Elder R. B. Thompson in Nauvoo. Only a small edition, however,  was printed, and it has now been out of print for a great many years.  The next six chapters have been compiled from the manuscript history of  Elder Kimball by his eldest daughter, Sister Helen Mar Whitney, to whom  we are also indebted for the items contained in his letters from which  the last chapter was written.

CALLED TO GO UPON A MISSION TO ENGLAND--APPOINTED TO PRESIDE--THE  JOURNEY.    The labors of the Elders of the Church of Latter-day Saints in early  days were confined to the United States of America, with the exception  of the province of Upper Canada, where a great many persons embraced  the gospel of Jesus Christ, and rejoiced in the blessings thereof. The  majority of this latter class were originally from Great Britain, and  they soon began to manifest a desire that their relatives and friends  who were still residing there, might be privileged with hearing the  glad tidings of salvation, and be made partakers of those gifts and  blessings which are promised in obedience thereto. For the attainment  of this object, "]]]
