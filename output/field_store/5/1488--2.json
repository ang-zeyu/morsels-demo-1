The aboriginal composition now presented to the public has some peculiar  claims on the attention of scholars. As a record, if we accept the  chronology of its custodians,--which there is no reason to question,--it  carries back the authentic history of Northern America to a date  anterior by fifty years to the arrival of Columbus. Further than this,  the plain and credible tradition of the Iroquois, confirmed by much  other evidence, links them with the still earlier Alligewi, or  \"Moundbuilders,\" as conquerors with the conquered. Thus the annals of  this portion of the continent need no longer begin with the landing of  the first colonists, but can go back, like those of Mexico, Yucatan and  Peru, to a storied past of singular interest.    The chief value of the Book of Rites, however, is ethnological, and is  found in the light which it casts on the political and social life, as  well as on the character and capacity of the people to whom it belongs.  We see in them many of the traits which Tacitus discerned in our  ancestors of the German forests, along with some qualities of a higher  cast than any that he has delineated. The love of peace, the sentiment  of human brotherhood, the strong social and domestic affections, the  respect for law, and the reverence for ancestral greatness, which are  apparent in this Indian record and in the historical events which  illustrate it, will strike most readers as new and unexpected  developments.    The circumstances attending the composition of this record and its  recent discovery are fully detailed in the introductory chapters. There  also, and in the Notes and Appendix, such further explanations are given  as the various allusions and occasional obscurities of the Indian work  have seemed to require. It is proper to state that the particulars  comprised in the following pages respecting the traditions, the usages,  and the language of the Iroquois (except such as are expressly stated to  have been derived from books), have been gathered by the writer in the  course of many visits made, during several years past, to their  Reservations in Canada and New York. As a matter of justice, and also as  an evidence of the authenticity of these particulars, the names of the  informants to whom he has been principally indebted are given in the  proper places, with suitable acknowledgment of the assistance received  from each. He ventures to hope that in the information thus obtained, as  well as in the Book of Rite's itself, the students of history and of the  science of man will find some new material of permanent interest and  value.

A.D. 1535 TO 1780.]            INTRODUCTION.          CHAPTER I.    THE HURON-IROQUOIS NATIONS.      At the outset of the sixteenth century, when the five tribes or  \"nations\" of the Iroquois confederacy first became known to European  explorers, they were found occupying the valleys and uplands of northern  New York, in that picturesque and fruitful region which stretches  westward from the head-waters of the Hudson to the Genesee. The Mohawks,  or Caniengas--as they should properly be called--possessed the Mohawk  River, and covered Lake George and Lake Champlain with their flotillas  of large canoes, managed with the boldness and skill which, hereditary  in their descendants, make them still the best boatmen of the North  American rivers. West of the Caniengas the Oneidas held the small river  and lake which bear their name, the first in that series of beautiful  lakes, united by interlacing streams, which seemed to prefigure in the  features of nature the political constitution of the tribes who  possessed them. West of the Oneidas, the imperious Onondagas, the  central and, in some respects, the ruling nation of the League,  possessed the two lakes of Onondaga and Skeneateles, together with the  common outlet of this inland lake system, the Oswego River, to its issue  into Lake Ontario. Still proceeding westward, the lines of trail and  river led to the long and winding stretch of Lake Cayuga, about which  were clustered the towns of the people who gave their name to the lake;  and beyond them, over the wide expanse of hills and dales surrounding  Lakes Seneca and Canandaigua, were scattered the populous villages of  the Senecas, more correctly styled Sonontowanas or Mountaineers. Such  were the names and abodes of the allied nations, members of the  far-famed Kanonsionni, or League of United Households, who were destined  to become for a time the most notable and powerful community among the  native tribes of North America. [Footnote: See Appendix, note A, for the  origin and meaning of the names commonly given to the Iroquois nations.]    The region which has been described was not, however, the original seat  of those nations. They belonged to that linguistic family which is known  to ethnologists as the Huron-Iroquois stock. This stock comprised the  Hurons or Wyandots, the Attiwandaronks or Neutral Nation, the Iroquois,  the Eries, the Andastes or Conestogas, the Tuscaroras, and some smaller  bands. The tribes of this family occupied a long, irregular area of  inland territory, stretching from Canada to North Carolina. The northern  nations were all clustered about the great lakes; the southern bands  held the fertile valleys bordering the head-waters of the rivers which  flowed from the Allegheny mountains. The languages of all these tribes  showed a close affinity. There can be no doubt that their ancestors  formed one body, and, indeed, dwelt at one time (as has been well said  of the ancestors of the Indo-European populations), under one roof.  There was a Huron-Iroquois \"family-pair,\" from which all these tribes  were descended. In what part of the world this ancestral household  resided is a question which admits of no reply, except from the merest  conjecture. But the evidence of language, so far as it has yet been  examined, seems to show that the Huron clans were the older members of  the group; and the clear and positive traditions of all the surviving  tribes, Hurons, Iroquois and Tuscaroras, point to the lower St. Lawrence  as the earliest known abode of their stock. [Footnote: See Cusick,  _History of the Six Nations_, p. 16; Colden, _Hist, of the Five  Nations_, p. 23; Morgan, _League of the Iroquois_, p. 5; J.V.H. Clark,  _Onondaga_, vol. I, p. 34; Peter D. Clarke, _Hist. of the Wyandots_. p.  I.]    Here the first explorer, Cartier, found Indians of this stock at  Hochelaga and Stadacone, now the sites of Montreal and Quebec. Centuries  before his time, according to the native tradition, the ancestors of the  Huron-Iroquois family had dwelt in this locality, or still further east  and nearer to the river's mouth. As their numbers increased, dissensions  arose. The hive swarmed, and band after band moved off to the west and  south.    As they spread, they encountered people of other stocks, with whom they  had frequent wars. Their most constant and most dreaded enemies were the  tribes of the Algonkin family, a fierce and restless people, of northern  origin, who everywhere surrounded them. At one period, however, if the  concurrent traditions of both Iroquois and Algonkins can be believed,  these contending races for a time stayed their strife, and united their  forces in an alliance against a common and formidable foe. This foe was  the nation, or perhaps the confederacy, of the Alligewi or Talligewi,  the semi-civilized \"Mound-builders\" of the Ohio Valley, who have left  their name to the Allegheny river and mountains, and whose vast  earthworks are still, after half-a-century of study, the perplexity of  archaeologists. A desperate warfare ensued, which lasted about a hundred  years, and ended in the complete overthrow and destruction, or  expulsion, of the Alligewi. The survivors of the conquered people fled  southward, and are supposed to have mingled with the tribes which  occupied the region extending from the Gulf of Mexico northward to the  Tennessee river and the southern spurs of the Alleghenies. Among these  tribes, the Choctaws retained, to recent times, the custom of raising  huge mounds of earth for religious purposes and for the sites of their  habitations, a custom which they perhaps learned from the Alligewi; and  the Cherokees are supposed by some to have preserved in their name  (Tsalaki) and in their language indications of an origin derived in part  from the same people. Their language, which shows, in its grammar and  many of its words, clear evidence of affinity with the Iroquois, has  drawn the greater portion of its vocabulary from some foreign source.  This source is conjectured to have been the speech of the Alligewi.

Blavatsky)      [Dedicated by the Translator to those sceptics who clamour so  loudly, both in print and private letters--\"Show us the  wonder-working 'Brothers,' let them come out publicly--and we will  believe in them!\"]      [The following is an extract from M. Dostoevsky's celebrated  novel, The Brothers Karamazof, the last publication from the pen  of the great Russian novelist, who died a few months ago, just as  the concluding chapters appeared in print. Dostoevsky is  beginning to be recognized as one of the ablest and profoundest  among Russian writers. His characters are invariably typical  portraits drawn from various classes of Russian society,  strikingly life-like and realistic to the highest degree. The  following extract is a cutting satire on modern theology  generally and the Roman Catholic religion in particular. The idea  is that Christ revisits earth, coming to Spain at the period of  the Inquisition, and is at once arrested as a heretic by the  Grand Inquisitor. One of the three brothers of the story, Ivan, a  rank materialist and an atheist of the new school, is supposed to  throw this conception into the form of a poem, which he describes  to Alyosha--the youngest of the brothers, a young Christian  mystic brought up by a \"saint\" in a monastery--as follows:  (--Ed. Theosophist, Nov., 1881)]            \"Quite impossible, as you see, to start without an introduction,\"  laughed Ivan. \"Well, then, I mean to place the event described in  the poem in the sixteenth century, an age--as you must have been  told at school--when it was the great fashion among poets to  make the denizens and powers of higher worlds descend on earth  and mix freely with mortals... In France all the notaries'  clerks, and the monks in the cloisters as well, used to give  grand performances, dramatic plays in which long scenes were  enacted by the Madonna, the angels, the saints, Christ, and even  by God Himself. In those days, everything was very artless and  primitive. An instance of it may be found in Victor Hugo's drama,  Notre Dame de Paris, where, at the Municipal Hall, a play called  Le Bon Jugement de la Tres-sainte et Gracieuse Vierge Marie, is  enacted in honour of Louis XI, in which the Virgin appears  personally to pronounce her 'good judgment.' In Moscow, during  the prepetrean period, performances of nearly the same character,  chosen especially from the Old Testament, were also in great  favour. Apart from such plays, the world was overflooded with  mystical writings, 'verses'--the heroes of which were always  selected from the ranks of angels, saints and other heavenly  citizens answering to the devotional purposes of the age. The  recluses of our monasteries, like the Roman Catholic monks,  passed their time in translating, copying, and even producing  original compositions upon such subjects, and that, remember,  during the Tarter period!... In this connection, I am reminded of  a poem compiled in a convent--a translation from the Greek, of  course--called, 'The Travels of the Mother of God among the  Damned,' with fitting illustrations and a boldness of conception  inferior nowise to that of Dante. The 'Mother of God' visits  hell, in company with the archangel Michael as her cicerone to  guide her through the legions of the 'damned.' She sees them all,  and is witness to their multifarious tortures. Among the many  other exceedingly remarkably varieties of torments--every  category of sinners having its own--there  is one especially  worthy of notice, namely a class of the 'damned' sentenced to  gradually sink in a burning lake of brimstone and fire. Those  whose sins cause them to sink so low that they no longer can rise  to the surface are for ever forgotten by God, i.e., they fade out  from the omniscient memory, says the poem--an expression, by the  way, of an extraordinary profundity of thought, when closely  analysed. The Virgin is terribly shocked, and falling down upon  her knees in tears before the throne of God, begs that all she  has seen in hell--all, all without exception, should have their  sentences remitted to them. Her dialogue with God is colossally  interesting. She supplicates, she will not leave Him. And when  God, pointing to the pierced hands and feet of her Son, cries,  'How can I forgive His executioners?' She then commands that all  the saints, martyrs, angels and archangels, should prostrate  themselves with her before the Immutable and Changeless One and  implore Him to change His wrath into mercy and--forgive them  all. The poem closes upon her obtaining from God a compromise, a  kind of yearly respite of tortures between Good Friday and  Trinity, a chorus of the 'damned' singing loud praises to God  from their 'bottomless pit,' thanking and telling Him:      Thou art right, O Lord, very right,    Thou hast condemned us justly.    \"My poem is of the same character.    \"In it, it is Christ who appears on the scene. True, He says  nothing, but only appears and passes out of sight. Fifteen  centuries have elapsed since He left the world with the distinct  promise to return 'with power and great glory'; fifteen long  centuries since His prophet cried, 'Prepare ye the way of the  Lord!' since He Himself had foretold, while yet on earth, 'Of  that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven  but my Father only.' But Christendom expects Him still. ...    \"It waits for Him with the same old faith and the same emotion;  aye, with a far greater faith, for fifteen centuries have rolled  away since the last sign from heaven was sent to man,      And blind faith remained alone    To lull the trusting heart,    As heav'n would send a sign no more.    \"True, again, we have all heard of miracles being wrought ever  since the 'age of miracles' passed away to return no more. We  had, and still have, our saints credited with performing the most  miraculous cures; and, if we can believe their biographers, there  have been those among them who have been personally visited by  the Queen of Heaven. But Satan sleepeth not, and the first germs  of doubt, and ever-increasing unbelief in such wonders, already  had begun to sprout in Christendom as early as the sixteenth  century. It was just at that time that a new and terrible heresy  first made its appearance in the north of Germany.*   [*Luther's  reform]  A great star 'shining as it were a lamp... fell upon the  fountains waters'... and 'they were made bitter.' This 'heresy'  blasphemously denied 'miracles.' But those who had remained  faithful believed all the more ardently, the tears of mankind  ascended to Him as heretofore, and the Christian world was  expecting Him as confidently as ever; they loved Him and hoped in  Him, thirsted and hungered to suffer and die for Him just as many  of them had done before.... So many centuries had weak, trusting  humanity implored Him, crying with ardent faith and fervour: 'How  long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not come!' So many long  centuries hath it vainly appealed to Him, that at last, in His  inexhaustible compassion, He consenteth to answer the prayer....  He decideth that once more, if it were but for one short hour,  the people--His long-suffering, tortured, fatally sinful, his  loving and child-like, trusting people--shall behold Him again.  The scene of action is placed by me in Spain, at Seville, during  that terrible period of the Inquisition, when, for the greater  glory of God, stakes were flaming all over the country.      Burning wicked heretics,    In grand auto-da-fes.    \"This particular visit has, of course, nothing to do with the  promised Advent, when, according to the programme, 'after the  tribulation of those days,' He will appear 'coming in the clouds  of heaven.' For, that 'coming of the Son of Man,' as we are  informed, will take place as suddenly 'as the lightning cometh  out of the east and shineth even unto the west.' No; this once,  He desired to come unknown, and appear among His children, just  when the bones of the heretics, sentenced to be burnt alive, had  commenced crackling at the flaming stakes. Owing to His limitless  mercy, He mixes once more with mortals and in the same form in  which He was wont to appear fifteen centuries ago. He descends,  just at the very moment when before king, courtiers, knights,  cardinals, and the fairest dames of court, before the whole  population of Seville, upwards of a hundred wicked heretics are  being roasted, in a magnificent auto-da-fe ad majorem Dei  gloriam, by the order of the powerful Cardinal Grand Inquisitor.    \"He comes silently and unannounced; yet all--how strange--yea,  all recognize Him, at once! The population rushes towards Him as  if propelled by some irresistible force; it surrounds, throngs,  and presses around, it follows Him.... Silently, and with a smile  of boundless compassion upon His lips, He crosses the dense  crowd, and moves softly on. The Sun of Love burns in His heart,  and warm rays of Light, Wisdom and Power beam forth from His  eyes, and pour down their waves upon the swarming multitudes of  the rabble assembled around, making their hearts vibrate with  returning love. He extends His hands over their heads, blesses  them, and from mere contact with Him, aye, even with His  garments, a healing power goes forth. An old man, blind from his  birth, cries, 'Lord, heal me, that I may see Thee!' and the  scales falling off the closed eyes, the blind man beholds Him...  The crowd weeps for joy, and kisses the ground upon which He  treads. Children strew flowers along His path and sing to Him,  'Hosanna!' It is He, it is Himself, they say to each other, it  must be He, it can be none other but He! He pauses at the portal  of the old cathedral, just as a wee white coffin is carried in,  with tears and great lamentations. The lid is off, and in the  coffin lies the body of a fair-child, seven years old, the"]]]
