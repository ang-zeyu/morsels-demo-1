A GUIDE TO STOICISM    by St. George Stock        TEN CENT POCKET SERIES NO. 347    Edited by E. Haldeman-Julius.        FOREWORD    If you strip Stoicism of its paradoxes and its wilful misuse of  language, what is left is simply the moral philosophy of Socrates,  Plato and Aristotle, dashed with the physics of Heraclitus. Stoicism  was not so much a new doctrine as the form under which the old Greek  philosophy finally presented itself to the world at large. It owed  its popularity in some measure to its extravagance. A great deal  might be said about Stoicism as a religion and about the part it  played in the formation of Christianity but these subjects were  excluded by the plan of this volume which was to present a sketch of  the Stoic doctrine based on the original authorities.        ST GEORGE STOCK M A          _Pemb. Coll. Oxford_               A GUIDE TO STOICISM.             ST GEORGE STOCK      PHILOSOPHY AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS.    Among the Greeks and Romans of the classical age philosophy occupied  the place taken by religion among ourselves. Their appeal was to  reason not to revelation. To what, asks Cicero in his Offices, are we  to look for training in virtue, if not to philosophy? Now, if truth  is believed to rest upon authority it is natural that it should be  impressed upon the mind from the earliest age, since the essential  thing is that it should be believed, but a truth which makes its  appeal to reason must be content to wait till reason is developed. We  are born into the Eastern, Western or Anglican communion or some  other denomination, but it was of his own free choice that the  serious minded young Greek or Roman embraced the tenets of one of the  great sects which divided the world of philosophy. The motive which  led him to do so in the first instance may have been merely the  influence of a friend or a discourse from some eloquent speaker, but  the choice once made was his own choice, and he adhered to it as  such. Conversions from one sect to another were of quite rare  occurrence. A certain Dionysius of Heraclea, who went over from the  Stoics to the Cyrenaics, was ever afterward known as \"the deserter.\"  It was as difficult to be independent in philosophy as it is with us  to be independent in politics. When a young man joined a school, he  committed himself to all its opinions, not only as to the end of  life, which was the main point of division, but as to all questions  on all subjects. The Stoic did not differ merely in his ethics from  the Epicurean; he differed also in his theology and his physics and  his metaphysics. Aristotle, as Shakespeare knew, thought young men  \"unfit to hear moral philosophy\". And yet it was a question--or  rather the question--of moral philosophy, the answer to which decided  the young man's opinions on all other points. The language which  Cicero sometimes uses about the seriousness of the choice made in  early life and how a young man gets entrammelled by a school before  he is really able to judge, reminds us of what we hear said nowadays  about the danger of a young man's taking orders before his opinions  are formed. To this it was replied that a young man only exercised  the right of private judgment in selecting the authority whom he  should follow, and, having once done that, trusted to him for all the  rest. With the analogue of this contention also we are familiar in  modern times. Cicero allows that there would be something in it, if  the selection of the true philosopher did not above all things  require the philosophic mind. But in those days it was probably the  case, as it is now, that, if a man did not form speculative opinions  in youth, the pressure of affairs would not leave him leisure to do  so later.    The life span of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, was from B.C. 347 to  275. He did not begin teaching till 315, at the mature age of forty.  Aristotle had passed away in 322, and with him closed the great  constructive era of Greek thought. The Ionian philosophers had  speculated on the physical constitution of the universe, the  Pythagoreans on the mystical properties of numbers; Heraclitus had  propounded his philosophy of fire, Democritus and Leucippus had  struck out a rude form of the atomic theory, Socrates had raised  questions relating to man, Plato had discussed them with all the  freedom of the dialogue, while Aristotle had systematically worked  them out. The later schools did not add much to the body of  philosophy. What they did was to emphasize different sides of the  doctrine of their predecessors and to drive views to their logical  consequences. The great lesson of Greek philosophy is that it is  worth while to do right irrespective of reward and punishment and  regardless of the shortness of life. This lesson the Stoics so  enforced by the earnestness of their lives and the influence of their  moral teaching that it has become associated more particularly with  them. Cicero, though he always classed himself as an Academic,  exclaims in one place that he is afraid the Stoics are the only  philosophers, and whenever he is combating Epicureanism his language  is that of a Stoic. Some of Vergil's most eloquent passages seem to  be inspired by Stoic speculation. Even Horace, despite his banter  about the sage, in his serious moods borrows the language of the  Stoics. It was they who inspired the highest flights of declamatory  eloquence in Persius and Juvenal. Their moral philosophy affected the  world through Roman law, the great masters of which were brought up  under its influence. So all pervasive indeed was this moral  philosophy of the Stoics that it was read by the Jews of Alexandria  into Moses under the veil of allegory and was declared to be the  inner meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures. If the Stoics then did not  add much to the body of Philosophy, they did a great work in  popularising it and bringing it to bear upon life.    An intense practicality was a mark of the later Greek philosophy.  This was common to Stoicism with its rival Epicureanism. Both  regarded philosophy as 'the art of life,' though they differed in  their conception of what that art should be. Widely as the two  schools were opposed to one another, they had also other features in  common. Both were children of an age in which the free city had given  way to monarchies, and personal had taken the place of corporate  life. The question of happiness is no longer, as with Aristotle, and  still more with Plato, one for the state, but for the individual. In  both schools the speculative interest was feeble from the first, and  tended to become feebler as time went on. Both were new departures  from pre-existent schools. Stoicism was bred out of Cynicism, as  Epicureanism out of Cyrenaicism. Both were content to fall back for  their physics upon the pre-Socratic schools, the one adopting the  firm philosophy of Heraclitus, the other the atomic theory of  Democritus. Both were in strong reaction against the abstractions of  Plato and Aristotle, and would tolerate nothing but concrete reality.  The Stoics were quite as materialistic in their own way as the  Epicureans. With regard indeed to the nature of the highest god we  may, with Senaca represent the difference between the two schools as  a question of the senses against the intellect, but we shall see  presently that the Stoics regarded the intellect itself as being a  kind of body.    The Greeks were all agreed that there was an end or aim of life, and  that it was to be called 'happiness,' but at that point their  agreement ended. As to the nature of happiness there was the utmost  variety of opinion. Democritus had made it consist in mental  serenity, Anaxagoras in speculation, Socrates in wisdom, Aristotle in  the practise of virtue with some amount of favour from fortune,  Aristippus simply in pleasure. These were opinions of the  philosophers. But, besides these, there were the opinions of ordinary  men, as shown by their lives rather than by their language. Zeno's  contribution to thought on the subject does not at first sight appear  illuminating. He said that the end was 'to live consistently,' the  implication doubtless being that no life but the passionless life of  reason could ultimately be consistent with itself. Cleanthes, his  immediate successor in the school, is credited with having added the  words 'with nature,' thus completing the well-known Stoic formula  that the end is 'to live consistently with nature.'    It was assumed by the Greeks that the ways of nature were 'the ways  of pleasantness,' and that 'all her paths' were 'peace.' This may  seem to us a startling assumption, but that is because we do not mean  by 'nature' the same thing as they did. We connect the term with the  origin of a thing, they connected it rather with the end; by the  'natural state' we mean a state of savagery, they meant the highest  civilization; we mean by a thing's nature what it is or has been,  they meant what it ought to become under the most favourable  conditions; not the sour crab, but the mellow glory of the Hesperides  worthy to be guarded by a sleepless dragon, was to the Greeks the  natural apple. Hence we find Aristotle maintaining that the State is  a natural product, because it is evolved out of social relations  which exist by nature. Nature indeed was a highly ambiguous term to  the Greeks no less than to ourselves, but in the sense with which we  are now concerned, the nature of anything was defined by the  Peripatetics as 'the end of its becoming.' Another definition of  theirs puts the matter still more clearly. 'What each thing is when  its growth has been completed, that we declare to be the nature of  each thing'.    Following out this conception the Stoics identified a life in  accordance with nature with a life in accordance with the highest  perfection to which man could attain.

THE OXFORD TRANSLATION REVISED, WITH NOTES.    By Tacitus    With An Introduction By Edward Brooks, Jr.          INTRODUCTION.      Very little is known concerning the life of Tacitus, the historian,  except that which he tells us in his own writings and those incidents  which are related of him by his contemporary, Pliny.    His full name was Caius Cornelius Tacitus. The date of his birth can  only be arrived at by conjecture, and then only approximately. The  younger Pliny speaks of him as _prope modum aequales_, about the same  age. Pliny was born in 61. Tacitus, however, occupied the office of  quaestor under Vespasian in 78 A.D., at which time he must, therefore,  have been at least twenty-five years of age. This would fix the date of  his birth not later than 53 A.D. It is probable, therefore, that Tacitus  was Pliny's senior by several years.    His parentage is also a matter of pure conjecture. The name Cornelius  was a common one among the Romans, so that from it we can draw no  inference. The fact that at an early age he occupied a prominent  public office indicates that he was born of good family, and it is not  impossible that his father was a certain Cornelius Tacitus, a Roman  knight, who was procurator in Belgic Gaul, and whom the elder Pliny  speaks of in his \"Natural History.\"    Of the early life of Tacitus and the training which he underwent  preparatory to those literary efforts which afterwards rendered him a  conspicuous figure among Roman literateurs we know absolutely nothing.    Of the events of his life which transpired after he attained man's  estate we know but little beyond that which he himself has recorded in  his writings. He occupied a position of some eminence as a pleader at  the Roman bar, and in 77 A.D. married the daughter of Julius Agricola,  a humane and honorable citizen, who was at that time consul and was  subsequently appointed governor of Britain. It is quite possible that  this very advantageous alliance hastened his promotion to the office of  quaestor under Vespasian.    Under Domitian, in 88, Tacitus was appointed one of fifteen  commissioners to preside at the celebration of the secular games. In the  same year he held the office of praetor, and was a member of one of the  most select of the old priestly colleges, in which a pre-requisite of  membership was that a man should be born of a good family.    The following year he appears to have left Rome, and it is possible  that he visited Germany and there obtained his knowledge and information  respecting the manners and customs of its people which he makes the  subject of his work known as the \"Germany.\"    He did not return to Rome until 93, after an absence of four years,  during which time his father-in-law died.    Some time between the years 93 and 97 he was elected to the senate, and  during this time witnessed the judicial murders of many of Rome's best  citizens which were perpetrated under the reign of Nero. Being himself a  senator, he felt that he was not entirely guiltless of the crimes which  were committed, and in his \"Agricola\" we find him giving expression to  this feeling in the following words: \"Our own hands dragged Helvidius  to prison; ourselves were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and  Rusticus, and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio.\"    In 97 he was elected to the consulship as successor to Virginius  Rufus, who died during his term of office and at whose funeral Tacitus  delivered an oration in such a manner to cause Pliny to say, \"The  good fortune of Virginius was crowned by having the most eloquent of  panegyrists.\"    In 99 Tacitus was appointed by the senate, together with Pliny, to  conduct the prosecution against a great political offender, Marius  Priscus, who, as proconsul of Africa, had corruptly mismanaged the  affairs of his province. We have his associate's testimony that Tacitus  made a most eloquent and dignified reply to the arguments which were  urged on the part of the defence. The prosecution was successful, and  both Pliny and Tacitus were awarded a vote of thanks by the senate for  their eminent and effectual efforts in the management of the case.    The exact date of Tacitus's death is not known, but in his \"Annals\"  he seems to hint at the successful extension of the Emperor Trajan's  eastern campaigns during the years 115 to 117, so that it is probable  that he lived until the year 117.    Tacitus had a widespread reputation during his lifetime. On one occasion  it is related of him that as he sat in the circus at the celebration of  some games, a Roman knight asked him whether he was from Italy or the  provinces. Tacitus answered, \"You know me from your reading,\" to which  the knight quickly replied, \"Are you then Tacitus or Pliny?\"    It is also worthy of notice that the Emperor Marcus Claudius Tacitus,  who reigned during the third century, claimed to be descended from the  historian, and directed that ten copies of his works should be published  every year and placed in the public libraries.    The list of the extant works of Tacitus is as follows: the \"Germany;\"  the \"Life of Agricola;\" the \"Dialogue on Orators;\" the \"Histories,\" and  the \"Annals.\"    The following pages contain translations of the first two of these  works. The \"Germany,\" the full title of which is \"Concerning the  situation, manners and inhabitants of Germany,\" contains little of value  from a historical standpoint. It describes with vividness the fierce and  independent spirit of the German nations, with many suggestions as to  the dangers in which the empire stood of these people. The \"Agricola\"  is a biographical sketch of the writer's father-in-law, who, as has been  said, was a distinguished man and governor of Britain. It is one of the  author's earliest works and was probably written shortly after the  death of Domitian, in 96. This work, short as it is, has always been  considered an admirable specimen of biography on account of its grace  and dignity of expression. Whatever else it may be, it is a graceful and  affectionate tribute to an upright and excellent man.    The \"Dialogue on Orators\" treats of the decay of eloquence under the  empire. It is in the form of a dialogue, and represents two eminent  members of the Roman bar discussing the change for the worse that had  taken place in the early education of the Roman youth.    The \"Histories\" relate the events which transpired in Rome, beginning  with the ascession of Galba, in 68, and ending with the reign of  Domitian, in 97. Only four books and a fragment of a fifth have been  preserved to us. These books contain an account of the brief reigns of  Galba, Otho and Vitellius. The portion of the fifth book which has been  preserved contains an interesting, though rather biased, account of the  character, customs and religion of the Jewish nation viewed from the  standpoint of a cultivated citizen of Rome.    The \"Annals\" contain the history of the empire from the death of  Augustus, in 14, to the death of Nero, in 68, and originally consisted  of sixteen books. Of these, only nine have come down to us in a state  of entire preservation, and of the other seven we have but fragments of  three. Out of a period of fifty-four years we have the history of about  forty.    The style of Tacitus is, perhaps, noted principally for its conciseness.  Tacitean brevity is proverbial, and many of his sentences are so brief,  and leave so much for the student to read between the lines, that in  order to be understood and appreciated the author must be read over and  over again, lest the reader miss the point of some of his most  excellent thoughts. Such an author presents grave, if not insuperable,  difficulties to the translator, but notwithstanding this fact, the  following pages cannot but impress the reader with the genius of  Tacitus.          A TREATISE ON THE SITUATION, MANNERS AND INHABITANTS OF GERMANY. [1]      1. Germany [2] is separated from Gaul, Rhaetia, [3] and Pannonia, [4] by  the rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia, by mountains [5]  and mutual dread. The rest is surrounded by an ocean, embracing broad  promontories [6] and vast insular tracts, [7] in which our military  expeditions have lately discovered various nations and kingdoms. The  Rhine, issuing from the inaccessible and precipitous summit of the  Rhaetic Alps, [8] bends gently to the west, and falls into the Northern  Ocean. The Danube, poured from the easy and gently raised ridge of Mount  Abnoba, [9] visits several nations in its course, till at length it  bursts out [10] by six channels [11] into the Pontic sea; a seventh is  lost in marshes.    2. The people of Germany appear to me indigenous, [12] and free from  intermixture with foreigners, either as settlers or casual visitants.  For the emigrants of former ages performed their expeditions not by  land, but by water; [13] and that immense, and, if I may so call it,  hostile ocean, is rarely navigated by ships from our world. [14] Then,  besides the danger of a boisterous and unknown sea, who would relinquish  Asia, Africa, or Italy, for Germany, a land rude in its surface,  rigorous in its climate, cheerless to every beholder and cultivator,  except a native? In their ancient songs, [15] which are their only  records or annals, they celebrate the god Tuisto, [16] sprung from the  earth, and his son Mannus, as the fathers and founders of their race.  To Mannus they ascribe three sons, from whose names [17] the people  bordering on the ocean are called Ingaevones; those inhabiting the  central parts, Herminones; the rest, Istaevones. Some, [18] however,  assuming the licence of antiquity, affirm that there were more  descendants of the god, from whom more appellations were derived; as  those of the Marsi, [19] Gambrivii, [20] Suevi, [21] and Vandali; [22]"]]]
