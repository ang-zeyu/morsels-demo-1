AMONG MALAY PIRATES          CHAPTER I.      \"I wish most heartily that something would happen,\" Harry Parkhurst,  a midshipman of some sixteen years of age, said to his chum, Dick  Balderson, as they leaned on the rail of her majesty's gunboat Serpent,  and looked gloomily at the turbid stream that rolled past the ship as  she lay at anchor.    \"One day is just like another--one is in a state of perspiration from  morning till night, and from night till morning. There seems to be  always a mist upon the water; and if it were not that we get up steam  every three or four days and run out for twenty-four hours for a breath  of fresh air, I believe that we should be all eaten up with fever in no  time. Of course, they are always talking of Malay pirates up the river  kicking up a row; but it never seems to come off.\"    \"There is one thing, Harry--there is always something to look at, for  there are canoes constantly going up and down, and there is plenty  of variety among them--from the sluggish dhows, laden with up  country produce, to the long canoes with a score of paddlers and some  picturesque ruffian sitting in the stern. It adds to the interest when  you know that the crews are cutthroats to a man, and would make but the  shortest possible work of you if they had got you in their power.\"    \"Yes, Dick. Look at that canoe coming up stream; what a good looking  chap that is in the stern, though by the way he scowls at us I can quite  believe he would, as you say, cut our throats if he had the chance. That  is a pretty little child sitting by him, and what a gorgeous dress she  has! There, you see, he can look pleasant enough when he speaks to her.  I fancy they must have come from a long way up the river, for they  look wilder than most of the fellows who pass us. If that fool who is  steering her does not mind what he is about, Dick, he will either run  into that canoe coming down or else get across our chain. There, I told  you so.\"    The man at the tiller was in fact, looking, with mingled curiosity and  hostility, at the gunboat that he was passing but a few yards away, and  did not notice a canoe, manned by six rowers, that was coming down with  the stream, taking an oblique course across the bows of the Serpent, and  was indeed hidden from his view by the hull of the vessel, until he had  passed beyond her. Then there was a sudden shout and a yell from a dozen  throats, as the two canoes came into collision, the one proceeding up  the river being struck on the quarter with a force that almost cut her  in two, and in an instant her occupants were in the water. As the  Malays were to a man almost as much at home in the water as on land, the  accident would have had little effect beyond the loss of the boat and  its contents, had it not been that the stern of the other craft struck  the Malay chief with such force as to completely disable him, and he  would have sunk at once had not two of the boatmen grasped him and kept  his head above water.    \"What has become of the child?\" Harry Parkhurst exclaimed, and he and  Dick Balderson both leaped on to the rail, throwing off their jackets  as they shouted to the men to lower a boat. Nothing could be seen of  the child until, after half a minute's suspense, a little face suddenly  appeared in the swirl of the muddy water some fifteen yards from the  vessel's side. It was gone again in an instant, but, as it disappeared,  both lads sprang from the side and with a few strokes reached the spot  where they had seen the face disappear; then they dived under water and  soon grasped her. As soon as they came to the surface a sailor, who had  seized a coil of rope, flung it to them, and, grasping it, they were  quickly by the side of the gunboat.    A minute later some sailors, who had at once tumbled into a boat on the  alarm being given, came up. The child was first handed into it, then the  midshipmen scrambled in, and, by their directions, two of the sailors,  standing on the thwarts, lifted the child high above their heads to the  hands of the men leaning over the bulwark.    \"Take the little thing to the doctor,\" Dick said. \"Now, lads, row on;  let's pick up some of those Malay fellows.\"    A babel of shouts and sounds rose from the water; the bow of the second  canoe had been stove in, and she also had sunk to the water level; a  fierce fight was going on between several of the Malays; the chief,  who was being supported by two of his crew, was shouting furiously; and  others of his men, in obedience to his orders, were diving under water.  Harry turned to the gunboat, and called to the men to bring Soh Hay,  the interpreter, to the side. A minute later the man was hustled to the  rail.    \"Tell that chief that we have got his child safely on board,\" Harry  shouted.    Again and again the interpreter called out; but it was some time before  he could make the chief pay attention to him. As the latter caught the  purport of his words his face changed at once, and, after calling to his  men to desist from their search, his head sank on to the shoulder of one  of the men supporting him, and he evidently lost consciousness.    \"He is badly hurt, Dick; we had better get him on board, too. Old  Horsley was wishing this morning that he had something to do beyond  administering doses of quinine to the men.\"    Taking the tiller, he brought the boat alongside the chief, and four of  the sailors, directed by Dick, gently raised him from the water and laid  him on the bottom of the boat. Blood was flowing freely from an ugly  gash in his face, and it was evident from the manner in which his left  arm hung limp, as they lifted him up, that either the shoulder or the  arm itself was broken.    \"Get him alongside at once, lads,\" Dick said. \"I expect he is more  injured than we see. The other fellows will be all right; they can all  swim like fish.\"    In two or three minutes the injured man was laid down under an awning  over the fore deck of the cruiser, and the surgeon at once came up.    \"How is the child, Doctor?\"    \"She is still insensible,\" he said, \"but she will soon be all right. I  can't discover any injury, and I think it likely that it was the sudden  shock, and perhaps a knock against the side of the boat, that stunned  her; for I have no doubt she could swim, small as she is. This is a much  more serious affair; he has an ugly gash in his temple, his collarbone  is broken, and,\" he went on, as he passed his hands down the patient's  side, \"he has two, if not more ribs broken.\"    \"Well, we will leave him to you, Doctor; there are a lot of these  fellows in the water, and I suppose they must be brought on board until  we can get a boat to take them ashore.\"    In a few minutes eighteen Malays were brought to the side, and the two  canoes, which were floating level with the water, were towed up and  fastened by a rope to the stern of the gunboat. Even when safely on  deck, the two parties were still so infuriated that they had to be  separated and placed under guards apart from each other. Three or four  had been killed by the stabs of the deadly krises, and their bodies  could be seen floating astern. Several of those rescued had wounds more  or less severe.    \"We should not have much chance with those fellows in the water, Mr.  Parkhurst,\" an old sailor said to Harry.    \"No, indeed, Davis; they could swim round and round us, and our  cutlasses would be very little good against those ugly looking krises.  If we were to leave them to themselves, they would fight to the death;  and, after all, it was no one's fault in particular. Mr. Balderson and  I were watching them; one was crossing the ship's bow just as the other  came out from her side, and they were into each other before either had  time to hold their boat up.\"    \"That chap the doctor is bandaging up was in a nice taking about his  child, sir; it was a lucky job that you and Mr. Balderson happened to  catch sight of her.\"    \"Yes, poor little thing! It was only just a glimpse we got of her face;  but as we were looking for her, and ready to dive, it was enough.\"    \"Lucky we are inside the bar, Mr. Parkhurst, or the sharks would have  had half the fellows.\"    \"I did not think of it at the time, Davis, and it would not have made  any difference if I had; we were only in the water a couple of minutes,  and the Malays were making noise enough to frighten away any number of  sharks. You will have the job of washing out our trousers again--we had  only put them on clean half an hour before.\"    \"That aint no matter, sir, especially if you go down and change at once;  the mud will come out easy enough if I leave them in a bucket of fresh  water for half an hour.\"    The two midshipmen joined the group of officers who were standing near  the doctor; the latter had, on closer examination, announced that four  of the ribs were broken. He had finished his work just as the lads came  up. News had been brought up by the steward that the little girl had  opened her eyes; while he was speaking, the Malay conversed rapidly with  the interpreter.    \"What is he saying, Soh Hay?\" the captain asked.    \"He is asking why his daughter is not here, and if she is hurt, and how  she came to be saved,\" the man replied. \"Me tell him she come up to see  him soon; the doctor say she no hurt.\"    Two minutes later the doctor reappeared, carrying the child in his arms.  She looked round fearlessly at the white faces until her eye fell upon  her father, when she slipped out of the doctor's arms like an eel and  ran to him. The grim features of the Malay lit up with a pleasant smile  as he held out his right hand to her. She was a strange little figure,  for the doctor had not waited to obtain any suitable garments for her,  but had wrapped her up in one of the signal flags, which the child  herself had wound round her waist and over her shoulder"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#1)"],[1,"IN TOWN & VILLAGE    BY      W. H. HUDSON,    F.Z.S.    AUTHOR OF \"THE PURPLE LAND,\" \"IDLE DAYS IN PATAGONIA,\" \"FAR AWAY AND  LONG AGO,\" ETC.      1920        PREFACE    This book is more than a mere reprint of _Birds in a Village_ first  published in 1893. That was my first book about bird life, with some  impressions of rural scenes, in England; and, as is often the case with  a first book, its author has continued to cherish a certain affection  for it. On this account it pleased me when its turn came to be reissued,  since this gave me the opportunity of mending some faults in the  portions retained and of throwing out a good deal of matter which  appeared to me not worth keeping.    The first portion, \"Birds in a Village,\" has been mostly rewritten with  some fresh matter added, mainly later observations and incidents  introduced in illustration of the various subjects discussed. For the  concluding portion of the old book, which has been discarded, I have  substituted entirely new matter-the part entitled \"Birds in a Cornish  Village.\"    Between these two long parts there are five shorter essays which I have  retained with little alteration, and these in one or two instances are  consequently out of date, especially in what was said with bitterness in  the essay on \"Exotic Birds for Britain\" anent the feather-wearing  fashion and of the London trade in dead birds and the refusal of women  at that time to help us in trying to save the beautiful wild bird life  of this country and of the world generally from extermination. Happily,  the last twenty years of the life and work of the Royal Society for the  Protection of Birds have changed all that, and it would not now be too  much to say that all right-thinking persons in this country, men and  women, are anxious to see the end of this iniquitous traffic.

STORY OF A JACKDAW              BIRDS IN TOWN & VILLAGE        BIRDS IN A VILLAGE I    About the middle of last May, after a rough and cold period, there came  a spell of brilliant weather, reviving in me the old spring feeling, the  passion for wild nature, the desire for the companionship of birds; and  I betook myself to St. James's Park for the sake of such satisfaction as  may be had from watching and feeding the fowls, wild and semi-wild,  found gathered at that favored spot.    I was glad to observe a couple of those new colonists of the ornamental  water, the dabchicks, and to renew my acquaintance with the familiar,  long-established moorhens. One of them was engaged in building its nest  in an elm-tree growing at the water's edge. I saw it make two journeys  with large wisps of dry grass in its beak, running up the rough,  slanting trunk to a height of sixteen to seventeen feet, and  disappearing within the \"brushwood sheaf\" that springs from the bole at  that distance from the roots. The wood-pigeons were much more numerous,  also more eager to be fed.  They seemed to understand very quickly that  my bread and grain was for them and not the sparrows; but although they  stationed themselves close to me, the little robbers we were jointly  trying to outwit managed to get some pieces of bread by flying up and  catching them before they touched the sward. This little comedy over, I  visited the water-fowl, ducks of many kinds, sheldrakes, geese from many  lands, swans black, and swans white. To see birds in prison during the  spring mood of which I have spoken is not only no satisfaction but a  positive pain; here--albeit without that large liberty that nature  gives, they are free in a measure; and swimming and diving or dozing in  the sunshine, with the blue sky above them, they are perhaps unconscious  of any restraint.  Walking along the margin I noticed three children  some yards ahead of me; two were quite small, but the third, in whose  charge the others were, was a robust-looking girl, aged about ten or  eleven years. From their dress and appearance I took them to be the  children of a respectable artisan or small tradesman; but what chiefly  attracted my attention was the very great pleasure the elder girl  appeared to take in the birds. She had come well provided with stale  bread to feed them, and after giving moderately of her store to the  wood-pigeons and sparrows, she went on to the others, native and exotic,  that were disporting themselves in the water, or sunning themselves on  the green bank. She did not cast her bread on the water in the manner  usual with visitors, but was anxious to feed all the different species,  or as many as she could attract to her, and appeared satisfied when any  one individual of a particular kind got a fragment of her bread.  Meanwhile she talked eagerly to the little ones, calling their attention  to the different birds. Drawing near, I also became an interested  listener; and then, in answer to my questions, she began telling me what  all these strange fowls were. \"This,\" she said, glad to give  information, \"is the Canadian goose, and there is the Egyptian goose;  and here is the king-duck coming towards us; and do you see that large,  beautiful bird standing by itself, that will not come to be fed? That is  the golden duck. But that is not its real name; I don't know them all,  and so I name some for myself. I call that one the golden duck because  in the sun its feathers sometimes shine like gold.\" It was a rare  pleasure to listen to her, and seeing what sort of a girl she was, and  how much in love with her subject, I in my turn told her a great deal  about the birds before us, also of other birds she had never seen nor  heard of, in other and distant lands that have a nobler bird life than  ours; and after she had listened eagerly for some minutes, and had then  been silent a little while, she all at once pressed her two hands  together, and exclaimed rapturously, \"Oh, I do so love the birds!\"    I replied that that was not strange, since it is impossible for us not  to love whatever is lovely, and of all living things birds were made  most beautiful.    Then I walked away, but could not forget the words she had exclaimed,  her whole appearance, the face flushed with color, the eloquent brown  eyes sparkling, the pressed palms, the sudden spontaneous passion of  delight and desire in her tone. The picture was in my mind all that day,  and lived through the next, and so wrought on me that I could not longer  keep away from the birds, which I, too, loved; for now all at once it  seemed to me that life was not life without them; that I was grown sick,  and all my senses dim; that only the wished sight of wild birds could  medicine my vision; that only by drenching it in their wild melody could  my tired brain recover its lost vigour.          II      After wandering somewhat aimlessly about the country for a couple of  days, I stumbled by chance on just such a spot as I had been wishing to  find--a rustic village not too far away. It was not more than  twenty-five minutes' walk from a small station, less than one hour by  rail from London.    The way to the village was through cornfields, bordered by hedges and  rows of majestic elms. Beyond it, but quite near, there was a wood,  principally of beech, over a mile in length, with a public path running  through it. On the right hand, ten minutes' walk from the village, there  was a long green hill, the ascent to which was gentle; but on the  further side it sloped abruptly down to the Thames.    On the left hand there was another hill, with cottages and orchards,  with small fields interspersed on the slope and summit, so that the  middle part, where I lodged, was in a pretty deep hollow. There was no  sound of traffic there, and few farmers' carts came that way, as it was  well away from the roads, and the deep, narrow, winding lanes were  exceedingly rough, like the stony beds of dried-up streams.    In the deepest part of the coombe, in the middle of the village, there  was a well where the cottagers drew their water; and in the summer  evenings the youths and maidens came there, with or without jugs and  buckets, to indulge in conversation, which was mostly of the rustic,  bantering kind, mixed with a good deal of loud laughter. Close by was  the inn, where the men sat on benches in the tap-room in grave discourse  over their pipes and beer.    Wishing to make their acquaintance, I went in and sat down among them,  and found them a little shy--not to say stand-offish, at first. Rustics  are often suspicious of the stranger within their gates; but after  paying for beer all round, the frost melted and we were soon deep in  talk about the wild life of the place; always a safe and pleasant  subject in a village. One rough-looking, brown-faced man, with iron-grey  hair, became a sort of spokesman for the company, and replied to most of  my questions.    \"And what about badgers?\" I asked. \"In such a rough-looking spot with  woods and all, it strikes me as just the sort of place where one would  find that animal.\"    A long dead silence followed. I caught the eye of the man nearest me and  repeated the question, \"Are there no badgers here?\" His eyes fell, then  he exchanged glances with some of the others, all very serious; and at  length my man, addressing the person who had acted as spokesman before,  said, \"Perhaps you'll tell the gentleman if there are any badgers here.\"    At that the rough man looked at me very sharply, and answered stiffly,  \"Not as I know of.\"    A few weeks later, at a small town in the neighbourhood, I got into"]]]
