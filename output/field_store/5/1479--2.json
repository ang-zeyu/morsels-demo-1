[Illustration: EX LIBRIS:  CHARLES FRANKLIN THWING  Western Reserve University  Library    From the Library of  Charles Franklin Thwing  Acquired in 1938]          PREFACE    This volume is the third to be published of a series on \"The World's  Living Religions,\" projected in 1920 by the Board of Missionary  Preparation of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America. The  series seeks to introduce Western readers to the real religious life of  each great national area of the non-Christian world.    Buddhism is a religion which must be viewed from many angles. Its  original form, as preached by Gautama in India and developed in the  early years succeeding, and as embodied in the sacred literature of  early Buddhism, is not representative of the actual Buddhism of any land  today. The faithful student of Buddhist literature would be as far  removed from understanding the working activities of a busy center of  Buddhism in Burmah, Tibet or China today as a student of patristic  literature would be from appreciating the Christian life of London or  New York City.    Moreover Buddhism, like Christianity, has been affected by national  conditions. It has developed at least three markedly different types,  requiring, therefore, as many distinct volumes of this series for its  fair interpretation and presentation. The volume on the Buddhism of  Southern Asia by Professor Kenneth J. Saunders was published in May,  1923; this volume on the Buddhism of China by Professor Hodous will be  the second to appear; a third on the Buddhism of Japan, to be written by  Dr. R. C. Armstrong, will be published in 1924. Each of these is needed  in order that the would be student of Buddhism as practiced in those  countries should be given a true, impressive and friendly picture of  what he will meet.    A missionary no less than a professional student of Buddhism needs to  approach that religion with a real appreciation of what it aims to do  for its people and does do. No one can come into contact with the best  that Buddhism offers without being impressed by its serenity, assurance  and power.    Professor Hodous has written this volume on Buddhism in China out of the  ripe experience and continuing studies of sixteen years of missionary  service in Foochow, the chief city of Fukien Province, China, one of the  important centers of Buddhism. His local studies were supplemented by  the results of broader research and study in northern China. No other  available writer on the subject has gone so far as he in reproducing the  actual thinking of a trained Buddhist mind in regard to the fundamentals  of religion. At the same time he has taken pains to exhibit and to  interpret the religious life of the peasant as affected by Buddhism. He  has sought to be absolutely fair to Buddhism, but still to express his  own conviction that the best that is in Buddhism is given far more  adequate expression in Christianity.    The purpose of each volume in this series is impressionistic rather than  definitely educational. They are not textbooks for the formal study of  Buddhism, but introductions to its study. They aim to kindle interest  and to direct the activity of the awakened student along sound lines.  For further study each volume amply provides through directions and  literature in the appendices. It seeks to help the student to  discriminate, to think in terms of a devotee of Buddhism when he  compares that religion with Christianity. It assumes, however, that  Christianity is the broader and deeper revelation of God and the world  of today.    Buddhism in China undoubtedly includes among its adherents many  high-minded, devout, and earnest souls who live an idealistic life.  Christianity ought to make a strong appeal to such minds, taking from  them none of the joy or assurance or devotion which they possess, but  promoting a deeper, better balanced interpretation of the active world,  a nobler conception of God, a stronger sense of sinfulness and need, and  a truer idea of the full meaning of incarnation and revelation.    It is our hope that this fresh contribution to the understanding of  Buddhism as it is today may be found helpful to readers everywhere.

The beautiful courts of the temple were filled by a throng of  invited guests and spectators, waiting to watch the impressive  procession of candidates, acolytes, attendants and high officials, all  in their appropriate vestments. No outsider was privileged to witness  the solemn taking by each candidate for the priesthood of the vow to  \"keep the Ten Laws,\" followed by the indelible branding of his scalp,  truly a \"baptism of fire.\" Less private was the initiation of the lay  brethren and _sisters,_ more lightly branded on the right wrist,  while all about intoned \"Na Mah Pen Shih Shih Chia Mou Ni Fo.\" (I put my  trust in my original Teacher, Säkyamuni, Buddha.)    The missionary was deeply impressed by the serenity and devotion of the  worshipers and by the dignity and solemnity of the service. The last  candidate to rise and receive the baptism of branding was a young  married woman of refined appearance, attended by an elderly lady,  evidently her mother, who watched with an expression of mingled  devotion, insight and pride her daughter's initiation and welcomed her  at the end of the process with radiant face, as a daughter, now, in a  spiritual as well as a physical sense. At that moment an attendant,  noting the keen interest of the missionary, said to him rather  flippantly, \"Would you not like to have your arm branded, too?\" \"I  might,\" he replied, \"just out of curiosity, but I could not receive the  branding as a believer in the Buddha. I am a Christian believer. To be  branded without inward faith would be an insult to your religion as well  as treachery to my own, would it not? Is not real religion a matter of  the heart?\"    The old lady, who had overheard with evident disapproval the remark of  the attendant, turned to the missionary at once and said, \"Is that the  way you Westerners, you Christians, speak of your faith? Is the reality  of religion for you also an inward experience of the heart?\" And with  that began an interesting interchange of conversation, each party  discovering that in the heart of the other was a genuine longing for God  that overwhelmed all the artificial, material distinctions and the human  devices through which men have limited to particular and exclusive paths  their way of search, and drew these two pilgrims on the way toward God  into a common and very real fellowship of the spirit.

There are in Pegana Mung and Sish and Kib, and the maker of all  small gods, who is MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Moreover, we have a faith in  Roon and Slid.    And it has been said of old that all things that have been were  wrought by the small gods, excepting only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, who  made the gods and hath thereafter rested.    And none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI but only the gods whom he  hath made.    But at the Last will MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI forget to rest, and will  make again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods  whom he hath made.    And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only  MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.        OF SKARL THE DRUMMER      When MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI had made the gods and Skarl, Skarl made a  drum, and began to beat upon it that he might drum for ever. Then  because he was weary after the making of the gods, and because of  the drumming of Skarl, did MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI grow drowsy and fall  asleep.    And there fell a hush upon the gods when they saw that MANA rested,  and there was silence on Pegana save for the drumming of Skarl.  Skarl sitteth upon the mist before the feet of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI,  above the gods of Pegana, and there he beateth his drum. Some say  that the Worlds and the Suns are but the echoes of the drumming of  Skarl, and others say that they be dreams that arise in the mind  of MANA because of the drumming of Skarl, as one may dream whose  rest is troubled by sound of song, but none knoweth, for who hath  heard the voice of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, or who hath seen his drummer?    Whether the season be winter or whether it be summer, whether it  be morning among the worlds or whether it be night, Skarl still  beateth his drum, for the purposes of the gods are not yet fulfilled.  Sometimes the arm of Skarl grows weary; but still he beateth his  drum, that the gods may do the work of the gods, and the worlds go  on, for if he cease for an instant then MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI will start  awake, and there will be worlds nor gods no more.    But, when at the last the arm of Skarl shall cease to beat his drum,  silence shall startle Pegana like thunder in a cave, and MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  shall cease to rest.    Then shall Skarl put his drum upon his back and walk forth into the  void beyond the worlds, because it is THE END, and the work of Skarl  is over.    There may arise some other god whom Skarl may serve, or it may be  that he shall perish; but to Skarl it shall matter not, for he shall  have done the work of Skarl.        OF THE MAKING OF THE WORLDS      When MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI had made the gods there were only the gods,  and They sat in the middle of Time, for there was as much Time  before them as behind them, which having no end had neither a  beginning.    And Pegana was without heat or light or sound, save for the  drumming of Skarl; moreover Pegana was The Middle of All, for  there was below Pegana what there was above it, and there lay  before it that which lay beyond.    Then said the gods, making the signs of the gods and speaking with  Their hands lest the silence of Pegana should blush; then said the  gods to one another, speaking with Their hands; \"Let Us make  worlds to amuse Ourselves while MANA rests. Let Us make worlds and  Life and Death, and colours in the sky; only let Us not break the  silence upon Pegana.\"    Then raising Their hands, each god according to his sign, They  made the worlds and the suns, and put a light in the houses of the  sky.    Then said the gods: \"Let Us make one to seek, to seek and never to  find out concerning the wherefore of the making of the gods.\"    And They made by the lifting of Their hands, each god according to  his sign, the Bright One with the flaring tail to seek from the  end of the Worlds to the end of them again, to return again after  a hundred years.    Man, when thou seest the comet, know that another seeketh besides  thee nor ever findeth out.    Then said the gods, still speaking with Their hands: \"Let there be  now a Watcher to regard.\"    And They made the Moon, with his face wrinkled with many mountains  and worn with a thousand valleys, to regard with pale eyes the  games of the small gods, and to watch throughout the resting time  of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI; to watch, to regard all things, and be  silent.    Then said the gods: \"Let Us make one to rest. One not to move  among the moving. One not to seek like the comet, nor to go round  like the worlds; to rest while MANA rests.\"    And They made the Star of the Abiding and set it in the North.    Man, when thou seest the Star of the Abiding to the North, know  that one resteth as doth MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, and know that somewhere  among the Worlds is rest.    Lastly the gods said: \"We have made worlds and suns, and one to  seek and another to regard, let Us now make one to wonder.\"    And They made Earth to wonder, each god by the uplifting of his  hand according to his sign.    And Earth was.        OF THE GAME OF THE GODS      A million years passed over the first game of the gods. And  MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI still rested, still in the middle of Time, and  the gods still played with Worlds. The Moon regarded, and the  Bright One sought, and returned again to his seeking.    Then Kib grew weary of the first game of the gods, and raised his  hand in Pegana, making the sign of Kib, and Earth became covered  with beasts for Kib to play with.    And Kib played with beasts.    But the other gods said one to another, speaking with their hands:  \"What is it that Kib has done?\"    And They said to Kib: \"What are these things that move upon The  Earth yet move not in circles like the Worlds, that regard like  the Moon and yet they do not shine?\"    And Kib said: \"This is Life.\"    But the gods said one to another: \"If Kib has thus made beasts he  will in time make Men, and will endanger the Secret of the gods.\"    And Mung was jealous of the work of Kib, and sent down Death among  the beasts, but could not stamp them out.    A million years passed over the second game of the gods, and still  it was the Middle of Time.    And Kib grew weary of the second game, and raised his hand in the  Middle of All, making the sign of Kib, and made Men: out of beasts  he made them, and Earth was covered with Men.    Then the gods feared greatly for the Secret of the gods, and set a  veil between Man and his ignorance that he might not understand.  And Mung was busy among Men.    But when the other gods saw Kib playing his new game They came and  played it too. And this They will play until MANA arises to rebuke  Them, saying: \"What do ye playing with Worlds and Suns and Men and  Life and Death?\" And They shall be ashamed of Their playing in the  hour of the laughter of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    It was Kib who first broke the Silence of Pegana, by speaking with  his mouth like a man.    And all the other gods were angry with Kib that he had spoken with  his mouth.    And there was no longer silence in Pegana or the Worlds.        THE CHAUNT OF THE GODS      There came the voice of the gods singing the chaunt of the gods,  singing: \"We are the gods; We are the little games of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI  that he hath played and hath forgotten.    \"MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI hath made us, and We made the Worlds and the  Suns.    \"And We play with the Worlds and the Sun and Life and Death until  MANA arises to rebuke us, saying: 'What do ye playing with Worlds  and Suns?'    \"It is a very serious thing that there be Worlds and Suns, and yet  most withering is the laughter of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.    \"And when he arises from resting at the Last, and laughs at us for  playing with Worlds and Suns, We will hastily put them behind us,  and there shall be Worlds no more.\"        THE SAYINGS OF KIB    (Sender of Life in all the Worlds)      Kib said: \"I am Kib. I am none other than Kib.\"    Kib is Kib. Kib is he and no other. Believe! Kib said: \"When  Time was early, when Time was very early indeed--there was only  MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI was before the beginning of the  gods, and shall be after their going.\"    And Kib said: \"After the going of the gods there will be no small  worlds nor big.\"    Kib said: \"It will be lonely for MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.\"    Because this is written, believe! For is it not written, or are  you greater than Kib? Kib is Kib.        CONCERNING SISH    (The Destroyer of Hours)      Time is the hound of Sish.    At Sish's bidding do the hours run before him as he goeth upon  his way."]]]
