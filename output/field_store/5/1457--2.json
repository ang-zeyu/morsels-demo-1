(#1)"],[1,"LIFE OF KIT CARSON,    Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A.    By Edward S. Ellis.          INTRODUCTION      Christopher Carson, or as he was familiarly called, Kit Carson, was  a man whose real worth was understood only by those with whom he was  associated or who closely studied his character. He was more than  hunter, trapper, guide, Indian agent and Colonel in the United States  Army. He possessed in a marked degree those mental and moral qualities  which would have made him prominent in whatever pursuit or profession he  engaged.    His lot was cast on the extreme western frontier, where, when but a  youth, he earned the respect of the tough and frequently lawless men  with whom he came in contact. Integrity, bravery, loyalty to friends,  marvelous quickness in making right decisions, in crisis of danger,  consummate knowledge of woodcraft, a leadership as skilful as it was  daring; all these were distinguishing traits in the composition of  Carson and were the foundations of the broader fame which he acquired as  the friend and invaluable counselor of Fremont, the Pathfinder, in his  expeditions across the Rocky Mountains.    Father Kit, as he came to be known among the Indians, risked his life  scores of times for those who needed, but had no special claim upon his  services. The red men were quick to learn that he always spoke with a  \"single tongue,\" and that he was their unselfish friend. He went among  his hostiles when no one of his race dare follow him; he averted  more than one outbreak; he secured that which is impossible to  secure--justice for the Indian--and his work from the time when a mere  boy he left his native Kentucky, was always well done. His memory will  forever remain fragrant with those who appreciate true manhood and an  unswerving devotion to the good of those among whom he lived and died.        CHAPTER I.       Kit Carson's Youth--His Visit to New Mexico--Acts as Interpreter and in   Various Other Employments--Joins a Party of Trappers and Engages in a   Fight with Indians--Visits the Sacramento Valley.    \"Kit Carson,\" the most famous hunter, scout and guide ever known in this  country, was a native of Kentucky, the scene of the principal exploits  of Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, the Wetzel brothers and other heroic  pioneers whose names are identified with the history of the settlement  of the West.    Christopher Carson was born in Madison county, December 24, 1809, and,  while he was still an infant, his father removed to Central Missouri,  which at that day was known as Upper Louisiana. It was an immense  wilderness, sparsely settled and abounding with wild animals and  treacherous Indians. The father of Carson, like most of the early  pioneers, divided his time between cultivating the land and hunting  the game in the forests. His house was made strong and was pierced with  loopholes, so as to serve him in his defence against the red men that  were likely to attack him and his family at any hour of the day or  night. In such a school was trained the wonderful scout, hunter and  guide.    No advantages in the way of a common school education were within reach  of the youth situated as was Kit Carson. It is to be believed, however,  that under the tutelage of his father and mother, he picked up a fair  knowledge of the rudimentary branches, for his attainments in that  respect were above the majority of those with whom he was associated in  after life.    While a mere stripling, Kit became known as one of the most skilful  rifle shots in that section of Missouri which produced some of the  finest marksmen in the world. It was inevitable that he should form a  passion for the woods, in which, like the great Boone, he would have  been happy to wander for days and weeks at a time.    When fifteen years old, he was apprenticed to a saddler, where he stayed  two years. At the end of that time, however, the confinement had become  so irksome that he could stand it no longer. He left the shop and joined  a company of traders, preparing to start for Santa Fe, the capital of  New Mexico, one of the most interesting towns in the southwest. The  majority of its population are of Spanish and Mexican origin and speak  Spanish. It is the centre of supplies for the surrounding country, and  is often a scene of great activity. It stands on a plateau, more than  a mile above the sea level, with another snow capped mountain rising a  mile higher. The climate is delightful and the supply of water from the  springs and mountains is of the finest quality.    Santa Fe, when first visited by the Spaniards in 1542, was a populous  Indian pueblo. It has been the capital of New Mexico for nearly two  hundred and fifty years. The houses of the ancient town are made of  adobe, one story high, and the streets are unpaved, narrow, crooked and  ill looking. The inhabitants are of a low order, scarcely entitled to  be ranked above the half civilized, though of late years the infusion of  western life and rugged civilization has given an impetus and character  to the place for which, through three centuries, it waited in vain.    The company to which young Kit Carson attached himself, was strongly  armed and it made the perilous journey, across rivers, mountains and  prairies, through a country infested with fierce Indians, without the  loss of one of their number. This immunity was due to their vigilance  and knowledge of the ways of the hostiles who, it may be said, were on  all sides, from the beginning to the end of their journey.    After reaching Santa Fe, Carson left the party and went to Taos, a small  station to the north of Santa Fe. There he stayed through the winter of  1826-27, at the home of a veteran pioneer, from whom he gained not only  a valuable knowledge of the country and its people, but became familiar  with the Spanish language--an attainment which proved invaluable to  him in after years. In the spring, he joined a party which set out  for Missouri, but before reaching its destination, another company of  traders were met on their way to Santa Fe. Young Carson joined them, and  some days later was back again in the quaint old capital of New Mexico.    The youth's engagement ended with his arrival in the town, but there  was nothing indolent in the nature of Carson, who immediately engaged  himself as teamster to a company about to start to El Paso, on the Rio  Grande, near the frontier of New Mexico. He did not stay long before  drifting back to Santa Fe, and finally to Taos, where he hired out as  a cook during the following winter, but had not wrought long, when  a wealthy trader, learning how well Carson understood the Spanish  language, engaged him as interpreter.    This duty compelled the youth to make another long journey to El Paso  and Chihuahua, the latter being the capital of the province of the same  name, and another of those ancient towns whose history forms one of the  most interesting features of the country. It was founded in 1691 and a  quarter of a century later, when the adjoining silver mines were in full  operation, had a population of 70,000, though today it has scarcely a  fifth of that number.    The position of interpreter was more dignified than any yet held by  Carson, and it was at his command, as long as he chose to hold it; but  to one of his restless nature it soon grew monotonous and he threw it  up, making his way once more to Taos. The employment most congenial to  Carson's nature, and the one which he had been seeking ever since he  left home, was that of hunter and trapper. The scarred veterans whom he  met in the frontier and frontier posts gave him many accounts of their  trapping experiences among the mountains and in the gloomy fastnesses  where, while they hunted the bear, deer, beaver and other animals, the  wild Indian hunted them.    Carson had been in Taos a short time only when he gained the opportunity  for which he was searching. A party of trappers in the employ of Kit's  old friend had just come to Taos, having been driven from their trapping  grounds by the Indians. The employer set about raising a party strong  enough to return to the trapping grounds, chastise the hostiles and  resume business. Knowing the skill and bravery of the young Kentuckian,  the gentleman made him an offer to join the party and Kit eagerly  accepted it.    The Mexicans have never been particularly friendly toward their  neighbors north of the Rio Grande, and at that time a very strict law  was in force which forbade the issuance of any license to American  citizens to trap within Mexican territory. The company which mounted  their horses and rode out of Taos gave the authorities to understand  that their errand was simply to chastise the red men, whereas their  real purpose was to engage in trapping. With a view of misleading the  officers, they took a roundabout route which delayed their arrival in  the section. Nevertheless, the hunters were desirous of punishing the  Indians who had taken such liberties with the small party that preceded  them. On one of the tributaries of the Gila, the trappers came upon the  identical band whom they attacked with such fierceness that more than a  dozen were killed and the rest put to flight. The fight was a desperate  one, but young as Carson was, he acquitted himself in a manner which  won the warmest praise of those with him. He was unquestionably daring,  skilful and sagacious, and was certain, if his life was spared, to  become one of the most valuable members of the party.    Having driven the savages away, the Americans began or rather resumed  their regular business of trapping. The beavers were so abundant that  they met with great success. When the rodents seemed to diminish in  number, the hunters shifted their quarters, pursuing their profession  along the numerous streams until it was decided to divide into two  parties, one of which returned to New Mexico, while the other pushed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7885"],[0,"Celtic Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreaders                    CELTIC FAIRY TALES        _SELECTED AND EDITED BY_    JOSEPH JACOBS        _SAY THIS    Three times, with your eyes shut_    Mothuighim boladh an Eireannaigh bhinn bhreugaigh faoi m'fhoidin  duthaigh.    _And you will see    What you will see_        _TO ALFRED NUTT_        PREFACE    Last year, in giving the young ones a volume of English Fairy Tales, my  difficulty was one of collection. This time, in offering them specimens  of the rich folk-fancy of the Celts of these islands, my trouble has  rather been one of selection. Ireland began to collect her folk-tales  almost as early as any country in Europe, and Croker has found a whole  school of successors in Carleton, Griffin, Kennedy, Curtin, and Douglas  Hyde. Scotland had the great name of Campbell, and has still efficient  followers in MacDougall, MacInnes, Carmichael, Macleod, and Campbell of  Tiree. Gallant little Wales has no name to rank alongside these; in  this department the Cymru have shown less vigour than the Gaedhel.  Perhaps the Eisteddfod, by offering prizes for the collection of Welsh  folk-tales, may remove this inferiority. Meanwhile Wales must be  content to be somewhat scantily represented among the Fairy Tales of  the Celts, while the extinct Cornish tongue has only contributed one  tale.    In making my selection I have chiefly tried to make the stories  characteristic. It would have been easy, especially from Kennedy, to  have made up a volume entirely filled with \"Grimm's Goblins\" _a la  Celtique_. But one can have too much even of that very good thing, and  I have therefore avoided as far as possible the more familiar  \"formulae\" of folk-tale literature. To do this I had to withdraw from  the English-speaking Pale both in Scotland and Ireland, and I laid down  the rule to include only tales that have been taken down from Celtic  peasants ignorant of English.    Having laid down the rule, I immediately proceeded to break it. The  success of a fairy book, I am convinced, depends on the due admixture  of the comic and the romantic: Grimm and Asbjoernsen knew this secret,  and they alone. But the Celtic peasant who speaks Gaelic takes the  pleasure of telling tales somewhat sadly: so far as he has been printed  and translated, I found him, to my surprise, conspicuously lacking in  humour. For the comic relief of this volume I have therefore had to  turn mainly to the Irish peasant of the Pale; and what richer source  could I draw from?    For the more romantic tales I have depended on the Gaelic, and, as I  know about as much of Gaelic as an Irish Nationalist M. P., I have had  to depend on translators. But I have felt myself more at liberty than  the translators themselves, who have generally been over-literal, in  changing, excising, or modifying the original. I have even gone  further. In order that the tales should be characteristically Celtic, I  have paid more particular attention to tales that are to be found on  both sides of the North Channel.    In re-telling them I have had no scruple in interpolating now and then  a Scotch incident into an Irish variant of the same story, or _vice  versa_. Where the translators appealed to English folklorists and  scholars, I am trying to attract English children. They translated; I  endeavoured to transfer. In short, I have tried to put myself into the  position of an _ollamh_ or _sheenachie_ familiar with both forms of  Gaelic, and anxious to put his stories in the best way to attract  English children. I trust I shall be forgiven by Celtic scholars for  the changes I have had to make to effect this end.    The stories collected in this volume are longer and more detailed than  the English ones I brought together last Christmas. The romantic ones  are certainly more romantic, and the comic ones perhaps more comic,  though there may be room for a difference of opinion on this latter  point. This superiority of the Celtic folk-tales is due as much to the  conditions under which they have been collected, as to any innate  superiority of the folk-imagination. The folk-tale in England is in the  last stages of exhaustion. The Celtic folk-tales have been collected  while the practice of story-telling is still in full vigour, though  there are every signs that its term of life is already numbered. The  more the reason why they should be collected and put on record while  there is yet time. On the whole, the industry of the collectors of  Celtic folk-lore is to be commended, as may be seen from the survey of  it I have prefixed to the Notes and References at the end of the  volume. Among these, I would call attention to the study of the legend  of Beth Gellert, the origin of which, I believe, I have settled.    While I have endeavoured to render the language of the tales simple and  free from bookish artifice, I have not felt at liberty to retell the  tales in the English way. I have not scrupled to retain a Celtic turn  of speech, and here and there a Celtic word, which I have _not_  explained within brackets--a practice to be abhorred of all good men. A  few words unknown to the reader only add effectiveness and local colour  to a narrative, as Mr. Kipling well knows.    One characteristic of the Celtic folk-lore I have endeavoured to  represent in my selection, because it is nearly unique at the present  day in Europe. Nowhere else is there so large and consistent a body of  oral tradition about the national and mythical heroes as amongst the  Gaels. Only the _byline_, or hero-songs of Russia, equal in extent the  amount of knowledge about the heroes of the past that still exists  among the Gaelic-speaking peasantry of Scotland and Ireland. And the  Irish tales and ballads have this peculiarity, that some of them have  been extant, and can be traced, for well nigh a thousand years. I have  selected as a specimen of this class the Story of Deirdre, collected  among the Scotch peasantry a few years ago, into which I have been able  to insert a passage taken from an Irish vellum of the twelfth century.  I could have more than filled this volume with similar oral traditions  about Finn (the Fingal of Macpherson's \"Ossian\"). But the story of  Finn, as told by the Gaelic peasantry of to-day, deserves a volume by  itself, while the adventures of the Ultonian hero, Cuchulain, could  easily fill another.    I have endeavoured to include in this volume the best and most typical  stories told by the chief masters of the Celtic folk-tale, Campbell,  Kennedy, Hyde, and Curtin, and to these I have added the best tales  scattered elsewhere. By this means I hope I have put together a volume,  containing both the best, and the best known folk-tales of the Celts. I  have only been enabled to do this by the courtesy of those who owned  the copyright of these stories. Lady Wilde has kindly granted me the  use of her effective version of \"The Horned Women;\" and I have  specially to thank Messrs. Macmillan for right to use Kennedy's  \"Legendary Fictions,\" and Messrs. Sampson Low & Co., for the use of Mr.  Curtin's Tales.    In making my selection, and in all doubtful points of treatment, I have  had resource to the wide knowledge of my friend Mr. Alfred Nutt in all  branches of Celtic folk-lore. If this volume does anything to represent  to English children the vision and colour, the magic and charm, of the  Celtic folk-imagination, this is due in large measure to the care with  which Mr. Nutt has watched its inception and progress. With him by my  side I could venture into regions where the non-Celt wanders at his own  risk.    Lastly, I have again to rejoice in the co-operation of my friend, Mr.  J. D. Batten, in giving form to the creations of the folk-fancy. He has  endeavoured in his illustrations to retain as much as possible of  Celtic ornamentation; for all details of Celtic archaeology he has  authority. Yet both he and I have striven to give Celtic things as they  appear to, and attract, the English mind, rather than attempt the  hopeless task of representing them as they are to Celts. The fate of  the Celt in the British Empire bids fair to resemble that of the Greeks  among the Romans. \"They went forth to battle, but they always fell,\"  yet the captive Celt has enslaved his captor in the realm of  imagination. The present volume attempts to begin the pleasant  captivity from the earliest years. If it could succeed in giving a  common fund of imaginative wealth to the Celtic and the Saxon children  of these isles, it might do more for a true union of hearts than all  your politics.
