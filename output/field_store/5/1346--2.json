Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries; whom  mankind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of science,  the pionier of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and clear  obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press  forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on the  humble drudge that facilitates their progress. Every other authour  may aspire to praise; the lexicographer can only hope to escape  reproach, and even this negative recompense has been yet granted  to very few.    I have, notwithstanding this discouragement, attempted a dictionary  of the English language, which, while it was employed in the  cultivation of every species of literature, has itself been hitherto  neglected; suffered to spread, under the direction of chance, into  wild exuberance; resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion; and  exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation.    When I took the first survey of my undertaking, I found our speech  copious without order, and energetick without rules: wherever  I turned my view, there was perplexity to be disentangled, and  confusion to be regulated; choice was to be made out of boundless  variety, without any established principle of selection; adulterations  were to be detected, without a settled test of purity; and modes  of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages of  any writers of classical reputation or acknowledged authority.    Having therefore no assistance but from general grammar, I applied  myself to the perusal of our writers; and noting whatever might be  of use to ascertain or illustrate any word or phrase, accumulated  in time the materials of a dictionary, which, by degrees, I reduced  to method, establishing to myself, in the progress of the work,  such rules as experience and analogy suggested to me; experience,  which practice and observation were continually increasing; and  analogy, which, though in some words obscure, was evident in others.    In adjusting the ORTHOGRAPHY, which has been to this time unsettled  and fortuitous, I found it necessary to distinguish those irregularities  that are inherent in our tongue, and perhaps coeval with it, from  others which the ignorance or negligence of later writers has  produced. Every language has its anomalies, which, though inconvenient,  and in themselves once unnecessary, must be tolerated among the  imperfections of human things, and which require only to be registered,  that they may not be increased, and ascertained, that they may not  be confounded: but every language has likewise its improprieties and  absurdities, which it is the duty of the lexicographer to correct  or proscribe.    As language was at its beginning merely oral, all words of necessary  or common use were spoken before they were written; and while they  were unfixed by any visible signs, must have been spoken with great  diversity, as we now observe those who cannot read catch sounds  imperfectly, and utter them negligently. When this wild and barbarous  jargon was first reduced to an alphabet, every penman endeavoured  to express, as he could, the sounds which he was accustomed to  pronounce or to receive, and vitiated in writing such words as were  already vitiated in speech. The powers of the letters, when they  were applied to a new language, must have been vague and unsettled,  and therefore different hands would exhibit the same sound by  different combinations.    From this uncertain pronunciation arise in a great part the various  dialects of the same country, which will always be observed to  grow fewer, and less different, as books are multiplied; and from  this arbitrary representation of sounds by letters, proceeds that  diversity of spelling observable in the Saxon remains, and I suppose  in the first books of every nation, which perplexes or destroys  analogy, and produces anomalous formations, that, being once  incorporated, can never be afterward dismissed or reformed.    Of this kind are the derivatives length from long, strength from  strong, darling from dear, breadth from broad, from dry, drought,  and from high, height, which Milton, in zeal for analogy, writes  highth; Quid te exempta juvat spinis de pluribus una [Horace,  Epistles, II. ii. 212]; to change all would be too much, and to  change one is nothing.    This uncertainty is most frequent in the vowels, which are so  capriciously pronounced, and so differently modified, by accident  or affectation, not only in every province, but in every mouth,  that to them, as is well known to etymologists, little regard is  to be shewn in the deduction of one language from another.    Such defects are not errours in orthography, but spots of barbarity  impressed so deep in the English language, that criticism can  never wash them away: these, therefore, must be permitted to remain  untouched; but many words have likewise been altered by accident,  or depraved by ignorance, as the pronunciation of the vulgar has been  weakly followed; and some still continue to be variously written,  as authours differ in their care or skill: of these it was proper  to enquire the true orthography, which I have always considered  as depending on their derivation, and have therefore referred them  to their original languages: thus I write enchant, enchantment,  enchanter, after the French and incantation after the Latin; thus  entire is chosen rather than intire, because it passed to us not  from the Latin integer, but from the French entier.    Of many words it is difficult to say whether they were immediately  received from the Latin or the French, since at the time when we  had dominions in France, we had Latin service in our churches. It  is, however, my opinion, that the French generally supplied us; for  we have few Latin words, among the terms of domestick use, which  are not French; but many French, which are very remote from Latin.    Even in words of which the derivation is apparent, I have been  often obliged to sacrifice uniformity to custom; thus I write, in  compliance with a numberless majority, convey and inveigh, deceit  and receipt, fancy and phantom; sometimes the derivative varies  from the primitive, as explain and explanation, repeat and repetition.    Some combinations of letters having the same power are used  indifferently without any discoverable reason of choice, as in  choak, choke; soap, sope; jewel, fuel, and many others; which I  have sometimes inserted twice, that those who search for them under  either form, may not search in vain.    In examining the orthography of any doubtful word, the mode of  spelling by which it is inserted in the series of the dictionary,  is to be considered as that to which I give, perhaps not often  rashly, the preference. I have left, in the examples, to every  authour his own practice unmolested, that the reader may balance  suffrages, and judge between us: but this question is not always  to be determined by reputed or by real learning; some men, intent  upon greater things, have thought little on sounds and derivations;  some, knowing in the ancient tongues, have neglected those in which  our words are commonly to be sought. Thus Hammond writes fecibleness  for feasibleness, because I suppose he imagined it derived immediately  from the Latin; and some words, such as dependant, dependent,  dependance, dependence, vary their final syllable, as one or another  language is present to the writer.    In this part of the work, where caprice has long wantoned without  controul, and vanity sought praise by petty reformation, I have  endeavoured to proceed with a scholar's reverence for antiquity,  and a grammarian's regard to the genius of our tongue. I have  attempted few alterations, and among those few, perhaps the greater  part is from the modern to the ancient practice; and I hope I may  be allowed to recommend to those, whose thoughts have been perhaps  employed too anxiously on verbal singularities, not to disturb,  upon narrow views, or for minute propriety, the orthography of  their fathers. It has been asserted, that for the law to be KNOWN,  is of more importance than to be RIGHT. Change, says Hooker, is  not made without inconvenience, even from worse to better. There is  in constancy and stability a general and lasting advantage, which  will always overbalance the slow improvements of gradual correction.  Much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions  of oral utterance, or copy that which every variation of time or  place makes different from itself, and imitate those changes, which  will again be changed, while imitation is employed in observing  them.    This recommendation of steadiness and uniformity does not proceed  from an opinion, that particular combinations of letters have much  influence on human happiness; or that truth may not be successfully  taught by modes of spelling fanciful And erroneous: I am not yet so  lost in lexicography, as to I forget that WORDS ARE THE DAUGHTERS  OF EARTH, AND THAT THINGS ARE THE SONS OF HEAVEN.  Language is only  the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas: I  wish, however, that the instrument might be less apt to decay, and  that signs might be permanent, like the things which they denote.    In settling the orthography, I have not wholly neglected the  pronunciation, which I have directed, by printing an accent upon  the acute or elevated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#1)"],[1,"(http://mormontextsproject.org), with thanks to Heidi Billy                  [Image: James Brown]      LIFE OF A  PIONEER      BEING THE  AUTOBIOGRAPHY  OF  JAMES S. BROWN.      SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH:    GEO. Q. CANNON & SONS CO., Printers.  1900.        PREFACE.    THE life of a pioneer in Western America always is full of peril  and hardship; often it has a large share of startling episodes and  thrilling adventures; not infrequently it is associated with notable  historic events; and the experiences met with develop independence of  character, firmness of purpose, and, in those whose spiritual nature  is not dwarfed by unworthy conduct, a sublime faith in God that when  man puts forth his highest endeavor all things beyond the scope of his  efforts are ordered for the best by the Great Ruler of the universe.  When to the pioneer's experiences are added those that come from travel  in foreign lands, perils of the sea, and the hostility of warlike foes,  the narrative of such a life cannot fail to be alike profitable and  interesting reading to both young and old.    The subject of the autobiographical sketch in this volume feels that  he is not presumptuous in saying that each class of experience named  in relation to the pioneer and the traveler has been his. The perils  and hardships of the pioneers in whose work he commingled have been  the theme of song and story for half a century; the thrilling and  adventurous character of his experiences as frontiers-man and Indian  interpreter were of a kind notable even in those avocations; his  association with historic events of moment includes the period when  the territorial area of the great Republic was almost doubled by the  acquisition of the Pacific slope and the Rocky Mountain region, and  when the great gold discovery in California was made, since he was  a member of the famous Mormon Battalion and also was present at the  finding of gold in California, being the first man to declare--on  tests made by himself--that the little yellow flakes were the precious  metal; and his reliance on Deity is portrayed in his missionary work  at home and in foreign lands, with civilized people and among savages,  often in circumstances when life itself apparently was forfeit to duty  conscientiously performed.    In the following pages there is no claim to transcendent literary  merit. Yet the writer feels that the narrative is presented in the  plain and simple language of the people, with a clearness and force  of expression that will be pleasing and impressive to every reader  possessed of ordinary or of superior educational attainments; while  the very simplicity and directness of the language used, far from  embellishing the events described, prove an invaluable guide in  securing accuracy, that not an incident shall be overdrawn or given  undue importance.    The purpose of the writer has been to relate the story of his life, for  the benefit and entertainment of his children and friends, and of all  others who may read it, and to do so with a strict regard for veracity;  for he feels that the numerous thrilling and sensational incidents in  his life were sufficiently exciting to bear a toning down that comes  from calm contemplation when the agitation of the immediate occurrence  has passed, rather than to need the coloring of a graphic pen. In such  a presentation, too, he feels that the result of his labors in this  respect will be a further step in carrying out that which has been the  leading purpose of his life, namely, to do good to all mankind, to the  glory of God.    With a fervent desire and firm confidence that every worthy aim in  presenting this autobiography shall be achieved, and shall find a  vigorous and ennobling response in the hearts of those who read it, the  leading events of his life, and the narration thereof, are respectfully  submitted to his family and friends by    THE AUTHOR.
