MY DEAR LADS,    The order of the Knights of St. John, which for some centuries played  a very important part in the great struggle between Christianity and  Mahomedanism, was, at its origin, a semi-religious body, its members  being, like other monks, bound by vows of obedience, chastity, and  poverty, and pledged to minister to the wants of the pilgrims who  flocked to the Holy Places, to receive them at their great Hospital--or  guest house--at Jerusalem, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and to  defend them on their passage to and from the sea, against attack by  Moslems. In a comparatively short time the constitution of the order was  changed, and the Knights Hospitallers became, like the Templars, a  great military Order pledged to defend the Holy Sepulchre, and to war  everywhere against the Moslems. The Hospitallers bore a leading share  in the struggle which terminated in the triumph of the Moslems, and the  capture by them of Jerusalem. The Knights of St. John then established  themselves at Acre, but after a valiant defence of that fortress,  removed to Crete, and shortly afterwards to Rhodes. There they fortified  the town, and withstood two terrible sieges by the Turks. At the end  of the second they obtained honourable terms from Sultan Solyman, and  retiring to Malta established themselves there in an even stronger  fortress than that of Rhodes, and repulsed all the efforts of the Turks  to dispossess them. The Order was the great bulwark of Christendom  against the invasion of the Turks, and the tale of their long struggle  is one of absorbing interest, and of the many eventful episodes none  is more full of incident and excitement than the first siege of Rhodes,  which I have chosen for the subject of my story.    Yours truly, G. A. Henty          CHAPTER I The King Maker      A stately lady was looking out of the window of an apartment in the  Royal Chateau of Amboise, in the month of June, 1470. She was still  handsome, though many years of anxiety, misfortune, and trouble, had  left their traces on her face. In the room behind her, a knight was  talking to a lady sitting at a tambour frame; a lad of seventeen was  standing at another window stroking a hawk that sat on his wrist,  while a boy of nine was seated at a table examining the pages of an  illuminated missal.    \"What will come of it, Eleanor?\" the lady at the window said, turning  suddenly and impatiently from it. \"It seems past belief that I am to  meet as a friend this haughty earl, who has for fifteen years been the  bitterest enemy of my House. It appears almost impossible.\"    \"'Tis strange indeed, my Queen; but so many strange things have befallen  your Majesty that you should be the last to wonder at this. At any rate,  as you said but yesterday, naught but good can come of it. He has done  his worst against you, and one can scarce doubt that if he chooses he  has power to do as much good for you, as in past times he has done you  evil. 'Tis certain that his coming here shows he is in earnest, for  his presence,--which is sure sooner or later to come to the ears of the  Usurper,--will cause him to fall into the deepest disgrace.\"    \"And yet it seemed,\" the queen said, \"that by marrying his daughter  to Clarence he had bound himself more firmly than ever to the side of  York.\"    \"Ay, madam,\" the knight said. \"But Clarence himself is said to be alike  unprincipled and ambitious, and it may well be that Warwick intended to  set him up against Edward; had he not done so, such an alliance would  not necessarily strengthen his position at Court.\"    \"Methinks your supposition is the true one, Sir Thomas,\" the queen said.  \"Edward cares not sufficiently for his brother to bestow much favour  upon the father of the prince's wife. Thus, he would gain but little  by the marriage unless he were to place Clarence on the throne. Then  he would again become the real ruler of England, as he was until Edward  married Elizabeth Woodville, and the House of Rivers rose to the first  place in the royal favour, and eclipsed the Star of Warwick. It is no  wonder the proud Earl chafes under the ingratitude of the man who owes  his throne to him, and that he is ready to dare everything so that he  can but prove to him that he is not to be slighted with impunity. But  why come to me, when he has Clarence as his puppet?\"    \"He may have convinced himself, madam, that Clarence is even less to  be trusted than Edward, or he may perceive that but few of the Yorkists  would follow him were he to declare against the Usurper, while assuredly  your adherents would stand aloof altogether from such a struggle.  Powerful as he is, Warwick could not alone withstand the united forces  of all the nobles pledged to the support of the House of York. Thence,  as I take it, does it happen that he has resolved to throw in his lot  with Lancaster, if your Majesty will but forgive the evil he has done  your House and accept him as your ally. No doubt he will have terms to  make and conditions to lay down.\"    \"He may make what conditions he chooses,\" Queen Margaret said  passionately, \"so that he does but aid me to take vengeance on that  false traitor; to place my husband again on the throne; and to obtain  for my son his rightful heritage.\"    As she spoke a trumpet sounded in the courtyard below.    \"He has come,\" she exclaimed. \"Once again, after years of misery and  humiliation, I can hope.\"    \"We had best retire, madam,\" Sir Thomas Tresham said. \"He will speak  more freely to your Majesty if there are no witnesses. Come, Gervaise,  it is time that you practised your exercises.\" And Sir Thomas, with his  wife and child, quitted the room, leaving Queen Margaret with her son to  meet the man who had been the bitterest foe of her House, the author of  her direst misfortunes.    For two hours the Earl of Warwick was closeted with the queen; then he  took horse and rode away. As soon as he did so, a servant informed Sir  Thomas and his wife that the queen desired their presence. Margaret was  standing radiant when they entered.    \"Congratulate me, my friends,\" she said. \"The Star of Lancaster has  risen again. Warwick has placed all his power and influence at our  disposal. We have both forgiven all the past: I the countless injuries  he has inflicted on my House, he the execution of his father and so many  of his friends. We have both laid aside all our grievances, and we stand  united by our hate for Edward. There is but one condition, and this I  accepted gladly--namely, that my son should marry his daughter Anne.  This will be another bond between us; and by all reports Anne is a  charming young lady. Edward has gladly agreed to the match; he could  make no alliance, even with the proudest princess in Europe, which would  so aid him, and so strengthen his throne.\"    \"God grant that your hopes may be fulfilled, madam,\" the knight said  earnestly, \"and that peace may be given to our distracted country! The  Usurper has rendered himself unpopular by his extravagance and by the  exactions of his tax collectors, and I believe that England will gladly  welcome the return of its lawful king to power. When does Warwick  propose to begin?\"    \"He will at once get a fleet together. Louis, who has privately brought  about this meeting, will of course throw no impediment in his way; but,  on the other hand, the Duke of Burgundy will do all in his power to  thwart the enterprise, and will, as soon as he learns of it, warn  Edward. I feel new life in me, Eleanor. After fretting powerless for  years, I seem to be a different woman now that there is a prospect of  action. I am rejoiced at the thought that at last I shall be able to  reward those who have ventured and suffered so much in the cause of  Lancaster.\"    \"My hope is, madam, that this enterprise will be the final one,--that,  once successful, our dear land will be no longer deluged with blood,  and that never again shall I be forced to draw my sword against my  countrymen.\"    \"'Tis a good and pious wish, Sir Thomas, and heartily do I join in it.  My married life has been one long round of trouble, and none more than I  have cause to wish for peace.\"    \"There is the more hope for it, madam, that these wars have greatly  diminished the number of powerful barons. It is they who are the authors  of this struggle; their rivalries and their ambitions are the ruin of  England. Save for their retainers there would be no armies to place in  the field; the mass of people stand aloof altogether, desiring only to  live in peace and quiet. 'Tis the same here in France; 'tis the powerful  vassals of the king that are ever causing trouble.\"    \"'Tis so indeed, Sir Thomas. But without his feudal lords how could a  king place an army in the field, when his dominions were threatened by a  powerful neighbour?\"    \"Then it would be the people's business to fight, madam, and I doubt not  that they would do so in defence of their hearths and homes. Besides,  the neighbour would no longer have the power of invasion were he also  without great vassals. These great barons stand between the king and  his subjects; and a monarch would be a king indeed were he able to rule  without their constant dictation, and undisturbed by their rivalry and  ambitions.\"    \"That would be a good time indeed, Sir Thomas,\" the queen said, with a  smile; \"but methinks there is but little chance of its coming about, for  at present it seems to me that the vassals are better able to make or  unmake kings, than kings are able to deprive the great vassals of  power; and never since Norman William set foot in England were they more  powerful than they are at present. What does my chance of recovering our  throne rest upon? Not upon our right, but on the quarrel between Warwick  and the House of Rivers. We are but puppets that the great lords play  against each other. Did it depend upon my will,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team                                     Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School                                        OR                              The Parting of the Ways                           BY JESSIE GRAHAM FLOWER, A.

What shall we do without you?\"  exclaimed Grace Harlowe mournfully.    It was a sunny afternoon in early October, and Grace Harlowe with her  three chums, Anne Pierson, Nora O'Malley and Jessica Bright, stood  grouped around three young men on the station platform at Oakdale. For  Hippy Wingate, Reddy Brooks and David Nesbit were leaving that afternoon  to begin a four years' course in an eastern college, and a number of  relatives and friends had gathered to wish them godspeed.    Those who have read \"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School\"  need no introduction to these three young men or to the girl chums. The  doings of these merry girls made the record of their freshman year  memorable indeed. The winning of the freshman prize by Anne Pierson,  despite the determined opposition and plotting of Miriam Nesbit, also  aspiring to that honor, Mrs. Gray's Christmas party, the winter picnic  that ended in an adventure with wolves, and many other stirring events  furnished plenty of excitement for the readers of that volume.    In \"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School\" the interest  of the story was centered around the series of basketball games played  by the sophomore and junior classes for the High School championship. In  this volume was narrated the efforts of Miriam Nesbit, aided by Julia  Crosby, the disagreeable junior captain, to discredit Anne, and force  Grace to resign the captaincy of her team. The rescue of Julia by Grace  from drowning during a skating party served to bring about a  reconciliation between the two girls and clear Anne's name of the  suspicion resting upon it. The two classes, formerly at sword's points,  became friendly, and buried the hatchet, although Miriam Nesbit, still  bitterly jealous of Grace's popularity, planned a revenge upon Grace  that nearly resulted in making her miss playing on her team during the  deciding game. Grace's encounter with an escaped lunatic, David Nesbit's  trial flight in his aeroplane, were incidents that also held the  undivided attention of the reader.    In \"Grace Harlowe's Junior Year at High School\" the four chums  appeared as members of the famous sorority, the \"Phi Sigma Tau,\"  organized by Grace for the purpose of helping needy High School girls.    In that volume Eleanor Savelli, the self-willed, temperamental daughter  of an Italian violin virtuoso, furnished much of the interest of the  book. The efforts of Grace and her chums to create in this girl a  healthy, wholesome enjoyment for High School life, and her repudiation  of their friendship, and subsequent attempts to revenge herself for  fancied slights and insults, served to make the story absorbing.    The walking expedition through Upton Wood, the rescue of Mabel Allison,  an orphan, by the Phi Sigma Tau, from the tender mercies of a cruel and  ignorant woman with whom she lived, proved interesting reading.    The class play in which Eleanor plotted to oust Anne Pierson, the star,  from the production and obtain the leading part for herself, the  discovery of the plot at the eleventh hour by Grace, enabling her to  balk Eleanor's scheme, were among the incidents that aroused anew the  admiration of the reader for capable, wide-awake Grace Harlowe.    The seven young people on the platform looked unusually solemn, and a  brief silence followed Grace's wistful question. Saying good-bye  threatened to be a harder task than any of them had imagined it to be.  Even Hippy, usually ready of speech, wore a look of concern decidedly  out of place on his fat, good-humored face.    \"Do say something funny, Hippy!\" exclaimed Nora in desperation. \"This  silence is awful. In another minute we'll all be weeping. Can't you  offer something cheerful?\"    Hippy fixed a reflective eye upon Nora for an instant, then recited in a  husky voice:        \"Remember well, and bear in mind,      That fat young men are hard to find.\"    There was a shout of laughter went up at this and things began to take a  brighter turn.    \"Now will you be good, Nora?\" teased David.    \"Humph!\" sniffed Nora. \"I knew his sadness was only skin deep.\"    \"After all,\" said Anne Pierson, \"why should we look at the gloomy side.  You are all coming home for Thanksgiving and the time will slip by  before we realize it. It's our duty to send you boys away in good  spirits, instead of making you feel blue and melancholy.\"    \"Anne always thinks about her duty,\" laughed Jessica, \"but she's right,  nevertheless. Let's all be as cheerful as possible.\"    \"I hear the train coming,\" cried Grace, always on the alert. \"Do write  to us, won't you, boys! Please don't forget to send us some pictures of  the college.\"    \"Yes, don't let that new Eastman of yours go to waste, Reddy,\" said  Nora.    \"I will make Hippy pose the minute we strike the college campus,\"  laughed Reddy, \"and you shall have the first results, providing they are  not too terrifying.\"    \"I want pictures of the college, not the inmates,\" retorted Nora.    \"Inmates!\" cried Hippy. \"One would think she was speaking of a lunatic  asylum or a jail. I forgive you, Nora, but it was a cruel thrust. Here  comes the train. Get busy, you fellows, and make your fond farewells to  your families, who will no doubt be tickled pink to get rid of you for a  while.\"    With that he made a rush to where his father and brother stood. David  turned to his mother and sister Miriam, kissing them affectionately,  while Reddy grasped his father's hand with silent affection in his eyes.    The last good-byes were reserved for the four chums, who felt lumps rise  in their throats in spite of their recently avowed declaration to be  cheerful.    Nora shoved a white box tied up with blue ribbon into Hippy's hand just  as he was about to board the train.    \"It's walnut fudge,\" she said. \"But it isn't all for you. Be generous,  and let David and Reddy have some, too.\"    \"Good-bye. Good-bye. Don't forget us,\" chorused the chums as the train  pulled out, while the young men waved farewell from the open windows.    \"I hope I won't be called upon to say good-bye to any more of my friends  for a blue moon!\" exclaimed Grace. \"I hate good-byes. When it comes my  turn to go to college I believe I shall slip away quietly without saying  a word to a soul except mother.\"    \"You know you couldn't leave your little playmates in such a heartless  manner,\" said Jessica. \"We'd visit you in nightmares the whole of your  freshman year if you even attempted such a thing.\"    \"Oh, well, if you are going to use threats I expect I shall have to  forego my vanishing act,\" said Grace, with a smile.    The four girls had walked the length of the platform and were about to  turn in at the entrance leading to the street when Grace suddenly  clutched Anne, pointing, and crying out, \"Oh, look! look!\"    Three pairs of eyes were turned instantly in the direction of her  finger, just in time to see a dark blue touring car crash against a tree  at the foot of the hilly street leading down to the station.    Its two occupants, the chauffeur and a woman who sat in the tonneau,  were thrown out with considerable force and lay motionless at one side  of the street.    In a twinkling the four girls had reached the woman's side. Grace knelt  beside her, then sat down on the pavement, raising the stranger's head  until it rested in her lap. The woman lay white and still, although on  placing a hand to her heart Grace found that it was beating faintly.  Calling for water, she dashed it in the woman's face, without any  noticeable results.    By this time a crowd had collected and several men were busy with the  chauffeur, who was conscious, but moaned as though in pain.    \"Do go for a doctor, please,\" Grace cried to her chums. \"I am afraid  this woman is badly hurt.\"    \"Here's Dr. Gale now,\" exclaimed Anne as the old doctor came hurrying  across the street.    \"Hello, what's the matter here?\" he called. \"It's a good thing I  happened to be driving by.\"    \"Oh, Dr. Gale, do look at this poor woman. She must have struck her  head, for she lies as though she were dead.\"    Kneeling beside the stranger, the doctor busied himself with her, and  after a little time the woman"]]]
