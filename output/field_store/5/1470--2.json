CONTRIBUTIONS TO NORTH AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    VOLUME IV          HOUSES AND HOUSE-LIFE OF THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES    BY LEWIS H. MORGAN          PREFACE.    The following work substantially formed the Fifth Part of the  original manuscript of \"Ancient Society,\" under the title \"Growth of  the Idea of House Architecture.\" As the manuscript exceeded the  limits of a single volume, this portion (Part V) was removed, and  having then no intention to publish it separately, the greater part  of it found its way into print in detached articles. A summary was  given to Johnson's New Universal Cyclopedia in the article on the  \"Architecture of the American Aborigines.\" The chapter on the  \"Houses of the Aztecs\" formed the basis of the article entitled  \"Montezuma's Dinner,\" published in the North American Review, in  April, 1876. Another chapter, that on the \"Houses of the Mound  Builders,\" was published in the same Review in July, 1876. Finally,  the present year, at the request of the executive committee of the  \"Archaeological Institute of America,\" at Cambridge, I prepared from  the same materials an article entitled \"A Study of the Houses and  House Life of the Indian Tribes,\" with a scheme for the exploration  of the ruins in New Mexico, Arizona, the San Juan region, Yucatan,  and Central America.    With some additions and reductions the facts are now presented in  their original form, and as they will now have a wider distribution  than the articles named have had, they will be new to most of my  readers. The facts and suggestions made will also have the advantage  of being presented in their proper connection. Thus additional  strength is given to the argument as a whole. All the forms of this  architecture sprang from a common mind, and exhibit, as a consequence,  different stages of development of the same conceptions, operating  upon similar necessities. They also represent these several  conditions of Indian life with reasonable completeness. Their houses  will be seen to form one system of works, from the Long House of the  Iroquois to the Joint Tenement houses of adobe and of stone in New  Mexico, Yucatan, Chiapas, and Guatemala, with such diversities as  the different degrees of advancement of these several tribes would  naturally produce. Studied as one system, springing from a common  experience, and similar wants, and under institutions of the same  general character, they are seen to indicate a plan of life at once  novel, original, and distinctive.    The principal fact, which all these structures alike show, from the  smallest to the greatest, is that the family through these stages of  progress was too weak an organization to face alone the struggle of  life, and sought a shelter for itself in large households composed  of several families. The house for a single family was exceptional  throughout aboriginal America, while the house large enough to  accommodate several families was the rule. Moreover, they were  occupied as joint tenement houses. There was also a tendency to form  these households on the principle of gentile kin, the mothers with  their children being of the same gens or clan.    If we enter upon the great problem of Indian life with a  determination to make it intelligible, their house life and domestic  institutions must furnish the key to its explanation. These pages  are designed as a commencement of that work. It is a fruitful, and,  at present, but partially explored field. We have been singularly  inattentive to the plan of domestic life revealed by the houses of  the aboriginal period. Time and the influences of civilization have  told heavily upon their mode of life until it has become so far  modified, and in many cases entirely overthrown, that it must be  taken up as a new investigation upon the general facts which remain.  At the epoch of European discovery it was in full vitality in North  and South America; but the opportunities of studying its principles  and its results were neglected. As a scheme of life under  established institutions, it was a remarkable display of the  condition of mankind in two well marked ethnical periods, namely,  the Older Period and the Middle Period of barbarism, the first being  represented by the Iroquois and the second by the Aztecs, or ancient  Mexicans. In no part of the earth were these two conditions of human  progress so well represented as by the American Indian tribes. A  knowledge of the culture and of the state of the arts of life in  these periods is indispensable to a definite conception of the  stages of human progress. From the laws which govern this progress,  from the uniformity of their operation, and from the necessary  limitations of the principle of intelligence, we may conclude that  our own remote ancestors passed through a similar experience and  possessed very similar institutions. In studying the condition of  the Indian tribes in these periods we may recover some portion of  the lost history of our own race. This consideration lends incentive  to the investigation.    The first chapter is a condensation of four in \"Ancient Society,\"  namely, those on the gens, phratry, tribe, and confederacy of tribes.  As they formed a necessary part of that work, they become equally  necessary to this. A knowledge of these organizations is  indispensable to an understanding of the house life of the aborigines.  These organizations form the basis of American ethnology. Although  the discussion falls short of a complete explanation of their  character and of their prevalence, it will give the reader a general  idea of the organization of society among them.    We are too apt to look upon the condition of savage and of barbarous  tribes as standing on the same plane with respect to advancement.  They should be carefully distinguished as dissimilar conditions of  progress. Moreover, savagery shows stages of culture and of progress,  and the same is true of barbarism. It will greatly facilitate the  study of the facts relating to these two conditions, through which  mankind have passed in their progress to civilization, to  discriminate between ethnical periods, or stages of culture both in  savagery and in barbarism. The progress of mankind from their  primitive condition to civilization has been marked and eventful.  Each great stage of progress is connected, more or less directly,  with some important invention or discovery which materially  influenced human progress, and inaugurated an improved condition.  For these reasons the period of savagery has been divided into three  subperiods, and that of barbarism also into three, the latter of  which are chiefly important in their relation to the condition of  the Indian tribes. The Older Period of barbarism, which commences  with the introduction of the art of pottery, and the Middle Period,  which commences with the use of adobe brick in the construction of  houses, and with the cultivation of maize and plants by irrigation,  mark two very different and very dissimilar conditions of life. The  larger portion of the Indian tribes fall within one or the other of  these periods. A small portion were in the Older Period of savagery,  and none had reached the Later Period of barbarism, which  immediately precedes civilization. In treating of the condition of  the several tribes they will be assigned to the particular period to  which they severally belong under this classification.    I regret to add that I have not been able, from failing health, to  give to this manuscript the continuous thought which a work of any  kind should receive from its author. But I could not resist the  invitation of my friend Major J. W. Powell, the Director of the  Bureau of Ethnology, to put these chapters together as well as I  might be able, that they might be published by that Bureau. As it  will undoubtedly be my last work, I part with it under some  solicitude for the reason named; but submit it cheerfully to the  indulgence of my readers.    I am greatly indebted to my friend Mr. J. C. Pilling, of the same  Bureau, for his friendly labor and care in correcting the proof  sheets, and for supervising the illustrations. Such favors are very  imperfectly repaid by an author's thanks.    The late William W. Ely, M. D., LL. D., was, for a period of more  than twenty-five years, my cherished friend and literary adviser,  and to him I am indebted for many valuable suggestions, and for  constant encouragement in my labors. The dedication of this volume  to his memory is but a partial expression of my admiration of his  beautiful character, and of my appreciation of his friendship.    LEWIS H. MORGAN    ROCHESTER, N.

W. LUMB, M.A.    With an Introduction by    The Reverend CYRIL ALINGTON, D.D.          AUTHOR'S PREFACE      Greek literature is more modern in its tone than Latin or Medieval or  Elizabethan. It is the expression of a society living in an environment  singularly like our own, mainly democratic, filled with a spirit of free  inquiry, troubled by obstinate feuds and still more obstinate problems.  Militarism, nationalism, socialism and communism were well known, the  preachers of some of these doctrines being loud, ignorant and popular.  The defence of a maritime empire against a military oligarchy was twice  attempted by the most quick-witted people in history, who failed to save  themselves on both occasions. Antecedently then we might expect to find  some lessons of value in the record of a people whose experiences were  like our own.    Further, human thought as expressed in literature is not an unconnected  series of phases; it is one and indivisible. Neglect of either ancient  or modern culture cannot but be a maiming of that great body of  knowledge to which every human being has free access. No man can be  anything but ridiculous who claims to judge European literature while  he knows nothing of the foundations on which it is built. Neither is it  true to say that the ancient world was different from ours. Human nature  at any rate was the same then as it is now, and human character ought to  be the primary object of study. The strange belief that we have somehow  changed for the better has been strong enough to survive the most  devilish war in history, but few hold it who are familiar with the  classics.    Yet in spite of its obvious value Greek literature has been damned and  banned in our enlightened age by some whose sole qualification for the  office of critic often turns out to be a mental darkness about it so  deep that, like that of Egypt, it can be felt. Only those who know Greek  literature have any right to talk about its powers of survival. The  following pages try to show that it is not dead yet, for it has a  distinct message to deliver. The skill with which these neglected  liberators of the human mind united depth of thought with perfection of  form entitles them at least to be heard with patience.          CONTENTS      AUTHOR'S PREFACE.    HOMER    AESCHYLUS    SOPHOCLES    EURIPIDES    ARISTOPHANES    HERODOTUS    THUCYDIDES    PLATO    DEMOSTHENES          INTRODUCTION      I count it an honour to have been asked to write a short introduction to  this book. My only claim to do so is a profound belief in the doctrine  which it advocates, that Greek literature can never die and that it has  a clear and obvious message for us to-day. Those who sat, as I did, on  the recent Committee appointed by Mr. Lloyd George when Prime Minister  to report on the position of the classics in this country, saw good  reason to hope that the prejudice against Greek to which the author  alludes in his preface was passing away: it is a strange piece of irony  that it should ever have been encouraged in the name of Science which  owes to the Greeks so incalculable a debt. We found that, though there  are many parts of the country in which it is almost impossible for a  boy, however great his literary promise, to be taught Greek, there is a  growing readiness to recognise this state of affairs as a scandal, and  wherever Greek was taught, whether to girls or boys, we found a growing  recognition of its supreme literary value. There were some at least of  us who saw with pleasure that where only one classical language can be  studied there is an increasing readiness to regard Greek as a possible  alternative to Latin.    On this last point, no doubt, classical scholars will continue to  differ, but as to the supreme excellence of the Greek contribution to  literature there can be no difference of opinion. Those to whom the  names of this volume recall some of the happiest hours they have spent  in literary study will be grateful to Mr. Lumb for helping others to  share the pleasures which they have so richly enjoyed; he writes with  an enthusiasm which is infectious, and those to whom his book comes as  a first introduction to the great writers of Greece will be moved to  try to learn more of men whose works after so many centuries inspire so  genuine an affection and teach lessons so modern. They need have no  fear that they will be disappointed, for Mr. Lumb's zeal is based on  knowledge. I hope that this book will be the means of leading many to  appreciate what has been done for the world by the most amazing of all  its cities, and some at least to determine that they will investigate  its treasures for themselves. They will find like the Queen of Sheba  that, though much has been told them, the half remains untold.    C. A. ALINGTON.            HOMER      Greek literature opens with a problem of the first magnitude. Two  splendid Epics have been preserved which are ascribed to \"Homer\", yet  few would agree that Homer wrote them both. Many authorities have denied  altogether that such a person ever existed; it seems certain that he  could not have been the author of both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_,  for the latter describes a far more advanced state of society; it is  still an undecided question whether the _Iliad_ was written in Europe  or in Asia, but the probability is that the _Odyssey_ is of European  origin; the date of the poems it is very difficult to gauge, though  the best authorities place it somewhere in the eighth century B.C.  Fortunately these difficulties do not interfere with our enjoyment of  the two poems; if there were two Homers, we may be grateful to Nature  for bestowing her favours so liberally upon us; if Homer never existed  at all, but is a mere nickname for a class of singer, the literary  fraud that has been perpetrated is no more serious than that which has  assigned Apocalyptic visions of different ages to Daniel. Perhaps the  Homeric poems are the growth of many generations, like the English  parish churches; they resemble them as being examples of the exquisite  effects which may be produced when the loving care and the reverence of  a whole people blend together in different ages pieces of artistic work  whose authors have been content to remain unnamed.    It is of some importance to remember that the Iliad is not the story of  the whole Trojan war, but only of a very small episode which was worked  out in four days. The real theme is the Wrath of Achilles. In the tenth  year of the siege the Greeks had captured a town called Chryse. Among  the captives were two maidens, one Chryseis, the daughter of Chryses, a  priest of Apollo, the other Briseis; the former had fallen to the lot  of Agamemnon, the King of the Greek host, the latter to Achilles his  bravest follower. Chryses, father of Chryseis, went to Agamemnon to  ransom his daughter, but was treated with contumely; accordingly he  prayed to the god to avenge him and was answered, for Apollo sent a  pestilence upon the Greeks which raged for nine days, destroying man and  beast. On the tenth day the chieftains held a counsel to discover the  cause of the malady. At it Chalcas the seer before revealing the truth  obtained the promise of Achilles' protection; when Agamemnon learned  that he was to ransom his captive, his anger burst out against the seer  and he demanded another prize in return. Achilles upbraided his greed,  begging him to wait till Troy was taken, when he would be rewarded  fourfold. Agamemnon in reply threatened to take Achilles' captive  Briseis, at the same time describing his follower's character. \"Thou  art the most hateful to me of all Kings sprung of Zeus, for thou lovest  alway strife and wars and battles. Mighty though thou art, thy might is  the gift of some god. Briseis I will take, that thou mayest know how  far stronger I am than thou, and that another may shrink from deeming  himself my equal, rivalling me to my face.\" At this insult Achilles half  drew his sword to slay the King, but was checked by Pallas Athena, who  bade him confine his resentment to taunts, for the time would come when  Agamemnon would offer him splendid gifts to atone for the wrong. Obeying  the goddess Achilles reviled his foe, swearing a solemn oath that he  would not help the Greeks when Hector swept them away. In vain did  Nestor, the wise old counsellor who had seen two generations of heroes,  try to make up the quarrel, beseeching Agamemnon not to outrage his best  warrior and Achilles not to contend with his leader. The meeting broke  up; Achilles departed to his huts, whence the heralds in obedience to  Agamemnon speedily carried away Briseis.    Going down to the sea-shore Achilles called upon Thetis his mother to  whom he told the story of his ill-treatment. In deep pity for his fate  (for he was born to a life of a short span), she promised that she  would appeal to Zeus to help him to his revenge; she had saved Zeus from  destruction by summoning the hundred-armed Briareus to check a revolt  among the gods against Zeus' authority. For the moment the king of the  gods was absent in Aethiopia; when he returned to Olympus on the twelfth  day she would win him over. Ascending to heaven, she obtained the  promise of Zeus' assistance, not without raising the suspicions of Zeus'  jealous consort Hera; a quarrel between them was averted by their son  Hephaestus, whose ungainly performance of the duties of cupbearer to the  Immortals made them forget all resentments in laughter unquenchable.    True to his promise Zeus sent a dream to Agamemnon to assure him that he  would at last take Troy. The latter determined to summon an Assembly of  the host. In it the changeable temper of the Greeks is vividly pictured.  First Agamemnon told how he had the promise of immediate triumph; when  the army eagerly called for"]]]
