The swamp lies in north-eastern Indiana,  nearly one hundred miles south of the Michigan line and ten  west of the Ohio.  In its day it covered a large area.  When  I arrived; there were miles of unbroken forest, lakes provided  with boats for navigation, streams of running water, the roads  around the edges corduroy, made by felling and sinking large trees  in the muck.  Then the Winter Swamp had all the lacy  exquisite  beauty  of such locations when snow and frost draped, while from  May until October it was practically tropical jungle.  From it I  have sent to scientists flowers and vines not then classified  and illustrated in our botanies.    It was a piece of forethought to work unceasingly  at that time,  for soon commerce attacked the swamp and began its usual process of  devastation.  Canadian lumbermen came seeking tall straight  timber for ship masts and tough heavy trees for beams.  Grand  Rapids followed and stripped the forest of hard wood for fine  furniture, and through my experience with the lumber men \"Freckles\"'  story  was written.  Afterward hoop and stave men and local mills  took the best of the soft wood.  Then a ditch, in reality a canal,  was dredged across the north end through, my best territory, and  that carried the water to the Wabash River until oil men could  enter the swamp.  From that time the wealth they drew to the  surface constantly materialized in macadamized roads, cosy homes,  and big farms of unsurpassed richness, suitable for growing onions,  celery, sugar beets, corn and potatoes, as repeatedly has been  explained in everything I have written of the place.  Now, the  Limberlost exists only in ragged spots and patches, but so rich  was it in the beginning that there is yet a wealth of work for  a lifetime remaining to me in these, and river thickets.  I ask  no better hunting grounds for birds, moths, and flowers.  The  fine roads are a convenience, and settled farms a protection,  to be taken into consideration, when bewailing its dismantling.    It is quite true that \"One man's meat is another's poison.\"  When poor Limber, lost and starving in the fastnesses of the  swamp, gave to it a name, afterward to be on the lips of millions;  to him it was deadly  poison.  To me it has been of unspeakable  interest, unceasing work of joyous nature, and meat in full measure,  with occasional sweetbreads by  way  of a treat.    Primarily, I went to the swamp to study and reproduce the birds.  I never thought they could have a rival in my  heart.  But these  fragile night wanderers, these moonflowers of June's darkness,  literally \"thrust themselves upon me.\"  When my cameras were  placed before the home of a pair of birds, the bushes parted to  admit light, and clinging to them I found a creature, often having  the bird's sweep of wing, of colour pale green with decorations  of lavender and yellow or running the gamut from palest tans  darkest browns, with markings, of pink or dozens of other  irresistible combinations of colour, the feathered folk found a  competitor that often outdistanced them in my affections, for  I am captivated easily by colour, and beauty  of form.    At first, these moths made studies of exquisite beauty, I merely  stopped a few seconds to reproduce them, before proceeding  with my work.  Soon I found myself filling the waiting time,  when birds were slow in coming before the cameras, when clouds  obscured the light too much for fast exposures, or on grey days,  by searching for moths.  Then in collecting abandoned nests,  cocoons were found on limbs, inside stumps, among leaves when  gathering nuts, or queer shining pupae-cases came to light as  I lifted wild flowers in the fall.  All these were carried to my  little conservatory, placed in as natural conditions as possible,  and studies were made from the moths that emerged the following  spring.  I am not sure but that \"Moths of Limberlost Cabin\"  would be the most appropriate title for this book.    Sometimes, before I had finished with them, they paired, mated,  and dotted everything with fertile eggs, from which tiny  caterpillars soon would emerge.  It became a matter of intense  interest to provide their natural foods and raise them.  That  started me to watching for caterpillars and eggs out of doors,  and friends of my work began carrying them to me.  Repeatedly,  I have gone through the entire life process, from mating newly  emerged moths, the egg period, caterpillar life, with its  complicated moults and changes, the spinning of the cocoons,  the miraculous winter sleep, to the spring appearance;  and with  my cameras recorded each stage of development.  Then on platinum  paper, printed so lightly from these negatives as to give only  an exact reproduction of forms, and with water colour medium  copied each mark, line and colour gradation in most cases from  the living moth at its prime.  Never was the study of birds so  interesting.    The illustration of every moth book I ever have seen, that  attempted coloured reproduction, proved by the shrivelled bodies  and unnatural position of the wings, that it had been painted from  objects mounted from weeks to years in private collections or  museums.  A lifeless moth fades rapidly under the most favourable  conditions.  A moth at eight days of age, in the last stages of  decline, is from four to six distinct shades lighter in colour  than at six hours from the cocoon, when it is dry, and ready  for flight.  As soon as circulation stops, and the life juices  evaporate from the wings and body, the colour grows many shades paler.  If exposed to light, moths soon fade almost beyond recognition.    I make no claim to being an entomologist;  I quite agree with the  \"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table\", that \"the subject is too vast  for any single human intelligence to grasp.\"  If my life depended  upon it I could not give the scientific name of every least organ  and nerve of a moth, and as for wrestling with the thousands of  tiny species of day and night or even attempting all the  ramifications of--say the alluringly beautiful Catocalae family--life  is too short, unless devoted to this purpose alone.  But if  I frankly confess my limitations, and offer the book to my  nature-loving friends merely as an introduction to the most  exquisite creation of the swamp; and the outside history, as it  were, of the evolution of these creatures from moth to moth again,  surely no one can feel defrauded.  Since the publication of  \"A Girl of the Limberlost\", I have received hundreds of letters  asking me to write of my experiences with the lepidoptera of the  swamp.  This book professes to be nothing more.    Because so many  enemies prey  upon the large night moths in all  stages, they  are nowhere sufficiently numerous to be pests, or  common enough to be given local names, as have the birds.  I have  been compelled to use their scientific names to assist in  identification, and at times I have had to resort to technical terms,  because there were no other.  Frequently I have written of them under  the names by which I knew them in childhood, or that we of Limberlost  Cabin have bestowed upon them.    There is a wide gulf between a Naturalist and a Nature Lover.  A  Naturalist devotes his life to delving into stiff scientific  problems concerning everything in nature from her greatest to her  most minute forms.  A Nature Lover works at any occupation and  finds recreation in being out of doors and appreciating the common  things of life as they appeal to his senses.    The Naturalist always begins at the beginning and traces family,  sub-family, genus and species.  He deals in Latin and Greek terms  of resounding and disheartening combinations.  At his hands anatomy  and markings become lost in a scientific jargon of patagia, jugum,  discocellulars, phagocytes, and so on to the end of the volume.  For one who would be a Naturalist, a rare specimen indeed, there are  many  volumes on the market.  The list of pioneer lepidopterists  begins authoritatively with Linnaeus and since his time you can  make your selection from the works of Druce, Grote, Strecker,  Boisduval, Robinson, Smith, Butler, Fernald, Beutenmuller, Hicks,  Rothschild, Hampson, Stretch, Lyman, or any of a dozen others.  Possessing such an imposing array of names there should be no  necessity to add to them.  These men have impaled moths and  dissected, magnified and located brain, heart and nerves.  After  finishing the interior they have given to the most minute exterior  organ from two to three inches of Latin name.  From them we learn  that it requires a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus, ungues,  pulvillus, and anterior, medial and posterior spurs to provide a  leg for a moth."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4908"],[0,"Five of Maxwell's Papers (#1)"],[1,"eBook includes 5 papers or speeches by James Clerk Maxwell.    The contents are:       Foramen Centrale     Theory of Compound Colours     Poinsot's Theory     Address to the Mathematical     Introductory Lecture          On the Unequal Sensibility of the Foramen Centrale to Light of  different Colours.    James Clerk Maxwell      [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]      When observing the spectrum formed by looking at a long ve rtical slit  through a simple prism, I noticed an elongated dark spot running up  and down in the blue, and following the motion of the eye as it moved  _up and down_ the spectrum, but refusing to pass out of the blue into  the other colours.  It was plain that the spot belonged both to the  eye and to the blue part of the spectrum.  The result to which I have  come is, that the appearance is due to the yellow spot on the retina,  commonly called the _Foramen Centrale_ of Soemmering.  The most  convenient method of observing the spot is by presenting to the eye in  not too rapid succession, blue and yellow glasses, or, still better,  allowing blue and yellow papers to revolve slowly before the eye.  In  this way the spot is seen in the blue.  It fades rapidly, but is  renewed every time the yellow comes in to relieve the effect of the  blue.  By using a Nicol's prism along with this apparatus, the brushes  of Haidinger are well seen in connexion with the spot, and the fact of  the brushes being the spot analysed by polarized light becomes  evident.  If we look steadily at an object behind a series of bright  bars which move in front of it, we shall see a curious bending of the  bars as they come up to the place of the yellow spot.  The part which  comes over the spot seems to start in advance of the rest of the bar,  and this would seem to indicate a greater rapidity of sensation at the  yellow spot than in the surrounding retina.  But I find the experiment  difficult, and I hope for better results from more accurate observers.          On the Theory of Compound Colours with reference to Mixtures of  Blue and Yellow Light.    James Clerk Maxwell      [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]      When we mix together blue and yellow paint, we obtain green paint.  This fact is well known to all who have handled colours; and it is  universally admitted that blue and yellow make green.  Red, yellow,  and blue, being the primary colours among painters, green is regarded  as a secondary colour, arising from the mixture of blue and yellow.  Newton, however, found that the green of the spectrum was not the same  thing as the mixture of two colours of the spectrum, for such a  mixture could be separated by the prism, while the green of the  spectrum resisted further decomposition.  But still it was believed  that yellow and blue would make a green, though not that of the  spectrum.  As far as I am aware, the first experiment on the subject  is that of M. Plateau, who, before 1819, made a disc with alternate  sectors of prussian blue and gamboge, and observed that, when  spinning, the resultant tint was not green, but a neutral gray,  inclining sometimes to yellow or blue, but never to green.  Prof. J. D. Forbes of Edinburgh made similar experiments in 1849, with  the same result.  Prof. Helmholtz of Konigsberg, to whom we owe the  most complete investigation on visible colour, has given the true  explanation of this phenomenon.  The result of mixing two coloured  powders is not by any means the same as mixing the beams of light  which flow from each separately.  In the latter case we receive all  the light which comes either from the one powder or the other.  In the  former, much of the light coming from one powder falls on particles of  the other, and we receive only that portion which has escaped  absorption by one or other.  Thus the light coming from a mixture of  blue and yellow powder, consists partly of light coming directly from  blue particles or yellow particles, and partly of light acted on by  both blue and yellow particles.  This latter light is green, since the  blue stops the red, yellow, and orange, and the yellow stops the blue  and violet.  I have made experiments on the mixture of blue and yellow  light--by rapid rotation, by combined reflexion and transmission, by  viewing them out of focus, in stripes, at a great distance, by  throwing the colours of the spectrum on a screen, and by receiving  them into the eye directly; and I have arranged a portable apparatus  by which any one may see the result of this or any other mixture of  the colours of the spectrum.  In all these cases blue and yellow do  not make green.  I have also made experiments on the mixture of  coloured powders.  Those which I used principally were \"mineral blue\"  (from copper) and \"chrome-yellow.\"  Other blue and yellow pigments gave  curious results, but it was more difficult to make the mixtures, and  the greens were less uniform in tint.  The mixtures of these colours  were made by weight, and were painted on discs of paper, which were  afterwards treated in the manner described in my paper \"On Colour as  perceived by the Eye,\" in the _Transactions of the Royal Society of  Edinburgh_, Vol. XXI. Part 2.  The visible effect of the colour is  estimated in terms of the standard-coloured papers:--vermilion (V),  ultramarine (U), and emerald-green (E).  The accuracy of the results,  and their significance, can be best understood by referring to the  paper before mentioned.  I shall denote mineral blue by B, and  chrome-yellow by Y; and B3 Y5 means a mixture of three parts blue and  five parts yellow.           Given Colour.     Standard Colours.

It  will be seen that the first admixture of yellow _diminishes_ the  brightness of the blue.  The negative values of U indicate that a  mixture of V, U, and E cannot be made equivalent to the given colour.  The experiments from which these results were taken had the negative  values transferred to the other side of the equation.  They were all  made by means of the colour-top, and were verified by repetition at  different times.  It may be necessary to remark, in conclusion, with  reference to the mode of registering visible colours in terms of three  arbitrary standard colours, that it proceeds upon that theory of three  primary elements in the sensation of colour, which treats the  investigation of the laws of visible colour as a branch of human  physiology, incapable of being deduced from the laws of light itself,  as set forth in physical optics.  It takes advantage of the methods of  optics to study vision itself; and its appeal is not to physical  principles, but to our consciousness of our own sensations.          On an Instrument to illustrate Poinsot's Theory of Rotation.    James Clerk Maxwell      [From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]      In studying the rotation of a solid body according to Poinsot's  method, we have to consider the successive positions of the  instantaneous axis of rotation with reference both to directions fixed  in space and axes assumed in the moving body.  The paths traced out by  the pole of this axis on the _invariable plane_ and on the _central  ellipsoid_ form interesting subjects of mathematical investigation.  But when we attempt to follow with our eye the motion of a rotating  body, we find it difficult to determine through what point of the  _body_ the instantaneous axis passes at any time,--and to determine its  path must be still more difficult.  I have endeavoured to render  visible the path of the instantaneous axis, and to vary the  circumstances of motion, by means of a top of the same kind as that  used by Mr Elliot, to illustrate precession*.  The body of the  instrument is a hollow cone of wood, rising from a ring, 7 inches in  diameter and 1 inch thick.  An iron axis, 8 inches long, screws into  the vertex of the cone.  The lower extremity has a point of hard  steel, which rests in an agate cup, and forms the support of the  instrument.  An iron nut, three ounces in weight, is made to screw on  the axis, and to be fixed at any point; and in the wooden ring are  screwed four bolts, of three ounces, working horizontally, and four  bolts, of one ounce, working vertically.  On the upper part of the  axis is placed a disc of card, on which are drawn four concentric  rings.  Each ring is divided into four quadrants, which are coloured  red, yellow, green, and blue.  The spaces between the rings are white.  When the top is in motion, it is easy to see in which quadrant the  instantaneous axis is at any moment and the distance between it and  the axis of the instrument; and we observe,--1st. That the  instantaneous axis travels in a closed curve, and returns to its  original position in the body.  2ndly. That by working the vertical  bolts, we can make the axis of the instrument the centre of this  closed curve.  It will then be one of the principal axes of inertia.  3rdly. That, by working the nut on the axis, we can make the order of  colours either red, yellow, green, blue, or the reverse.  When "]]]
