Fifteen years ago, in announcing what was then a list of prospective  books, the writer declared his intention to publish a \"Scrap Book,\"  promising that it should be a choice selection of his miscellaneous  writings, and mentioned as among the probable articles, Corianton, a  Book of Mormon story; Mariam, a story of Zarahemla; Spirit Promptings,  etc., etc., all which are here recalled as foreshadowing the author's  intention at that time. About then, however, the writer's energies  began to be devoted more exclusively to doctrinal and historical  themes, and one circumstance after another arose which called him to  the defense of the Mormon faith and the Mormon people, so that the  character of his literary efforts were turned away from the line of  purpose fiction work he had proposed to himself. But the scrap-book,  nevertheless, became a possibility through the multiplication of the  defensive articles, though its character would be changed, owing the  change in the writer's line of work. Through the years have elapsed  since the \"Scrap Book\" idea was first entertained as a depository of  the author's miscellaneous writings, a great mass of material in the  form of discourses and papers, contributed to magazines and newspapers  has accumulated and it is from this mass of materials that following  collection of articles has been chosen; and as there is still much  material on hand, and the end of the writer's work is not yet in  sight, he has ventured to call this Volume I, indicating by that the  probability that other volumes in time will follow, if the writer is  not mistaken in his judgment as to the demand for such publications.

Position and Defense.        I.    MORMONISM.    FOREWORD.    The following paper was prepared by the writer for presentation at the  Parliament of Religions, held at the World's Columbian Exposition,  Chicago, 1893. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was not  invited to participate in the proceedings of that Parliament, although  Mormonism is the most distinctively American religious movement yet  developed in our country; and as such the position and doctrine of  the Church should have been of special interest in such a gathering  as the Parliament purported to be. Learning that the Church would not  be invited to the Parliament, under a sense of duty to make known  the faith and message to the world, her presiding authorities sought  opportunity for a hearing from the Parliament platform. After much  solicitation and persistent urging as to the right of the Church to  a hearing in such a gathering, a reluctant consent was finally given  for a presentation of the following paper. But after this consent was  given, a very unworthy effort was made by the President and chairman  of the Parliament to side-track the paper by asking the representative  of the Church to read it in one of the auxiliary departments of the  Parliament,--namely, the Scientific Department, which meetings were  held in a room capable of accommodating about fifty hearers, and  presided over by Mr. Mervin Marie Snell. In response to that suggestion  the writer, who had the honor to the representative of the Church to  the Parliament, replied that such a hearing as could be had in Hall  III (Scientific Department of the Parliament) was not the kind of  hearing the Mormon Church had asked for or could accept. She had asked  to speak from the same platform from which the great religious faiths  had spoken--Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism--from the platform  of Columbus Hall, where her position and principles could be compared  and contrasted with the viewpoint and doctrines of other religions,  by the enlightened thought of the age. The officers in charge of the  Parliament, however, refused to change the terms on which a hearing  could be obtained for Mormonism, and the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints had the distinction of being refused a hearing in the  World's Parliament of Religions.    I.    \"MORMONISM.\"    One of the most instructive as well as the most important religious  movements of the nineteenth century is the rise of what the world  has learned to call \"Mormonism.\" In an age which believed that  God's voice would no more be heard giving revelation; that said the  volume of scripture was completed and forever closed; that declared  angels would no more visit the earth to communicate the divine will;  and that sedulously taught that all miracles had ceased--the world  beholds a religion arising based upon these forces that men had been  taught to believe had forever become inactive. True, it has met with  many obstacles in consequence of making these rejected stones of  ancient Christianity the chief corner stones of its structure; but  notwithstanding the fierceness of the opposition it has aroused, it is  now so firmly established that it claims the respectful attention of  the world.    New religions, when struggling for existence in the face of adversity,  with few followers and no influence, may expect to be treated with  silent contempt by the supposedly orthodox; but when a religion has  fought its way through all opposition to a position of influence, and  counts within its pale hundreds of thousands of sincere and intelligent  followers, it gives proof that its doctrines contain some measure  of truth at least, and by reason of that fact, has a claim upon the  respect and thoughtful consideration of mankind.    Such is the position of \"Mormonism.\" Sixty-three years ago [A] the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized with but  six members, in the State of New York. That organization was effected  in a log room not more than fourteen feet square, by men who made no  pretensions to ecclesiastical scholarship, but claimed to be directed  by divine revelation. It could but be expected that the great Christian  sects, by which the new church was surrounded, and that considered  themselves strongly entrenched behind a fullness of religious  truth--would scoff at the pretensions of these men. But when, after  a lapse of sixty-three years, the work having so humble an origin is  still in existence with a membership of over three hundred thousand,  it is time the scoffing ceased and earnest attention be given to its  pretensions, especially when account is taken of its history between  the two points indicated--its origin and present standing.

The times through which we are passing have  afforded to many of us a confirmation of our faith.  We see that the  things we had thought evil are really evil, and we know more  definitely than we ever did before the directions in which men must  move if a better world is to arise on the ruins of the one which is  now hurling itself into destruction.  We see that men's political  dealings with one another are based on wholly wrong ideals, and can  only be saved by quite different ideals from continuing to be a source  of suffering, devastation, and sin.    Political ideals must be based upon ideals for the individual life.  The aim of politics should be to make the lives of individuals as good  as possible.  There is nothing for the politician to consider outside  or above the various men, women, and children who compose the world.  The problem of politics is to adjust the relations of human beings in  such a way that each severally may have as much of good in his  existence as possible.  And this problem requires that we should first  consider what it is that we think good in the individual life.    To begin with, we do not want all men to be alike.  We do not want to  lay down a pattern or type to which men of all sorts are to be made by  some means or another to approximate.  This is the ideal of the  impatient administrator.  A bad teacher will aim at imposing his  opinion, and turning out a set of pupils all of whom will give the  same definite answer on a doubtful point.  Mr. Bernard Shaw is said to  hold that _Troilus and Cressida_ is the best of Shakespeare's plays.  Although I disagree with this opinion, I should welcome it in a pupil  as a sign of individuality; but most teachers would not tolerate such  a heterodox view.  Not only teachers, but all commonplace persons in  authority, desire in their subordinates that kind of uniformity which  makes their actions easily predictable and never inconvenient.  The  result is that they crush initiative and individuality when they can,  and when they cannot, they quarrel with it.    It is not one ideal for all men, but a separate ideal for each  separate man, that has to be realized if possible.  Every man has it  in his being to develop into something good or bad: there is a best  possible for him, and a worst possible.  His circumstances will  determine whether his capacities for good are developed or crushed,  and whether his bad impulses are strengthened or gradually diverted  into better channels.    But although we cannot set up in any detail an ideal of character  which is to be universally applicable--although we cannot say, for  instance, that all men ought to be industrious, or self-sacrificing,  or fond of music--there are some broad principles which can be used to  guide our estimates as to what is possible or desirable.    We may distinguish two sorts of goods, and two corresponding sorts of  impulses.  There are goods in regard to which individual possession is  possible, and there are goods in which all can share alike.  The food  and clothing of one man is not the food and clothing of another; if  the supply is insufficient, what one man has is obtained at the  expense of some other man.  This applies to material goods generally,  and therefore to the greater part of the present economic life of the  world.  On the other hand, mental and spiritual goods do not belong to  one man to the exclusion of another.  If one man knows a science, that  does not prevent others from knowing it; on the contrary, it helps  them to acquire the knowledge.  If one man is a great artist or poet,  that does not prevent others from painting pictures or writing poems,  but helps to create the atmosphere in which such things are possible.  If one man is full of good-will toward others, that does not mean that  there is less good-will to be shared among the rest; the more  good-will one man has, the more he is likely to create among others.  In such matters there is no _possession_, because there is not a  definite amount to be shared; any increase anywhere tends to produce  an increase everywhere.    There are two kinds of impulses, corresponding to the two kinds of  goods.  There are _possessive_ impulses, which aim at acquiring or  retaining private goods that cannot be shared; these center in the  impulse of property.  And there are _creative_ or constructive impulses,  which aim at bringing into the world or making available for use the  kind of goods in which there is no privacy and no possession.    The best life is the one in which the creative impulses play the  largest part and the possessive impulses the smallest.  This is no new  discovery.  The Gospel says: \"Take no thought, saying, What shall we  eat? or What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\"  The thought we give to these things is taken away from matters of more  importance.  And what is worse, the habit of mind engendered by  thinking of these things is a bad one; it leads to competition, envy,  domination, cruelty, and almost all the moral evils that infest the  world.  In particular, it leads to the predatory use of force.  Material possessions can be taken by force and enjoyed by the robber.  Spiritual possessions cannot be taken in this way.  You may kill an  artist or a thinker, but you cannot acquire his art or his thought.  You may put a man to death because he loves his fellow-men, but you  will not by so doing acquire the love which made his happiness.  Force  is impotent in such matters; it is only as regards material goods that  it is effective.  For this reason the men who believe in force are the  men whose thoughts and desires are preoccupied with material goods.    The possessive impulses, when they are strong, infect activities which  ought to be purely creative.  A man who has made some valuable  discovery may be filled with jealousy of a rival discoverer.  If one  man has found a cure for cancer and another has found a cure for  consumption, one of them may be delighted if the other man's discovery  turns out a mistake, instead of regretting the suffering of patients  which would otherwise have been avoided.  In such cases, instead of  desiring knowledge for its own sake, or for the sake of its  usefulness, a man is desiring it as a means to reputation.  Every  creative impulse is shadowed by a possessive impulse; even the  aspirant to saintliness may be jealous of the more successful saint.  Most affection is accompanied by some tinge of jealousy, which is a  possessive impulse intruding into the creative region.  Worst of all,  in this direction, is the sheer envy of those who have missed  everything worth having in life, and who are instinctively bent on  preventing others from enjoying what they have not had.  There is  often much of this in the attitude of the old toward the young.    There is in human beings, as in plants and animals, a certain natural  impulse of growth, and this is just as true of mental as of physical  development.  Physical development is helped by air and nourishment  and exercise, and may be hindered by the sort of treatment which made  Chinese women's feet small.  In just the same way mental development  may be helped or hindered by outside influences.  The outside  influences that help are those that merely provide encouragement or  mental food or opportunities for exercising mental faculties.  The  influences that hinder are those that interfere with growth by  applying any kind of force, whether discipline or authority or fear or  the tyranny of public opinion or the necessity of engaging in some  totally incongenial occupation.  Worst of all influences are those  that thwart or twist a man's fundamental impulse, which is what shows  itself as conscience in the moral sphere; such influences are likely  to do a man an inward danger from which he will never recover.    Those who realize the harm that can be done to others by any use of  force against them, and the worthlessness of the goods that can be  acquired by force, will be very full of respect for the liberty of  others; they will not try to bind them or fetter them; they will be  slow to judge and swift to sympathize; they will treat every human  being with a kind of tenderness, because the principle of good in him  is at once fragile and infinitely precious.  They will not condemn  those who are unlike themselves; they will know and feel that  individuality brings differences and uniformity means death.  They  will wish each human being to be as much a living thing and as little  a mechanical product as it is possible to be; they will cherish in  each one just those things which the harsh usage of a ruthless world  would destroy.  In one word, all their dealings with others will be  inspired by a deep impulse of _reverence_.    What we shall desire for individuals is now clear: strong creative  impulses, overpowering and absorbing the instinct of possession;  reverence for others; respect for the fundamental creative impulse in  ourselves.  A certain kind of self-respect or native pride is  necessary to a good life; a man must not have a sense of utter inward  defeat if he is to remain whole, but must feel the courage and the  hope and the will to live by the best that is in him, whatever outward  or inward obstacles it may encounter.  So far as it lies in a man's  own power, his life will realize its best possibilities if it has  three things: creative rather than possessive impulses, reverence for  others, and respect for the "]]]
