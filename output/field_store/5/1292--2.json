DEDICATION          To the Right Honourable    THOMAS, EARL OF PEMBROKE, &C.,    Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter and one of    the Lords of Her Majesty's most honourable privy council.    My Lord,    You will perhaps wonder that an obscure person, who has not the honour to  be known to your lordship, should presume to address you in this manner.  But that a man who has written something with a design to promote Useful  Knowledge and Religion in the world should make choice of your lordship  for his patron, will not be thought strange by any one that is not  altogether unacquainted with the present state of the church and  learning, and consequently ignorant how great an ornament and support you  are to both. Yet, nothing could have induced me to make you this present  of my poor endeavours, were I not encouraged by that candour and native  goodness which is so bright a part in your lordship's character. I might  add, my lord, that the extraordinary favour and bounty you have been  pleased to show towards our Society gave me hopes you would not be  unwilling to countenance the studies of one of its members. These  considerations determined me to lay this treatise at your lordship's  feet, and the rather because I was ambitious to have it known that I am  with the truest and most profound respect, on account of that learning  and virtue which the world so justly admires in your lordship, MY LORD,  Your lordship's most humble and most devoted servant,      GEORGE BERKELEY        * * * * *      CONTENTS      PREFACE    INTRODUCTION    OF THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE      * * * * *        PREFACE      What I here make public has, after a long and scrupulous inquiry, seemed  to me evidently true and not unuseful to be known--particularly to those  who are tainted with Scepticism, or want a demonstration of the existence  and immateriality of God, or the natural immortality of the soul. Whether  it be so or no I am content the reader should impartially examine; since  I do not think myself any farther concerned for the success of what I  have written than as it is agreeable to truth. But, to the end this may  not suffer, I make it my request that the reader suspend his judgment  till he has once at least read the whole through with that degree of  attention and thought which the subject-matter shall seem to deserve.  For, as there are some passages that, taken by themselves, are very  liable (nor could it be remedied) to gross misinterpretation, and to be  charged with most absurd consequences, which, nevertheless, upon an  entire perusal will appear not to follow from them; so likewise, though  the whole should be read over, yet, if this be done transiently, it is  very probable my sense may be mistaken; but to a thinking reader, I  flatter myself it will be throughout clear and obvious. As for the  characters of novelty and singularity which some of the following notions  may seem to bear, it is, I hope, needless to make any apology on that  account. He must surely be either very weak, or very little acquainted  with the sciences, who shall reject a truth that is capable of  demonstration, for no other reason but because it is newly known, and  contrary to the prejudices of mankind. Thus much I thought fit to  premise, in order to prevent, if possible, the hasty censures of a sort  of men who are too apt to condemn an opinion before they rightly  comprehend it.          INTRODUCTION      1. Philosophy being nothing else but THE STUDY OF WISDOM AND TRUTH, it  may with reason be expected that those who have spent most time and pains  in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind, a greater  clearness and evidence of knowledge, and be less disturbed with doubts  and difficulties than other men. Yet so it is, we see the illiterate bulk  of mankind that walk the high-road of plain common sense, and are  governed by the dictates of nature, for the most part easy and  undisturbed. To them nothing THAT IS FAMILIAR appears unaccountable or  difficult to comprehend. They complain not of any want of evidence in  their senses, and are out of all danger of becoming SCEPTICS. But no  sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a  superior principle, to reason, meditate, and reflect on the nature of  things, but a thousand scruples spring up in our minds concerning those  things which before we seemed fully to comprehend. Prejudices and errors  of sense do from all parts discover themselves to our view; and,  endeavouring to correct these by reason, we are insensibly drawn into  uncouth paradoxes, difficulties, and inconsistencies, which multiply and  grow upon us as we advance in speculation, till at length, having  wandered through many intricate mazes, we find ourselves just where we  were, or, which is worse, sit down in a forlorn Scepticism.    2. The cause of this is thought to be the obscurity of things, or the  natural weakness and imperfection of our understandings. It is said, the  faculties we have are few, and those designed by nature for the SUPPORT  and comfort of life, and not to penetrate into the INWARD ESSENCE and  constitution of things. Besides, the mind of man being finite, when it  treats of things which partake of infinity, it is not to be wondered at  if it run into absurdities and contradictions, out of which it is  impossible it should ever extricate itself, it being of the nature of  infinite not to be comprehended by that which is finite.    3. But, perhaps, we may be too partial to ourselves in placing the fault  originally in our faculties, and not rather in the wrong use we make of  them. IT IS A HARD THING TO SUPPOSE THAT RIGHT DEDUCTIONS FROM TRUE  PRINCIPLES SHOULD EVER END IN CONSEQUENCES WHICH CANNOT BE MAINTAINED or  made consistent. We should believe that God has dealt more bountifully  with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge  which he had placed quite out of their reach. This were not agreeable to  the wonted indulgent methods of Providence, which, whatever appetites it  may have implanted in the creatures, doth usually furnish them with such  means as, if rightly made use of, will not fail to satisfy them. Upon the  whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of  those difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked  up the way to knowledge, are entirely owing to ourselves--that we have  first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.    4. My purpose therefore is, to try if I can discover what those  Principles are which have introduced all that doubtfulness and  uncertainty, those absurdities and contradictions, into the several sects  of philosophy; insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance  incurable, conceiving it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation  of our faculties. And surely it is a work well deserving our pains to  make a strict inquiry concerning the First Principles of Human Knowledge,  to sift and examine them on all sides, especially since there may be some  grounds to suspect that those lets and difficulties, which stay and  embarrass the mind in its search after truth, do not spring from any  darkness and intricacy in the objects, or natural defect in the  understanding, so much as from false Principles which have been insisted  on, and might have been avoided.    5. How difficult and discouraging soever this attempt may seem, when I  consider how many great and extraordinary men have gone before me in the  like designs, yet I am not without some hopes--upon the consideration  that the largest views are not always the clearest, and that he who is  short--sighted will be obliged to draw the object nearer, and may,  perhaps, by a close and narrow survey, discern that which had escaped far  better eyes.    6. A CHIEF SOURCE OF ERROR IN ALL PARTS OF KNOWLEDGE.--In order to  prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what  follows, it is proper to premise somewhat, by way of Introduction,  concerning the nature and abuse of Language. But the unravelling this  matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design, by taking notice  of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate  and perplexed, and to have occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties  in almost all parts of knowledge. And that is the opinion that the mind  has a power of framing ABSTRACT IDEAS or notions of things. He who is  not a perfect stranger to the writings and disputes of philosophers must  needs acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract  ideas. These are in a more especial manner thought to be the object of  those sciences which go by the name of LOGIC and METAPHYSICS, and of all  that which passes under the notion of the most abstracted and sublime  learning, in all which one shall scarce find any question handled in such  a manner as does not suppose their existence in the mind, and that it is  well acquainted with them.    7. PROPER ACCEPTATION OF ABSTRACTION.--It is agreed on all hands that the  qualities or modes of things do never REALLY EXIST EACH OF THEM APART BY  ITSELF, and separated from all others, but are mixed, as it were, and  blended together, several in the same object. But, we are told, the mind  being able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those other  qualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself  abstract ideas. For example, there is perceived by sight an object  extended, coloured, and moved: this mixed or compound idea the mind  resolving into its simple, constituent parts, and viewing each by itself,  exclusive of the rest, does frame the abstract ideas of extension,"]]]
