The interest shown by the public in the simple and true account of  every-day life in New Zealand, published by the author three years  ago, has encouraged her to enlarge upon the theme. This volume is but a  continuation of \"Station Life,\" with this difference: that whereas  that little book dwelt somewhat upon practical matters, these pages  are entirely devoted to reminiscences of the idler hours of a settler's  life.    Many readers have friends and relations out in those beautiful distant  islands, and though her book should possess no wider interest, the  author hopes that these at least will care to know exactly what sort of  life their absent dear ones are leading. One thing is certain: that few  books can ever have afforded so much pleasure to their authors, or can  have appeared more completely to write themselves, than \"Station Life,\"  and this, its sequel.    M. A. B.        Chapter I: A Bush picnic.      Since my return to England, two years ago, I have been frequently asked  by my friends and acquaintances, \"How did you amuse yourself up at the  station?\" I am generally tempted to reply, \"We were all too busy to  need amusement;\" but when I come to think the matter over calmly and  dispassionately, I find that a great many of our occupations may be  classed under the head of play rather than work. But that would hardly  give a fair idea of our lives there, either. It would be more correct to  say perhaps, that most of our simple pleasures were composed of a solid  layer of usefulness underneath the froth of fun and frolic. I purpose  therefore in these sketches to describe some of the pursuits which  afforded us a keen enjoyment at the time,--an enjoyment arising from  perfect health, simple tastes, and an exquisite climate.    It will be as well to begin with the description of one of the picnics,  which were favourite amusements in our home, nestled in a valley of  the Malvern Hills of Canterbury. These hills are of a very respectable  height, and constitute in fact the lowest slopes of the great Southern  Alps, which rise to snow-clad peaks behind them. Our little wooden  homestead stood at the head of a sunny, sheltered valley, and around it  we could see the hills gradually rolling into downs, which in their turn  were smoothed out, some ten or twelve miles off, into the dead level of  the plains. The only drawback to the picturesque beauty of these lower  ranges is the absence of forest, or as it is called there, bush. Behind  the Malvern Hills, where they begin to rise into steeper ascents, lies  many and many a mile of bush-clad mountain, making deep blue shadows  when the setting sun brings the grand Alpine range into sharp white  outline against the background of dazzling Italian sky. But just here,  where my beloved antipodean home stood, we had no trees whatever, except  those which we had planted ourselves, and whose growth we watched with  eager interest. I dwell a little upon this point, to try to convey  to any one who may glance at these pages, how we all,--dwellers among  tree-less hills as we were,--longed and pined for the sights and sounds  of a \"bush.\"    Quite out of view from the house or garden, and about seven miles away,  lay a mountain pass, or saddle, over a range, which was densely wooded,  and from whose highest peak we could see a wide extent of timbered  country. Often in our evening rides we have gone round by that saddle,  in spite of a break-neck track and quicksands and bogs, just to satisfy  our constant longing for green leaves, waving branches, and the twitter  of birds. Whenever any wood was wanted for building a stockyard, or  slabbing a well, or making a post-and-rail fence around a new paddock,  we were obliged to take out a Government license to cut wood in this  splendid bush. Armed with the necessary document the next step was to  engage \"bushmen,\" or woodcutters by profession, who felled and cut the  timber into the proper lengths, and stacked it neatly in a clearing,  where it could get dry and seasoned. These stacks were often placed in  such inaccessible and rocky parts of the steep mountain side, that they  had to be brought down to the flat in rude little sledges, drawn by  a bullock, who required to be trained to the work, and to possess so  steady and equable a disposition as to be indifferent to the annoyance  of great logs of heavy wood dangling and bumping against his heels as  the sledge pursued its uneven way down the bed of a mountain torrent, in  default of a better road.    Imagine, then, a beautiful day in our early New Zealand autumn. For  a week past, a furious north-westerly gale had been blowing down the  gorges of the Rakaia and the Selwyn, as if it had come out of a funnel,  and sweeping across the great shelterless plains with irresistible  force. We had been close prisoners to the house all those days, dreading  to open a door to go out for wood or water, lest a terrific blast should  rush in and whip the light shingle roof off. Not an animal could be seen  out of doors; they had all taken shelter on the lee-side of the gorse  hedges, which are always planted round a garden to give the vegetables  a chance of coming up. On the sky-line of the hills could be perceived  towards evening, mobs of sheep feeding with their heads _up_-wind,  and travelling to the high camping-grounds which they always select in  preference to a valley. The yellow tussocks were bending all one way,  perfectly flat to the ground, and the shingle on the gravel walk outside  rattled like hail against the low latticed windows. The uproar from the  gale was indescribable, and the little fragile house swayed and shook as  the furious gusts hurled themselves against it. Inside its shelter, the  pictures were blowing out from the walls, until I expected them to be  shaken off their hooks even in those rooms which had plank walls lined  with papered canvas; whilst in the kitchen, store-room, etc., whose  sides were made of cob, the dust blew in fine clouds from the pulverized  walls, penetrating even to the dairy, and settling half an inch thick  on my precious cream. At last, when our skin felt like tightly drawn  parchment, and our ears and eyes had long been filled with powdered  earth, the wind dropped at sunset as suddenly as it had risen five days  before. We ventured out to breathe the dust-laden atmosphere, and  to look if the swollen creeks (swollen because snow-fed) had done or  threatened to do any mischief, and saw on the south-west horizon great  fleecy masses of cloud driving rapidly up before a chill icy breeze.  Hurrah, here comes a sou'-wester! The parched-up earth, the shrivelled  leaves, the dusty grass, all needed the blessed damp air. In an hour it  was upon us. We had barely time to house the cows and horses, to feed  the fowls, and secure them in their own shed, and to light a roaring  coal (or rather lignite, for it is not true coal) fire in the  drawing-room, when, with a few warning splashes, the deluge of cold rain  came steadily down, and we went to sleep to the welcome sound of its  refreshing patter.    All that I have been describing was the weather of the past week.  Disagreeable as it might have been, it was needed in both its hot and  cold, dry and wet extremes, to make a true New Zealand day. The furious  nor'-wester had blown every fleck of cloud below the horizon, and dried  the air until it was as light as ether. The \"s'utherly buster,\" on the  other hand, had cooled and refreshed everything in the most delicious  way, and a perfect day had come at last. What words can describe the  pleasure it is to inhale such an atmosphere? One feels as if old age  or sickness or even sorrow, could hardly exist beneath such a spotless  vault of blue as stretched out above our happy heads. I have often  been told that this feeling of intense pleasure on a fine day, which is  peculiar to New Zealand, is really a very low form of animal enjoyment.  It may be so, but I only know that I never stood in the verandah early  in the morning of such a day as I am trying to sketch in pen and ink  now, without feeling the highest spiritual joy, the deepest thankfulness  to the loving Father who had made His beautiful world so fair, and who  would fain lead us through its paths of pleasantness to a still more  glorious, home, which will be free from the shadows brooding from  beneath sin's out-stretched wings over this one. As I stood in the  porch I have often fancied I could seethe animals and even the poultry  expressing in dumb brute fashion, their joy and gratitude to the God  from whom all blessings flow.    But to return to the verandah, although we have never left it. Presently  F---- came out, and I said with a sigh, born of deep content and  happiness, \"What a day!\" \"Yes,\" answered F----: \"a heavenly day indeed:  well worth waiting for. I want to go and see how the men are getting on  in the bush. Will you like to come too?\" \"Of course I will. What can be  more enchanting than the prospect of spending such sunny hours in that  glorious bush?\" So after breakfast I give my few simple orders to the  cook, and prepare, to pack a \"Maori kit,\" or flat basket made of flax,  which could be fastened to my side-saddle, with the preparations for our  luncheon. First some mutton chops had to be trimmed and prepared, all  ready to be cooked when we got there. These were neatly folded up in  clean paper; and a little packet of tea, a few lumps of white sugar,  a tiny wooden contrivance for holding salt and pepper, and a couple of  knives and forks, were added to the parcel.    So much for the contents of the basket. They needed to be carefully  packed so as not to rattle in any way, or Helen, my pretty bay mare,  would soon have got rid of the luncheon--and me. I wrapped up three or  four large raw potatoes in separate bits of paper, and slipped them into  F----'s pockets"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

CHAPTER I    OUR FRIENDLY NERVES      \"Hop up, Dick, love! See how glorious the sun is on the new snow. Now  isn't that more beautiful than your dreams? And see the birdies! They  can't find any breakfast. Let's hurry and have our morning wrestle and  dress and give them some breakie before Anne calls.\"    The mother is Ethel Baxter Lord. She is thirty-eight, and Dick-boy is  just five. The mother's face is striking, striking as an example of  fine chiseling of features, each line standing for sensitiveness, and  each change revealing refinement of thought. The eyes and hair are  richly brown. Slender, graceful, perennially neat, she represents the  mother beautiful, the wife inspiring, the friend beloved. Happily as  we have seen her start a new day for Dick, did she always add some  cheer, some fineness of touch, some joy of word, some stimulating  helpfulness to every greeting, to every occasion.    The home was not pretentious. Thoroughly cozy, with many artistic  touches within, it snuggled on the heights near Arlington, the close  neighbor to many of the Nation's best memories, looking out on a noble  sweep of the fine, old Potomac, with glimpses through the trees of the  Nation's Capitol, glimpses revealing the best of its beauties. It was  a home from which emanated an atmosphere of peace and repose which one  seemed to feel even as one approached. It was a home pervaded with the  breath of happiness, a home which none entered without benefit.    The husband, Martin Lord, was an expert chemist who had long been in  the service of the Government. Capable, worthy, manly, he was blest in  what he was, and in what he had. They had been married eight years,  and the slipping away of the first child, Margaret, was the only  sadness which had paused at their door. Mrs. Lord had been Ethel  Baxter for thirty years. Her father was an intense, high-strung  business man, an importer, who spent much time in Europe where he died  of an American-contracted typhoid-fever, when Ethel was ten. Her  mother was one of a large well-known Maryland family, fair, brown-eyed  too, and frail; also, by all the rights of inheritance, training and  development, sensitive and nervous. In her family the precedents of  blue blood were religiously maintained with so much emphasis on the  \"blue\" that no beginning was ever made in training her into a  protective robustness. So, in spite of elaborate preparation and noted  New York skill and the highest grade of conscientious nursing, she  recovered poorly after Ethel's birth. Strength, even such as she  formerly had, did not return. She didn't want to be an invalid. She  was devoted to her husband and eager to companion and mother her  child. The surgeons thought her recovery lay in their skill, and in  ten years one operated twice, and two others operated once each, but  for some reason the scalpel's edge did not reach the weakness. Then  Mr. Baxter died, and all of her physical discomforts seemed  intensified until, in desperation, the fifth operation was undertaken,  which was long and severe, and from which she failed to react. So  Ethel was an orphan at eleven, though not alone, for the good uncle,  her mother's brother, took her to his home and never failed to respond  to any impulse through which he felt he could fulfil the fatherhood  and motherhood which he had assumed. Absolutely devoted, affectionate,  emotional, he planned impulsively, he gave freely, but he knew not law  nor order in his own high-keyed life; so neither law nor order entered  into the training of his ward.    Ethel Baxter's childhood had been remarkably well influenced,  considering the nervous intensity of both parents. For the mother's  sake, their winters had been spent in Florida, their summers on Long  Island. Her mother, in face of the fact that she rarely knew a day of  physical comfort and for years had not felt the thrill of physical  strength, most conscientiously gave time, thought and prayer to her  child's rearing. Hours were devoted to daily lessons, and many habits  of consideration and refinement, many ideals of beauty, many niceties  of domestic duty and practically all her studies, were mother-taught.  Ethel was active, physically restless, impulsive, cheerful, fairly  intense in her eagerness for an expression of the thrilling activities  within. She was truly a high-type product of generations of fine  living, and her blue blood did show from the first in the rapid  development of keenness of mind and acuteness of feeling. Typically of  the nervous temperament, she early showed a superb capacity for  complex adjustments. Yet, with one damaging, and later threatening  idea, the mother infected the child's mind; the conception of  invalidism entered into the constructive fabric of the child-thought  all the more deeply, because there was little of offensively selfish  invalidism ever displayed by the mother. But many of the concessions  and considerations instinctively demanded by the nervous sufferer were  for years matters-of-course in the Baxter home; and these demands,  almost unconsciously made by the mother, could but modify much of the  natural expression of her child's young years.    Another damaging attitude-reaction, intense in its expression,  followed the unexpected death of Ethel's father. The mother, true to  the ancient and honorable precedents of her family, went into a month  of helplessness following the sad news. She could not attend the  funeral, and for weeks the activities of the household were muffled by  mourning; when she left her room, it was to wear the deepest crepe,  while a half-inch of deadest black bordered the hundreds of responses  which she personally sent to notes of condolence. She never spoke  again of her husband without reference to her bereavement. Then, a  year later, when the mother herself suddenly went, it seemed to  devolve on the child to fulfil the mother's teachings. Her uncle's  attitude, moreover, toward his sister's death was in many ways  unhappy, for he did not repress expressions of bitterness toward the  surgeons and condemned the fate which had so early robbed Ethel of  both parents.    Thus, early and intensely, a morbid attitude toward death, a  conviction that self-pity was reasonable, normal, wholesome, a belief  that it was her duty to publicly display intensive evidences of her  affliction, determined a lasting and potent influence in this girl's  life which was to alloy her young womanhood--disturbing factors, all,  which before twelve caused much emotional disequilibrium. She now  lived with her uncle in New York City and her summers were spent in  Canada. The sense of fitness was so strong that during the next two  vitally important, developing years she avoided any physical  expression of her natural exuberance of spirits; and habits now formed  which were, for years, to deny her any right use of her muscular self.  She read much; she read well; she read intensely. She attended a  private school and long before her time was an accredited young lady.  Mentally, she matured very early, and with the exception of the  damaging influences which have been mentioned, she represented a  superior capacity for feeling and conceiving and accomplishing, even  as she possessed an equally keen capacity for suffering.    She was most winsome at sixteen, a bit frail and fragile, often spoken  of as a rare"]]]
