USES OF GREAT MEN.      It is natural to believe in great men. If the companions of our  childhood should turn out to be heroes, and their condition regal, it  would not surprise us. All mythology opens with demigods, and the  circumstance is high and poetic; that is, their genius is paramount.  In the legends of the Gautama, the first men ate the earth, and found  it deliciously sweet.    Nature seems to exist for the excellent. The world is upheld by the  veracity of good men: they make the earth wholesome. They who lived  with them found life glad and nutritious. Life is sweet and tolerable  only in our belief in such society; and actually, or ideally, we manage  to live with superiors. We call our children and our lands by their  names. Their names are wrought into the verbs of language, their works  and effigies are in our houses, and every circumstance of the day  recalls an anecdote of them.    The search after the great is the dream of youth, and the most serious  occupation of manhood. We travel into foreign parts to find his  works,--if possible, to get a glimpse of him. But we are put off with  fortune instead. You say, the English are practical; the Germans are  hospitable; in Valencia, the climate is delicious; and in the hills  of Sacramento there is gold for the gathering. Yes, but I do not travel  to find comfortable, rich, and hospitable people, or clear sky, or  ingots that cost too much. But if there were any magnet that would  point to the countries and houses where are the persons who are  intrinsically rich and powerful, I would sell all, and buy it, and put  myself on the road to-day.    The race goes with us on their credit. The knowledge, that in the city  is a man who invented the railroad, raises the credit of all the  citizens. But enormous populations, if they be beggars, are disgusting,  like moving cheese, like hills of ants, or of fleas--the more, the  worse.    Our religion is the love and cherishing of these patrons. The gods of  fable are the shining moments of great men. We run all our vessels  into one mould. Our colossal theologies of Judaism, Christism, Buddhism,  Mahometism, are the necessary and structural action of the human mind.  The student of history is like a man going into a warehouse to buy  cloths or carpets. He fancies he has a new article. If he go to the  factory, he shall find that his new stuff still repeats the scrolls  and rosettes which are found on the interior walls of the pyramids of  Thebes. Our theism is the purification of the human mind. Man can  paint, or make, or think nothing but man. He believes that the great  material elements had their origin from his thought. And our philosophy  finds one essence collected or distributed.    If now we proceed to inquire into the kinds of service we derive from  others, let us be warned of the danger of modern studies, and begin  low enough. We must not contend against love, or deny the substantial  existence of other people. I know not what would happen to us. We have  social strengths. Our affection toward others creates a sort of vantage  or purchase which nothing will supply. I can do that by another which  I cannot do alone. I can say to you what I cannot first say to myself.  Other men are lenses through which we read our own minds. Each man  seeks those of different quality from his own, and such as are good  of their kind; that is, he seeks other men, and the otherest. The  stronger the nature, the more it is reactive. Let us have the quality  pure. A little genius let us leave alone. A main difference betwixt  men is, whether they attend their own affair or not. Man is that noble  endogenous plant which grows, like the palm, from within, outward. His  own affair, though impossible to others, he can open with celerity and  in sport. It is easy to sugar to be sweet, and to nitre to be salt.  We take a great deal of pains to waylay and entrap that which of itself  will fall into our hands. I count him a great man who inhabits a higher  sphere of thought, into which other men rise with labor and difficulty;  he has but to open his eyes to see things in a true light, and in large  relations; whilst they must make painful corrections, and keep a  vigilant eye on many sources of error. His service to us is of like  sort. It costs a beautiful person no exertion to paint her image on  our eyes; yet how splendid is that benefit! It costs no more for a  wise soul to convey his quality to other men. And every one can do his  best thing easiest--\"_Peu de moyens, beaucoup d'effet._\" He is great who  is what he is from nature, and who never reminds us of others.    But he must be related to us, and our life receive from him some promise  of explanation. I cannot tell what I would know; but I have observed  there are persons, who, in their character and actions, answer questions  which I have not skill to put. One man answers some questions which  none of his contemporaries put, and is isolated. The past and passing  religions and philosophies answer some other question. Certain men  affect us as rich possibilities, but helpless to themselves and to  their times,--the sport, perhaps, of some instinct that rules in the  air;--they do not speak to our want. But the great are near: we know  them at sight. They satisfy expectation, and fall into place. What is  good is effective, generative; makes for itself room, food, and allies.  A sound apple produces seed,--a hybrid does not. Is a man in his place,  he is constructive, fertile, magnetic, inundating armies with his  purpose, which is thus executed. The river makes its own shores, and  each legitimate idea makes its own channels and welcome,--harvest for  food, institutions for expression, weapons to fight with, and disciples  to explain it. The true artist has the planet for his pedestal; the  adventurer, after years of strife, has nothing broader than his own  shoes.    Our common discourse respects two kinds of use of service from superior  men. Direct giving is agreeable to the early belief of men; direct  giving of material or metaphysical aid, as of health, eternal youth,  fine senses, arts of healing, magical power, and prophecy. The boy  believes there is a teacher who can sell him wisdom. Churches believe  in imputed merit. But, in strictness, we are not much cognizant of  direct serving. Man is endogenous, and education is his unfolding. The  aid we have from others is mechanical, compared with the discoveries  of nature in us. What is thus learned is delightful in the doing, and  the effect remains. Right ethics are central, and go from the soul  outward. Gift is contrary to the law of the universe. Serving others  is serving us. I must absolve me to myself. \"Mind thy affair,\" says  the spirit:--\"coxcomb, would you meddle with the skies, or with other  people?\" Indirect service is left. Men have a pictorial or  representative quality, and serve us in the intellect. Behmen and  Swedenborg saw that things were representative. Men are also  representative; first, of things, and secondly, of ideas.    As plants convert the minerals into food for animals, so each man  converts some raw material in nature to human use. The inventors of  fire, electricity, magnetism, iron; lead, glass, linen, silk, cotton;  the makers of tools; the inventor of decimal notation; the geometer;  the engineer; musician,--severally make an easy way for all, through  unknown and impossible confusions. Each man is, by secret liking,  connected with some district of nature, whose agent and interpreter  he is, as Linnaeus, of plants; Huber, of bees; Fries, of lichens; Van  Mons, of pears; Dalton, of atomic forms; Euclid, of lines; Newton, of  fluxions.    A man is a center for nature, running out threads of relation through  everything, fluid and solid, material and elemental. The earth rolls;  every clod and stone comes to the meridian; so every organ, function,  acid, crystal, grain of dust, has its relation to the brain. It waits  long, but its turn comes. Each plant has its parasite, and each created  thing its lover and poet. Justice has already been done to steam, to  iron, to wood, to coal, to loadstone, to iodine, to corn, and cotton;  but how few materials are yet used by our arts! The mass of creatures  and of qualities are still hid and expectant. It would seem as if each  waited, like the enchanted princess in fairy tales, for a destined  human deliverer. Each must be disenchanted, and walk forth to the day  in human shape. In the history of discovery, the ripe and latent truth  seems to have fashioned a brain for itself. A magnet must be made man,  in some Gilbert, or Swedenborg, or Oersted, before the general mind  can come to entertain its powers.    If we limit ourselves to the first advantages;--a sober grace adheres  to the mineral and botanic kingdoms, which, in the highest moments,  comes up as the charm of nature,--the glitter of the spar, the sureness  of affinity, the veracity of angles. Light and darkness, heat and cold,  hunger and food, sweet and sour, solid, liquid, and gas, circle us  round in a wreath of pleasures, and, by their agreeable quarrel, beguile  the day of life. The eye repeats every day the finest eulogy on  things--\"He saw that they were good.\" We know where to find them; and  these performers are relished all the more, after a little experience  of the pretending races. We are entitled, also, to higher advantages.  Something is wanting to science, until it has been humanized.
