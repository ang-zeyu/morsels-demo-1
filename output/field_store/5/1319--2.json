EPILOGUE          FOREWORD      The spell of the desert comes back to me, as it always will come. I see  the veils, like purple smoke, in the canyon, and I feel the silence. And  it seems that again I must try to pierce both and to get at the strange  wild life of the last American wilderness--wild still, almost, as it  ever was.      While this romance is an independent story, yet readers of \"Riders of  the Purple Sage\" will find in it an answer to a question often asked.    I wish to say also this story has appeared serially in a different  form in one of the monthly magazines under the title of \"The Desert  Crucible.\"             ZANE GREY.                 June, 1915.            THE RAINBOW TRAIL          I. RED LAKE      Shefford halted his tired horse and gazed with slowly realizing eyes.    A league-long slope of sage rolled and billowed down to Red Lake, a dry  red basin, denuded and glistening, a hollow in the desert, a lonely and  desolate door to the vast, wild, and broken upland beyond.    All day Shefford had plodded onward with the clear horizon-line a thing  unattainable; and for days before that he had ridden the wild bare flats  and climbed the rocky desert benches. The great colored reaches and  steps had led endlessly onward and upward through dim and deceiving  distance.    A hundred miles of desert travel, with its mistakes and lessons and  intimations, had not prepared him for what he now saw. He beheld what  seemed a world that knew only magnitude. Wonder and awe fixed his gaze,  and thought remained aloof. Then that dark and unknown northland flung  a menace at him. An irresistible call had drawn him to this seamed and  peaked border of Arizona, this broken battlemented wilderness of Utah  upland; and at first sight they frowned upon him, as if to warn him not  to search for what lay hidden beyond the ranges. But Shefford thrilled  with both fear and exultation. That was the country which had been  described to him. Far across the red valley, far beyond the ragged line  of black mesa and yellow range, lay the wild canyon with its haunting  secret.    Red Lake must be his Rubicon. Either he must enter the unknown to seek,  to strive, to find, or turn back and fail and never know and be always  haunted. A friend's strange story had prompted his singular journey; a  beautiful rainbow with its mystery and promise had decided him. Once in  his life he had answered a wild call to the kingdom of adventure  within him, and once in his life he had been happy. But here in the  horizon-wide face of that up-flung and cloven desert he grew cold; he  faltered even while he felt more fatally drawn.    As if impelled Shefford started his horse down the sandy trail, but he  checked his former far-reaching gaze. It was the month of April, and the  waning sun lost heat and brightness. Long shadows crept down the slope  ahead of him and the scant sage deepened its gray. He watched the  lizards shoot like brown streaks across the sand, leaving their slender  tracks; he heard the rustle of pack-rats as they darted into their  brushy homes; the whir of a low-sailing hawk startled his horse.    Like ocean waves the slope rose and fell, its hollows choked with sand,  its ridge-tops showing scantier growth of sage and grass and weed. The  last ridge was a sand-dune, beautifully ribbed and scalloped and lined  by the wind, and from its knife-sharp crest a thin wavering sheet of  sand blew, almost like smoke. Shefford wondered why the sand looked red  at a distance, for here it seemed almost white. It rippled everywhere,  clean and glistening, always leading down.    Suddenly Shefford became aware of a house looming out of the bareness  of the slope. It dominated that long white incline. Grim, lonely,  forbidding, how strangely it harmonized with the surroundings! The  structure was octagon-shaped, built of uncut stone, and resembled a  fort. There was no door on the sides exposed to Shefford's gaze, but  small apertures two-thirds the way up probably served as windows and  port-holes. The roof appeared to be made of poles covered with red  earth.    Like a huge cold rock on a wide plain this house stood there on the  windy slope. It was an outpost of the trader Presbrey, of whom Shefford  had heard at Flagstaff and Tuba. No living thing appeared in the  limit of Shefford's vision. He gazed shudderingly at the unwelcoming  habitation, at the dark eyelike windows, at the sweep of barren slope  merging into the vast red valley, at the bold, bleak bluffs. Could any  one live here? The nature of that sinister valley forbade a home there,  and the spirit of the place hovered in the silence and space. Shefford  thought irresistibly of how his enemies would have consigned him to  just such a hell. He thought bitterly and mockingly of the narrow  congregation that had proved him a failure in the ministry, that had  repudiated his ideas of religion and immortality and God, that had  driven him, at the age of twenty-four, from the calling forced upon him  by his people. As a boy he had yearned to make himself an artist; his  family had made him a clergyman; fate had made him a failure. A failure  only so far in his life, something urged him to add--for in the lonely  days and silent nights of the desert he had experienced a strange birth  of hope. Adventure had called him, but it was a vague and spiritual  hope, a dream of promise, a nameless attainment that fortified his  wilder impulse.    As he rode around a corner of the stone house his horse snorted and  stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost displacing  a red long-haired blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick thuds  of hoofs in sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled  poles, and here he saw another pony.    Shefford heard subdued voices. He dismounted and walked to an open door.  In the dark interior he dimly descried a high counter, a stairway, a  pile of bags of flour, blankets, and silver-ornamented objects, but the  persons he had heard were not in that part of the house. Around another  corner of the octagon-shaped wall he found another open door, and  through it saw goat-skins and a mound of dirty sheep-wool, black and  brown and white. It was light in this part of the building. When he  crossed the threshold he was astounded to see a man struggling with  a girl--an Indian girl. She was straining back from him, panting, and  uttering low guttural sounds. The man's face was corded and dark with  passion. This scene affected Shefford strangely. Primitive emotions were  new to him.    Before Shefford could speak the girl broke loose and turned to flee. She  was an Indian and this place was the uncivilized desert, but Shefford  knew terror when he saw it. Like a dog the man rushed after her. It was  instinct that made Shefford strike, and his blow laid the man flat. He  lay stunned a moment, then raised himself to a sitting posture, his  hand to his face, and the gaze he fixed upon Shefford seemed to combine  astonishment and rage.    \"I hope you're not Presbrey,\" said Shefford, slowly. He felt awkward,  not sure of himself.    The man appeared about to burst into speech, but repressed it. There  was blood on his mouth and his hand. Hastily he scrambled to his feet.  Shefford saw this man's amaze and rage change to shame. He was tall and  rather stout; he had a smooth tanned face, soft of outline, with a weak  chin; his eyes were dark. The look of him and his corduroys and his soft  shoes gave Shefford an impression that he was not a man who worked hard.  By contrast with the few other worn and rugged desert men Shefford had  met this stranger stood out strikingly. He stooped to pick up a soft  felt hat and, jamming it on his head, he hurried out. Shefford followed  him and watched him from the door. He went directly to the corral,  mounted the pony, and rode out, to turn down the slope toward the south.  When he reached the level of the basin, where evidently the sand was  hard, he put the pony to a lope and gradually drew away.    \"Well!\" ejaculated Shefford. He did not know what to make of this  adventure. Presently he became aware that the Indian girl was sitting on  a roll of blankets near the wall. With curious interest Shefford studied  her appearance. She had long, raven-black hair, tangled and disheveled,  and she wore a soiled white band of cord above her brow. The color of  her face struck him; it was dark, but not red nor bronzed; it almost  had a tinge of gold. Her profile was clear-cut, bold, almost stern. Long  black eyelashes hid her eyes. She wore a tight-fitting waist garment of  material resembling velveteen. It was ripped along her side, exposing  a skin still more richly gold than that of her face. A string of silver  ornaments and turquoise-and-white beads encircled her neck, and it moved  gently up and down with the heaving of her full bosom."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],[0,"Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#1)"],[1,"GODUNOV    A Drama in Verse    By Alexander Pushkin      Rendered into English verse by Alfred Hayes          DRAMATIS PERSONAE*      BORIS GODUNOV, afterwards Tsar.

PALACE OF THE KREMLIN    (FEBRUARY 20th, A.D. 1598)    PRINCE SHUISKY and VOROTINSKY       VOROTINSKY. To keep the city's peace, that is the task     Entrusted to us twain, but you forsooth     Have little need to watch; Moscow is empty;     The people to the Monastery have flocked     After the patriarch. What thinkest thou?     How will this trouble end?       SHUISKY.                 How will it end?     That is not hard to tell. A little more     The multitude will groan and wail, Boris     Pucker awhile his forehead, like a toper     Eyeing a glass of wine, and in the end     Will humbly of his graciousness consent     To take the crown; and then--and then will rule us     Just as before.       VOROTINSKY.   A month has flown already     Since, cloistered with his sister, he forsook     The world's affairs. None hitherto hath shaken     His purpose, not the patriarch, not the boyars     His counselors; their tears, their prayers he heeds not;     Deaf is he to the wail of Moscow, deaf     To the Great Council's voice; vainly they urged     The sorrowful nun-queen to consecrate     Boris to sovereignty; firm was his sister,     Inexorable as he; methinks Boris     Inspired her with this spirit. What if our ruler     Be sick in very deed of cares of state     And hath no strength to mount the throne? What     Say'st thou?       SHUISKY. I say that in that case the blood in vain     Flowed of the young tsarevich, that Dimitry     Might just as well be living.       VOROTINSKY.                 Fearful crime!     Is it beyond all doubt Boris contrived     The young boy's murder?       SHUISKY.              Who besides? Who else     Bribed Chepchugov in vain? Who sent in secret     The brothers Bityagovsky with Kachalov?     Myself was sent to Uglich, there to probe     This matter on the spot; fresh traces there     I found; the whole town bore witness to the crime;     With one accord the burghers all affirmed it;     And with a single word, when I returned,     I could have proved the secret villain's guilt.       VOROTINSKY. Why didst thou then not crush him?       SHUISKY.                        At the time,     I do confess, his unexpected calmness,     His shamelessness, dismayed me. Honestly     He looked me in the eyes; he questioned me     Closely, and I repeated to his face     The foolish tale himself had whispered to me.       VOROTINSKY. An ugly business, prince.       SHUISKY.                    What could I do?     Declare all to Feodor? But the tsar     Saw all things with the eyes of Godunov.     Heard all things with the ears of Godunov;     Grant even that I might have fully proved it,     Boris would have denied it there and then,     And I should have been haled away to prison,     And in good time--like mine own uncle--strangled     Within the silence of some deaf-walled dungeon.     I boast not when I say that, given occasion,     No penalty affrights me. I am no coward,     But also am no fool, and do not choose     Of my free will to walk into a halter.       VOROTINSKY. Monstrous misdeed! Listen; I warrant you     Remorse already gnaws the murderer;     Be sure the blood of that same innocent child     Will hinder him from mounting to the throne.       SHUISKY. That will not baulk him; Boris is not so timid!     What honour for ourselves, ay, for all Russia!     A slave of yesterday, a Tartar, son     By marriage of Maliuta, of a hangman,     Himself in soul a hangman, he to wear     The crown and robe of Monomakh!--       VOROTINSKY.                   You are right;     He is of lowly birth; we twain can boast     A nobler lineage.       SHUISKY.        Indeed we may!       VOROTINSKY. Let us remember, Shuisky, Vorotinsky     Are, let me say, born princes.       SHUISKY.                     Yea, born princes,     And of the blood of Rurik.       VOROTINSKY.              Listen, prince;     Then we, 'twould seem, should have the right to mount     Feodor's throne.       SHUISKY.       Rather than Godunov.       VOROTINSKY. In very truth 'twould seem so.       SHUISKY.                      And what then?     If still Boris pursue his crafty ways,     Let us contrive by skilful means to rouse     The people. Let them turn from Godunov;     Princes they have in plenty of their own;     Let them from out their number choose a tsar.       VOROTINSKY. Of us, Varyags in blood, there are full many,     But 'tis no easy thing for us to vie     With Godunov; the people are not wont     To recognise in us an ancient branch     Of their old warlike masters; long already     Have we our appanages forfeited,     Long served but as lieutenants of the tsars,     And he hath known, by fear, and love, and glory,     How to bewitch the people.       SHUISKY. (Looking through a window.) He has dared,     That's all--while we--Enough of this. Thou seest     Dispersedly the people are returning.     We'll go forthwith and learn what is resolved.          THE RED SQUARE    THE PEOPLE       1ST PERSON. He is inexorable! He thrust from him     Prelates, boyars, and Patriarch; in vain     Prostrate they fall; the splendour of the throne     Affrights him.       2ND PERSON.  O, my God, who is to rule us?     O, woe to us!       3RD PERSON. See! The Chief Minister     Is coming out to tell us what the Council     Has now resolved.       THE PEOPLE.     Silence! Silence! He speaks,     The Minister of State. Hush, hush! Give ear!       SHCHELKALOV. (From the Red Balcony.)     The Council have resolved for the last time     To put to proof the power of supplication     Upon our ruler's mournful soul. At dawn,     After a solemn service in the Kremlin,     The blessed Patriarch will go, preceded     By sacred banners, with the holy ikons     Of Donsky and Vladimir; with him go     The Council, courtiers, delegates, boyars,     And all the orthodox folk of Moscow; all     Will go to pray once more the queen to pity     Fatherless Moscow, and to consecrate     Boris unto the crown. Now to your homes     Go ye in peace: pray; and to Heaven shall rise     The heart's petition of the orthodox.       (The PEOPLE disperse.)          THE VIRGIN'S FIELD    THE NEW NUNNERY. The People.       1ST PERSON. To plead with the tsaritsa in her cell     Now are they gone. Thither have gone Boris,     The Patriarch, and a host of boyars.       2ND PERSON.                        What news?       3RD PERSON. Still is he obdurate; yet there is hope.       PEASANT WOMAN. (With a child.)     Drat you! Stop crying, or else the bogie-man     Will carry you off. Drat you, drat you! Stop crying!       1ST PERSON. Can't we slip through behind the fence?       2ND PERSON.                         Impossible!     No chance at all! Not only is the nunnery     Crowded; the precincts too are crammed with people.     Look what a sight! All Moscow has thronged here.     See! Fences, roofs, and every single storey     Of the Cathedral bell tower, the church-domes,     The very crosses are studded thick with people.       1ST PERSON. A goodly sight indeed!       2ND PERSON.                     What is that noise?       3RD PERSON. Listen! What noise is that?--The people groaned;     See there! They fall like waves, row upon row--     Again--again--Now, brother, 'tis our turn;     Be quick, down on your knees!       THE PEOPLE. (On their knees, groaning and wailing.)                                       Have pity on us,     Our father! O, rule over us! O, be     Father to us, and tsar!       1ST PERSON. (Sotto voce.) Why are they wailing?       2ND PERSON. How can we know? The boyars know well enough.     It's not our business.       PEASANT WOMAN. (With child.)                          Now, what's this? Just when     It ought to cry, the child stops crying. I'll show you!     Here comes the bogie-man! Cry, cry, you spoilt one!     (Throws it on the ground; the child screams.)     That's right, that's right!       1ST PERSON.               As everyone is crying,     We also, brother, will begin to cry.       2ND PERSON. Brother, I try my best, but can't.       1ST PERSON.                             Nor I.     Have you not got an onion?       2ND PERSON.              No; I'll wet     My eyes with spittle. What's up there now?       1ST PERSON.                      Who knows     What's going on?"]]]
