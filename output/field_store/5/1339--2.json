From the source to the engulfing sands was barely a  mile, and the twinkling waters, if full and fierce in winter, showed a  summer fear of their own broad stepping-stones. Nevertheless the sharp  declivities, the juttings of rock, even the shelves and crags and walls  of Dark Head, had been formed by the gnawing of this tiny but persistent  flow.    The valley ran east and west.  The sun, rising beyond St. Cadic Mill,  poured its noon warmth over Hember and sank behind the sheltered plateau  on which stood the old home of the Rosevears.  The dying beams, however,  could not reach the deep-set windows of Wastralls, for the crest of Dark  Head reared itself between the farmstead and the harsh threat of the  Atlantic.  The house lay in a fold of land, hidden equally from those  who moved upon the face of the waters, and those who might be said,  though their habitations were at a distance, to neighbour it.  As a  refuge in troublous times, the position had its value, and there were  indications that this shelf of rock had been, many centuries ago, the  nest of some wild brood.    Upon their heels had followed as descendants or conquerors--the script  is too nearly obliterated to be read--men who in their own strong person  represented the law.  The gate-posts of Wastralls were crowned with the  egg-shaped stones which indicated that it was a manor-house, and that  its owner had the right to dispense justice.  Within the house, and  occupying a space from wall to wall, was the ancient Justice Room; but  its stately uses had long been abated, its irrevocable decisions had  lost their force, in the autumn of its days it had become a lumber-room  and more lately a bedchamber.    A century ago, from the mill at the head of the valley to the Wreckers'  Hut on the foreshore, Trevorrick had been the property of one man.  Of  peasant stock, how Freathy Rosevear came by land and money was matter of  surmise.  'He had gone out one morning a poor man, and had come home  rich.'  Little need, however, to invent tales of hidden treasure,  witchcraft, divination, when the caves in Morwen Cove made so safe a  store-house: when the Wreckers' Hut stood behind the teeth of the Mad  Rip: when the lanes that converged upon the towns--the towns in which  queer commodities could always be sold--were so deep and secret.  Whatever the sources of his income, as fortunes went, in that remote  district, Freathy Rosevear was accounted wealthy.  He was also a man to  take the eye.  Big, florid, fair, he might have stepped out of a Holbein  canvas, and tales of his unusual strength were told and retold of a  winter's evening in the cottages.  Did his wife complain the store of  wreck was running low?  Forthwith he had gone out, caught the first of  the homing donkeys, and carried it, load and all, into her presence,  with \"A fardel for my Lady\"--so the story.    The man was as Saul to a kingless folk, a head and shoulders above the  multitude.  Like the last of the Tudor monarchs he brought the people  among whom he lived material well-being, and, like other outstanding  personalities, stamped his impress on the current coin. Before he died  he was \"Old Squire\" and, as such, he lived in the long memory of the  countryside.  Not that to them his death was the final exit from the  stage of his influence and activities.  Though they followed him to his  burying, though they saw the sods falling earth to earth, they could not  believe that abundant, penetrating, imperial vitality could be resolved  into its elements. Recognizing that neither heaven nor hell was the  fitting place for it, they showed their faith in the life after death by  a hardy belief that Old Squire, though rendered invisible, was still  among them.    When this man's grip upon Trevorrick relaxed, the land fell to his three  legitimate sons: for his other children, and he had done his part in  peopling the neighbourhood, he had provided during his life.  The  legitimate sons, Freathy, Constantine, and Tom, were good farmers all,  but cast in an ordinary mould.  They lived, they replenished the earth  and, in the fullness of time, went back to it, dust to dust.  A younger  Constantine now owned the mill, a younger Tom tilled the fat slopes of  Hember, and Wastralls, the cradle of the race, was become the property  of Freathy's only child, his daughter Sabina.  Every rood of land in the  valley was still Rosevear property, and the cousins, shut in by their  hill boundaries, formed a community conscious at once of its kinship and  its isolation.    Of the three farms, Wastralls was the largest and most important.  Across the valley were wide commons--the wastralls--once bare, blown  sand, but now converted by spire grass into turf for the fattening of  red-brown bullocks.  On the heavy land between the house and the little  stream were orchards and cornfields, while behind the cliffs, tethered  in pairs to prevent them being blown over the edge, a flock of sheep  nibbled the short grass.  The manor itself was a low two-storied oblong  of country stone and, with its courts and outhouses, seemed as much an  excrescence of the rocky ground as more solid outcroppings.  A grey  irregularity by day, it sank, when twilight fell, into its surroundings.  At dawn St. Cadic Mill was a black tower against the saffron; at dusk  Hember windows flamed with reflections of the west; but both at dawn and  dusk Wastralls was more a presumption than a fact.  The house was older  than Hember, older than the mill, and its obscurity suggested that the  forgotten builder had hoped the Storm-god might take Wastralls in his  stride, that Death might fail, among so many grey swells and hummocks,  to distinguish it.    The place had been built to house two families.  A dividing wall cut the  fine chambers on the western front from the low-pitched rooms that  looked across the yard. A green door, stout and with a heavy lock, was  set in the dividing wall to allow of communication between the old-time  lord of the manor and the bailiff who tilled his fields; but the  families, living back to back, having different modes of egress and  ingress, the one taking the field path, the other the road, preserved  each its privacy. When Old Squire brought a wife to Wastralls, she,  preferring the homeliness of the farmstead, had made it their  dwelling-place.  From thenceforward the life of the house centred in the  roomy, whitewashed kitchen; and the fine chambers, swept and shuttered,  were only used on ceremonial occasions.  Old Squire had no use for state  or trappings and when his son Freathy reigned in his stead, the lesser  man asked no greater luxury than had satisfied his sire.    This second Freathy married a woman so indistinct that it was a wonder  he had seen her sufficiently well to fall in love.  She ruled Wastralls  with a boneless hand, and used her knees for praying rather than  scrubbing. Of this vague, colourless creature was born the vital  bright-haired Sabina.  Her father welcomed her as a beginning, \"first a  maid and then a child,\" but his wife's effort left her exhausted.  The  tonic air of the valley made it difficult for her to die, but she failed  a little, month by month, until, unnoticed, she was able to slip into  her grave.  Freathy's thought was \"must marry again, try to get a boy;  'twon't do to let a maid be heir of the land.\"  But he was comfortable  as a widower, more comfortable than he had been during Dusha's pious,  slatternly existence and, Time, the inexorable, drew the daisy quilt  about his neck, while he yet procrastinated.    For lack of a son Freathy had taken his daughter with him about the  farm.  His thoughts being of the cattle-market, of soils and crops, it  was of such matters that he spoke; and Sabina picked up the lore of the  seasons as naturally as another child learns to sew and cook.  Her  father was a man who drank, not continuously, but at intervals which,  like a perspective of posts, showed diminishing interspaces.  The child  accepted his habits as she accepted rain and shine and, when he was  under the influence of liquor, did her young best to grapple with his  duties.  By the time he died--from the effects of a night spent  inadvertently in the open--she had gathered a little store of  experience, had indeed been farming Wastralls for over a year.  Freathy,  intending to remarry and leave hearty sons, had not troubled to make a  will and the girl of one-and-twenty succeeded to an unencumbered  freehold of five hundred acres, the manor-house and what remained of Old  Squire's savings.    Offers of help came from both Hember and St. Cadic. Each was willing to  work Wastralls with his own land, each hoped Sabina might listen to a  cousinly tale of love.  She, however, having inherited the robust  confidence of her grandfather, was determined to undertake on her own  account the adventure of farming.  Nor were Tom and Constantine Rosevear  altogether surprised. They had not played with her as children without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive)              STAR OF INDIA          _BY THE SAME AUTHOR_    Into Temptation  Late in Life  The Spell of the Jungle  East of Suez  Red Records  The Stronger Claim  The Waters of Destruction  Idolatry  The Charm  The Anglo-Indians  The Happy Hunting Ground  The Woman in the Bazaar  Separation  Tales that are Told          STAR OF INDIA      BY  ALICE PERRIN    [Illustration: Decoration]      CASSELL AND COMPANY, LTD  London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne      First published 1919      DEDICATED TO MY COUSIN,    BEATRICE MARY BYNG HOLDEN          STAR OF INDIA          PART I          CHAPTER I         I dare not choose my lot;         I would not if I might.       Choose thou for me, my God,         So shall I walk aright.      The rustic portion of the congregation shouted the familiar hymn with  laborious goodwill, overpowering the more cultivated voices that rose  from the chancel and the front pews--almost defeating the harsh notes  wrung from the harmonium by the village schoolmistress, who also led the  singing in a piercing key, supported raucously by her pupils gathered  about the unmusical instrument. Even in the early 'nineties nothing so  ambitious as an organ or a surpliced choir had as yet been attempted in  this remote west-country parish, though with the advent of the new vicar  innovations had begun; actually, of late, the high oak pews had been  removed to make way for shining pitch-pine seats that in the little  Norman church produced much the same effect as a garish oleograph set in  an antique frame. Most of the parishioners approved the change;  certainly it had the advantage of permitting everyone to observe at  leisure who came to church, what they wore, and how they behaved during  the sermon, even if those who were somnolently inclined found the  publicity disconcerting.    Stella Carrington, for one, infinitely preferred the new seats. Though  no longer a child--seventeen last birthday--she could never quite forget  the hours of misery she had endured in the old pew; the smell of dust  and hassocks, the feeling of captivity, the desperate impulse that would  assail her to kick open the door, to fling a prayer-book over the  barrier, to jump up on the seat; only the fear of grandmamma's wrath had  restrained her from such antics. This Sunday, as she stood between Aunt  Augusta and Aunt Ellen, singing the hymn that preceded the sermon,  recollections returned to her of her childhood's trials in the high pew,  and with these, unaccountably, came the old sense of imprisonment. The  feeling disturbed her; she searched her mind for the cause, and became  conscious that it was somehow connected with the presence of Maud  Verrall, seated with her parents in the religious preserve of the Squire  and his family in the chancel. The Verralls had been absent from The  Court for a considerable period, and now here was Maud, who when Stella  last saw her had been in short petticoats with her hair down her back,  transformed into a young lady; she had a curled fringe, bangles and  puffed sleeves; her dress touched the ground, she had a waist, and her  hat, of a fashionable sailor shape, was set well to the back of her  head. And all this though she was no older than her former playmate,  Stella Carrington, whose skirts even now barely reached her ankles,  whose hair still hung in a plait, whose hat, in her own opinion, was  more suited to a child in a perambulator than to a girl of seventeen. No  wonder she felt stifled, cramped! She realised why the memory of her  tortures in the old box-like pew had recurred to her mind; and then  suddenly the hymn that she knew so well and had sung on such countless  Sundays, paying no special heed to the words, struck her as the acme of  hypocrisy. She ceased singing, amazed that the recognition had not come  to her sooner. Surely whoever was responsible for the wording of this  hymn could never have known the tedium for a young person of living with  a stony-hearted grandmother and two maiden aunts in a small village  where nothing ever happened; the author must have belonged to people  like the Verralls, who were, of course, satisfied with their \"lot,\" and  did not want to change it; people who could \"dare\" do anything they  pleased. If she, Stella Carrington, could choose her lot at this moment,  she would change places with Maud Verrall; and she wondered how Maud  would feel if she found herself forced to accept the lot of Stella  Carrington! Would Maud still humbly proclaim that she would not change  it even if she might?...    Only when Aunt Augusta, regarding her severely, touched her arm did  Stella discover that the hymn was ended; that the congregation was  settling down for the sermon. She sank to her seat, blushing, abashed.    Summer had set in early that year, and the sun poured through the  stained glass window subscribed for by the parish to a former Squire  Verrall, casting kaleidoscopic patterns of purple and crimson on to  grandmamma's brown silk bonnet; a premature bumble-bee droned and bumped  up and down the panes, the atmosphere felt airless, and Aunt Ellen  sniffed elegantly at her green salts-bottle. Stella grew drowsy; she  could not attend to the sermon, and her thoughts strayed on in  confusion.... Would Canon Grass, the vicar, dare to change his lot if he  might? Perhaps he would like to change Mrs. Grass, who was older than  himself, for the pretty visitor who was one of The Court party in the  chancel pew.... And how about Mrs. Daw, who was so artistic, and  considered her talents wasted in her position as wife to a country  doctor; who complained that no one in the village really understood or  appreciated \"Art\".... How much happier Mrs. Daw would be in London had  she the opportunity of changing her lot--of converting her husband into  a West End physician. And as to the villagers; everyone knew that they  were never contented, no matter what was done for them. At this point in  her reflections Stella fell asleep.    The service over, she followed grandmamma and the aunts slowly down the  aisle, while the school children clattered through the porch. The Court  party left the building by the chancel door, and Stella saw them pace  down the slope of the churchyard between the tombstones and the yew  trees to where a carriage and pair of horses awaited them at the gates.  Squire Verrall went first, in a black coat and a square hat like a box,  his whiskers were brushed smartly aside from his ruddy cheeks, his large  nose shone in the sun, he waved his malacca cane to the school children  marshalled on either side of the pathway; Mrs. Verrall followed,  delicate, smiling, sweet, in dark green satin, and a white ostrich  feather floating from a boat-shaped hat; with her came the pretty  visitor, who walked with a Grecian bend ... and Maud. Stella observed  that Maud was \"showing off\"; that she minced and looked down her nose as  she passed between the rows of bobbing, saluting children and villagers.  Stella was filled with an envious contempt for such conceit; such airs  and graces! Three maid-servants completed the procession; even they  would drive back to The Court, on the rumble of the big carriage, while  Stella Carrington would walk through the lanes to The Chestnuts pulling  her grandmother's chair, Aunt Augusta pushing behind, Aunt Ellen  shielding the old lady with a green-lined umbrella. They would wait on  themselves at luncheon; probably there would be boiled mutton and a milk  pudding....    There was: in her present rebellious mood, the sight of the plain,  wholesome food was to Stella as the proverbial last straw. Aunt Augusta  carved the mutton; a watery red stream issued from the joint, mingling  with the caper sauce that surrounded it.    \"None for me, thank you,\" said Stella, with suppressed fury.    \"My dear, why not?\" It was grandmamma who made the inquiry, and Stella  thought the old lady looked like a sea-gull, seated at the end of the  table in her close white cap, her snowy hair looped on either side of  her curved nose.    \"I hate boiled mutton!\" Beneath her rising defiance the girl was  conscious of amazement at her own temerity. She pushed back her chair  and stood up, quivering--a slim young beauty, giving promise of fine  development, though neither beauty nor promise had as yet been  recognised by herself or by her guardians.    \"Yes, I do hate it!\" she cried, and her eyes, the colour of burnt  sienna, filled with rebellious tears, \"and I hate milk puddings and  babyish clothes, and getting up in the morning and going to bed at night  with nothing in between--the same every day. How you could all stand up  and sing that hymn, '_I dare not choose my lot_,'\" she mocked, \"'_I  would not if I might_,' as if you meant it! Why, for most of us, it was  simply a lie!\"    For a space there was a shocked silence. Augusta, the carving knife  poised in her hand, looked at her mother; Ellen stared at her plate and  extracted her salts-bottle with stealth from her pocket; Stella found  her own gaze drawn helplessly to the expressionless old countenance at  the end of the table, and, despite her new-born courage, she quailed.    \"My dear,\" said grandmamma smoothly, \"you had better go and lie down.  The weather has upset you. I think you require a powder.\"    Stella burst into something between laughter and tears; she made a  childish dash for the door and ran noisily up the stairs.    The meal in the dining-room continued as though nothing had happened.  It was not a Carrington custom to discuss unpleasant occurrences at  meals, or, indeed, at any other time, if such discussions could possibly  be avoided; the Carrington elders possessed a fine faculty for ignoring  difficult subjects. It was a gift that had carried them apparently  unscathed through various trials. When it became"]]]
