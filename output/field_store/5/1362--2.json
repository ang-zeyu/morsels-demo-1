They were to  be met with every day, round every street corner, these harridans, more  terrible far than were the men.    This one was still comparatively young, thirty at most; would have been  good-looking too, for the features were really delicate, the nose  chiselled, the brow straight, the chin round and small. But the mouth!  Heavens, what a mouth! Hard and cruel and thin-lipped; and those eyes!  sunken and rimmed with purple; eyes that told tales of sorrow and, yes!  of degradation. The crowd stood round her, sullen and apathetic; poor,  miserable wretches like herself, staring at her antics with lack-lustre  eyes and an ever-recurrent contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.    The woman was dancing, contorting her body in the small circle of light  formed by a flickering lanthorn which was hung across the street from  house to house, striking the muddy pavement with her shoeless feet, all  to the sound of a be-ribboned tambourine which she struck now and again  with her small, grimy hand. From time to time she paused, held out the  tambourine at arm's length, and went the round of the spectators, asking  for alms. But at her approach the crowd at once seemed to disintegrate,  to melt into the humid evening air; it was but rarely that a greasy  token fell into the outstretched tambourine. Then as the woman started  again to dance the crowd gradually reassembled, and stood, hands in  pockets, lips still sullen and contemptuous, but eyes watchful of the  spectacle. There were such few spectacles these days, other than the  monotonous processions of tumbrils with their load of aristocrats for  the guillotine!    So the crowd watched, and the woman danced. The lanthorn overhead threw  a weird light on red caps and tricolour cockades, on the sullen faces of  the men and the shoulders of the women, on the dancer's weird antics and  her flying, tattered skirts. She was obviously tired, as a poor,  performing cur might be, or a bear prodded along to uncongenial  buffoonery. Every time that she paused and solicited alms with her  tambourine the crowd dispersed, and some of them laughed because she  insisted.    \"Voyons,\" she said with a weird attempt at gaiety, \"a couple of sous for  the entertainment, citizen! You have stood here half an hour. You can't  have it all for nothing, what?\"    The man--young, square-shouldered, thick-lipped, with the look of a  bully about his well-clad person--retorted with a coarse insult, which  the woman resented. There were high words; the crowd for the most part  ranged itself on the side of the bully. The woman backed against the  wall nearest to her, held feeble, emaciated hands up to her ears in a  vain endeavour to shut out the hideous jeers and ribald jokes which were  the natural weapons of this untamed crowd.    Soon blows began to rain; not a few fell upon the unfortunate woman. She  screamed, and the more she screamed the louder did the crowd jeer, the  uglier became its temper. Then suddenly it was all over. How it happened  the woman could not tell. She had closed her eyes, feeling sick and  dizzy; but she had heard a loud call, words spoken in English (a  language which she understood), a pleasant laugh, and a brief but  violent scuffle. After that the hurrying retreat of many feet, the click  of sabots on the uneven pavement and patter of shoeless feet, and then  silence.    She had fallen on her knees and was cowering against the wall, had lost  consciousness probably for a minute or two. Then she heard that pleasant  laugh again and the soft drawl of the English tongue.    \"I love to see those beggars scuttling off, like so many rats to their  burrows, don't you, Ffoulkes?\"    \"They didn't put up much fight, the cowards!\" came from another voice,  also in English. \"A dozen of them against this wretched woman. What had  best be done with her?\"    \"I'll see to her,\" rejoined the first speaker. \"You and Tony had best  find the others. Tell them I shall be round directly.\"    It all seemed like a dream. The woman dared not open her eyes lest  reality--hideous and brutal--once more confronted her. Then all at once  she felt that her poor, weak body, encircled by strong arms, was lifted  off the ground, and that she was being carried down the street, away  from the light projected by the lanthorn overhead, into the sheltering  darkness of a yawning porte cochere. But she was not then fully  conscious.      II    When she reopened her eyes she was in what appeared to be the lodge of a  concierge. She was lying on a horsehair sofa. There was a sense of  warmth and of security around her. No wonder that it still seemed like a  dream. Before her stood a man, tall and straight, surely a being from  another world--or so he appeared to the poor wretch who, since  uncountable time, had set eyes on none but the most miserable dregs of  struggling humanity, who had seen little else but rags, and faces either  cruel or wretched. This man was clad in a huge caped coat, which made  his powerful figure seem preternaturally large. His hair was fair and  slightly curly above his low, square brow; the eyes beneath their heavy  lids looked down on her with unmistakable kindness.    The poor woman struggled to her feet. With a quick and pathetically  humble gesture she drew her ragged, muddy skirts over her ankles and her  tattered kerchief across her breast.    \"I had best go now, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she murmured, while a hot  flush rose to the roots of her unkempt hair. \"I must not stop here....  I--\"    \"You are not going, Madame,\" he broke in, speaking now in perfect French  and with a great air of authority, as one who is accustomed to being  implicitly obeyed, \"until you have told me how, a lady of culture and of  refinement, comes to be masquerading as a street-dancer. The game is a  dangerous one, as you have experienced to-night.\"    \"It is no game, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she stammered; \"nor yet a  masquerade. I have been a street-dancer all my life, and--\"    By way of an answer he took her hand, always with that air of authority  which she never thought to resent.    \"This is not a street-dancer's hand; Madame,\" he said quietly. \"Nor is  your speech that of the people.\"    She drew her hand away quickly, and the flush on her haggard face  deepened.    \"If you will honour me with your confidence, Madame,\" he insisted.    The kindly words, the courtesy of the man, went to the poor creature's  heart. She fell back upon the sofa and with her face buried in her arms  she sobbed out her heart for a minute or two. The man waited quite  patiently. He had seen many women weep these days, and had dried many a  tear through deeds of valour and of self-sacrifice, which were for ever  recorded in the hearts of those whom he had succoured.    When this poor woman had succeeded in recovering some semblance of  self-control, she turned her wan, tear-stained face to him and said  simply:    \"My name is Madeleine Lannoy, Monsieur. My husband was killed during the  emeutes at Versailles, whilst defending the persons of the Queen and of  the royal children against the fury of the mob. When I was a girl I had  the misfortune to attract the attentions of a young doctor named Jean  Paul Marat. You have heard of him, Monsieur?\"    The other nodded.    \"You know him, perhaps,\" she continued, \"for what he is: the most cruel  and revengeful of men. A few years ago he threw up his lucrative  appointment as Court physician to Monseigneur le Comte d'Artois, and  gave up the profession of medicine for that of journalist and  politician. Politician! Heaven help him! He belongs to the most  bloodthirsty section of revolutionary brigands. His creed is pillage,  murder, and revenge; and he chooses to declare that it is I who, by  rejecting his love, drove him to these foul extremities. May God forgive  him that abominable lie! The evil we do, Monsieur, is within us; it does  not come from circumstance. I, in the meanwhile, was a happy wife. My  husband, M. de Lannoy, who was an officer in the army, idolised me. We  had one child, a boy--\"    She paused, with another catch in her throat. Then she resumed, with  calmness that, in view of the tale she told, sounded strangely weird:    \"In June last year my child was stolen from me--stolen by Marat in  hideous revenge for the supposed wrong which I had done him. The details  of that execrable outrage are of no importance. I was decoyed from home  one day through the agency of a forged message purporting to come from a  very dear friend whom I knew to be in grave trouble at the time. Oh! the  whole thing was thoroughly well thought out, I can assure you!\" she  continued, with a harsh laugh which ended in a heartrending sob. \"The  forged message, the suborned servant, the threats of terrible reprisals  if anyone in the village gave me the slightest warning or clue. When the  whole miserable business was accomplished, I was just like a trapped  animal inside a cage, held captive by immovable bars of obstinate  silence and cruel indifference. No one would help me. No one ostensibly  knew anything; no one had seen anything, heard anything. The child was  gone!

[After these sketches had gone through the press, and  were ready for the binder, we sent Mr. Slick a copy; and  shortly afterwards received from him the following letter,  which characteristic communication we give entire--EDITOR.]    To MR. HOWE,    SIR.--I received your letter, and note its contents; I  aint over half pleased, I tell you; I think I have been  used scandalous, that's a fact. It warn't the part of a  gentleman for to go and pump me arter that fashion and  then go right off and blart it out in print. It was a  nasty dirty mean action, and I don't thank you nor the  Squire a bit for it. It will be more nor a thousand  dollars out of my pocket. There's an eend to the Clock  trade now, and a pretty kettle of fish I've made of it,  hav'nt I? I shall never hear the last on it, and. what  am I to say when I go back to the States? I'll take my  oath I never said one half the stuff he has set down  there; and as for that long lochrum about Mr. Everett,  and the Hon. Alden Gobble, and Minister, there aint a  word of truth in it from beginnin to eend. If ever I  come near hand to him agin, I'll larn him--but never  mind, I say nothin. Now there's one thing I don't cleverly  understand. If this here book is my \"Sayins and Doins,\"  how comes it yourn or the Squire's either? If my thoughts  and notions are my own, how can they be any other folks's?  According to my idee you have no more right to take them,  than you have to take my clocks without payin for 'em.  A man that would be guilty of such an action is no  gentleman, that's flat, and if you don't like it, you  may lump it--for I don't valy him nor you, neither, nor  are a Blue Nose that ever stept in shoe leather the matter  of a pin's head. I don't know as ever I felt so ugly  afore since I was raised; why didn't he put his name to  it, as well as mine? When an article han't the maker's  name and factory on it, it shows its a cheat, and he's  ashamed to own it. If I'm to have the name I'll have the  game, or I'll know the cause why, that's a fact? Now  folks say you are a considerable of a candid man, and  right up and down in your dealins, and do things above  board, handsum--at least so I've hearn tell. That's what  I like; I love to deal with such folks. Now spose you  make me an offer? You'll find me not very difficult to  trade with, and I don't know but I might put off more  than half of the books myself, tu. I'll tell you how I'd  work it. I'd say, \"Here's a book they've namesaked arter  me, Sam Slick the Clockmaker, but it tante mine, and I  can't altogether jist say rightly whose it is. Some say  it's the General's, and some say its the Bishop's, and  some say its Howe himself; but I aint availed who it is.  Its a wise child that knows its own father. It wipes up  the Blue Noses considerable hard, and don't let off the  Yankees so very easy neither, but it's generally allowed  to be about the prettiest book ever writ in this country;  and although it aint altogether jist gospel what's in  it, there's some pretty home truths in it, that's a fact.  Whoever wrote it must be a funny feller, too, that's  sartin; for there are some queer stories in it that no  soul could help larfin at, that's a fact. Its about the  wittiest book I ever seed. Its nearly all sold off, but  jist a few copies I've kept for my old customers. The  price is just 5s. 6d. but I'll let you have it for 5s.  because you'll not get another chance to have one.\" Always  ax a sixpence more than the price, and then bate it, and  when Blue Nose hears that, he thinks he's got a bargain,  and bites directly. I never see one on 'em yet that didn't  fall right into the trap.    Yes, make me an offer, and you and I will trade, I think.  But fair play's a jewel, and I must say I feel ryled and  kinder sore. I han't been used handsum atween you two,  and it don't seem to me that I had ought to be made a  fool on in that book, arter that fashion, for folks to  laugh at, and then be sheered out of the spec. If I am,  somebody had better look out for squalls, I tell you.  I'm as easy as an old glove, but a glove aint an old shoe  to be trod on, and I think a certain person will find  that out afore he is six months older, or else I'm  mistakened, that's all. Hopin to hear from you soon, I  remain yours to command,    SAMUEL SLICK.    Pugnose's Inn, River Philip, Dec. 25,1836.    P.S. I see in the last page it is writ, that the Squire  is to take another journey round the Shore, and back to  Halifax with me next Spring. Well, I did agree with him,  to drive him round the coast, but don't you mind--we'll  understand each other, I guess, afore we start. I concait  he'll rise considerable airly in the mornin, afore he  catches me asleep agin. I'll be wide awake for him next  hitch, that's a fact. I'd a ginn a thousand dollars if  he had only used Campbell's name instead of mine; for he  was a most an almighty villain, and cheated a proper raft  of folks, and then shipped himself off to Botany Bay,  for fear folks would transport him there; you couldnt  rub out Slick, and put in Campbell, could you? that's a  good feller; if you would I'd make it worth your while,  you may depend.          THE CLOCKMAKER          No. I    The Trotting Horse.    I was always well mounted; I am fond of a horse, and  always piqued myself on having the fastest trotter in  the Province. I have made no great progress in the world,  I feel doubly, therefore, the pleasure of not being  surpassed on the road. I never feel so well or so cheerful  as on horseback, for there is something exhilirating in  quick motion; and, old as I am, I feel a pleasure in  making any person whom I meet on the way put his horse  to the full gallop, to keep pace with my trotter. Poor  Ethiope! you recollect him, how he was wont to lay back  his ears on his arched neck, and push away from all  competition. He is done, poor fellow! the spavin spoiled  his speed, and he now roams at large upon 'my farm at  Truro.' Mohawk never failed me till this summer, I pride  myself (you may laugh at such childish weakness in a man  of my age,) but still, I pride myself in taking the  concert out of coxcombs I meet on the road, and on the  ease with which I can leave a fool behind, whose nonsense  disturbs my solitary musings, On my last journey to Fort  Lawrence, as the beautiful view of Colchester had just  opened upon me, and as I was contemplating its richness  and exquisite scenery, a tall thin man, with hollow cheeks  and bright twinkling black eyes, on a good bay horse,  somewhat out of condition, overtook me; and drawing up,  said, I guess you started early this morning, Sir? I did,  Sir, I replied. You did not come from Halifax, I presume,  Sir, did you? in a dialect too rich to be mistaken as  genuine Yankee. And which way may you be travelling?  asked my inquisitive companion. To Fort Lawrence. Ah!  said he, so am I, it is IN MY CIRCUIT. The word CIRCUIT  sounded so professional, I looked again at him, to  ascertain whether I had ever seen him before, or whether  I had met with one of those nameless, but innumerable  limbs of the law, who now flourish in every district of  the Province. There was a keenness about his eye, and an  acuteness of expression, much in favor of the law; but  the dress, and general bearing of the man, made against  the supposition. His was not the coat of a man who can  afford to wear an old coat, nor was it one of 'Tempest  & More's,' that distinguish country lawyers from country  boobies. His clothes were well made, and of good materials,  but looked as if their owner had shrunk a little since  they were made for him; they hung somewhat loose on him.  A large brooch, and some superfluous seals and gold keys,  which ornamented his outward man, looked 'New England'  like. A visit to the States, had perhaps, I thought,  turned this Colchester beau into a Yankee fop. Of what  consequence was it to me who he was--in either case I  had nothing to do with him, and I desired neither his  acquaintance nor his company--still I could not but ask  myself who can this man be? I am not "]]]
