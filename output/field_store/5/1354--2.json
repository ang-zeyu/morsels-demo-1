There is  novelty, however, in the fact of bringing them together, and  exhibiting them in their connection, and also, I believe, in much that  is brought forward in their support. Several of the opinions at all  events, if not new, are for the present as little likely to meet with  general acceptance as if they were.    It seems to me, however, from various indications, and from none more  than the recent debates on Reform of Parliament, that both  Conservatives and Liberals (if I may continue to call them what they  still call themselves) have lost confidence in the political creeds  which they nominally profess, while neither side appears to have made  any progress in providing itself with a better. Yet such a better  doctrine must be possible; not a mere compromise, by splitting the  difference between the two, but something wider than either, which, in  virtue of its superior comprehensiveness, might be adopted by either  Liberal or Conservative without renouncing any thing which he really  feels to be valuable in his own creed. When so many feel obscurely the  want of such a doctrine, and so few even flatter themselves that they  have attained it, any one may without presumption, offer what his own  thoughts, and the best that he knows of those of others, are able to  contribute towards its formation.

All speculations concerning forms of government bear the impress, more  or less exclusive, of two conflicting theories respecting political  institutions; or, to speak more properly, conflicting conceptions of  what political institutions are.    By some minds, government is conceived as strictly a practical art,  giving rise to no questions but those of means and an end. Forms of  government are assimilated to any other expedients for the attainment  of human objects. They are regarded as wholly an affair of invention  and contrivance. Being made by man, it is assumed that man has the  choice either to make them or not, and how or on what pattern they  shall be made. Government, according to this conception, is a problem,  to be worked like any other question of business. The first step is to  define the purposes which governments are required to promote. The  next, is to inquire what form of government is best fitted to fulfill  those purposes. Having satisfied ourselves on these two points, and  ascertained the form of government which combines the greatest amount  of good with the least of evil, what further remains is to obtain the  concurrence of our countrymen, or those for whom the institutions are  intended, in the opinion which we have privately arrived at. To find  the best form of government; to persuade others that it is the best;  and, having done so, to stir them up to insist on having it, is the  order of ideas in the minds of those who adopt this view of political  philosophy. They look upon a constitution in the same light  (difference of scale being allowed for) as they would upon a steam  plow, or a threshing machine.    To these stand opposed another kind of political reasoners, who are so  far from assimilating a form of government to a machine, that they  regard it as a sort of spontaneous product, and the science of  government as a branch (so to speak) of natural history. According to  them, forms of government are not a matter of choice. We must take  them, in the main, as we find them. Governments can not be constructed  by premeditated design. They \"are not made, but grow.\" Our business  with them, as with the other facts of the universe, is to acquaint  ourselves with their natural properties, and adapt ourselves to them.  The fundamental political institutions of a people are considered by  this school as a sort of organic growth from the nature and life of  that people; a product of their habits, instincts, and unconscious  wants and desires, scarcely at all of their deliberate purposes. Their  will has had no part in the matter but that of meeting the necessities  of the moment by the contrivances of the moment, which contrivances,  if in sufficient conformity to the national feelings and character,  commonly last, and, by successive aggregation, constitute a polity  suited to the people who possess it, but which it would be vain to  attempt to superinduce upon any people whose nature and circumstances  had not spontaneously evolved it.    It is difficult to decide which of these doctrines would be the most  absurd, if we could suppose either of them held as an exclusive  theory. But the principles which men profess, on any controverted  subject, are usually a very incomplete exponent of the opinions they  really hold. No one believes that every people is capable of working  every sort of institution. Carry the analogy of mechanical  contrivances as far as we will, a man does not choose even an  instrument of timber and iron on the sole ground that it is in itself  the best. He considers whether he possesses the other requisites which  must be combined with it to render its employment advantageous, and,  in particular whether those by whom it will have to be worked possess  the knowledge and skill necessary for its management. On the other  hand, neither are those who speak of institutions as if they were a  kind of living organisms really the political fatalists they give  themselves out to be. They do not pretend that mankind have absolutely  no range of choice as to the government they will live under, or that  a consideration of the consequences which flow from different forms of  polity is no element at all in deciding which of them should be  preferred. But, though each side greatly exaggerates its own theory,  out of opposition to the other, and no one holds without modification  to either, the two doctrines correspond to a deep-seated difference  between two modes of thought; and though it is evident that neither of  these is entirely in the right, yet it being equally evident that  neither is wholly in the wrong, we must endeavour to get down to what  is at the root of each, and avail ourselves of the amount of truth  which exists in either.    Let us remember, then, in the first place, that political institutions  (however the proposition may be at times ignored) are the work of  men--owe their origin and their whole existence to human will. Men did  not wake on a summer morning and find them sprung up. Neither do they  resemble trees, which, once planted, \"are aye growing\" while men \"are  sleeping.\" In every stage of their existence they are made what they  are by human voluntary agency. Like all things, therefore, which are  made by men, they may be either well or ill made; judgment and skill  may have been exercised in their production, or the reverse of these.  And again, if a people have omitted, or from outward pressure have not  had it in their power to give themselves a constitution by the  tentative process of applying a corrective to each evil as it arose,  or as the sufferers gained strength to resist it, this retardation of  political progress is no doubt a great disadvantage to them, but it  does not prove that what has been found good for others would not have  been good also for them, and will not be so still when they think fit  to adopt it.    On the other hand, it is also to be borne in mind that political  machinery does not act of itself. As it is first made, so it has to be  worked, by men, and even by ordinary men. It needs, not their simple  acquiescence, but their active participation; and must be adjusted to  the capacities and qualities of such men as are available. This  implies three conditions. The people for whom the form of government  is intended must be willing to accept it, or, at least not so  unwilling as to oppose an insurmountable obstacle to its  establishment. They must be willing and able to do what is necessary  to keep it standing. And they must be willing and able to do what it  requires of them to enable it to fulfill its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

SIR CHARLES LYELL    UNIFORMITY IN THE SERIES OF PAST CHANGES IN THE  ANIMATE AND INANIMATE WORLD SIR CHARLES LYELL          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    Hippocrates, the celebrated Greek physician, was a contemporary  of the historian Herodotus. He was born in the island of Cos  between 470 and 460 B. C., and belonged to the family that  claimed descent from the mythical AEsculapius, son of Apollo.  There was already a long medical tradition in Greece before his  day, and this he is supposed to have inherited chiefly through  his predecessor Herodicus; and he enlarged his education by  extensive travel. He is said, though the evidence is  unsatisfactory, to have taken part in the efforts to check the  great plague which devastated Athens at the beginning of the  Peloponnesian war. He died at Larissa between 380 and 360 B. C.    The works attributed to Hippocrates are the earliest extant Greek  medical writings, but very many of them are certainly not his.  Some five or six, however, are generally granted to be genuine,  and among these is the famous \"Oath.\" This interesting document  shows that in his time physicians were already organized into a  corporation or guild, with regulations for the training of  disciples, and with an esprit de corps and a professional ideal  which, with slight exceptions, can hardly yet be regarded as out  of date.    One saying occurring in the words of Hippocrates has achieved  universal currency, though few who quote it to-day are aware that  it originally referred to the art of the physician. It is the  first of his \"Aphorisms\": \"Life is short, and the Art long; the  occasion fleeting; experience fallacious, and judgment difficult.  The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right  himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and  externals cooperate.\"          THE OATH OF HIPPOCRATES    I swear by Apollo the physician and AEsculapius, and Health, and  All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my  ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this stipulation  --to reckon him who taught me this Art equally dear to me as my  parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve his  necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the same  footing as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they  shall wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation; and that by  precept, lecture, and every other mode of instruction, I will  impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those of my  teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath  according to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will  follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and  judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain  from whatever is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no  deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such  counsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary  to produce abortion. With purity and with holiness I will pass my  life and practice my Art. I will not cut persons labouring under  the stone, but will leave this to be done by men who are  practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses I enter, I will  go into them for the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from  every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and, further,  from the seduction of females or males, of freemen and slaves.  Whatever, in connection with my professional practice, or not in  connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which  ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as  reckoning that all such should be kept secret. While I continue  to keep this Oath unviolated, may it be granted to me to enjoy  life and the practice of the art, respected by all men, in all  times. But should I trespass and violate this Oath, may the  reverse be my lot.          THE LAW OF HIPPOCRATES    Medicine is of all the arts the most noble; but, owing to the  ignorance of those who practice it, and of those who,  inconsiderately, form a judgment of them, it is at present far  behind all the other arts. Their mistake appears to me to arise  principally from this, that in the cities there is no punishment  connected with the practice of medicine (and with it alone)  except disgrace, and that does not hurt those who are familiar  with it. Such persons are like the figures which are introduced  in tragedies, for as they have the shape, and dress, and personal  appearance of an actor, but are not actors, so also physicians  are many in title but very few in reality.    2. Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine, ought  to be possessed of the following advantages: a natural  disposition; instruction; a favorable position for the study;  early tuition; love of labour; leisure. First of all, a natural  talent is required; for, when Nature leads the way to what is  most excellent, instruction in the art takes place, which the  student must try to appropriate to himself by reflection,  becoming an early pupil in a place well adapted for instruction.  He must also bring to the task a love of labour and perseverance,  so that the instruction taking root may bring forth proper and  abundant fruits.    3. Instruction in medicine is like the culture of the productions  of the earth. For our natural disposition, is, as it were, the  soil; the tenets of our teacher are, as it were, the seed;  instruction in youth is like the planting of the seed in the  ground at the proper season; the place where the instruction is  communicated is like the food imparted to vegetables by the  atmosphere; diligent study is like the cultivation of the fields;  and it is time which imparts strength to all things and brings  them to maturity.    4. Having brought all these requisites to the study of medicine,  and having acquired a true knowledge of it, we shall thus, in  travelling through the cities, be esteemed physicians not only in  name but in reality. But inexperience is a bad treasure, and a  bad fund to those who possess it, whether in opinion or reality,  being devoid of self-reliance and contentedness, and the nurse  both of timidity and audacity. For timidity betrays a want of  powers, and audacity a lack of skill. They are, indeed, two  things, knowledge and opinion, of which the one makes its  possessor really to know, the other to be ignorant.    5. Those things which are sacred, are to be imparted only to  sacred persons; and it is not lawful to impart them to the  profane until they have been initiated in the mysteries of the  science.          JOURNEYS IN DIVERSE PLACES    BY AMBROISE PARE    TRANSLATED BY STEPHEN PAGET      Ambroise Pare was born in the village of Bourg-Hersent, near  Laval, in Maine, France, about 1510. He was trained as a barber-  surgeon at a time when a barber-surgeon was inferior to a surgeon  and the professions of surgeon and physician were kept apart by  the law of the Church that forbade a physician to shed blood.  Under whom he served his apprenticeship is unknown, but by 1533  he was in Paris, where he received an appointment as house  surgeon at the Hotel Dieu. After three or four years of valuable  experience in this hospital, he set up in private practise in  Paris, but for the next thirty years he was there only in the  intervals of peace; the rest of the time he followed the army. He  became a master barber-surgeon in 1541.    In Pare's time the armies of Europe were not regularly equipped  with a medical service. The great nobles were accompanied by  their private physicians; the common soldiers doctored  themselves, or used the services of barber-surgeons and quacks  who accompanied the army as adventurers. \"When Pare joined the  army\" says Paget, \"he went simply as a follower of Colonel  Montejan, having neither rank, recognition, nor regular payment.  His fees make up in romance for their irregularity: a cask of  wine, fifty double ducats and a horse, a diamond, a collection of  crowns and half-crowns from the ranks, other honorable presents  and of great value'; from the King himself, three hundred crowns,  and a promise he would never let him be in want; another diamond,  this time from the finger of a duchess: and a soldier once  offered a bag of gold to him.\"    When Pare was a man of seventy, the Dean of the Faculty of  Medicine in Paris made an attack on him on account of his use of  the ligature instead of cauterizing after amputation. In answer,  Pare appealed to his successful experience, and narrated the  \"Journeys in Diverse Places\" here printed. This entertaining  volume gives a vivid picture, not merely of the condition of  surgery in the sixteenth century, but of the military life of the  time; and reveals incidentally a personality of remarkable vigor  and charm. Pare's own achievements are recorded with modest  satisfaction: \"I dressed him, and God healed him,\" is the  refrain. Pare died in Paris in"]]]
