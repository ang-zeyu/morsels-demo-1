FIRST SCENE      _At the bottom of the Rhine_      _A greenish twilight, lighter above than below. The upper part is filled  with undulating water, which streams respectively from right to left.  Towards the bottom the waves resolve themselves into a mist which  grows finer as it descends, so that a space, as high as a mans body  from the ground, appears to be quite free from the water, which  floats like a train of clouds over the gloomy stretch below. Steep  rocky peaks jut up everywhere from the depths, and enclose the entire  stage. The ground is a wild confusion of jagged rocks, no part of  it being quite level, and on every side deeper fisures are indicated  by a still denser gloom. Woglinde circles with graceful swimming  movements round the central rock._        WOGLINDE          Weia! Waga!        Roll, O ye billows,        Rock ye our cradle!        Wagala weia!    Wallala, weiala, weia!    WELLGUNDE [_From above._          Woglinde, watchest alone?    WOGLINDE          If Wellgunde came we were two.    WELLGUNDE [_Dives down to the rock_.          How keepest thou watch?    WOGLINDE [_Swimming off, eludes her_.          Wary of thee.            [_They playfully tease and chase one another_.    FLOSSHILDE [_From above_.          Heiaha weia!        Ho! ye wild sisters!    WELLGUNDE          Flosshilde, swim!        Woglinde flies:    Help me to hinder her flying.    FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down between the two at play._          The sleeping gold        Badly ye guard;        Watch with more zeal        The slumberer's bed,    Or dear you'll pay for your sport!            [_They swim asunder with merry cries. Flosshilde          tries to catch first the one, then the other.          They elude her, and then combine to chase her,          darting like fish from rock to rock with jests and          laughter. Meanwhile Alberich climbs out of a dark          ravine on to a rock. He pauses, still surrounded          by darkness, and watches the frolic of the          Rhine-Maidens with increasing pleasure._    ALBERICH          Hey, hey! ye nixies!        Ye are a lovely,        Lovable folk!        From Nibelheim's night        Fain would I come,    Would ye be kind to me.            [_The maidens, as soon as they hear Alberich's          voice, stop playing._    WOGLINDE          Hei! Who is there?    WELLGUNDE          A voice! It grows dark!    FLOSSHILDE          Who listens below?            [_They dive down and see the Nibelung._    WOGLINDE and WELLGUNDE          Fie! the loathsome one!    [Illustration: Plate 02, The frolic of the Rhine-Maidens.]    FLOSSHILDE [_Swimming up quickly._          Look to the gold!        Father warned us        Of such a foe.            [Both the others follow her, and all three gather          quickly round the central rock.    ALBERICH          You above there!    THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS          What wouldst thou below there?    ALBERICH          Do I spoil sport        By standing and gazing here?        Dived ye but deeper,        Fain the Niblung    Would join in your frolic and play.    WELLGUNDE          He wishes to join us?    WOGLINDE          Is he in jest?    ALBERICH          Ye gleam above me        So glad and fair!        If one would only    Glide down, how close in my arms    Fondly clasped she would be!    FLOSSHILDE          I laugh at my fears:        The foe is in love.    WELLGUNDE          The amorous imp!    WOGLINDE          Let us approach him.            [She sinks down to the top of the rock, whose base          Alberich has reached.    ALBERICH          Lo! one of them comes!    WOGLINDE          Climb up to me here!    ALBERICH            [_Climbs with gnome-like agility, though with          repeated checks, to the summit of the rock.          Irritably._          Horrid rock,        So slippery, slimy!        I slide and slip!        My hands and feet vainly        Attempt to hold on        To the slithery surface!        Vapour damp        Fills up my nostrils--        Accursed sneezing!            [_He has got near Woglinde,_    WOGLINDE [_Laughing._          Sneezing tells        That my suitor comes!    ALBERICH          Be thou my love!        Adorable child!            [_He tries to embrace her._    WOGLINDE [_Escaping from him._          Here thou must woo,        If woo me thou wilt!            [_She swims up to another rock._    ALBERICH [_Scratching his head._          Alas! not yet caught?        Come but closer!        Hard I found    What so lightly thou didst.    WOGLINDE [_Swims to a third rock lower down._          Deeper descend:        Thou'lt certainly seize me!    ALBERICH [_Clambers down quickly._          Down there it is better!    WOGLINDE [_Darts upwards to a higher rock at the side._          But better still higher!    WELLGUNDE AND FLOSSHILDE [_Laughing_          Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!    ALBERICH          How capture this coy,        Elusive fish?        Wait for me, false one!            [_He tries to climb after her in haste._    WELLGUNDE            [_Has sunk down to a lower rock on the other side._          Heia! my friend there!

Toto is in this story, because you  wanted him to be there, and many other characters which you will  recognize are in the story, too.  Indeed, the wishes of my little  correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible, and if  the story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves, you  must remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written  down, and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it.    In the preface to \"Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz\" I said I would like to  write some stories that were not \"Oz\" stories, because I thought I had  written about Oz long enough; but since that volume was published I  have been fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to  \"write more about Dorothy,\" and \"more about Oz,\" and since I write only  to please the children I shall try to respect their wishes.    There are some new characters in this book that ought to win your love.  I'm very fond of the shaggy man myself, and I think you will like him,  too.  As for Polychrome--the Rainbow's Daughter--and stupid little  Button-Bright, they seem to have brought a new element of fun into  these Oz stories, and I am glad I discovered them.  Yet I am anxious to  have you write and tell me how you like them.    Since this book was written I have received some very remarkable News  from The Land of Oz, which has greatly astonished me.  I believe it  will astonish you, too, my dears, when you hear it.  But it is such a  long and exciting story that it must be saved for another book--and  perhaps that book will be the last story that will ever be told about  the Land of Oz.    L. FRANK BAUM    Coronado, 1909.          1.  The Way to Butterfield      \"Please, miss,\" said the shaggy man, \"can you tell me the road to  Butterfield?\"    Dorothy looked him over.  Yes, he was shaggy, all right, but there was  a twinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant.    \"Oh yes,\" she replied; \"I can tell you.  But it isn't this road at all.\"    \"No?\"    \"You cross the ten-acre lot, follow the lane to the highway, go north  to the five branches, and take--let me see--\"    \"To be sure, miss; see as far as Butterfield, if you like,\" said the  shaggy man.    \"You take the branch next the willow stump, I b'lieve; or else the  branch by the gopher holes; or else--\"    \"Won't any of 'em do, miss?\"    \"'Course not, Shaggy Man.  You must take the right road to get to  Butterfield.\"    \"And is that the one by the gopher stump, or--\"    \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy.  \"I shall have to show you the way, you're so  stupid.  Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet.\"    The shaggy man waited.  He had an oat-straw in his mouth, which he  chewed slowly as if it tasted good; but it didn't.  There was an  apple-tree beside the house, and some apples had fallen to the ground.  The shaggy man thought they would taste better than the oat-straw, so  he walked over to get some.  A little black dog with bright brown eyes  dashed out of the farm-house and ran madly toward the shaggy man, who  had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide  pockets of his shaggy coat.  The little dog barked and made a dive for  the shaggy man's leg; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in  his big pocket along with the apples.  He took more apples, afterward,  for many were on the ground; and each one that he tossed into his  pocket hit the little dog somewhere upon the head or back, and made him  growl.  The little dog's name was Toto, and he was sorry he had been  put in the shaggy man's pocket.    Pretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet, and she  called out:    \"Come on, Shaggy Man, if you want me to show you the road to  Butterfield.\"  She climbed the fence into the ten-acre lot and he  followed her, walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in  the pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice  them.    \"My, but you're clumsy!\" said the little girl.  \"Are your feet tired?\"    \"No, miss; it's my whiskers; they tire very easily in this warm  weather,\" said he.  \"I wish it would snow, don't you?\"    \"'Course not, Shaggy Man,\" replied Dorothy, giving him a severe look.  \"If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the  wheat; and then Uncle Henry wouldn't have any crops; and that would  make him poor; and--\"    \"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man.  \"It won't snow, I guess.  Is this  the lane?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Dorothy, climbing another fence; \"I'll go as far as the  highway with you.\"    \"Thankee, miss; you're very kind for your size, I'm sure,\" said he  gratefully.    \"It isn't everyone who knows the road to Butterfield,\" Dorothy remarked  as she tripped along the lane; \"but I've driven there many a time with  Uncle Henry, and so I b'lieve I could find it blindfolded.\"    \"Don't do that, miss,\" said the shaggy man earnestly; \"you might make a  mistake.\"    \"I won't,\" she answered, laughing.  \"Here's the highway.  Now it's the  second--no, the third turn to the left--or else it's the fourth.  Let's  see.  The first one is by the elm tree, and the second is by the gopher  holes; and then--\"    \"Then what?\" he inquired, putting his hands in his coat pockets.  Toto  grabbed a finger and bit it; the shaggy man took his hand out of that  pocket quickly, and said \"Oh!\"    Dorothy did not notice.  She was shading her eyes from the sun with her  arm, looking anxiously down the road.    \"Come on,\" she commanded.  \"It's only a little way farther, so I may as  well show you.\"    After a while, they came to the place where five roads branched in  different directions; Dorothy pointed to one, and said:    \"That's it, Shaggy Man.\"    \"I'm much obliged, miss,\" he said, and started along another road.    \"Not that one!\" she cried; \"you're going wrong.\"    He stopped.    \"I thought you said that other was the road to Butterfield,\" said he,  running his fingers through his shaggy whiskers in a puzzled way.    \"So it is.\"    \"But I don't want to go to Butterfield, miss.\"    \"You don't?\"    \"Of course not.  I wanted you to show me the road, so I shouldn't go  there by mistake.\"    \"Oh!  Where DO you want to go, then?\"    \"I'm not particular, miss.\"    This answer astonished the little girl; and it made her provoked, too,  to think she had taken all this trouble for nothing.    \"There are a good many roads here,\" observed the shaggy man, turning  slowly around, like a human windmill.  \"Seems to me a person could go  'most anywhere, from this place.\"    Dorothy turned around too, and gazed in surprise.  There WERE a good  many roads; more than she had ever seen before.  She tried to count  them, knowing there ought to be five, but when she had counted  seventeen she grew bewildered and stopped, for the roads were as many  as the spokes of a wheel and ran in every direction from the place  where they stood; so if she kept on counting she was likely to count  some of the roads twice.    \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed.  \"There used to be only five roads, highway  and all.  And now--why, where's the highway, Shaggy Man?\"    \"Can't say, miss,\" he responded, sitting down upon the ground as if  tired with standing.  \"Wasn't it here a minute ago?\"    \"I thought so,\" she answered, greatly perplexed.  \"And I saw the gopher  holes, too, and the dead stump; but they're not here now.  These roads  are all strange--and what a lot of them there are!  Where do you  suppose they all go to?\"    \"Roads,\" observed the shaggy man, \"don't go anywhere.  They stay in one  place, so folks can walk on them.\"    He put his hand in his side-pocket and drew out an apple--quick, before  Toto could bite him again.  The little dog got his head out this time  and said \"Bow-wow!\"  so loudly that it made Dorothy jump.    \"O, Toto!\" she cried; \"where did you come from?\"    \"I brought him along,\" said the shaggy man.    \"What for?\" she asked.    \"To guard these apples in my pocket, miss, so no one would steal them.\"    With one hand the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating,  while with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped  him to the ground.  Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking  joyfully at his release from the dark pocket.  When the child had  patted his head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue  hanging out one side of his mouth, and looked up into her face with his  bright brown eyes, as if asking her what they should do next.    Dorothy didn't know.  She looked around her anxiously for some familiar  landmark; but everything was strange.  Between the branches of the many  roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't  see anywhere the farm-house from which she had just come, or"]]]
