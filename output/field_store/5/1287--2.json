CONTENTS        THE STORY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA    ABELARD AND HELOISE    QUEEN ELIZABETH AND THE EARL OF LEICESTER    MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AND LORD BOTHWELL    QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN AND THE MARQUIS MONALDESCHI    KING CHARLES II. AND NELL GWYN    MAURICE OF SAXONY AND ADRIENNE LECOUVREUR    THE STORY OF PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD STUART          THE STORY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA      Of all love stories that are known to human history, the love story of  Antony and Cleopatra has been for nineteen centuries the most  remarkable. It has tasked the resources of the plastic and the graphic  arts. It has been made the theme of poets and of prose narrators. It  has appeared and reappeared in a thousand forms, and it appeals as much  to the imagination to-day as it did when Antony deserted his almost  victorious troops and hastened in a swift galley from Actium in pursuit  of Cleopatra.    The wonder of the story is explained by its extraordinary nature. Many  men in private life have lost fortune and fame for the love of woman.  Kings have incurred the odium of their people, and have cared nothing  for it in comparison with the joys of sense that come from the  lingering caresses and clinging kisses. Cold-blooded statesmen, such as  Parnell, have lost the leadership of their party and have gone down in  history with a clouded name because of the fascination exercised upon  them by some woman, often far from beautiful, and yet possessing the  mysterious power which makes the triumphs of statesmanship seem slight  in comparison with the swiftly flying hours of pleasure.    But in the case of Antony and Cleopatra alone do we find a man flinging  away not merely the triumphs of civic honors or the headship of a  state, but much more than these--the mastery of what was practically  the world--in answer to the promptings of a woman's will. Hence the  story of the Roman triumvir and the Egyptian queen is not like any  other story that has yet been told. The sacrifice involved in it was so  overwhelming, so instantaneous, and so complete as to set this  narrative above all others. Shakespeare's genius has touched it with  the glory of a great imagination. Dryden, using it in the finest of his  plays, expressed its nature in the title \"All for Love.\"    The distinguished Italian historian, Signor Ferrero, the author of many  books, has tried hard to eliminate nearly all the romantic elements  from the tale, and to have us see in it not the triumph of love, but  the blindness of ambition. Under his handling it becomes almost a  sordid drama of man's pursuit of power and of woman's selfishness. Let  us review the story as it remains, even after we have taken full  account of Ferrero's criticism. Has the world for nineteen hundred  years been blinded by a show of sentiment? Has it so absolutely been  misled by those who lived and wrote in the days which followed closely  on the events that make up this extraordinary narrative?    In answering these questions we must consider, in the first place, the  scene, and, in the second place, the psychology of the two central  characters who for so long a time have been regarded as the very  embodiment of unchecked passion.    As to the scene, it must be remembered that the Egypt of those days was  not Egyptian as we understand the word, but rather Greek. Cleopatra  herself was of Greek descent. The kingdom of Egypt had been created by  a general of Alexander the Great after that splendid warrior's death.  Its capital, the most brilliant city of the Greco-Roman world, had been  founded by Alexander himself, who gave to it his name. With his own  hands he traced out the limits of the city and issued the most  peremptory orders that it should be made the metropolis of the entire  world. The orders of a king cannot give enduring greatness to a city;  but Alexander's keen eye and marvelous brain saw at once that the site  of Alexandria was such that a great commercial community planted there  would live and flourish throughout out succeeding ages. He was right;  for within a century this new capital of Egypt leaped to the forefront  among the exchanges of the world's commerce, while everything that art  could do was lavished on its embellishment.    Alexandria lay upon a projecting tongue of land so situated that the  whole trade of the Mediterranean centered there. Down the Nile there  floated to its gates the barbaric wealth of Africa. To it came the  treasures of the East, brought from afar by caravans--silks from China,  spices and pearls from India, and enormous masses of gold and silver  from lands scarcely known. In its harbor were the vessels of every  country, from Asia in the East to Spain and Gaul and even Britain in  the West.    When Cleopatra, a young girl of seventeen, succeeded to the throne of  Egypt the population of Alexandria amounted to a million souls. The  customs duties collected at the port would, in terms of modern money,  amount each year to more than thirty million dollars, even though the  imposts were not heavy. The people, who may be described as Greek at  the top and Oriental at the bottom, were boisterous and  pleasure-loving, devoted to splendid spectacles, with horse-racing,  gambling, and dissipation; yet at the same time they were an artistic  people, loving music passionately, and by no means idle, since one part  of the city was devoted to large and prosperous manufactories of linen,  paper, glass, and muslin.    To the outward eye Alexandria was extremely beautiful. Through its  entire length ran two great boulevards, shaded and diversified by  mighty trees and parterres of multicolored flowers, amid which  fountains plashed and costly marbles gleamed. One-fifth of the whole  city was known as the Royal Residence. In it were the palaces of the  reigning family, the great museum, and the famous library which the  Arabs later burned. There were parks and gardens brilliant with  tropical foliage and adorned with the masterpieces of Grecian  sculpture, while sphinxes and obelisks gave a suggestion of Oriental  strangeness. As one looked seaward his eye beheld over the blue water  the snow-white rocks of the sheltering island, Pharos, on which was  reared a lighthouse four hundred feet in height and justly numbered  among the seven wonders of the world. Altogether, Alexandria was a city  of wealth, of beauty, of stirring life, of excitement, and of pleasure.  Ferrero has aptly likened it to Paris--not so much the Paris of to-day  as the Paris of forty years ago, when the Second Empire flourished in  all its splendor as the home of joy and strange delights.    Over the country of which Alexandria was the capital Cleopatra came to  reign at seventeen. Following the odd custom which the Greek dynasty of  the Ptolemies had inherited from their Egyptian predecessors, she was  betrothed to her own brother. He, however, was a mere child of less  than twelve, and was under the control of evil counselors, who, in his  name, gained control of the capital and drove Cleopatra into exile.  Until then she had been a mere girl; but now the spirit of a woman who  was wronged blazed up in her and called out all her latent powers.  Hastening to Syria, she gathered about herself an army and led it  against her foes.    But meanwhile Julius Caesar, the greatest man of ancient times, had  arrived at Alexandria backed by an army of his veterans. Against him no  resistance would avail. Then came a brief moment during which the  Egyptian king and the Egyptian queen each strove to win the favor of  the Roman imperator. The king and his advisers had many arts, and so  had Cleopatra. One thing, however, she possessed which struck the  balance in her favor, and this was a woman's fascination.    According to the story, Caesar was unwilling to receive her. There came  into his presence, as he sat in the palace, a group of slaves bearing a  long roll of matting, bound carefully and seeming to contain some  precious work of art. The slaves made signs that they were bearing a  gift to Caesar. The master of Egypt bade them unwrap the gift that he  might see it. They did so, and out of the wrapping came Cleopatra--a  radiant vision, appealing, irresistible. Next morning it became known  everywhere that Cleopatra had remained in Caesar's quarters through the  night and that her enemies were now his enemies. In desperation they  rushed upon his legions, casting aside all pretense of amity. There  ensued a fierce contest, but the revolt was quenched in blood.    This was a crucial moment in Cleopatra's life. She had sacrificed all  that a woman has to give; but she had not done so from any love of  pleasure or from wantonness. She was queen of Egypt, and she had  redeemed her kingdom and kept it by her sacrifice. One should not  condemn her too severely. In a sense, her act was one of heroism like  that of Judith in the tent of Holofernes. But beyond all question it  changed her character. It taught her the secret of her own great power.  Henceforth she was no longer a mere girl, nor a woman of the ordinary  type. Her contact with so great a mind as Caesar's quickened her  intellect. Her knowledge that, by the charms of sense, she had mastered  even him transformed her into a strange and wonderful creature. She  learned to study the weaknesses of men, to play on their emotions, to  appeal to every subtle taste and fancy. In her were blended mental  power and that illusive, indefinable gift which is called charm.    For Cleopatra was never beautiful. Signor Ferrero seems to think this  fact to be discovery of his own, but it was set down by Plutarch in a  very striking passage written less than a century after Cleopatra and  Antony died. We may quote here what the Greek historian said of her:    Her actual beauty was far from being so remarkable that none could be  compared with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion.
