Beyond them to the  east there lies a desert, for ever untroubled by man: all yellow it is,  and spotted with shadows of stones, and Death is in it, like a leopard  lying in the sun. To the south they are bounded by magic, to the west by a  mountain, and to the north by the voice and anger of the Polar wind. Like  a great wall is the mountain to the west. It comes up out of the distance  and goes down into the distance again, and it is named Poltarnees,  Beholder of Ocean. To the northward red rocks, smooth and bare of soil,  and without any speck of moss or herbage, slope up to the very lips of the  Polar wind, and there is nothing else there by the noise of his anger.  Very peaceful are the Inner Lands, and very fair are their cities, and  there is no war among them, but quiet and ease. And they have no enemy but  age, for thirst and fever lie sunning themselves out in the mid-desert,  and never prowl into the Inner Lands. And the ghouls and ghosts, whose  highway is the night, are kept in the south by the boundary of magic. And  very small are all their pleasant cities, and all men are known to one  another therein, and bless one another by name as they meet in the  streets. And they have a broad, green way in every city that comes in out  of some vale or wood or downland, and wanders in and out about the city  between the houses and across the streets, and the people walk along it  never at all, but every year at her appointed time Spring walks along it  from the flowery lands, causing the anemone to bloom on the green way and  all the early joys of hidden woods, or deep, secluded vales, or triumphant  downlands, whose heads lift up so proudly, far up aloof from cities.    Sometimes waggoners or shepherds walk along this way, they that have come  into the city from over cloudy ridges, and the townsmen hinder them not,  for there is a tread that troubleth the grass and a tread that troubleth  it not, and each man in his own heart knoweth which tread he hath. And in  the sunlit spaces of the weald and in the wold's dark places, afar from  the music of cities and from the dance of the cities afar, they make there  the music of the country places and dance the country dance. Amiable, near  and friendly appears to these men the sun, and as he is genial to them and  tends their younger vines, so they are kind to the little woodland things  and any rumour of the fairies or old legend. And when the light of some  little distant city makes a slight flush upon the edge of the sky, and the  happy golden windows of the homesteads stare gleaming into the dark, then  the old and holy figure of Romance, cloaked even to the face, comes down  out of hilly woodlands and bids dark shadows to rise and dance, and sends  the forest creatures forth to prowl, and lights in a moment in her bower  of grass the little glowworm's lamp, and brings a hush down over the grey  lands, and out of it rises faintly on far-off hills the voice of a lute.  There are not in the world lands more prosperous and happy than Toldees,  Mondath, Arizim.    From these three little kingdoms that are named the Inner Lands the young  men stole constantly away. One by one they went, and no one knew why they  went save that they had a longing to behold the Sea. Of this longing they  spoke little, but a young man would become silent for a few days, and  then, one morning very early, he would slip away and slowly climb  Poltarnee's difficult slope, and having attained the top pass over and  never return. A few stayed behind in the Inner Lands and became the old  men, but none that had ever climbed Poltarnees from the very earliest  times had ever come back again. Many had gone up Poltarnees sworn to  return. Once a king sent all his courtiers, one by one, to report the  mystery to him, and then went himself; none ever returned.    Now, it was the wont of the folk of the Inner Lands to worship rumours and  legends of the Sea, and all that their prophets discovered of the Sea was  writ in a sacred book, and with deep devotion on days of festival or  mourning read in the temples by the priests. Now, all their temples lay  open to the west, resting upon pillars, that the breeze from the Sea might  enter them, and they lay open on pillars to the east that the breezes of  the Sea might not be hindered by pass onward wherever the Sea list. And  this is the legend that they had of the Sea, whom none in the Inner Lands  had ever beholden. They say that the Sea is a river heading towards  Hercules, and they say that he touches against the edge of the world, and  that Poltarnees looks upon him. They say that all the worlds of heaven go  bobbing on this river and are swept down with the stream, and that  Infinity is thick and furry with forests through which the river in his  course sweeps on with all the worlds of heaven. Among the colossal trunks  of those dark trees, the smallest fronds of whose branches are man nights,  there walk the gods. And whenever its thirst, glowing in space like a  great sun, comes upon the beast, the tiger of the gods creeps down to the  river to drink. And the tiger of the gods drinks his fill loudly, whelming  worlds the while, and the level of the river sinks between its banks ere  the beast's thirst is quenched and ceases to glow like a sun. And many  worlds thereby are heaped up dry and stranded, and the gods walk not among  them evermore, because they are hard to their feet. These are the worlds  that have no destiny, whose people know no god. And the river sweeps  onwards ever. And the name of the River is Oriathon, but men call it  Ocean. This is the Lower Faith of the Inner Lands. And there is a Higher  Faith which is not told to all. Oriathon sweeps on through the forests of  Infinity and all at once falls roaring over an Edge, whence Time has long  ago recalled his hours to fight in his war with the gods; and falls unlit  by the flash of nights and days, with his flood unmeasured by miles, into  the deeps of nothing.    Now as the centuries went by and the one way by which a man could climb  Poltarnees became worn with feet, more and more men surmounted it, not to  return. And still they knew not in the Inner Lands upon what mystery  Poltarnees looked. For on a still day and windless, while men walked  happily about their beautiful streets or tended flocks in the country,  suddenly the west wind would bestir himself and come in from the Sea. And  he would come cloaked and grey and mournful and carry to someone the  hungry cry of the Sea calling out for bones of men. And he that heard it  would move restlessly for some hours, and at last would rise suddenly,  irresistibly up, setting his face to Poltarnees, and would say, as is the  custom of those lands when men part briefly, \"Till a man's heart  remembereth,\" which means \"Farewell for a while\"; but those that loved  him, seeing his eyes on Poltarnees, would answer sadly, \"Till the gods  forget,\" which means \"Farewell.\"    Now the king of Arizim had a daughter who played with the wild wood  flowers, and with the fountains in her father's court, and with the little  blue heaven-birds that came to her doorway in the winter to shelter from  the snow. And she was more beautiful than the wild wood flowers, or than  all the fountains in her father's court, or than the blue heaven-birds in  their full winter plumage when they shelter from the snow. The old wise  kings of Mondath and of Toldees saw her once as she went lightly down the  little paths of her garden, and turning their gaze into the mists of  thought, pondered the destiny of their Inner Lands. And they watched her  closely by the stately flowers, and standing alone in the sunlight, and  passing and repassing the strutting purple birds that the king's fowlers  had brought from Asagehon. When she was of the age of fifteen years the  King of Mondath called a council of kings. And there met with him the  kings of Toldees and Arizim. And the King of Mondath in his Council said:    \"The call of the unappeased and hungry Sea (and at the word 'Sea' the  three kings bowed their heads) lures every year out of our happy kingdoms  more and more of our men, and still we know not the mystery of the Sea,  and no devised oath has brought one man back. Now thy daughter, Arizim, is  lovelier than the sunlight, and lovelier than those stately flowers of  thine that stand so tall in her garden, and hath more grace and beauty  than those strange birds that the venturous fowlers bring in creaking  wagons out of Asagehon, whose feathers are alternate purple and white.  Now, he that shall love thy daughter, Hilnaric, whoever he shall be, is  the man to climb Poltarnees and return, as none hath ever before, and tell  us upon what Poltarnees looks; for it may be that they daughter is more  beautiful than the Sea.\"    Then from his Seat of Council arose the King of Arizim. He said: \"I fear  that thou hast spoken blasphemy against the Sea, and I have a dread that  ill will come of it. Indeed I had not thought she was so fair. It is such  a short while ago that she was quite a small child with her hair still  unkempt and not yet attired in the manner of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#1)"],[1,"OF TOLSTOY    BY HIS SON,    Count Ilya Tolstoy      Translated By George Calderon          REMINISCENCES OF TOLSTOY (Part I.)    IN one of his letters to his great-aunt, Alexandra Andreyevna Tolstoy,  my father gives the following description of his children:    The eldest [Sergei] is fair-haired and good-looking; there is something  weak and patient in his expression, and very gentle. His laugh is not  infectious; but when he cries, I can hardly refrain from crying, too.  Every one says he is like my eldest brother.    I am afraid to believe it. It is too good to be true. My brother's chief  characteristic was neither egotism nor self-renunciation, but a strict  mean between the two. He never sacrificed himself for any one else; but  not only always avoided injuring others, but also interfering with them.  He kept his happiness and his sufferings entirely to himself.    Ilya, the third, has never been ill in his life; broad-boned, white and  pink, radiant, bad at lessons. Is always thinking about what he is told  not to think about. Invents his own games. Hot-tempered and violent,  wants to fight at once; but is also tender-hearted and very sensitive.  Sensuous; fond of eating and lying still doing nothing.    Tanya [Tatyana] is eight years old. Every one says that she is like  Sonya, and I believe them, although I am pleased about that, too; I  believe it only because it is obvious. If she had been Adam's eldest  daughter and he had had no other children afterward, she would have  passed a wretched childhood. The greatest pleasure that she has is to  look after children.    The fourth is Lyoff. Handsome, dexterous, good memory, graceful. Any  clothes fit him as if they had been made for him. Everything that others  do, he does very skilfully and well. Does not understand much yet.    The fifth, Masha [Mary] is two years old, the one whose birth nearly  cost Sonya her life. A weak and sickly child. Body white as milk, curly  white hair; big, queer blue eyes, queer by reason of their deep, serious  expression. Very intelligent and ugly. She will be one of the riddles;  she will suffer, she will seek and find nothing, will always be seeking  what is least attainable.    The sixth, Peter, is a giant, a huge, delightful baby in a mob-cap,  turns out his elbows, strives eagerly after something. My wife falls  into an ecstasy of agitation and emotion when she holds him in her arms;  but I am completely at a loss to understand. I know that he has a great  store of physical energy, but whether there is any purpose for which the  store is wanted I do not know. That is why I do not care for children  under two or three; I don't understand.      This letter was written in 1872, when I was six years old. My  recollections date from about that time. I can remember a few things  before.          FAMILY LIFE IN THE COUNTRY    FROM my earliest childhood until the family moved into Moscow--that  was in 1881--all my life was spent, almost without a break, at Yasnaya  Polyana.    This is how we live. The chief personage in the house is my mother. She  settles everything. She interviews Nikolai, the cook, and orders dinner;  she sends us out for walks, makes our shirts, is always nursing some  baby at the breast; all day long she is bustling about the house with  hurried steps. One can be naughty with her, though she is sometimes  angry and punishes us.    She knows more about everything than anybody else. She knows that one  must wash every day, that one must eat soup at dinner, that one must  talk French, learn not to crawl about on all fours, not to put one's  elbows on the table; and if she says that one is not to go out walking  because it is just going to rain, she is sure to be right, and one must  do as she says.    Papa is the cleverest man in the world. He always knows everything.  There is no being naughty with HIM. When he is up in his study  \"working,\" one is not allowed to make a noise, and nobody may go into  his room. What he does when he is at \"work,\" none of us know. Later on,  when I had learned to read, I was told that papa was a \"writer.\"    This was how I learned. I was very pleased with some lines of poetry one  day, and asked my mother who wrote them. She told me they were written  by Pushkin, and Pushkin was a great writer. I was vexed at my father not  being one, too. Then my mother said that my father was also a well-known  writer, and I was very glad indeed.    At the dinner-table papa sits opposite mama and has his own round silver  spoon. When old Natalia Petrovna, who lives on the floor below with  great-aunt Tatyana Alexandrovna, pours herself out a glass of kvass,  he picks it up and drinks it right off, then says, \"Oh, I'm so sorry,  Natalia Petrovna; I made a mistake!\" We all laugh delightedly, and it  seems odd that papa is not in the least afraid of Natalia Petrovna. When  there is jelly for pudding, papa says it is good for gluing paper boxes;  we run off to get some paper, and papa makes it into boxes. Mama is  angry, but he is not afraid of her either. We have the gayest times  imaginable with him now and then. He can ride a horse better and run  faster than anybody else, and there is no one in the world so strong as  he is.    He hardly ever punishes us, but when he looks me in the eyes he knows  everything that I think, and I am frightened. You can tell stories  to mama, but not to papa, because he will see through you at once. So  nobody ever tries.    Besides papa and mama, there was also Aunt Tatyana Alexandrovna  Yergolsky. In her room she had a big eikon with a silver mount. We were  very much afraid of this eikon, because it was very old and black.    When I was six, I remember my father teaching the village children. They  had their lessons in \"the other house,\" [1] where Alexey Stepanytch, the  bailiff, lived, and sometimes on the ground floor of the house we lived  in.    There were a great number of village children who used to come. When  they came, the front hall smelled of sheepskin jackets; they were taught  by papa and Seryozha and Tanya and Uncle Kostya all at once. Lesson-time  was very gay and lively.    The children did exactly as they pleased, sat where they liked, ran  about from place to place, and answered questions not one by one, but  all together, interrupting one another, and helping one another to  recall what they had read. If one left out a bit, up jumped another  and then another, and the story or sum was reconstructed by the united  efforts of the whole class.    What pleased my father most about his pupils was the picturesqueness and  originality of their language. He never wanted a literal repetition of  bookish expressions, and particularly encouraged every one to speak \"out  of his own head.\" I remember how once he stopped a boy who was running  into the next room.    \"Where are YOU off to?\" he asked.    \"To uncle, to bite off a piece of chalk.\" [2]    \"Cut along, cut along! It's not for us to teach them, but for them to  teach.\"          THE SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE    WHEN my father married and brought home his young and inexperienced  bride, Sofya Andreyevna, to Yasnaya Polyana, Nikolai Mikhailovitch  Rumyantsef was already established as cook. Before my father's marriage  he had a salary of five rubles a month; but when my mother arrived, she  raised him to six, at which rate he continued the rest of his days; that  is, till somewhere about the end of the eighties. He was succeeded in  the kitchen by his son, Semyon Nikolayevitch, my mother's godson, and  this worthy and beloved man, companion of my childish games, still  lives with us to this day. Under my mother's supervision he prepared  my father's vegetarian diet with affectionate zeal, and without him my  father would very likely never have lived to the ripe old age he did.    Agafya Mikhailovna was an old woman who lived at first in the kitchen  of \"the other house\" and afterward on the home farm. Tall and thin, with  big, thoroughbred eyes, and long, straight hair, like a witch, turning  gray, she was rather terrifying, but more than anything else she was  queer.    Once upon a time long ago she had been housemaid to my  great-grandmother, Countess Pelageya Nikolayevna Tolstoy, my father's  grandmother, nee Princess Gortchakova. She was fond of telling about her  young days. She would say:    I was very handsome. When there were gentlefolks visiting at the big  house, the countess would call me, 'Gachette [Agafya], femme de chambre,  apportez-moi un mouchoir!' Then I would say, 'Toute suite, Madame la  Comtesse!' And every one would be staring at me, and couldn't take their  eyes off. When I crossed over to the annex, there they were watching  to catch me on the way. Many a time have I tricked them--ran round the  other way and jumped over the ditch. I never liked that sort of thing  any time. A maid I was, a maid I am.      After my grandmother's death, Agafya Mikhailovna was sent on to the home  farm for some reason or other, and minded the sheep. She got so fond of  sheep that all her days after she never would touch mutton.    After the sheep, she had an affection for dogs, and that is the only  period of her life that I remember her in.    There was nothing in the world she cared about but dogs. She lived with  them in horrible dirt and smells, and gave up her whole mind and soul  to them. We always had setters, harriers, and borzois, and the whole  kennel, often very numerous, was under Agafya Mikhailovna's management,  with some boy or other to help her, usually one as clumsy and stupid as  could be found.    There are many interesting recollections bound up with the memory of  this intelligent and original woman. Most of them are associated in  my mind with my father's stories about her. He could always catch and  unravel any interesting psychological trait, and these traits, which he  would mention incidentally, stuck firmly in my mind. He used to tell,  for instance, "]]]
