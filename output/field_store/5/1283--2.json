Al-Mutanabbi    [p.xv]    PREFACE TO THE MEMORIAL EDITION.    AFTER my beloved husband had passed away from amongst us, after the  funeral had taken place, and I had settled in England, I began to think  in what way I could render him the most honour. A material Monument to  his memory has already been erected by his countrymen in the shape of a  handsome contribution to the beautiful Mausoleum-tent in stone and  marble to contain his remains; but I also hoped to erect a less  material, but more imperishable, Monument to his name, by making this  unique hero better known to his countrymen by his Works, which have  hitherto not been sufficiently known, not extensively enough published,  and issued perhaps at a prohibitive price. Viewing the long list of  Works written by him between 1842 and 1890, many of which are still  unpublished, I was almost disheartened by the magnitude of the work,  until the Publishers, Messrs. Tylston and Edwards, fully appreciating  the interest with which the British Public had followed my husband's  adventurous career and fearless enterprise, arranged to produce this  uniform Memorial Edition at their own expense.    [p.xvi]Mr. Leonard Smithers, a man of great literary talent and of  indefatigable energy, who admired and collaborated with my husband in  the traduction of Latin Classics for two years before he died, has also  kindly volunteered to be my working assistant and to join with me in  the editing.    My part is to give up all my copyrights, and to search out such papers,  annotations, and latest notes and corrections, as will form the most  complete work; also to write all the Prefaces, and to give every  assistance in my power as Editress.    The Memorial Edition commences with the present \"Pilgrimage to  Al-Madinah and Meccah,\" which will be followed at intervals by others  of my husband's works. Since this \"Memorial Edition\" was arranged, and  the Prospectus issued, I have parted with the Copyright of my husband's  famous translation of the \"Arabian Nights\" to the Publishers, and they  are arranging to bring out that work at an early date, and as nearly as  possible uniform in appearance with the Memorial Edition.    The ornamentations on the binding are, a figure of my husband in his  Arab costume, his monogram in Arabic, and, on the back of the book, the  tent which is his tomb.    Both the publishers and myself have to thank Mr. Smithers for the  infinite trouble he has taken in collating the first, second, third and  fourth editions of the Pilgrimage' with Sir Richard's own original  annotated copies. All the lengthy notes and appendices of the first  edition have been retained, and these are supplemented by the notes and  appendices in the later editions, as well as by the author's MS. notes.  He has adopted Sir Richard's latest and    [p.xvii]most correct orthography of Arabic words, and has passed the  sheets through the press. Following my husband's plan in \"The Thousand  Nights and a Night,\" he has put the accents on Arabic words only the  first time of their appearance, to show how they ought to be; thinking  it unnecessary to preserve throughout, what is an eyesore to the reader  and a distress to the printer. So it is with Arabic books,-the accents  are only put for the early student; afterwards, they are left to the  practical knowledge of the reader. All the original coloured  illustrations of the first edition, and also the wood engravings of the  later issues, are reproduced for the first time in one uniform edition.  The map and plans are fac-similies of those in the latest (fourth)  edition. In fact, everything has been done to make this book worthy of  its author and of the public's appreciation.    For those who may not know the import of \"A Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah  and Meccah,\" in 1853, they will not take it amiss when I say that there  are Holy Shrines of the Moslem world in the far-away Desert, where no  white man, European, or Christian, could enter (save as a Moslem), or  even approach, without certain death. They are more jealously guarded  than the \"Holy Grail,\" and this Work narrates how this Pilgrimage was  accomplished. My husband had lived as a Dervish in Sind, which greatly  helped him; and he studied every separate thing until he was master of  it, even apprenticing himself to a blacksmith to learn how to make  horse-shoes and to shoe his own horses. It meant living with his life  in his hand, amongst the strangest and wildest companions, adopting  their unfamiliar manners, living for nine months in the hottest and  most unhealthy climate, upon    [p.xviii]repulsive food; it meant complete and absolute isolation from  everything that makes life tolerable, from all civilisation, from all  his natural habits; the brain at high tension, but the mind never  wavering from the role he had adopted; but he liked it, he was happy in  it, he felt at home in it, and in this Book he tells you how he did it,  and what he saw.    Sir Richard Burton died at the age of 70, on the 20th October, 1890.  During the last 48 years of his life, he lived only for the benefit and  for the welfare of England and of his countrymen, and of the Human Race  at large. Let us reverently raise up this \"Monument,\" aere perennius,  to his everlasting memory.    ISABEL BURTON.  May 24, 1893.    [p.xix]PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.    AFTER a lapse of twenty-five years, a third edition of my Pilgrimage  has been called for by the public, to whom I take this opportunity of  returning thanks. Messrs. Mullan have chosen the very best opportunity.  My two publications concerning the Khedival Expeditions to Midian (\"The  Gold Mines of Midian,\" and \"The Land of Midian Revisited\"), are, as I  have stated in the Preface, sequels and continuations of this  Pilgrimage from which the adventures forming their subject may be said  to date.    The text has been carefully revised, and the \"baggage of notes\" has  been materially lightened.[FN#1] From the Appendix I have removed  matter which, though useful to the student, is of scant general  interest. The quaint and interesting \"Narrative and Voyages of  Ludovicus Vertomannus, Gentleman of Rome,\" need no longer be read in  extracts, when the whole has been printed by the Hakluyt Society. (The  Travels of Ludovico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and  Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503 to 1508.  Translated from the original Italian edition of 1510, with a Preface by  John Winter Jones, Esq., F.S.A., and edited,    [p.xx]with notes and an Introduction, by George Percy Badger, late  Government Chaplain in the Presidency of Bombay. London.) On the other  hand, I have inserted after the Appendix, with the permission of the  author, two highly interesting communications from Dr. Aloys Sprenger,  the well-known Orientalist and Arabist, concerning the routes of the  Great Caravans. My friend supports his suspicions that an error of  direction has been made, and geographers will enjoy the benefit of his  conscientious studies, topographical and linguistic.    The truculent attacks made upon pilgrims and Darwayshes call for a few  words of notice. Even that learned and amiable philanthropist, the late  Dr. John Wilson of Bombay (\"Lands of the Bible,\" vol. ii., p. 302)  alludes, in the case of the Spaniard Badia, alias Ali Bey al-Abbasi, to  the \"unjustifiable fanciful disguise of a Mohammedan Pilgrim.\" The  author of the Ruddy Goose Theory (\"Voice of Israel from Mount Sinai\")  and compiler of the \"Historical Geography of Arabia\" has dealt a foul  blow to the memory of Burckhardt, the energetic and inoffensive Swiss  traveller, whose name has ever been held in the highest repute. And now  the \"Government Chaplain\" indites (Introduction, p. xxvii.) the  following invidious remarks touching the travels of Ludovico di  Varthema-the vir Deo carus, be it remarked, of the learned and laical  Julius Caesar Scaliger:    \"This is not the place to discuss the morality of an act involving the  deliberate and voluntary denial of what a man holds to be truth in a  matter so sacred as that of Religion. Such a violation of conscience is  not justifiable by the end which the renegade (!) may have in view,  however abstractedly praiseworthy it may be; and even granting that his  demerit should be gauged by the amount of knowledge which he possesses  of what is true and what false, the conclusion is inevitable, that  nothing short of utter ignorance of the precepts of his faith, or a    [p.xxi]conscientious disbelief in them, can fairly relieve the  Christian, who conforms to Islamism without a corresponding persuasion  of its verity, of the deserved odium all honest men attach to apostasy  and hypocrisy.\"    The reply to this tirade is simply, \"Judge not; especially when you are  ignorant of the case which you are judging.\" Perhaps also the writer  may ask himself, Is it right for those to cast stones who dwell in a  tenement not devoid of fragility?  The second attack proceeds from a place whence no man would reasonably  have expected it. The author of the \"Narrative of a Year's Journey  through Central and Eastern Arabia\" (vol. i., pp. 258-59) thus  expresses his opinions:-    \"Passing oneself off for a wandering Darweesh, as some European  explorers have attempted to do in the East, is for more reasons than  one a very bad plan. It is unnecessary to dilate on that moral aspect  of the proceeding which will always first strike"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#1)"],[1,"and proofread by William Thierens and Robert Sinton          PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF A PILGRIMAGE TO AL-MADINAH & MECCAH    BY    CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD F.

AL-MADINAH.  (Continued.)    [p.1]  A PILGRIMAGE    TO    AL-MADINAH AND MECCAH.    CHAPTER XXI.    THE PEOPLE OF AL-MADINAH.    AL-MADINAH contains but few families descended from the Prophets  Auxiliaries. I heard only of four whose genealogy is undoubted. These  were,    1. The Bayt al-Ansari, or descendants of Abu Ayyub, a most noble race  whose tree ramifies through a space of fifteen hundred years. They keep  the keys of the Kuba Mosque, and are Imams in the Harim, but the family  is no longer wealthy or powerful.    2. The Bayt Abu Jud: they supply the Harim with Imams and  Muezzins.[FN#l] I was told that there are now but two surviving members  of this family, a boy and a girl.    3. The Bayt al-Shaab, a numerous race. Some of the members travel  professionally, others trade, and others are employed in the Harim.    4. The Bayt al-Karrani, who are mostly engaged in commerce.    There is also a race called Al-Nakhawilah,[FN#2] who,    [p.2]according to some, are descendants of the Ansar, whilst others  derive them from Yazid, the son of Muawiyah: the latter opinion is  improbable, as the Caliph in question was a mortal foe to Alis family,  which is inordinately venerated by these people. As far as I could  ascertain, they abuse the Shaykhayn (Abu Bakr and Omar): all my  informants agreed upon this point, but none could tell me why they  neglected to bedevil Osman, the third object of hatred to the Shiah  persuasion. They are numerous and warlike, yet they are despised by the  townspeople, because they openly profess heresy, and are moreover of  humble degree. They have their own priests and instructors, although  subject to the orthodox Kazi; marry in their own sect, are confined to  low offices, such as slaughtering animals, sweeping, and gardening, and  are not allowed to enter the Harim during life, or to be carried to it  after death. Their corpses are taken down an outer street called the  Darb al-JanazahRoad of Biersto their own cemetery near Al-Bakia. They  dress and speak Arabic, like the townspeople; but the Arabs pretend to  distinguish them by a peculiar look denoting their degradation: it is  doubtless the mistake of effect for cause, about all such    Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast.   number of reports are current about the horrid    [p.3]customs of these people, and their community of women[FN#3] with  the Persian pilgrims who pass through the town. It need scarcely be  said that such tales coming from the mouths of fanatic foes are not to  be credited. I regret not having had an opportunity to become intimate  with any of the Nakhawilah, from whom curious information might be  elicited. Orthodox Moslems do not like to be questioned about such  hateful subjects; when I attempted to learn something from one of my  acquaintance, Shaykh Ula al-Din, of a Kurd family, settled at  Al-Madinah, a man who had travelled over the East, and who spoke five  languages to perfection, he coldly replied that he had never consorted  with these heretics. Sayyids and Sharifs,[FN#4] the descendants of the  Prophet, here abound. The Benu Hosayn of Al-Madinah have their  head-quarters at Suwayrkiyah:[FN#5] the former place contains six or  seven families; the latter, ninety-three or ninety-four. Anciently they  were much more numerous, and such was their power, that for centuries  they retained charge of the Prophets tomb. They    [p.4]subsist principally upon their Amlak, property in land, for which  they have title-deeds extending back to Mohammeds day, and Aukaf,  religious bequests; popular rumour accuses them of frequent murders for  the sake of succession. At Al-Madinah they live chiefly at the Hosh Ibn  Saad, a settlement outside the town and south of the Darb al-Janazah.  There is, however, no objection to their dwelling within the walls; and  they are taken to the Harim after death, if there be no evil report  against the individual. Their burial-place is the Bakia cemetery. The  reason of this toleration is, that some are supposed to be Sunni, or  orthodox, and even the most heretical keep their Rafz[FN#6] (heresy) a  profound secret. Most learned Arabs believe that they belong, like the  Persians, to the sect of Ali: the truth, however, is so vaguely known,  that I could find out none of the peculiarities of their faith, till I  met a Shirazi friend at Bombay. The Benu Hosayn are spare dark men of  Badawi appearance, and they dress in the old Arab style still affected  by the Sharifs,a Kufiyah (kerchief) on the head,[FN#7] and a Banish, a  long and wide-sleeved garment resembling our magicians gown, thrown over  the white cotton Kamis (shirt): in public they always carry swords,  even when others leave weapons at home. There are about two hundred  families of Sayyid Alawiyah,descendants of Ali by any of his wives but  Fatimah, they bear no distinctive mark in dress or appearance, and are  either employed at the    [p.5]temple or engage at trade. Of the Khalifiyah, or descendants of  Abbas, there is, I am told, but one household, the Bayt Al-Khalifah,  who act as Imams in the Harim, and have charge of Hamzahs tomb. Some  declare that there are a few of the Siddikiyah, or descendants from Abu  Bakr; others ignore them, and none could give me any information about  the Benu Najjar.    The rest of the population of Al-Madinah is a motley race composed of  offshoots from every nation in Al-Islam. The sanctity of the city  attracts strangers, who, purposing to stay but a short time, become  residents; after finding some employment, they marry, have families,  die, and are buried there with an eye to the spiritual advantages of  the place. I was much importuned to stay at Al-Madinah. The only known  physician was one Shaykh Abdullah Sahib, an Indian, a learned man, but  of so melancholic a temperament, and so ascetic in his habits, that his  knowledge was entirely lost to the public. Why dost thou not, said my  friends, hire a shop somewhere near the Prophets Mosque? There thou wilt  eat bread by thy skill, and thy soul will have the blessing of being on  holy ground. Shaykh Nur also opined after a short residence at  Al-Madinah that it was bara jannati Shahr, a very heavenly City, and  little would have induced him to make it his home. The present ruling  race at Al-Madinah, in consequence of political vicissitudes, is the  Sufat,[FN#8] sons of Turkish fathers by Arab mothers. These half-castes  are now numerous, and have managed to secure the highest and most  lucrative offices. Besides Turks, there are families originally from  the Maghrib, Takruris, Egyptians in considerable numbers, settlers from  Al-Yaman and other parts of Arabia, Syrians, Kurds, Afghans,  Daghistanis from the Caucasus, and a few JawisJava Moslems. The Sindis,  I was told, reckon about one hundred families, who are exceedingly  despised for their    [p.6]cowardice and want of manliness, whilst the Baluch and the Afghan  are respected. The Indians are not so numerous in proportion here as at  Meccah; still Hindustani is by no means uncommonly heard in the  streets. They preserve their peculiar costume, the women persisting in  showing their faces, and in wearing tight, exceedingly tight,  pantaloons. This, together with other reasons, secures for them the  contempt of the Arabs. At Al-Madinah they are generally small  shopkeepers, especially druggists and sellers of Kumash (cloth), and  they form a society of their own. The terrible cases of misery and  starvation which so commonly occur among the improvident Indians at  Jeddah and Meccah are here rare.    The Hanafi school holds the first rank at Al-Madinah, as in most parts  of Al-Islam, although many of the citizens, and almost all the Badawin,  are Shafeis. The reader will have remarked with astonishment that at one  of the fountain-heads of the faith, there are several races of  schismatics, the Benu Hosayn, the Benu Ali, and the Nakhawilah. At the  town of Safra there are said to be a number of the Zuyud  schismatics,[FN#9] who visit Al-Madinah, and have settled in force at  Meccah, and some declare that the Bayazi sect[FN#10] also exists.    The citizens of Al-Madinah are a favoured race, although the city is  not, like Meccah, the grand mart of the Moslem world or the  meeting-place of nations. They pay no taxes, and reject the idea of a  Miri, or land-cess, with extreme disdain. Are we, the children of the  Prophet, they exclaim, to support or to be supported? The Wahhabis, not  understanding the argument, taxed them,    [p.7]as was their wont, in specie and in materials, for which reason  the very name of those Puritans is an abomination. As has before been  shown, all the numerous attendants at the Mosque are paid partly by the  Sultan, partly by Aukaf, the rents of houses and lands bequeathed to  the shrine, and scattered over every part of the Moslem world. When a  Madani is inclined to travel, he applies to the Mudir al-Harim, and  receives from him a paper which entitles him to the receipt of a  considerable sum at Constantinople. The Ikram (honorarium), as it is  called, varies with the rank of the recipient, the citizens being  divided into these four orders, viz.    First and highest, the Sadat (Sayyids),[FN#11] and Ima[m]s, who are  entitled to twelve purses, or about £60. Of these there are said to be  three hundred families.  "]]]
