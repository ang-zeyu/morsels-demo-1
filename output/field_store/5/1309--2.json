Mime sits in front of the anvil, busily hammering      at a sword._    MIME            [_Who has been hammering with a small hammer, stops          working._        Slavery! worry!      Labour all lost!      The strongest sword      That ever I forged,      That the hands of giants      Fitly might wield,      This insolent urchin      For whom it is fashioned  Can snap in two at one stroke,  As if the thing were a toy!            [_Mime throws the sword on the anvil          ill-humouredly, and with his arms akimbo gazes          thoughtfully on the ground._        There is one sword      That he could not shatter:      Nothung's splinters      Would baffle his strength,      Could I but forge      Those doughty fragments      That all my skill      Cannot weld anew.  Could I but forge the weapon,  Shame and toil would win their reward!            [_He sinks further back his head bowed in thought._    Fafner, the dragon grim,  Dwells in the gloomy wood;  With his gruesome and grisly bulk      The Nibelung hoard      Yonder he guards.  Siegfried, lusty and young,  Would slay him without ado;      The Nibelung's ring      Would then become mine.  The only sword for the deed  Were Nothung, if it were swung  By Siegfried's conquering arm;      And I cannot fashion      Nothung, the sword!            [_He lays the sword in position again, and goes on          hammering in deep dejection._        Slavery! worry!      Labour all lost!      The strongest sword      That ever I forged      Will never serve      For that difficult deed.      I beat and I hammer      Only to humour the boy;  He snaps in two what I make,  And scolds if I cease from work.            [_He drops his hammer._    SIEGFRIED            [_In rough forester's dress, with a silver horn          hung by a chain, bursts in boisterously from the          wood. He is leading a big bear by a rope of bast,          and urges him towards Mime in wanton fun._        Hoiho! Hoiho!            [_Entering._        Come on! Come on!      Tear him! Tear him!      The silly smith!            [_Mime drops the sword in terror, and takes refuge          behind the forge; while Siegfried, shouting with          laughter, keeps driving the bear after him._    [Illustration: Mime at the anvil. See p. 2]    MIME        Hence with the beast!      I want not the bear!    SIEGFRIED        I come thus paired      The better to pinch thee;  Bruin, ask for the sword!    MIME        Hey! Let him go!      There lies the weapon;      It was finished to-day.    SIEGFRIED    Then thou art safe for to-day!            [_He lets the bear loose and strikes him on the          back with the rope._        Off, Bruin!      I need thee no more.            [_The bear runs back into the wood._    MIME [_Comes trembling from behind the forge._        Slay all the bears      Thou canst, and welcome;      But why thus bring the beasts      Home alive?    SIEGFRIED [_Sits down to recover from his laughter._    For better companions seeking  Than the one who sits at home,  I blew my horn in the wood,  Till the forest glades resounded.      What I asked with the note      Was if some good friend  My glad companion would be.  From the covert came a bear  Who listened to me with growls,  And I liked him better than thee,  Though better friends I shall find.      With a trusty rope      I bridled the beast,  To ask thee, rogue, for the weapon.            [_He jumps up and goes towards the anvil._    MIME            [_Takes up the sword to hand it to Siegfried._    I made the sword keen-edged;  In its sharpness thou wilt rejoice.            [_He holds the sword anxiously in his hand;          Siegfried snatches it from him._    What matters an edge keen sharpened,  Unless hard and true the steel?            [_Testing the sword._        Hei! What an idle,      Foolish toy!      Wouldst have this pin      Pass for a sword?            [_He strikes it on the anvil, so that the splinters          fly about. Mime shrinks back in terror._        There, take back the pieces,      Pitiful bungler!      'Tis on thy skull      It should have been broken!      Shall such a braggart      Still go on boasting,      Telling of giants      And prowess in battle,      Of deeds of valour,      And dauntless defence?--      A sword true and trusty      Try to forge me,      Praising the skill      He does not possess?      When I take hold      Of what he has hammered,      The rubbish crumbles      At a mere touch!      Were not the wretch      Too mean for my wrath,      I would break him in bits      As well as his work--  The doting fool of a gnome!--  And end the annoyance at once!            [_Siegfried throws himself on to a stone seat in a          rage. Mime all the time has been cautiously keeping          out of his way._    MIME        Again thou ravest like mad,      Ungrateful and perverse.      If what for him I forge      Is not perfect on the spot,      Too soon the boy forgets      The good things I have made!      Wilt never learn the lesson      Of gratitude, I wonder?      Thou shouldst be glad to obey him      Who always treated thee well.            [_Siegfried turns his back on Mime in a bad temper,          and sits with his face to the wall._    Thou dost not like to be told that!            [_He stands perplexed, then goes to the hearth in          the kitchen._    But thou wouldst fain be fed.  Wilt eat the meat I have roasted,  Or wouldst thou prefer the broth?  'Twas boiled solely for thee.            [_He brings food to Siegfried, who, without turning          round, knocks both bowl and meat out of his hand._    SIEGFRIED    Meat I roast for myself;  Sup thy filthy broth alone!    MIME [_In a wailing voice, as if hurt._        This is the reward      Of all my love!      All my care      Is paid for with scorn.      When thou wert a babe      I was thy nurse,      Made the mite clothing      To keep him warm,      Brought thee thy food,      Gave thee to drink,      Kept thee as safe      As I keep my skin;      And when thou wert grown      I waited on thee,      And made a bed      For thy slumber soft.      I fashioned thee toys      And a sounding horn,      Grudging no pains,      Wert thou but pleased.      With counsel wise      I guided thee well,      With mellow wisdom      Training thy mind.      Sitting at home,      I toil and moil;      To heart's desire      Wander thy feet.      Through thee alone worried,      And working for thee,      I wear myself out,      A poor old dwarf!            [_Sobbing._        And for my trouble      The sole reward is      By a hot-tempered boy            [_Sobbing._        To be hated and plagued!

When with my food      Or drink thou dost come,  I sup off loathing alone;      When thou dost softly      Make me a bed,  My sleep is broken and bad;      When thou wouldst teach me      How to be wise,  Fain were I deaf and dumb.      If my eyes happen      To fall on thee,      I find all thou doest      Amiss and ill-done;      When thou dost stand,      Waddle and walk,      Shamble and shuffle,      With thine eyelids blinking,      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],[0,"First Lensman (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note: Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.

The Patrol battle cruisers swerved to meet  them, and a miles-long cone of pure energy ravened out at the invaders,  destroying whatever it touched.    But the moment before the force beam struck, thousands of tiny objects  dropped from the enemy fleet and, faster than light, flashed straight  at their target--each one an atom bomb powerful enough to destroy  Patrol Headquarters by itself!    The Galactic Patrol--and civilization itself--had seconds to live.  Unless a miracle happened....    A LENSMAN ADVENTURE    _Second in the Great Series_          CHAPTER 1      The visitor, making his way unobserved through the crowded main  laboratory of The Hill, stepped up to within six feet of the back  of a big Norwegian seated at an electrono-optical bench. Drawing an  automatic pistol, he shot the apparently unsuspecting scientist seven  times, as fast as he could pull the trigger; twice through the brain,  five times, closely spaced, through the spine.    \"Ah, Gharlane of Eddore, I have been expecting you to look me up. Sit  down.\" Blonde, blue-eyed Dr. Nels Bergenholm, completely undisturbed by  the passage of the stream of bullets through his head and body, turned  and waved one huge hand at a stool beside his own.    \"But those were not ordinary projectiles!\" the visitor protested.  Neither person--or rather, entity--was in the least surprised that no  one else had paid any attention to what had happened, but it was clear  that the one was taken aback by the failure of his murderous attack.  \"They should have volatilized that form of flesh--should at least have  blown you back to Arisia, where you belong.\"    \"Ordinary or extraordinary, what matter? As you, in the guise of  Gray Roger, told Conway Costigan a short time since, 'I permitted  that, as a demonstration of futility.' Know, Gharlane, once and for  all, that you will no longer be allowed to act directly against any  adherent of Civilization, wherever situate. We of Arisia will not  interfere in person with your proposed conquest of the two galaxies  as you have planned it, since the stresses and conflicts involved are  necessary--and, I may add, sufficient--to produce the Civilization  which must and shall come into being. Therefore, neither will you, or  any other Eddorian, so interfere. You will go back to Eddore and you  will stay there.\"    \"Think you so?\" Gharlane sneered. \"You, who have been so afraid of us  for over two thousand million Tellurian years that you dared not let us  even learn of you? So afraid of us that you dared not take any action  to avert the destruction of any one of your budding Civilizations upon  any one of the worlds of either galaxy? So afraid that you dare not,  even now, meet me mind to mind, but insist upon the use of this slow  and unsatisfactory oral communication between us?\"    \"Either your thinking is loose, confused, and turbid, which I do not  believe to be the case, or you are trying to lull me into believing  that you are stupid.\" Bergenholm's voice was calm, unmoved. \"I do not  _think_ that you will go back to Eddore; I know it. You, too, as soon  as you have become informed upon certain matters, will know it. You  protest against the use of spoken language because it is, as you know,  the easiest, simplest, and surest way of preventing you from securing  any iota of the knowledge for which you are so desperately searching.  As to a meeting of our two minds, they met fully just before you,  operating as Gray Roger, remembered that which your entire race forgot  long ago. As a consequence of that meeting I so learned every line  and vibration of your life pattern as to be able to greet you by your  symbol, Gharlane of Eddore, whereas you know nothing of me save that I  am an Arisian, a fact which has been obvious from the first.\"    In an attempt to create a diversion, Gharlane released the zone of  compulsion which he had been holding; but the Arisian took it over so  smoothly that no human being within range was conscious of any change.    \"It is true that for many cycles of time we concealed our existence  from you,\" Bergenholm went on without a break. \"Since the reason for  that concealment will still further confuse you, I will tell you what  it was. Had you Eddorians learned of us sooner you might have been able  to forge a weapon of power sufficient to prevent the accomplishment of  an end which is now certain.    \"It is true that your operations as Lo Sung of Uighar were not  constrained. As Mithridates of Pontus--as Sulla, Marius, and Nero of  Rome--as Hannibal of Carthage--as those self-effacing wights Alcixerxes  of Greece and Menocoptes of Egypt--as Genghis Khan and Attila and  the Kaiser and Mussolini and Hitler and the Tyrant of Asia--you were  allowed to do as you pleased. Similar activities upon Rigel Four,  Velantia, Palain Seven, and elsewhere were also allowed to proceed  without effective opposition. With the appearance of Virgil Samms,  however, the time arrived to put an end to your customary pernicious,  obstructive, and destructive activities. I therefore interposed a  barrier between you and those who would otherwise be completely  defenseless against you.\"    \"But why now? Why not thousands of cycles ago? And why Virgil Samms?\"    \"To answer those questions would be to give you valuable data. You  may--too late--be able to answer them yourself. But to continue: you  accuse me, and all Arisia, of cowardice; an evidently muddy and inept  thought. Reflect, please, upon the completeness of your failure in the  affair of Roger's planetoid; upon the fact that you have accomplished  nothing whatever since that time; upon the situation in which you now  find yourself.    \"Even though the trend of thought of your race is basically  materialistic and mechanistic, and you belittle ours as being  'philosophic' and 'impractical', you found--much to your surprise--that  your most destructive physical agencies are not able to affect even  this form of flesh which I am now energizing, to say nothing of  affecting the reality which is I.    \"If this episode is the result of the customary thinking of the  second-in-command of Eddore's Innermost Circle ... but no, my  visualization cannot be that badly at fault. Overconfidence--the  tyrant's innate proclivity to underestimate an opponent--these things  have put you into a false position; but I greatly fear that they will  not operate to do so in any really important future affair.\"    \"Rest assured that they will not!\" Gharlane snarled. \"It may not  be--exactly--cowardice. It is, however, something closely akin. If you  could have acted effectively against us at any time in the past, you  would have done so. If you could act effectively against us now, you  would be acting, not talking. That is elementary--self-evidently true.  So true that you have not tried to deny it--nor would you expect me to  believe you if you did.\" Cold black eyes stared level into icy eyes of  Norwegian blue.    \"Deny it? No. I am glad, however, that you used the word 'effectively'  instead of 'openly'; for we have been acting effectively against you  ever since these newly-formed planets cooled sufficiently to permit of  the development of intelligent life.\"    \"What? You have? How?\"    \"That, too, you may learn--too late. I have now said all I intend  to say. I will give you no more information. Since you already know  that there are more adult Arisians than there are Eddorians, so that  at least one of us can devote his full attention to blocking the  direct effort of any one of you, it is clear to you that it makes no  difference to me whether you elect to go or to stay. I can and I will  remain here as long as you do; I can and I will accompany you whenever  you venture out of the volume of space protected by Eddorian screen,  wherever you go. The election is yours.\"    Gharlane disappeared. So did the Arisian--instantaneously. Dr. Nels  Bergenholm, however, remained. Turning, he resumed his work where he  had left off, knowing exactly what he had been doing and exactly what  he was going to do to finish it. He released the zone of compulsion,  which he had been holding upon every human being within sight or  hearing, so dexterously that no one suspected, then or ever, that  anything out of the ordinary had happened. He knew these things and  did these things in spite of the fact that the form of flesh which his  fellows of the Triplanetary Service knew as Nels Bergenholm was then  being energized, not by the stupendously powerful mind of Drounli the  Molder, but by an Arisian child too young to be of any use in that  which was about to occur.    Arisia was ready. Every Arisian mind capable of adult, or of even  near-adult thinking was poised to act when the moment of action should  come. They were not, however, tense. While not in any sense routine,  that"]]]
