Book 03        Leviticus    03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the             tabernacle of the congregation, saying,    03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any             man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring             your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the             flock.    03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him             offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own             voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the             congregation before the LORD.    03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;             and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.    03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the             priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the             blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the             tabernacle of the congregation.    03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his             pieces.    03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the             altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:    03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,             and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which             is upon the altar:    03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the             priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,             an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or             of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male             without blemish.    03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before             the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his             blood round about upon the altar.    03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his             fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that             is on the fire which is upon the altar:    03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the             priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a             burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour             unto the LORD.    03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of             fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of             young pigeons.    03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off             his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof             shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:    03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast             it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the             ashes:    03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not             divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the             altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt             sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto             the LORD.    03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his             offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon             it, and put frankincense thereon:    03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he             shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of             the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the             priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an             offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:    03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his             sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD             made by fire.    03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the             oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with             oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.    03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it             shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.    03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a             meat offering.    03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,             it shall be made of fine flour with oil.    03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these             things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the             priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.    03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial             thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering             made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's             and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the             LORD made by fire.    03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be             made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,             in any offering of the LORD made by fire.    03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them             unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a             sweet savour.    03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with             salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of             thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine             offerings thou shalt offer salt.    03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the             LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy             firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn             beaten out of full ears.    03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:             it is a meat offering.    03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the             beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the             frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the             LORD.    03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he             offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall             offer it without blemish before the LORD.    03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and             kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and             Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the             altar round about.    03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an             offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the             inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,    03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by             the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it             shall he take away.    03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt             sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is             an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the             LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it             without blemish.    03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it             before the LORD.    03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and             kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's             sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the             altar.    03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an             offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the             whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the             fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon             the inwards,    03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is             by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,             it shall he take away.    03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of             the offering made by fire unto the LORD.    03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before             the LORD.    03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it             before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of             Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round             about.    03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made             by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and             all the fat that is upon the inwards,    03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is             by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,             it shall he take away.    03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food             of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat             is the LORD's.    03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations             throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor             blood.    03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8010"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 10: 2 Samuel (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by David Widger  with the help of Derek Andrew's text from January 1992  and the work of Bryan Taylor in November 2002.          Book 10        2 Samuel    10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was             returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had             abode two days in Ziklag;    10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man             came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and             earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,             that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.    10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said             unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.    10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,             tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the             battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and             Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.    10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest             thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?    10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance             upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,             lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.    10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.             And I answered, Here am I.    10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an             Amalekite.    10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay             me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole             in me.    10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he             could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown             that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,             and have brought them hither unto my lord.    10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and             likewise all the men that were with him:    10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,             and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and             for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the             sword.    10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art             thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an             Amalekite.    10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch             forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?    10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and             fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.    10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy             mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the             LORD's anointed.    10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over             Jonathan his son:    10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the             bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)    10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are             the mighty fallen!    10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;             lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the             daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.    10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there             be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the             shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,             as though he had not been anointed with oil.    10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the             bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul             returned not empty.    10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and             in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than             eagles, they were stronger than lions.    10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in             scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold             upon your apparel.    10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O             Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.    10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant             hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing             the love of women.    10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!    10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the             LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?             And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither             shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.    10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the             Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.    10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man             with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.    10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king             over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the             men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.    10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and             said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed             this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried             him.    10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also             will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this             thing.    10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye             valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of             Judah have anointed me king over them.    10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took             Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;    10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and             over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over             all Israel.    10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to             reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of             Judah followed David.    10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of             Judah was seven years and six months.    10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the             son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.    10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went             out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat             down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on             the other side of the pool.    10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play             before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.    10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,             which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of             the servants of David.    10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust             his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:             wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in             Gibeon.    10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was             beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.    10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,             and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.    10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to             the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.    10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And             he answered, I am.    10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to             thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take             thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from             following of him.    10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following             me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then             should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?    10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the             hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that             the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and             died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as             came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.    10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went             down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth             before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.    10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together             after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an             hill.    10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour             for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the             latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people             return from following their brethren?    10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely             then in the morning the people had gone up every one from             following his brother.    10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and             pursued after Israel no"]]]
