The scene was in Bauton, a large manufacturing city of New England. The  first speaker was a workman at the shops that had been mentioned, but  beyond the fact that he placed the youth before him in the way of getting  work, he needs no special introduction.    The other person was a lad of eighteen, with brown, curly hair, blue eyes,  and a round, robust figure. His name was John North, and he was the son of  a couple in humble circumstances.    \"Take care!\" cried the man, \"that sneak will get in ahead of you, and then  a snap of your little finger for your chance of getting the job at  Fowler's.\"    Jack North did not stop to hear his friend through. He was very much in  need of a situation, and he knew the young man who had rushed in ahead of  him as a bitter enemy. That fact, coupled with his desire to get work,  caused him to dash up the street as fast as he could run.    Naturally the appearance of the two running at such a headlong pace  aroused the attention of the passers-by, all of whom stopped to see what  it meant. Others rushed out of their houses, offices or workshops to  ascertain the meaning of the race, until the street was lined with  excited, anxious men, women and children.    \"Is it fire?\" asked an old, gray-headed man, and another, catching only  the sound of the last word, repeated it and thus a wild alarm was quickly  spread.    Meanwhile Jack North had found that he could not overtake his rival. He  was not a fleet runner, while the other had gotten a start of him, which  he could not hope to make up.    But he was too fertile in his resources to despair. In fact he was never  known to give up a contest which he had once fairly entered. This  persistence in whatever he undertook was the secret of Jack North's  wonderful success amid environments which must have discouraged less  courageous hearts.    Still it looked to his enemy, as the latter glanced back to see him  leisurely turn into a side street leading away from their destination,  that he had nothing further to fear from him.    \"Thought you would be glad to give in,\" cried out the delighted seeker of  the situation at the engine shops, and believing that he had nothing  further to fear, the awkward youth slackened his gait to a walk.    Though Jack turned into the alley at a moderate pace, as soon as he had  gone a short distance, he started again into a smart run.    \"I shall have farther to go,\" he thought, \"but Fret Offut will think I  have given up, and thus he will let me get in ahead of him.\"    This seemed the truth, when, at last, Jack came in sight of the low-walled  and scattering buildings belonging to John Fowler & Co., engine builders.    Fret Offut was nowhere in sight, as Jack entered the dark, dingy office at  the lower end of the buildings.    A small sized man, with mutton chop side whiskers, engaged in overhauling  a pile of musty papers, looked up at the entrance of our hero.    \"Want a job as striker, eh?\" he asked, as Jack stated his errand. \"I  believe Henshaw does want another man. I will call him. What is your  name?\"    \"Alfret Offut, sir. It's me that wants the job, and it's me it belongs  to.\"    It was Jack North's enemy who spoke, as he paused on the threshold panting  for breath, while glaring at our hero with a baleful look.    \"How come you here?\" he demanded of Jack, a second later.    \"My feet brought me here, and with less slowness than yours, judging by  your appearance,\" replied young North.    With the arrival of the second person on the scene, the clerk had turned  away to find Henshaw, and while he was gone the rival youths stood glaring  upon each other.    After a short time a big, red-faced, soot-be-grimed man appeared, saying  as he reached them:    \"If Offut will come this way I will talk with him.\"    \"Henshaw,\" said the clerk simply, returning to his work, leaving the  newcomer to attend to the visitors as he thought best.    \"Ha--ha!\" laughed young Offut, softly, as he followed the foreman, \"where  are you now, Jack North?\"    Though Jack gave slight token of his feelings, he was more vexed at this  usurpation of his rights than he cared to show. He lost no time in  starting after the others in the direction of the shop. \"I'm going on  twenty-one,\" Offut said, as they stopped at the door, \"and there ain't a  chap as can outlift me.\"    \"Beg your pardon, Mr. Henshaw,\" said Jack, brushing up, \"but it's I who am  after the job and to whom it belongs. Mr. Jacobs--\"    \"Is your name Alfret Offut?\" interrupted the other youth sharply in the  midst of Jack's speech. \"I reckon Henshaw knows who he is talking to.\" \"It  was me Mr. Jacobs recommended the place to, and you are trying to steal it  from me,\" cried Jack. \"You are telling a likely story, Jack North, and if  you say another word I'll hit you. Henshaw called for me, and it's me he's  going to give work.\"    Mr. Henshaw, who for the first time seemed to realize the situation,  looked surprised, as he gazed from one to the other.    Disliking to raise a fuss Jack remained silent at first, but he felt bound  to say:    \"I was first at the office, and I claim--\" \"You'd claim the earth, as far  as that is concerned, you miserable chick of nobody!\" broke in Offut.    The last was more than Jack could stand, and stepping quickly forward, he  cried: \"Stop, Fret Offut! you have said enough. I don't want any quarrel  with you, but I am as good as you.\"    \"Are yer?\" demanded the fiery Offut, whose greatest delight seemed to be  in provoking a quarrel. \"I can lick you out of your boots, and I will do  it before I will let you get in here.\" By this time Mr. Henshaw, a rather  rough man, as slow as he was of comprehension, was interested in the  dispute, and not averse to encouraging sport of the kind, he said:    \"That's it, boys; fight it out. I'll hire the lad that downs the other.\"    \"Then the job is as good as mine!\" cried Fret Offut, rushing at Jack with  great bluster and no regard to fairness.          Chapter II    The Test of Strength        If taken unawares, Jack North did not allow his enemy to get very much the  advantage of him. As the other rushed forward, expecting to overpower him  by sheer force, he met him squarely in a hand-to-hand struggle for the  mastery.    Mr. Henshaw seemed delighted, and he cried out:    \"Limber up, lads, limber up! A job to him that comes out on top! Hi,  there!\"    Sundry other exclamations came from the excited foreman at every change of  the situation, while several spectators, attracted to the place by the  out-cries, gathered about the young contestants, lending their voices to  the confusing sounds of the scene.    While Fret Offut was taller and larger than Jack North, he lacked the  latter's firm-set muscles, and what was of even greater account, his  unflinching determination to win. Our hero never knew what it was to  possess a faint heart, and that is more than half the battle every time.    Thus when young Offut crowded him back against the wall of the building,  and every one present felt sure he must be overpowered, Jack set his lips  more firmly together and renewed his resistance with redoubled effort.    Then, as he struck his foot against a piece of scrap iron and reeled  backward in spite of all he could, his friends groaned, while Fret Offut  cried, exultantly:    \"Ho, my fine cub, down you go this time! Henshaw--\"    But Mr. Henshaw never knew what was to be said to him, neither did the  young bully ever realize fully just what followed.    Jack, concentrating all the strength he possessed, rallied. He threw out  his right foot in such a way as to catch his antagonist behind his left  knee, when the latter suddenly found himself sinking. At the same time the  grasp on his collar tightened, while with almost superhuman power he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#1)"],[1,"Trial  Franz Kafka    Translation Copyright (C) by David Wyllie  Translator contact email: dandelion@post.cz          Chapter One  Arrest - Conversation with Mrs. Grubach - Then Miss Buerstner            Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had  done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested.  Every day at  eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by  Mrs. Grubach's  cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come.  That  had never happened before.  K. waited a little while, looked from his  pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with  an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and  disconcerted, rang the bell.  There was immediately a knock at the door  and a man entered.  He had never seen the man in this house before.  He  was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting,  with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of  which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it  very clear what they were actually for.  \"Who are you?\" asked K.,  sitting half upright in his bed.  The man, however, ignored the question  as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, \"You  rang?\"  \"Anna should have brought me my breakfast,\" said K.  He tried to  work out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through  observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to  be looked at for very long.  Instead he went over to the door, opened it  slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately  behind it, \"He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast.\"  There was a  little laughter in the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the  sound of it whether there were several people laughing.  The strange man  could not have learned anything from it that he hadn't known already,  but now he said to K., as if making his report \"It is not possible.\"  \"It would be the first time that's happened,\" said K., as he jumped out  of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers.  \"I want to see who that is  in the next room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be  disturbed in this way.\"  It immediately occurred to him that he needn't  have said this out loud, and that he must to some extent have  acknowledged their authority by doing so, but that didn't seem important  to him at the time.  That, at least, is how the stranger took it, as he  said, \"Don't you think you'd better stay where you are?\"  \"I want  neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you've introduced  yourself.\"  \"I meant it for your own good,\" said the stranger and opened  the door, this time without being asked.  The next room, which K.  entered more slowly than he had intended, looked at first glance exactly  the same as it had the previous evening.  It was Mrs. Grubach's living  room, over-filled with furniture, tablecloths, porcelain and  photographs.  Perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual  today, but if so it was not immediately obvious, especially as the main  difference was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a  book from which he now looked up.  \"You should have stayed in your room!  Didn't Franz tell you?\"  \"And what is it you want, then?\" said K.,  looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named  Franz, who had remained in the doorway.  Through the open window he  noticed the old woman again, who had come close to the window opposite  so that she could continue to see everything.  She was showing an  inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was going senile. \"I  want to see Mrs. Grubach ...,\" said K., making a movement as if tearing  himself away from the two men - even though they were standing well away  from him - and wanted to go.  \"No,\" said the man at the window, who  threw his book down on a coffee table and stood up.  \"You can't go away  when you're under arrest.\"  \"That's how it seems,\" said K.  \"And why am  I under arrest?\" he then asked.  \"That's something we're not allowed to  tell you.  Go into your room and wait there.  Proceedings are underway  and you'll learn about everything all in good time.  It's not really  part of my job to be friendly towards you like this, but I hope no-one,  apart from Franz, will hear about it, and he's been more friendly  towards you than he should have been, under the rules, himself.  If you  carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting  officers then you can reckon on things going well with you.\"  K. wanted  to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from the chair by the window,  there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit.  \"You'll get  the chance to see for yourself how true all this is,\" said Franz and  both men then walked up to K.  They were significantly bigger than him,  especially the second man, who frequently slapped him on the shoulder.  The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and said he would now have to wear  one that was of much lower quality, but that they would keep the  nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if  his case turned out well.  \"It's better for you if you give us the  things than if you leave them in the storeroom,\" they said.  \"Things  have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain  amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come  to an end or not.  And cases like this can last a long time, especially  the ones that have been coming up lately.  They'd give you the money  they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what they're  offered for them when they sell them that counts, it's how much they get  slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value anyway when  they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year.\"  K. paid hardly  any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on  what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to  them.  It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of  his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were  here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen -  looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up  and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.   His  strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and sharing an  understanding with the other policeman.  What sort of people were these?  What were they talking about?  What office did they belong to?  K. was  living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace, all laws  were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in his own  home?  He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could, to  cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the future, even  when everything seemed under threat.  But here that did not seem the  right thing to do.  He could have taken it all as a joke, a big joke set  up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or also  perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all possible of  course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's face in some  way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were tradesmen from the  corner of the street, they looked like they might be - but he was  nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight of the one  called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over  these people.  There was a very slight risk that people would later say  he couldn't understand a joke, but - although he wasn't normally in the  habit of learning from experience - he might also have had a few  unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious friends, he  had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and had been made  to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not this time at  least; if they were play-acting he would act along with them.            He still had time.  \"Allow me,\" he said, and hurried between the  two policemen through into his room.  \"He seems sensible enough,\" he  heard them say behind him.  Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the  drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his  agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was  looking for straight away.  He finally found his bicycle permit and was  about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too  petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate.  Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side  opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter.  He only saw her for an  instant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed,  asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very  carefully.  \"Do come in,\" K. could have said just then. But now he stood  in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking  at the door which did not open again.  He stayed like that until he was  startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little  table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast.  \"Why didn't she come in?\" he asked.  \"She's not allowed to,\" said the  big policeman.  \"You're under arrest, aren't you.\"  \"But how can I be  under arrest? And how come it's like this?\"  \"Now you're starting  again,\" said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the  honeypot.  \"We don't answer questions like that.\"  \"You will have to  answer them,\" said K.  \"Here are my identification papers, now show me  yours and I certainly want to see the arrest warrant.\"  \"Oh, my God!\"  said the policeman.  \"In a position like yours, and you think you can  start giving orders, do you?  It won't do you any good to get us on the  wrong side, even if you think it will - we're probably more on your side  that anyone else you know!\"  \"Th"]]]
