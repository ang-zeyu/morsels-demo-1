Scholar of Gonville and Caius College    ONE OF THE SURVIVORS        PREFACE    The circumstances in which this book came to be written are as  follows. Some five weeks after the survivors from the Titanic landed  in New York, I was the guest at luncheon of Hon. Samuel J. Elder and  Hon. Charles T. Gallagher, both well-known lawyers in Boston. After  luncheon I was asked to relate to those present the experiences of the  survivors in leaving the Titanic and reaching the Carpathia.    When I had done so, Mr. Robert Lincoln O'Brien, the editor of the  _Boston Herald_, urged me as a matter of public interest to write  a correct history of the Titanic disaster, his reason being that he  knew several publications were in preparation by people who had not  been present at the disaster, but from newspaper accounts were piecing  together a description of it. He said that these publications would  probably be erroneous, full of highly coloured details, and generally  calculated to disturb public thought on the matter. He was supported  in his request by all present, and under this general pressure I  accompanied him to Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company, where we  discussed the question of publication.    Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company took at that time exactly the same  view that I did, that it was probably not advisable to put on record  the incidents connected with the Titanic's sinking: it seemed better  to forget details as rapidly as possible.    However, we decided to take a few days to think about it. At our next  meeting we found ourselves in agreement again,--but this time on the  common ground that it would probably be a wise thing to write a  history of the Titanic disaster as correctly as possible. I was  supported in this decision by the fact that a short account, which I  wrote at intervals on board the Carpathia, in the hope that it would  calm public opinion by stating the truth of what happened as nearly as  I could recollect it, appeared in all the American, English, and  Colonial papers and had exactly the effect it was intended to have.  This encourages me to hope that the effect of this work will be the  same.    Another matter aided me in coming to a decision,--the duty that we, as  survivors of the disaster, owe to those who went down with the ship,  to see that the reforms so urgently needed are not allowed to be  forgotten.    Whoever reads the account of the cries that came to us afloat on the  sea from those sinking in the ice-cold water must remember that they  were addressed to him just as much as to those who heard them, and  that the duty, of seeing that reforms are carried out devolves on  every one who knows that such cries were heard in utter helplessness  the night the Titanic sank.

CHAPTER I    CONSTRUCTION AND PREPARATIONS FOR THE FIRST VOYAGE      The history of the R.M.S. Titanic, of the White Star Line, is one of  the most tragically short it is possible to conceive. The world had  waited expectantly for its launching and again for its sailing; had  read accounts of its tremendous size and its unexampled completeness  and luxury; had felt it a matter of the greatest satisfaction that  such a comfortable, and above all such a safe boat had been designed  and built--the \"unsinkable lifeboat\";--and then in a moment to hear  that it had gone to the bottom as if it had been the veriest tramp  steamer of a few hundred tons; and with it fifteen hundred passengers,  some of them known the world over! The improbability of such a thing  ever happening was what staggered humanity.    If its history had to be written in a single paragraph it would be  somewhat as follows:--    \"The R.M.S. Titanic was built by Messrs. Harland & Wolff at their  well-known ship-building works at Queen's Island, Belfast, side by  side with her sister ship the Olympic. The twin vessels marked such an  increase in size that specially laid-out joiner and boiler shops were  prepared to aid in their construction, and the space usually taken up  by three building slips was given up to them. The keel of the Titanic  was laid on March 31, 1909, and she was launched on May 31, 1911; she  passed her trials before the Board of Trade officials on March 31,  1912, at Belfast, arrived at Southampton on April 4, and sailed the  following Wednesday, April 10, with 2208 passengers and crew, on her  maiden voyage to New York. She called at Cherbourg the same day,  Queenstown Thursday, and left for New York in the afternoon, expecting  to arrive the following Wednesday morning. But the voyage was never  completed. She collided with an iceberg on Sunday at 11.45 P.M. in  Lat. 41 deg. 46' N. and Long. 50 deg. 14' W., and sank two hours and a half  later; 815 of her passengers and 688 of her crew were drowned and 705  rescued by the Carpathia.\"    Such is the record of the Titanic, the largest ship the world had ever  seen--she was three inches longer than the Olympic and one thousand  tons more in gross tonnage--and her end was the greatest maritime  disaster known. The whole civilized world was stirred to its depths  when the full extent of loss of life was learned, and it has not yet  recovered from the shock. And that is without doubt a good thing. It  should not recover from it until the possibility of such a disaster  occurring again has been utterly removed from human society, whether  by separate legislation in different countries or by international  agreement. No living person should seek to dwell in thought for one  moment on such a disaster except in the endeavour to glean from it  knowledge that will be of profit to the whole world in the future.  When such knowledge is practically applied in the construction,  equipment, and navigation of passenger steamers--and not until  then--will be the time to cease to think of the Titanic disaster and  of the hundreds of men and women so needlessly sacrificed.    A few words on the ship's construction and equipment will be necessary  in order to make clear many points that arise in the course of this  book. A few figures have been added which it is hoped will help the  reader to follow events more closely than he otherwise could.    The considerations that inspired the builders to design the Titanic on  the lines on which she was constructed were those of speed, weight of  displacement, passenger and cargo accommodation. High speed is very  expensive, because the initial cost of the necessary powerful  machinery is enormous, the running expenses entailed very heavy, and  passenger and cargo accommodation have to be fined down to make the  resistance through the water as little as possible and to keep the  weight down. An increase in size brings a builder at once into  conflict with the question of dock and harbour accommodation at the  ports she will touch: if her total displacement is very great while  the lines are kept slender for speed, the draught limit may be  exceeded. The Titanic, therefore, was built on broader lines than the  ocean racers, increasing the total displacement; but because of the  broader build, she was able to keep within the draught limit at each  port she visited. At the same time she was able to accommodate more  passengers and cargo, and thereby increase largely her earning  capacity. A comparison between the Mauretania and the Titanic  illustrates the difference in these respects:--                    Displacement  Horse power  Speed in knots    Mauretania     44,640       70,000           26    Titanic        60,000       46,000           21    The vessel when completed was 883 feet long, 92 1/2 feet broad; her  height from keel to bridge was 104 feet. She had 8 steel decks, a  cellular double bottom, 5 1/4 feet through (the inner and outer  \"skins\" so-called), and with bilge keels projecting 2 feet for 300  feet of her length amidships. These latter were intended to lessen the  tendency to roll in a sea; they no doubt did so very well, but, as it  happened, they proved to be a weakness, for this was the first portion  of the ship touched by the iceberg and it has been suggested that the  keels were forced inwards by the collision and made the work of  smashing in the two \"skins\" a more simple matter. Not that the final  result would have been any different.    Her machinery was an expression of the latest progress in marine  engineering, being a combination of reciprocating engines with  Parsons's low-pressure turbine engine,--a combination which gives  increased power with the same steam consumption, an advance on the use  of reciprocating engines alone. The reciprocating engines drove the  wing-propellers and the turbine a mid-propeller, making her a  triple-screw vessel. To drive these engines she had 29 enormous  boilers and 159 furnaces.

SEVENTY-FIVE RECEIPTS FOR  PASTRY CAKES, AND SWEETMEATS    BY MISS LESLIE, OF PHILADELPHIA.    1832        PREFACE.    The following Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats, are  original, and have been used by the author and many of her friends  with uniform success. They are drawn up in a style so plain and  minute, as to be perfectly intelligible to servants, and persons  of the most moderate capacity. All the ingredients, with their  proper quantities, are enumerated in a list at the head of each  receipt, a plan which will greatly facilitate the business of  procuring and preparing the requisite articles.    There is frequently much difficulty in following directions in  English and French Cookery Books, not only from their want of  explicitness, but from the difference in the fuel, fire-places,  and cooking utensils, generally used in Europe and America; and  many of the European receipts are, so complicated and laborious,  that our female cooks are afraid to undertake the arduous task of  making any thing from them.    The receipts in this little book are, in every sense of the word,  American; but the writer flatters herself that (if exactly  followed) the articles produced from them will not be found  inferior to any of a similar description made in the European  manner. Experience has proved, that pastry, cakes, &c. prepared  _precisely_ according to these directions will not fail to be  excellent: but where economy is expedient, a portion of the  seasoning, that is, the spice, wine, brandy, rosewater, essence of  lemon, &c. may be omitted without any essential deviation of  flavour, or difference of appearance; retaining, however, the  given proportions of eggs, butter, sugar, and flour.    But if done at home, and by a person that can be trusted, it will  be proved, on trial, that any of these articles may be made in the  best and most liberal manner at _one half_ of the cost of the  same articles supplied by a confectioner. And they will be found  particularly useful to families that live in the country or in  small towns, where nothing of the kind is to be purchased.          CONTENTS.    PART THE FIRST.

Miscellaneous Receipts        As all families are not provided with scales and weights,  referring to the ingredients generally used in cakes and pastry,  we subjoin a list of weights and measures.      WEIGHT AND MEASURE    Wheat flour           one pound is                    one quart.  Indian meal           one pound, two ounces, is       one quart.  Butter--when soft     one pound is                    one quart.  Loaf-sugar, broken    one pound is                    one quart.  White sugar, powdered one pound, one ounce, is        one quart.  Eggs                  ten eggs are                    one pound.      LIQUID MEASURE    Sixteen large table-spoonfuls are                     half a pint.  Eight large table-spoonfuls are                       one gill.  Four large table-spoonfuls are                        half a gill.    A common-sized tumbler holds                          half a pint.  A common-sized wine-glass                             half a gill.      Allowing for accidental differences in the quality, freshness,  dryness, and moisture of the articles, we believe this comparison  between weight and measure, to be nearly correct as possible.          PART THE FIRST.    PASTRY      The eggs should not be beaten till after all the other ingredients  are ready, as they will fail very soon. If the whites and yolks  are to be beaten separately, do the whites first, as they will  stand longer.    Eggs should be beaten in a broad shallow pan, spreading wide at  the top. Butter and sugar should be stirred in a deep pan with  straight sides.    Break every egg by itself, in a saucer, before you put it into the  pan, that in case there should be any bad ones, they may not spoil  the others.    Eggs are beaten most expeditiously with rods. A small quantity of  white of egg may be beaten with a knife, or a three-pronged fork.      There can be no positive rules as to the exact time of baking each  article. Skill in baking is the result of practice, attention, and  experience. Much, of course, depends on the state of the fire, and  on the size of the things to be baked, and something on the  thickness of the pans or dishes.    If you bake in a stove, put some bricks in the oven part to set  the pans or plates on, and to temper the heat at the bottom. Large  sheets of iron, without sides, will be found very useful for small  cakes, and to put under the pans or plates.      PUFF PASTE.      Half a pound and two ounces of sifted flour.    Half a pound of the best fresh butter--washed.    A little cold water.    _This will make puff-paste for two Puddings, or for one  soup-plate Pie, or for four small Shells_.    Weigh half a pound and two ounces of flour, and sift it through a  hair-sieve into a large deep dish. Take out about one fourth of  the flour, and lay it aside on one corner of your pasteboard, to  roll and sprinkle with.    Wash, in cold water, half a pound of the best fresh butter.  Squeeze it hard with your hands and make it up into a round lump.  Divide it in four equal parts; lay them on one side of your  paste-board, and have ready a glass of cold water.    Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan of flour. Cut it  as small as possible. Wet it gradually with a very little water  (too much water will make it tough) and mix it well with the point  of a large case-knife. Do not touch it with your hands. When the  dough gets into a lump, sprinkle on the middle of the board some  of the flour that you laid aside, and lay the dough upon it,  turning it out of the pan with the knife.    Rub the rolling-pin with flour, and sprinkle a little on the lump  of paste. Roll it out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing on the  rolling-pin very lightly. Then take the second of the four pieces  of butter, and, with the point of your knife, stick it in little  bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. Sprinkle on  some flour, and fold up the dough. Flour the paste-board and  rolling-pin again; throw a little flour on the paste and roll it  out a second time. Stick the third piece of butter all over it in  little bits. Throw on some flour, fold up the paste, sprinkle a  little more flour on the dough, and on the rolling-pin, and roll  it out a third time, always pressing on it lightly. Stick it over  with the fourth and last piece of butter. Throw on a little more  flour, fold up the paste and then roll it out in a large round  sheet. Cut off the sides, so as to make the sheet of a square  form, and lay the slips of dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up  with the small pieces of trimmings, in the inside. Score or notch  it a little with the knife; lay it on a plate and set it away in a  cool place, but not where it can freeze, as that will make it  heavy.    Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pudding or pie. When  the mixture is finished, bring out your paste, flour the board and  rolling-pin, and roll it out with a short quick stroke, and  pressing the rolling-pin rather harder than while you were putting  the butter in. If the paste rises in blisters, it will be light,  unless spoiled in baking.    Then cut the sheet in half, fold up each piece and roll them out  once more, separately, in round sheets the size of your plate.  Press on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets thinnest  in the middle and thickest at the edges. If intended for puddings,  lay them in buttered soup-plates, and trim them evenly round the  edges. If the edges do not appear thick enough, you may take the  trimmings, put them all together, roll them out, and having cut  them in slips the breadth of the rim of the plate, lay them all  round to make the paste thicker at the edges, joining them nicely  and evenly, as every patch or crack will appear distinctly when  baked. Notch the rim handsomely with a very sharp knife. Fill the  dish with the mixture of the pudding, and bake it in a moderate  oven. The paste should be of a light brown colour. If the oven is  too slow, it will be soft and clammy; if too quick, it will not  have time to rise as high as it ought to do.    In making the best puff-paste,"]]]
