Preface  ------------------------    In publishing this volume I am discharging a duty solemnly  imposed upon me by my lamented father, just before his departure on  his last mission to the United States.    It affords me great pleasure to present the Autobiography of the  late Author to his relatives, his numerous friends, and to the  general reader.    The writer is well and favorably known through his \"Voice of  Warning,\" his \"Key to Theology,\" and other productions of his pen,  as well as through his personal labors. He was one of the first  Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, having  been called by revelation and ordained to that office by the  Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He was intimately  associated with the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, with Presidents B.  Young and H. C. Kimball, and other leading men, almost from the  first rise of the Church: his history, therefore, was so interwoven  with that of the Church, that many of the most interesting sketches  of Church history will be found therein.    The following pages, which embrace his life, ministry and  travels, and some of his best miscellaneous writings in prose and  verse, are the productions of his own pen.    He spared no pains to make the work a reliable record, and one  that would be acceptable to all lovers of truth. It is written in  the author's happiest style. He was an early pioneer of the Great  West, and travelled extensively in different countries.    His life was one of indefatigable labor, varied and complicated,  crowded with public labors and responsibilities, and full of  strange and extraordinary events--a life mingled with the extremes  of joy and sorrow--or, in the writer's own words, \"a truly eventful  one.\"    With confidence and satisfaction I submit this work to the  reader, feeling assured that it will stand upon its own merits. I  also have an earnest and sincere desire that it may be the means,  through the blessing of God, of accomplishing much good.    In editing the work I have been kindly assisted by the author's  personal friend, Elder John Taylor, to whom I feel deeply indebted.    The work embraces a period of history of fifty years--from the  author's boyhood to the time of his betrayal, by apostates, into  the hands of his enemies, and martyrdom.    The writer, in his second preface to his \"Voice of Warning,\" in  1846, gave expression to the following sentiment: \"Should the  author be called to sacrifice his life for the cause of truth, he  will have the consolation that it will be said of him, as it was  said of Abel, '_He being dead yet speaketh_.'\"    Editor.    Salt Lake City, _Dec., 1873_      To the Public  ------------------------    The circumstances attending the death of our beloved and much  esteemed Apostle, Parley Parker Pratt, rendered it impossible for  him to complete and prepare for publication the work in which he  had for many years been engaged, which is now presented to the  public.    The general history and incidents were recorded in various forms  of manuscript, some in book form, some in loose leaves, whilst  others were extracts from the \"Millennial Star\" and other  publications, yet they needed collating and revising preparatory to  their publication.    The deceased, as appears above, had laid upon his eldest son, P.  P. Pratt, the responsibility of publishing his history in case  anything should happen to prevent himself from doing it.    At the solicitation of Brother Pratt I undertook the task of  assisting to collate and revise the work preparatory to  publication. I found, as I expected it to be, quite an undertaking.  But, as Bro. Parley brought the gospel to and baptized me, and as I  have always entertained for him the most profound regard, I  esteemed it a duty, due alike to gratitude and respect, to assist  in having him properly presented before the community.    In the revision the changes are very few and unimportant, the  meaning being rigidly adhered to, and the original, so far as  possible, preserved intact. His doctrines and general views are  left unchanged, as he was always considered sound in doctrinal  points.    The multitudinous reminiscences manifested in his eventful life  exhibit a true and living faith in God and his religion--an  honesty of purpose, an inflexible will, and an unflagging,  indefatigable industry and perseverance. He possessed a  comprehensive mind, coupled with a sound judgment. He manifested an  indomitable fortitude under the most trying circumstances, and in  adversity and trials, as well as in prosperity, exhibited an  example worthy of praise and emulation. He was indeed a true  Latter-Day Saint, an honorable Apostle, a good and kind husband, an  affectionate father, a true friend, and an honest man.    From various premonitions which he had during his last visit  with me in New York, I was satisfied that, when I took my last sad  leave of him in that city, I should never see his face again in the  flesh. These presentiments were but too speedily and sadly  fulfilled. He has gone--but has left a name and a fame that will  live throughout time and burst forth in eternity; and in the  morning of the first resurrection, when the opening heavens shall  reveal the Son of God, and he shall proclaim, \"I am the  resurrection and the life,\" when Death shall deliver up the dead, I  expect to meet Bro. Parley in the resurrection of just.    John Taylor.

EDITORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT    This volume is one of a series of Monograph Supplements to the  Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology.  The publication of the  Monographs is authorized by the American Institute of Criminal  Law and Criminology.  Such a series has become necessary in  America by reason of the rapid development of criminological  research in this country since the organization of the Institute.  Criminology draws upon many independent branches of science, such  as Psychology, Anthropology, Neurology, Medicine, Education,  Sociology, and Law.  These sciences contribute to our  understanding of the nature of the delinquent and to our  knowledge of those conditions in home, occupation, school,  prison, etc., which are best adapted to elicit the behavior that  the race has learned to approve and cherish.    This series of Monographs, therefore, will include researches in  each of these departments of knowledge insofar as they meet our  special interest.    It is confidently anticipated that the series will stimulate the  study of the problems of delinquency, the State control of which  commands as great expenditure of human toil and treasure as does  the control of constructive public education.

PREFACE    Careful studies of offenders make group-types stand out with  distinctness.  Very little advancement in the treatment of  delinquents or criminals can be expected if typical  characteristics and their bearings are not understood.  The group  that our present work concerns itself with is comparatively  little known, although cases belonging to it, when met, attract  much attention.  It is to all who should be acquainted with these  striking mental and moral vagaries, particularly in their  forensic and psychological significances, that our essay is  addressed.  In some cases vital for the administration of  justice, an understanding of the types of personality and of  behavior here under discussion is a prime necessity.    The whole study of characterology or the motivation of conduct is  extremely new, and there are many indications of immense values  in uncovered fields.  Some appreciation of this fact may be  gained from the following pages which show the possibility of  tracing one form of behavior to its source.    We have laid under contribution practically the entire literature  on the subject, almost none of which is in English, and also the  thorough-going longitudinal case studies made by the Juvenile  Psychopathic Institute of Chicago.  In the latter material there  was found much of value bearing upon the subject of lying, false  accusation, and swindling of pathological character.    Our institute, later taken over officially by the Juvenile Court  of Cook County, was for five years maintained upon a foundation  provided by Mrs. W. F. Dummer.

Reasons for excluding types earlier  described as pathological liars will be found throughout our  work.  Better definition goes hand in hand with better  understanding, and it is only natural that formal, detailed  contemplation of the subject should lead to seeing new lines of  demarcation.    Definition:  Pathological lying is falsification entirely  disproportionate to any discernible end in view, engaged in by a  person who, at the time of observation, cannot definitely be  declared insane, feebleminded, or epileptic.  Such lying rarely,  if ever, centers about a single event; although exhibited in very  occasional cases for a short time, it manifests itself most  frequently by far over a period of years, or even a life time.  It represents a trait rather than an episode.  Extensive, very  complicated fabrications may be evolved.  This has led to the  synonyms:--mythomania; pseudologia phantastica.    It is true that in the previous literature, under the head of  pathological liars, cases of epilepsy, insanity, and mental  defect have been cited, but that is misleading.  A clear  terminology should be adopted.  The pathological liar forms a  species by himself and as such does not necessarily belong to any  of these larger classes.  It is, of course, scientifically  permissible, as well as practically valuable, to speak of the  epileptic or the otherwise abnormal person through his disease  engaging in pathological lying, but the main classification of an  individual should be decided by the main abnormal condition.    A good definition of pathological accusation follows the above  lines.  It is false accusation indulged in apart from any obvious  purpose.  Like the swindling of pathological liars, it appears  objectively more pernicious than the lying, but it is an  expression of the same tendency.  The most striking form of this  type of conduct is, of course, self-accusation.  Mendacious self-  impeachment seems especially convincing of abnormality.  Such  falsification not infrequently is episodic.    The inclusion of swindling in our discussion is due to the  natural evolution of this type of conduct from pathological  lying.  Swindling itself could hardly be called a pathological  phenomenon, since it is readily explicable by the fact that it is  entered into for reasons of tangible gain, but when it is the  product of the traits shown by a pathological liar it, just as  the lying itself, is a part of the pathological picture.  It is  the most concrete expression of the individual's tendencies.  This has been agreed to by several writers, for all have found it  easy to trace the development of one form of behavior into the  other.  As Wulffen says, ``Die Gabe zu Schwindeln ist eine `Lust  am Fabulieren.' ''  Over and over again we have observed the  phenomenon as the pathological liar gradually developed the  tendency to swindle.    Notwithstanding the grave and sensational social issues which  arise out of pathological lying, accusation, and swindling, there  is very little acquaintance with the characteristics of cases  showing this type of behavior, even by the people most likely to  meet the problems presented.  Lawyers, or other professional  specialists have slight knowledge of the subject.  Perhaps this  is due to the fact that the pathological lying does not follow  the usual lines of abnormal human behavior, unless it be among  the insane where other symptoms proclaim the true nature of the  case.  Another reason for the slight acquaintance with the  subject is the fact that almost nothing has been written on it in  English.    The important part which behavior of this type sometimes plays in  court work is witnessed to by the records of our own cases as  well as those cited in the previous literature.  The legal issues  presented by pathological lying may be exceedingly costly.  These  facts make it important that the well-equipped lawyer, as well as  the student of abnormal psychology, be familiar with the  specific, related facts.  For such students the cardinal point of  recognition of this class of conduct may at once be stated to be  its apparent baselessness.    The only method by which good understanding may be obtained of  the types of personality and mentality involved in pathological  lying, accusation, and swindling, as well as of the genetics of  these tendencies, is by the detailed reading of typical case  histories.  In this fact is found the reason for the presentation  of this monograph.  Appreciation of the nature of the phenomena  can only be obtained through acquaintance with an entire career.  Any of us may be confronted by fabrications so consistent as to  leave at one or several interviews the impression of truth.    Our selection of literature to summarize needs no explanation.  We have simply taken all that we could find which specifically  bears on the problem.  Lying, in general, especially as a form of  delinquency, has received attention at the hands of some authors,  notably Ferriani[1] and Duprat.[2]  The falsifications and  phantasies of children and adolescents have been dealt with by  Stanley Hall.[3]  None of these goes into the important, narrower  field with which we are here concerned.  The foreign literature  is vitally important in its opening up of the subject, but from  the standpoint of modern psychopathology it does not adequately  cover the ground.
