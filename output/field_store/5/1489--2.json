There once was a king of Persia, who at the beginning of his reign  had distinguished himself by many glorious and successful  conquests, and had afterwards enjoyed such profound peace and  tranquillity as rendered him the happiest of monarchs. His only  occasion for regret was that he had no heir to succeed him in the  kingdom after his death. One day, according to the custom of his  royal predecessors during their residence in the capital, he held  an assembly of his courtiers, at which all the ambassadors and  strangers of renown at his court were present. Among these there  appeared a merchant from a far-distant country, who sent a message  to the king craving an audience, as he wished to speak to him about  a very important matter. The king gave orders for the merchant to  be instantly admitted; and when the assembly was over, and all the  rest of the company had retired, the king inquired what was the  business which had brought him to the palace.    'Sire,' replied the merchant, 'I have with me, and beg your majesty  to behold, the most beautiful and charming slave it would be  possible to find if you searched every corner of the earth; if you  will but see her, you will surely wish to make her your wife.'    The fair slave was, by the king's commands, immediately brought in,  and no sooner had the king beheld a lady whose beauty and grace  surpassed anything he had ever imagined, than he fell passionately  in love with her, and determined to marry her at once. This was  done.    So the king caused the fair slave to be lodged in the next finest  apartment to his own, and gave particular orders to the matrons and  the women-slaves appointed to attend her, that they should dress  her in the richest robe they could find, and carry her the finest  pearl necklaces, the brightest diamonds, and other the richest  precious stones, that she might choose those she liked best.    The King of Persia's capital was situated in an island; and his  palace, which was very magnificent, was built upon the sea-shore;  his window looked towards the sea; and the fair slave's, which was  pretty near it, had also the same prospect, and it was the more  pleasant on account of the sea's beating almost against the foot of  the wall.    At the end of three days the fair slave, magnificently dressed, was  alone in her chamber, sitting upon a sofa, and leaning against one  of the windows that faced the sea, when the king, being informed  that he might visit her, came in. The slave hearing somebody walk  in the room, immediately turned her head to see who it was. She  knew him to be the king; but without showing the least surprise, or  so much as rising from her seat to salute or receive him, she  turned back to the window again as if he had been the most  insignificant person in the world.    The King of Persia was extremely surprised to see a slave of so  beauteous a form so very ignorant of the world. He attributed this  to the narrowness of her education, and the little care that had  been taken to instruct her in the first rules of civility. He went  to her at the window, where, notwithstanding the coldness and  indifference with which she had just now received him, she suffered  herself to be admired, kissed and embraced as much as he pleased,  but answered him not a word.    'My dearest life,' said the king, 'you neither answer, nor by any  visible token give me the least reason to believe that you are  listening to me. Why will you still keep to this obstinate silence,  which chills me? Do you mourn for your country, your friends, or  your relations? Alas! is not the King of Persia, who loves and  adores you, capable of comforting, and making you amends for the  loss of everything in the world?'    But the fair slave continued her astonishing reserve; and keeping  her eyes still fixed upon the ground, would neither look at him nor  utter a word; but after they had dined together in absolute  silence, the king went to the women whom he had assigned to the  fair slave as her attendants, and asked them if they had ever heard  her speak.    One of them presently made answer, 'Sire, we have neither seen her  open her lips, nor heard her speak any more than your majesty has  just now; we have rendered her our services; we have combed and  dressed her hair, put on her clothes, and waited upon her in her  chamber; but she has never opened her lips, so much as to say, That  is well, or, I like this. We have often asked, Madam, do you want  anything? Is there anything you wish for? Do but ask and command  us: but we have never been able to draw a word from her. We cannot  tell whether her silence proceeds from pride, sorrow, stupidity, or  dumbness; and this is all we can inform your majesty.'    The King of Persia was more astonished at hearing this than he was  before: however, believing the slave might have some reason for  sorrow, he endeavoured to divert and amuse her, but all in vain.  For a whole year she never afforded him the pleasure of a single  word.    At length, one day there were great rejoicings in the capital,  because to the king and his silent slave-queen there was born a son  and heir to the kingdom. Once more the king endeavoured to get a  word from his wife. 'My queen,' he said, 'I cannot divine what your  thoughts are; but, for my own part, nothing would be wanting to  complete my happiness and crown my joy but that you should speak to  me one single word, for something within me tells me you are not  dumb: and I beseech, I conjure you, to break through this long  silence, and speak but one word to me; and after that I care not  how soon I die.'    At this discourse the fair slave, who, according to her usual  custom, had hearkened to the king with downcast eyes, and had given  him cause to believe not only that she was dumb, but that she had  never laughed in her life, began to smile a little. The King of  Persia perceived it with a surprise that made him break forth into  an exclamation of joy; and no longer doubting but that she was  going to speak, he waited for that happy moment with an eagerness  and attention that cannot easily be expressed.    At last the fair slave, breaking her long-kept silence, thus  addressed herself to the king: 'Sire,' said she, 'I have so many  things to say to your majesty, that, having once broken silence, I  know not where to begin. However, in the first place, I think  myself in duty bound to thank you for all the favours and honours  you have been pleased to confer upon me, and to implore Heaven to  bless and prosper you, to prevent the wicked designs of your  enemies, and not to suffer you to die after hearing me speak, but  to grant you a long life. Had it never been my fortune to have  borne a child, I was resolved (I beg your majesty to pardon the  sincerity of my intention) never to have loved you, as well as to  have kept an eternal silence; but now I love you as I ought to do.'    The King of Persia, ravished to hear the fair slave speak, embraced  her tenderly. 'Shining light of my eyes,' said he, 'it is  impossible for me to receive a greater joy than what you have now  given me.'    The King of Persia, in the transport of his joy, said no more to  the fair slave. He left her, but in such a manner as made her  perceive that his intention was speedily to return: and being  willing that his joy should be made public, he sent in all haste  for the grand vizier. As soon as he came, he ordered him to  distribute a thousand pieces of gold among the holy men of his  religion, who had made vows of poverty; as also among the hospitals  and the poor, by way of returning thanks to Heaven: and his will  was obeyed by the direction of that minister.    After the King of Persia had given this order, he returned to the  fair slave again. 'Madam,' said he, 'pardon me for leaving you so  abruptly, but I hope you will indulge me with some conversation,  since I am desirous to know several things of great consequence.  Tell me, my dearest soul, what were the powerful reasons that  induced you to persist in that obstinate silence for a whole year  together, though you saw me, heard me talk to you, and ate and  drank with me every day.'    To satisfy the King of Persia's curiosity, 'Think,' replied the  queen, 'whether or no to be a slave, far from my own country,  without any hopes of ever seeing it again,--to have a heart torn  with grief at being separated for ever from my mother, my brother,  my friends, and my acquaintance,--are not these sufficient reasons  for my keeping a silence your majesty has thought so strange and  unaccountable? The love of our native country is as natural to us  as that of our parents; and the loss of liberty is insupportable to  every one who is not wholly destitute of common sense, and knows  how to set a value on it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#1)"],[1,"Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.                        Woman in the Nineteenth Century,    and    Kindred Papers Relating to the Sphere, Condition and Duties, of Woman.    by Margaret Fuller Ossoli.      Edited by her brother, Arthur B. Fuller.    With an introduction by Horace Greeley.          PREFACE.           *       *       *       *       *    It has been thought desirable that such papers of Margaret Fuller  Ossoli as pertained to the condition, sphere and duties of Woman,  should be collected and published together. The present volume  contains, not only her \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century,\"--which has  been before published, but for some years out of print, and  inaccessible to readers who have sought it,--but also several other  papers, which have appeared at various times in the _Tribune_ and  elsewhere, and yet more which have never till now been published.    My free access to her private manuscripts has given to me many papers,  relating to Woman, never intended for publication, which yet seem  needful to this volume, in order to present a complete and harmonious  view of her thoughts on this important theme. I have preferred to  publish them without alteration, as most just to her views and to the  reader; though, doubtless, she would have varied their expression and  form before giving them to the press.    It seems right here to remark, In order to avoid any misapprehension,  that Margaret Ossoli's thoughts wore not directed so exclusively to  the subject of the present volume as have been the minds of some  others. As to the movement for the emancipation of Woman from the  unjust burdens and disabilities to which she has been subject oven in  our own land, my sister could neither remain indifferent nor silent;  yet she preferred, as in respect to every other reform, to act  independently and to speak independently from her own stand-point, and  never to merge her individuality in any existing organization. This  she did, not as condemning such organizations, nor yet as judging them  wholly unwise or uncalled for, but because she believed she could  herself accomplish more for their true and high objects, unfettered by  such organizations, than if a member of them. The opinions avowed  throughout this volume, and wherever expressed, will, then, be found,  whether consonant with the reader's or no, in all cases honestly and  heartily her own,--the result of her own thought and faith. She never  speaks, never did speak, for any clique or sect, but as her individual  judgment, her reason and conscience, her observation and experience,  taught her to speak.    I could have wished that some one other than a brother should have  spoken a few fitting words of Margaret Fuller, as a woman, to form a  brief but proper accompaniment to this volume, which may reach some  who have never read her \"Memoirs,\" recently published, or have never  known her in personal life. This seemed the more desirable, because  the strictest verity in speaking of her must seem, to such as knew her  not, to be eulogy. But, after several disappointments as to the  editorship of the volume, the duty, at last, has seemed to devolve  upon me; and I have no reason to shrink from it but a sense of  inadequacy.    It is often supposed that literary women, and those who are active and  earnest in promoting great intellectual, philanthropic, or religious  movements, must of necessity neglect the domestic concerns of life. It  may be that this is sometimes so, nor can such neglect be too severely  reprehended; yet this is by no means a necessary result. Some of the  most devoted mothers the world has ever known, and whose homes were  the abode of every domestic virtue, themselves the embodiment of all  these, have been women whose minds were highly cultured, who loved and  devoted both thought and time to literature, and were active in  philanthropic and diffusive efforts for the welfare of the race.    The letter to M., which is published on page 345, is inserted chiefly  as showing the integrity and wisdom with which Margaret advised her  friends; the frankness with which she pointed out to every young woman  who asked counsel any deficiencies of character, and the duties of  life; and that among these latter she gave due place to the humblest  which serve to make home attractive and happy. It is but simple  justice for me to bear, in conjunction with many others, my tribute to  her domestic virtues and fidelity to all home duties. That her mind  found chief delight in the lowest forms of these duties may not be  true, and it would be sad if it were; but it is strictly true that  none, however humble, were either slighted or shunned.    In common with a younger sister and brother, I shared her care in my  early instruction, and found over one of the truest counsellors in a  sister who scorned not the youngest mind nor the simplest intellectual  wants in her love for communion, through converse or the silent page,  with the minds of the greatest and most gifted.    During a lingering illness, in childhood, well do I remember her as  the angel of the sick-chamber, reading much to me from books useful  and appropriate, and telling many a narrative not only fitted to wile  away the pain of disease and the weariness of long confinement, but to  elevate the mind and heart, and to direct them to all things noble and  holy; over ready to watch while I slept, and to perform every gentle  and kindly office. But her care of the sick--that she did not neglect,  but was eminent in that sphere of womanly duty, even when no tie of  kindred claimed this of her, Mr. Cass's letter abundantly shows; and  also that this gentleness was united to a heroism which most call  manly, but which, I believe, may as justly be called truly womanly.  Mr. Cass's letter is inserted because it arrived too late to find a  place in her \"Memoirs,\" and yet more because it bears much on Margaret  Ossoli's characteristics as a woman.    A few also of her private letters and papers, not bearing, save,  indirectly, on the subject of this volume, are yet inserted in it, as  further illustrative of her thought, feeling and action, in life's  various relations. It is believed that nothing which exhibits a true  woman, especially in her relations to others as friend, sister,  daughter, wife, or mother, can fail to interest and be of value to her  sex, indeed to all who are interested in human welfare and  advancement, since these latter so much depend on the fidelity of  Woman. Nor will anything pertaining to the education and care of  children be deemed irrelevant, especially by mothers, upon whom these  duties must always largely devolve.    Of the intellectual gifts and wide culture of Margaret Fuller there is  no need that I should speak, nor is it wise that one standing in my  relation to her should. Those who knew her personally feel that no  words ever flowed from her pen equalling the eloquent utterances of  her lips; yet her works, though not always a clear oppression of her  thoughts, are the evidences to which the world will look as proof of  her mental greatness.    On one point, however, I do wish to bear testimony--not needed with  those who knew her well, but interesting, perhaps, to some readers  into whose bands this volume may fall. It is on a subject which one  who knew her from his childhood up--at _home_, where best the  _heart_ and _soul_ can be known,--in the unrestrained hours  of domestic life,--in various scenes, and not for a few days, nor  under any peculiar circumstances--can speak with confidence, because  he speaks what he \"doth know, and testifieth what he hath seen.\" It  relates to her Christian faith and hope. \"With all her intellectual  gifts, with all her high, moral, and noble characteristics,\" there are  some who will ask, \"was her intellectual power sanctified by Christian  faith as its basis? Were her moral qualities, her beneficent life, the  results of a renewed heart?\" I feel no hesitation here, nor would  think it worth while to answer such questions at all, were her life to  be read and known by all who read this volume, and were I not  influenced also, in some degree, by the tone which has characterized a  few sectarian reviews of her works, chiefly in foreign periodicals.  Surely, if the Saviour's test, \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\"  be the true one, Margaret Ossoli was preeminently a Christian. If a  life of constant self-sacrifice,--if devotion to the welfare of  kindred and the race,--if conformity to what she believed God's law,  so that her life seemed ever the truest form of prayer, active  obedience to the Deity,--in fine, if carrying Christianity into all  the departments of action, so far as human infirmity allows,--if these  be the proofs of a Christian, then whoever has read her \"Memoirs\"  thoughtfully, and without sectarian prejudice or the use of sectarian  standards of judgment, must feel her to have been a Christian. But not  alone in outward life, in mind and heart, too, was she a Christian.  The being brought into frequent and intimate contact with religious  persons has been one of the chief privileges of my vocation, but never  yet have I met with any person whose reverence for holy things was  deeper than hers. Abhorring, as all honest minds must, every species  of cant, she respected true religious thought and feeling, by  whomsoever cherished. God seemed nearer to her than to any person I  have over known. In the influences of His Holy Spirit upon the heart  she fully believed, and in experience realized them. Jesus, the friend  of man, can never have been more truly loved and honored than she  loved and honored him. I am aware that this is strong language, but  strength of language cannot equal the strength of my conviction on a  point where I have had the best opportunities of judgment. Rich as is  the religion of Jesus in its list of holy confessors, yet it can spare"]]]
