The rising tide, lapping slowly and gently in from the  ocean, was floating the boats beached on the shingle, and was gradually  driving back the crowd of barefooted children who had ventured out in  search of mussels, and was sending them, shrieking with mirth, scampering  up the seaweed-covered steps that led to the fish market. On the crag-top  above the town the corn had been cut, and harvesters were busy laying the  sheaves together in stooks. The yellow fields shone in the afternoon  light as if the hill were crowned with gold.    Walking along the narrow cobbled path that led past the harbour and up on  to the cliff, Mavis and Merle looked at the scene around with that sense  of rejoicing proprietorship with which we are wont to revisit the pet  place of our adoption. It was two whole months since they had been in  Chagmouth, and as they both considered the little town to be the absolute  hub of the universe it was really a great event to find themselves once  more in its familiar streets. They had spent the summer holidays with  their father and mother in the north, and had come back to Durracombe  just in time for the reopening of school. On this first Saturday after  their return to Devonshire they had motored with Uncle David to his  branch surgery at Chagmouth, and were looking forward to several hours of  amusement while he visited his patients at the sanatorium.    Readers who have followed the adventures of Mavis and Merle Ramsay in  _A Fortunate Term_ will remember that the sisters, on account of  Mavis's health, had come to live with their great-uncle Dr. Tremayne at  Durracombe, where they attended school daily at 'The Moorings.' Dr.  Ramsay, their father, had decided shortly to leave his practice at  Whinburn and go into partnership with Dr. Tremayne, but the removal to  Devonshire could not take place till nearly Christmas, so the girls were  to spend another term in sole charge of Uncle David, Aunt Nellie, and  Jessop the elderly housekeeper, an arrangement which, though they were  sorry to be parted from their parents, pleased them uncommonly well. It  was a favourite excursion of theirs to accompany their uncle on Saturdays  when he motored to visit patients at Chagmouth. On these occasions they  would have lunch and tea with him at Grimbal's Farm, where he had his  surgery, and would spend the intervening time on the seashore or  wandering along the cliffs. To-day, tempted by the brilliant sunshine,  they had brought their bathing costumes, towels, and tea-basket, and  meant to secure the last dip of the holidays in case the weather should  change and further mermaiding should prove impossible. They chatted  briskly as they climbed the path up the cliff.    \"Too bad Bevis has gone back to school! I thought we should just have  seen him before he went!\"    \"And Tudor too! I met Babbie, while you were inside Carlyon's shop buying  chocs, and she told me Tudor started yesterday, and Gwen went last  Tuesday to a boarding-school near London. It was decided quite in a hurry  because there happened to be a vacancy for her. It's a very fashionable  school where they take the girls out to theatres and concerts and all  sorts of places. Gwen's fearfully thrilled to go. They wanted to send her  there before, only they couldn't get her in. Somebody else has left  unexpectedly though, so there was a cubicle at liberty for her.\"    \"It will just suit Gwen! But she'll miss her riding. She nearly lived on  Taffy's back as a rule. Won't it be very lonely for Babbie all by herself  with a governess? Will she come to school for French and dancing as  usual?\"    \"She's coming to 'The Moorings' altogether. They're going to motor her  over every day, and fetch her back at four. She's quite pleased about it.  She always liked 'The Moorings' much better than Gwen did.\"    \"And 'The Moorings,' from all reports, is going to be an utterly  different school this term!\"    \"So I suppose! Hope it won't be too much changed, that's all! A new  teacher, hot from a High School, means a new broom that will sweep very  clean. It strikes me those nice do-as-you-please lessons with Miss Fanny  will be dreams of the past, and we shall have to set our brains to work  and swat! Ugh! It's not a particularly delirious prospect!\"    Mavis laughed.    \"Don't wrinkle your forehead into quite so many kinks! You look about  forty!\" she objected. \"It mayn't turn out as hard as you expect. Anyhow,  don't let us spoil the last Saturday of the holidays with thinking about  it. I want to enjoy this afternoon thoroughly. I feel as if I'd been away  from Chagmouth for years and years. Isn't it priceless to see it again?  Have a chocolate! Or would you rather take a piece of toffee?\"    The two girls had been mounting steadily as they talked, and were now  walking along a narrow track which led along the top of the cliffs. Below  them lay the gorgeous-hued crags of the rugged coast and a great expanse  of sea, silver at the horizon, blue at mid-distance, and deep metallic  green where it touched the shore. Innumerable sea-birds wheeled and  screamed below, and the incoming tide lapped with little white waves over  the reefs of rocks, and submerged the pools where gobies were darting  about, and sea-anemones were stretching out crimson or green tentacles,  and scurrying crabs were hiding among masses of brown oar-weed. Above and  beyond was a network of brambles, where ripe blackberries hung in such  tempting clusters that it was hardly in human nature to resist them, and  Merle, with purple-stained fingers, loitered and lingered to enjoy the  feast.    \"If you're not quick the tide will have turned and it won't be half so  nice to bathe!\" urged Mavis impatiently. \"Do hurry up now, and you can  absolutely gorge on blackberries as we come back, if you want to. I'll  promise to wait for you then.\"    \"Right-o! I'm coming! Though I must just get that one big beauty! There!  I won't eat a single one more till I've had my dip. We must be close to  the cove now. I'll run if you like!\"    The bathing-place for which the girls were bound was a sandy creek among  the rocks. A hundred years ago it had been a favourite spot for smugglers  to land contraband goods, and a series of steps cut in the cliff  testified to its former use. Nowadays it was commonly deserted, and in  the early part of the summer, when Mavis and Merle had been wont to visit  it, they had had it all to themselves. They had gone there so often and  found it untenanted that they had come to regard it as their private  property, and, in consequence, they were most unreasonably annoyed, when  climbing down the steps, to hear sounds of laughter rising up from below.    \"Who's in _our_ cove?\" demanded Merle sharply, somewhat as Father  Bruin asked the immortal question, \"Who's sleeping on _my_ bed?\"    \"All the world, I should say!\" replied the aggrieved voice of Mavis, who  was in front and had first view of the scene beneath. \"The place is an  absolute 'seaside resort.' Never saw so many people in my life before!  Where do they all come from?\"    The little cove, _their_ cove, which in June had been so  delightfully secluded and retired, was undoubtedly invaded by quite a  number of visitors. Children were paddling or scampering along the sands,  wet heads were bobbing in and out of the water, every rocky crevice was  in use as a dressing-room, picnic parties were taking tea on the rocks,  and a circle of boys and girls were playing a noisy game at the brink of  the waves. Very ruefully Mavis and Merle descended to swell the throng.  It was not at all the sort of bathe which they had anticipated, and, had  there been another available spot within reach, they would have utterly  disdained it.    \"Shall we go on to Yellow Head?\" ventured Merle hesitatingly.    \"There isn't time. The tide would be out before we got there, and it's a  perfect tangle of oar-weed unless the water's high. Never mind! There'll  be elbow-room in the sea at any rate. There's a corner here where we can  undress. Come along! O-o-h! There's some one else inside!\"    [Illustration: \"WE'RE JUST READY! YOU CAN COME IN IF YOU LIKE!\"]    \"We're just ready! You can come in if you like!\" proclaimed a voice, as  two girls in navy bathing costumes and rubber caps issued from behind a  rock, and running swiftly down the sand plunged into the water.    Availing themselves of the opportunity Mavis and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#1)"],[1,"HISTORY    AN ESSAY IN THE PHILOSOPHY  OF HISTORY    By S. M. Dubnow          PREFACE TO THE GERMAN TRANSLATION      The author of the present essay, S. M. Dubnow, occupies a well-nigh  dominating position in Russian-Jewish literature as an historian and  an acute critic. His investigations into the history of the  Polish-Russian Jews, especially his achievements in the history of  Chassidism, have been of fundamental importance in these departments.  What raises Mr. Dubnow far above the status of the professional  historian, and awakens the reader's lively interest in him, is not so  much the matter of his books, as the manner of presentation. It is  rare to meet with an historian in whom scientific objectivity and  thoroughness are so harmoniously combined with an ardent temperament  and plastic ability. Mr. Dubnow's scientific activity, first and last,  is a striking refutation of the widespread opinion that identifies  attractiveness of form in the work of a scholar with superficiality of  content. Even his strictly scientific investigations, besides offering  the scholar a wealth of new suggestions, form instructive and  entertaining reading matter for the educated layman. In his critical  essays, Mr. Dubnow shows himself to be possessed of keen psychologic  insight. By virtue of this quality of delicate perception, he aims to  assign to every historical fact its proper place in the line of  development, and so establish the bond between it and the general  history of mankind. This psychologic ability contributes vastly to the  interest aroused by Mr. Dubnow's historical works outside of the  limited circle of scholars. There is a passage in one of his books[1]  in which, in his incisive manner, he expresses his views on the limits  and tasks of historical writing. As the passage bears upon the methods  employed in the present essay, and, at the same time, is a  characteristic specimen of our author's style, I take the liberty of  quoting:    \"The popularization of history is by no means to be pursued to the  detriment of its severely scientific treatment. What is to be guarded  against is the notion that tedium is inseparable from the scientific  method. I have always been of the opinion that the dulness commonly  looked upon as the prerogative of scholarly inquiries, is not an  inherent attribute. In most cases it is conditioned, not by the nature  of the subject under investigation, but by the temper of the  investigator. Often, indeed, the tediousness of a learned disquisition  is intentional: it is considered one of the polite conventions of the  academic guild, and by many is identified with scientific thoroughness  and profound learning.... If, in general, deadening, hide-bound caste  methods, not seldom the cover for poverty of thought and lack of  cleverness, are reprehensible, they are doubly reprehensible in  history. The history of a people is not a mere mental discipline, like  botany or mathematics, but a living science, a _magistra vitae_,  leading straight to national self-knowledge, and acting to a certain  degree upon the national character. History is a science _by_ the  people, _for_ the people, and, therefore, its place is the open  forum, not the scholar's musty closet. We relate the events of the  past to the people, not merely to a handful of archaeologists and  numismaticians. We work for national self-knowledge, not for our own  intellectual diversion.\"      [1] In the introduction to his _Historische Mitteilungen,      Vorarbeiten zu einer Geschichte der pol-nischrussischen      Juden_.    These are the principles that have guided Mr. Dubnow in all his works,  and he has been true to them in the present essay, which exhibits in a  remarkably striking way the author's art of making \"all things seem  fresh and new, important and attractive.\" New and important his essay  undoubtedly is. The author attempts, for the first time, a psychologic  characterization of Jewish history. He endeavors to demonstrate the  inner connection between events, and develop the ideas that underlie  them, or, to use his own expression, lay bare the soul of Jewish  history, which clothes itself with external events as with a bodily  envelope. Jewish history has never before been considered from this  philosophic point of view, certainly not in German literature. The  present work, therefore, cannot fail to prove stimulating. As for the  poet's other requirement, attractiveness, it is fully met by the work  here translated. The qualities of Mr. Dubnow's style, as described  above, are present to a marked degree. The enthusiasm flaming up in  every line, coupled with his plastic, figurative style, and his  scintillating conceits, which lend vivacity to his presentation, is  bound to charm the reader. Yet, in spite of the racy style, even the  layman will have no difficulty in discovering that it is not a clever  journalist, an artificer of well-turned phrases, who is speaking to  him, but a scholar by profession, whose foremost concern is with  historical truth, and whose every statement rests upon accurate,  scientific knowledge; not a bookworm with pale, academic blood  trickling through his veins, but a man who, with unsoured mien, with  fresh, buoyant delight, offers the world the results laboriously  reached in his study, after all evidences of toil and moil have been  carefully removed; who derives inspiration from the noble and the  sublime in whatever guise it may appear, and who knows how to  communicate his inspiration to others.    The translator lays this book of an accomplished and spirited  historian before the German public. He does so in the hope that it  will shed new light upon Jewish history even for professional  scholars. He is confident that in many to whom our unexampled past of  four thousand years' duration is now _terra incognita_, it will  arouse enthusiastic interest, and even to those who, like the  translator himself, differ from the author in religious views, it will  furnish edifying and suggestive reading.
