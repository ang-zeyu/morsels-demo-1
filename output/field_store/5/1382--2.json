It  describes how the book was planned, and how at last it came to be  written. The novel--'The Weavers'--of which it was the herald, as  one might say, was published in 1907. The reception of Donovan Pasha  convinced me beyond peradventure, that the step I took in enlarging my  field of work was as wise in relation to my art as in its effect upon my  mind, temperament and faculty for writing. I knew Egypt by study quite  as well as I knew the Dominion of Canada, the difference being, of  course, that the instinct for the life of Canada was part of my very  being itself; but there are great numbers of people who live their lives  for fifty or seventy or eighty years in a country, and have no real  instinct for understanding. There are numberless Canadians who do not  understand Canada, Englishmen who know nothing of England, and Americans  who do not understand the United States. If it is so that I have some  instinct for the life of Canada, and have expressed it to the world  with some accuracy and fidelity, it is apparent that the capacity for  understanding could not be limited absolutely to one environment. That I  understood Canada could not be established by the fact that I had spent  my boyhood there, but only by the fact that some inner vision permitted  me to see it as it really was. That inner vision, however, if it was  anything at all was not in blinders, seeing only one section of the life  of the world. Relatively it might see more deeply, more intimately in  that place where habit of life had made the man familiar with all its  detail, but the same vision turned elsewhere to fields where study  and sympathy played a devoted part, could not fail to see; though the  workman's craft, which made material the vision, might fail.    The reception given Donovan Pasha convinced me that neither the vision  nor the craftsmanship had wholly failed, whatever the degree of success  which had been reached. Anglo-Egyptians approved the book. Its pages  passed through the hands of an Englishman who had done over twenty  years' service in the British army in Egypt and in official positions  in the Egyptian administration, and I do not think that he made six  corrections in the whole three hundred pages. He had himself a great  gift for both music and painting; he was essentially exacting where any  literature touching Egypt was concerned; but I am glad to think that,  whatever he thought of the book as fiction, he did not find it necessary  to grant absolution as to the facts and the details of incidents in  character and life pourtrayed in Donovan Pasha.    Who the original of 'Donovan Pasha' was I shall never say, but he was  real. There is, however, in the House of Commons today a young and  active politician once in the Egyptian service, and who bears a most  striking resemblance to the purely imaginary portrait which Mr. Talbot  Kelly, the artist, drew of the Dicky Donovan of the book. This young  politician, with his experience in the diplomatic service, is in manner,  disposition, capacity, and in his neat, fine, and alert physical frame,  the very image of Dicky Donovan, as in my mind I perceived him; and when  I first saw him I was almost thunderstruck, because he was to me Dicky  Donovan come to life. There was nothing Dicky Donovan did or said or saw  or heard which had not its counterpart in actual things in Egypt. The  germ of most of the stories was got from things told me, or things that  I saw, heard of, or experienced in Egypt itself. The first story of  the book--'While the Lamp Holds out to Burn'--was suggested to me by an  incident which I saw at a certain village on the Nile, which I will not  name. Suffice it to say that the story in the main was true. Also the  chief incident of the story, called 'The Price of the Grindstone--and  the Drum', is true. The Mahommed Seti of that story was the servant of  a friend of mine, and he did in life what I made him do in the tale. 'On  the Reef of Norman's Woe', which more than one journal singled out as  showing what extraordinary work was being done in Egypt by a handful of  British officials, had its origin in something told me by my friend Sir  John Rogers, who at one time was at the head of the Sanitary Department  of the Government of Egypt.    I could take the stories one by one, and show the seeds from which this  little plantation of fiction sprang, but I will not go further than to  refer to a story called 'Fielding Had an Orderly', the idea of which was  contained in the experience of a British official whose courage was  as cool as his wit, and both were extremely dangerous weapons, used at  times against those who were opposed to him. When I read a book like  'Said the Fisherman', however, with its wonderfully intimate knowledge  of Oriental life and the thousand nuances which only the born  Orientalist can give, I look with tempered pride upon Donovan Pasha.  Still I think that it caught and held some phases of Egyptian life  which the author of 'Said the Fisherman' might perhaps miss, since the  observation of every artist has its own idiosyncrasy, and what strikes  one observer will not strike another.          A FOREWORD    It is now twelve years since I began giving to the public tales of life  in lands well known to me. The first of them were drawn from Australia  and the Islands of the Southern Pacific, where I had lived and roamed  in the middle and late Eighties. They appeared in various English  magazines, and were written in London far from the scenes which  suggested them. None of them were written on the spot, as it were. I did  not think then, and I do not think now, that this was perilous to their  truthfulness. After many years of travel and home-staying observation  I have found that all worth remembrance, the salient things and scenes,  emerge clearly out of myriad impressions, and become permanent in mind  and memory. Things so emerging are typical at least, and probably true.    Those tales of the Far South were given out with some prodigality. They  did not appear in book form, however; for, at the time I was sending out  these Antipodean sketches, I was also writing--far from the scenes where  they were laid--a series of Canadian tales, many of which appeared in  the 'Independent' of New York, in the 'National Observer', edited by Mr.  Henley, and in the 'Illustrated London News'. By accident, and on the  suggestion of my friend Mr. Henley, the Canadian tales 'Pierre and his  People' were published first; with the result that the stories of the  Southern Hemisphere were withheld from publication, though they have  been privately printed and duly copyrighted. Some day I may send them  forth, but meanwhile I am content to keep them in my own care.    Moved always by deep interest in the varied manifestations of life in  different portions of the Empire, five or six years ago I was attracted  to the Island of Jersey, in the Channel Sea, by the likeness of the  origin of her people with that of the French-Canadians. I went to live  at St. Heliers for a time, and there wrote a novel called 'The Battle of  the Strong'.    Nor would it be thought strange that, having visited another and newer  sphere of England's influence, Egypt to wit, in 1889, I should then  determine that, when I could study the country at leisure, I should  try to write of the life there, so full of splendour and of primitive  simplicity; of mystery and guilt; of cruel indolence and beautiful  industry; of tyranny and devoted slavery; of the high elements of a true  democracy and the shameful practices of a false autocracy; all touched  off by the majesty of an ancient charm, the nobility of the remotest  history.    The years went by, and, four times visiting Egypt, at last I began to  write of her. That is now five years ago. From time to time the stories  which I offer to the public in this volume were given forth. It is  likely that the old Anglo-Egyptian and the historical student may find  some anachronisms and other things to criticise; but the anachronisms  are deliberate, and even as in writing of Canada and Australia, which I  know very well, I have here, perhaps, sacrificed superficial exactness  while trying to give the more intimate meaning and spirit. I have never  thought it necessary to apologise for this disregard of photographic  accuracy,--that may be found in my note-books,--and I shall not begin to  do so now. I shall be sufficiently grateful if this series of tales does  no more than make ready the way for the novel of Egyptian life on which  I have been working for some years. It is an avant courier. I hope,  however, that it may be welcomed for its own sake.                                G. P.           NOTE: A Glossary will be found at the end of the volume.            WHILE THE LAMP HOLDS OUT TO BURN    There is a town on the Nile which Fielding Bey called Hasha, meaning  \"Heaven Forbid!\" He loathed inspecting it. Going up the Nile, he would  put off visiting it till he came down; coming down, he thanked his fates  if accident carried him beyond it.

THE LOOM OF DESTINY          INTRODUCTION    When I turn over the hundreds of pages of this book, I have a feeling  that I am looking upon something for which I have no particular  responsibility, though it has a strange contour of familiarity. It is as  though one looks upon a scene in which one had lived and moved, with the  friendly yet half-distant feeling that it once was one's own possession  but is so no longer. I should think the feeling to be much like that of  the old man whose sons, gone to distant places, have created their  own plantations of life and have themselves become the masters of  possessions. Also I suppose that when I read the story through again  from the first page to the last, I shall recreate the feeling in which  I lived when I wrote it, and it will become a part of my own identity  again. That distance between himself and his work, however, which  immediately begins to grow as soon as a book leaves the author's hands  for those of the public, is a thing which, I suppose, must come to one  who produces a work of the imagination. It is no doubt due to the fact  that every piece of art which has individuality and real likeness to  the scenes and character it is intended to depict is done in a kind of  trance. The author, in effect, self-hypnotises himself, has created  an atmosphere which is separate and apart from that of his daily  surroundings, and by virtue of his imagination becomes absorbed in  that atmosphere. When the book is finished and it goes forth, when the  imagination is relaxed and the concentration of mind is withdrawn, the  atmosphere disappears, and then. One experiences what I feel when I take  up 'The Weavers' and, in a sense, wonder how it was done, such as it is.    The frontispiece of the English edition represents a scene in the House  of Commons, and this brings to my mind a warning which was given me  similar to that on my entering new fields outside the one in which  I first made a reputation in fiction. When, in a certain year, I  determined that I would enter the House of Commons I had many friends  who, in effect, wailed and gnashed their teeth. They said that it would  be the death of my imaginative faculties; that I should never write  anything any more; that all the qualities which make literature living  and compelling would disappear. I thought this was all wrong then, and  I know it is all wrong now. Political life does certainly interfere  with the amount of work which an author may produce. He certainly cannot  write a book every year and do political work as well, but if he does  not attempt to do the two things on the same days, as it were, but in  blocks of time devoted to each separately and respectively, he will  only find, as I have found, that public life the conflict of it, the  accompanying attrition of mind, the searching for the things which will  solve the problems of national life, the multitudinous variations of  character with which one comes in contact, the big issues suddenly  sprung upon the congregation of responsible politicians, all are  stimulating to the imagination, invigorating to the mind, and  marvellously freshening to every literary instinct. No danger to the  writer lies in doing political work, if it does not sap his strength  and destroy his health. Apart from that, he should not suffer. The very  spirit of statesmanship is imagination, vision; and the same quality  which enables an author to realise humanity for a book is necessary for  him to realise humanity in the crowded chamber of a Parliament.    So far as I can remember, whatever was written of The Weavers, no critic  said that it lacked imagination. Some critics said it was too crowded  with incident; that there was enough incident in it for two novels; some  said that the sweep was too wide, but no critic of authority declared  that the book lacked vision or the vivacity of a living narrative. It  is not likely that I shall ever write again a novel of Egypt, but I have  made my contribution to Anglo-Egyptian literature, and I do not think I  failed completely in showing the greatness of soul which enabled one man  to keep the torch of civilisation, of truth, justice, and wholesome love  alight in surroundings as offensive to civilisation as was Egypt in the  last days of Ismail Pasha--a time which could be well typified by the  words put by Bulwer Lytton in the mouth of Cardinal Richelieu:           \"I found France rent asunder,          Sloth in the mart and schism in the temple;          Broils festering to rebellion; and weak laws          Rotting away with rust in antique sheaths.          I have re-created France; and, from the ashes          Of the old feudal and decrepit carcase,          Civilisation on her luminous wings          Soars, phoenix-like, to Jove!\"    Critics and readers have endeavoured to identify the main  characteristics of The Weavers with figures in Anglo-Egyptian and  official public life. David Claridge was, however, a creature of the  imagination. It has been said that he was drawn from General Gordon. I  am not conscious of having taken Gordon for David's prototype, though,  as I was saturated with all that had been written about Gordon, there  is no doubt that something of that great man may have found its way  into the character of David Claridge. The true origin of David Claridge,  however, may be found in a short story called 'All the World's Mad', in  Donovan Pasha, which was originally published by Lady Randolph Churchill  in an ambitious but defunct magazine called 'The Anglo-Saxon Review'.  The truth is that David Claridge had his origin in a fairly close  understanding of, and interest in, Quaker life. I had Quaker relatives  through the marriage of a connection of my mother, and the original of  Benn Claridge, the uncle of David, is still alive, a very old man, who  in my boyhood days wore the broad brim and the straight preacher-like  coat of the old-fashioned Quaker. The grandmother of my wife was also a  Quaker, and used the \"thee\" and \"thou\" until the day of her death.    Here let me say that criticism came to me from several quarters both  in England and America on the use of these words thee and thou, and  statements were made that the kind of speech which I put into David  Claridge's mouth was not Quaker speech. For instance, they would not  have it that a Quaker would say, \"Thee will go with me\"--as though they  were ashamed of the sweet inaccuracy of the objective pronoun being used  in the nominative; but hundreds of times I have myself heard Quakers  use \"thee\" in just such a way in England and America. The facts are,  however, that Quakers differ extensively in their habits, and there grew  up in England among the Quakers in certain districts a sense of shame  for false grammar which, to say the least, was very childish. To be  deliberately and boldly ungrammatical, when you serve both euphony and  simplicity, is merely to give archaic charm, not to be guilty of an  offence. I have friends in Derbyshire who still say \"Thee thinks,\"  etc., and I must confess that the picture of a Quaker rampant over my  deliberate use of this well-authenticated form of speech produced to  my mind only the effect of an infuriated sheep, when I remembered the  peaceful attribute of Quaker life and character. From another quarter  came the assurance that I was wrong when I set up a tombstone with a  name upon it in a Quaker graveyard. I received a sarcastic letter from  a lady on the borders of Sussex and Surrey upon this point, and I  immediately sent her a first-class railway ticket to enable her to visit  the Quaker churchyard at Croydon, in Surrey, where dead and gone Quakers  have tombstones by the score, and inscriptions on them also. It is a  good thing to be accurate; it is desperately essential in a novel.  The average reader, in his triumph at discovering some slight error of  detail, would consign a masterpiece of imagination, knowledge of life  and character to the rubbish-heap.    I believe that 'The Weavers' represents a wider outlook of life, closer  understanding of the problems which perplex society, and a clearer  view of the verities than any previous book written by me, whatever its  popularity may have been. It appealed to the British public rather more  than 'The Right of Way', and the great public of America and the"]]]
