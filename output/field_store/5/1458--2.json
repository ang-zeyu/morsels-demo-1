[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7889"],[0,"Erotica Romana (#1)"],[1,"ROMANA    By Johann Wolfgang Goethe            I      Here's where I've planted my garden and here I shall care for love's blossoms--        As I am taught by my muse, carefully sort them in plots:      Fertile branches, whose product is golden fruit of my lifetime,        Set here in happier years, tended with pleasure today.      You, stand here at my side, good Priapus--albeit from thieves I've        Nothing to fear. Freely pluck, whosoever would eat.      --Hypocrites, those are the ones! If weakened with shame and bad conscience        One of those criminals comes, squinting out over my garden,      Bridling at nature's pure fruit, punish the knave in his hindparts,        Using the stake which so red rises there at your loins.          II      Tell me ye stones and give me O glorious palaces answer.        Speak O ye streets but one word. Genius, art thou alive?      Yes, here within thy sanctified walls there's a soul in each object,        ROMA eternal. For me, only, are all things yet mute.      Who will then tell me in whispers and where must I find just the window        Where one day she'll be glimpsed: creature who'll scorch me with love?      Can't I divine yet the paths through which over and over        To her and from her I'll go, squandering valuable time?      Visiting churches and palaces, all of the ruins and the pillars,        I, a responsible man, profit from making this trip.      With my business accomplished, ah, then shall only one temple,        AMOR's temple alone, take the initiate in.      Rome, thou art a whole world, it is true, and yet without love this        World would not be the world, Rome would cease to be Rome.          III      More than ever I dreamed, I have found it: my happy good fortune!        Cupid sagaciously led past those palazzos so fine.      He of course knows very well (and I have also discovered)        What, beneath tapestries rich, gilded boudoirs conceal.      One may if one wishes call him a blind, wanton boy--but I know you,        Clever Cupid, too well! O, incorruptible god!      We were by no means inveigled to enter facades so majestic;        Somber cortile we passed, balcony high and gallant,      Hastening onward until an humble but exquisite portal        Offered a refuge to both, ardent seeker and guide.      Here he provides me with ev'rything, sees that I get what I call for;        Each day that passes he spreads freshly plucked roses for me.      --Isn't that heaven on earth? Say, beautiful Lady Borghese,        What would you give to me more? --You, Nipotina, what yours?      Banquets and game tables, operas, balls, promenades down the Corso?        These but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times.      Finery, haughtiness do not entice me. Does one not lift a        Gown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool?      If she's to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom,        Doesn't he want her to be free from all brooches and chains?      Must not the jewelry, and then the lace and the bustles and whalebone        All of it come off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?      I encounter no troubles like those. Simple dress of rough homespun,        At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles in folds to the floor.      Quickly he carries the girl as she's clad in chemise of coarse linen--        Just as a nursemaid might, playfully up to her bed.      Drapings of satin are absent; the mattress is quite unembroidered.        Large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two.      Jupiter's welcome to more from his Juno if he can get it;        Let any mortal find rest, softer, wherever he can.      We are content with Cupid's delights, authentic and naked--        And with the exquisite creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.          IV      Ask whomever you will but you'll never find out where I'm lodging,        High society's lords, ladies so groomed and refined.      \"Tell me, was Werther authentic? Did all of that happen in real life?\"        \"Lotte, oh where did she live, Werther's only true love?\"      How many times have I cursed those frivolous pages that broadcast        Out among all mankind passions I felt in my youth!      Were he my brother, why then I 'd have murdered poor Werther.        Yet his despondent ghost couldn't have sought worse revenge.      That's the way \"Marlborough,\" the ditty, follows the Englishman's travels        Down to Livorno from France, thence from Livorno to Rome,      All of the way into Naples and then, should he flee on to Madras,        \"Marlborough\" will surely be there, \"Marlborough\" sung in the port.      Happily now I've escaped, and my mistress knows Werther and Lotte        Not a whit better than who might be this man in her bed:      That he's a foreigner, footloose and lusty, is all she could tell you,        Who beyond mountains and snow, dwelt in a house made of wood.          V      Do not, beloved, regret that you yielded to me so quickly:        I entertain no base, insolent thoughts about you.      Arrows of Cupid work divers effects. Some do but scratch us:        Slow and insidious these poison our hearts over years.      Yet with a head freshly honed and cunningly fledged, certain others        Pierce to the marrow, inflame rapidly there our blood.      When gods and goddesses in days of heroes made love, then        Lust followed look and desire, with no delay, was indulged.      Surely you don't think the goddess of love lost a moment reflecting        When, in Idean grove, Anchises caught her eye.      Nor did Luna delay about kissing that beautiful dreamer--        Jealous Aurora had else hastily wakened the lad.      At the loud banquet Hero regarded Leander--then promptly        Into dark waters he plunged, ardently swam toward his love.      When Rhea Silvia, princess and virgin, came down to the Tiber        Just to fetch water, a god seized her and that is the way      Mars begat himself sons, a pair of twins whom a she wolf        Suckled. Today a proud Rome claims to be queen of the world.          VI      We are so pious, we lovers. Discreetly we worship all powers,        Hoping for favor from each god and each goddess as well.      We are like you, ye victorious Romans, in this:  for we offer        Gods of all peoples and tribes, over the whole world, a home--      May the Egyptian, black and austere out of primeval basalt,        Or from the marble a Greek, form them charming and white--      Yet the eternal ones do not object to particularism        (Incense of most precious sort, strewn for just one of their host).      Therefore we gladly confess to singling a special immortal        And our devotions each day pledging but solely to her.      Mischievous celebrants we at these mysteries gay, and so solemn:        Silence exactly befits rites at which we're adepts.      Rather onto our heels by horrible deeds the Erinyes        We would allure, even Zeus' punishment sooner we'd dare--      Under that rock, or bound to a tumbling wheel we'd endure it--        Than we'd withdraw our hearts from the delights of her cult.      Sweet Opportunity, that is her name. You should meet her.        Often will she turn up, ever in a new form.      Daughter of Proteus might well she be whom he sired upon Thetis.        In metamorphoses they've many a hero deceived.      So now the daughter beguiles the naive and bedazzles the foolish,        Teases you while you're asleep; when you awaken, she's flown.      Eagerly yields herself up to the quick, to the active man only.        He discovers she's tame, playful and tender and sweet.      Once she appeared to me, too: a dark-skinned girl, tumbling        Over her forehead the hair down in waves heavy and dark.      Round about a delicate neck curled short little ringlets;        Up from the crown of her head crinkled the unbraided hair.      When she dashed by me I seized her, mistaking her not. Lovingly        Kiss and embrace she returned, knowing and teaching me how.      O how enraptured I was! Ah, say now no more. It's a bygone.        But, O pigtails of Rome, still I'm entrammled in you.          VII      Happily now on classical soil I feel inspiration.        Voices from present and past speak here evocatively.      Heeding ancient advice, I leaf through the works of the Ancients        With an assiduous hand. Daily the pleasure's renewed.      Throughout the night, in a different way, I'm kept busy by Cupid--        If erudition is halved, rapture is doubled that way.      Do then I not become wise when I trace with my eye her sweet bosom's        Form, and the line of her hips stroke with my hand? I acquire,      As I reflect and compare, my first understanding of marble,        See with an eye that feels, feel with a hand that sees.      While my beloved, I grant it, deprives me of moments of daylight,          She in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.      And we do more than just kiss; we prosecute reasoned discussions        (Should she succumb to sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts).      In her embrace--it's by no means unusual--I've composed poems        And the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back,      Fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.        Air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns.      Cupid, while stirring the flame in our lamp, no doubt thinks of those days when          For the triumvirs he similar service performed.          VIII      \"Can you be cruel enough to sadden me thus with reproaches?        Germans speak, I suppose, bitterly when they're in love.      Bear it I must when the gossips bring forth accusations: I'm guilty--        Or am I not? But, alas, all of my guilt was with you.      Clothes that you've given bear witness for envious neighbors          That the poor widow no more grieves for her husband alone.

As for  me, considering the way in which they were conducted, the actions, the  behaviour and the very character of the hero, I find it very difficult not  to identify the two friends as one and the same person. Arsene Lupin is  gifted with a powerful imagination and is quite capable of attributing to  himself adventures which are not his at all and of disowning those which  are really his. The reader will judge for himself.    M. L.

Leaning forward, she saw a rather fat man looking up at her out of a gross  red face with its cheeks and chin set in unpleasantly fair whiskers.    \"Well?\" he asked.    \"Well, I had a great argument with my uncle and aunt last night. They  absolutely refuse to sign the document of which my lawyer sent them the  draft, or to restore the dowry squandered by my husband.\"    \"But your uncle is responsible by the terms of the marriage-settlement.\"    \"No matter. He refuses.\"    \"Well, what do you propose to do?\"    \"Are you still determined to run away with me?\" she asked, with a laugh.    \"More so than ever.\"    \"Your intentions are strictly honourable, remember!\"    \"Just as you please. You know that I am madly in love with you.\"    \"Unfortunately I am not madly in love with you!\"    \"Then what made you choose me?\"    \"Chance. I was bored. I was growing tired of my humdrum existence. So I'm  ready to run risks.... Here's my luggage: catch!\"    She let down from the window a couple of large leather kit-bags. Rossigny  caught them in his arms.    \"The die is cast,\" she whispered. \"Go and wait for me with your car at the  If cross-roads. I shall come on horseback.\"    \"Hang it, I can't run off with your horse!\"    \"He will go home by himself.\"    \"Capital!... Oh, by the way....\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Who is this Prince Renine, who's been here the last three days and whom  nobody seems to know?\"    \"I don't know much about him. My uncle met him at a friend's shoot and  asked him here to stay.\"    \"You seem to have made a great impression on him. You went for a long ride  with him yesterday. He's a man I don't care for.\"    \"In two hours I shall have left the house in your company. The scandal will  cool him off.... Well, we've talked long enough. We have no time to lose.\"    For a few minutes she stood watching the fat man bending under the weight  of her traps as he moved away in the shelter of an empty avenue. Then she  closed the window.    Outside, in the park, the huntsmen's horns were sounding the reveille. The  hounds burst into frantic baying. It was the opening day of the hunt that  morning at the Chateau de la Mareze, where, every year, in the first week  in September, the Comte d'Aigleroche, a mighty hunter before the Lord,  and his countess were accustomed to invite a few personal friends and the  neighbouring landowners.    Hortense slowly finished dressing, put on a riding-habit, which  revealed the lines of her supple figure, and a wide-brimmed felt hat,  which encircled her lovely face and auburn hair, and sat down to her  writing-desk, at which she wrote to her uncle, M. d'Aigleroche, a farewell  letter to be delivered to him that evening. It was a difficult letter to  word; and, after beginning it several times, she ended by giving up the  idea.    \"I will write to him later,\" she said to herself, \"when his anger has  cooled down.\"    And she went downstairs to the dining-room.    Enormous logs were blazing in the hearth of the lofty room. The walls were  hung with trophies of rifles and shotguns. The guests were flocking in from  every side, shaking hands with the Comte d'Aigleroche, one of those typical  country squires, heavily and powerfully built, who lives only for hunting  and shooting. He was standing before the fire, with a large glass of old  brandy in his hand, drinking the health of each new arrival.    Hortense kissed him absently:    \"What, uncle! You who are usually so sober!\"    \"Pooh!\" he said. \"A man may surely indulge himself a little once a  year!...\"    \"Aunt will give you a scolding!\"    \"Your aunt has one of her sick headaches and is not coming down. Besides,\"  he added, gruffly, \"it is not her business ... and still less is it yours,  my dear child.\"    Prince Renine came up to Hortense. He was a young man, very smartly  dressed, with a narrow and rather pale face, whose eyes held by turns  the gentlest and the harshest, the most friendly and the most satirical  expression. He bowed to her, kissed her hand and said:    \"May I remind you of your kind promise, dear madame?\"    \"My promise?\"    \"Yes, we agreed that we should repeat our delightful excursion of yesterday  and try to go over that old boarded-up place the look of which made us so  curious. It seems to be known as the Domaine de Halingre.\"    She answered a little curtly:    \"I'm extremely sorry, monsieur, but it would be rather far and I'm feeling  a little done up. I shall go for a canter in the park and come indoors  again.\"    There was a pause. Then Serge Renine said, smiling, with his eyes fixed on  hers and in a voice which she alone could hear:    \"I am sure that you'll keep your promise and that you'll let me come with  you. It would be better.\"    \"For whom? For you, you mean?\"    \"For you, too, I assure you.\"    She coloured slightly, but did not reply, shook hands with a few people  around her and left the room.    A groom was holding the horse at the foot of the steps. She mounted and set  off towards the woods beyond the park.    It was a cool, still morning. Through the leaves, which barely quivered,  the sky showed crystalline blue. Hortense rode at a walk down winding  avenues which in half an hour brought her to a country-side of ravines and  bluffs intersected by the high-road.    She stopped. There was not a sound. Rossigny must have stopped his engine  and concealed the car in the thickets around the If cross-roads.    She was five hundred yards at most from that circular space. After  hesitating for a few seconds, she dismounted, tied her horse carelessly, so  that he could release himself by the least effort and return to the house,  shrouded her face in the long brown veil that hung over her shoulders and  walked on.    As she expected, she saw Rossigny directly she reached the first turn in  the road. He ran up to her and drew her into the coppice!    \"Quick, quick! Oh, I was so afraid that you would be late ... or even  change your mind! And here you are! It seems too good to be true!\"    She smiled:    \"You appear to be quite happy to do an idiotic thing!\"    \"I should think I _am_ happy! And so will you be, I swear you will!  Your life will be one long fairy-tale. You shall have every luxury, and all  the money you can wish for.\"    \"I want neither money nor luxuries.\"    \"What then?\"    \"Happiness.\"    \"You can safely leave your happiness to me.\"    She replied, jestingly:    \"I rather doubt the quality of the happiness which you would give me.\"    \"Wait! You'll see! You'll see!\"    They had reached the motor. Rossigny, still stammering expressions of  delight, started the engine. Hortense stepped in and wrapped herself in a  wide cloak. The car followed the narrow, grassy path which led back to the  cross-roads and Rossigny was accelerating the speed, when he was suddenly  forced to pull up. A shot had rung out from the neighbouring wood, on the  right. The car was swerving from side to side.    \"A front tire burst,\" shouted Rossigny, leaping to the ground.    \"Not a bit of it!\" cried Hortense. \"Somebody fired!\"    \"Impossible, my dear! Don't be so absurd!\"    At that moment, two slight shocks were felt and two more reports were  heard, one after the other, some way off and still in the wood.    Rossigny snarled:    \"The back tires burst now ... both of them.... But who, in the devil's  name, can the ruffian be?... Just let me get hold of him, that's all!...\"    He clambered up the road-side slope. There was no one there. Moreover, the  leaves of the coppice blocked the view.    \"Damn it! Damn it!\" he swore. \"You were right: somebody was firing at the  car! Oh, this is a bit thick! We shall be held up for hours! Three tires to  mend!... But what are you doing, dear girl?\"    Hortense herself had alighted from the car. She ran to him, greatly  excited:    \"I'm going.\"    \"But why?\"    \"I want to know. Some one fired. I want to know who it was.\"    \"Don't let us separate, please!\"    \"Do you think I'm going to wait here for you for hours?\"    \"What about your running away?... All our plans ...?\"    \"We'll discuss that to-morrow. Go back to the house. Take back my things  with you.... And good-bye for the present.\"    She hurried, left him, had the good luck to find her horse and set off at a  gallop in a direction leading away from La Mareze.    There was not the least doubt in her mind that the three shots had been  fired by Prince Renine.    \"It was he,\" she muttered, angrily, \"it was he. No one else would be  capable of such behaviour.\"    Besides, he had warned her, in his smiling, masterful way, that he would  expect her.    She was weeping with rage and humiliation. At that moment, had she found  herself face to face with Prince Renine,"]]]
