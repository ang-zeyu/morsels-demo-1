In the preparation of this work it has been the writer's aim to present  in it, with historical accuracy, authentic facts; to be fair and  impartial in grouping them; and to be true and just in the conclusions  necessarily drawn from them.  While thus striving to be accurate, fair,  and just, he has not thought it his duty to mince words, nor to refrain  from \"calling things by their right names;\" neither has he sought to  curry favor, in any quarter, by fulsome adulation on the one side, nor  undue denunciation on the other, either of the living, or of the dead.  But, while tracing the history of the Great Conspiracy, from its obscure  birth in the brooding brains of a few ambitious men of the earliest days  of our Republic, through the subsequent years of its devolution, down to  the evil days of Nullification, and to the bitter and bloody period of  armed Rebellion, or contemplating it in its still more recent and,  perhaps, more sinister development, of to-day, he has conscientiously  dealt with it, throughout, in the clear and penetrating light of the  voluminous records so readily accessible at the seat of our National  Government.  So far as was practicable, he has endeavored to allow the  chief characters in that Conspiracy-as well as the Union leaders, who,  whether in Executive, Legislative, or Military service, devoted their  best abilities and energies to its suppression--to speak for themselves,  and thus while securing their own proper places in history, by a process  of self-adjustment as it were, themselves to write down that history in  their own language.  If then there be found within these covers aught  which may seem harsh to those directly or indirectly, nearly or  remotely, connected with that Conspiracy, he may not unfairly exclaim:  \"Thou canst not say I did it.\"  If he knows his own heart, the writer  can truly declare, with his hand upon it, that it bears neither hatred,  malice, nor uncharitableness, to those who, misled by the cunning  secrecy of the Conspirators, and without an inkling or even a suspicion  of their fell purposes, went manfully into the field, with a courage  worthy of a better cause, and for four years of bloody conflict,  believing that their cause was just, fought the armies of the Union, in  a mad effort to destroy the best government yet devised by man upon this  planet.  And, perhaps, none can better understand than he, how hard, how  very hard, it must be for men of strong nature and intense feeling,  after taking a mistaken stand, and especially after carrying their  conviction to the cannon's mouth, to acknowledge their error before the  world.  Hence, while he has endeavored truly to depict--or to let those  who made history at the time help him to depict--the enormity of the  offence of the armed Rebellion and of the heresies and plottings of  certain Southern leaders precipitating it, yet not one word will be  found, herein, condemnatory of those who, with manly candor, soldierly  courage, and true patriotism, acknowledged that error when the ultimate  arbitrament of the sword had decided against them.  On the contrary, to  all such as accept, in good faith, the results of the war of the  Rebellion, the writer heartily holds out the hand of forgiveness for the  past, and good fellowship for the future.

Occasionally the old mate would come dressed in the latest city fashion,  and at other times in a new suit of reach-me-downs, and yet again he  would turn up in clean white moleskins, washed tweed coat, Crimean  shirt, blucher boots, soft felt hat, with a fresh-looking speckled  handkerchief round his neck. But his face was mostly round and brown  and jolly, his hands were always horny, and his beard grey. Sometimes  he might have seemed strange and uncouth to us at first, but the old  man never appeared the least surprised at anything he said or did--they  understood each other so well--and we would soon take to this relic of  our father's past, who would have fruit or lollies for us--strange that  he always remembered them--and would surreptitiously slip \"shilluns\"  into our dirty little hands, and tell us stories about the old days,  \"when me an' yer father was on the diggin's, an' you wasn't thought of,  my boy.\"    Sometimes the old mate would stay over Sunday, and in the forenoon or  after dinner he and father would take a walk amongst the deserted shafts  of Sapling Gully or along Quartz Ridge, and criticize old ground, and  talk of past diggers' mistakes, and second bottoms, and feelers, and  dips, and leads--also outcrops--and absently pick up pieces of quartz  and slate, rub them on their sleeves, look at them in an abstracted  manner, and drop them again; and they would talk of some old lead they  had worked on: \"Hogan's party was here on one side of us, Macintosh was  here on the other, Mac was getting good gold and so was Hogan, and now,  why the blanky blank weren't we on gold?\" And the mate would always  agree that there was \"gold in them ridges and gullies yet, if a man only  had the money behind him to git at it.\" And then perhaps the guv'nor  would show him a spot where he intended to put down a shaft some  day--the old man was always thinking of putting down a shaft. And these  two old fifty-niners would mooch round and sit on their heels on the  sunny mullock heaps and break clay lumps between their hands, and lay  plans for the putting down of shafts, and smoke, till an urchin was sent  to \"look for his father and Mr So-and-so, and tell 'em to come to their  dinner.\"    And again--mostly in the fresh of the morning--they would hang about the  fences on the selection and review the live stock: five dusty skeletons  of cows, a hollow-sided calf or two, and one shocking piece of equine  scenery--which, by the way, the old mate always praised. But the  selector's heart was not in farming nor on selections--it was far away  with the last new rush in Western Australia or Queensland, or perhaps  buried in the worked-out ground of Tambaroora, Married Man's Creek, or  Araluen; and by-and-by the memory of some half-forgotten reef or lead  or Last Chance, Nil Desperandum, or Brown Snake claim would take their  thoughts far back and away from the dusty patch of sods and struggling  sprouts called the crop, or the few discouraged, half-dead slips which  comprised the orchard. Then their conversation would be pointed with  many Golden Points, Bakery Hill, Deep Creeks, Maitland Bars, Specimen  Flats, and Chinamen's Gullies. And so they'd yarn till the youngster  came to tell them that \"Mother sez the breakfus is gettin' cold,\" and  then the old mate would rouse himself and stretch and say, \"Well, we  mustn't keep the missus waitin', Tom!\"    And, after tea, they would sit on a log of the wood-heap, or the edge  of the veranda--that is, in warm weather--and yarn about Ballarat and  Bendigo--of the days when we spoke of being on a place oftener than at  it: _on_ Ballarat, _on_ Gulgong, _on_ Lambing Flat, on _Creswick_--and  they would use the definite article before the names, as: \"on The Turon;  The Lachlan; The Home Rule; The Canadian Lead.\" Then again they'd  yarn of old mates, such as Tom Brook, Jack Henright, and poor Martin  Ratcliffe--who was killed in his golden hole--and of other men whom  they didn't seem to have known much about, and who went by the names of  \"Adelaide Adolphus,\" \"Corney George,\" and other names which might have  been more or less applicable.    And sometimes they'd get talking, low and mysterious like, about \"Th'  Eureka Stockade;\" and if we didn't understand and asked questions, \"what  was the Eureka Stockade?\" or \"what did they do it for?\" father'd say:  \"Now, run away, sonny, and don't bother; me and Mr So-and-so want to  talk.\" Father had the mark of a hole on his leg, which he said he got  through a gun accident when a boy, and a scar on his side, that we saw  when he was in swimming with us; he said he got that in an accident in a  quartz-crushing machine. Mr So-and-so had a big scar on the side of his  forehead that was caused by a pick accidentally slipping out of a loop  in the rope, and falling down a shaft where he was working. But how was  it they talked low, and their eyes brightened up, and they didn't look  at each other, but away over sunset, and had to get up and walk about,  and take a stroll in the cool of the evening when they talked about  Eureka?    And, again they'd talk lower and more mysterious like, and perhaps  mother would be passing the wood-heap and catch a word, and asked:    \"Who was she, Tom?\"    And Tom--father--would say:    \"Oh, you didn't know her, Mary; she belonged to a family Bill knew at  home.\"    And Bill would look solemn till mother had gone, and then they would  smile a quiet smile, and stretch and say, \"Ah, well!\" and start  something else.    They had yarns for the fireside, too, some of those old mates of our  father's, and one of them would often tell how a girl--a queen of the  diggings--was married, and had her wedding-ring made out of the gold  of that field; and how the diggers weighed their gold with the new  wedding-ring--for luck--by hanging the ring on the hook of the scales  and attaching their chamois-leather gold bags to it (whereupon she  boasted that four hundred ounces of the precious metal passed through  her wedding-ring); and how they lowered the young bride, blindfolded,  down a golden hole in a big bucket, and got her to point out the drive  from which the gold came that her ring was made out of. The point of  this story seems to have been lost--or else we forget it--but it was  characteristic. Had the girl been lowered down a duffer, and asked to  point out the way to the gold, and had she done so successfully, there  would have been some sense in it.    And they would talk of King, and Maggie Oliver, and G. V. Brooke, and  others, and remember how the diggers went five miles out to meet the  coach that brought the girl actress, and took the horses out and brought  her in in triumph, and worshipped her, and sent her off in glory, and  threw nuggets into her lap. And how she stood upon the box-seat and tore  her sailor hat to pieces, and threw the fragments amongst the crowd; and  how the diggers fought for the bits and thrust them inside their shirt  bosoms; and how she broke down and cried, and could in her turn have  worshipped those men--loved them, every one. They were boys all, and  gentlemen all. There were college men, artists, poets, musicians,  journalists--Bohemians all. Men from all the lands and one. They  understood art--and poverty was dead.    And perhaps the old mate would say slyly, but with a sad, quiet smile:    \"Have you got that bit of straw yet, Tom?\"    Those old mates had each three pasts behind them. The two they told each  other when they became mates, and the one they had shared.    And when the visitor had gone by the coach we noticed that the old man  would"]]]
