THE STORY OF BURNT NJAL      1. OF FIDDLE MORD    There was a man named Mord whose surname was Fiddle; he was the  son of Sigvat the Red, and he dwelt at the \"Vale\" in the  Rangrivervales.  He was a mighty chief, and a great taker up of  suits, and so great a lawyer that no judgments were thought  lawful unless he had a hand in them.  He had an only daughter,  named Unna.  She was a fair, courteous, and gifted woman, and  that was thought the best match in all the Rangrivervales.    Now the story turns westward to the Broadfirth dales, where, at  Hauskuldstede, in Laxriverdale, dwelt a man named Hauskuld, who  was Dalakoll's son, and his mother's name was Thorgerda.(1)  He  had a brother named Hrut, who dwelt at Hrutstede; he was of the  same mother as Hauskuld, but his father's name was Heriolf.  Hrut  was handsome, tall and strong, well skilled in arms, and mild of  temper; he was one of the wisest of men -- stern towards his  foes, but a good counsellor on great matters.  It happened once  that Hauskuld bade his friends to a feast, and his brother Hrut  was there, and sat next him.  Hauskuld had a daughter named  Hallgerda, who was playing on the floor with some other girls.  She was fair of face and tall of growth, and her hair was as soft  as silk; it was so long, too, that it came down to her waist.  Hauskuld called out to her, \"Come hither to me, daughter.\"  So  she went up to him, and he took her by the chin, and kissed her;  and after that she went away.    Then Hauskuld said to Hrut, \"What dost thou think of this maiden?  Is she not fair?\"  Hrut held his peace.  Hauskuld said the same  thing to him a second time, and then Hrut answered, \"Fair enough  is this maid, and many will smart for it, but this I know not,  whence thief's eyes have come into our race.\"  Then Hauskuld was  wroth, and for a time the brothers saw little of each other.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  Thorgerda was daughter of Thorstein the Red who was Olaf the       White's son, Ingialld's son, Helgi's son.  Ingialld's mother       was Thora, daughter of Sigurd Snake-i'-the-eye, who was       Ragnar Hairybreek's son.  And the Deeply-wealthy was       Thorstein the Red's mother; she was daughter of Kettle       Flatnose, who was Bjorn Boun's son, Grim's son, Lord of Sogn       in Norway.        2. HRUT WOOS UNNA    It happened once that those brothers, Hauskuld and Hrut, rode to  the Althing, and there was much people at it.  Then Hauskuld said  to Hrut, \"One thing I wish, brother, and that is, that thou  wouldst better thy lot and woo thyself a wife.\"    Hrut answered, \"That has been long on my mind, though there  always seemed to be two sides to the matter; but now I will do as  thou wishest; whither shall we turn our eyes?\"    Hauskuld answered, \"Here now are many chiefs at the Thing, and  there is plenty of choice, but I have already set my eyes on a  spot where a match lies made to thy hand.  The woman's name is  Unna, and she is a daughter of Fiddle Mord, one of the wisest of  men.  He is here at the Thing and his daughter too, and thou  mayest see her if it pleases thee.\"    Now the next day, when men were going to the High Court, they saw  some well-dressed women standing outside the booths of the men  from the Rangrivervales.  Then Hauskuld said to Hrut \"Yonder now  is Unna, of whom I spoke; what thinkest thou of her?\"    \"Well,\" answered Hrut; \"but yet I do not know whether we should  get on well together.\"    After that they went to the High Court, where Fiddle Mord was  laying down the law as was his wont, and after he had done he  went home to his booth.    Then Hauskuld and Hrut rose, and went to Mord's booth.  They went  in and found Mord sitting in the innermost part of the booth, and  they bade him \"Good-day.\"  He rose to meet them, and took  Hauskuld by the hand and made him sit down by his side, and Hrut  sat next to Hauskuld.  So after they had talked much of this and  that, at last Hauskuld said, \"I have a bargain to speak to thee  about; Hrut wishes to become thy son-in-law, and buy thy  daughter, and I, for my part, will not be sparing in the matter.\"    Mord answered, \"I know that thou art a great chief, but thy  brother is unknown to me.\"    \"He is a better man than I,\" answered Hauskuld.    \"Thou wilt need to lay down a large sum with him, for she is heir  to all I leave behind me,\" said Mord.    \"There is no need,\" said Hauskuld, \"to wait long before thou  hearest what I give my word he shall have.  He shall have  Kamness and Hrutstede, up as far as Thrandargil, and a trading-  ship beside, now on her voyage.\"    Then said Hrut to Mord, \"Bear in mind, now, husband, that my  brother has praised me much more than I deserve for love's sake;  but if after what thou hast heard, thou wilt make the match, I am  willing to let thee lay down the terms thyself.\"    Mord answered, \"I have thought over the terms; she shall have  sixty hundreds down, and this sum shall be increased by a third  more in thine house, but if ye two have heirs, ye shall go halves  in the goods.\"    Then said Hrut, \"I agree to these terms, and now let us take  witness.\"  After that they stood up and shook hands, and Mord  betrothed his daughter Unna to Hrut, and the bridal feast was to  be at Mord's house, half a month after Midsummer.    Now both sides ride home from the Thing, and Hauskuld and Hrut  ride westward by Hallbjorn's beacon.  Then Thiostolf, the son of  Bjorn Gullbera of Reykriverdale, rode to meet them, and told them  how a ship had come out from Norway to the White River, and how  aboard of her was Auzur Hrut's father's brother, and he wished  Hrut to come to him as soon as ever he could.  When Hrut heard  this, he asked Hauskuld to go with him to the ship, so Hauskuld  went with his brother, and when they reached the ship, Hrut gave  his kinsman Auzur a kind and hearty welcome.  Auzur asked them  into his booth to drink, so their horses were unsaddled, and they  went in and drank, and while they were drinking, Hrut said to  Auzur, \"Now, kinsman, thou must ride west with me, and stay with  me this winter.\"    \"That cannot be, kinsman, for I have to tell thee the death of  thy brother Eyvind, and he has left thee his heir at the Gula  Thing, and now thy foes will seize thy heritage, unless thou  comest to claim it.\"    \"What's to be done now, brother?\" said Hrut to Hauskuld, \"for  this seems a hard matter, coming just as I have fixed my bridal  day.\"    \"Thou must ride south,\" said Hauskuld, \"and see Mord, and ask him  to change the bargain which ye two have made, and to let his  daughter sit for thee three winters as thy betrothed, but I will  ride home and bring down thy wares to the ship.\"    Then said Hrut, \"My wish is that thou shouldest take meal and  timber, and whatever else thou needest out of the lading.\"  So  Hrut had his horses brought out, and he rode south, while  Hauskuld rode home west.  Hrut came east to the Rangrivervales to  Mord, and had a good welcome, and he told Mord all his business,  and asked his advice what he should do.    \"How much money is this heritage,\" asked Mord, and Hrut said it  would come to a hundred marks, if he got it all.    \"Well,\" said Mord, \"that is much when set against what I shall  leave behind me, and thou shalt go for it, if thou wilt.\"    After that they broke their bargain, and Unna was to sit waiting  for Hrut three years as his betrothed.  Now Hrut rides back to  the ship, and stays by her during the summer, till she was ready  to sail, and Hauskuld brought down all Hrut's wares and money to  the ship, and Hrut placed all his other property in Hauskuld's  hands to keep for him while he was away.  Then Hauskuld rode home  to his house, and a little while after they got a fair wind and  sail away to sea.  They were out three weeks, and the first land  they made was Hern, near Bergen, and so sail eastward to the Bay.        3. HRUT AND GUNNHILLDA, KING'S MOTHER    At that time Harold Grayfell reigned in Norway; he was the son of  Eric Bloodaxe, who was the son of Harold Fair-hair; his mother's  name was Gunnhillda, a daughter of Auzur Toti, and they had their  abode east, at the King's Crag.  Now the news was spread, how a  ship had come thither east into the Bay, and as soon as  Gunnhillda heard of it, she asked what men from Iceland were  abroad, and they told her Hrut was the man's name, Auzur's  brother's son.  Then Gunnhillda said, \"I see plainly that he  means to claim his heritage, but there is a man named Soti, who  has laid his hands on it.\"    After that she called her waiting-man, whose name was Augmund,  and said, \"I am going to send thee to the Bay to find out Auzur  and Hrut, and tell them that I ask them both to spend this winter  with me.  Say, too, that I will be their friend, and if Hrut will  carry out my counsel, I will see after his suit, and anything  else he takes in hand, and I will speak a good word, too, for him  to the king.\"    After that he set off and found them; and as soon as they knew  that he was Gunnhillda's servant, they gave him good welcome.  He  took them aside and told them his errand, and after that they  talked over their plans by themselves.  Then Auzur said to Hrut,  \"Methinks, kinsman, here is little need for long talk, our plans  are ready made for us; for I know Gunnhillda's temper; as soon as  ever we say we will not go to her she will drive us out of the  land, and take all our goods by force; but if we go to her, then  she will do us such honour as she has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#1)"],[1,"Fair      by    William Makepeace Thackeray          BEFORE THE CURTAIN    As the manager of the Performance sits before the curtain on the boards  and looks into the Fair, a feeling of profound melancholy comes over  him in his survey of the bustling place. There is a great quantity of  eating and drinking, making love and jilting, laughing and the  contrary, smoking, cheating, fighting, dancing and fiddling; there are  bullies pushing about, bucks ogling the women, knaves picking pockets,  policemen on the look-out, quacks (OTHER quacks, plague take them!)  bawling in front of their booths, and yokels looking up at the  tinselled dancers and poor old rouged tumblers, while the  light-fingered folk are operating upon their pockets behind. Yes, this  is VANITY FAIR; not a moral place certainly; nor a merry one, though  very noisy.  Look at the faces of the actors and buffoons when they  come off from their business; and Tom Fool washing the paint off his  cheeks before he sits down to dinner with his wife and the little Jack  Puddings behind the canvas.   The curtain will be up presently, and he  will be turning over head and heels, and crying, \"How are you?\"    A man with a reflective turn of mind, walking through an exhibition of  this sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by his own or other  people's hilarity.   An episode of humour or kindness touches and  amuses him here and there--a pretty child looking at a gingerbread  stall; a pretty girl blushing whilst her lover talks to her and chooses  her fairing; poor Tom Fool, yonder behind the waggon, mumbling his bone  with the honest family which lives by his tumbling; but the general  impression is one more melancholy than mirthful.  When you come home  you sit down in a sober, contemplative, not uncharitable frame of mind,  and apply yourself to your books or your business.    I have no other moral than this to tag to the present story of \"Vanity  Fair.\" Some people consider Fairs immoral altogether, and eschew such,  with their servants and families: very likely they are right.  But  persons who think otherwise, and are of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a  sarcastic mood, may perhaps like to step in for half an hour, and look  at the performances. There are scenes of all sorts; some dreadful  combats, some grand and lofty horse-riding, some scenes of high life,  and some of very middling indeed; some love-making for the sentimental,  and some light comic business; the whole accompanied by appropriate  scenery and brilliantly illuminated with the Author's own candles.    What more has the Manager of the Performance to say?--To acknowledge  the kindness with which it has been received in all the principal towns  of England through which the Show has passed, and where it has been  most favourably noticed by the respected conductors of the public  Press, and by the Nobility and Gentry.  He is proud to think that his  Puppets have given satisfaction to the very best company in this  empire.  The famous little Becky Puppet has been pronounced to be  uncommonly flexible in the joints, and lively on the wire; the Amelia  Doll, though it has had a smaller circle of admirers, has yet been  carved and dressed with the greatest care by the artist; the Dobbin  Figure, though apparently clumsy, yet dances in a very amusing and  natural manner; the Little Boys' Dance has been liked by some; and  please to remark the richly dressed figure of the Wicked Nobleman, on  which no expense has been spared, and which Old Nick will fetch away at  the end of this singular performance.    And with this, and a profound bow to his patrons, the Manager retires,  and the curtain rises.

A black  servant, who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his  bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's  shining brass plate, and as he pulled the bell at least a score of  young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately  old brick house.  Nay, the acute observer might have recognized the  little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising  over some geranium pots in the window of that lady's own drawing-room.    \"It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,\" said Miss Jemima. \"Sambo, the  black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman has a new red  waistcoat.\"    \"Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss  Sedley's departure, Miss Jemima?\" asked Miss Pinkerton herself, that  majestic lady; the Semiramis of Hammersmith, the friend of Doctor  Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself.    \"The girls were up at four this morning, packing her trunks, sister,\"  replied Miss Jemima; \"we have made her a bow-pot.\"    \"Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel.\"    \"Well, a booky as big almost as a haystack; I have put up two bottles  of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for making  it, in Amelia's box.\"    \"And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's  account.  This is it, is it? Very good--ninety-three pounds, four  shillings.  Be kind enough to address it to John Sedley, Esquire, and  to seal this billet which I have written to his lady.\"    In Miss Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss  Pinkerton, was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a  letter from a sovereign.  Only when her pupils quitted the  establishment, or when they were about to be married, and once, when  poor Miss Birch died of the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to  write personally to the parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's  opinion that if anything could console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's  loss, it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which Miss  Pinkerton announced the event.    In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's \"billet\" was to the following  effect:--    The Mall, Chiswick, June 15, 18    MADAM,--After her six years' residence at the Mall, I have the honour  and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Sedley to her parents, as a  young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished  and refined circle.  Those virtues which characterize the young English  gentlewoman, those accomplishments which become her birth and station,  will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Sedley, whose INDUSTRY  and OBEDIENCE have endeared her to her instructors, and whose  delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her AGED and her YOUTHFUL  companions.    In music, in dancing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery  and needlework, she will be found to have realized her friends'"]]]
