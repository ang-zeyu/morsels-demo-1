If you fellows take down what I say from time to  time in note-books, as you ought to do, you'll remember that I offered  to give anyone odds that Kay's would out us in the final. I always  said that a really hot man like Fenn was more good to a side than  half-a-dozen ordinary men. He can do all the bowling and all the  batting. All the fielding, too, in the slips.\"    Tea was just over at Blackburn's, and the bulk of the house had gone  across to preparation in the school buildings. The prefects, as was  their custom, lingered on to finish the meal at their leisure. These  after-tea conversations were quite an institution at Blackburn's. The  labours of the day were over, and the time for preparation for the  morrow had not yet come. It would be time to be thinking of that in  another hour. Meanwhile, a little relaxation might be enjoyed.  Especially so as this was the last day but two of the summer term, and  all necessity for working after tea had ceased with the arrival of the  last lap of the examinations.    Silver was head of the house, and captain of its cricket team, which  was nearing the end of its last match, the final for the inter-house  cup, and--on paper--getting decidedly the worst of it. After riding in  triumph over the School House, Bedell's, and Mulholland's, Blackburn's  had met its next door neighbour, Kay's, in the final, and, to the  surprise of the great majority of the school, was showing up badly.  The match was affording one more example of how a team of average  merit all through may sometimes fall before a one-man side.  Blackburn's had the three last men on the list of the first eleven,  Silver, Kennedy, and Challis, and at least nine of its representatives  had the reputation of being able to knock up a useful twenty or thirty  at any time. Kay's, on the other hand, had one man, Fenn. After him  the tail started. But Fenn was such an exceptional all-round man that,  as Silver had said, he was as good as half-a-dozen of the Blackburn's  team, equally formidable whether batting or bowling--he headed the  school averages at both. He was one of those batsmen who seem to know  exactly what sort of ball you are going to bowl before it leaves your  hand, and he could hit like another Jessop. As for his bowling, he  bowled left hand--always a puzzling eccentricity to an undeveloped  batsman--and could send them down very fast or very slow, as he  thought best, and it was hard to see which particular brand he was  going to serve up before it was actually in mid-air.    But it is not necessary to enlarge on his abilities. The figures  against his name in _Wisden_ prove a good deal. The fact that he  had steered Kay's through into the last round of the house-matches  proves still more. It was perfectly obvious to everyone that, if only  you could get Fenn out for under ten, Kay's total for that innings  would be nearer twenty than forty. They were an appalling side. But  then no house bowler had as yet succeeded in getting Fenn out for  under ten. In the six innings he had played in the competition up to  date, he had made four centuries, an eighty, and a seventy.    Kennedy, the second prefect at Blackburn's, paused in the act of  grappling with the remnant of a pot of jam belonging to some person  unknown, to reply to Silver's remarks.    \"We aren't beaten yet,\" he said, in his solid way. Kennedy's chief  characteristics were solidity, and an infinite capacity for taking  pains. Nothing seemed to tire or discourage him. He kept pegging away  till he arrived. The ordinary person, for instance, would have  considered the jam-pot, on which he was then engaged, an empty  jam-pot. Kennedy saw that there was still a strawberry (or it may have  been a section of a strawberry) at the extreme end, and he meant to  have that coy vegetable if he had to squeeze the pot to get at it. To  take another instance, all the afternoon of the previous day he had  bowled patiently at Fenn while the latter lifted every other ball into  space. He had been taken off three times, and at every fresh attack he  had plodded on doggedly, until at last, as he had expected, the  batsman had misjudged a straight one, and he had bowled him all over  his wicket. Kennedy generally managed to get there sooner or later.    \"It's no good chucking the game up simply because we're in a tight  place,\" he said, bringing the spoon to the surface at last with the  section of strawberry adhering to the end of it. \"That sort of thing's  awfully feeble.\"    \"He calls me feeble!\" shouted Jimmy Silver. \"By James, I've put a man  to sleep for less.\"    It was one of his amusements to express himself from time to time in a  melodramatic fashion, sometimes accompanying his words with suitable  gestures. It was on one of these occasions--when he had assumed at a  moment's notice the _role_ of the \"Baffled Despot\", in an  argument with Kennedy in his study on the subject of the house  football team--that he broke what Mr Blackburn considered a valuable  door with a poker. Since then he had moderated his transports.    \"They've got to make seventy-nine,\" said Kennedy.    Challis, the other first eleven man, was reading a green scoring-book.    \"I don't think Kay's ought to have the face to stick the cup up in  their dining-room,\" he said, \"considering the little they've done to  win it. If they _do_ win it, that is. Still, as they made two  hundred first innings, they ought to be able to knock off  seventy-nine. But I was saying that the pot ought to go to Fenn. Lot  the rest of the team had to do with it. Blackburn's, first innings,  hundred and fifty-one; Fenn, eight for forty-nine. Kay's, two hundred  and one; Fenn, a hundred and sixty-four not out. Second innings,  Blackburn's hundred and twenty-eight; Fenn ten for eighty. Bit thick,  isn't it? I suppose that's what you'd call a one-man team.\"    Williams, one of the other prefects, who had just sat down at the  piano for the purpose of playing his one tune--a cake-walk, of which,  through constant practice, he had mastered the rudiments--spoke over  his shoulder to Silver.    \"I tell you what, Jimmy,\" he said, \"you've probably lost us the pot by  getting your people to send brother Billy to Kay's. If he hadn't kept  up his wicket yesterday, Fenn wouldn't have made half as many.\"    When his young brother had been sent to Eckleton two terms before,  Jimmy Silver had strongly urged upon his father the necessity of  placing him in some house other than Blackburn's. He felt that a head  of a house, even of so orderly and perfect a house as Blackburn's, has  enough worries without being saddled with a small brother. And on the  previous afternoon young Billy Silver, going in eighth wicket for  Kay's, had put a solid bat in front of everything for the space of one  hour, in the course of which he made ten runs and Fenn sixty. By  scoring odd numbers off the last ball of each over, Fenn had managed  to secure the majority of the bowling in the most masterly way.    \"These things will happen,\" said Silver, resignedly. \"We Silvers, you  know, can't help making runs. Come on, Williams, let's have that tune,  and get it over.\"    Williams obliged. It was a classic piece called \"The Coon Band  Contest\", remarkable partly for a taking melody, partly for the vast  possibilities of noise which it afforded. Williams made up for his  failure to do justice to the former by a keen appreciation of the  latter. He played the piece through again, in order to correct the  mistakes he had made at his first rendering of it. Then he played it  for the third time to correct a new batch of errors.    \"I should like to hear Fenn play that,\" said Challis. \"You're awfully  good, you know, Williams, but he might do it better still.\"    \"Get him to play it as an encore at the concert,\" said Williams,  starting for the fourth time.    The talented Fenn was also a musician,--not a genius at the piano, as  he was at cricket, but a sufficiently sound performer for his age,  considering that he had not made a special study of it. He was to play  at the school concert on the following day.    \"I believe Fenn has an awful time at Kay's,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"It  must be a fair sort of hole, judging from the specimens you see  crawling about in Kay caps. I wish I'd known my people were sending  young Billy there. I'd have warned them. I only told them not to sling  him in here. I had no idea they'd have picked Kay's.\"    \"Fenn was telling me the other day,\" said Kennedy, \"that being in  Kay's had spoiled his whole time at the school. He always wanted to  come to Blackburn's, only there wasn't room that particular term. Bad  luck, wasn't it? I don't think he found it so bad before he became  head of the house. He didn't come into contact with Kay so much. But  now he finds that he can't do a thing without Kay buzzing round and  interfering.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Jimmy Silver, thoughtfully, \"if that's why he bowls"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#1)"],[1,"GOLD BAT            by P.

I bagged it first.\"    \"My dear chap, I've been waiting here a month.\"    \"When you fellows have _quite_ finished rotting about in front of  that bath don't let _me_ detain you.\"    \"Anybody seen that sponge?\"    \"Well, look here\"--this in a tone of compromise--\"let's toss for it.\"    \"All right. Odd man out.\"    All of which, being interpreted, meant that the first match of the  Easter term had just come to an end, and that those of the team who,  being day boys, changed over at the pavilion, instead of performing the  operation at leisure and in comfort, as did the members of houses, were  discussing the vital question--who was to have first bath?    The Field Sports Committee at Wrykyn--that is, at the school which  stood some half-mile outside that town and took its name from it--were  not lavish in their expenditure as regarded the changing accommodation  in the pavilion. Letters appeared in every second number of the  _Wrykinian_, some short, others long, some from members of the  school, others from Old Boys, all protesting against the condition of  the first, second, and third fifteen dressing-rooms. \"Indignant\" would  inquire acidly, in half a page of small type, if the editor happened to  be aware that there was no hair-brush in the second room, and only half  a comb. \"Disgusted O. W.\" would remark that when he came down with the  Wandering Zephyrs to play against the third fifteen, the water supply  had suddenly and mysteriously failed, and the W.Z.'s had been obliged  to go home as they were, in a state of primeval grime, and he thought  that this was \"a very bad thing in a school of over six hundred boys\",  though what the number of boys had to do with the fact that there was  no water he omitted to explain. The editor would express his regret in  brackets, and things would go on as before.    There was only one bath in the first fifteen room, and there were on  the present occasion six claimants to it. And each claimant was of the  fixed opinion that, whatever happened subsequently, he was going to  have it first. Finally, on the suggestion of Otway, who had reduced  tossing to a fine art, a mystic game of Tommy Dodd was played. Otway  having triumphantly obtained first innings, the conversation reverted  to the subject of the match.    The Easter term always opened with a scratch game against a mixed team  of masters and old boys, and the school usually won without any great  exertion. On this occasion the match had been rather more even than the  average, and the team had only just pulled the thing off by a couple of  tries to a goal. Otway expressed an opinion that the school had played  badly.    \"Why on earth don't you forwards let the ball out occasionally?\" he  asked. Otway was one of the first fifteen halves.    \"They were so jolly heavy in the scrum,\" said Maurice, one of the  forwards. \"And when we did let it out, the outsides nearly always  mucked it.\"    \"Well, it wasn't the halves' fault. We always got it out to the  centres.\"    \"It wasn't the centres,\" put in Robinson. \"They played awfully well.  Trevor was ripping.\"    \"Trevor always is,\" said Otway; \"I should think he's about the best  captain we've had here for a long time. He's certainly one of the best  centres.\"    \"Best there's been since Rivers-Jones,\" said Clephane.    Rivers-Jones was one of those players who mark an epoch. He had been in  the team fifteen years ago, and had left Wrykyn to captain Cambridge  and play three years in succession for Wales. The school regarded the  standard set by him as one that did not admit of comparison. However  good a Wrykyn centre three-quarter might be, the most he could hope to  be considered was \"the best _since_ Rivers-Jones\". \"Since\"  Rivers-Jones, however, covered fifteen years, and to be looked on as  the best centre the school could boast of during that time, meant  something. For Wrykyn knew how to play football.    Since it had been decided thus that the faults in the school attack did  not lie with the halves, forwards, or centres, it was more or less  evident that they must be attributable to the wings. And the search for  the weak spot was even further narrowed down by the general verdict  that Clowes, on the left wing, had played well. With a beautiful  unanimity the six occupants of the first fifteen room came to the  conclusion that the man who had let the team down that day had been the  man on the right--Rand-Brown, to wit, of Seymour's.    \"I'll bet he doesn't stay in the first long,\" said Clephane, who was  now in the bath, _vice_ Otway, retired. \"I suppose they had to try  him, as he was the senior wing three-quarter of the second, but he's no  earthly good.\"    \"He only got into the second because he's big,\" was Robinson's opinion.  \"A man who's big and strong can always get his second colours.\"    \"Even if he's a funk, like Rand-Brown,\" said Clephane. \"Did any of you  chaps notice the way he let Paget through that time he scored for them?  He simply didn't attempt to tackle him. He could have brought him down  like a shot if he'd only gone for him. Paget was running straight along  the touch-line, and hadn't any room to dodge. I know Trevor was jolly  sick about it. And then he let him through once before in just the same  way in the first half, only Trevor got round and stopped him. He was  rank.\"    \"Missed every other pass, too,\" said Otway.    Clephane summed up.    \"He was rank,\" he said again. \"Trevor won't keep him in the team long.\"    \"I wish Paget hadn't left,\" said Otway, referring to the wing  three-quarter who, by leaving unexpectedly at the end of the Christmas  term, had let Rand-Brown into the team. His loss was likely to be felt.  Up till Christmas Wrykyn had done well, and Paget had been their scoring  man. Rand-Brown had occupied a similar position in the second fifteen.  He was big and speedy, and in second fifteen matches these qualities  make up for a great deal. If a man scores one or two tries in nearly  every match, people are inclined to overlook in him such failings as  timidity and clumsiness. It is only when he comes to be tried in  football of a higher class that he is seen through. In the second  fifteen the fact that Rand-Brown was afraid to tackle his man had  almost escaped notice. But the habit would not do in first fifteen  circles.    \"All the same,\" said Clephane, pursuing his subject, \"if they don't  play him, I don't see who they're going to get. He's the best of the  second three-quarters, as far as I can see.\"    It was this very problem that was puzzling Trevor, as he walked off the  field with Paget and Clowes, when they had got into their blazers after  the match. Clowes was in the same house as Trevor--Donaldson's--and  Paget was staying there, too. He had been head of Donaldson's up to  Christmas.    \"It strikes me,\" said Paget, \"the school haven't got over the holidays  yet. I never saw such a lot of slackers. You ought to have taken thirty  points off the sort of team you had against you today.\"    \"Have you ever known the school play well on the second day of term?\"  asked Clowes. \"The forwards always play as if the whole thing bored  them to death.\"    \"It wasn't the forwards that mattered so much,\" said Trevor. \"They'll  shake down all right after a few matches. A little running and passing  will put them right.\"    \"Let's hope so,\" Paget observed, \"or we might as well scratch to Ripton  at once. There's a jolly sight too much of the mince-pie and Christmas  pudding about their play at present.\" There was a pause. Then Paget  brought out the question towards which he had been moving all the time.    \"What do you think of Rand-Brown?\" he asked.    It was pretty clear by the way he spoke what he thought of that player  himself, but in discussing with a football captain the capabilities of  the various members of his team, it is best to avoid a too positive  statement one way or the other before one has heard his views on the  subject. And Paget was one of those people who like to know the  opinions of others before committing themselves.    Clowes, on the other hand, was in the habit of forming his views on his  own account, and expressing them. If people agreed with them, well and  good: it afforded strong presumptive evidence of their sanity. If they  disagreed, it was unfortunate, but he was not going to alter his  opinions for that, unless convinced at great length that they were  unsound. He summed things up, and gave you the result. You could take  it or leave it, as you preferred.    \"I thought he was bad,\" said Clowes.    \"Bad!\" exclaimed Trevor, \"he was a disgrace. One can understand a chap  having his off-days at any game, but one doesn't expect a man in the  Wrykyn first to funk. He mucked five out of every six passes I gave  him, too, and the ball wasn't a bit slippery. Still, I shouldn't mind  that so much if he had only gone for his man properly. It isn't being  out of practice that makes you funk. And even when he did have a try at  you, Paget,"]]]
