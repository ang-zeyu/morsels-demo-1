EXTRACT OF A LETTER                                 FROM GENEVA.                              ______________    \"I breathe freely in the neighbourhood of this lake; the ground upon  which I tread has been subdued from the earliest ages; the principal  objects which immediately strike my eye, bring to my recollection  scenes, in which man acted the hero and was the chief object of  interest. Not to look back to earlier times of battles and sieges,  here is the bust of Rousseau--here is a house with an inscription  denoting that the Genevan philosopher first drew breath under its  roof. A little out of the town is Ferney, the residence of Voltaire;  where that wonderful, though certainly in many respects contemptible,  character, received, like the hermits of old, the visits of pilgrims,  not only from his own nation, but from the farthest boundaries of  Europe. Here too is Bonnet's abode, and, a few steps beyond, the house  of that astonishing woman Madame de Stael: perhaps the first of her  sex, who has really proved its often claimed equality with, the nobler  man. We have before had women who have written interesting novels and  poems, in which their tact at observing drawing-room characters has  availed them; but never since the days of Heloise have those faculties  which are peculiar to man, been developed as the possible inheritance  of woman. Though even here, as in the case of Heloise, our sex have  not been backward in alledging the existence of an Abeilard in the  person of M. Schlegel as the inspirer of her works. But to proceed:  upon the same side of the lake, Gibbon, Bonnivard, Bradshaw, and  others mark, as it were, the stages for our progress; whilst upon the  other side there is one house, built by Diodati, the friend of Milton,  which has contained within its walls, for several months, that poet  whom we have so often read together, and who--if human passions remain  the same, and human feelings, like chords, on being swept by nature's  impulses shall vibrate as before--will be placed by posterity in the  first rank of our English Poets. You must have heard, or the Third  Canto of Childe Harold will have informed you, that Lord Byron resided  many months in this neighbourhood. I went with some friends a few days  ago, after having seen Ferney, to view this mansion. I trod the floors  with the same feelings of awe and respect as we did, together, those  of Shakespeare's dwelling at Stratford. I sat down in a chair of the  saloon, and satisfied myself that I was resting on what he had made  his constant seat. I found a servant there who had lived with him;  she, however, gave me but little information. She pointed out his  bed-chamber upon the same level as the saloon and dining-room, and  informed me that he retired to rest at three, got up at two, and  employed himself a long time over his toilette; that he never went to  sleep without a pair of pistols and a dagger by his side, and that he  never ate animal food. He apparently spent some part of every day upon  the lake in an English boat. There is a balcony from the saloon which  looks upon the lake and the mountain Jura; and I imagine, that it must  have been hence, he contemplated the storm so magnificently described  in the Third Canto; for you have from here a most extensive view of  all the points he has therein depicted. I can fancy him like the  scathed pine, whilst all around was sunk to repose, still waking to  observe, what gave but a weak image of the storms which had desolated  his own breast.      The sky is changed!--and such a change; Oh, night!    And storm and darkness, ye are wond'rous strong,    Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light    Of a dark eye in woman! Far along    From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,    Leaps the lire thunder! Not from one lone cloud,    But every mountain now hath found a tongue,    And Jura answers thro' her misty shroud,    Back to the joyous Alps who call to her aloud!      And this is in the night:--Most glorious night!    Thou wer't not sent for slumber! let me be    A sharer in thy far and fierce delight,--    A portion of the tempest and of me!    How the lit lake shines a phosphoric sea,    And the big rain comet dancing to the earth!    And now again 'tis black,--and now the glee    Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,    As if they did rejoice o'er a young; earthquake's birth,      Now where the swift Rhine cleaves his way between    Heights which appear, as lovers who have parted    In haste, whose mining depths so intervene,    That they can meet no more, tho' broken hearted;    Tho' in their souls which thus each other thwarted,    Love was the very root of the fond rage    Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed--    Itself expired, but leaving; them an age    Of years all winter--war within themselves to wage.    I went down to the little port, if I may use the expression, wherein  his vessel used to lay, and conversed with the cottager, who had the  care of it. You may smile, but I have my pleasure in thus helping my  personification of the individual I admire, by attaining to the  knowledge of those circumstances which were daily around him. I have  made numerous enquiries in the town concerning him, but can learn  nothing. He only went into society there once, when M. Pictet took him  to the house of a lady to spend the evening. They say he is a very  singular man, and seem to think him very uncivil. Amongst other things  they relate, that having invited M. Pictet and Bonstetten to dinner,  he went on the lake to Chillon, leaving a gentleman who travelled with  him to receive them and make his apologies. Another evening, being  invited to the house of Lady D---- H----, he promised to attend,  but upon approaching the windows of her ladyship's villa, and  perceiving the room to be full of company, he set down his friend,  desiring him to plead his excuse, and immediately returned home. This  will serve as a contradiction to the report which you tell me is  current in England, of his having been avoided by his countrymen on  the continent. The case happens to be directly the reverse, as he has  been generally sought by them, though on most occasions, apparently  without success. It is said, indeed, that upon paying his first visit  at Coppet, following the servant who had announced his name, he was  surprised to meet a lady carried out fainting; but before he had been  seated many minutes, the same lady, who had been so affected at the  sound of his name, returned and conversed with him a considerable  time--such is female curiosity and affectation! He visited Coppet  frequently, and of course associated there with several of his  countrymen, who evinced no reluctance to meet him whom his enemies  alone would represent as an outcast.    Though I have been so unsuccessful in this town, I have been more  fortunate in my enquiries elsewhere. There is a society three or four  miles from Geneva, the centre of which is the Countess of Breuss, a  Russian lady, well acquainted with the agremens de la Societe, and who  has collected them round herself at her mansion. It was chiefly here,  I find, that the gentleman who travelled with Lord Byron, as  physician, sought for society. He used almost every day to cross the  lake by himself, in one of their flat-bottomed boats, and return after  passing the evening with his friends, about eleven or twelve at night,  often whilst the storms were raging in the circling summits of the  mountains around. As he became intimate, from long acquaintance, with  several of the families in this neighbourhood, I have gathered from  their accounts some excellent traits of his lordship's character,  which I will relate to you at some future opportunity. I must,  however, free him from one imputation attached to him--of having in  his house two sisters as the partakers of his revels. This is, like  many other charges which have been brought against his lordship,  entirely destitute of truth. His only companion was the physician I  have already mentioned. The report originated from the following  circumstance: Mr. Percy Bysshe Shelly, a gentleman well known for  extravagance of doctrine, and for his daring, in their profession,  even to sign himself with the title of ATHeos in the Album at  Chamouny, having taken a house below, in which he resided with Miss M.  W. Godwin and Miss Clermont, (the daughters of the celebrated Mr.  Godwin) they were frequently visitors at Diodati, and were often seen  upon the lake with his Lordship, which gave rise to the report, the  truth of which is here positively denied.    Among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these  anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story  by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord B., Mr. P. B. Shelly,  the two ladies and the gentleman before alluded to, after having  perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana, began  relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning  of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of  Mr. Shelly's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the  room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him  leaning against a mantle-piece, with cold drops of perspiration  trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh  him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his  wild imagination"]]]
