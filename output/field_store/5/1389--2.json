WELBY.      The school-room at Roselands was a very pleasant apartment; the  ceiling, it is true, was somewhat lower than in the more modern portion  of the building, for the wing in which it was situated dated back to  the old-fashioned days prior to the Revolution, while the larger part  of the mansion had not stood more than twenty or thirty years; but the  effect was relieved by windows reaching from floor to ceiling, and  opening on a veranda which overlooked a lovely flower-garden, beyond  which were fields and woods and hills. The view from the veranda was  very beautiful, and the room itself looked most inviting, with its neat  matting, its windows draped with snow-white muslin, its comfortable  chairs, and pretty rosewood desks.    Within this pleasant apartment sat Miss Day with her pupils, six in  number. She was giving a lesson to Enna, the youngest, the spoiled  darling of the family, the pet and plaything of both father and mother.  It was always a trying task to both teacher and scholar, for Enna was  very wilful, and her teacher's patience by no means inexhaustible.    \"There!\" exclaimed Miss Day, shutting the book and giving it an  impatient toss on to the desk; \"go, for I might as well try to teach  old Bruno. I presume he would learn about as fast.\"    And Enna walked away with a pout on her pretty face, muttering that she  would \"tell mamma.\"    \"Young ladies and gentlemen,\" said Miss Day, looking at her watch, \"I  shall leave you to your studies for an hour; at the end of which time I  shall return to hear your recitations, when those who have attended  properly to their duties will be permitted to ride out with me to visit  the fair.\"    \"Oh! that will be jolly!\" exclaimed Arthur, a bright-eyed,  mischief-loving boy of ten.    \"Hush!\" said Miss Day sternly; \"let me hear no more such exclamations;  and remember that you will not go unless your lessons are thoroughly  learned. Louise and Lora,\" addressing two young girls of the respective  ages of twelve and fourteen, \"that French exercise must be perfect, and  your English lessons as well. Elsie,\" to a little girl of eight,  sitting alone at a desk near one of the windows, and bending over a  slate with an appearance of great industry, \"every figure of that  example must be correct, your geography lesson recited perfectly, and a  page in your copybook written without a blot.\"    \"Yes, ma'am,\" said the child meekly, raising a pair of large soft eyes  of the darkest hazel for an instant to her teacher's face, and then  dropping them again upon her slate.    \"And see that none of you leave the room until I return,\" continued the  governess. \"Walter, if you miss one word of that spelling, you will  have to stay at home and learn it over.\"    \"Unless mamma interferes, as she will be pretty sure to do,\" muttered  Arthur, as the door closed on Miss Day, and her retreating footsteps  were heard passing down the hall.    For about ten minutes after her departure, all was quiet in the  school-room, each seemingly completely absorbed in study. But at the  end of that time Arthur sprang up, and flinging his book across the  room, exclaimed, \"There! I know my lesson; and if I didn't, I shouldn't  study another bit for old Day, or Night either.\"    \"Do be quiet, Arthur,\" said his sister Louise; \"I can't study in such a  racket.\"    Arthur stole on tiptoe across the room, and coming up behind Elsie,  tickled the back of her neck with a feather.    She started, saying in a pleading tone, \"Please, Arthur, don't.\"    \"It pleases me to do,\" he said, repeating the experiment.    Elsie changed her position, saying in the same gentle, persuasive tone,  \"O Arthur! _please_ let me alone, or I never shall be able to do this  example.\"    \"What! all this time on one example! you ought to be ashamed. Why, I  could have done it half a dozen times over.\"    \"I have been over and over it,\" replied the little girl in a tone of  despondency, \"and still there are two figures that will not come right.\"    \"How do you know they are not right, little puss?\" shaking her curls as  he spoke.    \"Oh! please, Arthur, don't pull my hair. I have the answer--that's the  way I know.\"    \"Well, then, why don't you just set the figures down. I would.\"    \"Oh! no, indeed; that would not be honest.\"    \"Pooh! nonsense! nobody would be the wiser, nor the poorer.\"    \"No, but it would be just like telling a lie. But I can never get it  right while you are bothering me so,\" said Elsie, laying her slate  aside in despair. Then taking out her geography, she began studying  most diligently. But Arthur continued his persecutions--tickling her,  pulling her hair, twitching the book out of her hand, and talking  almost incessantly, making remarks, and asking questions; till at last  Elsie said, as if just ready to cry, \"Indeed, Arthur, if you don't let  me alone, I shall never be able to get my lessons.\"    \"Go away then; take your book out on the veranda, and learn your  lessons there,\" said Louise. \"I'll call you when Miss Day comes.\"    \"Oh! no, Louise, I cannot do that, because it would be disobedience,\"  replied Elsie, taking out her writing materials.    Arthur stood over her criticising every letter she made, and finally  jogged her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in  her pen upon the paper, making quite a large blot.    \"Oh!\" cried the little girl, bursting into tears, \"now I shall lose my  ride, for Miss Day will not let me go; and I was so anxious to see all  those beautiful flowers.\"    Arthur, who was really not very vicious, felt some compunction when he  saw the mischief he had done. \"Never mind, Elsie,\" said he. \"I can fix  it yet. Just let me tear out this page, and you can begin again on the  next, and I'll not bother you. I'll make these two figures come right  too,\" he added, taking up her slate.    \"Thank you, Arthur,\" said the little girl, smiling through her tears;  \"you are very kind, but it would not be honest to do either, and I had  rather stay at home than be deceitful.\"    \"Very well, miss,\" said he, tossing his head, and walking away, \"since  you won't let me help you, it is all your own fault if you have to stay  at home.\"    \"Elsie,\" exclaimed Louise, \"I have no patience with you! such  ridiculous scruples as you are always raising. I shall not pity you one  bit, if you are obliged to stay at home.\"    Elsie made no reply, but, brushing away a tear, bent over her writing,  taking great pains with every letter, though saying sadly to herself  all the time, \"It's of no use, for that great ugly blot will spoil it  all.\"    She finished her page, and, excepting the unfortunate blot, it all  looked very neat indeed, showing plainly that it had been written with  great care. She then took up her slate and patiently went over and over  every figure of the troublesome example, trying to discover where her  mistake had been. But much time had been lost through Arthur's teasing,  and her mind was so disturbed by the accident to her writing that she  tried in vain to fix it upon the business in hand; and before the two  troublesome figures had been made right, the hour was past and Miss Day  returned.    \"Oh!\" thought Elsie, \"if she will only hear the others first, I may be  able to get this and the geography ready yet; and perhaps, if Arthur  will be generous enough to tell her about the blot, she may excuse me  for it.\"    But it was a vain hope. Miss Day had no sooner seated herself at her  desk, than she called, \"Elsie, come here and say that lesson; and bring  your copybook and slate, that I may examine your work.\"    Elsie tremblingly obeyed.    The lesson, though a difficult one, was very tolerably recited; for  Elsie, knowing Arthur's propensity for teasing, had studied it in her  own room before school hours. But Miss Day handed back the book with a  frown, saying, \"I told you the recitation must be perfect, and it was  not.\"    She was always more severe with Elsie than with any other of her  pupils. The reason the reader will probably be able to divine ere long.    \"There are two incorrect figures in this example,\" said she, laying  down the slate, after glancing over its contents. Then taking up the  copy-book, she exclaimed, \"Careless, disobedient child! did I not  caution you to be careful not to blot your book! There will be no ride  for you this morning. You have failed in everything. Go to your seat.  Make that example right, and do the next; learn your geography lesson  over, and write another page in your copy-book; and, mind, if there is  a blot on it, you will get no dinner.\"    Weeping and sobbing, Elsie took up her books and obeyed.    During this scene Arthur stood at his desk pretending to study, but  glancing every now and then at Elsie, with a conscience evidently ill  at ease. She cast an imploring glance at him, as she returned to her  seat; but he turned away his head, muttering, \"It's all her own fault,  for she wouldn't let me help her.\"    As he looked up again, he caught his sister Lora's eyes fixed on him  with an expression of scorn and contempt. He colored violently, and  dropped his eyes upon his book.    \"Miss Day,\" said Lora, indignantly, \"I see Arthur does not mean to  speak, and as I cannot bear to see such injustice, I must tell you that  it is all his fault that Elsie has failed in her lessons; for she tried  her very best, but he teased her incessantly, and also jogged her elbow  and made her spill the ink on her book; and to her credit she was too  honorable to tear out the leaf from her copy-book, or to let him make  her example right; both which he very generously proposed doing after  causing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

POWELL DIRECTOR      INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF MORTUARY CUSTOMS AMONG THE NORTH AMERICAN  INDIANS      BY DR. H. C. YARROW ACT ASST SU G USA      WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1880            SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY    _Washington D. C. July 8, 1880_      This little volume is the third of a series designed to promote  anthropologic researches among the North American Indians. The first  was prepared by myself and entitled \"Introduction to the Study of  Indian Languages,\" the second by Col. Garrick Mallery entitled  Introduction to the Study of Sign Language among the North American  Indians.    The following are in course of preparation and will soon appear.    Introduction to the Study of Medicine Practices among the North  American Indians    Introduction to the Study of Mythology among the North American  Indians    Introduction to the Study of Sociology among the North American  Indians    The mortuary customs of savage or barbaric people have a deep  significance from the fact that in them are revealed much of the  philosophy of the people by whom they are practiced. Early beliefs  concerning the nature of human existence in life and after death and  the relations of the living to the dead are recorded in these customs.  The mystery concerning the future love for the departed who were loved  while here, reverence for the wise and good who may after death be  wiser and better, hatred and fear of those who were enemies here and  may have added powers of enmity in the hereafter--all these and like  considerations have led in every tribe to a body of customs of  exceeding interest as revealing the opinions, the philosophy of the  people themselves.    In these customs, also are recorded evidences of the social condition  of the people, the affection in which friends and kindred are held,  the very beginnings of altruism in primitive life.    In like manner these customs constitute a record of the moral  condition of the people, as in many ways they exhibit the ethic  standards by which conduct in human life is judged. For such reasons  the study of mortuary customs is of profound interest to the  anthropologist.    It is hoped that by this method of research the observations of many  men may be brought together and placed on permanent record, and that  the body of material may be sufficient, by a careful comparative  study, to warrant some general discussion concerning the philosophy of  this department of human conduct.    General conclusions can be reached with safety only after materials  from many sources have been obtained. It will not be safe for the  collector to speculate much upon that which he observes. His own  theory or explanation of customs will be of little worth, but the  theory and explanation given by the Indians will be of the greatest  value. What do the Indians do, and say, and believe? When these are  before us it matters little whether our generalizations be true or  false. Wiser men may come and use the facts to a truer purpose. It is  proposed to make a purely objective study of the Indians, and, as far  as possible, to leave the record unmarred by vain subjective  speculations.    The student who is pursuing his researches in this field should  carefully note all of the customs, superstitions, and opinions of the  Indians relating to--    1. The care of the lifeless body prior to burial, much of which he  will find elaborated into sacred ceremonies.    2. The method of burial, including the site of burial, the attitude in  which the body is placed, and the manner in which it is investured.  Here, also, he will find interesting and curious ceremonial  observances. The superstitions and opinions of the people relating to  these subjects are of importance.    3. The gifts offered to the dead; not only those placed with the body  at the time of burial, but those offered at a subsequent time for the  benefaction of the departed on his way to the other world, and for his  use on arrival. Here, too, it is as important for us to know the  ceremonies with which the gifts are made as to know the character of  the gifts themselves.    4. An interesting branch of this research relates to the customs of  mourning, embracing the time of mourning, the habiliments, the self-  mutilations, and other penances, and the ceremonies with which these  are accompanied. In all of these cases the reason assigned by the  Indians for their doings, their superstitions, and explanations are of  prime importance.    5. It is desirable to obtain from the Indians their explanation of  human life, their theory of spirits and of the life to come.    A complete account of these customs in any tribe will necessitate the  witnessing of many funeral rites, as the custom will differ at the  death of different persons, depending upon age, sex, and social  standing. To obtain their explanations and superstitions, it will be  necessary to interrogate the Indians themselves. This is not an easy  task, for the Indians do not talk with freedom about their dead. The  awe with which they are inspired, their reverence and love for the  departed, and their fear that knowledge which may be communicated may  be used to the injury of those whom they have loved, or of themselves,  lead them to excessive reticence on these subjects. Their feelings  should not be rudely wounded. The better and more thoughtful members  of the tribe will at last converse freely on these subjects with those  in whom they have learned to place confidence. The stories of ignorant  white men and camp attaches should be wholly discarded, and all  accounts should be composed of things actually observed, and of  relations made by Indians of probity.    This preliminary volume by Dr. H. C Yarrow has been the subject of  careful research and of much observation, and will serve in many ways  as a hint to the student. The literature of the subject is vast, but  to a large extent worthless, from the fact that writers have been  hasty travelers or subjective speculators on the matter. It is strange  how much of accepted history must be rejected when the statements are  carefully criticised and compared with known facts. It has frequently  been stated of this or that tribe that mutilations, as the cutting off  of fingers and toes, of ears and nose, the pulling out of teeth, &c.,  are extensively practiced as a mode of mourning find wild scenes of  maiming and bloodshed are depicted as following upon the death of a  beloved chief or great man yet among these tribes maimed persons are  rarely found It is probable that there is some basis of fact for the  statement that mutilations are in rare instances practiced among some  tribes. But even this qualified statement needs absolute proof.    I am pleased to assure those who will take part in this work by  earnest and faithful research that Dr Yarrow will treat them  generously by giving them full credit for their work in his final  publication.    I must not fail to present my thanks to the Surgeon General of the  United States Army and his corps of officers for the interest and  assistance they have rendered.    J W POWELL          WASHINGTON, D C, _April_ 5, 1880      DEAR SIR: I have the honor to offer for your consideration the  following paper upon the Mortuary Customs of the North American  Indians, and trust it may meet with your approval as an introduction  to the study of a subject which, while it has been alluded to by most  authors, has received little or no systematic treatment. For this and  other reasons I was induced some three years since to commence an  examination and collection of data relative to the matter, and the  present paper is the outcome of that effort. From the vast amount of  material in the Bureau of Ethnology, even at the present time, a large  volume might be prepared, but it was thought wiser to endeavor to  obtain a still greater array of facts, especially from living  observers. If the desired end is attained I shall not count as lost  the labor which has been bestowed.    Very respectfully, your obedient servant,    H C. YARROW.    Maj. J. W. POWELL,    _In charge of Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution_          _The wisest of beings tells us that it is better to go to the House  of Mourning than to that of laughter. And those who have well consider  d the grounds he bad for thus his judgment will not by the title of  this book (as melancholy as it appears) be affrighted from the  perusing it.    What we read to have been and still to be the custom of some nations  to make sepulchres the repositories of their greatest riches is (I am  sure) universally true in a moral sense however it may be thought in  the literal there being never a grave but what conceals a treasure  though all have not the art to discover it I do not here invite the  covetous miser to disturb the dead who can frame no idea of treasure  distinct from gold and silver but him who knows that wisdom and virtue  are the true and sole riches of man.

Which yet Democritus assures us is buried in a deep pit or grave  and he bad reason for whereas we meet elsewhere with nothing but pain  and deceit we no sooner look down into a grave but truth faceth us and  tells us our own._--MURET          INQUIRIES AND SUGGESTIONS    upon the    MORTUARY CUSTOMS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.    BY H. C. YARROW.          INTRODUCTORY.      The primitive manners and customs of the North American Indians are  rapidly passing away under influences of civilization and other  disturbing elements. In view of this fact, it becomes the duty of all  interested in preserving a record of these customs to labor  assiduously, while there is"]]]
