THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT BY BEATRIX POTTER        ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were--  Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.    They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a  very big fir tree.    \"NOW, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"you may go into the  fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your  Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"    \"NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.\"    THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker's. She  bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.    FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down  the lane to gather blackberries;    BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's  garden and squeezed under the gate!    FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some  radishes;    AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.    BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.  McGregor!    MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but  he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \"Stop  thief!\"    PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for  he had forgotten the way back to the gate.    He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst  the potatoes.    AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think  he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a  gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It  was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.    PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were  overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great  excitement, and implored him to exert himself.    MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top  of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind  him.    AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been  a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.    MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed,  perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over  carefully, looking under each.    Presently Peter sneezed--\"Kertyschoo!\" Mr. McGregor was after him in no  time,    AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,  upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and  he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.    PETER sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright,  and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp  with sitting in that can.    After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very  fast, and looking all around.    HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for  a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.    An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying  peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the  gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not  answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.    THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became  more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor  filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she  sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as  if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to  her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.    HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he  heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter    scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he  came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first  thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards  Peter, and beyond him was the gate!    PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as  fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant  bushes.    Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.  He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside  the garden.    MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to  frighten the blackbirds.    PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the  big fir-tree.    He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the  floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy  cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the  second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a  fortnight!    I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.    His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a  dose of it to Peter!    \"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.\"    BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries,  for supper.    THE END          THE TALE OF BENJAMIN BUNNY    FOR THE CHILDREN OF SAWREY FROM OLD MR. BUNNY      ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.    He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.    A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and  beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.    AS soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the  road, and set off--with a hop, skip and a jump--to call upon his  relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.    THAT wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest sandiest hole of  all, cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter.    Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting  rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).  She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what  WE call lavender).    LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.    He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top  of his Cousin Peter.    PETER was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red  cotton pocket-handkerchief.    \"Peter,\"--said little Benjamin, in a whisper--\"who has got your  clothes?\"    PETER replied--\"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\" and described  how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and  coat.    Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin, and assured him that Mr.  McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly  for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.    PETER said he hoped that it would rain.    At this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole  calling--\"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"    Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.    THEY went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at  the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's  garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the  scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.    LITTLE Benjamin said, \"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a  gate; the proper way to get in, is to climb down a pear tree.\"    Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed  below was newly raked and quite soft.    IT had been sown with lettuces.    They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed,  especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.    LITTLE Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back  Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket  handkerchief.    They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night;  there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.    Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him.    THEN he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with  onions, as a little present for his Aunt.    Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.    BENJAMIN, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce  leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his  father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.    (The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)    The lettuces certainly were very fine.    PETER did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently  he dropped half the onions.    LITTLE Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the  pear-tree, with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the  other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under  a sunny red-brick wall.    The mice sat on their door-steps cracking cherry-stones, they winked at  Peter Rabbit and little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#1)"],[1,"PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY      By Bertrand Russell          PREFACE    In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those  problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say  something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism  seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a  larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics  much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.    I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E.  Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations  of sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards  probability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the  criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.    1912          CHAPTER I. APPEARANCE AND REALITY    Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no  reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might  not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can  be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a  straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the  study of philosophy--for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer  such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in  ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring  all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the  vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.    In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer  scrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a  great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may  believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our  present experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be  derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate  experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that  I am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I  see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out  of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun  is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot  globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's  rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an  indefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal  person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and  books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as  the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be  so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who  doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted,  and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure  that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.    To make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the  table. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is  smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound.  Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this  description, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise;  but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although  I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the  parts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts,  and some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if  I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the  apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows  that if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no  two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because  no two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in  the point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.    For most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to  the painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit  of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says  they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they  appear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions  that cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between  'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they  are. The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man  and the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's  wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more  troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.    To return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that  there is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the  table, or even of any one particular part of the table--it appears to  be of different colours from different points of view, and there is  no reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than  others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will  seem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a  man wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour  at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This  colour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something  depending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls  on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the  table, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a  normal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions  of light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions  have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid  favouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any  one particular colour.    The same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one can see  the grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked  at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and  valleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the  naked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table? We are naturally tempted  to say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in  turn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we  cannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we  see through a microscope? Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with  which we began deserts us.    The shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging  as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that  we come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we  all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different  in shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really'  rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had  two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel,  they will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator;  if they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were  longer. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table,  because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the  apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical  men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred  from what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we  move about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us  the truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the  table.    Similar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. It is  true that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel  that it resists pressure. But the sensation we obtain depends upon how  hard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press  with; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various  parts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite  property of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which  perhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any  of them. And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which  can be elicited by rapping the table.    Thus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the  same as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. The  real table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all,  but must be an inference from what is immediately known. Hence, two very  difficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at  all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?    It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple  terms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name  of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation:  such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and  so on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being  immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour,  we have a sensation _of_ the colour, but the colour itself is a  sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that _of_ which we are  immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is  plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be  by means of the sense-data--brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness,  etc.--which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have  been given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even  that"]]]
