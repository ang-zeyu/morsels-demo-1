Advertisement.    The following Work is delivered to the world as the first of a series  of performances, which the favorable reception of this will induce the  Writer to publish. His purpose is neither selfish nor temporary,  but aims at the illustration of some important branches of the moral  constitution of man. Whether this tale will be classed with the ordinary  or frivolous sources of amusement, or be ranked with the few productions  whose usefulness secures to them a lasting reputation, the reader must  be permitted to decide.    The incidents related are extraordinary and rare. Some of them, perhaps,  approach as nearly to the nature of miracles as can be done by that  which is not truly miraculous. It is hoped that intelligent readers will  not disapprove of the manner in which appearances are solved, but that  the solution will be found to correspond with the known principles of  human nature. The power which the principal person is said to possess  can scarcely be denied to be real. It must be acknowledged to be  extremely rare; but no fact, equally uncommon, is supported by the same  strength of historical evidence.    Some readers may think the conduct of the younger Wieland impossible. In  support of its possibility the Writer must appeal to Physicians and to  men conversant with the latent springs and occasional perversions of  the human mind. It will not be objected that the instances of similar  delusion are rare, because it is the business of moral painters to  exhibit their subject in its most instructive and memorable forms. If  history furnishes one parallel fact, it is a sufficient vindication of  the Writer; but most readers will probably recollect an authentic case,  remarkably similar to that of Wieland.    It will be necessary to add, that this narrative is addressed, in an  epistolary form, by the Lady whose story it contains, to a small  number of friends, whose curiosity, with regard to it, had been greatly  awakened. It may likewise be mentioned, that these events took  place between the conclusion of the French and the beginning of the  revolutionary war. The memoirs of Carwin, alluded to at the conclusion  of the work, will be published or suppressed according to the reception  which is given to the present attempt.    C. B. B. September 3, 1798.        Chapter I      I feel little reluctance in complying with your request. You know not  fully the cause of my sorrows. You are a stranger to the depth of my  distresses. Hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail. Yet  the tale that I am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your  sympathy. In the midst of my despair, I do not disdain to contribute  what little I can to the benefit of mankind. I acknowledge your right to  be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family. Make  what use of the tale you shall think proper. If it be communicated  to the world, it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit. It will  exemplify the force of early impressions, and show the immeasurable  evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline.    My state is not destitute of tranquillity. The sentiment that dictates  my feelings is not hope. Futurity has no power over my thoughts. To all  that is to come I am perfectly indifferent. With regard to myself, I  have nothing more to fear. Fate has done its worst. Henceforth, I am  callous to misfortune.    I address no supplication to the Deity. The power that governs the  course of human affairs has chosen his path. The decree that ascertained  the condition of my life, admits of no recal. No doubt it squares with  the maxims of eternal equity. That is neither to be questioned nor  denied by me. It suffices that the past is exempt from mutation. The  storm that tore up our happiness, and changed into dreariness and desert  the blooming scene of our existence, is lulled into grim repose; but  not until the victim was transfixed and mangled; till every obstacle was  dissipated by its rage; till every remnant of good was wrested from our  grasp and exterminated.    How will your wonder, and that of your companions, be excited by my  story! Every sentiment will yield to your amazement. If my testimony  were without corroborations, you would reject it as incredible. The  experience of no human being can furnish a parallel: That I, beyond the  rest of mankind, should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation,  and without example! Listen to my narrative, and then say what it is  that has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence, if,  indeed, every faculty be not suspended in wonder that I am still alive,  and am able to relate it. My father's ancestry was noble on the paternal  side; but his mother was the daughter of a merchant. My grand-father was  a younger brother, and a native of Saxony. He was placed, when he had  reached the suitable age, at a German college. During the vacations,  he employed himself in traversing the neighbouring territory. On one  occasion it was his fortune to visit Hamburg. He formed an acquaintance  with Leonard Weise, a merchant of that city, and was a frequent guest  at his house. The merchant had an only daughter, for whom his guest  speedily contracted an affection; and, in spite of parental menaces and  prohibitions, he, in due season, became her husband.    By this act he mortally offended his relations. Thenceforward he was  entirely disowned and rejected by them. They refused to contribute any  thing to his support. All intercourse ceased, and he received from them  merely that treatment to which an absolute stranger, or detested enemy,  would be entitled.    He found an asylum in the house of his new father, whose temper was  kind, and whose pride was flattered by this alliance. The nobility of  his birth was put in the balance against his poverty. Weise conceived  himself, on the whole, to have acted with the highest discretion, in  thus disposing of his child. My grand-father found it incumbent on him  to search out some mode of independent subsistence. His youth had  been eagerly devoted to literature and music. These had hitherto been  cultivated merely as sources of amusement. They were now converted into  the means of gain. At this period there were few works of taste in  the Saxon dialect. My ancestor may be considered as the founder of the  German Theatre. The modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same  family, and, perhaps, surpasses but little, in the fruitfulness of his  invention, or the soundness of his taste, the elder Wieland. His life  was spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces. They were  not unpopular, but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence. He died  in the bloom of his life, and was quickly followed to the grave by his  wife. Their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant.  At an early age he was apprenticed to a London trader, and passed seven  years of mercantile servitude.    My father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care  he was now placed. He was treated with rigor, and full employment was  provided for every hour of his time. His duties were laborious and  mechanical. He had been educated with a view to this profession, and,  therefore, was not tormented with unsatisfied desires. He did not hold  his present occupations in abhorrence, because they withheld him from  paths more flowery and more smooth, but he found in unintermitted  labour, and in the sternness of his master, sufficient occasions for  discontent. No opportunities of recreation were allowed him. He spent  all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment, or traversing narrow and  crowded streets. His food was coarse, and his lodging humble. His heart  gradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection. He could  not accurately define what was wanting to his happiness. He was not  tortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that  of others. His state was such as suited his age and his views as to  fortune. He did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or  unjustifiable rigor. In this respect he supposed the condition of  others, bound like himself to mercantile service, to resemble his own;  yet every engagement was irksome, and every hour tedious in its lapse.    In this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of  the teachers of the Albigenses, or French Protestants. He entertained no  relish for books, and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed  to delight or instruct. This volume had lain for years in a corner of  his garret, half buried in dust and rubbish. He had marked it as it lay;  had thrown it, as his occasions required, from one spot to another; but  had felt no inclination to examine its contents, or even to inquire what  was the subject of which it treated.    One Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire for a few minutes to his  garret, his eye was attracted by a page of this book, which, by some  accident, had been opened and placed full in his view. He was seated on  the edge of his bed, and was employed in repairing a rent in some part  of his clothes. His eyes were not confined to his work, but occasionally  wandering, lighted at length upon the page. The words \"Seek and ye  shall find,\" were those that first offered themselves to his notice.  His curiosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed.  As soon as he finished his work, he took up the book and turned to  the first page. The further he read, the more inducement he found to  continue, and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him  for the present to close it.    The book contained an exposition of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#1)"],[1,"OF AN AFRICAN CRUISER    Comprising Sketches Of The Canaries, The Cape De Verds, Liberia, Madeira,  Sierra Leone, And Other Places Of Interest On The West Coast Of Africa.    By Horatio Bridge    An Officer Of The U. S. Navy.      Edited By Nathaniel Hawthorne.      London: Wiley And Putnam, 6, Waterloo Place 1845    [Entered At Stationers' Hall.]          PREFACE.    The following pages have afforded occupation for many hours, which might  else have been wasted in idle amusements, or embittered by still idler  regrets at the destiny which carried the writer to a region so little  seductive as Africa, and kept him there so long. He now offers them to the  public, after some labor bestowed in correction and amendment, but  retaining their original form, that of a daily Journal, which better  suited his lack of literary practice and constructive skill, and was in  fitter keeping with the humble pretensions of the work, than a  re-arrangement on artistic principles. At various points of the narrative,  however, he has introduced observations or disquisitions from two or three  common-place books, which he kept simultaneously with the Journal; and  thus, in a few instances, remarks are inserted as having been made early  in the cruise, while, in reality, they were perhaps the ultimate result of  his reflection and judgment upon the topics discussed.    If, in any portion of the book, the author may hope to engage the  attention of the public, it will probably be in those pages which treat of  Liberia. The value of his evidence, as to the condition and prospects of  that colony, must depend, not upon any singular acuteness of observation  or depth of reflection, but upon his freedom from partizan bias, and his  consequent ability to perceive a certain degree of truth, and inclination  to express it frankly. A northern man, but not unacquainted with the slave  institutions of our own and other countries--neither an Abolitionist nor a  Colonizationist--without prejudice, as without prepossession--he felt  himself thus far qualified to examine the great enterprise which he beheld  in progress. He enjoyed, moreover, the advantage of comparing Liberia, as  he now saw it, with a personal observation of its condition three years  before, and could therefore mark its onward or retreating footsteps, and  the better judge what was permanent, and what merely temporary or  accidental. With these qualifications, he may at least hope to have spoken  so much of truth as entirely to gratify neither the friends nor enemies of  this interesting colony.    The West Coast of Africa is a fresher field for the scribbling tourist,  than most other parts of the world. Few visit it, unless driven by stern  necessity; and still fewer are disposed to struggle against the enervating  influence of the climate, and keep up even so much of intellectual  activity as may suffice to fill a diurnal page of Journal or Commonplace  Book. In his descriptions of the settlements of the various nations of  Europe, along that coast, and of the native tribes, and their trade and  intercourse with the whites, the writer indulges the idea that he may add  a trifle to the general information of the public. He puts forth his work,  however, with no higher claims than as a collection of desultory sketches,  in which he felt himself nowise bound to tell all that it might be  desirable to know, but only to be accurate in what he does tell. On such  terms, there is perhaps no very reprehensible audacity in undertaking the  history of a voyage; and he smiles to find himself, so simply and with so  little labor, acquiring a title to be enrolled among the authors of books!
