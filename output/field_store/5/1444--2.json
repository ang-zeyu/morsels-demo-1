Then he tapped his boot with his walking stick    \"Joel's gone,\" panted Phronsie, flying back    Joel swinging a big box, rushed into Dunraven Hall    \"And did we,\" cried Phronsie, \"find it out, Polly, and spoil it all?\"    \"Will you?\" asked Phronsie, looking down into their faces    \"We don't know how to tell it, Grandpapa\"    \"Now do set us to work, Joel\"    \"Oh, you don't know how I miss those boys!\"    \"And please make dear papa give her the right things\"    Charlotte, standing composedly in one corner of the hall    Alexia coolly read on, one arm around Polly    \"My dear Alexia,\" cried Miss Salisbury, quite softened, \"don't feel so\"    \"I'll not sing a note!\"    \"For shame, Polly, if the Little Brown House teachings are forgotten  like this\"    Polly turned and waved her music-roll at them    \"I'm not going to lecture you\"    \"Don't stop me,\" cried Pickering crossly    \"I'm going home,\" declared Charlotte    \"What do you say?\" cried Polly    \"Oh, Polly, are you hurt?\"    Old Mr. King drew up his chair to oversee it all    \"You come along yourself, Dobbs,\" said Joel pleasantly    \"I'll help you; I'm strong,\" said Charlotte.    \"It's so nice, everybody is getting on so well,\" said Polly    Then Phronsie glanced back again, and softly jogged the cradle    \"Why do you put your apron up there?\" asked Phronsie in gentle reproach    \"An old gentleman in my room,\" repeated Jasper, turning on the stairs    \"Good-morning,\" said Mr. Marlowe; \"business all right?\"    \"How you can sit there and laugh when Joe is in danger, I don't see,\"  exclaimed Percy irritably.    \"Well, now I have two babies,\" said Mother Fisher    \"I've always found,\" said Dr. Fisher, \"that all you had to do to start a  thing, was to begin\"    \"Phronsie, get a glass of water; be quick, child!\"    \"I think it was a mean shame!\" began Dick wrathfully    \"Oh, why did I speak?\" cried Polly over and over    \"Are you sick, Polly?\" cried Phronsie anxiously    \"Polly hasn't had all the milk,\" said Phronsie    Amy    \"Nothing can be too good for Polly Pepper!\" cried Alexia, starting  forward    He walked off, leaving Polly alone in the lane    \"My! what a sight of fish!\" exclaimed Mrs. Higby, dropping to her knees  beside the basket    \"Now, Jasper, you begin,\" cried Polly, \"and we'll tell Mamsie all about  it, as we always do when we get home\"    \"Polly, do come with us!\"    \"And you will be my own brother, Jasper,\" said Phronsie          CHAPTER I.    POLLY GIVES MUSIC LESSONS.      \"Miss Pepper--Miss Pepper!\"    Polly turned quickly, it was such an anxious little cry.    \"What? Oh, Amy Loughead.\"    Amy threw herself up against Polly's gown. \"Oh, if I may,\" she began,  flushing painfully. \"You see my brother is coming to-morrow--I've a  letter--so if you will let me.\"    \"Let you what?\" cried Polly, with a little laugh; \"go on, Amy, don't be  afraid.\"    \"You see it is just this way,\" Amy twisted her fingers together, drew  her breath hard, and rushed on nervously; \"Jack--he's my brother, you  know--promised me--I never told you--if I would only learn to play on  the piano, he'd take me to Europe with him next time, and now he's  coming to-morrow, and--and, oh! what shall I do?\"    Amy was far gone now, and she ended with a little howl of distress, that  brought two or three of the \"Salisbury girls\" flying in with  astonishment.    \"Go back,\" said Polly to them all, and they ran off as suddenly as they  had popped in, to leave Amy and the music teacher alone.    \"Now, Amy,\" said Polly kindly, getting down on her knees beside the girl  where she had thrown herself on the broad lounge, \"you must just  understand, dear, that I cannot help you unless you will have  self-control and be a little woman yourself.\"    \"You told me I would be sorry if I didn't practice,\" mourned Amy,  dragging her wet little handkerchief between her fingers, \"but I didn't  suppose Jack was coming for six months, and I'd have time to catch up,  and now--oh dear me!\" and she burrowed deeper into Miss Salisbury's big  sofa-pillow.    \"Take care!\" warned Polly, with a ready hand to rescue the elaborate  combination of silk and floss, \"it would be a very dreadful thing if  this should get spoiled.\"    Amy Loughead brought her wet cheek off suddenly. \"There isn't a single  tear on it, Miss Pepper,\" she gasped.    \"That's very fortunate,\" said Polly, with a relieved breath. \"Well, Amy  child, how can I help you?\" She sat down now, and drew the girl's hot  little hand within her own.    \"I can almost play that horrible 'Chopin,'\" said Amy irrelevantly; \"that  is, I could, if--oh Miss Pepper,\" she broke off suddenly and brought her  flushed face very near to the one above her, \"could you help me play  it--just hear me, you know, and tell me things you did, over again,  about it, if I practice all the afternoon? Could you?\"    \"This evening, do you mean?\" asked Polly, a trifle sharply.    \"Yes,\" said Amy faintly, and twisting her handkerchief. \"Oh dear me, I  know you're so tired. What shall I do?\"    \"But you don't understand,\" cried Polly, vexed with herself that she  couldn't help her annoyance from being seen. \"I shall put some one else  out if I give up my evening. I have an engagement, Amy. No, I don't see  how I can do it, child; I'm sorry.\" And then before she knew how, she  put both arms around the little figure. \"Don't cry, dear, I suppose I  must. I'll get out of the other thing. Yes, fly at Chopin, and keep your  courage up, and I'll be over at seven. Then to-morrow Brother Jack will  say 'How fine!' and off you'll go over the seas!\"    Outside, Polly, after enlisting Miss Salisbury's favor for the evening's  plan, was hurrying along the pavement, calling herself an hundred  foolish names for helping an idle girl out of a scrape. \"And to think of  losing the only chance to hear D'Albert,\" she mourned. \"Well, it's done  now, and can't be helped. Even Jasper when he hears of it, will think me  a silly, I suppose. Now to make my peace with Pickering.\"    She turned down the avenue running out from the street that had the  honor to contain \"Miss Salisbury's Boarding and Day School for Young  Ladies,\" and met face to face, suddenly, a young man, about whose joy at  meeting her, there could be no doubt.    \"Oh, Polly!\" he cried, \"here, let me take that detestable thing!\" trying  to get the music-roll out of her hand.    \"Take care how you talk against this,\" cried Polly, hugging it closer.  \"Indeed you shall not touch it, till you are glad that I am a music  teacher. Oh, I must tell you--I was on my way to your house because I  was afraid you wouldn't understand a note. I can't go to-night.\"    \"Can't go to-night?\" repeated Pickering, in his astonishment forgetting  all his manners. \"Why, Polly Pepper, what do you mean?\"    \"Why, I must give it up,\" cried Polly nervously; \"don't ask me--or  perhaps I ought to tell you, Pickering, then you'll see I can't help  myself.\" And Polly rapidly unfolded her plan for the evening, omitting  all details as to Amy's careless waste of her lessons despite all  efforts to make her practice. At the end of the recital, Pickering Dodge  came to a full pause on the sidewalk, regardless of all passers-by, and  turned a glowering face on Polly, who was forced to stand still also,  and look at him.    \"What idiocy!\" he exclaimed, \"to give up D'Albert for that ignoramus!  Polly, are you losing your senses?\"    \"I don't know,\" said poor Polly, who had lost the first flush of  enthusiasm over her plan, and to whom nothing now seemed so delightful  as the sight and sound of D'Albert and his wonderful melody. \"Well, it's  done, so don't tempt me to feel badly, Pickering.\"    \"Indeed, and it's not done,\" said Pickering angrily; \"you made the  engagement, Polly. I never knew you to break one before,\" he added  stingingly.    The tears flew into Polly's brown eyes, and every bit of color deserted  her round cheek. \"Don't call it that, Pickering,\" she implored, putting  out her hand.    \"I shall call it just what it is,\" declared Pickering, in his stiffest  fashion. \"It's a broken engagement, Polly Pepper, nothing more nor  less.\"    \"Then,\" said Polly, all her tears dried, \"I must go with you, if you  hold me to it.\" She raised her head, and looked him full in the eyes. \"I  will be ready,\" and she moved off with her most superb air, without  deigning a good-by.    [Illustration: \"WHY, POLLY PEPPER, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?\"]    \"Oh, Polly,\" cried Pickering, starting forward to overtake her, \"see  here, if you very much wish it, why, of course, Polly--Polly, do look  around!\"    \"What do you wish to say?\" asked Polly, not looking around as he gained  her side.    \"Why, of course,\" cried Pickering, his words stumbling over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: THE AUTHOR AND HIS GUIDES THREE FAITHFUL MEN]          THROUGH FIVE REPUBLICS ON HORSEBACK    BEING AN ACCOUNT OF MANY WANDERINGS IN SOUTH AMERICA      BY      G. WHITFIELD RAY, F. R. G. S. Pioneer Missionary and Government Explorer      With an Introduction by the Rev. J. G. Brown, D. D. Secretary for the  Foreign Missions of the Canadian Baptist Church      TWELFTH EDITION--REVISED    EVANGELICAL PUBLISHING HOUSE C. HAUSER, Agent CLEVELAND, OHIO, U. S. A.  1915          [Illustration: SOUTH AMERICA]          PREFACE    The _Missionary Review of the World_ has described South America as THE  DARKEST LAND. That I have been able to penetrate into part of its  unexplored interior, and visit tribes of people hitherto untouched and  unknown, was urged as sufficient reason for the publishing of this  work. In perils oft, through hunger and thirst and fever, consequent on  the many wanderings in unhealthy climes herein recorded, the writer  wishes publicly to record his deep thankfulness to Almighty God for His  unfailing help. If the accounts are used to stimulate missionary  enterprise, and if they give the reader a clearer conception of and  fuller sympathy with the conditions and needs of those South American  countries, those years of travel will not have been in vain.    \"Of the making of books there is no end,\" so when one is acceptably  received, and commands a ready sale, the author is satisfied that his  labor is well repaid. The 4th edition was scarcely dry when the  Consul-General of the Argentine Republic at Ottawa ordered a large  number of copies to send to the members of his Government. Much of it  has been translated into German, and I know not what other languages.  Even the _Catholic Register_ of Toronto has boosted its sale by  printing much in abuse of it, at the same time telling its readers that  the book \"sold like hot cakes.\" A wiser editor would have been discreet  enough not to refer to \"Through Five Republics on Horseback.\" His  readers bought it, and--had their eyes opened, for the statements made  in this work, and the authorities quoted, are unanswerable.    Seeing that there is such an alarming ignorance regarding Latin  America, I have, for this edition, written an Introductory Chapter on  South America, and also a short Foreword especially relating to each of  the Five Republics here treated. As my portrayal of Romanism there has  caused some discussion, I have, in those pages, sought to incorporate  the words of other authorities on South American life and religion.    That the following narratives, now again revised, and sent forth in new  garb, may be increasingly helpful in promoting knowledge, is the  earnest wish of the author.    G. W. R.    Toronto, Ont.          INTRODUCTION    \"Through Five Republics on Horseback\" has all the elements of a great  missionary book. It is written by an author who is an eye-witness of  practically all that he records, and one who by his explorations and  travels has won for himself the title of the \"Livingstone of South  America.\" The scenes depicted by the writer and the glimpses into the  social, political and religious conditions prevailing in the Republics  in the great Southern continent are of thrilling interest to all lovers  of mankind. We doubt if there is another book in print that within the  compass of three hundred pages begins to give as much valuable  information as is contained in Mr. Ray's volume. The writer wields a  facile pen, and every page glows with the passion of a man on fire with  zeal for the evangelization of the great \"Neglected Continent.\" We are  sure that no one can read this book and be indifferent to the claims of  South America upon the Christian Church of this generation.    To those who desire to learn just what the fruits of Romanism as a  system are, when left to itself and uninfluenced by Protestantism, this  book will prove a real eye-opener. We doubt if any Christian man, after  reading \"Through Five Republics on Horseback,\" will any longer conclude  that Romanism is good enough for Romanists and that Missions to Roman  Catholic countries are an impertinence. We trust the book will awaken a  great interest in the evangelization of the Latin Republics of South  America.    Of course, this volume will have interest for others besides missionary  enthusiasts. Apart from the religious and missionary purpose of the  book, it contains very much in the way of geographical, historical and  scientific information, and that, too, in regard to a field of which as  yet comparatively little is known. The writer has kept an open mind in  his extensive travels, and his record abounds in facts of great  scientific value.    We have known Mr. Ray for several years and delight to bear testimony  to his ability and faithfulness as a preacher and pastor. As a lecturer  on his experiences in South America he is unexcelled. We commend  \"Through Five Republics on Horseback\" especially to parents who are  anxious to put into the hands of their children inspiring and  character-forming reading. A copy of the book ought to be in every  Sunday School Library.    J. G. Brown.    626 Confederation Life Building, Toronto.          A PRELIMINARY WORD ON SOUTH AMERICA    The Continent of South America was discovered by Spanish navigators  towards the end of the fifteenth century. When the tidings of a new  world beyond the seas reached Europe, Spanish and Portuguese  expeditions vied with each other in exploring its coasts and sailing up  its mighty rivers.    In 1494 the Pope decided that these new lands, which were nearly twice  the size of Europe, should become the possession of the monarchs of  Spain and Portugal. Thus by right of conquest and gift South America  with its seven and a half million miles of territory and its millions  of Indian inhabitants was divided between Spain and Portugal. The  eastern northern half, now called Brazil, became the possession of the  Portuguese crown and the rest of the continent went to the crown of  Spain. South America is 4,600 miles from north to south, and its  greatest breadth from east to west is 3,500 miles. It is a country of  plains and mountains and rivers. The Andean range of mountains is 4,400  miles long. Twelve peaks tower three miles or more above ocean level,  and some reach into the sky for more than four miles. Many of these are  burning mountains; the volcano of Cotopaxi is three miles higher than  Vesuvius. Its rivers are among the longest in the world. The Amazon,  Orinoco and La Plata systems drain an area of 3,686,400 square miles.  Its plains are almost boundless and its forests limitless. There are  deserts where no rain ever falls, and there are stretches of coast line  where no day ever passes without rain. It is a country where all  climates can be found. As the northern part of the continent is  equatorial the greatest degree of heat is there experienced, while the  south stretches its length toward the Pole Quito, the capital of  Ecuador, is on the equator, and Punta Arenas, in Chile, is the  southernmost town in the world.    For hundreds of years Spain and Portugal exploited and ruled with an  iron hand their new and vast possessions. Their coffers were enriched  by fabulous sums of gold and treasure, for the wildest dream of riches  indulged in by its discoverers fell infinitely short of the actual  reality. Large numbers of colonists left the Iberian peninsula for the  newer and richer lands. Priests, monks and nuns went in every vessel,  and the Roman Catholicism of the Dark Ages was soon firmly established  as the only religion. The aborigines were compelled to bow before the  crucifix and worship Mary until, in a peculiar sense, South America  became the Pope's favorite parish. For the benefit of any, native or  colonist, who thought that a purer religion should be, at any rate,  permitted, the Inquisition was established at Lima, and later on at  Cartagena, where, Colombian history informs us, 400,000 were condemned  to death. Free thought was soon stamped out when death became the  penalty.    Such was the wild state of the country and the power vested in the  priests that abuses were tolerated which, even in Rome, had not been  dreamed of. The priests, as anxious for spiritual conquest as the rest  were for physical, joined hands with the heathenism of the Indians,  accepted their gods of wood and stone as saints, set up the crucifix  side by side with the images of the sun and moon, formerly worshipped;  and while in Europe the sun of the Reformation arose and dispelled the  terrible night of religious error and superstition, South America sank  from bad to worse. Thus the anomaly presented itself of the old, effete  lands throwing off the yoke of religious domination while the younger  ones were for centuries to be content with sinking lower and lower.  [Footnote: History is repeating itself, for here in Canada we see  Quebec more Catholic and intolerant than Italy. The Mayor of Rome dared  to criticize the Pope in 1910, but in the same year at the Eucharistic  Congress at Montreal his emissaries receive reverent \"homage\" from  those in authority. No wonder, therefore, that, while the Romans are  being more enlightened every year, a Quebec young man, who is now a  theological student in McMaster University, Toronto, declared, while  staying in the writer's home, that, as a child he was always taught  that Protestants grew horns on their heads, and that he attained the  age of 15 before ever he discovered that such was not the case. Even  backward Portugal has had its eyes opened to see that Rome and progress  cannot walk together, but the President of Brazil is so \"faithful\" that  the Pope, in 1910, made him a \"Knight of the Golden Spur.\"]    If the religious emancipation of the old world did not find its echo in  South America, ideas of freedom from kingly oppression began to take  root in the hearts of the people, and before the year "]]]
