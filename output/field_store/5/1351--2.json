Pauline Johnson\" which has been omitted here.]          FLINT AND FEATHER    Collected Verse    By E. Pauline Johnson        To his Royal Highness  The Duke of Connaught  Who is Head Chief of the Six Nations Indians  I inscribe this book by his own gracious permission        INTRODUCTION    IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON    I cannot say how deeply it touched me to learn that Pauline Johnson  expressed a wish on her death-bed that I, living here in the mother  country all these miles away, should write something about her.  I was not altogether surprised, however, for her letters to me  had long ago shed a golden light upon her peculiar character. She  had made herself believe, quite erroneously, that she was largely  indebted to me for her success in the literary world. The letters I  had from her glowed with this noble passion: the delusion about her  indebtedness to me, in spite of all I could say, never left her. She  continued to foster and cherish this delusion. Gratitude indeed was  with her not a sentiment merely, as with most of us, but a veritable  passion. And when we consider how rare a human trait true gratitude  is--the one particular characteristic in which the lower animals  put us to shame--it can easily be imagined how I was touched to find  that this beautiful and grand Canadian girl remained down to the  very last moment of her life the impersonation of that most precious  of all virtues. I have seen much of my fellow men and women, and  I never knew but two other people who displayed gratitude as a  passion--indulged in it, I might say, as a luxury--and they were  both poets. I can give no higher praise to the \"irritable genus.\"  On this account Pauline Johnson will always figure in my memory as  one of the noblest minded of the human race.    Circumstances made my personal knowledge of her all too slight. Our  spiritual intimacy, however, was very strong, and I hope I shall be  pardoned for saying a few words as to how our friendship began. It  was at the time of Vancouver's infancy, when the population of the  beautiful town of her final adoption was less than a twelfth of what  it now is, and less than a fiftieth part of what it is soon going  to be.    In 1906 I met her during one of her tours. How well I remember it!  She was visiting London in company with Mr. McRaye--making a tour of  England--reciting Canadian poetry. And on this occasion Mr. McRaye  added to the interest of the entertainment by rendering in a  perfectly marvellous way Dr. Drummond's Habitant poems. It was in  the Steinway Hall, and the audience was enthusiastic. When, after  the performance, my wife and I went into the room behind the  stage to congratulate her, I was quite affected by the warm and  affectionate greeting that I got from her. With moist eyes she  told her friends that she owed her literary success mainly to me.    And now what does the reader suppose that I had done to win all  these signs of gratitude? I had simply alluded--briefly alluded--in  the London \"Athenaeum\" some years before, to her genius and her  work. Never surely was a reviewer so royally overpaid. Her allusion  was to a certain article of mine on Canadian poetry which was  written in 1889, and which she had read so assiduously that she  might be said to know it by heart: she seemed to remember every  word of it.    Now that I shall never see her face again it is with real emotion  that I recur to this article and to the occasion of it. Many years  ago--nearly a quarter of a century--a beloved friend whom I still  mourn, Norman Maccoll, editor of the \"Athenaeum,\" sent me a book  called \"Songs of the Great Dominion,\" selected and edited by the  poet, William Douw Lighthall. Maccoll knew the deep interest I  have always taken in matters relating to Greater Britain, and  especially in everything relating to Canada. Even at that time  I ventured to prophesy that the great romance of the twentieth  century would be the growth of the mighty world-power of Canada,  just as the great romance of the nineteenth century had been the  inauguration of the nascent power that sprang up among Britain's  antipodes. He told me that a leading article for the journal upon  some weighty subject was wanted, and asked me whether the book was  important enough to be worth a leader. I turned over its pages and  soon satisfied myself as to that point. I found the book rich in  poetry--true poetry--by poets some of whom have since then come to  great and world-wide distinction, all of it breathing, more or less,  the atmosphere of Canada: that is to say Anglo-Saxon Canada. But  in the writings of one poet alone I came upon a new note--the note  of the Red Man's Canada. This was the poet that most interested  me--Pauline Johnson. I quoted her lovely canoe song \"In the Shadows,\"  which will be found in this volume. I at once sat down and wrote  a long article, which could have been ten times as long, upon a  subject so suggestive as that of Canadian poetry.    As it was this article of mine which drew this noble woman to me,  it has, since her death, assumed an importance in my eyes which it  intrinsically does not merit. I might almost say that it has become  sacred to me among my fugitive writings: this is why I cannot resist  the temptation of making a few extracts from it. It seems to bring  the dead poet very close to me. Moreover, it gives me an opportunity  of re-saying what I then said of the great place Canadian poetry is  destined to hold in the literature of the English-speaking race. I  had often before said in the \"Athenaeum,\" and in the \"Encyclopaedia  Britannica\" and elsewhere, that all true poetry--perhaps all true  literature--must be a faithful reflex either of the life of man or  of the life of Nature.    Well, this article began by remarking that the subject of Colonial  verse, and the immense future before the English-speaking poets,  is allied to a question that is very great, the adequacy or  inadequacy of English poetry--British, American, and Colonial--to  the destiny of the race that produces it. The article enunciated  the thesis that if the English language should not in the near  future contain the finest body of poetry in the world, the time  is now upon us when it ought to do so; for no other literature has  had that variety of poetic material which is now at the command of  English-speaking poets. It pointed out that at the present moment  this material comprises much of the riches peculiar to the Old World  and all the riches peculiar to the New. It pointed out that in  reflecting the life of man the English muse enters into competition  with the muse of every other European nation, classic and modern;  and that, rich as England undoubtedly is in her own historic  associations, she is not so rich as are certain other European  countries, where almost every square yard of soil is so suggestive  of human associations that it might be made the subject of a  poem. To wander alone, through scenes that Homer knew, or through  the streets that were hallowed by the footsteps of Dante, is an  experience that sends a poetic thrill through the blood. For it is  on classic ground only that the Spirit of Antiquity walks. And it  went on to ask the question, \"If even England, with all her riches  of historic and legendary associations, is not so rich in this  kind of poetic material as some parts of the European Continent,  what shall be said of the new English worlds--Canada, the United  States, the Australias, the South African Settlements, etc.?\"  Histories they have, these new countries--in the development of  the human race, in the growth of the great man, Mankind--histories  as important, no doubt, as those of Greece, Italy, and Great  Britain. Inasmuch, however, as the sweet Spirit of Antiquity knows  them not, where is the poet with wings so strong that he can carry  them off into the \"ampler ether,\" the \"diviner air\" where history  itself is poetry?    Let me repeat here, at the risk of seeming garrulous, a few sentences  in that article which especially appealed to Pauline Johnson, as she  told me:    \"Part and parcel of the very life of man is the sentiment about  antiquity. Irrational it may be, if you will, but never will it be  stifled. Physical science strengthens rather than weakens it. Social  science, hate it as it may, cannot touch it. In the socialist,  William Morris, it is stronger than in the most conservative poet  that has ever lived. Those who express wonderment that in these days  there should be the old human playthings as bright and captivating  as ever--those who express wonderment at the survival of all the  delightful features of the European raree-show--have not realised  the power of the Spirit of Antiquity, and the power of the sentiment  about him--that sentiment which gives birth to the great human  dream about hereditary merit and demerit upon which society--royalist  or republican--is built. What is the use of telling us that even in  Grecian annals there is no kind of heroism recorded which you cannot  match in the histories of the United States and Canada? What is the  use of telling us that the travels of Ulysses and of Jason are as  nothing in point of real romance compared with Captain Phillip's  voyage to the other side of the world, when he led his little  convict-laden fleet to Botany Bay--a bay as unknown almost as any  bay in Laputa--that voyage which resulted in the founding of a  cluster of great nations any one of whose mammoth millionaires could  now buy up Ilium and the Golden Fleece combined if offered in the  auction mart? The Spirit of Antiquity knows not that captain. In  a thousand years' time, no doubt, these things may be as ripe for  poetic treatment as the voyage of the Argonauts; but on a planet  like this a good many changes may occur"]]]
