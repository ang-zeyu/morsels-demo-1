A. Reilly, Attorney  175 E. Delaware Place  Chicago, Illinois 60611-1724  S.A.Reilly@att.net        4th Edition      Copyright (C) 2002                Preface    This was written to appreciate what laws have been in existence  for a long time and therefore have proven their success in  maintaining a stable society. Its purpose is also to see the  historical context in which our legal doctrines developed. It  includes the inception of the common law system, which was praised  because it made law which was not handed down by an absolutist  king; the origin of the jury system; the meaning of the Magna  Carta provisions in their historical context; and the emergence of  attorneys.    This book is a primer. One may read it without prior knowledge of  history or law, although it will be more meaningful to attorneys  than to others. It can serve as an introduction on which to base  further reading in English legal history. It defines terms unique  to English legal history. However, the meaning of some terms in  King Aethelbert's code in Chapter 1 are unknown or inexact.    In the Table of Contents, the title of each chapter denotes an  important legal development in the given time period for that  chapter. Each chapter is divided into three sections: The Times,  The Law, and Judicial Procedure.    The Times section sets a background and context in which to better  understand the law of that period. The usual subject matter of  history such as battles, wars, royal intrigues, periods of  corruption, and international relations are omitted as not helping  to understand the process of civilization and development of the  law. Standard practices are described, but there are often  variations with locality. Also, change did not come abruptly, but  with vacillations, e.g. the change from pagan to Christian belief  and the change to allowance of loans for interest. The scientific  revolution was accepted only slowly. There were often many  attempts made for change before it actually occurred, e.g. gaining  Parliamentary power over the king's privileges, such as taxation.    The Law section describes the law governing the behavior and  conduct of the populace. It includes law of that time which is the  same, similar, or a building block to the law of today. In earlier  times this is both statutory law and the common law of the courts.  The Magna Carta, which is quoted in Chapter 7, is the first  statute of England and is listed first in the \"Statutes of the  Realm\" and the \"Statutes at Large\". The law sections of Chapters 7  - 18 mainly quote or paraphrase most of these statutes. Excluded  are statutes which do not help us understand the development of  our law, such as statutes governing Wales after its conquest and  statutes on succession rights to the throne.    The Judicial Procedure section describes the process of applying  the law and trying cases, and jurisdictions. It also contains some  examples of cases.    For easy comparison, amounts of money expressed in pounds or marks  [Danish denomination] have often been converted to the smaller  denominations of shillings and pence. There are twenty shillings  in a pound. A mark in silver is two-thirds of a pound. Shillings  are abbreviated: \"s.\" There are twelve pennies or pence in a  Norman shilling. Pence are abbreviated \"d.\" Six shillings and two  pence is denoted 6s.2d. A scaett was a coin of silver and copper  of lesser denomination than a shilling.    The sources and reference books from which information was  obtained are listed in a bibliography instead of being contained  in tedious footnotes. There is no index to pages because the  electronic text will print out its pages differently on different  computers with different computer settings. Instead, a word search  may be done on the electronic text.

At first,  people hunted and gathered their food. They wore animal skins over  their bodies for warmth and around their feet for protection when  walking. These skins were sewn together with bone needles and  threads made from animal sinews. They carried small items by  hooking them onto their belts. They used bone and stone tools,  e.g. for preparing skins. Their uncombed hair was held by  thistlethorns, animal spines, or straight bone hair pins. They  wore conical hats of bound rush and lived in rush shelters.    Early clans, headed by kings, lived in huts on top of hills or  other high places and fortified by circular or contour earth  ditches and banks behind which they could gather for protection.  They were probably dug with antler picks and wood spades. The  people lived in rectangular huts with four wood posts supporting a  roof. The walls were made of saplings, and a mixture of mud and  straw. Cooking was in a clay oven inside or over an open fire on  the outside. Water was carried in animal skins or leather pouches  from springs lower on the hill up to the settlement. Forests  abounded with wolves, bears, deer, wild boars, and wild cattle.  They could more easily be seen from the hill tops. Pathways  extended through this camp of huts and for many miles beyond.    For wives, men married women of their clan or bought or captured  other women, perhaps with the help of a best man. They carried  their unwilling wives over the thresholds of their huts, which  were sometimes in places kept secret from her family. The first  month of marriage was called the honeymoon because the couple was  given mead, a drink with fermented honey and herbs, for the first  month of their marriage. A wife wore a gold wedding band on the  ring finger of her left hand to show that she was married.    Women usually stayed at home caring for children, preparing meals,  and making baskets. They also made wool felt and spun and wove  wool into a coarse cloth. Flax was grown and woven into a coarse  linen cloth. Spinning the strands into one continuous thread was  done on a stick, which the woman could carry about and spin at  anytime when her hands were free. The weaving was done on an  upright or warp-weighted loom. People of means draped the cloth  around their bodies and fastened it with a metal brooch inlayed  with gold, gems, and shell, which were glued on with glue that was  obtained from melting animal hooves. People drank from hollowed-  out animal horns, which they could carry from belts. They could  tie things with rawhide strips or rope braids they made. Kings  drank from animal horns decorated with gold or from cups of amber,  shale, or pure gold. Men and women wore pendants and necklaces of  colorful stones, shells, amber beads, bones, and deer teeth. They  skinned and cut animals with hand-axes and knives made of flint  dug up from pits and formed by hitting flakes off. The speared  fish with barbed bone prongs or wrapped bait around a flint, bone,  or shell fish hook. On the coast, they made bone harpoons for  deep-sea fish. The flint axe was used to shape wood and bone and  was just strong enough to fell a tree, although the process was  very slow.    The king, who was tall and strong, led his men in hunting groups  to kill deer and other wild animals in the forests and to fish in  the streams. Some men brought their hunting dogs on leashes to  follow scent trails to the animal. The men threw stones and spears  with flint points at the animals. They used wood clubs to beat  them, at the same time using wood shields to protect their bodies.  They watched the phases of the moon and learned to predict when it  would be full and give the most light for night hunting. This  began the concept of a month. Circles of stone like Stonehenge  were built with alignments to paths of the moon.    If hunting groups from two clans tried to follow the same deer,  there might be a fight between the clans or a blood feud. After  the battle, the clan would bring back its dead and wounded. A  priest officiated over a funeral for a dead man. His wife would  often also go on the funeral pyre with him.    The priest also officiated over sacrifices of humans, who were  usually offenders found guilty of transgressions. Sacrifices were  usually made in time of war or pestilence, and usually before the  winter made food scarce.    The clan ate"]]]
