I made no reply; I had just granted him a favour by allowing him to  leave the upper deck of the submarine, in order that he might await the  motor launch in some sort of privacy; why should he ask for more?    Undeterred by my silence, he continued: \"I have a great friend,  Lieutenant-zu-See Von Schenk, who brought U.122 over last week; he has  lost a diary, quite private, he left it in error; can he have it?\"    I deliberated, felt a certain pity, then remembered the _Belgian  Prince_ and other things, and so, looking the German in the face, I  said:    \"I can do nothing.\"    \"Please.\"    I shook my head, then, to my astonishment, the German placed his head  in his hands and wept, his massive frame (for he was a very big man)  shook in irregular spasms; it was a most extraordinary spectacle.    It seemed to me absurd that a man who had suffered, without visible  emotion, the monstrous humiliation of handing over his command intact,  should break down over a trivial incident concerning a diary, and not  even his own diary, and yet there was this man crying openly before me.    It rather impressed me, and I felt a curious shyness at being present,  as if I had stumbled accidentally into some private recess of his mind.  I closed the cabin door, for I heard the voices of my crew approaching.    He wept for some time, perhaps ten minutes, and I wished very much to  know of what he was thinking, but I couldn't imagine how it would be  possible to find out.    I think that my behaviour in connection with his friend's diary added  the last necessary drop of water to the floods of emotion which he had  striven, and striven successfully, to hold in check during the agony of  handing over the boat, and now the dam had crumbled and broken away.    It struck me that, down in the brilliantly-lit, stuffy little cabin,  the result of the war was epitomized. On the table were some  instruments I had forbidden him to remove, but which my first  lieutenant had discovered in the engineer officer's bag.    On the settee lay a cheap, imitation leather suit-case, containing his  spare clothes and a few books. At the table sat Germany in defeat,  weeping, but not the tears of repentance, rather the tears of bitter  regret for humiliations undergone and ambitions unrealized.    We did not speak again, for I heard the launch come alongside, and, as  she bumped against the U-boat, the noise echoed through the hull into  the cabin, and aroused him from his sorrows. He wiped his eyes, and,  with an attempt at his former hardiness, he followed me on deck and  boarded the motor launch.    Next day I visited U.122, and these papers are presented to the public,  with such additional remarks as seemed desirable; for some curious  reason the author seems to have omitted nearly all dates. This may have  been due to the fear that the book, if captured, would be of great  value to the British Intelligence Department if the entries were dated.  The papers are in the form of two volumes in black leather binding,  with a long letter inside the cover of the second volume.    _Internal evidence has permitted me to add the dates as regards the  years. My thanks are due to K. for assistance in translation_.    ETIENNE.           *       *       *       *       *    The Diary of a U-boat Commander          One volume of my war-journal completed, and I must confess it is dull  reading.    I could not help smiling as I read my enthusiastic remarks at the  outbreak of war, when we visualized battles by the week. What a  contrast between our expectations and the actual facts.    Months of monotony, and I haven't even seen an Englishman yet.    Our battle cruisers have had a little amusement with the coast raids at  Scarborough and elsewhere, but we battle-fleet fellows have seen  nothing, and done nothing.    So I have decided to volunteer for the U-boat service, and my name went  in last week, though I am told it may be months before I am taken, as  there are about 250 lieutenants already on the waiting list.    But sooner or later I suppose something will come of it.    I shall have no cause to complain of inactivity in that Service, if I  get there.           *       *       *       *       *    I am off to-night for a six-days trip, two days of which are to be  spent in the train, to the Verdun sector.    It has been a great piece of luck. The trip had been arranged by the  Military and Naval Inter-communication Department; and two officers  from this squadron were to go.    There were 130 candidates, so we drew lots; as usual I was lucky and  drew one of the two chances.    It should be intensely interesting.           *       *       *       *       *    _At_ ----      I arrived here last night after a slow and tiresome journey, which was  somewhat alleviated by an excellent bottle of French wine which I  purchased whilst in the Champagne district.    Long before we reached the vicinity of Verdun it was obvious to the  most casual observer that we were heading for a centre of unusual  activity.    Hospital trains travelling north-east and east were numerous, and twice  our train, which was one of the ordinary military trains, was shunted  on to a siding to allow troop trains to rumble past.    As we approached Verdun the noise of artillery, which I had heard  distantly once or twice during the day, as the casual railway train  approached the front, became more intense and grew from a low murmur  into a steady noise of a kind of growling description, punctuated at  irregular intervals by very deep booms as some especially heavy piece  was discharged, or an ammunition dump went up.    The country here is very different from the mud flats of Flanders, as  it is hilly and well wooded. The Meuse, in the course of centuries, has  cut its way through the rampart of hills which surround Verdun, and we  are attacking the place from three directions. On the north we are  slowly forcing the French back on either river bank--a very costly  proceeding, as each wing must advance an equal amount, or the one that  advances is enfiladed from across the river.    We are also slowly creeping forward from the east and north-east in the  direction of Douaumont.    I am attached to a 105-cm. battery, a young Major von Markel in  command, a most charming fellow. I spent all to-day in the advanced  observing position with a young subaltern called Grabel, also a nice  young fellow. I was in position at 6 a.m., and, as apparently is common  here, mist hides everything from view until the sun attains a certain  strength. Our battery was supporting the attack on the north side of  the river, though the battery itself was on the south side, and firing  over a hill called L'Homme Mort.    Von Markel told me that the fighting here has not been previously  equalled in the war, such is the intensity of the combat and the price  each side is paying.    I could see for myself that this was so, and the whole atmosphere of  the place is pregnant with the supreme importance of this struggle,  which may well be the dying convulsions of decadent France.    His Imperial Majesty himself has arrived on the scene to witness the  final triumph of our arms, and all agree that the end is imminent.    Once we get Verdun, it is the general opinion that this portion of the  French front will break completely, carrying with it the adjacent  sectors, and the French Armies in the Vosges and Argonne will be  committed to a general retreat on converging lines.    But, favourable as this would be to us, it is generally considered here  that the fall of Verdun will break the moral resistance of the French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#1)"],[1,"Team                  GLIMPSES OF BENGAL    SELECTED FROM THE LETTERS OF SIR RABINDRANATH TAGORE    1885 TO 1895    By Sir Rabindranath Tagore          INTRODUCTION      The letters translated in this book span the most productive period of my  literary life, when, owing to great good fortune, I was young and less  known.    Youth being exuberant and leisure ample, I felt the writing of letters  other than business ones to be a delightful necessity. This is a form of  literary extravagance only possible when a surplus of thought and emotion  accumulates. Other forms of literature remain the author's and are made  public for his good; letters that have been given to private individuals  once for all, are therefore characterised by the more generous  abandonment.    It so happened that selected extracts from a large number of such letters  found their way back to me years after they had been written. It had been  rightly conjectured that they would delight me by bringing to mind the  memory of days when, under the shelter of obscurity, I enjoyed the  greatest freedom my life has ever known.    Since these letters synchronise with a considerable part of my published  writings, I thought their parallel course would broaden my readers'  understanding of my poems as a track is widened by retreading the same  ground. Such was my justification for publishing them in a book for my  countrymen. Hoping that the descriptions of village scenes in Bengal  contained in these letters would also be of interest to English readers,  the translation of a selection of that selection has been entrusted to one  who, among all those whom I know, was best fitted to carry it out.    RABINDRANATH TAGORE.    _20th June 1920._          BANDORA, BY THE SEA,    _October_ 1885.      The unsheltered sea heaves and heaves and blanches into foam. It sets me  thinking of some tied-up monster straining at its bonds, in front of whose  gaping jaws we build our homes on the shore and watch it lashing its tail.  What immense strength, with waves swelling like the muscles of a giant!    From the beginning of creation there has been this feud between land and  water: the dry earth slowly and silently adding to its domain and  spreading a broader and broader lap for its children; the ocean receding  step by step, heaving and sobbing and beating its breast in despair.  Remember the sea was once sole monarch, utterly free.    Land rose from its womb, usurped its throne, and ever since the maddened  old creature, with hoary crest of foam, wails and laments continually,  like King Lear exposed to the fury of the elements.      _July 1887._    I am in my twenty-seventh year. This event keeps thrusting itself before  my mind--nothing else seems to have happened of late.    But to reach twenty-seven--is that a trifling thing?--to pass the meridian  of the twenties on one's progress towards thirty?--thirty--that is to say  maturity--the age at which people expect fruit rather than fresh foliage.  But, alas, where is the promise of fruit? As I shake my head, it still  feels brimful of luscious frivolity, with not a trace of philosophy.    Folk are beginning to complain: \"Where is that which we expected of  you--that in hope of which we admired the soft green of the shoot? Are we  to put up with immaturity for ever? It is high time for us to know what we  shall gain from you. We want an estimate of the proportion of oil which  the blindfold, mill-turning, unbiased critic can squeeze out of you.\"    It has ceased to be possible to delude these people into waiting  expectantly any longer. While I was under age they trustfully gave me  credit; it is sad to disappoint them now that I am on the verge of thirty.  But what am I to do? Words of wisdom will not come! I am utterly  incompetent to provide things that may profit the multitude. Beyond a  snatch of song, some tittle-tattle, a little merry fooling, I have been  unable to advance. And as the result, those who held high hopes will turn  their wrath on me; but did any one ever beg them to nurse these  expectations?    Such are the thoughts which assail me since one fine _Bysakh_ morning  I awoke amidst fresh breeze and light, new leaf and flower, to find that I  had stepped into my twenty-seventh year.          SHELIDAH, 1888.      Our house-boat is moored to a sandbank on the farther side of the river. A  vast expanse of sand stretches away out of sight on every side, with here  and there a streak, as of water, running across, though sometimes what  gleams like water is only sand.    Not a village, not a human being, not a tree, not a blade of grass--the  only breaks in the monotonous whiteness are gaping cracks which in places  show the layer of moist, black clay underneath.    Looking towards the East, there is endless blue above, endless white  beneath. Sky empty, earth empty too--the emptiness below hard and barren,  that overhead arched and ethereal--one could hardly find elsewhere such a  picture of stark desolation.    But on turning to the West, there is water, the currentless bend of the  river, fringed with its high bank, up to which spread the village groves  with cottages peeping through--all like an enchanting dream in the evening  light. I say \"the evening light,\" because in the evening we wander out,  and so that aspect is impressed on my mind.          SHAZADPUR, 1890.      The magistrate was sitting in the verandah of his tent dispensing justice  to the crowd awaiting their turns under the shade of a tree. They set my  palanquin down right under his nose, and the young Englishman received me  courteously. He had very light hair, with darker patches here and there,  and a moustache just beginning to show. One might have taken him for a  white-haired old man but for his extremely youthful face. I asked him over  to dinner, but he said he was due elsewhere to arrange for a pig-sticking  party.    As I returned home, great black clouds came up and there was a terrific  storm with torrents of rain. I could not touch a book, it was impossible  to write, so in the I-know-not-what mood I wandered about from room to  room. It had become quite dark, the thunder was continually pealing, the  lightning gleaming flash after flash, and every now and then sudden gusts  of wind would get hold of the big _lichi_ tree by the neck and give  its shaggy top a thorough shaking. The hollow in front of the house soon  filled with water, and as I paced about, it suddenly struck me that I  ought to offer the shelter of the house to the magistrate.    I sent off an invitation; then after investigation I found the only spare  room encumbered with a platform of planks hanging from the beams, piled  with dirty old quilts and bolsters. Servants' belongings, an excessively  grimy mat, hubble-bubble pipes, tobacco, tinder, and two wooden chests  littered the floor, besides sundry packing-cases full of useless odds and  ends, such as a rusty kettle lid, a bottomless iron stove, a discoloured  old nickel teapot, a soup-plate full of treacle blackened with dust. In a  corner was a tub for washing dishes, and from nails in the wall hung moist  dish-clouts and the cook's livery and skull-cap. The only piece of  furniture was a rickety dressing-table with water stains, oil stains, milk  stains, black, brown, and white stains, and all kinds of mixed stains. The  mirror, detached from it, rested against another wall, and the drawers  were receptacles for a miscellaneous assortment of articles from soiled  napkins down to bottle wires and dust.    For a moment I was overwhelmed with dismay; then it was a case of--send  for the manager, send for the storekeeper, call up all the servants, get  hold of extra men, fetch water, put up ladders, unfasten ropes, pull down  planks, take away bedding, pick up broken glass bit by bit, wrench nails  from the wall one by one.--The chandelier falls and its pieces strew the  floor; pick them up again piece by piece.--I myself whisk the dirty mat  off the floor and out of the window, dislodging a horde of cockroaches,  messmates, who dine off my bread, my treacle, and the polish on my shoes.    The magistrate's reply is brought back; his tent is in an awful state and  he is coming at once. Hurry up! Hurry up! Presently comes the shout: \"The  sahib has arrived.\" All in a flurry I brush the dust off hair, beard, and  the rest of myself, and as I go to receive him in the drawing-room, I try  to look as respectable as if I had been reposing there comfortably all the  afternoon.    I went through the shaking of hands and conversed with the magistrate  outwardly serene; still, misgivings about his accommodation would now and  then well up within. When at length I had to show my guest to his room, I  found it passable, and if the homeless cockroaches do not tickle the soles  of his feet, he may manage to get a night's rest.          KALIGRAM, 1891.      I am feeling listlessly comfortable and delightfully irresponsible.    This is the prevailing mood all round here. There is a river but it has no  current to speak of, and, lying snugly tucked up in its coverlet of  floating weeds, seems to think--\"Since it is possible to get on without  getting along, why should I bestir myself to stir?\" So the sedge which  lines the banks knows hardly any disturbance until the fishermen come with  their nets.    Four or five large-sized boats are moored near by, alongside each other.  On the upper deck of one the boatman is fast asleep, rolled up in a sheet  from head to foot. On another, the boatman--also basking in the  sun--leisurely twists some yarn into rope. On the lower deck in a third,  an oldish-looking, bare-bodied fellow is leaning over an oar, staring  vacantly at our boat.    Along the bank there are various other people, but why they come or go,  with the slowest of idle steps, or remain seated on their haunches  embracing their knees, or keep on gazing at nothing in particular, no one  can guess."]]]
