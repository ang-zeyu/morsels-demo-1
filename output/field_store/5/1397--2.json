Wodehouse          1      In a day in June, at the hour when London moves abroad in quest  of lunch, a young man stood at the entrance of the Bandolero  Restaurant looking earnestly up Shaftesbury Avenue--a large young  man in excellent condition, with a pleasant, good-humoured, brown,  clean-cut face. He paid no attention to the stream of humanity  that flowed past him. His mouth was set and his eyes wore a  serious, almost a wistful expression. He was frowning slightly.  One would have said that here was a man with a secret sorrow.    William FitzWilliam Delamere Chalmers, Lord Dawlish, had no secret  sorrow. All that he was thinking of at that moment was the best  method of laying a golf ball dead in front of the Palace Theatre.  It was his habit to pass the time in mental golf when Claire  Fenwick was late in keeping her appointments with him. On one  occasion she had kept him waiting so long that he had been able to  do nine holes, starting at the Savoy Grill and finishing up near  Hammersmith. His was a simple mind, able to amuse itself with  simple things.    As he stood there, gazing into the middle distance, an individual  of dishevelled aspect sidled up, a vagrant of almost the maximum  seediness, from whose midriff there protruded a trayful of a  strange welter of collar-studs, shoe-laces, rubber rings,  buttonhooks, and dying roosters. For some minutes he had been  eyeing his lordship appraisingly from the edge of the kerb, and  now, secure in the fact that there seemed to be no policeman in  the immediate vicinity, he anchored himself in front of him and  observed that he had a wife and four children at home, all  starving.    This sort of thing was always happening to Lord Dawlish. There was  something about him, some atmosphere of unaffected kindliness,  that invited it.    In these days when everything, from the shape of a man's hat to  his method of dealing with asparagus, is supposed to be an index  to character, it is possible to form some estimate of Lord Dawlish  from the fact that his vigil in front of the Bandolero had been  expensive even before the advent of the Benedict with the studs  and laces. In London, as in New York, there are spots where it is  unsafe for a man of yielding disposition to stand still, and the  corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Piccadilly Circus is one of them.  Scrubby, impecunious men drift to and fro there, waiting for the  gods to provide something easy; and the prudent man, conscious of  the possession of loose change, whizzes through the danger zone at  his best speed, 'like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in  fear and dread, and having once turned round walks on, and turns  no more his head, because he knows a frightful fiend doth close  behind him tread.' In the seven minutes he had been waiting two  frightful fiends closed in on Lord Dawlish, requesting loans of  five shillings till Wednesday week and Saturday week respectively,  and he had parted with the money without a murmur.    A further clue to his character is supplied by the fact that both  these needy persons seemed to know him intimately, and that each  called him Bill. All Lord Dawlish's friends called him Bill, and  he had a catholic list of them, ranging from men whose names were  in 'Debrett' to men whose names were on the notice boards of  obscure clubs in connexion with the non-payment of dues. He was  the sort of man one instinctively calls Bill.    The anti-race-suicide enthusiast with the rubber rings did not call  Lord Dawlish Bill, but otherwise his manner was intimate. His  lordship's gaze being a little slow in returning from the middle  distance--for it was not a matter to be decided carelessly and  without thought, this problem of carrying the length of Shaftesbury  Avenue with a single brassy shot--he repeated the gossip from the  home. Lord Dawlish regarded him thoughtfully.    'It could be done,' he said, 'but you'd want a bit of pull on it.  I'm sorry; I didn't catch what you said.'    The other obliged with his remark for the third time, with  increased pathos, for constant repetition was making him almost  believe it himself.    'Four starving children?'    'Four, guv'nor, so help me!'    'I suppose you don't get much time for golf then, what?' said Lord  Dawlish, sympathetically.    It was precisely three days, said the man, mournfully inflating a  dying rooster, since his offspring had tasted bread.    This did not touch Lord Dawlish deeply. He was not very fond of  bread. But it seemed to be troubling the poor fellow with the  studs a great deal, so, realizing that tastes differ and that  there is no accounting for them, he looked at him commiseratingly.    'Of course, if they like bread, that makes it rather rotten,  doesn't it? What are you going to do about it?'    'Buy a dying rooster, guv'nor,' he advised. 'Causes great fun and  laughter.'    Lord Dawlish eyed the strange fowl without enthusiasm.    'No,' he said, with a slight shudder.    There was a pause. The situation had the appearance of being at a  deadlock.    'I'll tell you what,' said Lord Dawlish, with the air of one who,  having pondered, has been rewarded with a great idea: 'the fact  is, I really don't want to buy anything. You seem by bad luck to  be stocked up with just the sort of things I wouldn't be seen dead  in a ditch with. I can't stand rubber rings, never could. I'm not  really keen on buttonhooks. And I don't want to hurt your  feelings, but I think that squeaking bird of yours is about the  beastliest thing I ever met. So suppose I give you a shilling and  call it square, what?'    'Gawd bless yer, guv'nor.'    'Not at all. You'll be able to get those children of yours some  bread--I expect you can get a lot of bread for a shilling. Do they  really like it? Rum kids!'    And having concluded this delicate financial deal Lord Dawlish  turned, the movement bringing him face to face with a tall girl in  white.    During the business talk which had just come to an end this girl  had been making her way up the side street which forms a short cut  between Coventry Street and the Bandolero, and several admirers of  feminine beauty who happened to be using the same route had almost  dislocated their necks looking after her. She was a strikingly  handsome girl. She was tall and willowy. Her eyes, shaded by her  hat, were large and grey. Her nose was small and straight, her  mouth, though somewhat hard, admirably shaped, and she carried  herself magnificently. One cannot blame the policeman on duty in  Leicester Square for remarking to a cabman as she passed that he  envied the bloke that that was going to meet.    Bill Dawlish was this fortunate bloke, but, from the look of him  as he caught sight of her, one would have said that he did not  appreciate his luck. The fact of the matter was that he had only  just finished giving the father of the family his shilling, and he  was afraid that Claire had seen him doing it. For Claire, dear  girl, was apt to be unreasonable about these little generosities  of his. He cast a furtive glance behind him in the hope that the  disseminator of expiring roosters had vanished, but the man was  still at his elbow. Worse, he faced them, and in a hoarse but  carrying voice he was instructing Heaven to bless his benefactor.    'Halloa, Claire darling!' said Lord Dawlish, with a sort of  sheepish breeziness. 'Here you are.'    Claire was looking after the stud merchant, as, grasping his  wealth, he scuttled up the avenue.    'Only a bob,' his lordship hastened to say. 'Rather a sad case,  don't you know. Squads of children at home demanding bread. Didn't  want much else, apparently, but were frightfully keen on bread.'    'He has just gone into a public-house.'    'He may have gone to telephone or something, what?'    'I wish,' said Claire, fretfully, leading the way down the  grillroom stairs, 'that you wouldn't let all London sponge on you  like this. I keep telling you not to. I should have thought that  if any one needed to keep what little money he has got it was  you.'    Certainly Lord Dawlish would have been more prudent not to have  parted with even eleven shillings, for he was not a rich man.  Indeed, with the single exception of the Earl of Wetherby, whose  finances were so irregular that he could not be said to possess an  income at all, he was the poorest man of his rank in the British  Isles.    It was in the days of the Regency that the Dawlish coffers first  began to show signs of cracking under the strain, in the era of  the then celebrated Beau Dawlish. Nor were his successors backward  in the spending art. A breezy disregard for the preservation of  the pence was a family trait. Bill was at Cambridge when his  predecessor in the title, his Uncle Philip, was performing the  concluding exercises of the dissipation of the Dawlish doubloons,  a feat which he achieved so neatly that when he died there was  just enough cash to pay the doctors, and no more. Bill found  himself the possessor of that most ironical thing, a moneyless  title. He was then twenty-three.    Until six months before, when he had become engaged to Claire  Fenwick, he had found nothing to quarrel with in his lot. He was  not the type to waste time in vain regrets. His tastes were  simple. As long as he could afford to belong to one or two golf  clubs and have something over for those small loans which, in  certain of the numerous circles in which he moved, were the  inevitable concomitant of popularity, he was satisfied. And this  modest ambition had been realized for him by a group of what he  was accustomed to refer to as decent old bucks, who had installed  him as secretary of that aristocratic and exclusive club, Brown's  in St James Street, at an annual salary of four hundred pounds.  With that wealth, added to free lodging at one of the best clubs  in London, perfect health,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#1)"],[1,"THE CAVES AND JUNGLES OF HINDOSTAN    By Helena Petrovna Blavatsky    Translated From The Russian          Translator's Preface      \"You must remember,\" said Mme. Blavatsky, \"that I never meant this for a  scientific work. My letters to the Russian Messenger, under the general  title: 'From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan,' were written in  leisure moments, more for amusement than with any serious design.    \"Broadly speaking, the facts and incidents are true; but I have freely  availed myself of an author's privilege to group, colour, and dramatize  them, whenever this seemed necessary to the full artistic effect;  though, as I say, much of the book is exactly true, l would rather claim  kindly judgment for it, as a romance of travel, than incur the critical  risks that haunt an avowedly serious work.\"    To this caution of the author's, the translator must add another; these  letters, as Mme Blavatsky says, were written in leisure moments, during  1879 and 1880, for the pages of the Russki Vyestnik, then edited by M.  Katkoff. Mme. Blavatsky's manuscript was often incorrect; often obscure.  The Russian compositors, though they did their best to render faithfully  the Indian names and places, often produced, through their ignorance of  Oriental tongues, forms which are strange, and sometimes unrecognizable.  The proof-sheets were never corrected by the author, who was then in  India; and, in consequence, it has been impossible to restore all the  local and personal names to their proper form.    A similar difficulty has arisen with reference to quotations and  cited authorities, all of which have gone through a double process of  refraction: first into Russian, then into English. The translator, also  a Russian, and far from perfectly acquainted with English, cannot  claim to possess the erudition necessary to verify and restore the many  quotations to verbal accuracy; all that is hoped is that, by a careful  rendering, the correct sense has been preserved.    The translator begs the indulgence of English readers for all  imperfections of style and language; in the words of the Sanskrit  proverb: \"Who is to be blamed, if success be not reached after due  effort?\"    The translator's best thanks are due to Mr. John C. Staples, for  valuable help in the early chapters.--London, July, 1892          Contents           In Bombay       On the Way to Karli       In the Karli Caves       Vanished Glories       A City of the Dead       Brahmanic Hospitalities       A Witch's Den       God's Warrior       The Banns of Marriage       The Caves of Bagh       An Isle of Mystery       Jubblepore          FROM THE CAVES AND JUNGLES OF HINDOSTAN          In Bombay        Late in the evening of the sixteenth of February, 1879, after a rough  voyage which lasted thirty-two days, joyful exclamations were heard  everywhere on deck. \"Have you seen the lighthouse?\" \"There it is at  last, the Bombay lighthouse.\"    Cards, books, music, everything was forgotten. Everyone rushed on deck.  The moon had not risen as yet, and, in spite of the starry tropical sky,  it was quite dark. The stars were so bright that, at first, it seemed  hardly possible to distinguish, far away amongst them, a small fiery  point lit by earthly hands. The stars winked at us like so many huge  eyes in the black sky, on one side of which shone the Southern Cross.  At last we distinguished the lighthouse on the distant horizon. It was  nothing but a tiny fiery point diving in the phosphorescent waves. The  tired travellers greeted it warmly. The rejoicing was general.    What a glorious daybreak followed this dark night! The sea no longer  tossed our ship. Under the skilled guidance of the pilot, who had just  arrived, and whose bronze form was so sharply defined against the pale  sky, our steamer, breathing heavily with its broken machinery, slipped  over the quiet, transparent waters of the Indian Ocean straight to  the harbour. We were only four miles from Bombay, and, to us, who had  trembled with cold only a few weeks ago in the Bay of Biscay, which has  been so glorified by many poets and so heartily cursed by all sailors,  our surroundings simply seemed a magical dream.    After the tropical nights of the Red Sea and the scorching hot days  that had tortured us since Aden, we, people of the distant North, now  experienced something strange and unwonted, as if the very fresh soft  air had cast its spell over us. There was not a cloud in the sky,  thickly strewn with dying stars. Even the moonlight, which till then had  covered the sky with its silvery garb, was gradually vanishing; and the  brighter grew the rosiness of dawn over the small island that lay before  us in the East, the paler in the West grew the scattered rays of the  moon that sprinkled with bright flakes of light the dark wake our ship  left behind her, as if the glory of the West was bidding good-bye to us,  while the light of the East welcomed the newcomers from far-off lands.  Brighter and bluer grew the sky, swiftly absorbing the remaining pale  stars one after the other, and we felt something touching in the  sweet dignity with which the Queen of Night resigned her rights to the  powerful usurper. At last, descending lower and lower, she disappeared  completely.    And suddenly, almost without interval between darkness and light, the  red-hot globe, emerging on the opposite side from under the cape, leant  his golden chin on the lower rocks of the island and seemed to stop for  a while, as if examining us. Then, with one powerful effort, the torch  of day rose high over the sea and gloriously proceeded on its path,  including in one mighty fiery embrace the blue waters of the bay, the  shore and the islands with their rocks and cocoanut forests. His golden  rays fell upon a crowd of Parsees, his rightful worshippers, who stood  on shore raising their arms towards the mighty \"Eye of Ormuzd.\" The  sight was so impressive that everyone on deck became silent for a  moment, even a red-nosed old sailor, who was busy quite close to us over  the cable, stopped working, and, clearing his throat, nodded at the sun.    Moving slowly and cautiously along the charming but treacherous bay, we  had plenty of time to admire the picture around us. On the right was a  group of islands with Gharipuri or Elephanta, with its ancient temple,  at their head. Gharipuri translated means \"the town of caves\" according  to the Orientalists, and \"the town of purification\" according to the  native Sanskrit scholars. This temple, cut out by an unknown hand in  the very heart of a rock resembling porphyry, is a true apple of  discord amongst the archaeologists, of whom none can as yet fix, even  approximately, its antiquity. Elephanta raises high its rocky brow, all  overgrown with secular cactus, and right under it, at the foot of the  rock, are hollowed out the chief temple and the two lateral ones. Like  the serpent of our Russian fairy tales, it seems to be opening its  fierce black mouth to swallow the daring mortal who comes to take  possession of the secret mystery of Titan. Its two remaining teeth, dark  with time, are formed by two huge pillars t the entrance, sustaining the  palate of the monster.    How many generations of Hindus, how many races, have knelt in the  dust before the Trimurti, your threefold deity, O Elephanta? How many  centuries were spent by weak man in digging out in your stone bosom this  town of temples and carving your gigantic idols? Who can say? Many years  have elapsed since I saw you last, ancient, mysterious temple, and still  the same restless thoughts, the same recurrent questions vex me snow as  they did then, and still remain unanswered. In a few days we shall see  each other again. Once more I shall gaze upon your stern image, upon  your three huge granite faces, and shall feel as hopeless as ever of  piercing the mystery of your being. This secret fell into safe hands  three centuries before ours. It is not in vain that the old Portuguese  historian Don Diego de Cuta boasts that \"the big square stone fastened  over the arch of the pagoda with a distinct inscription, having been  torn out and sent as a present to the King Dom Juan III, disappeared  mysteriously in the course of time....,\" and adds, further, \"Close to  this big pagoda there stood another, and farther on even a third one,  the most wonderful of all in beauty, incredible size, and richness of  material. All those pagodas and caves have been built by the Kings of  Kanada, (?) the most important of whom was Bonazur, and these buildings  of Satan our (Portuguese) soldiers attacked with such vehemence that in  a few years one stone was not left upon another....\" And, worst of  all, they left no inscriptions that might have given a clue to so much.  Thanks to the fanaticism of Portuguese soldiers, the chronology of the  Indian cave temples must remain for ever an enigma to the archaeological  world, beginning with the Brah-mans, who say Elephanta is 374,000 years  old, and ending with Fergusson, who tries to prove that it was carved  only in the twelfth century of our era. Whenever one turns one's eyes to  history, there is nothing to be found but hypotheses and darkness. And  yet Gharipuri is mentioned in the epic Mahabharata, which was written,  according to Colebrooke and Wilson, a good while before the reign of  Cyrus. In another ancient legend it is said that the temple of Trimurti  was built on Elephanta by the sons of Pandu, who took part in the war  between the dynasties of the Sun and the Moon, and, belonging to the  latter, were expelled at the end of the war. The Rajputs, who are the  descendants of the first, still sing of this victory; but even in their  popular songs there is nothing positive. Centuries have passed and will  pass, and the ancient secret will die in the rocky bosom of the cave  still unrecorded.    On the left side of the bay, exactly opposite Elephanta, and as if in"]]]
