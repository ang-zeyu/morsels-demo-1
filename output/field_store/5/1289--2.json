[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#1)"],[1,"by    Gilbert K. Chesterton        \"To My Father\"        Source    Heretics was copyrighted in 1905 by the John Lane Company. This  electronic text is derived from the twelfth (1919) edition published by  the John Lane Company of New York City and printed by the Plimpton  Press of Norwood, Massachusetts.  The text carefully follows that of  the published edition (including British spelling).      The Author    Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in London, England on the 29th of  May, 1874.  Though he considered himself a mere \"rollicking  journalist,\" he was actually a prolific and gifted writer in virtually  every area of literature.  A man of strong opinions and enormously  talented at defending them, his exuberant personality nevertheless  allowed him to maintain warm friendships with people--such as George  Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells--with whom he vehemently disagreed.    Chesterton had no difficulty standing up for what he believed. He was  one of the few journalists to oppose the Boer War. His 1922 \"Eugenics  and Other Evils\" attacked what was at that time the most progressive of  all ideas, the idea that the human race could and should breed a  superior version of itself. In the Nazi experience, history  demonstrated the wisdom of his once \"reactionary\" views.    His poetry runs the gamut from the comic 1908 \"On Running After One's  Hat\" to dark and serious ballads.  During the dark days of 1940, when  Britain stood virtually alone against the armed might of Nazi Germany,  these lines from his 1911 Ballad of the White Horse were often quoted:        I tell you naught for your comfort,      Yea, naught for your desire,      Save that the sky grows darker yet      And the sea rises higher.    Though not written for a scholarly audience, his biographies of authors  and historical figures like Charles Dickens and St. Francis of Assisi  often contain brilliant insights into their subjects. His Father Brown  mystery stories, written between 1911 and 1936, are still being read  and adapted for television.    His politics fitted with his deep distrust of concentrated wealth and  power of any sort.  Along with his friend Hilaire Belloc and in books  like the 1910 \"What's Wrong with the World\" he advocated a view called  \"Distributionism\" that was best summed up by his expression that every  man ought to be allowed to own \"three acres and a cow.\" Though not known  as a political thinker, his political influence has circled the world.  Some see in him the father of the \"small is beautiful\" movement and a  newspaper article by him is credited with provoking Gandhi to seek a  \"genuine\" nationalism for India rather than one that imitated the  British.    Heretics belongs to yet another area of literature at which Chesterton  excelled.  A fun-loving and gregarious man, he was nevertheless  troubled in his adolescence by thoughts of suicide.  In Christianity he  found the answers to the dilemmas and paradoxes he saw in life. Other  books in that same series include his 1908 Orthodoxy (written in  response to attacks on this book) and his 1925 The Everlasting Man.  Orthodoxy is also available as electronic text.    Chesterton died on the 14th of June, 1936 in Beaconsfield,  Buckinghamshire, England.  During his life he published 69 books and at  least another ten based on his writings have been published after his  death.  Many of those books are still in print. Ignatius Press is  systematically publishing his collected writings.          Table of Contents       1. Introductory Remarks on the Importance of Othodoxy     2. On the Negative Spirit     3.

Introductory Remarks on the Importance of Orthodoxy    Nothing more strangely indicates an enormous and silent evil of modern  society than the extraordinary use which is made nowadays of the word  \"orthodox.\"  In former days the heretic was proud of not being a  heretic.  It was the kingdoms of the world and the police and the  judges who were heretics. He was orthodox.  He had no pride in having  rebelled against them; they had rebelled against him.  The armies with  their cruel security, the kings with their cold faces, the decorous  processes of State, the reasonable processes of law--all these like  sheep had gone astray. The man was proud of being orthodox, was proud  of being right. If he stood alone in a howling wilderness he was more  than a man; he was a church.  He was the centre of the universe; it was  round him that the stars swung.  All the tortures torn out of forgotten  hells could not make him admit that he was heretical. But a few modern  phrases have made him boast of it.  He says, with a conscious laugh, \"I  suppose I am very heretical,\" and looks round for applause.  The word  \"heresy\" not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means  being clear-headed and courageous. The word \"orthodoxy\" not only no  longer means being right; it practically means being wrong.  All this  can mean one thing, and one thing only.  It means that people care less  for whether they are philosophically right.  For obviously a man ought  to confess himself crazy before he confesses himself heretical. The  Bohemian, with a red tie, ought to pique himself on his orthodoxy. The  dynamiter, laying a bomb, ought to feel that, whatever else he is, at  least he is orthodox.    It is foolish, generally speaking, for a philosopher to set fire to  another philosopher in Smithfield Market because they do not agree in  their theory of the universe.  That was done very frequently in the  last decadence of the Middle Ages, and it failed altogether in its  object.  But there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and  unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of  saying that his philosophy does not matter, and this is done  universally in the twentieth century, in the decadence of the great  revolutionary period. General theories are everywhere contemned; the  doctrine of the Rights of Man is dismissed with the doctrine of the  Fall of Man. Atheism itself is too theological for us to-day.  Revolution itself is too much of a system; liberty itself is too much  of a restraint. We will have no generalizations.  Mr. Bernard Shaw has  put the view in a perfect epigram:  \"The golden rule is that there is  no golden rule.\" We are more and more to discuss details in art,  politics, literature. A man's opinion on tramcars matters; his opinion  on Botticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter.  He  may turn over and explore a million objects, but he must not find that  strange object, the universe; for if he does he will have a religion,  and be lost. Everything matters--except everything.    Examples are scarcely needed of this total levity on the subject of  cosmic philosophy.  Examples are scarcely needed to show that, whatever  else we think of as affecting practical affairs, we do not think it  matters whether a man is a pessimist or an optimist, a Cartesian or a  Hegelian, a materialist or a spiritualist. Let me, however, take a  random instance.  At any innocent tea-table we may easily hear a man  say, \"Life is not worth living.\" We regard it as we regard the  statement that it is a fine day; nobody thinks that it can possibly  have any serious effect on the man or on the world.  And yet if that  utterance were really believed, the world would stand on its head.  Murderers would be given medals for saving men from life; firemen would  be denounced for keeping men from death; poisons would be used as  medicines; doctors would be called in when people were well; the Royal  Humane Society would be rooted out like a horde of assassins. Yet we  never speculate as to whether the conversational pessimist will  strengthen or disorganize society; for we are convinced that theories  do not matter.    This was certainly not the idea of those who introduced our freedom.  When the old Liberals removed the gags from all the heresies, their  idea was that religious and philosophical discoveries might thus be  made. Their view was that cosmic truth was so important that every one  ought to bear independent testimony.  The modern idea is that cosmic  truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one says. The  former freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound; the latter frees  inquiry as men fling back into the sea a fish unfit for eating. Never  has there been so little discussion about the nature of men as now,  when, for the first time, any one can discuss it.  The old restriction  meant that only the orthodox were allowed to discuss religion. Modern  liberty means that nobody is allowed to discuss it. Good taste, the  last and vilest of human superstitions, has succeeded in silencing us  where all the rest have failed. Sixty years ago it was bad taste to be  an avowed atheist. Then came the Bradlaughites, the last religious men,  the last men who cared about God; but they could not alter it.  It is  still bad taste to be an avowed atheist.  But their agony has achieved  just this--that now it is equally bad taste to be an avowed Christian.  Emancipation has only locked the saint in the same tower of silence as  the heresiarch.  Then we talk about Lord Anglesey and the weather, and  call it the complete liberty of all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F.

Smith was so long in the public service of the  Church that his published sermons and writings would fill many  volumes. The difficult problem of the compilers of this volume has  been to make a collection of extracts that would do full justice to  the man and that, at the same time, could be contained in a volume of  moderate size. Every reader who knows Church literature will note the  shortcomings of the work; and none more than the compilers. However,  incomplete as it may be, this collection is well worth while, for it  contains a wealth of gospel wisdom, to instruct, comfort, and inspire  the Saints.    The literature of the Church has been carefully and systematically  searched to discover all of President Smith's public writings and  sermons. Those of a historical nature have not been used in this  collection, as they may well be made into another volume.    The compilers give their thanks to the many who, with hearts full of  love for President Smith, have helped in the work.    The work has reaffirmed to us that prophets, speaking for God, are with  us.    The Compilers.        INTRODUCTION    President Joseph F. Smith incidentally stated on one occasion that when  he should pass away, unlike many of his brethren, he would leave no  written work, by which he might be remembered. It was his modest way  of viewing his own ministry and literary labors, for President Smith  would live in the hearts of the people even if he had said nothing for  the printed page; but on the contrary, it was discovered that there are  volumes in print, though at that time it had not been gathered and was  therefore not so well known.    One of the compilers of this volume, Dr. John A. Widtsoe, listening to  his remark, thought to himself, \"certainly it cannot be true that he  has left no written work.\" He then decided to look into his published  writings and sermons, conceived the idea of making extracts from them  and arranging these extracts by subjects and in chapters, in the form  of a book. The result is this splendid volume now presented to the  public under the title GOSPEL DOCTRINE.    Doctor John A. Widtsoe interested his brother, Prof. Osborne J. P.  Widtsoe, also Albert E. Bowen, Doctor F. S. Harris, and Joseph Quinney,  in the work of compiling and classifying from the voluminous writings  and sermons of President Smith, such extracts as would bear upon the  subjects chosen for consideration--subjects covering a wide range in  gospel doctrine and philosophy, as taught by the Latter-day Saints.  Lorenzo N. Stohl generously paid the expenses of the work.    Without price, and as a matter of love for the work in hand, these  brethren proceeded with the compilation, had four typewritten copies  prepared, nicely bound and titled, and were privileged, sometime before  the death of the President, to offer him the first typewritten copy of  the work, with their love and gratitude for his life, his example, and  his inspired teachings, as well as for his gentle kindness and constant  helpfulness to each of them.    Needless to say, the presentation and the work were gladly accepted and  gave President Smith great delight.    The Committee on Study for the Priesthood Quorums, being apprised by  the compilers of the work, conceived the idea, under the initiative of  Elder David O. McKay, of the Council of the Twelve, of making it a text  book for the Priesthood. The volume is now presented to the Melchizedek  Priesthood Quorums of the Church for their study and consideration. To  accompany it is \"A Guide\" for the direction of teachers and students,  and adopted for convenience in reference and study.    The sermons and writings of President Joseph F. Smith teach, in wisdom  and moderation, practically every essential doctrine of the Latter-day  Saints concerning the present life and the life hereafter. Not only  that, but they abound in helpful counsel and advice on everyday  practices in right living, stated in simple and persuasive language.  President Smith's sermons and writings breathe the true spirit of the  Gospel, are sound as gold in tenet and precept, and express the will of  the Master in every word. Gathered, classified, arranged, and printed  as in this volume, they constitute a compendium of the doctrine and  teachings of the Church that we believe will stand as a safe guide for  its members for generations to come.    In presenting this compilation to the public, we are confident that  every reader will be fully repaid in its perusal, containing, as it  does, rich and vital selections from the sayings, teachings and sermons  of one of the foremost prophets of the Lord in the Dispensation of the  Fulness of Times.
