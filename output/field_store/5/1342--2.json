The Opening of the Blue Chest          THE STORY GIRL        CHAPTER I. THE HOME OF OUR FATHERS    \"I do like a road, because you can be always wondering what is at the  end of it.\"    The Story Girl said that once upon a time. Felix and I, on the May  morning when we left Toronto for Prince Edward Island, had not then  heard her say it, and, indeed, were but barely aware of the existence of  such a person as the Story Girl. We did not know her at all under that  name. We knew only that a cousin, Sara Stanley, whose mother, our Aunt  Felicity, was dead, was living down on the Island with Uncle Roger  and Aunt Olivia King, on a farm adjoining the old King homestead in  Carlisle. We supposed we should get acquainted with her when we reached  there, and we had an idea, from Aunt Olivia's letters to father, that  she would be quite a jolly creature. Further than that we did not think  about her. We were more interested in Felicity and Cecily and Dan,  who lived on the homestead and would therefore be our roofmates for a  season.    But the spirit of the Story Girl's yet unuttered remark was thrilling  in our hearts that morning, as the train pulled out of Toronto. We were  faring forth on a long road; and, though we had some idea what would be  at the end of it, there was enough glamour of the unknown about it to  lend a wonderful charm to our speculations concerning it.    We were delighted at the thought of seeing father's old home, and living  among the haunts of his boyhood. He had talked so much to us about it,  and described its scenes so often and so minutely, that he had inspired  us with some of his own deep-seated affection for it--an affection that  had never waned in all his years of exile. We had a vague feeling that  we, somehow, belonged there, in that cradle of our family, though we had  never seen it. We had always looked forward eagerly to the promised day  when father would take us \"down home,\" to the old house with the spruces  behind it and the famous \"King orchard\" before it--when we might ramble  in \"Uncle Stephen's Walk,\" drink from the deep well with the Chinese  roof over it, stand on \"the Pulpit Stone,\" and eat apples from our  \"birthday trees.\"    The time had come sooner than we had dared to hope; but father could  not take us after all. His firm asked him to go to Rio de Janeiro that  spring to take charge of their new branch there. It was too good a  chance to lose, for father was a poor man and it meant promotion and  increase of salary; but it also meant the temporary breaking up of our  home. Our mother had died before either of us was old enough to remember  her; father could not take us to Rio de Janeiro. In the end he decided  to send us to Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet down on the homestead; and our  housekeeper, who belonged to the Island and was now returning to it,  took charge of us on the journey. I fear she had an anxious trip of it,  poor woman! She was constantly in a quite justifiable terror lest we  should be lost or killed; she must have felt great relief when she  reached Charlottetown and handed us over to the keeping of Uncle Alec.  Indeed, she said as much.    \"The fat one isn't so bad. He isn't so quick to move and get out of your  sight while you're winking as the thin one. But the only safe way to  travel with those young ones would be to have 'em both tied to you with  a short rope--a MIGHTY short rope.\"    \"The fat one\" was Felix, who was very sensitive about his plumpness.  He was always taking exercises to make him thin, with the dismal result  that he became fatter all the time. He vowed that he didn't care; but he  DID care terribly, and he glowered at Mrs. MacLaren in a most undutiful  fashion. He had never liked her since the day she had told him he would  soon be as broad as he was long.    For my own part, I was rather sorry to see her going; and she cried over  us and wished us well; but we had forgotten all about her by the time  we reached the open country, driving along, one on either side of Uncle  Alec, whom we loved from the moment we saw him. He was a small man, with  thin, delicate features, close-clipped gray beard, and large, tired,  blue eyes--father's eyes over again. We knew that Uncle Alec was fond  of children and was heart-glad to welcome \"Alan's boys.\" We felt at home  with him, and were not afraid to ask him questions on any subject that  came uppermost in our minds. We became very good friends with him on  that twenty-four mile drive.    Much to our disappointment it was dark when we reached Carlisle--too  dark to see anything very distinctly, as we drove up the lane of the  old King homestead on the hill. Behind us a young moon was hanging over  southwestern meadows of spring-time peace, but all about us were the  soft, moist shadows of a May night. We peered eagerly through the gloom.    \"There's the big willow, Bev,\" whispered Felix excitedly, as we turned  in at the gate.    There it was, in truth--the tree Grandfather King had planted when he  returned one evening from ploughing in the brook field and stuck the  willow switch he had used all day in the soft soil by the gate.    It had taken root and grown; our father and our uncles and aunts had  played in its shadow; and now it was a massive thing, with a huge girth  of trunk and great spreading boughs, each of them as large as a tree in  itself.    \"I'm going to climb it to-morrow,\" I said joyfully.    Off to the right was a dim, branching place which we knew was the  orchard; and on our left, among sibilant spruces and firs, was the old,  whitewashed house--from which presently a light gleamed through an open  door, and Aunt Janet, a big, bustling, sonsy woman, with full-blown  peony cheeks, came to welcome us.    Soon after we were at supper in the kitchen, with its low, dark,  raftered ceiling from which substantial hams and flitches of bacon were  hanging. Everything was just as father had described it. We felt that we  had come home, leaving exile behind us.    Felicity, Cecily, and Dan were sitting opposite us, staring at us when  they thought we would be too busy eating to see them. We tried to stare  at them when THEY were eating; and as a result we were always catching  each other at it and feeling cheap and embarrassed.    Dan was the oldest; he was my age--thirteen. He was a lean, freckled  fellow with rather long, lank, brown hair and the shapely King nose. We  recognized it at once. His mouth was his own, however, for it was like  to no mouth on either the King or the Ward side; and nobody would have  been anxious to claim it, for it was an undeniably ugly one--long and  narrow and twisted. But it could grin in friendly fashion, and both  Felix and I felt that we were going to like Dan.    Felicity was twelve. She had been called after Aunt Felicity, who was  the twin sister of Uncle Felix. Aunt Felicity and Uncle Felix, as father  had often told us, had died on the same day, far apart, and were buried  side by side in the old Carlisle graveyard.    We had known from Aunt Olivia's letters, that Felicity was the beauty of  the connection, and we had been curious to see her on that account. She  fully justified our expectations. She was plump and dimpled, with big,  dark-blue, heavy-lidded eyes, soft, feathery, golden curls, and a pink  and white skin--\"the King complexion.\" The Kings were noted for their  noses and complexion. Felicity had also delightful hands and wrists. At  every turn of them a dimple showed itself. It was a pleasure to wonder  what her elbows must be like.    She was very nicely dressed in a pink print and a frilled muslin apron;  and we understood, from something Dan said, that she had \"dressed up\"  in honour of our coming. This made us feel quite important. So far as we  knew, no feminine creatures had ever gone to the pains of dressing up on  our account before.    Cecily, who was eleven, was pretty also--or would have been had Felicity  not been there. Felicity rather took the colour from other girls. Cecily  looked pale and thin beside her; but she had dainty little features,  smooth brown hair of satin sheen, and mild"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#1)"],[1,"LUTHER                                CARL E.

God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful  law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest  lurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.    Into such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by  superstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben,  Germany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm,  convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a  Christian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth  was lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the  impact of his life.    The Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning  after his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His  parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They  had moved recently from the farming community of Möhra, home of the  Luther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the  copper mines.    When Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by  Mansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty  that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time  Martin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a  school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was  the custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door  with one of the school choirs.    He stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish  school of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by  singing and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a  woman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar  into her home.    Hans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was  seventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of  Erfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had  passed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.                                 Into the Cloister    Obedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began  his post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field  of law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the  whole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian  monastery.    Hans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were  astounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but  in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in  the words \"religious experience.\"    His parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early  influence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and  the last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle  ages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was  tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He  attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school.  His introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and  shortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness  and heaven.    Several grim incidents increased his anxiety. While on a holiday from  the university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his  student sword. He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the  Virgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague  moved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to  Mansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning  struck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he  invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed \"Help me, and I will become a monk.\"  Fifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of  the \"Black Cloister,\" monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in  Erfurt.    That this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and  that his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of  a monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university,  later proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.                                  Monk and Priest    Luther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain  for several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being  examined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was  shaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl,  and formally received as a novice.    He scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various  ascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended  Luther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was  received into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and  scholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for  the priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.    The petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's  energy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic  theology available at that time. However, long hours with books did  little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought  within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own  efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that  his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to  compensate for his sins.    Although his heart was not at rest, Luther continued to perform his  priestly duties and undertake any new tasks assigned to him. In the fall  of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been  entrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established  University of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic  and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a  bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of  the Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called  back to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for  about a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another  monk on a mission to Rome.    In the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible.  His high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of  its reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church  remained unshaken.        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]          THE PROFESSOR                                     Dr. Luther    Luther returned to Erfurt from Rome, and in the summer of 1511 was sent  as one of three new professors to Wittenberg. Here he came under the  influence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who  showed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.    As yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy,  and forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but  he never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried  the path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than  could be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.    Luther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined  stages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series  of crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave  periods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved  and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through  his own works.    Staupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's  weakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was  no striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual "]]]
