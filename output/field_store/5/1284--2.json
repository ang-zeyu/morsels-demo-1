THE PRECURSORS OF THE GERMAN MYSTICS            TO most English readers the \"Imitation of Christ\" is the  representative of mediaeval German mysticism. In reality, however,  this beautiful little treatise belongs to a period when that  movement had nearly spent itself. Thomas a Kempis, as Dr. Bigg has  said,[1] was only a semi-mystic. He tones down the most  characteristic doctrines of Eckhart, who is the great original  thinker of the German mystical school, and seems in some ways to  revert to an earlier type of devotional literature. The \"Imitation\"  may perhaps be described as an idealised picture of monastic piety,  drawn at a time when the life of the cloister no longer filled a  place of unchallenged usefulness in the social order of Europe. To  find German mysticism at its strongest we must go back a full  hundred years, and to understand its growth we must retrace our  steps as far as the great awakening of the thirteenth century--the  age of chivalry in religion--the age of St. Louis, of Francis and  Dominic, of Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas. It was a vast revival,  bearing fruit in a new ardour of pity and charity, as well as in a  healthy freedom of thought. The Church, in recognising the new  charitable orders of Francis and Dominic, and the Christianised  Aristotelianism of the schoolmen, retained the loyalty and profited  by the zeal of the more sober reformers, but was unable to prevent  the diffusion of an independent critical spirit, in part provoked  and justified by real abuses. Discontent was aroused, not only by  the worldiness of the hierarchy, whose greed and luxurious living  were felt to be scandalous, but by the widespread economic distress  which prevailed over Western Europe at this period. The crusades  periodically swept off a large proportion of the able-bodied men, of  whom the majority never returned to their homes, and this helped to  swell the number of indigent women, who, having no male protectors,  were obliged to beg their bread. The better class of these female  mendicants soon formed themselves into uncloistered charitable  Orders, who were not forbidden to marry, and who devoted themselves  chiefly to the care of the sick. These Beguines and the  corresponding male associations of Beghards became very numerous in  Germany. Their religious views were of a definite type. Theirs was  an intensely inward religion, based on the longing of the soul for  immediate access to God. The more educated among them tended to  embrace a vague idealistic Pantheism. Mechthild of Magdeburg  (1212-1277), prophetess, poetess, Church reformer, quietist, was the  ablest of the Beguines. Her writings prove to us that the technical  terminology of German mysticism was in use before Eckhart,[2] and  also that the followers of what the \"Theologia Germanica\" calls the  False Light, who aspired to absorption in the Godhead, and despised  the imitation of the incarnate Christ, were already throwing  discredit on the movement. Mechthild's independence, and her  unsparing denunciations of corruption in high places, brought her  into conflict with the secular clergy. They tried to burn her  books--those religious love songs which had already endeared her to  German popular sentiment. It was then that she seemed to hear a  voice saying to her:    Lieb' meine, betrÂŸbe dich nicht zu sehr,    Die Wahrheit mag niemand verbrennen!    The rulers of the Church, unhappily, were not content with burning  books. Their hostility towards the unrecognised Orders became more  and more pronounced: the Beghards and Beguines were harried and  persecuted till most of them were driven to join the Franciscans or  Dominicans, carrying with them into those Orders the ferment of  their speculative mysticism. The more stubborn \"Brethren and Sisters  of the Free Spirit\" were burned in batches at Cologne and elsewhere.  Their fate in those times did not excite much pity, for many of the  victims were idle vagabonds of dissolute character, and the general  public probably thought that the licensed begging friars were enough  of a nuisance without the addition of these free lances.    The heretical mystical sects of the thirteenth century are very  interesting as illustrating the chief dangers of mysticism. Some of  these sectaries were Socialists or Communists of an extreme kind;  others were Rationalists, who taught that Jesus Christ was the son  of Joseph and a sinner like other men; others were Puritans, who  said that Church music was \"nothing but a hellish noise\" (nihil nisi  clamor inferni), and that the Pope was the magna meretrix of the  Apocalypse. The majority were Anti-Sacramentalists and Determinists;  and some were openly Antinomian, teaching that those who are led by  the Spirit can do no wrong. The followers of Amalric of Bena[3]  believed that the Holy Ghost had chosen their sect in which to  become incarnate; His presence among them was a continual guarantee  of sanctity and happiness. The \"spiritual Franciscans\" had dreams of  a more apocalyptic kind. They adopted the idea of an \"eternal  Gospel,\" as expounded by Joachim of Floris, and believed that the  \"third kingdom,\" that of the Spirit, was about to begin among  themselves. It was to abolish the secular Church and to inaugurate  the reign of true Christianity--i.e. \"poverty\" and asceticism.    Such are some of the results of what our eighteenth-century  ancestors knew and dreaded as \"Enthusiasm\"--that ferment of the  spirit which in certain epochs spreads from soul to soul like an  epidemic, breaking all the fetters of authority, despising tradition  and rejecting discipline in its eagerness to get rid of formalism  and unreality; a lawless, turbulent, unmanageable spirit, in which,  notwithstanding, is a potentiality for good far higher than any to  which the lukewarm \"religion of all sensible men\" can ever attain.  For mysticism is the raw material of all religion; and it is easier  to discipline the enthusiast than to breathe enthusiasm into the  disciplinarian.    Meanwhile, the Church looked with favour upon the orthodox mystical  school, of which Richard and Hugo of St. Victor, Bonaventura, and  Albertus Magnus were among the greatest names. These men were  working out in their own fashion the psychology of the contemplative  life, showing how we may ascend through \"cogitation, meditation, and  speculation\" to \"contemplation,\" and how we may pass successively  through jubilus, ebrietas spiritus, spiritualis jucunditas, and  liquefactio, till we attain raptus or ecstasy. The writings of the  scholastic mystics are so overweighted with this pseudo-science,  with its wire-drawn distinctions and meaningless classifications,  that very few readers have now the patience to dig out their  numerous beauties. They are, however, still the classics of mystical  theology in the Roman Church, so far as that science has not  degenerated into mere miracle-mongering.    Sect. 2. MEISTER ECKHART    It was in 1260, when Mechthild of Magdeburg was at the height of her  activity, that Meister Eckhart, next to Plotinus the greatest  philosopher-mystic, was born at Hocheim in Thuringia. It seems that  his family was in a good position, but nothing is known of his early  years. He entered the Dominican Order as a youth, perhaps at  sixteen, the earliest age at which novices were admitted into that  Order. The course of instruction among the Dominicans was as  follows:--After two years, during which the novice laid the  foundations of a good general education, he devoted the next two  years to grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic, and then the same amount  of time to what was called the Quadrivium, which consisted of  \"arithmetic, mathematics, astronomy, and music.\" Theology, the queen  of the sciences, occupied three years; and at the end of the course,  at the age of twenty-five, the brothers were ordained priests. We  find Eckhart, towards the end of the century, Prior of Erfurt and  Vicar of Thuringia, then Lector Biblicus at Paris, then Provincial  Prior of Saxony. In 1307 the master of the Order appointed him  Vicar-General for Bohemia, and in 1311 he returned to Paris. We find  him next preaching busily at Strassburg,[4] and after a few more  years, at Cologne, where the persecution of the Brethren of the Free  Spirit was just then at its height. At Strassburg there were no less  than seven convents of Dominican nuns, for since 1267 the Order had  resumed the supervision of female convents, which it had renounced a  short time after its foundation. Many of Eckhart's discourses were  addressed to these congregations of devout women, who indeed were to  a large extent the backbone of the mystical movement, and it is  impossible not to see that the devotional treatises of the school  are strongly coloured by feminine sentiment. A curious poem, written  by a Dominican nun of this period, celebrates the merits of three  preachers, the third of whom is a Master Eckhart, \"who speaks to us  about Nothingness. He who understands him not, in him has never  shone the light divine.\" These nuns seem to have been fed with the  strong meat of Eckhart's mystical philosophy; in the more popular  sermons he tried to be intelligible to all. It was not very long  after he took up his residence at Cologne that he was himself  attacked for heresy. In 1327 he read before his own Order a  retractation of \"any errors which might be found\" (si quid errorum  repertum fuerit) in his writings, but withdrew nothing that he had  actually said, and protested that he believed himself to be  orthodox. He died a few months later, and it was not till 1329 that  a Papal bull was issued,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#1)"],[1,"WIVES AND SEVEN PRISONS    Or Experiences In The Life Of A Matrimonial Maniac.

SOME one has said that if any man would faithfully write his  autobiography, giving truly his own history and experiences, the ills  and joys, the haps and mishaps that had fallen to his lot, he could not  fail to make an interesting story; and Disraeli makes Sidonia say  that there is romance in every life. How much romance, as well as sad  reality, there is in the life of a man who, among other experiences,  has married seven wives, and has been seven times in prison--solely on  account of the seven wives, may be learned from the pages that follow.    I was born in the town of Chatham, Columbia County, New York, in  September, 1813. My father was a New Englander, who married three times,  and I was the eldest son of his third wife, a woman of Dutch descent,  or, as she would have boosted if she had been rich, one of the  old Knickerbockers of New York. My parents were simply honest,  hard--working, worthy people, who earned a good livelihood, brought up  their children to work, behaved themselves, and were respected by their  neighbors. They had a homestead and a small farm of thirty acres, and on  the place was a blacksmith shop in which my father worked daily, shoeing  horses and cattle for farmers and others who came to the shop from miles  around.    There were three young boys of us at home, and we had a chance to go to  school in the winter, while during the summer we worked on the little  farm and did the \"chores\" about the house and barn. But by the time I  was twelve years old I began to blow and strike in the blacksmith  shop, and when I was sixteen years old I could shoe horses well, and  considered myself master of the trade. At the age of eighteen, I went  into business with my father, and as I was now entitled to a share  of the profits, I married the daughter of a well-to-do neighboring  farmer, and we began our new life in part of my father's house, setting  up for ourselves, and doing our own house-keeping.    I ought to have known then that marrying thus early in life, and  especially marrying the woman I did, was about the most foolish thing  I could do. I found it out afterwards, and was frequently and painfully  reminded of it through many long years. But all seemed bright enough  at the start. My wife was a good-looking woman of just my own age; her  family was most respectable; two of her brothers subsequently became  ministers of the gospel; and all the children had been carefully brought  up. I was thought to have made a good match; but a few years developed  that had wedded a most unworthy woman.    Seventeen months after our marriage, our oldest child, Henry, was born.  Meanwhile we had gone to Sidney, Delaware County, where my father opened  a shop. I still continued in business with him, and during our stay at  Sidney, my daughter, Elizabeth, was born. From Sidney, my father wanted  to go to Bainbridge, Chenango, County, N.Y., and I went with him,  leaving my wife and the children at Sidney, while we prospected. As  usual my father started a blacksmith-shop; but I bought a hundred acres  of timber land, went to lumbering, and made money. We had a house about  four miles from the"]]]
