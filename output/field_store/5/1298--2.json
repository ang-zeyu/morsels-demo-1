We hope to interest and inform you. We believe the rubber industry  will be better off if the future citizens of our country know more  about it.          CHAPTER 1    THE DISCOVERY      If you were asked, \"What did Columbus discover in 1492?\" you would  have but one answer. But what he discovered on his second voyage  is not quite so easy to say. He was looking for gold when he  landed on the island of Hayti on that second trip. So his eyes  were blind to the importance of a simple game which he saw being  played with a ball that bounced by some half-naked Indian boys on  the sand between the palm trees and the sea. Instead of the  coveted gold, he took back to Europe, just as curiosities, some of  the strange black balls given him by these Indian boys. He learned  that the balls were made from the hardened juice of a tree.    The little boys and girls of Spain were used to playing with balls  made of rags or wool, so you may imagine how these bouncing balls  of the Indians must have pleased them. But the men who sent out  this second expedition gave the balls little thought and certainly  no value. Since Columbus brought back no gold, he was thrown into  prison for debt, and he never imagined that, four hundred years  later, men would turn that strange, gummy tree juice into more  gold than King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and all the princes of  Europe ever dreamed of.    In the next century after Columbus's travels the Portuguese  founded the colony of Brazil on the continent of South America.  Their settlements were near the coast and they did not begin to  explore the great Amazon region for a hundred years or so. The  journey down this great river--which Theodore Roosevelt took so  many years later--was first made by a Portuguese missionary, who  found the same kind of gummy tree juice as that of the West  Indies. But the natives along the Amazon had discovered that  besides being elastic it was waterproof, and they were making  shoes that would keep out water. You can picture a native boy  spilling some of this liquid on his foot, then covering it, as he  might with a mud pie, and when it dried wiggling his toes to find  that, he had the first and perhaps the best fitting gum shoe that  ever was made.    Little by little samples of this new substance found their way to  Europe. It was another hundred years before thoughtful men  believed it worth while to investigate this gum. In 1731 the Paris  Academy of Science sent some explorers to learn about it. One of  these Frenchmen, La Condamine, wrote of a tree called \"Hevea\"[1]  \"There flows from this tree a liquor which hardens gradually and  blackens in the air.\" He found the people of Quito waterproofing  cloth with it, and the Amazon Indians were making boots which, when  blackened in smoke, looked like leather. Most interesting of all,  they coated bottle-shaped moulds, and when the gum had hardened they  would break the mould, shaking the pieces out of the neck, leaving  an unbreakable bottle that would hold liquids.      [1] Hevea is pronounced Hee'-vee-uh. Caoutchouc is  pronounced koo'-chook.      It was not long afterwards that Lisbon began to import some of  these crudely fashioned articles, and it is said that in 1755 the  King of Portugal sent to Brazil several pairs of his boots to be  waterproofed. A few years later the Government of Para, Brazil,  sent him a full suit of rubber clothes. For all that, this elastic  gum was for the most part only a curiosity, and few people knew  there was such a thing.    About the year 1770, a black, bouncing ball of caoutchouc, as the  Indians called the gum, after many travels found its way to  England, and Priestley, the man who gave us oxygen, learned that  it would rub out pencil marks. Then and there he named it what you  have probably guessed long before this: \"rub-ber.\" Nearly every  language except English uses in place of the word rubber some form  of the native Word \"caoutchouc,\" which means \"weeping tree.\" After  Priestley's discovery, a one-inch \"rubber\" sold for three  shillings, or about seventy-five cents, but artists were glad to  pay even that price, because their work was made so much easier.          CHAPTER 2    CHARLES GOODYEAR      In 1800 Brazil was the only country manufacturing rubber articles,  and her best market soon proved to be North America. Probably the  first rubber this country saw was brought to New England in  clipper ships as ballast in the form of crude lumps and balls.  Rubber shoes, water-bottles, powder-flasks, and tobacco-pouches  found buyers in the American ports, but rubber shoes were most in  demand.    Soon some Americans began to import raw rubber and to manufacture  rubber goods of their own, and in the old world a Scotchman named  Macintosh found a way of waterproofing cloth by spreading on it a  thin coating of rubber dissolved in coal naphtha. Many people  still refer to raincoats as mackintoshes. Rubber clothing shared  favor with rubber shoes, but its popularity was short-lived for it  did not wear well and was almost as sensitive to temperature as  molasses and butter. The rubber shoes and coats get hard and stiff  in winter and soft and sticky in summer. A man wearing a pair of  rubber overalls who sat down too near a warm stove soon found that  his overalls, his chair and himself were stuck fast together. The  first rubber coats became so stiff in cold weather that when you  took one off you could stand it up in the middle of the floor and  leave it, for it would stand like a tent until the rubber thawed  out, and when thawed it was almost as uncomfortable as is fly-paper  to the fly.    One day Charles Goodyear, a Connecticut hardware merchant of an  inventive turn of mind, went to a store to buy a life preserver.  He could find only imperfect ones, but they drew his attention to  the study of rubber, and presently he was thinking of it by day  and dreaming of it by night. Rubber became a passion with him. He  felt sure some way could be found to make it firm yet flexible  regardless of temperature, and for ten years he experimented with  different mixtures and processes, hoping to find the right one. So  intent was he on his search that he found time for nothing else.  Due to neglect his business went to pieces and he became very  poor.    Finally, in 1839, when he was on the point of giving up in  despair, he accidentally came upon the solution. He was  experimenting in his kitchen, a place which, through lack of  funds, he was often forced to use as a laboratory. Part of a  mixture of rubber, sulphur and other chemicals, with which he was  working, happened to drop on the top of the stove. It lay there  sizzling and charring until the odor of the burning rubber called  his attention to it. As he stooped to scrape it off the stove he  gave a start of wonder as he noted that a change had come over the  rubber during its brief contact with the stove.    To his surprise the mixture had not melted, but had flattened out  in the shape of a silver dollar. When it had cooled enough to be  handled, he found that it bent and stretched easily, without  cracking or breaking, and that it always snapped back to its  original shape. Strangest of all, it was no longer sticky.  Apparently half the problem was solved. Whether his new mixture  would stand the cold he had yet to find out, so he nailed it on  the outside of the door and went to bed. Probably he slept but  little and was up early. At any rate he found the rubber  unaffected by the cold.    Then he knew that he had made a real discovery and he named the  process \"vulcanizing\" after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.  \"Vulcanizing\" means mixing pure rubber with certain chemicals and  then applying heat. On this process, which is by no means simple,  the great rubber business of the world has been established.  Practically everything made of rubber, or of which rubber is a  part, has to go through the vulcanizing process, whether it is a  pair of Keds, a tire, a fruit jar ring, or a doormat.    So many people had been deceived by previous rubber ventures that  Goodyear had great trouble in finding anyone with enough faith to  invest money in his discovery. It was some time before he was able  to take out the first of the more than sixty patents which he was  granted during his lifetime for applying his process to various  uses. Under these patents he licensed several factories to use the  process in the manufacture of rubber goods, but required them to  stamp all goods with the words \"Goodyear patent.\" Scores of  companies have since used the name Goodyear, but the only  factories that he licensed which are now in existence are parts of  the United States Rubber Company.    Goodyear often had to defend his patents in court. In the most  famous of these suits, he was defended by Daniel Webster and  opposed by Rufus Choate, so that we see interwoven in the story of  rubber the names of two of the greatest statesmen this country has  produced.          CHAPTER 3    THE HEVEA TREE      For the very first of the rubber story we may thank a little  wood-boring beetle, and the way nature has of helping her children to  protect themselves.

I charm in vain; for never again,    All keenly as my glance I bend,      Will Memory, goddess coy,      Embody for my joy    Departed days, nor let me gaze      On thee, my fairy friend!      Yet could thy face, in mystic grace,    A moment smile on me, 'twould send      Far-darting rays of light      From Heaven athwart the night,    By which to read in very deed      Thy spirit, sweetest friend!      So may the stream of Life's long dream    Flow gently onward to its end,      With many a floweret gay,      Adown its willowy way:    May no sigh vex, no care perplex,      My loving little friend!        NOTA BENE.    With each copy of this Book is given an Envelope, containing a  Diagram (similar to the frontispiece) on card, and nine Counters,  four red and five grey.    The Envelope, &c. can be had separately, at 3d. each.    The Author will be very grateful for suggestions, especially from  beginners in Logic, of any alterations, or further explanations,  that may seem desirable.  Letters should be addressed to him at  \"29, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London.\"        PREFACE        \"There foam'd rebellious Logic, gagg'd and bound.\"      This Game requires nine Counters--four of one colour and five of  another:  say four red and five grey.    Besides the nine Counters, it also requires one Player, AT LEAST.  I am not aware of any Game that can be played with LESS than this  number:  while there are several that require MORE:  take Cricket,  for instance, which requires twenty-two.  How much easier it is,  when you want to play a Game, to find ONE Player than twenty-two.  At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more  amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting  each other's mistakes.    A second advantage, possessed by this Game, is that, besides being  an endless source of amusement (the number of arguments, that may  be worked by it, being infinite), it will give the Players a little  instruction as well.  But is there any great harm in THAT, so long  as you get plenty of amusement?        CONTENTS.      CHAPTER                                PAGE       I.  NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.           1.

Propositions.                \"Some new Cakes are nice.\"              \"No new Cakes are nice.\"              \"All new cakes are nice.\"    There are three 'PROPOSITIONS' for you--the only three kinds we  are going to use in this Game:  and the first thing to be done is  to learn how to express them on the Board.    Let us begin with    \"Some new Cakes are nice.\"    But before doing so, a remark has to be made--one that is rather  important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment:  so  please to read this VERY carefully.    The world contains many THINGS (such as \"Buns\", \"Babies\", \"Beetles\".  \"Battledores\". &c.);  and these Things possess many ATTRIBUTES  (such as \"baked\", \"beautiful\", \"black\", \"broken\", &c.:  in fact,  whatever can be \"attributed to\", that is \"said to belong to\", any  Thing, is an Attribute).  Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we  use a SUBSTANTIVE:  when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use  an ADJECTIVE.  People have asked the question \"Can a Thing exist  without any Attributes belonging to it?\"  It is a very puzzling  question, and I'm not going to try to answer it:  let us turn up  our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really  wasn't worth noticing.  But, if they put it the other way, and ask  \"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to?\", we  may say at once \"No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey  with no one to take care of it!\"  You never saw \"beautiful\" floating  about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing  to BE beautiful, now did you?    And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole?  It is  this.  You may put \"is\" or \"are\" between names of two THINGS (for  example, \"some Pigs are fat Animals\"), or between the names of two  ATTRIBUTES (for example, \"pink is light-red\"), and in each case it  will make good sense.  But, if you put \"is\" or \"are\" between the  name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, \"some  Pigs are pink\"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing  BE an Attribute?) unless you have an understanding with the person  to whom you are speaking.  And the simplest understanding would, I  think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated  at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out  in full, would be \"some Pigs are pink (Pigs)\".  And now the word  \"are\" makes quite good sense.    Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition \"some new Cakes  are nice\", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the  form \"some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)\".  Now this contains two  'TERMS'--\"new Cakes\" being one of them, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the  other.  \"New Cakes,\" being the one we are talking about, is called  the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the 'PREDICATE'.  Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it  does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of  it.  The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they  speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and  the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of \"new Cakes\".  Lastly,  if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION'  itself, you may take this:--\"a sentence stating that some, or  none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called  its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class,  called its 'Predicate'\".    You will find these seven words--PROPOSITION, ATTRIBUTE, TERM,  SUBJECT, PREDICATE, PARTICULAR, UNIVERSAL--charmingly useful, if  any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied Logic.  Mind you bring all seven words into your answer, and you friend  will go away deeply impressed--'a sadder and a wiser man'.    Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose  it to be a cupboard, intended for all the Cakes in the world (it  would have to be a good large one, of course).  And let us suppose  all the new ones to be put into the upper half (marked 'x'), and all  the rest (that is, the NOT-new ones) into the lower half (marked  'x'').  Thus the lower half would contain ELDERLY Cakes, AGED  Cakes, ANTE-DILUVIAN Cakes--if there are any:  I haven't seen many,  myself--and so on.  Let us also suppose all the nice Cakes to be  put into the left-hand half (marked 'y'), and all the rest (that  is, the not-nice ones) into the right-hand half (marked 'y'').  At  present, then, we must understand x to mean \"new\", x' \"not-new\",  y \"nice\", and y' \"not-nice.\"    And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment  No. 5?    It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Cakes  in it, they must be NEW: and it is part of the left-hand half;  so that they must be NICE.  Hence if there are any Cakes in this  compartment, they must have the double 'ATTRIBUTE' \"new and nice\":  or, if we use letters, the must be \"x y.\"    Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of  this compartment.  This you will find a very convenient rule for  knowing what Attributes belong to the Things in any compartment.  Take No. 7, for instance.  If there are any Cakes there, they must  be \"x' y\", that is, they must be \"not-new and nice.\"    Now let us make another agreement--that a red counter in a  compartment shall mean that it is 'OCCUPIED', that is, that there  are SOME Cakes in it.  (The word 'some,' in Logic, means 'one or  more' so that a single Cake in a compartment would be quite enough"]]]
