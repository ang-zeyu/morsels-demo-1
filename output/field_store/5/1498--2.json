In an article, entitled \"Then and Now,\" published in the December  number, 1890, of \"The Arena,\" its author, a distinguished Unitarian  D.D. of Boston, Mass., says. \"Astronomy has shattered the fallacies of  Astrology; and people have found out that the stars are minding their  own business instead of meddling with theirs.\" Now, while it is true  that modern Astronomy has superseded the ancient system, and people  have ceased to believe that the stars are intervening in mundane  affairs, nothing could be further from the truth than the assertion  that \"Astronomy has shattered the fallacies of Astrology;\" and those of  our readers who will accord to this work an unprejudiced perusal can  hardly fail to be convinced that a large majority of the people of  Christendom are dominated as much by these fallacies as were our Pagan  ancestry--the only difference being a change of name. The dogmatic  element of religion, which was anciently designated as Astrology, is  now known as Theology.    All the evidences bearing upon the subject indicate that the founders  of the primary form of religion were a sect of philosophers, known as  Magi, or wise men, of the Aryan race of Central Asia, who, having lived  ages before any conceptions of the supernatural had obtained in the  world, and speculating relative to the \"beginnings of things,\" were  necessarily confined to the contemplation and study of nature, the  elements of which they believed to be self-existent and endless in  duration; but, being wholly without knowledge of her inherent forces,  they explained her manifold processes by conceiving the idea that she  was animated by a great and inherent soul or spirit, emanations from  which impressed all her parts with life and motion. Thus, endowing man,  and other animals, with souls emanating alike from the imaginary great  soul of nature, they believed, and taught, that immediately after death  all souls were absorbed into their source, where, as \"the dewdrop slips  into the shining sea,\" all personal identity was forever lost. Hence we  see that although recognizing the soul as immortal, considering it, not  as an entity existing independent of matter, but as the spirit of  matter itself, the primary religion was the exponent of the purest form  of Materialism.    Being the Astronomers of their day, and mistaking the apparent for the  real, the ancient Magi constructed that erroneous system of nature  known as the Geocentric, and, in conformity thereto, composed a  collection of Astronomical Allegories, in which the emanations from the  imaginary great soul of nature, by which they believed all  materialities we're impressed with life and motion, were personified  and made to play their respective parts. Basing the religion they  instituted upon their system of Allegorical Astronomy, and making its  personifications the objects of worship, they thus originated the  anthropomorphic or man-like Gods, and, claiming to have composed them  under the inspiration of these self same divinities, they designated  them as sacred records, or Scriptures, and taught the ignorant masses  that they were literal histories, and their personifications real  personages, who, having once lived upon earth, and; for the good of  mankind, performed the wondrous works imputed to them, were then in  heaven whence they came.    Thus we see that the primary religion, which is popularly known as  Paganism, was founded in the worship of personified nature; that,  according special homage to the imaginary genii of the stars, and  inculcating supreme adoration to the divinity supposed to reside in the  sun, it was anciently known by the general name of Astrolatry, and by  the more specific one of solar worship; and that its founders,  arrogating to themselves the title of Astrologers, gave to its dogmatic  element the name of Astrology.    In studying the primitive forms of religion it will be found that none  of them taught anything relative to a future life, for the simple  reason that their founders had no conceptions of such a state. Hence it  follows that the laws they enacted were intended solely for the  regulation of their social relations, and, to secure their observance,  they were embodied into their sacred records and made part of their  religion. One form of that most ancient worship was known as Sabaism,  or Sabism. Another form of the same religion was the Ancient Judaism,  as portrayed in the Old Testament, and more especially in the  Pentateuch, or first five books; in the Decalogue of which the only  promise made for the observance of one of the Commandments is length of  days on earth; and, in a general summing up of the blessings and curses  to be enjoyed or suffered, for the observance or violation of the laws,  as recorded in the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy, it will be seen they  are all of a temporal character only. At the beginning of the Christian  era there were still in existence a sect of Jews known as Sadducees,  who were strict adherents to the primitive form of worship, and their  belief relative to the state of the dead we find recorded in  Ecclesiastes xii., 7, which reads: \"Then shall the dust return to earth  as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.\"    For ages the doctrine of soul absorption, immediately after death,  constituted the belief of mankind; but ultimately recognizing the fact  that the temporal punishments of the existing laws were wholly  inadequate to the prevention of crime, and conceiving the idea that the  ignorant and vicious masses could be governed with a surer hand by  appealing to the sentiments of hope and fear in relation to the rewards  and punishments of an imaginary future life, the ancient Astrologers  resolved to remodel the dogmatic elements of religion so as to include  that doctrine. But realizing the necessity, of suppressing the belief  in the absorption of all souls, immediately after death, they ceased to  teach it, and ultimately it was embodied in that secret and unwritten  system known as the Esoteric philosophy, in which the Astrologers  formulated their own private belief, and which for many centuries was  kept from the knowledge of the uninitiated by their successors in the  priestly office. As they were the sole custodians of the Scriptures,  they made do change in their verbiage, but, adding the doctrine of  future rewards and punishments to that written and openly taught system  of faith known as the Exoteric creed, they made it the more impressive  by instituting a system of imposing rites and ceremonies, which they  designated as Mysteries, into which they initiated the neophytes, and  in which were portrayed, in the most vivid manner, the rewards and  punishments of the imaginary future life, which they taught were the  awards of the Gods for the observance or violation of the laws. These  teachings were inculcated in the lesser degrees only, but those who  were found worthy of so great a distinction were also inducted into the  higher"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#1)"],[1,"FLOWERS WORTH KNOWING    ADAPTED BY    ASA DON DICKINSON    From _Nature's Garden_    BY NELTJE BLANCHAN    _1917_            PREFACE      A still more popular edition of what has proved to the author to be a  surprisingly popular book, has been prepared by the able hand of Mr. Asa  Don Dickinson, and is now offered in the hope that many more people will  find the wild flowers in Nature's garden all about us well worth  knowing. For flowers have distinct objects in life and are everything  they are for the most justifiable of reasons, _i.e._, the perpetuation  and the improvement of their species. The means they employ to  accomplish these ends are so various and so consummately clever that, in  learning to understand them, we are brought to realize how similar they  are to the fundamental aims of even the human race. Indeed there are few  life principles that plants have not worked out satisfactorily. The  problems of adapting oneself to one's environment, of insuring healthy  families, of starting one's children well in life, of founding new  colonies in distant lands, of the cooperative method of conducting  business as opposed to the individualistic, of laying up treasure in the  bank for future use, of punishing vice and rewarding virtue--these and  many other problems of mankind the flowers have worked out with the help  of insects, through the ages. To really understand what the wild flowers  are doing, what the scheme of each one is, besides looking beautiful, is  to give one a broader sympathy with both man and Nature and to add a  real interest and joy to life which cannot be too widely shared.
