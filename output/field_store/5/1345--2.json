UNABRIDGED FROM THE ORIGINAL 1811 EDITION WITH A FOREWORD BY  ROBERT CROMIE    COMPILED ORIGINALLY BY CAPTAIN GROSE.    AND NOW CONSIDERABLY ALTERED AND ENLARGED, WITH THE MODERN  CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS, BY A MEMBER OF THE WHIP CLUB.    ASSISTED BY HELL-FIRE DICK, AND JAMES GORDON,  ESQRS. OF CAMBRIDGE; AND WILLIAM SOAMES, ESQ. OF  THE HON. SOCIETY OF NEWMAN'S HOTEL.            PREFACE.    The merit of Captain Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue has  been long and universally acknowledged. But its circulation was  confined almost exclusively to the lower orders of society: he  was not aware, at the time of its compilation, that our young men  of fashion would at no very distant period be as distinguished  for the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate;  and he therefore conceived it superfluous to incorporate with his  work the few examples of fashionable slang that might occur to  his observation.    But our Jehus of rank have a phraseology not less peculiar to  themselves, than the disciples of Barrington: for the uninitiated  to understand their modes of expression, is as impossible as for  a Buxton to construe the Greek Testament. To sport an Upper  Benjamin, and to swear with a good grace, are qualifications  easily attainable by their cockney imitators; but without the aid  of our additional definitions, neither the cits of Fish-street,  nor the boors of Brentford would be able to attain the language  of whippism. We trust, therefore, that the whole tribe of  second-rate Bang Ups, will feel grateful for our endeavour to render  this part of the work as complete as possible. By an occasional  reference to our pages, they may be initiated into all the  peculiarities of language by which the man of spirit is  distinguished from the man of worth. They may now talk bawdy  before their papas, without the fear of detection, and abuse  their less spirited companions, who prefer a good dinner at home  to a glorious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazard of a  cudgelling.    But we claim not merely the praise of gratifying curiosity, or  affording assistance to the ambitious; we are very sure that the  moral influence of the Lexicon Balatronicum will be more certain  and extensive than that of any methodist sermon that has ever  been delivered within the bills of mortality. We need not descant  on the dangerous impressions that are made on the female mind, by  the remarks that fall incidentally from the lips of the brothers  or servants of a family; and we have before observed, that  improper topics can with our assistance be discussed, even before  the ladies, without raising a blush on the cheek of modesty. It  is impossible that a female should understand the meaning of  TWIDDLE DIDDLES, or rise from table at the mention of BUCKINGER'S  BOOT. Besides, Pope assures us, that \"VICE TO BE HATED NEEDS BUT  TO BE SEEN;\" in this volume it cannot be denied, that she is seen  very plainly; and a love of virtue is, therefore, the necessary  result of perusing it.    The propriety of introducing the UNIVERSITY SLANG will be readily  admitted; it is not less curious than that of the College in the  Old  Bailey, and is less generally understood. When the number and  accuracy of our additions are compared with the price of the  volume, we have no doubt that its editors will meet with the  encouragement that is due to learning, modesty, and virtue.

The original writings were in the form of letters written to  Anita during the last few years.  When my sons, Dennis and Larry,  learned of the letters, they also asked for copies.    As I began writing, I soon realized that I knew very little about  the details of the lives of my parents and grandparents.    So I set out to tell my children a few things about myself and to  leave unmentioned some things which I do not want them to know  about me.  I also included some things about a few kinfolks and  neighbors who had a part in molding the character whom my  children now refer to as \"Dad.\"    It was hoped that the letters would aid in their better  understanding of how certain teachings and ideals had been handed  down through generations, and that they might better understand  why they grew up under those rules and customs.    Others also may be interested in the way one family lived in the  Southwest around the turn of the century and later.

Mama, William Robert, Ollie  Mae, Clarence, Albert, Joel, Earl          CHAPTER 1    PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, OUR FIRST FARM    My Johnson grandparents reared nine children.  Andrew was the  oldest and was a half brother to the other eight.  Joe was  Grandma's first born, second was my father, William Franklin.  All but one of them lived and thrived and raised children.  That's why I have dozens of cousins.    When my father was born, the family lived in Bosque County,  Texas, somewhere about Meridian.  They were ranchers and owned a  bunch of cattle.  Some 20 years later we find the family in  Concho County somewhere near Paint Rock or in between Paint Rock  and where the little town of Melvin now stands.    At least two of the boys, Joe and Will, worked for the Melvin  brothers on their ranch.  I have heard Papa tell of breaking  saddle horses for the brothers as well as trail driving near San  Angelo.    In the meantime the weather turned dry, grass became scarce, and  the Johnsons drove their cattle to Indian Territory, (Oklahoma)  looking for grass in about the year of 1894--that is, all but  Joe.  He stayed with his job in Texas.    About a year after the family moved to Oklahoma, Will Johnson got  a neighbor boy to go with him back to their place in Texas to  bring another wagon load of household goods.  They were gone  about two weeks.    While the family was in Oklahoma, Will--who was about 20--taught  school two terms at Nubbin Ridge, somewhere near Duncan.  Simpson, being about 17 at the time, was not about to go to  school to a teacher who was his older brother, so he saddled his  horse and slipped away back to Melvin's ranch, to be with his  brother Joe.  He said he got tired of riding but not nearly as  tired as his horse.  The journey was about 300 miles.  He was on  the trail three days and nights and had to stop at times to let  his horse rest.  When he got to the ranch, Joe wrote to the  family saying that Simpson was with him and for them not to  worry.  They had suspected where he had gone but were not sure.    My Gaddie grandparents reared five children, three boys and two  girls.  Emma, my mother, was next to the youngest.  Hugh was her  younger brother.  When my mother was born the family lived in  Larue County, Kentucky, near Hodgensville.  Their farm joined the  Lincoln farm.  She and Abraham Lincoln drew water from the same  well but not at the same time.  The Lincoln family had moved away  some years before the Gaddies moved there.  The well was on the  fence row between the two farms.    When Emma was four years old her family moved to Dallas County,  Texas.  Then they moved to Grayson County, where Emma started to  school at age seven.  When she was nine they moved back to their  old home place in Kentucky.  Again, when she was 13, they moved  to Dallas County, and at age 16 the family moved to a farm some  eight miles southeast of Duncan, Oklahoma.    About the same time the Gaddie family moved to their farm near  Duncan, we find the Johnson family leaving Texas where the  weather turned dry and the grass became scarce and the Johnsons  drove their cattle to Indian Territory looking for grass, and  they found that grass near Duncan, Oklahoma.    They stayed in Oklahoma about four years and during that time at  least two of the boys were busy at things other than sitting  around watching cattle grow.  Andrew had married a girl named  Mary, and Will had met this pretty little freckle faced girl from  Kentucky.    So then, as you can see, here in farming and cattle country near  Duncan is where the Johnsons met up with the Gaddies.  This is  where a schoolteaching cowboy named Will met a country farmer's  daughter named Emma Lee.  This is where the falling in love took  place.  And this is where Will married Emma in the fall of 1896.  She was 18, he was 22.  They were my parents.    After living in Oklahoma that four years, Grandpa Johnson went  back to Texas looking for land to buy.  He found what he wanted  and bought 1,000 acres of unimproved land in Jones County about  three miles southeast of Hamlin.  Then he went back to Oklahoma  to get the family.    So by the time Grandpa Johnson was ready to start his journey  back to Texas with his family, the family had increased by two  daughters-in-law and two grandchildren.  Will and Emma had a son,  Frank, six weeks old.  Andrew and Mary had a daughter, Ruth, only  three weeks old.  Some thought that Ruth was too young to make  the trip in the cold of winter.  But they all came through in  wagons and drove their cattle.  That was in January of 1898.    In later years Mama told me that she thought she would have  frozen to death if it had not been for Frank in her lap to help  keep her warm.  The trip took two weeks in the dead of winter and  it rained every day of the trip.    Since there were no improvements on the Johnson land, they all  rented other farms for a year or two while they made  improvements.  Papa and Mama rented and farmed one year in Fisher  County.  Much of the well water in that county tastes so strongly  of gypsum that people have to haul their drinking water from the  better wells.  So, the story is told that when they were driving  their covered wagon to Fisher County, they stopped and asked a  man, \"How far is it to Fisher County?\"    The man said, \"You are still about ten miles away.\"    \"How can we tell when we get there?\"    \"You will see farmers hauling water in barrels in wagons.\"    \"Have they always had to haul water in Fisher County?\"    \"Yes, but during the World Flood they didn't have to haul it so  far.  The flood water came within a half-mile of Roby.\"    I guess Grandpa farmed at least one year in Fisher County.  They  tell me that Ed, one of the younger boys, went to school in that  county at White Pond one year.    Grandpa had bought the l,000 acres for all the family.  Andrew  and Will were the first ones to buy their portions of 100 acres  each.  The raw land had cost $3 an acre.  Papa's farm cost him  $300.    Papa was fast becoming a good carpenter and he did his part in  helping build a two-story house on Grandpa's portion of the land.  The house is still in good shape and has a family living in it 77  years later.    Andrew first lived in a dugout on his 100 acres.  They used the  dugout for a kitchen and storm cellar many years after they built  a house beside it.    Papa's land was in the southeast corner of the 1,000 acre tract.  He built his house about a quarter-mile south of Grandpa's house.  It is still standing also.  Since that time some of the Johnson  boys and girls have bought and sold and swapped portions of the  land.  But most of it is still in the hands of the Johnson boys  and girls or their sons and daughters.    After farming in Fisher County in the year of 1898, Papa moved to  a farm in Jones County, a mile northeast of Neinda, and farmed  there in 1899.  And there, in a half-dugout, my sister, Susie,  was born.    Many years later as we would drive by the farm in our hack, on  our way to church at Neinda, our parents would point out the old  dugout and explain, \"There is where we used to "]]]
