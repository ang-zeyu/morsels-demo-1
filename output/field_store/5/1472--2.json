[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8142"],[0,"The Riot Act (#1)"],[1,"text of the Riot Act (c. 1714-1715)      Typed in this February 8, 2002 by Jonathan Walther. The source was cap  V, volume XIII, pages 142-146 of the \"Statutes At Large\" series,  printed in the year 1764. Also indexed as \"Anno primo GEORGEII I. Stat.  2. C. 5.\" Many sources on the Internet claim the Riot Act was passed in  1715; according to Statutes At Large it was passed in 1714. The  confusion may be caused by the fact that the Act took _effect_ in  August of 1715. This is, of course, the famous Riot Act that gave rise  to the expression _\"Read them the Riot Act!_\".        CAP. V.    An act for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies, and for the more  speedy and effectual punishing the rioters.      I.    Whereas of late many rebellious riots and tumults have been in divers  parts of this kingdom, to the disturbance of the publick peace, and the  endangering of his Majesty's person and government, and the same are  yet continued and fomented by persons disaffected to his Majesty,  presuming so to do, for that the punishments provided by the laws now  in being are not adequate to such heinous offences; and by such rioters  his Majesty and his administration have been most maliciously and  falsly traduced, with an intent to raise divisions, and to alienate the  affections of the people from his Majesty therefore for the preventing  and suppressing of such riots and tumults, and for the more speedy and  effectual punishing the offenders therein; be it enacted by the King's  most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords  spiritual and temporal and of the commons, in this present parliament  assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any persons to the  number of twelve or more, being unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously  assembled together, to the disturbance of the publick peace, at any  time after the last day of _July_ in the year of our Lord one thousand  seven hundred and fifteen, and being required or commanded by any one  or more justice or justices of the peace, or by the sheriff of the  county, or his under-sheriff, or by the mayor, bailiff or bailiffs, or  other head-officer, or justice of the peace of any city or town  corporate, where such assembly shall be, by proclamation to be made in  the King's name, in the form herin after directed, to disperse  themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their  lawful business, shall, to the number of twelve or more  (notwithstanding such proclamation made) unlawfully, riotously, and  tumultuously remain or continue together by the space of one hour after  such command or request made by proclamation, that then such continuing  together to the number of twelve or more, after such command or request  made by proclamation, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of  clergy, and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons, and shall  suffer death as in a case of felony without benefit of clergy.        II.    And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the order  and form of the proclamation that shall be made by the authority of  this act, shall be as hereafter followeth (that is to say) the justice  of the peace, or other person authorized by this act to make the said  proclamation shall, among the said rioters, or as near to them as he  can safely come, with a loud voice command, or cause to be commanded  silence to be, while proclamation is making, and after that, shall  openly and with loud voice make or cause to be made proclamation in  these words, or like in effect:        Our sovereign Lord the King chargeth and commandeth all    persons, being assembled, immediately to disperse themselves,    and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their    lawful business, upon the pains contained in the act made    in the first year of King George, for preventing tumults    and riotous assemblies. God save the King.      And every such justice and justices of the peace, sheriff,  under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, and other head-officer aforesaid, within  the limits of their respective jurisdictions, are hereby authorized,  impowered and required, on notice or knowledge of any such unlawful,  riotous and tumultuous assembly, to resort to the place where such  unlawful, riotous, and tumultuous assemblies shall be, of persons to  the number of twelve or more, and there to make or cause to be made  proclamation in manner aforesaid.        III.    And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if such  persons so unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled, or twelve  or more of them, after proclamation made in manner aforesaid, shall  continue together and not disperse themselves within one hour, That  then it shall and may be lawful to and for every justice of the peace,  sheriff, or under-sheriff of the county where such assembly shall be,  and also to and for every high or petty constable, and other  peace-officer within such county, and also to and for every mayor,  justice of the peace, sheriff, bailiff, and other head-officer, high or  petty constable, and other peace-officer of any city or town corporate  where such assembly shall be, and to and for such other person and  persons as shall be commanded to be assisting unto any such justice of  the peace, sheriff or under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, or other  head-officer aforesaid (who are hereby authorized and impowered to  command all his Majesty's subjects of age and ability to be assisting  to them therein) to seize and apprehend, and they are hereby required  to seize and apprehend such persons so unlawfully, riotously and  tumultuously continuing together after proclamation made, as aforesaid,  and forthwith to carry the persons so apprehended before one or more of  his Majesty's justices of the peace of the county or place where such  persons shall be so apprehended, in order to their being proceeded  against for such their offences according to law; and that if the  persons so unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled, or any of  them, shall happen to be killed, maimed or hurt, in the dispersing,  seizing or apprehending, or endeavouring to disperse, seize or  apprehend them, that then every such justice of the peace, sheriff,  under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, head-officer, high or petty constable,  or other peace-officer, and all and singular persons, being aiding and  assisting to them, or any of them, shall be free, discharged and  indemnified, as well against the King's Majesty, his heirs and  successors, as against all and every other person and persons, of, for,  or concerning the killing, maiming, or hurting of any such person or  persons so unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled, that shall  happen to be so killed, maimed or hurt, as aforesaid.        IV.    And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any  persons unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled together, to  the disturbance of the publick peace, shall unlawfully, and with force  demolish or pull down, or begin to demolish or pull down any church or  chapel, or any building for religious worship certified and registred  according to the statute made in the first year of the reign of the  late King _William_ and Queen _Mary_, intituled, _An act for exempting  their Majesty's protestant subjects dissenting from the church of_  England _from the penalties of certain laws_, or any dwelling-house,  barn, stable, or other out-house, that then every such demolishing, or  pulling down, or beginning to demolish, or pull down, shall be adjudged  felony without benefit of clergy, and the offenders therein shall be  adjudged felons, and shall suffer death as in case of felony, without  benefit of clergy.        V.    Provided always, and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,  That if any person or persons do, or shall, with force and arms,  wilfully and knowingly oppose, obstruct, or in any manner wilfully and  knowingly lett, hinder, or hurt any person or persons that shall begin  to proclaim, or go to proclaim according to the proclamation hereby  directed to be made, whereby such proclamation shall not be made, that  then every such apposing, obstructing, letting, hindering or hurting  such person or persons, so beginning or going to make such  proclamation, as aforesaid, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of  clergy, and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons, and shall  suffer death as in case of felony, without benefit of clergy; and that  also every such person or persons so being unlawfully, riotously and  tumultuously assembled, to the number of twelve, as aforesaid, or more,  to whom proclamation should or ought to have been made if the same had  not been hindred, as aforesaid, shall likewise, in case they or any of  them, to the number of twelve or more, shall continue together, and not  disperse themselves within one hour after such lett or hindrance so  made, having knowledge of such lett or hindrance so made, shall be  adjudged felons, and shall suffer death as in case of felony, without  benefit of clergy.

It has little  merit, and must make its way through the world as well as it can. It  will receive many a jostle as it goes along, and perhaps is destined to  add one more to the number of slain in the field of modern criticism.  But if it fall, it may still, in death, be useful to me; for should  some accidental rover take it up and, in turning over its pages, imbibe  the idea of going out to explore Guiana in order to give the world an  enlarged description of that noble country, I shall say, \"fortem ad  fortia misi,\" and demand the armour; that is, I shall lay claim to a  certain portion of the honours he will receive, upon the plea that I  was the first mover of his discoveries; for, as Ulysses sent Achilles  to Troy, so I sent him to Guiana. I intended to have written much more  at length; but days and months and years have passed away, and nothing  has been done. Thinking it very probable that I shall never have  patience enough to sit down and write a full account of all I saw and  examined in those remote wilds, I give up the intention of doing so,  and send forth this account of my \"Wanderings\" just as it was written  at the time.    If critics are displeased with it in its present form, I beg to observe  that it is not totally devoid of interest, and that it contains  something useful. Several of the unfortunate gentlemen who went out to  explore the Congo were thankful for the instructions they found in it;  and Sir Joseph Banks, on sending back the journal, said in his letter:  \"I return your journal with abundant thanks for the very instructive  lesson you have favoured us with this morning, which far excelled, in  real utility, everything I have hitherto seen.\" And in another letter  he says: \"I hear with particular pleasure your intention of resuming  your interesting travels, to which natural history has already been so  much indebted.\" And again: \"I am sorry you did not deposit some part of  your last harvest of birds in the British Museum, that your name might  become familiar to naturalists and your unrivalled skill in preserving  birds be made known to the public.\" And again: \"You certainly have  talents to set forth a book which will improve and extend materially  the bounds of natural science.\"    Sir Joseph never read the third adventure. Whilst I was engaged in it,  death robbed England of one of her most valuable subjects and deprived  the Royal Society of its brightest ornament.

In the month of April 1812 I left the town of Stabroek to travel  through the wilds of Demerara and Essequibo, a part of _ci-devant_  Dutch Guiana, in South America.    The chief objects in view were to collect a quantity of the strongest  wourali poison and to reach the inland frontier-fort of Portuguese  Guiana.    It would be a tedious journey for him who wishes to travel through  these wilds to set out from Stabroek on foot. The sun would exhaust him  in his attempts to wade through the swamps, and the mosquitos at night  would deprive him of every hour of sleep.    The road for horses runs parallel to the river, but it extends a very  little way, and even ends before the cultivation of the plantations  ceases.    The only mode then that remains is to proceed by water; and when you  come to the high-lands, you may make your way through the forest on  foot or continue your route on the river.    After passing the third island in the River Demerara there are few  plantations to be seen, and those not joining on to one another, but  separated by large tracts of wood.    The Loo is the last where the sugar-cane is growing. The greater part  of its negroes have just been ordered to another estate, and ere a few  months shall have elapsed all signs of cultivation will be lost in  underwood.    Higher up stand the sugar-works of Amelia's Waard, solitary and  abandoned; and after passing these there is not a ruin to inform the  traveller that either coffee or sugar have ever been cultivated.    From Amelia's Waard an unbroken range of forest covers each bank of the  river, saving here and there where a hut discovers itself, inhabited by  free people of colour, with a rood or two of bared ground about it; or  where the wood-cutter has erected himself a dwelling and cleared a few  acres for pasturage. Sometimes you see level ground on each side of you  for two or three hours at a stretch; at other times a gently sloping  hill presents itself; and often, on turning a point, the eye is pleased  with the contrast of an almost perpendicular height jutting into the  water. The trees put you in mind of an eternal spring, with summer and  autumn kindly blended into it.    Here you may see a sloping extent of noble trees whose foliage displays  a charming variety of every shade, from the lightest to the darkest  green and purple. The tops of some are crowned with bloom of the  loveliest hue, while the boughs of others bend with a profusion of  seeds and fruits.    Those whose heads have been bared by time or blasted by the  thunderstorm strike the eye, as a mournful sound does the ear in music,  and seem to beckon to the sentimental traveller to stop a moment or two  and see that the forests which surround him, like men and kingdoms,  have their periods of misfortune and decay.    The first rocks of any considerable size that are observed on the side  of the river are at a place called Saba, from the Indian word which  means a stone. They appear sloping down to the water's edge, not  shelvy, but smooth, and their exuberances rounded off and, in some  places, deeply furrowed, as though they had been worn with continual  floods of water.    There are patches of soil up and down, and the huge stones amongst them  produce a pleasing and novel effect. You see a few coffee-trees of a  fine luxuriant growth, and nearly on the top of Saba stands the house  of the post-holder.    He is appointed by Government to give in his report to the protector of  the Indians of what is going on amongst them and to prevent suspicious  people from passing up the river.    When the Indians assemble here, the stranger may have an opportunity of  seeing the aborigines dancing to the sound of their country music and  painted in their native style. They will shoot their arrows for him  with an unerring aim and send the poisoned dart, from the blow-pipe,  true to its destination: and here he may often view all the different  shades, from the red savage to the white man; and from the white man to  the sootiest son of Africa.    Beyond this post there are no more habitations of white men or free  people of colour.    In a country so extensively covered with wood as this is, having every  advantage that a tropical sun and the richest mould, in many places,  can give to vegetation, it is natural to look for trees of very large  dimensions. But it is rare to meet with them above six yards in  circumference. If larger have ever existed they have fallen a sacrifice  either to the axe or to fire.    If, however, they disappoint you in size, they make ample amends in  height. Heedless, and bankrupt in all curiosity, must he be who can  journey on without stopping to take a view of the towering mora. Its  topmost branch, when naked with age or dried by accident, is the  favourite resort of the toucan. Many a time has this singular bird felt  the shot faintly strike him from the gun of the fowler beneath, and  owed his life to the distance betwixt them.    The trees which form these far-extending wilds are as useful as they  are ornamental. It would take a volume of itself to describe them.    The green-heart, famous for its hardness and durability; the hackea for  its toughness; the ducalabali surpassing mahogany; the ebony and  letter-wood vying with the choicest woods of the old world; the  locust-tree yielding copal; and the hayawa- and olou-trees furnishing a  sweet-smelling resin, are all to be met with in the forest betwixt the  plantations and the rock Saba.    Beyond this rock the country has been little explored, but it is very  probable that these, and a vast collection of other kinds, and possibly  many new species, are scattered up and down, in all directions, through  the swamps and hills and savannas of _ci-devant_ Dutch Guiana.    On viewing the stately trees around him, the naturalist will observe  many of them bearing leaves and blossoms and fruit not their own.    The wild fig-tree, as large as a common English apple-tree, often rears  itself from one of the thick branches at the top of the mora, and when  its fruit is ripe, to it the birds resort for nourishment. It was to an  undigested seed passing through the body of the bird which had perched  on the mora that the fig-tree first owed its elevated station there.  The sap of the mora raised it into full bearing, but now, in its turn,  it is doomed to contribute a portion of its own sap and juices towards  the growth of different species of vines, the seeds of which also the  birds deposited on its branches. These soon vegetate, and bear fruit in  great quantities; so what with their usurpation of the resources of the  fig-tree, and the fig-tree of the mora, the mora, unable to support a  charge which nature never intended it should, languishes and dies under  its burden; and then the fig-tree, and its usurping progeny of vines,  receiving no more succour from their late foster-parent, droop and  perish in their turn.
