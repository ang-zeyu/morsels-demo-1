Mr Bickersdyke Walks behind the Bowler's Arm      Considering what a prominent figure Mr John Bickersdyke was to be in  Mike Jackson's life, it was only appropriate that he should make a  dramatic entry into it. This he did by walking behind the bowler's arm  when Mike had scored ninety-eight, causing him thereby to be clean  bowled by a long-hop.    It was the last day of the Ilsworth cricket week, and the house team  were struggling hard on a damaged wicket. During the first two matches  of the week all had been well. Warm sunshine, true wickets, tea in the  shade of the trees. But on the Thursday night, as the team champed  their dinner contentedly after defeating the Incogniti by two wickets,  a pattering of rain made itself heard upon the windows. By bedtime it  had settled to a steady downpour. On Friday morning, when the team of  the local regiment arrived in their brake, the sun was shining once  more in a watery, melancholy way, but play was not possible before  lunch. After lunch the bowlers were in their element. The regiment,  winning the toss, put together a hundred and thirty, due principally to  a last wicket stand between two enormous corporals, who swiped at  everything and had luck enough for two whole teams. The house team  followed with seventy-eight, of which Psmith, by his usual golf  methods, claimed thirty. Mike, who had gone in first as the star bat of  the side, had been run out with great promptitude off the first ball of  the innings, which his partner had hit in the immediate neighbourhood  of point. At close of play the regiment had made five without loss.  This, on the Saturday morning, helped by another shower of rain which  made the wicket easier for the moment, they had increased to a hundred  and forty-eight, leaving the house just two hundred to make on a pitch  which looked as if it were made of linseed.    It was during this week that Mike had first made the acquaintance of  Psmith's family. Mr Smith had moved from Shropshire, and taken Ilsworth  Hall in a neighbouring county. This he had done, as far as could be  ascertained, simply because he had a poor opinion of Shropshire  cricket. And just at the moment cricket happened to be the pivot of his  life.    'My father,' Psmith had confided to Mike, meeting him at the station in  the family motor on the Monday, 'is a man of vast but volatile brain.  He has not that calm, dispassionate outlook on life which marks your  true philosopher, such as myself. I--'    'I say,' interrupted Mike, eyeing Psmith's movements with apprehension,  'you aren't going to drive, are you?'    'Who else? As I was saying, I am like some contented spectator of a  Pageant. My pater wants to jump in and stage-manage. He is a man of  hobbies. He never has more than one at a time, and he never has that  long. But while he has it, it's all there. When I left the house this  morning he was all for cricket. But by the time we get to the ground he  may have chucked cricket and taken up the Territorial Army. Don't be  surprised if you find the wicket being dug up into trenches, when we  arrive, and the pro. moving in echelon towards the pavilion. No,' he  added, as the car turned into the drive, and they caught a glimpse of  white flannels and blazers in the distance, and heard the sound of bat  meeting ball, 'cricket seems still to be topping the bill. Come along,  and I'll show you your room. It's next to mine, so that, if brooding on  Life in the still hours of the night, I hit on any great truth, I shall  pop in and discuss it with you.'    While Mike was changing, Psmith sat on his bed, and continued to  discourse.    'I suppose you're going to the 'Varsity?' he said.    'Rather,' said Mike, lacing his boots. 'You are, of course? Cambridge,  I hope. I'm going to King's.'    'Between ourselves,' confided Psmith, 'I'm dashed if I know what's  going to happen to me. I am the thingummy of what's-its-name.'    'You look it,' said Mike, brushing his hair.    'Don't stand there cracking the glass,' said Psmith. 'I tell you I am  practically a human three-shies-a-penny ball. My father is poising me  lightly in his hand, preparatory to flinging me at one of the milky  cocos of Life. Which one he'll aim at I don't know. The least thing  fills him with a whirl of new views as to my future. Last week we were  out shooting together, and he said that the life of the gentleman-farmer  was the most manly and independent on earth, and that he had a good  mind to start me on that. I pointed out that lack of early training  had rendered me unable to distinguish between a threshing-machine and  a mangel-wurzel, so he chucked that. He has now worked round to  Commerce. It seems that a blighter of the name of Bickersdyke is  coming here for the week-end next Saturday. As far as I can say  without searching the Newgate Calendar, the man Bickersdyke's career  seems to have been as follows. He was at school with my pater, went  into the City, raked in a certain amount of doubloons--probably  dishonestly--and is now a sort of Captain of Industry, manager of some  bank or other, and about to stand for Parliament. The result of these  excesses is that my pater's imagination has been fired, and at time of  going to press he wants me to imitate Comrade Bickersdyke. However,  there's plenty of time. That's one comfort. He's certain to change his  mind again. Ready? Then suppose we filter forth into the arena?'    Out on the field Mike was introduced to the man of hobbies. Mr Smith,  senior, was a long, earnest-looking man who might have been Psmith in a  grey wig but for his obvious energy. He was as wholly on the move as  Psmith was wholly statuesque. Where Psmith stood like some dignified  piece of sculpture, musing on deep questions with a glassy eye, his  father would be trying to be in four places at once. When Psmith  presented Mike to him, he shook hands warmly with him and started a  sentence, but broke off in the middle of both performances to dash  wildly in the direction of the pavilion in an endeavour to catch an  impossible catch some thirty yards away. The impetus so gained carried  him on towards Bagley, the Ilsworth Hall ground-man, with whom a moment  later he was carrying on an animated discussion as to whether he had or  had not seen a dandelion on the field that morning. Two minutes  afterwards he had skimmed away again. Mike, as he watched him, began to  appreciate Psmith's reasons for feeling some doubt as to what would be  his future walk in life.    At lunch that day Mike sat next to Mr Smith, and improved his  acquaintance with him; and by the end of the week they were on  excellent terms. Psmith's father had Psmith's gift of getting on well  with people.    On this Saturday, as Mike buckled on his pads, Mr Smith bounded up,  full of advice and encouragement.    'My boy,' he said, 'we rely on you. These others'--he indicated with a  disparaging wave of the hand the rest of the team, who were visible  through the window of the changing-room--'are all very well. Decent  club bats. Good for a few on a billiard-table. But you're our hope on a  wicket like this. I have studied cricket all my life'--till that summer  it is improbable that Mr Smith had ever handled a bat--'and I know a  first-class batsman when I see one. I've seen your brothers play. Pooh,  you're better than any of them. That century of yours against the Green  Jackets was a wonderful innings, wonderful. Now look here, my boy. I  want you to be careful. We've a lot of runs to make, so we mustn't take  any risks. Hit plenty of boundaries, of course, but be careful.  Careful. Dash it, there's a youngster trying to climb up the elm. He'll  break his neck. It's young Giles, my keeper's boy. Hi! Hi, there!'    He scudded out to avert the tragedy, leaving Mike to digest his expert  advice on the art of batting on bad wickets.    Possibly it was the excellence of this advice which induced Mike to  play what was, to date, the best innings of his life. There are moments  when the batsman feels an almost super-human fitness. This came to Mike  now. The sun had begun to shine strongly. It made the wicket more  difficult, but it added a cheerful touch to the scene. Mike felt calm  and masterful. The bowling had no terrors for him. He scored nine off  his first over and seven off his second, half-way through which he lost  his partner. He was to undergo a similar bereavement several times that  afternoon, and at frequent intervals. However simple the bowling might  seem to him, it had enough sting in it to worry the rest of the team  considerably. Batsmen came and went at the other end with such rapidity  that it seemed hardly worth while their troubling to come in at all.  Every now and then one would give promise of better things by lifting  the slow bowler into the pavilion or over the boundary, but it always  happened that a similar stroke, a few balls later, ended in an easy  catch.

London & Toronto Published By J M Dent & Sons Ltd. & In New York By E.  P. Dutton &. Co    First Issue Of This Edition 1912 Reprinted 1919, 1923, 1928            INTRODUCTION      The Politics of Aristotle is the second part of a treatise of which  the Ethics is the first part. It looks back to the Ethics as the Ethics  looks forward to the Politics. For Aristotle did not separate, as we are  inclined to do, the spheres of the statesman and the moralist. In the  Ethics he has described the character necessary for the good life, but  that life is for him essentially to be lived in society, and when in the  last chapters of the Ethics he comes to the practical application of his  inquiries, that finds expression not in moral exhortations addressed to  the individual but in a description of the legislative opportunities  of the statesman. It is the legislator's task to frame a society which  shall make the good life possible. Politics for Aristotle is not a  struggle between individuals or classes for power, nor a device for  getting done such elementary tasks as the maintenance of order and  security without too great encroachments on individual liberty. The  state is \"a community of well-being in families and aggregations  of families for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life.\" The  legislator is a craftsman whose material is society and whose aim is the  good life.    In an early dialogue of Plato's, the Protagoras, Socrates asks  Protagoras why it is not as easy to find teachers of virtue as it is to  find teachers of swordsmanship, riding, or any other art. Protagoras'  answer is that there are no special teachers of virtue, because virtue  is taught by the whole community. Plato and Aristotle both accept the  view of moral education implied in this answer. In a passage of the  Republic (492 b) Plato repudiates the notion that the sophists have a  corrupting moral influence upon young men. The public themselves,  he says, are the real sophists and the most complete and thorough  educators. No private education can hold out against the irresistible  force of public opinion and the ordinary moral standards of society.  But that makes it all the more essential that public opinion and  social environment should not be left to grow up at haphazard as they  ordinarily do, but should be made by the wise legislator the expression  of the good and be informed in all their details by his knowledge. The  legislator is the only possible teacher of virtue.    Such a programme for a treatise on government might lead us to expect in  the Politics mainly a description of a Utopia or ideal state which  might inspire poets or philosophers but have little direct effect upon  political institutions. Plato's Republic is obviously impracticable, for  its author had turned away in despair from existing politics. He has no  proposals, in that dialogue at least, for making the best of things as  they are. The first lesson his philosopher has to learn is to turn away  from this world of becoming and decay, and to look upon the unchanging  eternal world of ideas. Thus his ideal city is, as he says, a pattern  laid up in heaven by which the just man may rule his life, a pattern  therefore in the meantime for the individual and not for the statesman.  It is a city, he admits in the Laws, for gods or the children of gods,  not for men as they are.    Aristotle has none of the high enthusiasm or poetic imagination of  Plato. He is even unduly impatient of Plato's idealism, as is shown  by the criticisms in the second book. But he has a power to see the  possibilities of good in things that are imperfect, and the patience of  the true politician who has learned that if he would make men what  they ought to be, he must take them as he finds them. His ideal  is constructed not of pure reason or poetry, but from careful and  sympathetic study of a wide range of facts. His criticism of Plato in  the light of history, in Book II. chap, v., though as a criticism it is  curiously inept, reveals his own attitude admirably: \"Let us remember  that we should not disregard the experience of ages; in the multitude  of years, these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been  unknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes  they are not put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge  which they have.\" Aristotle in his Constitutions had made a study of one  hundred and fifty-eight constitutions of the states of his day, and the  fruits of that study are seen in the continual reference to concrete  political experience, which makes the Politics in some respects a  critical history of the workings of the institutions of the Greek city  state. In Books IV., V., and VI. the ideal state seems far away, and  we find a dispassionate survey of imperfect states, the best ways of  preserving them, and an analysis of the causes of their instability.  It is as though Aristotle were saying: \"I have shown you the proper and  normal type of constitution, but if you will not have it and insist on  living under a perverted form, you may as well know how to make the best  of it.\" In this way the Politics, though it defines the state in the  light of its ideal, discusses states and institutions as they are.  Ostensibly it is merely a continuation of the Ethics, but it comes to  treat political questions from a purely political standpoint.    This combination of idealism and respect for the teachings of experience  constitutes in some ways the strength and value of the Politics, but it  also makes it harder to follow. The large nation states to which we are  accustomed make it difficult for us to think that the state could be  constructed and modelled to express the good life. We can appreciate  Aristotle's critical analysis of constitutions, but find it hard to take  seriously his advice to the legislator. Moreover, the idealism and the  empiricism of the Politics are never really reconciled by Aristotle  himself.    It may help to an understanding of the Politics if something is said on  those two points.    We are accustomed since the growth of the historical method to the  belief that states are \"not made but grow,\" and are apt to be impatient  with the belief which Aristotle and Plato show in the powers of the  lawgiver. But however true the maxim may be of the modern nation state,  it was not true of the much smaller and more self-conscious Greek city.  When Aristotle talks of the legislator, he is not talking in the  air. Students of the Academy had been actually called on to give new  constitutions to Greek states. For the Greeks the constitution was not  merely as it is so often with us, a matter of political machinery. It  was regarded as a way of life. Further, the constitution within the  framework of which the ordinary process of administration and passing  of decrees went on, was always regarded as the work of a special man or  body of men, the lawgivers. If we study Greek history, we find that the  position of the legislator corresponds to that assigned to him by  Plato and Aristotle. All Greek states, except those perversions  which Aristotle criticises as being \"above law,\" worked under rigid  constitutions, and the constitution was only changed when the whole  people gave a commission to a lawgiver to draw up a new one. Such was  the position of the AEsumnetes, whom Aristotle describes in Book III.  chap, xiv., in earlier times, and of the pupils of the Academy in the  fourth century. The lawgiver was not an ordinary politician. He was  a state doctor, called in to prescribe for an ailing constitution. So  Herodotus recounts that when the people of Cyrene asked the oracle of  Delphi to help them in their dissensions, the oracle told them to go to  Mantinea, and the Mantineans lent them Demonax, who acted as a \"setter  straight\" and drew up a new constitution for Cyrene. So again the  Milesians, Herodotus tells us, were long troubled by civil discord, till  they asked help from Paros, and the Parians sent ten commissioners  who gave Miletus a new constitution. So the Athenians, when they were  founding their model new colony at Thurii, employed Hippodamus of  Miletus, whom Aristotle mentions in Book II, as the best expert in  town-planning, to plan the streets of the city, and Protagoras as the  best expert in law-making, to give the city its laws. In the Laws Plato  represents one of the persons of the dialogue as having been asked  by the people of Gortyna to draw up laws for a colony which they were  founding. The situation described must have occurred frequently in  actual life. The Greeks thought administration should be democratic and  law-making the work of experts. We think more naturally of law-making  as the special right of the people and administration as necessarily  confined to experts.    Aristotle's Politics, then, is a handbook for the legislator, the expert  who is to be called in when a state wants help. We have called him a  state doctor. It is one of the most marked characteristics of Greek  political theory that Plato and Aristotle think of the statesman as one  who has knowledge of what ought to be done, and can help those who call  him in to prescribe for them, rather than one who has power to control  the forces of society. The desire of society for the statesman's  advice is taken for granted, Plato in the Republic says that a good  constitution is only possible when the ruler does not want to rule;  where men contend for power, where they have not learnt to distinguish  between the art of getting hold of the helm of state and the art of  steering, which alone is statesmanship, true politics is impossible.    With this position much that Aristotle has to say about government is in  agreement. He assumes the characteristic Platonic view that all men seek  the good, and "]]]
