INTRODUCTION      Paul Henri Thiery, Baron d'Holbach (1723-1789), was the center of the  radical wing of the _philosophes_. He was friend, host, and patron to  a wide circle that included Diderot, D'Alembert, Helvetius, and Hume.  Holbach wrote, translated, edited, and issued a stream of books and  pamphlets, often under other names, that has made him the despair of  bibliographers but has connected his name, by innuendo, gossip, and  association, with most of what was written in defense of atheistic  materialism in late eighteenth-century France.    Holbach is best known for _The System of Nature_ (1770) and deservedly,  since it is a clear and reasonably systematic exposition of his main  ideas. His initial position determines all the rest of his argument.  \"There is not, there can be nothing out of that Nature which includes  all beings.\" Conceiving of nature as strictly limited to matter and  motion, both of which have always existed, he flatly denies that there  is any such thing as spirit or a supernatural. Mythology began, Holbach  claims, when men were still in a state of nature and at the point when  wise, strong, and for the most part benign men were arising as leaders  and lawgivers. These leaders \"formed discourses by which they spoke to  the imaginations of their willing auditors,\" using the medium of poetry,  because it \"seem{ed} best adapted to strike the mind.\" Through poetry,  then, and by means of \"its images, its fictions, its numbers, its rhyme,  its harmony... the entire of nature, as well as all its parts, was  personified, by its beautiful allegories.\" Thus mythology is given  an essentially political origin. These early poets are literally  legislators of mankind. \"The first institutors of nations, and their  immediate successors in authority, only spoke to the people by fables,  allegories, enigmas, of which they reserved to themselves the right  of giving an explanation.\" Holbach is rather condescending about the  process, but since mythology is a representation of nature itself, he  is far more tolerant of mythology than he is of the next step. \"Natural  philosophers and poets were transformed by leisure into metaphysicians  and theologians,\" and at this point a fatal error was introduced: the  theologians made a distinction between the power of nature and nature  itself, separated the two, made the power of nature prior to nature, and  called it God. Thus man was left with an abstract and chimerical being  on one side and a despoiled inert nature, destitute of power, on the  other. In Holbach's critique the point at which theology split off from  mythology marks the moment of nature's alienation from itself and paves  the way for man's alienation from nature.    Holbach is thus significant for Romantic interest in myth in two ways.  First, he provides a clear statement of what can be loosely called the  antimythic position, that rationalist condescension and derogation of  all myth and all religion that was never far from the surface during  the Romantic era. Holbach was and is a reminder that the Romantic  affirmation of myth was never easy, uncritical, or unopposed. Any new  endorsement of myth had to be made in the teeth of Holbach and the other  skeptics. The very vigor of the Holbachian critique of myth impelled the  Romantics to think more deeply and defend more carefully any new claim  for myth. Secondly, although Holbach's argument generally drove against  myth and religion both, he did make an important, indeed a saving  distinction between mythology and theology. Mythology is the more or  less harmless personification of the power in and of nature; theology  concerns itself with what for Holbach was the nonexistent power beyond  or behind nature. By exploiting this distinction it would  become possible for a Shelley, for example, to take a strong  antitheological--even an anti-Christian--position without having to  abandon myth.    Holbach was one of William Godwin's major sources for his ideas about  political justice, and Shelley, who discussed Holbach with Godwin,  quotes extensively from _The System of Nature_ in _Queen Mab_.  Furthermore, Volney's _Ruins_, another important book for Shelley,  is directly descended from _The System of Nature_. On the other side,  Holbach was a standing challenge to such writers as Coleridge and Goethe  and was reprinted and retranslated extensively in America, where his  work was well known to the rationalist circle around Jefferson and  Barlow.    Issued in 1770 as though by Jean Baptiste de Mirabaud (a former  perpetual secretary to the Academie francaise who had died ten years  before), _La Systeme de la nature_ was translated and reprinted  frequently. The Samuel Wilkinson translation we have chosen to reprint  was the most often reprinted or pirated version in English. A useful  starting point for Holbach's work is Jerome Vercruysse, _Bibliographie  descriptive des ecrits du baron d'Holbach_ (Paris, 1971). The difficult  subject of the essentially clandestine evolution of biblical criticism  as an anti-Christian and antimyth critique in the early part of the  eighteenth century, before the well-documented era of the biblical  critic Eichhorn in Germany, is illuminated in Ira Wade, _The Clandestine  Organization and Diffusion of Philosophic Ideas in France from  1700-1750_ (Princeton Univ. Press, 1938).      Robert D. Richardson, Jr.    University of Denver      * * * * *        {Illustration: Parke sculp't M.

PREFACE    _The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The  pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his  infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent  prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders  him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error. He  resembles a child destitute of experience, full of ideal notions: a  dangerous leaven mixes itself with all his knowledge: it is of necessity  obscure, it is vacillating and false:--He takes the tone of his ideas  on the authority of others, who are themselves in error, or else have  an interest in deceiving him. To remove this Cimmerian darkness, these  barriers to the improvement of his condition; to disentangle him from  the clouds of error that envelope him; to guide him out of this Cretan  labyrinth, requires the clue of Ariadne, with all the love she could  bestow on Theseus. It exacts more than common exertion; it needs a most  determined, a most undaunted courage--it is never effected but by a  persevering resolution to act, to think for himself; to examine with  rigour and impartiality the opinions he has adopted. He will find that  the most noxious weeds have sprung up beside beautiful flowers; entwined  themselves around their stems, overshadowed them with an exuberance of  foliage, choaked the ground, enfeebled their growth, diminished their  petals; dimmed the brilliancy of their colours; that deceived by  their apparent freshness of their verdure, by the rapidity of their  exfoliation, he has given them cultivation, watered them, nurtured them,  when he ought to have plucked out their very roots.    Man seeks to range out of his sphere: notwithstanding the reiterated  checks his ambitious folly experiences, he still attempts the  impossible; strives to carry his researches beyond the visible world;  and hunts out misery in imaginary regions. He would be a metaphysician  before he has become a practical philosopher. He quits the contemplation  of realities to meditate on chimeras.

ON THE DIVINITY:--PROOFS OF HIS EXISTENCE:--OF HIS ATTRIBUTES:       OF HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE HAPPINESS OF MAN.        CHAP. I.    _The Origin of Man's Ideas upon the Divinity._      If man possessed the courage, if he had the requisite industry to recur  to the source of those opinions which are most deeply engraven on his  brain; if he rendered to himself a faithful account of the reasons which  make him hold these opinions as sacred; if he coolly examined the basis  of his hopes, the foundation of his fears, he would find that it very  frequently happens, those objects, or those ideas which move him most  powerfully, either have no real existence, or are words devoid of  meaning, which terror has conjured up to explain some sudden disaster;  that they are often phantoms engendered by a disordered imagination,  modified by ignorance; the effect of an ardent mind distracted by  contending passions, which prevent him from either reasoning justly, or  consulting experience in his judgment; that this mind often labours with  a precipitancy that throws his intellectual faculties into confusion;  that bewilders his ideas; that consequently he gives a substance and a  form to chimeras, to airy nothings, which he afterwards idolizes from  sloth, reverences from prejudice.    A sensible being placed in a nature where every part is in motion, has  various feelings, in consequence of either the agreeable or disagreeable  effects which he is obliged to experience from this continued action and  re-action; in consequence he either finds himself happy or miserable;  according to the quality of the sensations excited in him, he will love  or fear, seek after or fly from, the real or supposed causes of such  marked effects operated on his machine. But if he is ignorant of nature,  if he is destitute of experience, he will frequently deceive himself as  to these causes; for want of either capability or inclination to recur  back to them, he will neither have a true knowledge of their energy, nor  a clear idea of their mode of acting: thus until reiterated experience  shall have formed his ideas, until the mirror of truth shall have shewn  him the judgment he ought to make, he will be involved in trouble, a  prey to incertitude, a victim to credulity.    Man is a being who brings with him nothing into the world save an  aptitude to feeling in a manner more or less lively according to his  individual organization: he has no innate knowledge of any of the causes  that act upon him: by degrees his faculty of feeling discovers to him  their various qualities; he learns to judge of them; time familiarizes  him with their properties; he attaches ideas to them, according to  the manner in which they have affected him; these ideas are correct or  otherwise, in a ratio to the soundness of his organic structure:  his judgment is faulty or not, as these organs are either well or  ill-constituted; in proportion as they are competent to afford him sure  and reiterated experience.    The first moments of man are marked by his wants; that is to say, the  first impulse he receives is to conserve his existence; this he would  not be able to maintain without the concurrence of many analogous  causes: these wants in a sensible being, manifest themselves by a  general languor, a sinking, a confusion in his machine, which gives him  the consciousness of a painful sensation: this derangement subsists, is  even augmented, until the cause suitable to remove it re-establishes  the harmony so necessary to the existence of the human frame. Want,  therefore, is the first evil man experiences; nevertheless it is  requisite to the maintenance of his existence. Was it not for this  derangement of his body, which obliges him to furnish its remedy, he  would not be warned of the necessity of preserving the existence he has  received. Without wants man would be an insensible machine, similar to  a vegetable; like that he would be incapable of preserving himself;  he would not be competent to using the means required to conserve his  being. To his wants are to be ascribed his passions; his desires;  the exercise of his corporeal functions; the play of his intellectual  faculties: they are his wants that oblige him to think; that determine  his will, that induce him to act; it is to satisfy them or rather to  put an end to the painful sensations excited by their presence, that  according to his capacity, to the natural sensibility of his soul,  to the energies which are peculiar to himself, he gives play to his  faculties, exerts the activity of his bodily strength, or displays the  extensive powers of his mind. His wants being perpetual, he is obliged  to labour without relaxation, to procure objects competent to satisfy  them. In a word, it is owing to his multiplied wants that man's energy  is kept in a state of continual activity: as soon as he ceases to  have wants, he falls into inaction--becomes listless--declines into  apathy--sinks into a languor that is incommodious to his feelings or  prejudicial to his existence: this lethargic state of weariness lasts  until new wants, by giving him fresh activity, rouse his dormant  faculties--throw off his stupor--re-animate his vigour, and destroy the  sluggishness to which he had become a prey.    From hence it will be obvious that evil is necessary to man; without it  he would neither be in a condition to know that which injures him; to  avoid its presence; or to seek his own welfare: without this stimulus,  he would differ in nothing from insensible, unorganized beings: if those  evanescent evils which he calls _wants_, did not oblige him to call  forth his faculties, to set his energies in motion, to cull experience,  to compare objects, to discriminate them, to separate those which have  the capabilities to injure him, from those which possess the means  to benefit him, he would be insensible to happiness--inadequate to  enjoyment. In short, _without evil man would be ignorant of good_; he  would be continually exposed to perish like the leaf on a tree. He would  resemble an infant, who, destitute of experience, runs the risque of  meeting his destruction at every step he takes, unguarded by his nurse.  What the nurse is to the child, experience is to the adult; when either  are wanting, these children of different lustres generally go astray:  frequently encounter disaster. Without evil he would be unable to judge  of any thing; he would have no preference; his will would be without  volition, he would be destitute of passions; desire would find no place  in his heart; he would not revolt at the most disgusting objects; he  would not strive to put them away; he would neither have stimuli  to love, nor motives to fear any thing; he would be an insensible  automaton; he would no longer be a man.    If no evil had existed in this world, man would never have dreamt of  those numerous divinities, to whom he has rendered such various modes  of worship. If nature had permitted him easily to satisfy all his  regenerating wants, if she had given him none but agreeable sensations,  his days would have uninterruptedly rolled on in one perpetual  uniformity; he would never have discovered his own nakedness; he would  never have had motives to search after the unknown causes of things--to  meditate in pain. Therefore man, always contented, would only have  occupied himself with satisfying his wants; with enjoying the present,  with feeling the influence of objects, that would unceasingly warn him  of his existence in a mode that he must necessarily approve; nothing  would alarm his heart; every thing would be analogous to his existence:  he would neither know fear, experience distrust, nor have inquietude  for the future: these feelings can only be the consequence of some  troublesome sensation, which must"]]]
