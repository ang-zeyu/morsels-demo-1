Those of you who are boys  will, perhaps, spend a great deal of time in reading Greek books; and the  girls, though they may not learn Greek, will be sure to come across a  great many stories taken from Greek history, and to see, I may say every  day, things which we should not have had if it had not been for these old  Greeks.  You can hardly find a well-written book which has not in it  Greek names, and words, and proverbs; you cannot walk through a great  town without passing Greek buildings; you cannot go into a well-furnished  room without seeing Greek statues and ornaments, even Greek patterns of  furniture and paper; so strangely have these old Greeks left their mark  behind them upon this modern world in which we now live.  And as you grow  up, and read more and more, you will find that we owe to these old Greeks  the beginners of all our mathematics and geometry--that is, the science  and knowledge of numbers, and of the shapes of things, and of the forces  which make things move and stand at rest; and the beginnings of our  geography and astronomy; and of our laws, and freedom, and politics--that  is, the science of how to rule a country, and make it peaceful and  strong.  And we owe to them, too, the beginning of our logic--that is,  the study of words and of reasoning; and of our metaphysics--that is, the  study of our own thoughts and souls.  And last of all, they made their  language so beautiful that foreigners used to take to it instead of their  own; and at last Greek became the common language of educated people all  over the old world, from Persia and Egypt even to Spain and Britain.  And  therefore it was that the New Testament was written in Greek, that it  might be read and understood by all the nations of the Roman empire; so  that, next to the Jews, and the Bible which the Jews handed down to us,  we owe more to these old Greeks than to any people upon earth.    Now you must remember one thing--that 'Greeks' was not their real name.  They called themselves always 'Hellens,' but the Romans miscalled them  Greeks; and we have taken that wrong name from the Romans--it would take  a long time to tell you why.  They were made up of many tribes and many  small separate states; and when you hear in this book of Minuai, and  Athenians, and other such names, you must remember that they were all  different tribes and peoples of the one great Hellen race, who lived in  what we now call Greece, in the islands of the Archipelago, and along the  coast of Asia Minor (Ionia, as they call it), from the Hellespont to  Rhodes, and had afterwards colonies and cities in Sicily, and South Italy  (which was called Great Greece), and along the shores of the Black Sea at  Sinope, and Kertch, and at Sevastopol.  And after that, again, they  spread under Alexander the Great, and conquered Egypt, and Syria, and  Persia, and the whole East.  But that was many hundred years after my  stories; for then there were no Greeks on the Black Sea shores, nor in  Sicily, or Italy, or anywhere but in Greece and in Ionia.  And if you are  puzzled by the names of places in this book, you must take the maps and  find them out.  It will be a pleasanter way of learning geography than  out of a dull lesson-book.    Now, I love these old Hellens heartily; and I should be very ungrateful  to them if I did not, considering all that they have taught me; and they  seem to me like brothers, though they have all been dead and gone many  hundred years ago.  So as you must learn about them, whether you choose  or not, I wish to be the first to introduce you to them, and to say,  'Come hither, children, at this blessed Christmas time, when all God's  creatures should rejoice together, and bless Him who redeemed them all.  Come and see old friends of mine, whom I knew long ere you were born.  They are come to visit us at Christmas, out of the world where all live  to God; and to tell you some of their old fairy tales, which they loved  when they were young like you.'    For nations begin at first by being children like you, though they are  made up of grown men.  They are children at first like you--men and women  with children's hearts; frank, and affectionate, and full of trust, and  teachable, and loving to see and learn all the wonders round them; and  greedy also, too often, and passionate and silly, as children are.    Thus these old Greeks were teachable, and learnt from all the nations  round.  From the Phoenicians they learnt shipbuilding, and some say  letters beside; and from the Assyrians they learnt painting, and carving,  and building in wood and stone; and from the Egyptians they learnt  astronomy, and many things which you would not understand.  In this they  were like our own forefathers the Northmen, of whom you love to hear,  who, though they were wild and rough themselves, were humble, and glad to  learn from every one.  Therefore God rewarded these Greeks, as He  rewarded our forefathers, and made them wiser than the people who taught  them in everything they learnt; for He loves to see men and children  open-hearted, and willing to be taught; and to him who uses what he has  got, He gives more and more day by day.  So these Greeks grew wise and  powerful, and wrote poems which will live till the world's end, which you  must read for yourselves some day, in English at least, if not in Greek.  And they learnt to carve statues, and build temples, which are still  among the wonders of the world; and many another wondrous thing God  taught them, for which we are the wiser this day.    For you must not fancy, children, that because these old Greeks were  heathens, therefore God did not care for them, and taught them nothing.    The Bible tells us that it was not so, but that God's mercy is over all  His works, and that He understands the hearts of all people, and fashions  all their works.  And St. Paul told these old Greeks in after times, when  they had grown wicked and fallen low, that they ought to have known  better, because they were God's offspring, as their own poets had said;  and that the good God had put them where they were, to seek the Lord, and  feel after Him, and find Him, though He was not far from any one of them.  And Clement of Alexandria, a great Father of the Church, who was as wise  as he was good, said that God had sent down Philosophy to the Greeks from  heaven, as He sent down the Gospel to the Jews.    For Jesus Christ, remember, is the Light who lights every man who comes  into the world.  And no one can think a right thought, or feel a right  feeling, or understand the real truth of anything in earth and heaven,  unless the good Lord Jesus teaches him by His Spirit, which gives man  understanding.    But these Greeks, as St. Paul told them, forgot what God had taught them,  and, though they were God's offspring, worshipped idols of wood and  stone, and fell at last into sin and shame, and then, of course, into  cowardice and slavery, till they perished out of that beautiful land  which God had given them for so many years.    For, like all nations who have left anything behind them, beside mere  mounds of earth, they believed at first in the One True God who made all  heaven and earth. But after a while, like all other nations, they began  to worship other gods, or rather angels and spirits, who (so they  fancied) lived about their land.  Zeus, the Father of gods and men (who  was some dim remembrance of the blessed true God), and Hera his wife, and  Phoebus Apollo the Sun-god, and Pallas Athene who taught men wisdom and  useful arts, and Aphrodite the Queen of Beauty, and Poseidon the Ruler of  the Sea, and Hephaistos the King of the Fire, who taught men to work in  metals.  And they honoured the Gods of the Rivers, and the Nymph-maids,  who they fancied lived in the caves, and the fountains, and the glens of  the forest, and all beautiful wild places.  And they honoured the  Erinnues, the dreadful sisters, who, they thought, haunted guilty men  until their sins were purged away.  And many other dreams they had, which  parted the One God into many; and they said, too, that these gods did  things which would be a shame and sin for any man to do.  And when their  philosophers arose, and told them that God was One, they would not  listen, but loved their idols, and their wicked idol feasts, till they  all came to ruin.  But we will talk of such sad things no more.    But, at the time of which this little book speaks, they had not fallen as  low as that.  They worshipped no idols, as far as I can find; and they  still believed in the last six of the ten commandments, and knew well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#1)"],[1,"ROBBERS.                  By Frederich Schiller          SCHILLER'S PREFACE.    AS PREFIXED TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THE ROBBERS    PUBLISHED IN 1781.    Now first translated into English.    This play is to be regarded merely as a dramatic narrative in which, for  the purpose of tracing out the innermost workings of the soul, advantage  has been taken of the dramatic method, without otherwise conforming to  the stringent rules of theatrical composition, or seeking the dubious  advantage of stage adaptation. It must be admitted as somewhat  inconsistent that three very remarkable people, whose acts are dependent  on perhaps a thousand contingencies, should be completely developed  within three hours, considering that it would scarcely be possible, in  the ordinary course of events, that three such remarkable people should,  even in twenty-four hours, fully reveal their characters to the most  penetrating inquirer. A greater amount of incident is here crowded  together than it was possible for me to confine within the narrow limits  prescribed by Aristotle and Batteux.    It is, however, not so much the bulk of my play as its contents which  banish it from the stage. Its scheme and economy require that several  characters should appear who would offend the finer feelings of virtue  and shock the delicacy of our manners. Every delineator of human  character is placed in the same dilemma if he proposes to give a  faithful picture of the world as it really is, and not an ideal  phantasy, a mere creation of his own. It is the course of mortal things  that the good should be shadowed by the bad, and virtue shine the  brightest when contrasted with vice. Whoever proposes to discourage  vice and to vindicate religion, morality, and social order against their  enemies, must unveil crime in all its deformity, and place it before the  eyes of men in its colossal magnitude; he must diligently explore its  dark mazes, and make himself familiar with sentiments at the wickedness  of which his soul revolts.    Vice is here exposed in its innermost workings. In Francis it resolves  all the confused terrors of conscience into wild abstractions, destroys  virtuous sentiments by dissecting them, and holds up the earnest voice  of religion to mockery and scorn. He who has gone so far (a distinction  by no means enviable) as to quicken his understanding at the expense of  his soul--to him the holiest things are no longer holy; to him God and  man are alike indifferent, and both worlds are as nothing. Of such a  monster I have endeavored to sketch a striking and lifelike portrait,  to hold up to abhorrence all the machinery of his scheme of vice, and to  test its strength by contrasting it with truth. How far my narrative is  successful in accomplishing these objects the reader is left to judge.  My conviction is that I have painted nature to the life.    Next to this man (Francis) stands another who would perhaps puzzle not  a few of my readers. A mind for which the greatest crimes have only  charms through the glory which attaches to them, the energy which their  perpetration requires, and the dangers which attend them. A remarkable  and important personage, abundantly endowed with the power of becoming  either a Brutus or a Catiline, according as that power is directed. An  unhappy conjunction of circumstances determines him to choose the latter  for, his example, and it is only after a fearful straying that he is  recalled to emulate the former. Erroneous notions of activity and  power, an exuberance of strength which bursts through all the barriers  of law, must of necessity conflict with the rules of social life. To  these enthusiast dreams of greatness and efficiency it needed but a  sarcastic bitterness against the unpoetic spirit of the age to complete  the strange Don Quixote whom, in the Robber Moor, we at once detest and  love, admire and pity. It is, I hope, unnecessary to remark that I no  more hold up this picture as a warning exclusively to robbers than the  greatest Spanish satire was levelled exclusively at knight-errants.    It is nowadays so much the fashion to be witty at the expense of  religion that a man will hardly pass for a genius if he does not allow  his impious satire to run a tilt at its most sacred truths. The noble  simplicity of holy writ must needs be abused and turned into ridicule at  the daily assemblies of the so-called wits; for what is there so holy  and serious that will not raise a laugh if a false sense be attached to  it? Let me hope that I shall have rendered no inconsiderable service  to the cause of true religion and morality in holding up these wanton  misbelievers to the detestation of society, under the form of the most  despicable robbers.    But still more. I have made these said immoral characters to stand out  favorably in particular points, and even in some measure to compensate  by qualities of the head for what they are deficient in those of the  heart. Herein I have done no more than literally copy nature. Every  man, even the most depraved, bears in some degree the impress of the  Almighty's image, and perhaps the greatest villain is not farther  removed from the most upright man than the petty offender; for the moral  forces keep even pace with the powers of the mind, and the greater the  capacity bestowed on man, the greater and more enormous becomes his  misapplication of it; the more responsible is he for his errors.    The \"Adramelech\" of Klopstock (in his Messiah) awakens in us a feeling  in which admiration is blended with detestation. We follow Milton's  Satan with shuddering wonder through the pathless realms of chaos. The  Medea of the old dramatists is, in spite of all her crimes, a great and  wondrous woman, and Shakespeare's Richard III. is sure to excite the  admiration of the reader, much as he would hate the reality. If it is  to be my task to portray men as they are, I must at the same time  include their good qualities, of which even the most vicious are never  totally destitute. If I would warn mankind against the tiger, I must  not omit to describe his glossy, beautifully-marked skin, lest, owing to  this omission, the ferocious animal should not be recognized till too  late. Besides this, a man who is so utterly depraved as to be without a  single redeeming point is no meet subject for art, and would disgust  rather than excite the interest of the reader; who would turn over with  impatience the pages which concern him. A noble soul can no more endure  a succession of moral discords than the musical ear the grating of  knives upon glass.    And for this reason I should have been ill-advised in attempting to  bring my drama on the stage. A certain strength of mind is required  both on the part of the poet and the reader; in the former that he may  not disguise vice, in the latter that he may not suffer brilliant  qualities to beguile him into admiration of what is essentially  detestable. Whether the author has fulfilled his duty he leaves others  to judge, that his readers will perform theirs he by no means feels  assured. The vulgar--among whom I would not be understood to mean  merely the rabble--the vulgar I say (between ourselves) extend their  influence far around, and unfortunately--set the fashion. Too  shortsighted to reach my full meaning, too narrow-minded to comprehend  the largeness of my views, too disingenuous to admit my moral aim--they  will, I fear, almost frustrate my good intentions, and pretend to  discover in my work an apology for the very vice which it has been my  object to condemn, and will perhaps make the poor poet, to whom anything  rather than justice is usually accorded, responsible for his simplicity.    Thus we have a _Da capo_ of the old story of Democritus and the  Abderitans, and our worthy Hippocrates would needs exhaust whole  plantations of hellebore, were it proposed to remedy this mischief by a  healing decoction.       [This alludes to the fable amusingly recorded by Wieland in his     Geschichte der Abderiten. The Abderitans, who were a byword among     the ancients for their extreme simplicity, are said to have sent     express for Hipocrates to cure their great townsman Democritus,     whom they believed to be out of his senses, because his sayings     were beyond their comprehension. Hippocrates, on conversing with     Democritus, having at once discovered that the cause lay with     themselves, assembled the senate and principal inhabitants in the     market-place with the promise of instructing them in the cure of     Democritus. He then banteringly advised them to import six     shiploads of hellebore of the very best quality, and on its arrival     to distribute it among the citizens, at least seven pounds per     head, but to the senators double that quantity, as they were bound     to have an extra supply of sense. By the time these worthies     discovered that they had been laughed at, Hippocrates was out of     their reach. The story in Wieland is infinitely more amusing than     this short quotation from memory enables me to show.  H. G. B.]    Let as many friends of truth as you will, instruct their fellow-citizens  in the pulpit and on the stage, the vulgar will never cease to be  vulgar, though the sun and moon may change their course, and \"heaven and  earth wax old as a garment.\" Perhaps, in order to please tender-hearted  people, I might have been less true to nature; but if a certain beetle,  of whom we have all heard, could extract filth even from pearls, if we  have examples that fire has destroyed and water deluged, shall therefore  pearls, fire, and water be condemned. In consequence of the remarkable  catastrophe which ends my play, I may justly claim for it a place among  books of morality, for crime meets at last with the punishment it  deserves; the lost one enters again within the pale of the law, and  virtue is triumphant.
