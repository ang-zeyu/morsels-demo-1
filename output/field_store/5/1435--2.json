One is a picture book--16 full-color illustrations by Philip  Dadd described in verse by John W. Houghton. The other is a humorous  novel by P. G. Wodehouse, based on the picture book. The novel has a  lengthier storyline, a more intricate plot, and more characterization.  The bound volume intermingled the picture book with the novel,  illustrations and poems appearing at regular intervals. Most pictures  and verses were distant from the page of the novel that they reflected.    For this text version, placeholders for the illustrations (with plate  numbers) have been inserted following the paragraph in the novel that  describes the events being illustrated. The verse descriptions of the  illustrations, labelled with plate numbers, have been moved to the end  of the novel, so as not to disrupt the story. Each verse also has an  illustration placeholder that includes the phrase from the novel shown  as a description on the List of Illustrations.]      [Illustration: Frontispiece]              WILLIAM TELL TOLD AGAIN          BY P.

Tell's tale we tell again--an act         For which pray no one scold us--       This tale of Tell we tell, in fact,         As this Tell tale was told us.            WILLIAM TELL          CHAPTER I      Once upon a time, more years ago than anybody can remember, before the  first hotel had been built or the first Englishman had taken a  photograph of Mont Blanc and brought it home to be pasted in an album  and shown after tea to his envious friends, Switzerland belonged to the  Emperor of Austria, to do what he liked with.    One of the first things the Emperor did was to send his friend Hermann  Gessler to govern the country. Gessler was not a nice man, and it soon  became plain that he would never make himself really popular with the  Swiss. The point on which they disagreed in particular was the question  of taxes. The Swiss, who were a simple and thrifty people, objected to  paying taxes of any sort. They said they wanted to spend their money on  all kinds of other things. Gessler, on the other hand, wished to put a  tax on everything, and, being Governor, he did it. He made everyone who  owned a flock of sheep pay a certain sum of money to him; and if the  farmer sold his sheep and bought cows, he had to pay rather more money  to Gessler for the cows than he had paid for the sheep. Gessler also  taxed bread, and biscuits, and jam, and buns, and lemonade, and, in  fact, everything he could think of, till the people of Switzerland  determined to complain. They appointed Walter Fuerst, who had red hair  and looked fierce; Werner Stauffacher, who had gray hair and was always  wondering how he ought to pronounce his name; and Arnold of Melchthal,  who had light-yellow hair and was supposed to know a great deal about  the law, to make the complaint. They called on the Governor one lovely  morning in April, and were shown into the Hall of Audience.    \"Well,\" said Gessler, \"and what's the matter now?\"    The other two pushed Walter Fuerst forward because he looked fierce, and  they thought he might frighten the Governor.    Walter Fuerst coughed.    \"Well?\" asked Gessler.    \"Er--ahem!\" said Walter Fuerst.    \"That's the way,\" whispered Werner; \"_give_ it him!\"    \"Er--ahem!\"  said Walter Fuerst again; \"the fact is, your Governorship--\"    \"It's a small point,\" interrupted Gessler, \"but I'm generally called  'your Excellency.' Yes?\"    \"The fact is, your Excellency, it seems to the people of Switzerland--\"    \"--Whom I represent,\" whispered Arnold of Melchthal.    \"--Whom I represent, that things want changing.\"    \"What things?\" inquired Gessler.    \"The taxes, your excellent Governorship.\"    \"Change the taxes? Why, don't the people of Switzerland think there are  enough taxes?\"    Arnold of Melchthal broke in hastily.    \"They think there are many too many,\" he said. \"What with the tax on  sheep, and the tax on cows, and the tax on bread, and the tax on tea,  and the tax--\"    \"I know, _I_ know,\" Gessler interrupted; \"I know all the taxes.  Come to the point. What about 'em?\"    \"Well, your Excellency, there are too many of them.\"    \"Too many!\"    \"Yes. And we are not going to put up with it any longer!\" shouted  Arnold of Melchthal.    Gessler leaned forward in his throne.    \"Might I ask you to repeat that remark?\" he said.    \"We are not going to put up with it any longer!\"    Gessler sat back again with an ugly smile.    \"Oh,\" he said--\"oh, indeed! You aren't, aren't you! Desire the Lord  High Executioner to step this way,\" he added to a soldier who stood  beside him.    The Lord High Executioner entered the presence. He was a kind-looking  old gentleman with white hair, and he wore a beautiful black robe,  tastefully decorated with death's-heads.    \"Your Excellency sent for me?\" he said.    \"Just so,\" replied Gessler. \"This gentleman here\"--he pointed to Arnold  of Melchthal--\"says he does not like taxes, and that he isn't going to  put up with them any longer.\"    \"Tut-tut!\" murmured the executioner.    \"See what you can do for him.\"    \"Certainly, your Excellency. Robert,\" he cried, \"is the oil on the  boil?\"    \"Just this minute boiled over,\" replied a voice from the other side of  the door.    \"Then bring it in, and mind you don't spill any.\"    Enter Robert, in a suit of armour and a black mask, carrying a large  caldron, from which the steam rose in great clouds.    \"Now, sir, if you please,\" said the executioner politely to Arnold of  Melchthal.    Arnold looked at the caldron.    \"Why, it's hot,\" he said.    \"Warmish,\" admitted the executioner.    \"It's against the law to threaten a man with hot oil.\"    [Illustration: PLATE I]    \"You may bring an action against me,\" said the executioner. \"Now, sir,  if _you_ please. We are wasting time. The forefinger of your left  hand, if I may trouble you. Thank you. I am obliged.\"    He took Arnold's left hand, and dipped the tip of the first finger into  the oil.    \"Ow!\" cried Arnold, jumping.    \"Don't let him see he's hurting you,\" whispered Werner Stauffacher.  \"Pretend you don't notice it.\"    Gessler leaned forward again.    \"Have your views on taxes changed at all?\" he asked. \"Do you see my  point of view more clearly now?\"    Arnold admitted that he thought that, after all, there might be  something to be said for it.    \"That's right,\" said the Governor. \"And the tax on sheep? You don't  object to that?\"    \"No.\"    \"And the tax on cows?\"    \"I like it.\"    \"And those on bread, and buns, and lemonade?\"    \"I enjoy them.\"    \"Excellent. In fact, you're quite contented?\"    \"Quite.\"    \"And you think the rest of the people are?\"    \"Oh, quite, quite!\"    \"And do you think the same?\" he asked of Walter and Werner.    \"Oh _yes_, your Excellency!\" they cried.    \"Then _that's_ all right,\" said Gessler. \"I was sure you would be  sensible about it. Now, if you will kindly place in the tambourine  which the gentleman on my left is presenting to you a mere trifle to  compensate us for our trouble in giving you an audience, and if you\"  (to Arnold of Melchthal) \"will contribute an additional trifle for use  of the Imperial boiling oil, I think we shall all be satisfied. You've  done it? _That's_ right. Good-bye, and mind the step as you go  out.\"    And, as he finished this speech, the three spokesmen of the people of  Switzerland were shown out of the Hall of Audience.          CHAPTER II      They were met in the street outside by a large body of their  fellow-citizens, who had accompanied them to the Palace, and who had  been spending the time since their departure in listening by turns at  the keyhole of the front-door. But as the Hall of Audience was at the  other side of the Palace, and cut off from the front-door by two other  doors, a flight of stairs, and a long passage, they had not heard very  much of what had gone on inside, and they surrounded the three spokesmen  as they came out, and questioned them eagerly.    \"Has he taken off the tax on jam?\" asked Ulric the smith.    \"What is he going to do about the tax on mixed biscuits?\" shouted Klaus  von der Flue, who was a chimney-sweep of the town and loved mixed  biscuits.    \"Never mind about tea and mixed biscuits!\" cried his neighbour, Meier  of Sarnen. \"What I want to know is whether we shall have to pay for  keeping sheep any more.\"    \"What _did_ the Governor say?\" asked Jost Weiler, a practical man,  who liked to go straight to the point."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#1)"],[1,"Red Badge of Courage    Stephen Crane (1871-1900)    An Episode of the American Civil War          Chapter 1    The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs  revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting.  As the landscape  changed from brown to green, the army awakened, and began to tremble  with eagerness at the noise of rumors.  It cast its eyes upon the  roads, which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper  thoroughfares.  A river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks,  purled at the army's feet; and at night, when the stream had become of  a sorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eyelike gleam  of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills.    Once a certain tall soldier developed virtues and went resolutely to  wash a shirt.  He came flying back from a brook waving his garment  bannerlike.  He was swelled with a tale he had heard from a reliable  friend, who had heard it from a truthful cavalryman, who had heard it  from his trustworthy brother, one of the orderlies at division  headquarters.  He adopted the important air of a herald in red and gold.    \"We're goin' t' move t'morrah--sure,\" he said pompously to a group in  the company street.  \"We're goin' 'way up the river, cut across, an'  come around in behint 'em.\"    To his attentive audience he drew a loud and elaborate plan of a very  brilliant campaign.  When he had finished, the blue-clothed men  scattered into small arguing groups between the rows of squat brown  huts.  A negro teamster who had been dancing upon a cracker box with  the hilarious encouragement of twoscore soldiers was deserted.  He sat  mournfully down.  Smoke drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint  chimneys.    \"It's a lie!  that's all it is--a thunderin' lie!\" said another private  loudly.  His smooth face was flushed, and his hands were thrust sulkily  into his trouser's pockets.  He took the matter as an affront to him.  \"I don't believe the derned old army's ever going to move.  We're set.  I've got ready to move eight times in the last two weeks, and we ain't  moved yet.\"    The tall soldier felt called upon to defend the truth of a rumor he  himself had introduced.  He and the loud one came near to fighting over  it.    A corporal began to swear before the assemblage.  He had just put a  costly board floor in his house, he said.  During the early spring he  had refrained from adding extensively to the comfort of his environment  because he had felt that the army might start on the march at any  moment.  Of late, however, he had been impressed that they were in a  sort of eternal camp.    Many of the men engaged in a spirited debate.  One outlined in a  peculiarly lucid manner all the plans of the commanding general.  He  was opposed by men who advocated that there were other plans of  campaign.  They clamored at each other, numbers making futile bids for  the popular attention.  Meanwhile, the soldier who had fetched the  rumor bustled about with much importance.  He was continually assailed  by questions.    \"What's up, Jim?\"    \"Th'army's goin' t' move.\"    \"Ah, what yeh talkin' about?  How yeh know it is?\"    \"Well, yeh kin b'lieve me er not, jest as yeh like.  I don't care a  hang.\"    There was much food for thought in the manner in which he replied.  He  came near to convincing them by disdaining to produce proofs.  They  grew much excited over it.    There was a youthful private who listened with eager ears to the words  of the tall soldier and to the varied comments of his comrades.  After  receiving a fill of discussions concerning marches and attacks, he went  to his hut and crawled through an intricate hole that served it as a  door.  He wished to be alone with some new thoughts that had lately  come to him.    He lay down on a wide bunk that stretched across the end of the room.  In the other end, cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture.  They  were grouped about the fireplace.  A picture from an illustrated weekly  was upon the log walls, and three rifles were paralleled on pegs.  Equipments hung on handy projections, and some tin dishes lay upon a  small pile of firewood.  A folded tent was serving as a roof.  The  sunlight, without, beating upon it, made it glow a light yellow shade.  A small window shot an oblique square of whiter light upon the  cluttered floor.  The smoke from the fire at times neglected the clay  chimney and wreathed into the room, and this flimsy chimney of clay and  sticks made endless threats to set ablaze the whole establishment.    The youth was in a little trance of astonishment.  So they were at last  going to fight.  On the morrow, perhaps, there would be a battle, and  he would be in it.  For a time he was obliged to labor to make himself  believe.  He could not accept with assurance an omen that he was about  to mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth.    He had, of course, dreamed of battles all his life--of vague and bloody  conflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire.  In visions  he had seen himself in many struggles.  He had imagined peoples secure  in the shadow of his eagle-eyed prowess.  But awake he had regarded  battles as crimson blotches on the pages of the past.  He had put them  as things of the bygone with his thought-images of heavy crowns and  high castles.  There was a portion of the world's history which he had  regarded as the time of wars, but it, he thought, had been long gone  over the horizon and had disappeared forever.    From his home his youthful eyes had looked upon the war in his own  country with distrust.  It must be some sort of a play affair.  He had  long despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle.  Such would be no  more, he had said.  Men were better, or more timid.  Secular and  religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or else  firm finance held in check the passions.    He had burned several times to enlist.  Tales of great movements shook  the land.  They might not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to be  much glory in them.  He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he  had longed to see it all.  His busy mind had drawn for him large  pictures extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds.    But his mother had discouraged him.  She had affected to look with some  contempt upon the quality of his war ardor and patriotism.  She could  calmly seat herself and with no apparent difficulty give him many  hundreds of reasons why he was of vastly more importance on the farm  than on the field of battle.  She had had certain ways of expression  that told him that her statements on the subject came from a deep  conviction.  Moreover, on her side, was his belief that her ethical  motive in the argument was impregnable.    At last, however, he had made firm rebellion against this yellow light  thrown upon the color of his ambitions.  The newspapers, the gossip of  the village, his own picturings, had aroused him to an uncheckable  degree.  They were in truth fighting finely down there.  Almost every  day the newspaper printed accounts of a decisive victory.    One night, as he lay in bed, the winds had carried to him the  clangoring of the church bell as some enthusiast jerked the rope  frantically to tell the twisted news of a great battle.  This voice of  the people rejoicing in the night had made him shiver in a prolonged  ecstasy of excitement.  Later, he had gone down to his mother's room  and had spoken thus:  \"Ma, I'm going to enlist.\"    \"Henry, don't you be a fool,\" his mother had replied.  She had then  covered her face with the quilt.  There was an end to the matter for  that night.    Nevertheless, the next morning he had gone to a town that was near his  mother's farm and had enlisted in a company that was forming there.  When he had returned home his mother was milking the brindle cow.  Four  others stood waiting.  \"Ma, I've enlisted,\" he had said to her  diffidently.  There was a short silence.  \"The Lord's will be done,  Henry,\" she had finally replied, and had then continued to milk the  brindle cow.    When he had stood in the doorway with his soldier's clothes on his  back, and with the light of excitement and expectancy in his eyes  almost defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds, he had seen two  tears leaving their trails on his mother's scarred cheeks.    Still, she had disappointed him by saying nothing whatever about  returning with his shield or on it.  He had privately primed himself  for a beautiful scene.  He had prepared certain sentences which he  thought could be used with touching effect.  But her words destroyed  his plans.  She had doggedly peeled potatoes and addressed him as  follows:  \"You watch out, Henry, an' take good care of yerself in this  here fighting business--you watch, an' take good care of yerself.  Don't go a-thinkin' you can lick the hull rebel army at the start,  because yeh can't.  Yer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot of  others, and yeh've got to keep quiet an' do what they tell yeh.  I know  how you are, Henry.    \"I've knet yeh eight pair of socks, Henry, and I've put in all yer best  shirts, because I want my boy to be jest as warm and comf'able as  anybody in the army.  Whenever they get holes in 'em, I want yeh to  send 'em right-away back to me, so's I kin dern 'em.    \"An' allus be careful an' choose yer comp'ny.  There's lots of bad men  in the army, Henry.  The army makes 'em wild, and they like nothing  better than the job of leading off a young feller like you, as ain't  never been away from home much and has allus had a mother, an'  a-learning 'em to drink and swear.  Keep clear of them folks, Henry.  I  don't want yeh to ever do anything, Henry, that yeh would be 'shamed to  let me know about.  Jest think as if I was a-watchin' yeh.  If yeh keep  that in yer mind allus, I guess yeh'll come out about right.    \"Yeh must allus remember yer father, too, child, an'"]]]
