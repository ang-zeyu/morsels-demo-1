Joy may be said to  predominate, but with the joy comes also uncertainty. Are these people,  he asks himself, proposing to set up as farmers of a large scale, or do  they merely want the seed to give verisimilitude to their otherwise bald  and unconvincing raspberry jam? On the solution of this problem  depends the important matter of price, for, obviously, you can charge  a fraudulent jam disseminator in a manner which an honest farmer would  resent.    This was the problem which was furrowing the brow of Mr. Julian  Fineberg, of Bury St. Edwards, one sunny morning when Roland Bleke  knocked at his door; and such was its difficulty that only at the  nineteenth knock did Mr. Fineberg raise his head.    \"Come in--that dashed woodpecker out there!\" he shouted, for it was his  habit to express himself with a generous strength towards the junior  members of his staff.    The young man who entered looked exactly like a second clerk in a  provincial seed-merchant's office--which, strangely enough, he chanced  to be. His chief characteristic was an intense ordinariness. He was a  young man; and when you had said that of him you had said everything.  There was nothing which you would have noticed about him, except the  fact that there was nothing to notice. His age was twenty-two and his  name was Roland Bleke.    \"Please, sir, it's about my salary.\"    Mr. Fineberg, at the word, drew himself together much as a British  square at Waterloo must have drawn itself together at the sight of a  squadron of cuirassiers.    \"Salary?\" he cried. \"What about it? What's the matter with it? You get  it, don't you?\"    \"Yes, sir, but----\"    \"Well? Don't stand there like an idiot. What is it?\"    \"It's too much.\"    Mr. Fineberg's brain reeled. It was improbable that the millennium could  have arrived with a jerk; on the other hand, he had distinctly heard  one of his clerks complain that his salary was too large. He pinched  himself.    \"Say that again,\" he said.    \"If you could see your way to reduce it, sir----\"    It occurred to Mr. Fineberg for one instant that his subordinate was  endeavoring to be humorous, but a glance at Roland's face dispelled that  idea.    \"Why do you want it reduced?\"    \"Please, sir, I'm going to be married.\"    \"What the deuce do you mean?\"    \"When my salary reaches a hundred and fifty, sir. And it's a hundred and  forty now, so if you could see your way to knocking off ten pounds----\"    Mr. Fineberg saw light. He was a married man himself.    \"My boy,\" he said genially, \"I quite understand. But I can do you better  than that. It's no use doing this sort of thing in a small way. From now  on your salary is a hundred and ten. No, no, don't thank me. You're an  excellent clerk, and it's a pleasure to me to reward merit when I find  it. Close the door after you.\"    And Mr. Fineberg returned with a lighter heart to the great clover-seed  problem.    The circumstances which had led Roland to approach his employer may  be briefly recounted. Since joining the staff of Mr. Fineberg, he had  lodged at the house of a Mr. Coppin, in honorable employment as porter  at the local railway-station. The Coppin family, excluding domestic  pets, consisted of Mr. Coppin, a kindly and garrulous gentleman of  sixty, Mrs. Coppin, a somewhat negative personality, most of whose life  was devoted to cooking and washing up in her underground lair, Brothers  Frank and Percy, gentleman of leisure, popularly supposed to be engaged  in the mysterious occupation known as \"lookin' about for somethin',\"  and, lastly, Muriel.    For some months after his arrival, Muriel had been to Roland Bleke  a mere automaton, a something outside himself that was made only for  neatly-laid breakfast tables and silent removal of plates at dinner.  Gradually, however, when his natural shyness was soothed by use  sufficiently to enable him to look at her when she came into the room,  he discovered that she was a strikingly pretty girl, bounded to the  North by a mass of auburn hair and to the South by small and shapely  feet. She also possessed what, we are informed--we are children in these  matters ourselves--is known as the R. S. V. P. eye. This eye had met  Roland's one evening, as he chumped his chop, and before he knew what he  was doing he had remarked that it had been a fine day.    From that wonderful moment matters had developed at an incredible speed.  Roland had a nice sense of the social proprieties, and he could not  bring himself to ignore a girl with whom he had once exchanged easy  conversation about the weather. Whenever she came to lay his table, he  felt bound to say something. Not being an experienced gagger, he found  it more and more difficult each evening to hit on something bright,  until finally, from sheer lack of inspiration, he kissed her.    If matters had progressed rapidly before, they went like lightning then.  It was as if he had touched a spring or pressed a button, setting vast  machinery in motion. Even as he reeled back stunned at his audacity, the  room became suddenly full of Coppins of every variety known to science.  Through a mist he was aware of Mrs. Coppin crying in a corner, of  Mr. Coppin drinking his health in the remains of sparkling limado,  of Brothers Frank and Percy, one on each side trying to borrow  simultaneously half-crowns, and of Muriel, flushed but demure, making  bread-pellets and throwing them in an abstracted way, one by one, at the  Coppin cat, which had wandered in on the chance of fish.    Out of the chaos, as he stood looking at them with his mouth open, came  the word \"bans,\" and smote him like a blast of East wind.    It is not necessary to trace in detail Roland's mental processes from  that moment till the day when he applied to Mr. Fineberg for a  reduction of salary. It is enough to say that for quite a month he was  extraordinarily happy. To a man who has had nothing to do with women, to  be engaged is an intoxicating experience, and at first life was one  long golden glow to Roland. Secretly, like all mild men, he had always  nourished a desire to be esteemed a nut by his fellow men; and his  engagement satisfied that desire. It was pleasant to hear Brothers  Frank and Percy cough knowingly when he came in. It was pleasant to walk  abroad with a girl like Muriel in the capacity of the accepted wooer.  Above all, it was pleasant to sit holding Muriel's hand and watching the  ill-concealed efforts of Mr. Albert Potter to hide his mortification.  Albert was a mechanic in the motor-works round the corner, and hitherto  Roland had always felt something of a worm in his presence. Albert was  so infernally strong and silent and efficient. He could dissect a car  and put it together again. He could drive through the thickest traffic.  He could sit silent in company without having his silence attributed to  shyness or imbecility. But--he could not get engaged to Muriel Coppin.  That was reserved for Roland Bleke, the nut, the dasher, the young man  of affairs. It was all very well being able to tell a spark-plug from a  commutator at sight, but when it came to a contest in an affair of the  heart with a man like Roland, Albert was in his proper place, third at  the pole.    Probably, if he could have gone on merely being engaged, Roland would  never have wearied of the experience. But the word marriage began to  creep more and more into the family conversation, and suddenly panic  descended upon Roland Bleke.    All his life he had had a horror of definite appointments. An invitation  to tea a week ahead had been enough to poison life for him. He was one  of those young men whose souls revolt at the thought of planning out any  definite step. He could do things on the spur of the moment, but plans  made him lose his nerve.    By the end of the month his whole being was crying out to him in  agonized tones: \"Get me out of this. Do anything you like, but get me  out of this frightful marriage business.\"    If anything had been needed to emphasize his desire for freedom, the  attitude of Frank and Percy would have supplied it. Every day they made  it clearer that the man who married Muriel would be no stranger to them.  It would be his pleasing task to support them, too, in the style to  which they had become accustomed. They conveyed the idea that they went  with Muriel as a sort of bonus.           *       *       *       *       *    The Coppin family were at high tea when Roland reached home. There was  a general stir of interest as he entered the room, for it was known that  he had left that morning with the intention of approaching Mr. Fineberg  on the important matter of a rise in salary. Mr. Coppin removed his  saucer of tea from his lips. Frank brushed the tail of a sardine from  the corner of his mouth. Percy ate his haddock in an undertone. Albert  Potter, who was present, glowered silently.    Roland shook his head with the nearest approach to gloom which his  rejoicing heart would permit.    \"I'm afraid I've bad news.\"    Mrs. Coppin burst into tears, her invariable practise in any crisis.  Albert Potter's face relaxed into something resembling a smile.    \"He won't give you your raise?\"    Roland sighed.    \"He's reduced me.\"    \"Reduced you!\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#1)"],[1,"AMBER WITCH    by    Wilhelm Meinhold      The most interesting trial for witchcraft ever known. Printed from an  imperfect manuscript by her father Abraham Schweidler, the pastor of  Coserow, in the Island of Usedom.      Translated from the German by Lady Duff Gordon.    Original publication date: 1846.          PREFACE      In laying before the public this deeply affecting and romantic trial,  which I have not without reason called on the title-page the most  interesting of all trials for witchcraft ever known, I will first give  some account of the history of the manuscript.    At Coserow, in the Island of Usedom, my former cure, the same which was  held by our worthy author some two hundred years ago, there existed  under a seat in the choir of the church a sort of niche, nearly on a  level with the floor. I had, indeed, often seen a heap of various  writings in this recess; but owing to my short sight, and the darkness  of the place, I had taken them for antiquated hymn-books, which were  lying about in great numbers. But one day, while I was teaching in the  church, I looked for a paper mark in the Catechism of one of the boys,  which I could not immediately find; and my old sexton, who was past  eighty (and who, although called Appelmann, was thoroughly unlike his  namesake in our story, being a very worthy, although a most ignorant  man), stooped down to the said niche, and took from it a folio volume  which I had never before observed, out of which he, without the slightest  hesitation, tore a strip of paper suited to my purpose, and reached it to  me. I immediately seized upon the book, and, after a few minutes' perusal,  I know not which was greater, my astonishment or my vexation at this  costly prize. The manuscript, which was bound in vellum, was not only  defective both at the beginning and at the end, but several leaves had  even been torn out here and there in the middle. I scolded the old man as  I had never done during the whole course of my life; but he excused  himself, saying that one of my predecessors had given him the manuscript  for waste paper, as it had lain about there ever since the memory of man,  and he had often been in want of paper to twist round the altar candles,  etc. The aged and half-blind pastor had mistaken the folio for old  parochial accounts which could be of no more use to any one.[1]    No sooner had I reached home than I fell to work upon my new acquisition,  and after reading a bit here and there with considerable trouble, my  interest was powerfully excited by the contents.    I soon felt the necessity of making myself better acquainted with the  nature and conduct of these witch trials, with the proceedings, nay,  even with the history of the whole period in which these events occur.  But the more I read of these extraordinary stories, the more was I  confounded; and neither the trivial Beeker (_die bezauberte Welt_, the  enchanted world), nor the more careful Horst (_Zauberbibliothek_, the  library of magic), to which, as well as to several other works on the  same subject, I had flown for information, could resolve my doubts, but  rather served to increase them.    Not alone is the demoniacal character, which pervades nearly all these  fearful stories, so deeply marked, as to fill the attentive reader with  feelings of alternate horror and dismay, but the eternal and unchangeable  laws of human feeling and action are often arrested in a manner so  violent and unforeseen, that the understanding is entirely baffled. For  instance, one of the original trials which a friend of mine, a lawyer,  discovered in our province, contains the account of a mother, who, after  she had suffered the torture, and received the holy Sacrament, and was  on the point of going to the stake, so utterly lost all maternal feeling,  that her conscience obliged her to accuse as a witch her only dearly-loved  daughter, a girl of fifteen, against whom no one had ever entertained a  suspicion, in order, as she said, to save her poor soul. The court, justly  amazed at an event which probably has never since been paralleled, caused  the state of the mother's mind to be examined both by clergymen and  physicians, whose original testimonies are still appended to the records,  and are all highly favourable to her soundness of mind. The unfortunate  daughter, whose name was Elizabeth Hegel, was actually executed on the  strength of her mother's accusation.[2]    The explanation commonly received at the present day, that these  phenomena were produced by means of animal magnetism, is utterly  insufficient. How, for instance, could this account for the deeply  demoniacal nature of old Lizzie Kolken as exhibited in the following  pages? It is utterly incomprehensible, and perfectly explains why the  old pastor, notwithstanding the horrible deceits practised on him in  the person of his daughter, retained as firm a faith in the truth of  witchcraft as in that of the Gospel.    During the earlier centuries of the middle ages little was known of  witchcraft. The crime of magic, when it did occur, was leniently  punished. For instance, the Council of Ancyra (314) ordained the whole  punishment of witches to consist in expulsion from the Christian  community. The Visigoths punished them with stripes, and Charlemagne,  by advice of his bishops, confined them in prison until such time as  they should sincerely repent.[3] It was not until very soon before  the Reformation, that Innocent VIII. lamented that the complaints of  universal Christendom against the evil practices of these women had  become so general and so loud, that the most vigorous measures must be  taken against them; and towards the end of the year 1489, he caused the  notorious Hammer for Witches (_Malleus Maleficarum_) to be published,  according to which proceedings were set on foot with the most fanatical  zeal, not only in Catholic, but, strange to say, even in Protestant  Christendom, which in other respects abhorred everything belonging  to Catholicism. Indeed, the Protestants far outdid the Catholics in  cruelty, until, among the latter, the noble-minded Jesuit, J. Spee, and  among the former, but not until seventy years later, the excellent  Thomasius, by degrees put a stop to these horrors.    After careful examination into the nature and characteristics of  witchcraft, I soon perceived that among all these strange and often  romantic stories, not one surpassed my 'amber witch' in lively interest;  and I determined to throw her adventures into the form of a romance.  Fortunately, however, I was soon convinced that her story was already in  itself the most interesting of all romances; and that I should do far  better to leave it in its original antiquated form, omitting whatever  would be uninteresting to modern readers, or so universally known as to  need no repetition. I have therefore attempted, not indeed to supply  what is missing at the beginning and end, but to restore those leaves  which have been torn out of the middle, imitating, as accurately as I  was able, the language and manner of the old biographer, in order that  the difference between the original narrative and my own interpolations  might not be too evident.    This I have done with much trouble, and after many ineffectual attempts;  but I refrain from pointing out the particular passages which I have  supplied, so as not to disturb the historical interest of the greater  part of my readers. For modern criticism, which has now attained to a  degree of acuteness never before equalled, such a confession would be  entirely superfluous, as critics will easily distinguish the passages  where Pastor Schweidler speaks from those written by Pastor Meinhold.    I am, nevertheless, bound to give the public some account of what I have  omitted, namely,--    1st. Such long prayers as were not very remarkable for Christian unction.    2d. Well-known stories out of the Thirty Years' War.    3d. Signs and wonders in the heavens, which were seen here and there,  and which are recorded by other Pomeranian writers of these fearful  times; for instance, by Micraelius.[4] But when these events formed part  of the tale itself, as, for instance, the cross on the Streckelberg, I,  of course, allowed them to stand.    4th. The specification of the whole income of the church at Coserow,  before and during the terrible times of the Thirty Years' War.    5th. The enumeration of the dwellings left standing, after the  devastations made by the enemy in every village throughout the parish.    6th. The names of the districts to which this or that member of the  congregation had emigrated.    7th. A ground plan and description of the old Manse.    I have likewise here and there ventured to make a few changes in the  language, as my author is not always consistent in the use of his words  or in his orthography. The latter I have, however, with very few  exceptions, retained.    And thus I lay before the gracious reader a work, glowing with the fire  of heaven, as well as with that of hell.    MEINHOLD.
