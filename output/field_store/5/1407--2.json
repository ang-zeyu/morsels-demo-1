The leading object had in view in the preparation of the present  volume has been to produce, within a moderate compass, a History  of Greece that shall not only be trustworthy, but interesting  to all classes of readers.    It must be acknowledged that our standard historical works, with  all their worth, do not command a perusal by the people at large;  and it is equally plain that our ordinary School Manuals--the  abridgments and outlines of more voluminous works--do not meet  with any greater favor. The mere outline system of historical  study usually pursued in the schools is interesting to those only  to whom it is suggestive of the details on which it is based; and  we have long been satisfied that it is not the best for beginners  and for popular use; that it inverts the natural order of  acquisition; that for the young to master it is drudgery; that  its statistical enumeration, if ever learned by them, is soon  forgotten; that it tends to create a prejudice against the study  of history; that it does not lay the proper foundation for future  historical reading; and that, outside of the enforced study of  the school-room, it is seldom made use of. The people in general--the  masses--do not read such works, while they do read with avidity  historical legends, historical romances, historical poems and  dramas, and biographical sketches. And we do not hesitate to assert  that from Shakspeare's historical plays the reading public have  acquired (together with much other valuable information) a  hundred-fold more knowledge of certain portions of English history  than from all the ponderous tomes of formal history that have ever  been written. It may be said that people ought to read Hume, and  Lingard, and Mackintosh, and Hallam, and Froude, and Freeman,  instead of Shakspeare's \"King John,\" and \"Richard II.,\" and \"Henry  IV.,\" and \"Henry VIII.,\" etc. It is a sufficient reply to say they  do not.    Historical works, therefore, to be read by the masses, must be  adapted to the popular taste. It was an acknowledgment of this  truth that led Macaulay, the most brilliant of historians, to  remark, \"We are not certain that the best histories are not those  in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative  is judiciously employed. Something is lost in accuracy, but much  is gained in effect. The fainter lines are neglected, but the  great characteristic features are imprinted on the mind forever.\"  If the result to which Macaulay refers be once attained by an  introductory work so interesting that it shall come into general  use, it will, we believe, naturally lead to the reading of some  of the best standard works in the same historical field. In our  attempt to make this a work of such a preparatory character, we  have borne in mind the demand that has arisen for poetic illustration  in the reading and teaching of history, and have given this  delightful aid to historical study a prominent place--ofttimes  making it the sole means of imparting information. And yet we  have introduced nothing that is not strictly consistent with our  ideal of what history should be; for although some of the poetic  selections are avowedly wholly legendary, and others, still, in  a greater or less degree fictitious in their minor details--like  the by-plays in Shakspeare's historic dramas--we believe they do  no violence to historical verity, as they are faithful pictures  of the times, scenes, incidents, principles, and beliefs which  they are employed to illustrate. Aside, too, from their historic  interest, they have a literary value. Many prose selections from  the best historians are also introduced, giving to the narrative  a pleasing variety of style that can be found in no one writer,  even if he be a Grote, a Gibbon, or a Macaulay.           *       *       *        *       *    THE PRINCIPAL HISTORIES OF GREECE.    Believing that it may be of some advantage to the general reader,  we give herewith a brief sketch of the principal histories of  Greece now before the public. We may mention, among those of a  comprehensive character, the works of Goldsmith, Gillies, Mitford,  Thirlwall, Grote, and Curtius:    OLIVER GOLDSMITH, \"the popular poet, the charming novelist, the  successful dramatist, and the witty essayist,\" wrote a popular  history of Greece, in two volumes, 8vo, 1774, embracing a period  from the earliest date down to the death of Alexander the Great.  It is an attractive work, elegantly written, but is superficial  and inaccurate.    In 1786 was published a history of ancient Greece, in several  volumes, by DR. JOHN GILLIES, who succeeded Dr. Robertson as  historiographer of Scotland. This is a work of considerable merit  but it is written in a spirit of decidedly monarchical tendencies,  although the author evidently aimed at great fairness in his  political views.    He says: \"The history of Greece exposes the dangerous turbulence  of democracy, and arraigns the despotism of tyrants. By describing  the incurable evils inherent in every republican policy, it evinces  the inestimable benefits resulting to liberty itself from the  lawful dominion of hereditary kings, and the steady operation  of well-regulated monarchy.\"    In the year 1784 appeared the first volume of WILLIAM MITFORD'S  \"History of Greece\", subsequently extended to eight and ten volumes,  8vo. It is the first history of Greece that combines extensive  research and profound philosophical reflection; but it is \"a  monarchical\" history, by a writer of very strong anti-republican  principles. \"It was composed,\" says Alison, the distinguished  historian of modern Europe, \"during, or shortly after, the French  Revolution; and it was mainly intended to counteract the visionary  ideas in regard to the blessings of Grecian democracy, which had  spread so far in the world, from the magic of Athenian genius.\"  Says Chancellor Kent: \"Mitford does not scruple to tell the truth,  and the whole truth, and to paint the stormy democracies of Greece  in all their grandeur and in all their wretchedness.\" Lord Byron  said of the author: \"His great pleasure consists in praising tyrants,  abusing Plutarch, spelling oddly, and writing quaintly; and--what  is strange, after all--his is the best modern history of Greece  in any language.\" But this was penned before Thirlwall's and Grote's  histories were published. Lord Macaulay says of Mitford: \"Whenever  this historian mentions Demosthenes he violates all the laws of  candor and even of decency: he weighs no authorities, he makes  no allowances, he forgets the best authenticated facts in the  history of the times, and the most generally recognized principles  of human nature.\" The North British Review, after calling Mitford  \"a bad scholar, a bad historian, and a bad writer of English,\"  says, farther, that \"he was the first writer of any note who found  out that Grecian history was a living thing with a practical  bearing.\"    The next truly important and comprehensive Grecian history,  published from 1835 to 1840, in eight volumes, 8vo, was written  by CONNOP THIRLWALL, D. D., Bishop of St. David's. It is a scholarly,  elaborate, and philosophical work evincing a thorough knowledge  of Greek literature and of the German commentators. The historian  Grote said that, if it had appeared a few years earlier, he should  probably never have undertaken his own history of Greece. \"I  should certainly,\" he says, \"not have been prompted to the task  by any deficiencies such as those I felt and regretted in Mitford.\"    In comparing Thirlwall's history with Grote's, the North British  Review has the following judicious remarks: \"Many persons, probably,  who have no special devotion to Grecian history wish to study its  main outlines in something higher than a mere school-book. To  such readers we should certainly recommend Thirlwall rather than  Grote. The comparative brevity, the greater clearness and terseness  of the narrative, the freedom from diversions and digressions,  all render it far better suited for such a purpose. But for the  political thinker, who regards Grecian history chiefly in its  practical bearing, Mr. Grote's work is far better adapted. The  one is the work of a scholar, an enlarged and practical scholar  indeed, but still one in whom the character of the scholar is  the primary one. The other is the work of a politician and man  of business, a London banker, a Radical M. P., whose devotion  to ancient history and literature forms the most illustrious  confutation of the charges brought against such studies as being  useless and impractical.\"    \"The style of Thirlwall,\" says Dr. Samuel Warren of England, in  his Introduction to Law Studies, \"is dry, terse, and exact--not  fitted, perhaps, for the historical tyro, but most acceptable  to the advanced student who is in quest of things.\"    GEORGE GROTE, Member of Parliament, and a London banker, who  wrote a history of Greece in twelve volumes, published from 1846  to 1855, has been styled, by way of eminence, the historian of  Greece, because his work is universally admitted by critics to  be the best for the advanced student that has yet been written.  The London Athenaeum styles his history \"a great literary undertaking,  equally notable whether we regard it as an accession of standard  value in our language, or as an honorable monument of what English  scholarship can do.\" The London Quarterly Review says: \"Errors  the most inveterate, that have been handed down without misgiving  from generation to generation, have been for the first time  corrected by Mr. Grote; facts the most familiar have been presented  in new aspects and relations; things dimly seen, and only partially  apprehended previously, have now assumed their true proportions  and real significance; while numerous traits of Grecian character;  and new veins of Grecian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#1)"],[1,"Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed  Proofreading Team.

VENUS IN FURS    By    LEOPOLD VON SACHER-MASOCH      Translated from the German    By    FERNANDA SAVAGE          INTRODUCTION      Leopold von Sacher-Masoch was born in Lemberg, Austrian Galicia, on  January 27, 1836. He studied jurisprudence at Prague and Graz, and in  1857 became a teacher at the latter university. He published several  historical works, but soon gave up his academic career to devote  himself wholly to literature. For a number of years he edited the  international review, _Auf der Hohe_, at Leipzig, but later removed to  Paris, for he was always strongly Francophile. His last years he spent  at Lindheim in Hesse, Germany, where he died on March 9, 1895. In 1873  he married Aurora von Rumelin, who wrote a number of novels under the  pseudonym of Wanda von Dunajew, which it is interesting to note is the  name of the heroine of _Venus in Furs_. Her sensational memoirs which  have been the cause of considerable controversy were published in 1906.    During his career as writer an endless number of works poured from  Sacher-Masoch's pen. Many of these were works of ephemeral journalism,  and some of them unfortunately pure sensationalism, for economic  necessity forced him to turn his pen to unworthy ends.    There is, however, a residue among his works which has a distinct  literary and even greater psychological value. His principal literary  ambition was never completely fulfilled. It was a somewhat  programmatic plan to give a picture of contemporary life in all its  various aspects and interrelations under the general title of the  _Heritage of Cain_. This idea was probably derived from Balzac's  _Comedie Humaine_. The whole was to be divided into six subdivisions  with the general titles _Love, Property, Money, The State, War,_ and  _Death_. Each of these divisions in its turn consisted of six novels,  of which the last was intended to summarize the author's conclusions  and to present his solution for the problems set in the others.    This extensive plan remained unachieved, and only the first two parts,  _Love_ and _Property_, were completed. Of the other sections only  fragments remain. The present novel, _Venus in Furs_, forms the fifth  in the series, _Love_.    The best of Sacher-Masoch's work is characterized by a swift  narration and a graphic representation of character and scene and a  rich humor. The latter has made many of his shorter stories dealing  with his native Galicia little masterpieces of local color.    There is, however, another element in his work which has caused his  name to become as eponym for an entire series of phenomena at one end  of the psycho-sexual scale. This gives his productions a peculiar  psychological value, though it cannot be denied also a morbid tinge  that makes them often repellent. However, it is well to remember that  nature is neither good nor bad, neither altruistic nor egoistic, and  that it operates through the human psyche as well as through crystals  and plants and animals with the same inexorable laws.    Sacher-Masoch was the poet of the anomaly now generally known as  _masochism_. By this is meant the desire on the part of the individual  affected of desiring himself completely and unconditionally subject to  the will of a person of the opposite sex, and being treated by this  person as by a master, to be humiliated, abused, and tormented, even  to the verge of death. This motive is treated in all its innumerable  variations. As a creative artist Sacher-Masoch was, of course, on the  quest for the absolute, and sometimes, when impulses in the human  being assume an abnormal or exaggerated form, there is just for a  moment a flash that gives a glimpse of the thing in itself.    If any defense were needed for the publication of work like  Sacher-Masoch's it is well to remember that artists are the historians  of the human soul and one might recall the wise and tolerant Montaigne's  essay _On the Duty of Historians_ where he says, \"One may cover over  secret actions, but to be silent on what all the world knows, and things  which have had effects which are public and of so much consequence is an  inexcusable defect.\"    And the curious interrelation between cruelty and sex, again and  again, creeps into literature. Sacher-Masoch has not created anything  new in this. He has simply taken an ancient motive and developed it  frankly and consciously, until, it seems, there is nothing further to  say on the subject. To the violent attacks which his books met he  replied in a polemical work, _Ueber den Wert der Kritik_.    It would be interesting to trace the masochistic tendency as it occurs  throughout literature, but no more can be done than just to allude to  a few instances. The theme recurs continually in the _Confessions_ of  Jean Jacques Rousseau; it explains the character of the chevalier in  Prevost's _Manon l'Escault_. Scenes of this nature are found in Zola's  _Nana_, in Thomas Otway's _Venice Preserved_, in Albert Juhelle's _Les  Pecheurs d'Hommes_, in Dostojevski. In disguised and unrecognized form  it constitutes the undercurrent of much of the sentimental literature  of the present day, though in most cases the authors as well as the  readers are unaware of the pathological elements out of which their  characters are built.    In all these strange and troubled waters of the human spirit one might  wish for something of the serene and simple attitude of the ancient  world. Laurent Tailhade has an admirable passage in his _Platres et  Marbres_, which is well worth reproducing in this connection:    \"Toutefois, les Hellenes, dans, leurs cites de lumiere, de douceur  et d'harmonie, avaient une indulgence qu'on peut nommer scientifique  pour les troubles amoureux de l'esprit. S'ils ne regardaient pas  l'aliene comme en proie a la visitation d'un dieu (idee orientale et  fataliste), du moins ils savaient que l'amour est une sorte  d'envoutement, une folie ou se manifeste l'animosite des puissances  cosmiques. Plus tard, le christianisme enveloppa les ames de  tenebres. Ce fut la grande nuit. L'Eglise condamna tout ce qui lui  parut neuf ou menacant pour les dogmes implacable qui reduisaient le  monde en esclavage.\"    Among Sacher-Masoch's works, _Venus in Furs_ is one of the most  typical and outstanding. In spite of melodramatic elements and other  literary faults, it is unquestionably a sincere work, written without  any idea of titillating morbid fancies. One feels that in the hero  many subjective elements have been incorporated, which are a  disadvantage to the work from the point of view of literature, but on  the other hand raise the book beyond the sphere of art, pure and  simple, and make it one of those appalling human documents which  belong, part to science and part to psychology. It is the confession  of a deeply unhappy man who could not master his personal tragedy of  existence, and so sought to unburden his soul in writing down the  things he felt and experienced. The reader who will approach the book  from this angle and who will honestly put aside moral prejudices and  prepossessions will come away from the perusal of this book with a  deeper understanding of this poor miserable soul of ours and a light  will be cast into dark places that lie latent in all of us.    Sacher-Masoch's works have held an established position in European  letters for something like half a century, and the author himself was  made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French Government in  1883, on the occasion of his literary jubilee. When several years ago  cheap reprints were brought out on the Continent and attempts were  made by various guardians of morality--they exist in all countries  --to have them suppressed, the judicial decisions were invariably  against the plaintiff and in favor of the publisher. Are Americans  children that they must be protected from books which any European  school-boy can purchase whenever he wishes? However, such seems to be  the case, and this translation, which has long been in preparation,  consequently appears in a limited edition printed for subscribers  only. In another connection Herbert Spencer once used these words:  \"The ultimate result of shielding men from the effects of folly, is to  fill the world with fools.\" They have a very pointed application in  the case of a work like _Venus in Furs_.    F. S.    Atlantic City  April, 1921          VENUS IN FURS            _\"But the Almighty Lord hath struck him,    and hath delivered him into the hands of    a woman.\"_    --The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.      My company was charming.    Opposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was  not a casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages  war against the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real,  true goddess of love.    She sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose  reflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes,  and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.    Her head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all  I could see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge  fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.    \"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any  longer. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You  must be nervous.\"    \"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice,  and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I  really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to  understand--\"    \"What, dear lady?\"    \"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the  un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand "]]]
