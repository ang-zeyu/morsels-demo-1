Accurate and  regular argument, indeed, such as is now expected of philosophical  inquirers, naturally throws a man into the methodical and didactic  manner; where he can immediately, without preparation, explain the point  at which he aims; and thence proceed, without interruption, to deduce  the proofs on which it is established. To deliver a SYSTEM in  conversation, scarcely appears natural; and while the dialogue-writer  desires, by departing from the direct style of composition, to give a  freer air to his performance, and avoid the appearance of Author and  Reader, he is apt to run into a worse inconvenience, and convey the  image of Pedagogue and Pupil. Or, if he carries on the dispute in the  natural spirit of good company, by throwing in a variety of topics, and  preserving a proper balance among the speakers, he often loses so much  time in preparations and transitions, that the reader will scarcely  think himself compensated, by all the graces of dialogue, for the order,  brevity, and precision, which are sacrificed to them.    There are some subjects, however, to which dialogue-writing is peculiarly  adapted, and where it is still preferable to the direct and simple method  of composition.    Any point of doctrine, which is so obvious that it scarcely admits of  dispute, but at the same time so important that it cannot be too often  inculcated, seems to require some such method of handling it; where the  novelty of the manner may compensate the triteness of the subject; where  the vivacity of conversation may enforce the precept; and where the  variety of lights, presented by various personages and characters, may  appear neither tedious nor redundant.    Any question of philosophy, on the other hand, which is so OBSCURE and  UNCERTAIN, that human reason can reach no fixed determination with regard  to it; if it should be treated at all, seems to lead us naturally into  the style of dialogue and conversation. Reasonable men may be allowed to  differ, where no one can reasonably be positive. Opposite sentiments,  even without any decision, afford an agreeable amusement; and if the  subject be curious and interesting, the book carries us, in a manner,  into company; and unites the two greatest and purest pleasures of human  life, study and society.    Happily, these circumstances are all to be found in the subject of  NATURAL RELIGION. What truth so obvious, so certain, as the being of a  God, which the most ignorant ages have acknowledged, for which the most  refined geniuses have ambitiously striven to produce new proofs and  arguments? What truth so important as this, which is the ground of all  our hopes, the surest foundation of morality, the firmest support of  society, and the only principle which ought never to be a moment absent  from our thoughts and meditations? But, in treating of this obvious and  important truth, what obscure questions occur concerning the nature of  that Divine Being, his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?  These have been always subjected to the disputations of men; concerning  these human reason has not reached any certain determination. But these  are topics so interesting, that we cannot restrain our restless inquiry  with regard to them; though nothing but doubt, uncertainty, and  contradiction, have as yet been the result of our most accurate  researches.    This I had lately occasion to observe, while I passed, as usual, part of  the summer season with CLEANTHES, and was present at those conversations  of his with PHILO and DEMEA, of which I gave you lately some imperfect  account. Your curiosity, you then told me, was so excited, that I must,  of necessity, enter into a more exact detail of their reasonings, and  display those various systems which they advanced with regard to so  delicate a subject as that of natural religion. The remarkable contrast  in their characters still further raised your expectations; while you  opposed the accurate philosophical turn of CLEANTHES to the careless  scepticism of PHILO, or compared either of their dispositions with the  rigid inflexible orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth rendered me a mere auditor  of their disputes; and that curiosity, natural to the early season of  life, has so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole chain and connection  of their arguments, that, I hope, I shall not omit or confound any  considerable part of them in the recital.          PART 1      After I joined the company, whom I found sitting in CLEANTHES's library,  DEMEA paid CLEANTHES some compliments on the great care which he took of  my education, and on his unwearied perseverance and constancy in all his  friendships. The father of PAMPHILUS, said he, was your intimate friend:  The son is your pupil; and may indeed be regarded as your adopted son,  were we to judge by the pains which you bestow in conveying to him every  useful branch of literature and science. You are no more wanting, I am  persuaded, in prudence, than in industry. I shall, therefore, communicate  to you a maxim, which I have observed with regard to my own children,  that I may learn how far it agrees with your practice. The method I  follow in their education is founded on the saying of an ancient, \"That  students of philosophy ought first to learn logics, then ethics, next  physics, last of all the nature of the gods.\" [Chrysippus apud Plut: de  repug: Stoicorum] This science of natural theology, according to him,  being the most profound and abstruse of any, required the maturest  judgement in its students; and none but a mind enriched with all the other  sciences, can safely be entrusted with it.    Are you so late, says PHILO, in teaching your children the principles of  religion? Is there no danger of their neglecting, or rejecting altogether  those opinions of which they have heard so little during the whole course  of their education? It is only as a science, replied DEMEA, subjected to  human reasoning and disputation, that I postpone the study of Natural  Theology. To season their minds with early piety, is my chief care; and  by continual precept and instruction, and I hope too by example, I  imprint deeply on their tender minds an habitual reverence for all the  principles of religion. While they pass through every other science, I  still remark the uncertainty of each part; the eternal disputations of  men; the obscurity of all philosophy; and the strange, ridiculous  conclusions, which some of the greatest geniuses have derived from the  principles of mere human reason. Having thus tamed their mind to a proper  submission and self-diffidence, I have no longer any scruple of opening  to them the greatest mysteries of religion; nor apprehend any danger from  that assuming arrogance of philosophy, which may lead them to reject the  most established doctrines and opinions.    Your precaution, says PHILO, of seasoning your children's minds early  with piety, is certainly very reasonable; and no more than is requisite  in this profane and irreligious age. But what I chiefly admire in your  plan of education, is your method of drawing advantage from the very  principles of philosophy and learning, which, by inspiring pride and  self-sufficiency, have commonly, in all ages, been found so destructive  to the principles of religion. The vulgar, indeed, we may remark, who are  unacquainted with science and profound inquiry, observing the endless  disputes of the learned, have commonly a thorough contempt for  philosophy; and rivet themselves the faster, by that means, in the great  points of theology which have been taught them. Those who enter a little  into study and inquiry, finding many appearances of evidence in  doctrines the newest and most extraordinary, think nothing too difficult  for human reason; and, presumptuously breaking through all fences,  profane the inmost sanctuaries of the temple. But CLEANTHES will, I hope,  agree with me, that, after we have abandoned ignorance, the surest  remedy, there is still one expedient left to prevent this profane  liberty. Let DEMEA's principles be improved and cultivated: Let us become  thoroughly sensible of the weakness, blindness, and narrow limits of  human reason: Let us duly consider its uncertainty and endless  contrarieties, even in subjects of common life and practice: Let the  errors and deceits of our very senses be set before us; the insuperable  difficulties which attend first principles in all systems; the  contradictions which adhere to the very ideas of matter, cause and  effect, extension, space, time, motion; and in a word, quantity of all  kinds, the object of the only science that can fairly pretend to any  certainty or evidence. When these topics are displayed in their full  light, as they are by some philosophers and almost all divines; who can  retain such confidence in this frail faculty of reason as to pay any  regard to its determinations in points so sublime, so abstruse, so remote  from common life and experience? When the coherence of the parts of a  stone, or even that composition of parts which renders it extended; when  these familiar objects, I say, are so inexplicable, and contain  circumstances so repugnant and contradictory; with what assurance can we  decide concerning the origin of worlds, or trace their history from  eternity to eternity?    While PHILO pronounced these words, I could observe a smile in the  countenance both of DEMEA and CLEANTHES. That of DEMEA seemed to imply an  unreserved satisfaction in the doctrines delivered: But, in CLEANTHES's  features, I could distinguish an air of finesse; as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#1)"],[1,"http://mormontextsproject.org/ for a complete list of  Mormon texts available on Project Gutenberg, to help  proofread similar books, or to report typos.

SUMMARY AND FINAL APPEAL    FAREWELL ADDRESS    NIGHT OF MARTYRDOM    DEATH OF THE AUTHOR'S WIFE    LINES, ON READING THE AUTHOR'S FIRST LETTER IN THE SERIES, BY MISS E.  R. SNOW        PREFACE.    The Author has, for some time, felt desirous to see the most prominent  subjects of the faith of Latter-day Saints brought before the public in  continuous order, in one volume.    This series of Letters was called forth by the letter of inquiry  prefixed, from the pen of the Rev. William Crowel. This gentleman was  at the time, and still is (for ought I know) Editor of \"_The Christian  Watchman_,\" Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.--a leading paper of the  Baptist denomination in the United States.    The Editor was also a clergyman of high repute for learning and piety  in that denomination of people, and missionary elect to a foreign  land. From the elevated standing of this gentleman, and the nature of  his inquiries being such as have come from many other distinguished  acquaintance, relative to the author's change of views, it seemed  wisdom, after consultation with the Prophet and Patriarch (since  martyred), to publish a brief reply to his minute and interesting  inquiries.    The author was extensively known in the New England and Middle States,  as a Preacher of the Baptist denomination. Reference for his character  is given to his Excellency George N. Briggs, Governor of the State of  Massachusetts, by whom he was once invited to take the pastoral charge  of the church where his Excellency resided, and of which he was a  member; also to G. Read, Esq., Connecticut, and Eliphalet Nott, D.D.,  L.L.D., President of Union College, New York, under whose Presidency he  graduated in 1824; and also to N. Kendrick D.D., President of Hamilton  Literary and Theological College, from whence the author graduated in  1829. The records of both these institutions will show that the author  held the FIRST grade of honourable distinction at the time he left them.    These references are not given from vanity, but from the fact that  almost every man's character is traduced and villified, the moment he  embraces the _faith_ once delivered to the Saints.    The present volume constitutes the third re-print, several thousand  copies having been exhausted in a tract form, the present edition, in  book form, was repeatedly inquired after.    The edition has been got out in the midst of multiplied engagements.  Truth in studied brevity has been aimed at, without seeking the least  embellishment of diction.    If there has, in part of the volume, been the appearance of severity  towards the religions of modern Christianity, it has been prompted  solely by the impulse of truth, in order to demolish error, before the  Destroyer of the Gentiles should expose iniquity with irretrievable  loss to its victims.    Scripture references have been studiously omitted, believing that  honest minds would readily find ample support from the scriptures  for all that is contained in this little volume. It is, therefore,  commended to the faith and cordial reception of all who desire the  salvation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in sincerity and truth.    ORSON SPENCER.    _Liverpool, January_ 1, 1848.        LETTER FROM THE REV. WILLIAM CROWELL, A. M. TO ORSON SPENCER, A. B.    _Boston, October_ 21, 1842.    MY DEAR SIR,--On the confidence of an old acquaintance and kindly  intercourse, I have long wished to address a friendly line to you;  for, I am sure, you have not forgotten the pleasant, though brief,  interviews which we enjoyed at Middlefield. Since I saw you there,  a great change has taken place, as I have been led to believe, in  your religious views, and a corresponding one in your relations and  circumstances; still, I trust, that you have not forgotten the claims  of friendship and acquaintance.    I need not tell you how much I became interested in your family--so  young and so full of promise--nor of the strong confidence which I  reposed in your piety and conscientious regard for the will of God. I  would not allow myself to believe that you would profess what you did  not sincerely believe, nor that you would believe without good reasons;  still the change in your views excited in me no little surprise. I  have, therefore, been desirous to receive from yourself an account  of your views, and the reasons of your change. I am also desirous to  obtain from one in whom I can confide--one who is acquainted with  the facts--and one who is not prejudiced against it at the outset,  some account of the faith which you have embraced; of the personal  character, doctrines, claims, and influence of him who is called the  leader--I mean Joseph Smith.    Does he claim to be inspired? Is he a man of prayer? a man of pure  life? a man of peace? Where is he now? Does he appear at the head of  his troops as a military commander? What is the nature of the worship  among you, and wherein does it differ from that of religious people  with whom you have been acquainted elsewhere?    How many inhabitants has the city of Nauvoo? What is their condition,  occupations, and general character? What are the dimensions of  the Temple, now in course of erection? Do the Mormons suffer much  persecution? if so, from whom? Are the children instructed in learning  and religion? It would give me great pleasure to learn, also, how you  are employed? whether your family are with you? and also your present  views of truth and duty, and in what respects they differ from the  views which you formerly entertained.    Excuse the number and minuteness of these inquiries. I take an interest  in all that affects the welfare of my fellow-men, and especially in  what is so important as their religious views and hopes. I am aware  that the people, and the views which you have adopted as your own,  are peculiarly liable to misrepresentation; but from you I may expect  something more impartial. Now, if you do not find the task too great  a tax upon your time, I should be much gratified in receiving as full  and as speedy an answer to the queries above proposed, with any other  information in your possession, as may be convenient to yourself.    It may be gratifying to you, to learn that a powerful revival of  religion has been enjoyed in Middlefield, within a few weeks past,--an  account of which, Mr. Bestor, the present pastor, has sent to me for  publication in _The Christian Watchman,_ a copy of which I send you. I  visited the town in the summer, and found your old friends well. I also  attended a minister's meeting at Brother Bestor's, and enjoyed a very  pleasant interview. Several of the brethren spoke of you in terms of  kindness.    My best wishes attend you. Present my regards to Mrs. Spencer, and    Believe me,    Very truly yours,    WILLIAM CROWELL.    P. S.--You will understand that I ask for information for my private  benefit and satisfaction. I do not ask for anything to be published,  unless you see fit to give it for that purpose. I wish you to write as  an old friend.    W. C.        LETTERS IN REPLY BY ORSON SPENCER, A. B.        LETTER I.    GENERAL INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.    _Nauvoo November_ 17, 1842.    My Dear Sir,--I received yours of the 21st ult. about a week since, but  many engagements have prevented a more early reply.    Your inquiries were interesting and important, and I only regret that  I have not more time and room to answer them as their importance and  minuteness demand.    I am not at all surprised that my old friends should wonder at my  change of views; even to this day it is marvellous in my own eyes,  how I should be separated from my brethren to this (Mormon) faith. I  greatly desire to see my Baptist brethren face to face, that I may tell  them all things pertaining to my views and this work; but, at present,  the care of my wife and six children, with the labours of a civil  office, forbids this privilege.    A sheet of paper is a poor conductor of a marvellous and controverted  system of theology; but receive this sheet as containing only some  broken hints upon which I hope to amplify in some better manner  hereafter. You have expressed confidence in my former conscientious  regard for the will of God. I thank you for this, because the virtues  of many good men have been disallowed upon some supposed forfeiture of  public esteem. I thank God that you, and many of the churches where I  once laboured, are more liberal.    You, more than common men, know that it is in accordance with all past  history, that men's true characters suffer imprisonment, scourging,  and death, as soon as they become innovators"]]]
