old enough to have  developed a legendary era, for such an era grows backward as a nation  grows forward. No little of the charm of European travel is ascribed to  the glamour that history and fable have flung around old churches,  castles, and the favored haunts of tourists, and the Rhine and Hudson are  frequently compared, to the prejudice of the latter, not because its  scenery lacks in loveliness or grandeur, but that its beauty has not been  humanized by love of chivalry or faerie, as that of the older stream has  been. Yet the record of our country's progress is of deep import, and as  time goes on the figures seen against the morning twilight of our history  will rise to more commanding stature, and the mists of legend will invest  them with a softness or glory that shall make reverence for them  spontaneous and deep. Washington hurling the stone across the Potomac may  live as the Siegfried of some Western saga, and Franklin invoking the  lightnings may be the Loki of our mythology. The bibliography of American  legends is slight, and these tales have been gathered from sources the  most diverse: records, histories, newspapers, magazines, oral  narrative--in every case reconstructed. The pursuit of them has been so  long that a claim may be set forth for some measure of completeness.    But, whatever the episodes of our four historic centuries may furnish to  the poet, painter, dramatist, or legend-building idealist of the future,  it is certain that we are not devoid of myth and folk-lore. Some  characters, prosaic enough, perhaps, in daily life, have impinged so  lightly on society before and after perpetrating their one or two great  deeds, that they have already become shadowy and their achievements have  acquired a color of the supernatural. It is where myth and history  combine that legend is most interesting and appeals to our fancy or our  sympathy most strongly; and it is not too early for us to begin the  collation of those quaint happenings and those spoken reports that gain  in picturesqueness with each transmission. An attempt has been made in  this instance to assemble only legends, for, doubtful as some historians  profess to find them, certain occurrences, like the story of Captain  Smith and Pocahontas, and the ride of General Putnam down Breakneck  Stairs, are taught as history; while as to folk-lore, that of the Indian  tribes and of the Southern negro is too copious to be recounted in this  work. It will be noted that traditions do not thrive in brick and  brownstone, and that the stories once rife in the colonial cities have  almost as effectually disappeared as the architectural landmarks of last  century. The field entered by the writer is not untrodden. Hawthorne and  Irving have made paths across it, and it is hoped that others may deem  its farther exploration worthy of their efforts.          THE HUDSON AND ITS HILLS          RIP VAN WINKLE    The story of Rip Van Winkle, told by Irving, dramatized by Boucicault,  acted by Jefferson, pictured by Darley, set to music by Bristow, is the  best known of American legends. Rip was a real personage, and the Van  Winkles are a considerable family at this day. An idle, good-natured,  happy-go-lucky fellow, he lived, presumably, in the village of Catskill,  and began his long sleep in 1769. His wife was a shrew, and to escape her  abuse Rip often took his dog and gun and roamed away to the Catskills,  nine miles westward, where he lounged or hunted, as the humor seized him.

[Illustration: GUY EARL OF WARWICK]    LEGENDS THAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW    A SELECTION OF THE GREAT LEGENDS OF ALL TIMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE    EDITED BY HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE    ILLUSTRATED AND DECORATED BY BLANCHE OSTERTAG          INTRODUCTION      If we knew how the words in our language were made and what they have  meant to successive generations of the men and women who have used them,  we should have a new and very interesting kind of history to read. For  words, like all other creations of man, were not deliberately  manufactured to meet a need, as are the various parts of a bicycle or of  an automobile; but grew gradually and slowly out of experiences which  compelled their production. For it is one of the evidences of the  brotherhood of men that, either by the pressure of necessity or of the  instinct to describe to others what has happened to ourself and so make  common property of personal experience, no interesting or influential or  significant thing can befall a man that is not accompanied by a desire  to communicate it to others.    The word legend has a very interesting history, which sheds light not  only on its origin but on early habits of thought and customs. It is  derived from the Latin verb _legere_, which means \"to read.\" As  legends are often passed down by word of mouth and are not reduced to  writing until they have been known for centuries by great numbers of  people, it seems difficult at first glance to see any connection between  the Latin word and its English descendant. In Russia and other  countries, where large populations live remote from cities and are  practically without books and newspapers, countless stories are told by  peasant mothers to their children, by reciters or semi-professional  story-tellers, which have since been put into print. For a good many  hundred years, probably, the vast majority of legends were not read;  they were heard.    When we understand, however, what the habits of people were in the early  Christian centuries and what the early legends were about, the original  meaning of the word is not only clear but throws light on the history of  this fascinating form of literature. The early legends, as a rule, had  to do with religious people or with places which had religious  associations; they were largely concerned with the saints and were  freely used in churches for the instruction of the people. In all  churches selections from some book or books are used as part of the  service; readings from the Old and New Testament are included in the  worship of all churches in Christendom. In the earliest times not only  were Lessons from the Old Testament and the Gospels and Epistles of the  New Testament read, but letters of bishops and selections from other  writings which were regarded as profitable for religious instruction.  Later stories of the saints and passages from the numerous lives which  appeared were read at different services and contributed greatly to  their interest. The first legends in Christian countries were incidents  from the lives of the saints and were included in the selections made  from various writings for public worship; these selections were called  _legends_. The history of the word makes clear, therefore, the  origin and early history of the class of stories which we call legends.    The use of the stories at church services led to the collection, orderly  arrangement and reshaping of a great mass of material which grew rapidly  because so many people were interested in these semi-religious tales. In  the beginning the stories had, as a rule, some basis in fact, though it  was often very slight. As time went on the element of fact grew smaller  and the element of fiction larger; stories which were originally very  short were expanded into long tales and became highly imaginative. In  the Thirteenth Century the _Legenda Aurea_, or Golden Legend, which  became one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages, appeared. In  time, as the taste for this kind of writing grew, the word legend came  to include any story which, under a historical form, gave an account of  an historical or imaginary person.    During the Middle Ages verse-making was very popular and very widely  practised; for versification is very easy when people are in the habit  of using it freely, and a verse is much more easily remembered than a  line of prose. For many generations legends were versified. It must be  remembered that verse and poetry are often very far apart; and poetry is  as difficult to compose as verse is easy. The versified legends were  very rarely poetic; they were simply narratives in verse. Occasionally  men of poetic genius took hold of these old stories and gave them  beautiful forms as did the German poet Hartmann von Aue in \"Der Arme  Heinrich.\" With the tremendous agitation which found expression in the  Reformation, interest in legends died out, and was not renewed until the  Eighteenth Century, when men and women, grown weary of artificial and  mechanical forms of literature, turned again to the old stories and  songs which were the creation of less self-conscious ages. With the  revival of interest in ballads, folk-stories, fairy stories and myths  came a revival of interest in legends.    The myths were highly imaginative and poetic explanations of the world  and of the life of man in it at a time when scientific knowledge and  habits of thought had not come into existence. The fairy story was \"a  free poetic dealing with realities in accordance with the law of mental  growth, ... a poetic wording of the facts of life, ... an endeavour to  shape the facts of the world to meet the needs of the imagination, the  cravings of the heart.\" The legend, dealing originally with incidents in  the lives of the saints and with places made sacred by association with  holy men, has, as a rule, some slight historical basis; is cast in  narrative form and told as a record of fact; and, in cases where it is  entirely imaginative, deals with some popular type of character like  Robin Hood or Rip Van Winkle; or with some mysterious or tragic event,  as Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King\" are poetic renderings of part of a  great mass of legends which grew up about a little group of imaginary or  semi-historical characters; Longfellow's \"Golden Legend\" is a modern  rendering of a very old mediaeval tale; Irving's \"Legend of Sleepy  Hollow\" is an example of purely imaginative prose, and Heine's \"Lorelei\"  of a purely imaginative poetic legend.    The legend is not so sharply defined as the myth and the fairy story,  and it is not always possible to separate it from these old forms of  stories; but it always concerns itself with one or more characters; it  assumes to be historical; it is almost always old and haunts some  locality like a ghost; and it has a large admixture of fiction, even  where it is not wholly fictitious. Like the myth and fairy story it  throws light on the mind and character of the age that produced it; it  is part of the history of the unfolding of the human mind in the world;  and, above all, it is interesting.

Hiawatha is an example of the  intellectual capacity of one of that race of whom it has been said \"Take  these Indians in their owne trimme and naturall disposition, and they  bee reported to bee wise, lofty spirited, constant in friendship to one  another: true in their promise, and more industrious than many  others.\"--Wood's, \"New England's Prospect,\" London, 1634.]      On the banks of Tioto, or Cross Lake, resided an eminent man who bore  the name of Hiawatha, or the Wise Man.    This name was given him, as its meaning indicates, on account of his  great wisdom in council and power in war. Hiawatha was of high and  mysterious origin.
