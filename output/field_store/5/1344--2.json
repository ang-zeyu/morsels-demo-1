WHICH DEALS WITH ORIGINS    Faithfully to relate how Eliphalet Hopper came try St. Louis is to  betray no secret. Mr. Hopper is wont to tell the story now, when his  daughter-in-law is not by; and sometimes he tells it in her presence,  for he is a shameless and determined old party who denies the divine  right of Boston, and has taken again to chewing tobacco.    When Eliphalet came to town, his son's wife, Mrs. Samuel D. (or S.  Dwyer as she is beginning to call herself), was not born. Gentlemen  of Cavalier and Puritan descent had not yet begun to arrive at the  Planters' House, to buy hunting shirts and broad rims, belts and  bowies, and depart quietly for Kansas, there to indulge in that; most  pleasurable of Anglo-Saxon pastimes, a free fight. Mr. Douglas had not  thrown his bone of Local Sovereignty to the sleeping dogs of war.    To return to Eliphalet's arrival,--a picture which has much that is  interesting in it. Behold the friendless boy he stands in the prow of  the great steamboat 'Louisiana' of a scorching summer morning, and looks  with something of a nameless disquiet on the chocolate waters of the  Mississippi. There have been other sights, since passing Louisville,  which might have disgusted a Massachusetts lad more. A certain deck  on the 'Paducah', which took him as far as Cairo, was devoted to  cattle--black cattle. Eliphalet possessed a fortunate temperament. The  deck was dark, and the smell of the wretches confined there was worse  than it should have been. And the incessant weeping of some of the women  was annoying, inasmuch as it drowned many of the profane communications  of the overseer who was showing Eliphalet the sights. Then a  fine-linened planter from down river had come in during the  conversation, and paying no attention to the overseer's salute cursed  them all into silence, and left.    Eliphalet had ambition, which is not a wholly undesirable quality.  He began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable  fellow-creatures. He reached out and touched lightly a young mulatto  woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms. The peculiar dumb  expression on her face was lost on Eliphalet. The overseer had laughed  coarsely.    \"What, skeered on 'em?\" said he. And seizing the girl by the cheek, gave  it a cruel twinge that brought a cry out of her.    Eliphalet had reflected upon this incident after he had bid the overseer  good-by at Cairo, and had seen that pitiful coffle piled aboard a  steamer for New Orleans. And the result of his reflections was, that  some day he would like to own slaves.    A dome of smoke like a mushroom hung over the city, visible from  far down the river, motionless in the summer air. A long line of  steamboats--white, patient animals--was tethered along the levee, and  the Louisiana presently swung in her bow toward a gap in this line,  where a mass of people was awaiting her arrival. Some invisible force  lifted Eliphalet's eyes to the upper deck, where they rested, as if  by appointment, on the trim figure of the young man in command of the  Louisiana. He was very young for the captain of a large New Orleans  packet. When his lips moved, something happened. Once he raised his  voice, and a negro stevedore rushed frantically aft, as if he had  received the end of a lightning-bolt. Admiration burst from the  passengers, and one man cried out Captain Brent's age--it was  thirty-two.    Eliphalet snapped his teeth together. He was twenty-seven, and his  ambition actually hurt him at such times. After the boat was fast to the  landing stage he remained watching the captain, who was speaking a few  parting words to some passengers of fashion. The body-servants were  taking their luggage to the carriages. Mr. Hopper envied the captain his  free and vigorous speech, his ready jokes, and his hearty laugh. All the  rest he knew for his own--in times to come. The carriages, the trained  servants, the obsequiousness of the humbler passengers. For of such is  the Republic.    Then Eliphalet picked his way across the hot stones of the levee,  pushing hither and thither in the rough crowd of river men; dodging the  mules on the heavy drays, or making way for the carriages of the few  people of importance who arrived on the boat. If any recollections of  a cool, white farmhouse amongst barren New England hills disturbed his  thoughts, this is not recorded. He gained the mouth of a street between  the low houses which crowded on the broad river front. The black mud was  thick under his feet from an overnight shower, and already steaming in  the sun. The brick pavement was lumpy from much travel and near as dirty  as the street. Here, too, were drays blocking the way, and sweaty negro  teamsters swinging cowhides over the mules. The smell of many wares  poured through the open doors, mingling with the perspiration of the  porters. On every side of him were busy clerks, with their suspenders  much in evidence, and Eliphalet paused once or twice to listen to  their talk. It was tinged with that dialect he had heard, since leaving  Cincinnati.    Turning a corner, Eliphalet came abruptly upon a prophecy. A great drove  of mules was charging down the gorge of the street, and straight at him.  He dived into an entrance, and stood looking at the animals in startled  wonder as they thundered by, flinging the mud over the pavements. A  cursing lot of drovers on ragged horses made the rear guard.    Eliphalet mopped his brow. The mules seemed to have aroused in him some  sense of his atomity, where the sight of the pillar of smoke and of the  black cattle had failed. The feeling of a stranger in a strange land  was upon him at last. A strange land, indeed! Could it be one with his  native New England? Did Congress assemble from the Antipodes? Wasn't the  great, ugly river and dirty city at the end of the earth, to be written  about in Boston journals?    Turning in the doorway, he saw to his astonishment a great store, with  high ceilings supported by columns. The door was stacked high with  bales of dry goods. Beside him was a sign in gold lettering, \"Carvel and  Company, Wholesale Dry Goods.\" And lastly, looking down upon him with  a quizzical expression, was a gentleman. There was no mistaking the  gentleman. He was cool, which Eliphalet was not. And the fact is the  more remarkable because the gentleman was attired according to the  fashion of the day for men of his age, in a black coat with a teal of  ruffled shirt showing, and a heavy black stock around his collar. He had  a white mustache, and a goatee, and white hair under his black felt hat.  His face was long, his nose straight, and the sweetness of its smile had  a strange effect upon Eliphalet, who stood on one foot.    \"Well, sonny, scared of mules, are you?\" The speech is a stately drawl  very different from the nasal twang of Eliphalet's bringing up. \"Reckon  you don't come from anywhere round here?\"    \"No, sir,\" said Eliphalet. \"From Willesden, Massachusetts.\"    \"Come in on the 'Louisiana'?\"    \"Yes, sir.\" But why this politeness?    The elderly gentleman lighted a cigar. The noise of the rushing mules  had now become a distant roar, like a whirlwind which has swept by. But  Eliphalet did not stir.    \"Friends in town?\" inquired the gentleman at length.    \"No, sir,\" sighed Mr. Hopper.    At this point of the conversation a crisp step sounded from behind and  wonderful smile came again on the surface.    \"Mornin', Colonel,\" said a voice which made Eliphalet jump. And he swung  around to perceive the young captain of the Louisiana.    \"Why, Captain Lige,\" cried the Colonel, without ceremony, \"and how do  you find yourself to-day, suh? A good trip from Orleans? We did not look  for you so soon.\"    \"Tolluble, Colonel, tolluble,\" said the young man, grasping the  Colonel's hand. \"Well, Colonel, I just called to say that I got the  seventy bales of goods you wanted.\"    \"Ephum\" cried the Colonel, diving toward a counter where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#1)"],[1,"Marvelous                                  Land of Oz                             Being an account of the                          further adventures of the                                    Scarecrow                               and Tin Woodman                             and also the strange                         experiences of the highly                   magnified Woggle-Bug, Jack Pumpkinhead,                            the Animated Saw-Horse                                and the Gump;                               the story being                          A Sequel to The Wizard of Oz                                       By                                 L.

At first I considered these little letters, frank and earnest though they  were, in the light of pretty compliments; but the letters continued to come  during succeeding months, and even years.    Finally I promised one little girl, who made a long journey to see me and  prefer her request,--and she is a \"Dorothy,\" by the way--that when a  thousand little girls had written me a thousand little letters asking for  the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman I would write the book, Either little  Dorothy was a fairy in disguise, and waved her magic wand, or the success of  the stage production of \"The Wizard of OZ\" made new friends for the story,  For the thousand letters reached their destination long since--and many  more followed them.    And now, although pleading guilty to long delay, I have kept my promise in  this book.    L. FRANK BAUM.

There was more to his name than that, for old  Mombi often declared that his whole name was Tippetarius; but no one was  expected to say such a long word when \"Tip\" would do just as well.    This boy remembered nothing of his parents, for he had been brought when  quite young to be reared by the old woman known as Mombi, whose reputation,  I am sorry to say, was none of the best. For the Gillikin people had reason  to suspect her of indulging in magical arts, and therefore hesitated to  associate with her.    Mombi was not exactly a Witch, because the Good Witch who ruled that part of  the Land of Oz        8                    Line-Art Drawing    had forbidden any other Witch to exist in her dominions. So Tip's guardian,  however much she might aspire to working magic, realized it was unlawful to  be more than a Sorceress, or at most a Wizardess.    Tip was made to carry wood from the forest, that the old woman might boil  her pot. He also worked in the corn-fields, hoeing and husking; and he fed  the pigs and milked the four-horned cow that was Mombi's especial pride.    But you must not suppose he worked all the time, for he felt that would be  bad for him. When sent to the forest Tip often climbed trees for birds' eggs  or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks  with bent pins. Then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it  home. And when he was supposed to be working in the corn-fields, and the  tall stalks hid him from Mombi's view, Tip would often dig in the gopher  holes, or if the mood seized him--        9  lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap. So, by taking  care not to exhaust his strength, he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may  be.    Mombi's curious magic often frightened her neighbors, and they treated her  shyly, yet respectfully, because of her weird powers. But Tip frankly hated  her, and took no pains to hide his feelings. Indeed, he sometimes showed  less respect for the old woman than he should have done, considering she was  his guardian.    There were pumpkins in Mombi's corn-fields, lying golden red among the rows  of green stalks; and these had been planted and carefully tended that the  four-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time. But one day, after the  corn had all been cut and stacked, and Tip was carrying the pumpkins to the  stable, he took a notion to make a \"Jack Lantern\" and try to give the old  woman a fright with it.    So he selected a fine, big pumpkin--one with a lustrous, orange-red color--and  began carving it. With the point of his knife he made two round eyes,  a three-cornered nose, and                   Line-Art Drawing        10  a mouth shaped like a new moon. The face, when completed, could not have  been considered strictly beautiful; but it wore a smile so big and broad,  and was so jolly in expression, that even Tip laughed as he looked  admiringly at his work.    The child had no playmates, so he did not know that boys often dig out the  inside of a \"pumpkin-jack,\" and in the space thus made put a lighted candle  to render the face more startling; but he conceived an idea of his own that  promised to be quite as effective. He decided to manufacture the form of a  man, who would wear this pumpkin head, and to stand it in a place where old  Mombi would meet it face to face.    \"And then,\" said Tip to himself, with a laugh, \"she'll squeal louder than  the brown pig does when I pull her tail, and shiver with fright worse than I  did last year when I had the ague!\"    He had plenty of time to accomplish this task, for Mombi had gone to a  village--to buy groceries, she said--and it was a journey of at least  two days.    So he took his axe to the forest, and selected some stout, straight  saplings, which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves. From  these he would make the arms, and legs, and feet of his man. For the body he  stripped a sheet of thick        11  bark from around a big tree, and with much labor fashioned it into a  cylinder of about the right size, pinning the edges together with wooden  pegs. Then, whistling happily as he worked, he carefully jointed the limbs  and fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife.    By the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark, and Tip  remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs. So he picked up his  wooden man and carried it back to the house with him.    During the evening, by the light of the fire in the kitchen, Tip carefully  rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat  and workmanlike manner. Then he stood the figure up against the wall and  admired it. It seemed remarkably tall, even for a full-grown man; but that  was a good point in a small boy's eyes, and Tip did not object at all to the  size of his "]]]
