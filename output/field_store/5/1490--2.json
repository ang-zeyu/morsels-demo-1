Henley_.    His name was Charlie Mears; he was the only son of his mother who was a  widow, and he lived in the north of London, coming into the City every day  to work in a bank. He was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations.  I met him in a public billiard-saloon where the marker called him by his  given name, and he called the marker \"Bullseyes.\" Charlie explained, a  little nervously, that he had only come to the place to look on, and since  looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young, I  suggested that Charlie should go back to his mother.    That was our first step toward better acquaintance. He would call on me  sometimes in the evenings instead of running about London with his  fellow-clerks; and before long, speaking of himself as a young man must,  he told me of his aspirations, which were all literary. He desired to make  himself an undying name chiefly through verse, though he was not above  sending stories of love and death to the drop-a-penny-in-the-slot  journals. It was my fate to sit still while Charlie read me poems of many  hundred lines, and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the  world. My reward was his unreserved confidence, and the self-revelations  and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden.  Charlie had never fallen in love, but was anxious to do so on the first  opportunity; he believed in all things good and all things honorable, but,  at the same time, was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way  about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twenty-five shillings a week.  He rhymed \"dove\" with \"love\" and \"moon\" with \"June,\" and devoutly believed  that they had never so been rhymed before. The long lame gaps in his plays  he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on,  seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already  done, and turned to me for applause.    I fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations, and I know that  his writing-table at home was the edge of his washstand. This he told me  almost at the outset of our acquaintance; when he was ravaging my  bookshelves, and a little before I was implored to speak the truth as to  his chances of \"writing something really great, you know.\" Maybe I  encouraged him too much, for, one night, he called on me, his eyes flaming  with excitement, and said breathlessly:    \"Do you mind--can you let me stay here and write all this evening? I won't  interrupt you, I won't really. There's no place for me to write in at my  mother's.\"    \"What's the trouble?\" I said, knowing well what that trouble was.    \"I've a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that was  ever written. Do let me write it out here. It's _such_ a notion!\"    There was no resisting the appeal. I set him a table; he hardly thanked  me, but plunged into the work at once. For half an hour the pen scratched  without stopping. Then Charlie sighed and tugged his hair. The scratching  grew slower, there were more erasures, and at last ceased. The finest  story in the world would not come forth.    \"It looks such awful rot now,\" he said, mournfully. \"And yet it seemed so  good when I was thinking about it. What's wrong?\"    I could not dishearten him by saying the truth. So I answered: \"Perhaps  you don't feel in the mood for writing.\"    \"Yes I do--except when I look at this stuff. Ugh!\"    \"Read me what you've done,\" I said.    He read, and it was wondrous bad, and he paused at all the specially  turgid sentences, expecting a little approval; for he was proud of those  sentences, as I knew he would be.    \"It needs compression,\" I suggested, cautiously.    \"I hate cutting my things down. I don't think you could alter a word here  without spoiling the sense. It reads better aloud than when I was writing  it.\"    \"Charlie, you're suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a numerous  class. Put the thing by, and tackle it again in a week.\"    \"I want to do it at once. What do you think of it?\"    \"How can I judge from a half-written tale? Tell me the story as it lies in  your head.\"    Charlie told, and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance  had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word. I looked  at him, and wondering whether it were possible that he did not know the  originality, the power of the notion that had come in his way? It was  distinctly a Notion among notions. Men had been puffed up with pride by  notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable. But Charlie babbled on  serenely, interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of horrible  sentences that he purposed to use. I heard him out to the end. It would be  folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands, when I could do  so much with it. Not all that could be done indeed; but, oh so much!    \"What do you think?\" he said, at last. \"I fancy I shall call it 'The Story  of a Ship.'\"    \"I think the idea's pretty good; but you won't be able to handle it for  ever so long. Now I\"----    \"Would it be of any use to you? Would you care to take it? I should be  proud,\" said Charlie, promptly.    There are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless, hot-headed,  intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even a woman in her blindest  devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores, tilt her  bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech  with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still it was  necessary to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of Charlie's  thoughts.    \"Let's make a bargain. I'll give you a fiver for the notion,\" I said.    Charlie became a bank-clerk at once.    \"Oh, that's impossible. Between two pals, you know, if I may call you so,  and speaking as a man of the world, I couldn't. Take the notion if it's  any use to you. I've heaps more.\"    He had--none knew this better than I--but they were the notions of other  men.    \"Look at it as a matter of business--between men of the world,\" I  returned. \"Five pounds will buy you any number of poetry-books. Business  is business, and you may be sure I shouldn't give that price unless\"----    \"Oh, if you put it _that_ way,\" said Charlie, visibly moved by the thought  of the books. The bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at  unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed,  should have a table of his own to write at, and unquestioned right to  inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems. Then I said, \"Now  tell me how you came by this idea.\"    \"It came by itself,\" Charlie's eyes opened a little.    \"Yes, but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read  before somewhere.\"    \"I haven't any time for reading, except when you let me sit here, and on  Sundays I'm on my bicycle or down the river all day. There's nothing wrong  about the hero, is there?\"    \"Tell me again and I shall understand clearly. You say that your hero went  pirating. How did he live?\"    \"He was on the lower deck of this ship-thing that I was telling you  about.\"    \"What sort of ship?\"    \"It was the kind rowed with oars, and the sea spurts through the oar-holes  and the men row sitting up to their knees in water. Then there's a bench  running down between the two lines of oars and an overseer with a whip  walks up and down the bench to make the men work.\"    \"How do you know that?\"    \"It's in the tale. There's a rope running overhead, looped to the upper  deck, for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls. When the  overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers, remember the  hero laughs at him and gets licked for it. He's chained to his oar of  course--the hero.\"    \"How is he chained?\"    \"With an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on, and a  sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar. He's on the  lower deck where the worst men are sent, and the only light comes from the  hatchways and through the oar-holes. Can't you imagine the sunlight just  squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling about as  the ship moves?\"    \"I can, but I can't imagine your imagining it.\"    \"How could it be any other way? Now you listen to me. The long oars on the  upper deck are managed by four men to each bench, the lower ones by three,  and the lowest of all by two. Remember, it's quite dark on the lowest deck  and all the men there go mad. When a man dies at his oar on that deck he  isn't thrown overboard, but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the  oar-hole in little pieces.\"    \"Why?\" I demanded, amazed, not so much at the information as the tone of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8659"],[0,"Sabbath in Puritan New England (#1)"],[1,"Editor's Note: In addition to various other variations of grammar and  spelling from that old time, the word \"their\" is spelled as \"thier\" 17 times.

The New England Meeting-House.        When the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth they at once assigned a Lord's  Day meeting-place for the Separatist church,--\"a timber fort both strong  and comely, with flat roof and battlements;\" and to this fort, every  Sunday, the men and women walked reverently, three in a row, and in it they  worshipped until they built for themselves a meeting-house in 1648.    As soon as each successive outlying settlement was located and established,  the new community built a house for the purpose of assembling therein for  the public worship of God; this house was called a meeting-house. Cotton  Mather said distinctly that he \"found no just ground in Scripture to apply  such a trope as church to a house for public assembly.\" The church, in the  Puritan's way of thinking, worshipped in the meeting-house, and he was as  bitterly opposed to calling this edifice a church as he was to calling the  Sabbath Sunday. His favorite term for that day was the Lord's Day.    The settlers were eager and glad to build their meeting-houses; for these  houses of God were to them the visible sign of the establishment of that  theocracy which they had left their fair homes and had come to New England  to create and perpetuate. But lest some future settlements should be slow  or indifferent about doing their duty promptly, it was enacted in 1675 that  a meeting-house should be erected in every town in the colony; and if the  people failed to do so at once, the magistrates were empowered to build it,  and to charge the cost of its erection to the town. The number of members  necessary to establish a separate church was very distinctly given in the  Platform of Church Discipline: \"A church ought not to be of greater number  than can ordinarilie meet convenientlie in one place, nor ordinarilie  fewer than may convenientlie carry on church-work.\" Each church was quite  independent in its work and government, and had absolute power to admit,  expel, control, and censure its members.    These first meeting-houses were simple buildings enough,--square log-houses  with clay-filled chinks, surmounted by steep roofs thatched with long  straw or grass, and often with only the beaten earth for a floor. It was  considered a great advance and a matter of proper pride when the settlers  had the meeting-house \"lathed on the inside, and so daubed and whitened  over workmanlike.\" The dimensions of many of these first essays at church  architecture are known to us, and lowly little structures they were. One,  indeed, is preserved for us under cover at Salem. The first meeting-house  in Dedham was thirty-six feet long, twenty feet wide, and twelve feet high  \"in the stud;\" the one in Medford was smaller still; and the Haverhill  edifice was only twenty-six feet long and twenty wide, yet \"none other than  the house of God.\"    As the colonists grew in wealth and numbers, they desired and built better  sanctuaries, \"good roomthy meeting-houses\" they were called by Judge  Sewall, the most valued and most interesting journal-keeper of the times.  The rude early buildings were then converted into granaries or storehouses,  or, as was the Pentucket meeting-house, into a \"house of shelter or a house  to sett horses in.\" As these meeting-houses had not been consecrated, and  as they were town-halls, forts, or court-houses as well as meeting-houses,  the humbler uses to which they were finally put were not regarded as  profanations of holy places.    The second form or type of American church architecture was a square wooden  building, usually unpainted, crowned with a truncated pyramidal roof, which  was surmounted (if the church could afford such luxury) with a belfry or  turret containing a bell. The old church at Hingham, the \"Old Ship\" which  was built in 1681, is still standing, a well-preserved example of this  second style of architecture. These square meeting-houses, so much alike,  soon abounded in New England; for a new church, in its contract for  building, would often specify that the structure should be \"like in every  detaile to the Lynn meeting-house,\" or like the Hadley, Milford, Boston,  Danvers, or New Haven meeting-house. This form of edifice was the prototype  of the fine great First Church of Boston, a large square brick building,  with three rows of windows and two galleries, which stood from the year  1713 to 1808, and of which many pictures exist.    The third form of the Puritan meeting-house, of which the Old South Church  of Boston is a typical model, has too many representatives throughout New  England to need any description, as have also the succeeding forms of New  England church architecture.    The first meeting-houses were often built in the valleys, in the meadow  lands; for the dwelling-houses must be clustered around them, since the  colonists were ordered by law to build their new homes within half a mile  of the meeting-house. Soon, however, the houses became too closely crowded  for the most convenient uses of a farming community; pasturage for the  cattle had to be obtained at too great a distance from the farmhouse;  firewood had to be brought from too distant woods; nearness to water  also had to be considered. Thus the law became a dead letter, and each  new-coming settler built on outlying and remote land, since the Indians  were no longer so deeply to be dreaded. Then the meeting-houses, having  usually to accommodate a whole township of scattered farms, were placed on  remote and often highly elevated locations; sometimes at the very top of a  long, steep hill,--so long and so steep in some cases, especially in one  Connecticut parish, that church attendants could not ride down on horseback  from the pinnacled meeting-house, but were forced to scramble down, leading  their horses, and mount from a horse-block at the foot of the hill. The  second Roxbury church was set on a high hill, and the story is fairly  pathetic of the aged and feeble John Eliot, the glory of New England  Puritanism, that once, as he toiled patiently up the long ascent to his  dearly loved meeting, he said to the person on whose supporting arm he  leaned (in the Puritan fashion of teaching a lesson from any event and  surrounding): \"This is very like the way to heaven; 'tis uphill. The Lord  by His grace fetch us up.\"    The location on a hilltop was chosen and favored for various reasons. The  meeting-house was at first a watch-house, from which to keep vigilant  lookout for any possible approach of hostile or sneaking Indians; it was  also a landmark, whose high bell-turret, or steeple, though pointing to  heaven, was likewise a guide on earth, for, thus stationed on a high  elevation, it could be seen for miles around by travellers journeying  through the woods, or in the narrow, tree-obscured bridle-paths which were  then almost the only roads. In seaside towns it could be a mark for for  sailors at sea; such was the Truro meeting-house. Then, too, our Puritan  ancestors dearly loved a \"sightly location,\" and were willing to climb  uphill cheerfully, even through bleak New England winters, for the sake of  having a meeting-house which showed off well, and was a proper source of  envy to the neighboring villages and the country around. The studiously  remote and painfully inaccessible locations chosen for the site of many  fine, roomy churches must astonish any observing traveller on the byroads  of New England. Too often, alas! these churches are deserted, falling down,  unopened from year to year, destitute alike of minister and congregation.  Sometimes, too, on high hilltops, or on lonesome roads leading through a  tall second growth of woods, deserted and neglected old graveyards--the  most lonely and forlorn of all sad places--by their broken and fallen  headstones, which surround a half-filled-in and uncovered cellar, show  that once a meeting-house for New England Christians had stood there. Tall  grass, and a tangle of blackberry brambles cover the forgotten graves,  and perhaps a spire of orange tiger-lilies, a shrub of southernwood or of  winter-killed and dying box, may struggle feebly for life under the shadow  of the \"plumed ranks of tall wild cherry,\" and prove that once these lonely  graves were cared for and loved for the sake of those who lie buried in  this now waste spot. No traces remain of the old meeting-house save the  cellar and the narrow stone steps, sadly leading nowhere, which once were  pressed by the feet of the children of the Pilgrims, but now are trodden  only by the curious and infrequent passer-by, or the epitaph-seeking  antiquary.    It is difficult often to understand the details in the descriptions of  these early meeting-houses, the colonial"]]]
