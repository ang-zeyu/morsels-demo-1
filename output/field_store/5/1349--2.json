[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess â€” Complete (#1)"],[1,"EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Complete    By Georg Ebers      Translated from the German by Eleanor Grove          PREFACE TO THE SECOND GERMAN EDITION              Aut prodesse volunt ant delectare poetae,            Aut simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vitae.                 Horat. De arte poetica v. 333.    It is now four years since this book first appeared before the public,  and I feel it my duty not to let a second edition go forth into the  world without a few words of accompaniment. It hardly seems necessary to  assure my readers that I have endeavored to earn for the following pages  the title of a \"corrected edition.\" An author is the father of his book,  and what father could see his child preparing to set out on a new  and dangerous road, even if it were not for the first time, without  endeavoring to supply him with every good that it lay in his power to  bestow, and to free him from every fault or infirmity on which the world  could look unfavorably? The assurance therefore that I have repeatedly  bestowed the greatest possible care on the correction of my Egyptian  Princess seems to me superfluous, but at the same time I think it  advisable to mention briefly where and in what manner I have found  it necessary to make these emendations. The notes have been revised,  altered, and enriched with all those results of antiquarian research  (more especially in reference to the language and monuments of ancient  Egypt) which have come to our knowledge since the year 1864, and which  my limited space allowed me to lay before a general public. On the  alteration of the text itself I entered with caution, almost with  timidity; for during four years of constant effort as academical tutor,  investigator and writer in those severe regions of study which exclude  the free exercise of imagination, the poetical side of a man's nature  may forfeit much to the critical; and thus, by attempting to remodel my  tale entirely, I might have incurred the danger of removing it from the  more genial sphere of literary work to which it properly belongs. I have  therefore contented myself with a careful revision of the style, the  omission of lengthy passages which might have diminished the interest of  the story to general readers, the insertion of a few characteristic or  explanatory additions, and the alteration of the proper names. These  last I have written not in their Greek, but in their Latin forms, having  been assured by more than one fair reader that the names Ibykus and  Cyrus would have been greeted by them as old acquaintances, whereas the  \"Ibykos\" and \"Kyros\" of the first edition looked so strange and learned,  as to be quite discouraging. Where however the German k has the same  worth as the Roman c I have adopted it in preference. With respect  to the Egyptian names and those with which we have become acquainted  through the cuneiform inscriptions, I have chosen the forms most adapted  to our German modes of speech, and in the present edition have placed  those few explanations which seemed to me indispensable to the right  understanding of the text, at the foot of the page, instead of among the  less easily accessible notes at the end.    The fact that displeasure has been excited among men of letters by this  attempt to clothe the hardly-earned results of severer studies in an  imaginative form is even clearer to me now than when I first sent this  book before the public. In some points I agree with this judgment, but  that the act is kindly received, when a scholar does not scorn to render  the results of his investigations accessible to the largest number of  the educated class, in the form most generally interesting to them, is  proved by the rapid sale of the first large edition of this work. I  know at least of no better means than those I have chosen, by which to  instruct and suggest thought to an extended circle of readers. Those who  read learned books evince in so doing a taste for such studies; but it  may easily chance that the following pages, though taken up only for  amusement, may excite a desire for more information, and even gain a  disciple for the study of ancient history.    Considering our scanty knowledge of the domestic life of the Greeks and  Persians before the Persian war--of Egyptian manners we know more--even  the most severe scholar could scarcely dispense with the assistance  of his imagination, when attempting to describe private life among the  civilized nations of the sixth century before Christ. He would however  escape all danger of those anachronisms to which the author of such a  work as I have undertaken must be hopelessly liable. With attention and  industry, errors of an external character may be avoided, but if I had  chosen to hold myself free from all consideration of the times in which  I and my readers have come into the world, and the modes of thought at  present existing among us, and had attempted to depict nothing but the  purely ancient characteristics of the men and their times, I should have  become unintelligible to many of my readers, uninteresting to all, and  have entirely failed in my original object. My characters will therefore  look like Persians, Egyptians, &c., but in their language, even more  than in their actions, the German narrator will be perceptible, not  always superior to the sentimentality of his day, but a native of the  world in the nineteenth century after the appearance of that heavenly  Master, whose teaching left so deep an impression on human thought and  feeling.    The Persians and Greeks, being by descent related to ourselves,  present fewer difficulties in this respect than the Egyptians, whose  dwelling-place on the fruitful islands won by the Nile from the Desert,  completely isolated them from the rest of the world.    To Professor Lepsius, who suggested to me that a tale confined entirely  to Egypt and the Egyptians might become wearisome, I owe many thanks;  and following his hint, have so arranged the materials supplied by  Herodotus as to introduce my reader first into a Greek circle. Here he  will feel in a measure at home, and indeed will entirely sympathize with  them on one important point, viz.: in their ideas on the Beautiful and  on Art. Through this Hellenic portico he reaches Egypt, from thence  passes on to Persia and returns finally to the Nile. It has been my  desire that the three nations should attract him equally, and I have  therefore not centred the entire interest of the plot in one hero, but  have endeavored to exhibit each nation in its individual character, by  means of a fitting representative. The Egyptian Princess has given  her name to the book, only because the weal and woe of all my other  characters were decided by her fate, and she must therefore be regarded  as the central point of the whole.    In describing Amasis I have followed the excellent description of  Herodotus, which has been confirmed by a picture discovered on an  ancient monument. Herodotus has been my guide too in the leading  features of Cambyses' character; indeed as he was born only forty or  fifty years after the events related, his history forms the basis of my  romance.    \"Father of history\" though he be, I have not followed him blindly, but,  especially in the development of my characters, have chosen those paths  which the principles of psychology have enabled me to lay down for  myself, and have never omitted consulting those hieroglyphic and  cuneiform inscriptions which have been already deciphered. In most cases  these confirm the statements of Herodotus.    I have caused Bartja's murder to take place after the conquest of Egypt,  because I cannot agree with the usually received translation of the  Behistun inscription. This reads as follows: \"One named Cambujiya, son  of Curu, of our family, was king here formerly and had a brother named  Bartiya, of the same father and the same mother as Cambujiya. Thereupon  Cambujiya killed that Bartiya.\" In a book intended for general readers,  it would not be well to enter into a discussion as to niceties of  language, but even the uninitiated will see that the word \"thereupon\"  has no sense in this connection. In every other point the inscription  agrees with Herodotus' narrative, and I believe it possible to bring it  into agreement with that of Darius on this last as well; but reserve my  proofs for another time and place.    It has not been ascertained from whence Herodotus has taken the name  Smerdis which he gives to Bartja and Gaumata. The latter occurs again,  though in a mutilated form, in Justin.    My reasons for making Phanes an Athenian will be found in Note 90. Vol.  I. This coercion of an authenticated fact might have been avoided in the  first edition, but could not now be altered without important changes in  the entire text. The means I have adopted in my endeavor to make Nitetis  as young as possible need a more serious apology; as, notwithstanding  Herodotus' account of the mildness of Amasis' rule, it is improbable  that King Hophra should have been alive twenty years after his fall.  Even this however is not impossible, for it can be proved that his  descendants were not persecuted by Amasis.    On a Stela in the Leyden Museum I have discovered that a certain  Psamtik, a member of the fallen dynasty, lived till the 17th year of  Amasis' reign, and died at the age of seventy-five.    Lastly let me be permitted to say a word or two in reference to  Rhodopis. That she must have been a remarkable woman is evident from the  passage in Herodotus quoted in Notes 10, and 14, Vol. I., and from the  accounts given by many other writers. Her name, \"the rosy-cheeked one,\"  tells us that she was beautiful, and her amiability and charm of manner  are expressly praised by Herodotus. How richly she was endowed with  gifts and graces may be gathered too from the manner in which tradition  and fairy lore have endeavored to render her name immortal.

ABSTRACT: This report describes the activities of an estimated     1,000 personnel, both military and civilian, in Project TRINITY, which     culminated in detonation of the first nuclear device, in New Mexico in     1945.  Scientific and diagnostic experiments to evaluate the effects     of the nuclear device were the primary activities engaging military     personnel.        FACT SHEET      Defense Nuclear Agency  Public Affairs Office  Washington, D C. 20305    Subject: Project TRINITY    Project TRINITY, conducted by the Manhattan Engineer District (MED),  was designed to test and assess the effects of a nuclear weapon.  The  TRINITY nuclear device was detonated on a 100-foot tower on the  Alamogordo Bombing Range in south-central New Mexico at 0530 hours on  16 July 1945.  The nuclear yield of the detonation was equivalent to  the energy released by detonating 19 kilotons of TNT.  At shot-time,  the temperature was 21.8 degrees Celsius, and surface air pressure was  850 millibars.  The winds were nearly calm at the surface; at 10,300  feet above mean sea level, they were from the southwest at 10 knots.  The winds blew the cloud resulting from the detonation to the  northeast.  From 16 July 1945 through 1946, about 1,000 military and  civilian personnel took part in Project TRINITY or visited the test  site.  The location of the test site and its major installations are  shown in the accompanying figures.      Military and Scientific Activities    All participants in Project TRINITY, both military and civilian, were  under the authority of the MED.  No military exercises were conducted.  The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), which was staffed and  administered by the University of California (under contract to the  MED), conducted diagnostic experiments.  Civilian and military  scientists and technicians, with assistance from other military  personnel, placed gauges, detectors, and other instruments around  ground zero before the detonation.  Four offsite monitoring posts were  established in the towns of Nogal, Roswell, Socorro, and Fort Sumner,  New Mexico.  An evacuation detachment consisting of 144 to 160  enlisted men and officers was established in case protective measures  or evacuation of civilians living offsite became necessary.  At least  94 of these personnel were from the Provisional Detachment Number 1,  Company \"B,\" of the 9812th Technical Service Unit, Army Corps of  Engineers.  Military police cleared the test area and recorded the  locations of all personnel before the detonation.    A radiological monitor was assigned to each of the three shelters,  which were located to the north, west, and south of ground zero.  Soon  after the detonation, the monitors surveyed the area immediately  around the shelters and then proceeded out the access road to its  intersection with the main road, Broadway.  Personnel not essential to  postshot activities were transferred from the west and south shelters  to the Base Camp, about 16 kilometers southwest of ground zero.  Personnel at the north shelter were evacuated when a sudden rise in  radiation levels was detected; it was later learned that the  instrument had not been accurately calibrated and levels had not  increased as much as the instrument indicated.  Specially designated  groups conducted onsite and offsite radiological surveys.      Safety Standards and Procedures    The safety criteria established for Project TRINITY were based on  calculations of the anticipated dangers from blast pressure, thermal  radiation, and ionizing radiation.  The TR-7 Group, also known as the  Medical Group, was responsible for radiological safety.  A limit of 5  roentgens of exposure during a two-month period was established.    The Site and Offsite Monitoring Groups were both part of the Medical  Group.  The Site Monitoring Group was responsible for equipping  personnel with protective clothing and instruments to measure  radiation exposure, monitoring and recording personnel exposure  according to film badge readings and time spent in the test area, and  providing for personnel decontamination.  The Offsite Monitoring Group  surveyed areas surrounding the test site for radioactive fallout.  In  addition to these two monitoring groups, a small group of medical  technicians provided radiation detection instruments and monitoring.      Radiation Exposures at Project TRINITY    Dosimetry information is available for about 815 individuals who  either participated in Project TRINITY activities or visited the test  site between 16 July 1945 and 1 January 1947.  The listing does not  indicate the precise military or unit affiliation of all personnel.  Less than six percent of the Project TRINITY participants received  exposures greater than 2 roentgens.  Twenty-three of these  individuals received exposures greater than 2 but less than 4  roentgens; another 22 individuals received between 4 and 15 roentgens.        PREFACE      From 1945 to 1962, the U.S. Government, through the Manhattan Engineer  District (MED) and its successor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission  (AEC), conducted 235 tests of nuclear devices at sites in the United  States and in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  In all, an estimated  220,000 Department of Defense (DOD)* participants, both military and  civilian, were present at the tests.  Project TRINITY, the war-time  effort to test-fire a nuclear explosive device, was the first  atmospheric nuclear weapons test.     * The MED,"]]]
