WILLIAM A. WILLIAMS, D.D.                Designed (1) As an up-to-date text book, and a companion to all other      text books on evolution; and    (2) As an antidote to books in libraries teaching evolution,      infidelity and atheism; and    (3) As an aid to all students, parents, teachers, ministers, lawyers,      doctors, and all other lovers of the truth.          THE EVOLUTION OF MAN MATHEMATICALLY DISPROVED        INTRODUCTION      Let it be understood, at the outset, that every proved theory of  science is to be accepted. Only the most intense prejudice and the  maddest folly would lead any one to reject the proved conclusions of  science. Moreover, we should examine any new hypothesis with open  minds, to see if it has in it anything truthful, helpful or  advantageous.  It should neither be accepted nor rejected simply  because it is new. But if a theory is evidently or probably untrue, or  pernicious, or at all harmful, it is to be rejected and condemned.    Some facts and objections are herein submitted to the serious seeker  after truth, in the hope that a theory so out of harmony with the  facts, and so destructive to the faith and the cherished hopes of man,  may be completely discarded.  As Evolution can not stand the acid test  of mathematics, it will be repudiated by all.    We shall discuss the theory upon its merits, from a scientific  standpoint, and will also demand an explanation of all facts  concerned, as we have a right to do, even where they are associated  with the theological and the spiritual as well as the material. We do  not oppose true science but \"science falsely so called.\" We do not ban  research, but will not allow the wild vagaries of the imagination to  pass as truth.    We shall not declare arbitrarily that evolution is untrue; neither  will we allow scientists to decide what we shall believe. But we shall  appeal to the facts, and evolution must stand or fall by the  evidence. \"Evolution is not to be accepted until proved.\" It is not  yet proved and never will be.      MATHEMATICS THE ACID TEST.    Every theory to which mathematics can be applied will be proved or  disproved by this acid test. Figures will not lie, and mathematics  will not lie even at the demand of liars. Their testimony is as clear  as the mind of God.  Gravitation is proved a true theory by numerous  calculations, some of them the most abstruse. The Copernican theory is  proved true, and the Ptolemaic theory false, by mathematical  calculations. The calculations, leading to the discovery of Neptune,  went far to establish the Copernican theory as well as the law of  gravitation, and to disprove the Ptolemaic theory. The evolution  theory, especially as applied to man, likewise is disproved by  mathematics.  The proof is overwhelming and decisive.  Thus God makes  the noble science of mathematics bear testimony in favor of the true  theories and against the false theories. We shall endeavor to marshal  some of the mathematical proofs against the false and pernicious  theory of evolution. True theories, such as the gravitation and  Copernican theories, harmonize with each other as every branch of  mathematics harmonizes with every other. If evolution were true, it  would harmonize with all other true theories, rather than with so many  false theories.      THEORIES OF EVOLUTION    Evolution in one sense, means growth or development,--literally,  unrolling or unfolding. It is difficult to give a clear definition  that will apply to each of the various theories that are held.  Theories differ vastly in the extent of their application, as held by  their various advocates, resulting in great confusion of terms:--    1. The atheists believe that there is no God. Hence, matter was not  created, but was eternal, or came by chance. Only a mere handful of  the whole human race have ever yet believed such an untenable  doctrine. The existence of a Creator, is doubted or denied by extreme  atheistic evolutionists, who would dethrone God, \"exalt the monkey,  and degrade man.\"    2. The first of modern scientific men to adopt the theory that all  plants and animals, including man, are developed from certain original  simple germs, was Lamarck, a French naturalist, in 1809. He conceded  that God created matter,--nothing more. He believed in spontaneous  generation, which scientific investigation has utterly disproved.    3. Darwin goes a step further and concedes there may have been a  Creator of matter, and of one, or at most, a few germs, from which all  vegetation and all animals came by evolution,--all orders, classes,  families, genera, species, and varieties. He differs from Lamarck, by  allowing the creation of one germ, possibly a few more. He says in his  \"Origin of Species,\" \"I believe that animals are descended from at  most only four or five progenitors; and plants from an equal or lesser  number.... Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the  belief that all animals and plants are descended from one  prototype.... All the organic beings, which have ever lived on the  earth, may be descended from some _one_ primordial form.\" Darwin,  because of his great scholarship, fairness, and candor, won for his  theory more favor than it inherently deserves.  Darwin taught that,  \"The lower impulses of vegetable life pass, by insensible gradations,  into the instinct of animals and the higher intelligence of man,\"  without purpose or design. None of these three hypotheses can admit  the creation of man.    4. Other evolutionists, believing in the evolution of both plants and  animals, nevertheless refuse to believe in the evolution of man--the  most baneful application of the whole theory. Even if there were  convincing proof of the evolution of plants and animals from one germ,  there is no real proof of the evolution of man. To prove this is the  chief purpose of this book.    5. A fifth theory of evolution is held by many. It is called  polyphyletic evolution, which means that God created numerous stocks,  or beginnings of both plant and animal life, which were subject to  change and growth, deterioration and development, according to his  plan and purpose. So much of evolution in this sense as can be proved,  is in harmony with the Bible account of the creation of plants,  animals and man. The false theory of evolution is called the  monophyletic, which teaches that all species of plants and animals  including man, developed from one cell or germ which came by creation  or spontaneous generation. Evolution is used throughout this book in  this latter sense, unless otherwise indicated by the context. God does  not create by evolution, for it can only develop what already exists.    This book is divided into three parts: In Part One, material  evolution, especially the evolution of the human body, is  disproved. In Part Two, the alleged proofs of evolution are examined  and refuted. In Part Three, the evolution of the soul is shown to be  impossible.    There are in all fifty numbered arguments, including answers to the  arguments of evolutionists.          PART ONE    THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN BODY MATHEMATICALLY DISPROVED      Any scientific theory or hypothesis must be proved first possible,  then probable, then certain. To be a possible theory, it must be  reconcilable with many facts; to be a probable theory, it must be  reconcilable with many more; to be a certain and proven theory, it  must be reconcilable with _all_ the facts. Whenever it is  irreconcilable with _any_ fact, it should be rejected, as it can  not be a true theory.  Every true theory passes through these three  stages,--possibility, probability, and certainty. A theory is not  science, until it is certainly true, and so becomes knowledge.  The  evolution of man from the brute is in the throes of a desperate  struggle to show that it may possibly be a true theory or  hypothesis. Yet some who are ready to admit that they are  \"scientists,\" claim evolution a proven theory.    If it can be shown possible for man to have descended or ascended from  the lower animals, it will require enormous additional evidence to  show that such descent is probable; and still much more to make it  certain.    Every scientific theory, proposed as _possible_, is reconcilable  with some facts. Otherwise, it would not have been considered for a  moment. Many false hypotheses have been proposed, and accepted as  possible and even probable, because reconcilable with some facts. The  Ptolemaic theory of the universe, making the earth the centre, around  which the heavens revolved in great concentric spheres, was accepted  for 1400 years from A. D.  140, because it explained many things. It  corresponded with appearances. It appealed to all. Its advocates had  great difficulty in reconciling it with the motions of the planets,  which were therefore called planets or \"wanderers.\"  But in time the  Copernican theory prevailed, because it was reconcilable with all the  facts. The evidence is so abundant that all claim it the true  theory. It is science. It is knowledge.    Because the Copernican hypothesis, the true theory of the universe,  was opposed and rejected, it does not follow that the evolution of man  is true because it is likewise opposed and rejected. If this new  theory, hypothesis, or guess stands, it can only do so, because it  harmonizes with all the facts. The law of gravitation, and every other  proven theory harmonizes with all the facts and with all other true  theories.    It will be shown in this book, that a large number of facts can not be  reconciled with evolution, especially the evolution of man, thus  proving that it can not be a true theory. We really have a right to  demand the proof of a theory, and to refuse consent until  proved. While we are under no obligation to _disprove_ an  unproven theory, yet it is the shortest way to settle the matter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#1)"],[1,"AND EDUCATION    by John Dewey          Transcriber's Note: I have tried to make this the most accurate text  possible but I am sure that there are still mistakes.

Renewal of Life by Transmission. The most notable distinction between  living and inanimate things is that the former maintain themselves by  renewal. A stone when struck resists. If its resistance is greater than  the force of the blow struck, it remains outwardly unchanged. Otherwise,  it is shattered into smaller bits. Never does the stone attempt to react  in such a way that it may maintain itself against the blow, much less so  as to render the blow a contributing factor to its own continued action.  While the living thing may easily be crushed by superior force, it none  the less tries to turn the energies which act upon it into means of its  own further existence. If it cannot do so, it does not just split into  smaller pieces (at least in the higher forms of life), but loses its  identity as a living thing.    As long as it endures, it struggles to use surrounding energies in its  own behalf. It uses light, air, moisture, and the material of soil. To  say that it uses them is to say that it turns them into means of its own  conservation. As long as it is growing, the energy it expends in thus  turning the environment to account is more than compensated for by  the return it gets: it grows. Understanding the word \"control\" in this  sense, it may be said that a living being is one that subjugates  and controls for its own continued activity the energies that would  otherwise use it up. Life is a self-renewing process through action upon  the environment.    In all the higher forms this process cannot be kept up indefinitely.  After a while they succumb; they die. The creature is not equal to the  task of indefinite self-renewal. But continuity of the life process  is not dependent upon the prolongation of the existence of any one  individual. Reproduction of other forms of life goes on in continuous  sequence. And though, as the geological record shows, not merely  individuals but also species die out, the life process continues in  increasingly complex forms. As some species die out, forms better  adapted to utilize the obstacles against which they struggled in vain  come into being. Continuity of life means continual readaptation of the  environment to the needs of living organisms.    We have been speaking of life in its lowest terms--as a physical thing.  But we use the word \"Life\" to denote the whole range of experience,  individual and racial. When we see a book called the Life of Lincoln  we do not expect to find within its covers a treatise on physiology.  We look for an account of social antecedents; a description of early  surroundings, of the conditions and occupation of the family; of the  chief episodes in the development of character; of signal struggles and  achievements; of the individual's hopes, tastes, joys and sufferings. In  precisely similar fashion we speak of the life of a savage tribe, of  the Athenian people, of the American nation. \"Life\" covers customs,  institutions, beliefs, victories and defeats, recreations and  occupations.    We employ the word \"experience\" in the same pregnant sense. And to it,  as well as to life in the bare physiological sense, the principle  of continuity through renewal applies. With the renewal of physical  existence goes, in the case of human beings, the recreation of beliefs,  ideals, hopes, happiness, misery, and practices. The continuity of any  experience, through renewing of the social group, is a literal fact.  Education, in its broadest sense, is the means of this social continuity  of life. Every one of the constituent elements of a social group, in a  modern city as in a savage tribe, is born immature, helpless, without  language, beliefs, ideas, or social standards. Each individual, each  unit who is the carrier of the life-experience of his group, in time  passes away. Yet the life of the group goes on.    The primary ineluctable facts of the birth and death of each one of  the constituent members in a social group determine the necessity of  education. On one hand, there is the contrast between the immaturity of  the new-born members of the group--its future sole representatives--and  the maturity of the adult members who possess the knowledge and customs  of the group. On the other hand, there is the necessity that these  immature members be not merely physically preserved in adequate numbers,  but that they be initiated into the interests, purposes, information,  skill, and practices of the mature members: otherwise the group will  cease its characteristic life. Even in a savage tribe, the achievements  of adults are far beyond what the immature members would be capable of  if left to themselves. With the growth of civilization, the gap between  the original capacities of the immature and the standards and customs of  the elders increases. Mere physical growing up, mere mastery of the bare  necessities of subsistence will not suffice to reproduce the life of  the group. Deliberate effort and the taking of thoughtful pains are  required. Beings who are born not only unaware of, but quite indifferent  to, the aims and habits of the social group have to be rendered  cognizant of them and actively interested. Education, and education  alone, spans the gap.    Society exists through a process of transmission quite as much as  biological life. This transmission occurs by means of communication of  habits of doing, thinking, and feeling from the older to the younger.  Without this communication of ideals, hopes, expectations, standards,  opinions, from those members of society who are passing out of the group  life to those who are coming into it, social life could not survive.  If the members who compose a society lived on continuously, they  might educate the new-born members, but it would be a task directed  by personal interest rather than social need. Now it is a work of  necessity.    If a plague carried off the members of a society all at once, it is  obvious that the group would be permanently done for. Yet the death of  each of its constituent members is as certain as if an epidemic took  them all at once. But the graded difference in age, the fact that some  are born as some die, makes possible through transmission of ideas and  practices the constant reweaving of the social fabric. Yet this renewal  is not automatic. Unless pains are taken to see that genuine and  thorough transmission takes place, the most civilized group will relapse  into barbarism and then into savagery. In fact, the human young are so  immature that if they were left to themselves without the guidance  and succor of others, they could not acquire the rudimentary abilities  necessary for physical existence. The young of human beings compare  so poorly in original efficiency with the young of many of the lower  animals, that even the powers needed for physical sustentation have to  be acquired under tuition. How much more, then, is this the case with  respect to all the technological, artistic, scientific, and moral  achievements of humanity!    2. Education and Communication. So obvious, indeed, is the necessity of  teaching and learning for the continued existence of a society that we  may seem to be dwelling unduly on a truism. But justification is found  in the fact that such emphasis is a means of getting us away from an  unduly scholastic and formal notion of education. Schools are, indeed,  one important method of the transmission which forms the dispositions  of the immature; but it is only one means, and, compared with other  agencies, a relatively superficial means. Only as we have grasped the  necessity of more fundamental and persistent modes of tuition can we  make sure of placing the scholastic methods in their true context.    Society not only continues to exist by transmission, by communication,  but it may fairly be said to exist in transmission, in communication.  There is more than a verbal tie between the words common, community,  and communication. Men live in a community in virtue of the things which  they have in "]]]
