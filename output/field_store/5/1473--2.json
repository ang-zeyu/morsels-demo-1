THE STARS AND NEBULAE      INDEX        PREFACE      An attempt has been made in these pages to trace the evolution of  intellectual thought in the progress of astronomical discovery, and,  by recognising the different points of view of the different ages, to  give due credit even to the ancients. No one can expect, in a history  of astronomy of limited size, to find a treatise on \"practical\" or on  \"theoretical astronomy,\" nor a complete \"descriptive astronomy,\" and  still less a book on \"speculative astronomy.\" Something of each of  these is essential, however, for tracing the progress of thought and  knowledge which it is the object of this History to describe.    The progress of human knowledge is measured by the increased habit of  looking at facts from new points of view, as much as by the  accumulation of facts. The mental capacity of one age does not seem to  differ from that of other ages; but it is the imagination of new  points of view that gives a wider scope to that capacity. And this is  cumulative, and therefore progressive. Aristotle viewed the solar  system as a geometrical problem; Kepler and Newton converted the point  of view into a dynamical one. Aristotle's mental capacity to  understand the meaning of facts or to criticise a train of reasoning  may have been equal to that of Kepler or Newton, but the point of view  was different.    Then, again, new points of view are provided by the invention of new  methods in that system of logic which we call mathematics. All that  mathematics can do is to assure us that a statement A is equivalent to  statements B, C, D, or is one of the facts expressed by the statements  B, C, D; so that we may know, if B, C, and D are true, then A is true.  To many people our inability to understand all that is contained in  statements B, C, and D, without the cumbrous process of a mathematical  demonstration, proves the feebleness of the human mind as a logical  machine. For it required the new point of view imagined by Newton's  analysis to enable people to see that, so far as planetary orbits are  concerned, Kepler's three laws (B, C, D) were identical with Newton's  law of gravitation (A). No one recognises more than the mathematical  astronomer this feebleness of the human intellect, and no one is more  conscious of the limitations of the logical process called  mathematics, which even now has not solved directly the problem of  only three bodies.    These reflections, arising from the writing of this History, go to  explain the invariable humility of the great mathematical astronomers.  Newton's comparison of himself to the child on the seashore applies to  them all. As each new discovery opens up, it may be, boundless oceans  for investigation, for wonder, and for admiration, the great  astronomers, refusing to accept mere hypotheses as true, have founded  upon these discoveries a science as exact in its observation of facts  as in theories. So it is that these men, who have built up the most  sure and most solid of all the sciences, refuse to invite others to  join them in vain speculation. The writer has, therefore, in this  short History, tried to follow that great master, Airy, whose pupil he  was, and the key to whose character was exactness and accuracy; and he  recognises that Science is impotent except in her own limited sphere.    It has been necessary to curtail many parts of the History in the  attempt--perhaps a hopeless one--to lay before the reader in a limited  space enough about each age to illustrate its tone and spirit, the  ideals of the workers, the gradual addition of new points of view and  of new means of investigation.    It would, indeed, be a pleasure to entertain the hope that these pages  might, among new recruits, arouse an interest in the greatest of all  the sciences, or that those who have handled the theoretical or  practical side might be led by them to read in the original some of  the classics of astronomy. Many students have much compassion for the  schoolboy of to-day, who is not allowed the luxury of learning the art  of reasoning from him who still remains pre-eminently its greatest  exponent, Euclid. These students pity also the man of to-morrow, who  is not to be allowed to read, in the original Latin of the brilliant  Kepler, how he was able--by observations taken from a moving platform,  the earth, of the directions of a moving object, Mars--to deduce the  exact shape of the path of each of these planets, and their actual  positions on these paths at any time. Kepler's masterpiece is one of  the most interesting books that was ever written, combining wit,  imagination, ingenuity, and certainty.    Lastly, it must be noted that, as a History of England cannot deal  with the present Parliament, so also the unfinished researches and  untested hypotheses of many well-known astronomers of to-day cannot be  included among the records of the History of Astronomy. The writer  regrets the necessity that thus arises of leaving without mention the  names of many who are now making history in astronomical work.    G. F.  _August 1st, 1909._          BOOK I.  THE GEOMETRICAL PERIOD        1. PRIMITIVE ASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY.      The growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in  that of the individual, especially in the earliest stages.  Intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in  both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences, and on the  comparison, classification, arrangement, and nomenclature of these  experiences. During the infancy of each the succession of events can  be watched, but there can be no _a priori_ anticipations.  Experience alone, in both cases, leads to the idea of cause and effect  as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe, as a rule  for predicting the course of events, and as a guide to the choice of a  course of action. This idea of cause and effect is the most potent  factor in developing the history of the human race, as of the  individual.    In no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more  conspicuous than in astronomy; and we fall into the habit of thinking  of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe, but  necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been  substituted in its place. The first inhabitants of the world were  compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual  alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold, as much as to  the irregular changes of weather, attacks of disease, and the fortune  of war.  They soon came to regard the influence of the sun, in  connection with light and heat, as a cause. This led to a search for  other signs in the heavens. If the appearance of a comet was sometimes  noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler, or an eclipse  with a scourge of plague, these might well be looked upon as causes in  the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as  a cause of fine or foul weather.    For these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have  recorded the occurrence of comets, eclipses, new stars, meteor  showers, and remarkable conjunctions of the planets, as well as  plagues and famines, floods and droughts, wars and the deaths of great  rulers. Sometimes they thought they could trace connections which  might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine, or an eclipse  war.    Even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and  effect which now seem to us absurd, let us be tolerant, and gratefully  acknowledge that these astrologers, when they suggested such \"working  hypotheses,\" were laying the foundations of observation and deduction.    If the ancient Chaldaeans gave to the planetary conjunctions an  influence over terrestrial events, let us remember that in our own  time people have searched for connection between terrestrial  conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots; while De la  Rue, Loewy, and Balfour Stewart[1] thought they found a connection  between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions. Thus we find  scientific men, even in our own time, responsible for the belief that  storms in the Indian Ocean, the fertility of German vines, famines in  India, and high or low Nile-floods in Egypt follow the planetary  positions.    And, again, the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we  cannot blame the ancient Greeks for announcing the influence of the  moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in Lord Wolseley's  _Soldier's Pocket Book_.

LONDON:               BRITISH ESPERANTO ASSOCIATION (Incorporated),                          17, Hart Street, W.C.I.                         *       *       *       *       *                                   PRESENTATION.    Perhaps to no one is Esperanto of more service than to the  non-grammarian. It gives him for a minimum expenditure of time and money  a valuable insight into the principles of grammar and the meaning of  words, while enabling him, after only a few months of study, to get into  communication with his fellow men in all parts of the world.    To place these advantages within easy reach of all is the aim of this  little book. Written by an experienced teacher, revised by Mr. E. A.  Millidge, and based on the exercises of Dr. Zamenhof himself, it merits  the fullest confidence of the student, and may be heartily commended to  all into whose hands it may come.                                                             W. W. PADFIELD.                                      PREFACE.    This little book has been prepared in the hope of helping those who,  having forgotten the lessons in grammar which they received at school,  find some difficulty in learning Esperanto from the existing textbooks.  It is hoped it will be found useful not only for solitary students, but  also for class work.    The exercises are taken chiefly from the \"Ekzercaro\" of Dr. Zamenhof.  The compiler also acknowledges her indebtedness especially to the  \"Standard Course of Esperanto,\" by Mr. G. W. Bullen, and to the  \"Esperanto Grammar and Commentary,\" by Major-General Geo. Cox, and while  accepting the whole responsibility for all inaccuracies and crudenesses,  she desires to thank all who have helped in the preparation, and  foremost among them Mr. W. W. Padfield, of Ipswich, for advice and  encouragement throughout the work, and to Mr. E. A. Millidge, for his  unfailing kindness and invaluable counsel and help in its preparation  and revision.                             MANNER OF USING THE BOOK.    The student is strongly advised to cultivate the habit of thinking in  Esperanto from the very beginning of the study. To do this he should  try to realise the idea mentally without putting it into English words,  e.g., when learning the word \"rozo\" or \"kolombo,\" let him bring the  object itself before his mind's eye, instead of repeating \"'rozo',  rose; 'kolombo', pigeon\"; or with the sentence \"'la suno brilas', the  sun shines,\" let him picture the sun shining. Having studied the lesson  and learned the vocabulary, he should read the exercise, repeating each  sentence aloud until he has become familiar with it and can pronounce  it freely. Then turning to the English translation at the end of the  book, he should write the exercise into Esperanto, compare it with  the original, and re-learn and re-write if necessary. Although this  method may require a little more time and trouble at first, the greater  facility gained in speaking the language will well repay the outlay.    After mastering this book the student should take some reader, such  as \"Unua Legolibro,\" by Dr. Kabe, and then proceed to the \"Fundamenta  Krestomatio,\" the standard work on Esperanto, by Dr. Zamenhof.    A very good Esperanto-English vocabulary is to be found in the  \"Esperanto Key,\" 1/2d., or in \"The Whole of Esperanto for a Penny.\"                          THE ORIGIN AND AIM OF ESPERANTO.    A few words as to the origin of Esperanto will perhaps not be out  of place here. The author of the language, Dr. Ludovic Zamenhof, a  Polish Jew, was born on December 3rd, 1859, at Bielovstok, in Poland,  a town whose inhabitants are of four distinct races, Poles, Russians,  Germans, and Jews, each with their own language and customs, and  often at open enmity with each other. Taught at home that all men are  brethren, Zamenhof found everywhere around him outside the denial of  this teaching, and even as a child came to the conclusion that the races  hated, because they could not understand, each other. Feeling keenly,  too, the disabilities under which his people specially laboured, being  cut off by their language from the people among whom they lived, while  too proud to learn the language of their persecutors, he set himself to  invent a language which should be neutral and therefore not require any  sacrifice of pride on the part of any race.    Interesting as is the story of Zamenhof's attempts and difficulties, it  must suffice here to say that at the end of 1878 the new language was  sufficiently advanced for him to impart it to schoolfellows like-minded  with himself, and on December 17th of that year they feted its birth,  and sang a hymn in the new language, celebrating the reign of unity and  peace which should be brought about by its means, \"All mankind must  be united in one family.\" But the enthusiasm of its first followers  died down under the derision they encountered, and for nine years more  Zamenhof worked in secret at his language, translating, composing,  writing original articles, improving, polishing, till in 1887 he  published his first book under the title of \"An International Language  by Dr. Esperanto.\" (\"Esperanto\" means \"one who hopes\").    That the idea which impelled the young Zamenhof to undertake such a work  is still the mainspring of his devotion to the cause is shown by the  following extract from his opening speech at the second International  Esperanto Congress in 1906:--\"We are all conscious that it is not  the thought of its practical utility which inspires us to work for  Esperanto, but only the thought of the important and holy idea which  underlies an international language. This idea, you all know, is that  of: brotherhood and justice among all peoples.\" And, again, in his  presidential address at the third Esperanto Congress, held this year  (1907) at Cambridge, he said, \"We are constantly repeating that we do  not wish to interfere in the internal life of the nations, but only to  build a bridge between the peoples. The ideal aim of Esperantists, never  until now exactly formulated, but always clearly felt, is: To establish  a neutral foundation, on which the various races of mankind may hold  peaceful, brotherly intercourse, without intruding on each other their  racial differences.\"       Sur neuxtrala lingva fundamento,     Komprenante unu la alian,     La popoloj faros en konsento     Unu grandan rondon familian.       (On the foundation of a neutral language,     Understanding one another,     The peoples will form in agreement     One great family circle).                                                                HELEN FRYER.    December, 1907.                                   THE ALPHABET.                               SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.    In Esperanto each letter has only one sound, and each sound is  represented in only one way. The words are pronounced exactly as spelt,  every letter being sounded.    Those CONSONANTS which in English have one simple sound only are exactly  the same in Esperanto; they are--b, d, f, k, l, m, n, p, r, t, v, z (r  must be well rolled).    q, w, x, y are not used.    c, g, h, s, which in English represent more than one sound, and j are  also used with the mark ^--                     c cx,   g gx,   h hx,   j jx,   s sx.    c - (whose two English sounds are represented by k and s) has the sound  of TS, as in iTS, TSar.    cx - like CH, TCH, in CHurCH, maTCH.    g - hard, as in Go, GiG, Gun.    gx - soft, as in Gentle, Gem, or like J in Just, Jew.    h - well breathed, as in Horse, Home, How.    hx - strongly breathed, and in the throat, as in the Scotch word loCH.  (Ask any Scotsman to pronounce it). Hx occurs but seldom. It is the  Irish GH in louGH, and the Welsh CH.    j - like Y in Yes, You, or J in halleluJah, fJord.    jx - like S in pleaSure, or the French J, as in deJeuner, Jean d'Arc.    s - like SS in aSS, leSS, never like S in roSe.    sx - like SH in SHe, SHall, SHip, or S in Sugar, Sure.    In newspapers, etc., which have not the proper type, cx, gx, hx, jx, sx  are often replaced by ch, gh, hh, jh, sh, or by c', g', h', j', s', and  ux by u.    ux - is also a consonant, and has the sound of W in We, as EUXropo, or U  in persUade.    The VOWELS a, e, i, o, u have not the English, but the Continental  sounds.    a - always like A in Ah! or in tArt.    e - like E in bEnd, but broader, like E in thEre.    i - is a sound between EE in mEEt and I in Is.    o - like O in fOr, or in the Scottish NO, or AU in AUght.    u - like OO in bOOt, pOOr.    a, e, i, o, u are all simple sounds, that is, the mouth is kept in one  position while they are being sounded. In learning them lengthen them  out, and be careful not to alter the position of the mouth, however long  they are drawn out. In the compound sounds given below the shape of the  mouth changes; to get the correct pronunciation sound each letter fully  and distinctly, gradually bringing them closer until they run together,  when they become almost as follows:--    aj - nearly like AI in AIsle, or I in nIce, fIne.    ej - nearly like EI in vEIn.    oj - nearly like OY in bOY, or OI in vOId.    uj - nearly like UJ in hallelUJah.    aux - like AHW, or nearly OU in hOUse, pronounced broadly, haOUse.    eux - like EHW, or EY W in thEY Were, AYW in wAYWard.    Practise saying aja, eja, oja, uja, auxa, euxa several times"]]]
