He might  shelter himself under the plea that every anonymous writer is, like the  celebrated Junius, only a phantom, and that therefore, although an  apparition, of a more benign, as well as much meaner description, he  cannot be bound to plead to a charge of inconsistency. A better apology  may be found in the imitating the confession of honest Benedict, that,  when he said he would die a bachelor, he did not think he should live to  be married. The best of all would be, if, as has eminently happened in  the case of some distinguished contemporaries, the merit of the work  should, in the reader's estimation, form an excuse for the Author's  breach of promise. Without presuming to hope that this may prove the  case, it is only further necessary to mention, that his resolution, like  that of Benedict, fell a sacrifice, to temptation at least, if not to  stratagem.    It is now about six months since the Author, through the medium of his  respectable Publishers, received a parcel of Papers, containing the  Outlines of this narrative, with a permission, or rather with a request,  couched in highly flattering terms, that they might be given to the  Public, with such alterations as should be found suitable.*    * As it maybe necessary, in the present Edition(1829), to speak upon the  square, the Author thinks it proper to own, that the communication  alluded to is entirely imaginary.    These were of course so numerous, that, besides the suppression of names,  and of incidents approaching too much to reality, the work may in a great  measure be, said to be new written. Several anachronisms have probably  crept in during the course of these changes; and the mottoes for the  Chapters have been selected without any reference to the supposed date of  the incidents. For these, of course, the Editor is responsible. Some  others occurred in the original materials, but they are of little  consequence. In point of minute accuracy, it may be stated, that the  bridge over the Forth, or rather the Avondhu (or Black River), near the  hamlet of Aberfoil, had not an existence thirty years ago. It does not,  however, become the Editor to be the first to point out these errors; and  he takes this public opportunity to thank the unknown and nameless  correspondent, to whom the reader will owe the principal share of any  amusement which he may derive from the following pages.    1st December 1817.          INTRODUCTION---(1829)    When the author projected this further encroachment on the patience of an  indulgent public, he was at some loss for a title; a good name being very  nearly of as much consequence in literature as in life. The title of _Rob  Roy_ was suggested by the late Mr. Constable, whose sagacity and  experience foresaw the germ of popularity which it included.    No introduction can be more appropriate to the work than some account of  the singular character whose name is given to the title-page, and who,  through good report and bad report, has maintained a wonderful degree of  importance in popular recollection. This cannot be ascribed to the  distinction of his birth, which, though that of a gentleman, had in it  nothing of high destination, and gave him little right to command in his  clan. Neither, though he lived a busy, restless, and enterprising life,  were his feats equal to those of other freebooters, who have been less  distinguished. He owed his fame in a great measure to his residing on the  very verge of the Highlands, and playing such pranks in the beginning of  the 18th century, as are usually ascribed to Robin Hood in the middle  ages,--and that within forty miles of Glasgow, a great commercial city,  the seat of a learned university. Thus a character like his, blending the  wild virtues, the subtle policy, and unrestrained license of an American  Indian, was flourishing in Scotland during the Augustan age of Queen Anne  and George I. Addison, it is probable, or Pope, would have been  considerably surprised if they had known that there existed in the same  island with them a personage of Rob Roy's peculiar habits and profession.  It is this strong contrast betwixt the civilised and cultivated mode of  life on the one side of the Highland line, and the wild and lawless  adventures which were habitually undertaken and achieved by one who dwelt  on the opposite side of that ideal boundary, which creates the interest  attached to his name. Hence it is that even yet,                        Far and near, through vale and hill,                        Are faces that attest the same,                    And kindle like a fire new stirr'd,                        At sound of Rob Roy's name.    There were several advantages which Rob Roy enjoyed for sustaining to  advantage the character which he assumed.    The most prominent of these was his descent from, and connection with,  the clan MacGregor, so famous for their misfortunes, and the indomitable  spirit with which they maintained themselves as a clan, linked and banded  together in spite of the most severe laws, executed with unheard-of  rigour against those who bore this forbidden surname. Their history was  that of several others of the original Highland clans, who were  suppressed by more powerful neighbours, and either extirpated, or forced  to secure themselves by renouncing their own family appellation, and  assuming that of the conquerors. The peculiarity in the story of the  MacGregors, is their retaining, with such tenacity, their separate  existence and union as a clan under circumstances of the utmost urgency.  The history of the tribe is briefly as follows--But we must premise that  the tale depends in some degree on tradition; therefore, excepting when  written documents are, quoted, it must be considered as in some degree  dubious.    The sept of MacGregor claimed a descent from Gregor, or Gregorius, third  son, it is said, of Alpin King of Scots, who flourished about 787. Hence  their original patronymic is MacAlpine, and they are usually termed the  Clan Alpine. An individual tribe of them retains the same name. They are  accounted one of the most ancient clans in the Highlands, and it is  certain they were a people of original Celtic descent, and occupied at  one period very extensive possessions in Perthshire and Argyleshire,  which they imprudently continued to hold by the _coir a glaive,_ that is,  the right of the sword. Their neighbours, the Earls of Argyle and  Breadalbane, in the meanwhile, managed to leave the lands occupied by the  MacGregors engrossed in those charters which they easily obtained from  the Crown; and thus constituted a legal right in their own favour,  without much regard to its justice. As opportunity occurred of annoying  or extirpating their neighbours, they gradually extended their own  domains, by usurping, under the pretext of such royal grants, those of  their more uncivilised neighbours. A Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochow, known  in the Highlands by the name of _Donacha Dhu nan Churraichd,_ that is,  Black Duncan with the Cowl, it being his pleasure to wear such a  head-gear, is said to have been peculiarly successful in those acts of  spoliation upon the clan MacGregor.    The devoted sept, ever finding themselves iniquitously driven from their  possessions, defended themselves by force, and occasionally gained  advantages, which they used cruelly enough. This conduct, though natural,  considering the country and time, was studiously represented at the  capital as arising from an untameable and innate ferocity, which nothing,  it was said, could remedy, save cutting off the tribe of MacGregor root  and branch.    In an act of Privy Council at Stirling, 22d September 1563, in the reign  of Queen Mary, commission is granted to the most powerful nobles, and  chiefs of the clans, to pursue the clan Gregor with fire and sword. A  similar warrant in 1563, not only grants the like powers to Sir John  Campbell of Glenorchy, the descendant of Duncan with the Cowl, but  discharges the lieges to receive or assist any of the clan Gregor, or  afford them, under any colour whatever, meat, drink, or clothes.    An atrocity which the clan Gregor committed in 1589, by the murder of  John Drummond of Drummond-ernoch, a forester of the royal forest of  Glenartney, is elsewhere given, with all its horrid circumstances. The  clan swore upon the severed head of the murdered man, that they would  make common cause in avowing the deed. This led to an act of the Privy  Council, directing another crusade against the \"wicked clan Gregor, so  long continuing in blood, slaughter, theft, and robbery,\" in which  letters of fire and sword are denounced against them for the space of  three years. The reader will find this particular fact illustrated in the  Introduction to the Legend of Montrose in the present edition of these  Novels.    Other occasions frequently occurred, in which the MacGregors testified  contempt for the laws, from which they had often experienced severity,  but never protection. Though they were gradually deprived of their  possessions, and of all ordinary means of procuring subsistence, they  could not, nevertheless, be supposed likely to starve for famine, while  they had the means of taking from strangers what they considered as  rightfully their own.

B. SHAW        FIRST PREFACE    For many years in our work among children, we have felt the need of  something similar to this book.    The cuts are made especially for this work. Pictures in this book will  suggest thoughts of God and heaven and awaken desires to live pure lives  which will sooner or later result in the salvation of many of our young  readers. God bless all our readers.    --S. B. Shaw    We are sure these stories will interest you children (and most older  people, too). Especially good and true stories like these. In all that  we have selected there are precious lessons of kindness and sympathy and  obedience, gratitude, courage, and faithfulness: then there are two other  very important lessons which I wish you to learn. The first is that  children can be and should be true Christians, that is, have their sins  forgiven for Jesus' sake and their hearts changed so that they love God  and the right and hate everything that is wrong. The second lesson is  that we must be Christians to be ready to live or ready to die. You will  find in this book several accounts of happy deaths of Christian children,  and you will find also much that tells of the good done by happy Christian  children that lived.    --Mrs. S. B. Shaw.        DEDICATION    When I was a little girl about nine years old, my mother gave me the  book, \"Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers To Prayer,\" for children.  This book was published by Brother and Sister Shaw.    I still have that book, which is about fifty-nine years old, and I have  enjoyed the stories it contained many times. One time while teaching a  Sunday School class I gave them each one of these books. They liked them  very much, but there came a time when you could not buy these books, as  other modern books took their place. But I feel that books like this one  are still needed, and I am sure that if Brother and Sister Shaw were  living they would like to see the stories sent out again to the children.  We are adding a few more true stories.    So we are praying God's blessings upon this book and dedicating it to  the memory of Brother and Sister Shaw who printed the first book in 1895.    Yours in Him,    Laura M. Conkle    (This dedication was written in 1955 for the first reprint edition.)

The heathen go astray, speaking  lies as soon as they are born. In China a mother will give her boy a  reward for the best falsehood that he can tell. Beginning so early, and  regarding it such a fine thing to tell wrong stories, they become skillful  in falsehoods. Some parents in Christian America are very careless in  this matter. It made my heart ache one day when I saw a lady in a street  car trying to keep her little boy awake by telling him that, if he went  to sleep, that man who had all those teeth in his window (referring to  a dentist's office they had passed) would come into the car and pull  every tooth out of his mouth. The little fellow looked up dreadfully  scared, and did his best to keep awake: but I thought to myself, when  he finds out what a wrong story his mother has told, he will not believe  her even when she tells the truth. He will be like a little fellow of  whom I heard once, whose mother told him that if he vent to play in a  bank from which the men had been drawing sand for a building, a bear  would come out and eat him up. One day another boy tried to coax him to  go there and play, but he said, no, he was afraid of the bears. The other  boy said there were no bears. \"But there be bears cause my mother said  there be bears.\" While they were disputing, the minister happened to  come along, and they asked him if there were bears in the sand-bank. He  told them there were none. \"But,\" said the first little boy, \"My mother  said there be bears there.\" \"I am sorry she said so,\" said the minister,  \"but the truth is, there are none.\" The child began to cry, and started  for home as fast as he could go. \"O Mama!\" he said, \"Did you tell me a  wrong story? Did you tell me there be bears down at the sand-bank when  there aren't any?\" She saw what a dreadful sin she had committed, and  she told him that she was sorry; but she was afraid that if he played  there he would get buried in the sand, and she told him that to keep him  away. \"But, Mama, it is such an awful thing to tell a wrong story.\" \"I  know it Tommy, I know it,\" she said, tears coming into her eyes; \"and  we will ask Jesus to forgive me and I will never do it again.\" They knelt  down, and she was just about to pray when he said, \"Wait, Mama, let me  ask Him; maybe you won't tell Him truly.\" That pierced her heart like a  dagger. She saw that her little boy had lost confidence in her truthfulness  even when she prayed.    --Jennie F. Willing        THE CHILD HEROINE OF NEW BRUNSWICK    We have read a touching incident about three little children, who, last  autumn late in the season, wandered alone in a dreary region of New  Brunswick. The sun had already sunk in the west and the gloom of evening  was spreading itself over the surrounding country.    The night came on fast; and feeling sure that they could not get home  before day break, the eldest (a girl of only six years) quietly placed  the two little ones in a sheltered nook on the sea-beach; and fearing  the cold chilly night for the younger children, Mary stripped off most  of her own clothes to keep them warm.    She then started off to gather dry sea-weed, and whatever else she could  find, to cover them with. Having tenderly in this way wrought for some  time to make them a nest, she at last fell down exhausted with the cold,  and half bare to the cold inclement night.    [Illustration]    That evening the loving father and tender mother sat up wondering at  their children's long absence; the hours dragged slowly past with anxious  watching and silent listening for the well-known little pattering feet.  In vain the fond parents' eyes pierced through the darkness. At length  they roused the neighbors with their anxious inquiries after their lost  ones. All that night was passed in searching and in tears, till early  in the morning, lying fast asleep and somewhat numbed with cold, were  found little Johnny and Lizzie. But oh! a touching spectacle lay near  them; their young savior was stiff, cold, and dead on the sea-weed which  the poor little child-heroine had not strength to drag into the nook,  where those she so deeply loved, and died to save, were sleeping. Thus  this little New Brunswick girl died in her successful and self-sacrificing  endeavor to save her brother and sister.    Does not this recall the love of the Lord Jesus Christ to you who read?  Mary went to the full extent of human love in dying for her little brother  and sister. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his  life for his friends.\" Yet the Lord Jesus laid down his life for his  enemies; for \"scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure  for a good man some would even dare to die; but God commendeth His love  toward us,\" etc. He makes no mistakes. Yet how many listen to this story  with more emotion and interest than they do to the story of the cross,  where the love of Jesus, the Son of God, is told in letters of blood!    --_Dawn of the Morning_        ANNIE AND VANIE'S FIRST REAL PRAYER    Two sisters, one about five years of age, the other one older, were  accustomed to go each Saturday morning, some distance from home, to get  chips and shavings from a cooper shop.    One morning with basket well filled, they were returning home when the  elder one was taken suddenly sick with cramps or cholera. She was in  great pain, and unable to proceed, much less to bear the basket home.  She sat down on the basket, and the younger one held her from falling.    The street was a lonely one occupied by workshops, factories, etc. Every  one was busy within; not a person was seen on the street.    The little girls were at a loss what to do. Too timid to go into any  workshop, they sat a while, as silent and quiet as the distressing pains  would allow.    Soon the elder girl said: \"You know, Annie, that a good while ago Mother  told us that if we ever got into trouble we should pray and, God would  help us. Now you help me to get down upon my knees, and hold me up, and  we will pray.\"    [Illustration]    There on the side-walk did these two little children ask God to send  some one to help them home.    The simple and brief prayer being ended, the sick girl was again helped  up, and sat on the basket,"]]]
