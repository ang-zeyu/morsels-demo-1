SCIENCE AND ART UNDER SOCIALISM  VIII.THE WORLD AS IT COULD BE MADE      INTRODUCTION      THE attempt to conceive imaginatively a better  ordering of human society than the destructive and  cruel chaos in which mankind has hitherto existed  is by no means modern: it is at least as old as Plato,  whose ``Republic'' set the model for the Utopias of  subsequent philosophers. Whoever contemplates the  world in the light of an ideal--whether what he seeks  be intellect, or art, or love, or simple happiness, or  all together--must feel a great sorrow in the evils  that men needlessly allow to continue, and--if he be  a man of force and vital energy--an urgent desire to  lead men to the realization of the good which inspires  his creative vision. It is this desire which has been  the primary force moving the pioneers of Socialism  and Anarchism, as it moved the inventors of ideal  commonwealths in the past. In this there is nothing  new. What is new in Socialism and Anarchism, is  that close relation of the ideal to the present  sufferings of men, which has enabled powerful political  movements to grow out of the hopes of solitary thinkers.  It is this that makes Socialism and Anarchism  important, and it is this that makes them dangerous  to those who batten, consciously or unconsciously  upon the evils of our present order of society.    The great majority of men and women, in ordinary  times, pass through life without ever contemplating  or criticising, as a whole, either their own  conditions or those of the world at large. They find  themselves born into a certain place in society, and  they accept what each day brings forth, without any  effort of thought beyond what the immediate present  requires. Almost as instinctively as the beasts of  the field, they seek the satisfaction of the needs of  the moment, without much forethought, and without  considering that by sufficient effort the whole  conditions of their lives could be changed. A certain  percentage, guided by personal ambition, make the effort  of thought and will which is necessary to place  themselves among the more fortunate members of the  community; but very few among these are seriously  concerned to secure for all the advantages which they  seek for themselves. It is only a few rare and exceptional  men who have that kind of love toward mankind  at large that makes them unable to endure  patiently the general mass of evil and suffering,  regardless of any relation it may have to their own  lives. These few, driven by sympathetic pain, will  seek, first in thought and then in action, for some  way of escape, some new system of society by which  life may become richer, more full of joy and less  full of preventable evils than it is at present. But  in the past such men have, as a rule, failed to interest  the very victims of the injustices which they wished  to remedy. The more unfortunate sections of the  population have been ignorant, apathetic from excess  of toil and weariness, timorous through the imminent  danger of immediate punishment by the holders of  power, and morally unreliable owing to the loss of  self-respect resulting from their degradation. To  create among such classes any conscious, deliberate  effort after general amelioration might have seemed  a hopeless task, and indeed in the past it has  generally proved so. But the modern world, by the  increase of education and the rise in the standard of  comfort among wage-earners, has produced new  conditions, more favorable than ever before to the  demand for radical reconstruction. It is above all  the Socialists, and in a lesser degree the Anarchists  (chiefly as the inspirers of Syndicalism), who have  become the exponents of this demand.    What is perhaps most remarkable in regard to  both Socialism and Anarchism is the association of a  widespread popular movement with ideals for a better  world. The ideals have been elaborated, in the  first instance, by solitary writers of books, and yet  powerful sections of the wage-earning classes have  accepted them as their guide in the practical affairs  of the world. In regard to Socialism this is evident;  but in regard to Anarchism it is only true with some  qualification. Anarchism as such has never been a  widespread creed, it is only in the modified form of  Syndicalism that it has achieved popularity. Unlike  Socialism and Anarchism, Syndicalism is primarily  the outcome, not of an idea, but of an organization:  the fact of Trade Union organization came first, and  the ideas of Syndicalism are those which seemed  appropriate to this organization in the opinion of  the more advanced French Trade Unions. But the  ideas are, in the main, derived from Anarchism, and  the men who gained acceptance for them were, for  the most part, Anarchists. Thus we may regard  Syndicalism as the Anarchism of the market-place  as opposed to the Anarchism of isolated individuals  which had preserved a precarious life throughout the  previous decades. Taking this view, we find in  Anarchist-Syndicalism the same combination of ideal  and organization as we find in Socialist political  parties. It is from this standpoint that our study  of these movements will be undertaken.    Socialism and Anarchism, in their modern form,  spring respectively from two protagonists, Marx and  Bakunin, who fought a lifelong battle, culminating  in a split in the first International. We shall begin  our study with these two men--first their teaching,  and then the organizations which they founded or  inspired. This will lead us to the spread of Socialism  in more recent years, and thence to the Syndicalist  revolt against Socialist emphasis on the State  and political action, and to certain movements outside  France which have some affinity with Syndicalism--  notably the I. W. W. in America and Guild  Socialism in England. From this historical survey  we shall pass to the consideration of some of the  more pressing problems of the future, and shall try  to decide in what respects the world would be happier  if the aims of Socialists or Syndicalists were  achieved.    My own opinion--which I may as well indicate  at the outset--is that pure Anarchism, though it  should be the ultimate ideal, to which society should  continually approximate, is for the present impossible,  and would not survive more than a year or two  at most if it were adopted. On the other hand, both  Marxian Socialism and Syndicalism, in spite of many  drawbacks, seem to me calculated to give rise to a  happier and better world than that in which we live.  I do not, however, regard either of them as the best  practicable system. Marxian Socialism, I fear,  would give far too much power to the State, while  Syndicalism, which aims at abolishing the State,  would, I believe, find itself forced to reconstruct a  central authority in order to put an end to the  rivalries of different groups of producers. The BEST  practicable system, to my mind, is that of Guild  Socialism, which concedes what is valid both in the  claims of the State Socialists and in the Syndicalist  fear of the State, by adopting a system of federalism  among trades for reasons similar to those which  are recommending federalism among nations. The  grounds for these conclusions will appear as we  proceed.    Before embarking upon the history of recent  movements In favor of radical reconstruction, it will  be worth while to consider some traits of character  which distinguish most political idealists, and are  much misunderstood by the general public for other  reasons besides mere prejudice. I wish to do full  justice to these reasons, in order to show the more  effectually why they ought not to be operative.    The leaders of the more advanced movements  are, in general, men of quite unusual disinterestedness,  as is evident from a consideration of their careers.  Although they have obviously quite as much ability  as many men who rise to positions of great power,  they do not themselves become the arbiters of  contemporary events, nor do they achieve wealth or the  applause of the mass of their contemporaries. Men  who have the capacity for winning these prizes, and  who work at least as hard as those who win them,  but deliberately adopt a line which makes the winning  of them impossible, must be judged to have an  aim in life other than personal advancement;  whatever admixture of self-seeking may enter into the  detail of their lives, their fundamental motive must  be outside Self. The pioneers of Socialism, Anarchism,  and Syndicalism have, for the most part,  experienced prison, exile, and poverty, deliberately  incurred because they would not abandon their  propaganda; and by this conduct they have shown that  the hope which inspired them was not for themselves,  but for mankind.    Nevertheless, though the desire for human welfare  is what at bottom determines the broad lines of such  men's lives, it often happens that, in the detail of  their speech and writing, hatred is far more visible  than love. The impatient idealist--and without some  impatience a man will hardly prove effective--is  almost sure to be led into hatred by the oppositions  and disappointments which he encounters in his  endeavors to bring happiness to the world. The more  certain he is of the purity of his motives and the truth  of his gospel, the more indignant he will become when  his teaching is rejected. Often he will successfully  achieve an attitude of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#1)"],[1,"WHITE FEATHER    By P. G.

It  is about time they got into form, as you say.\"    Clowes stared pensively into the fire.    \"They struck me,\" he said, \"as the sort of team who'd get into form  somewhere in the middle of the cricket season.\"    \"That's about it,\" said Allardyce. \"Try those biscuits, Trevor. They're  about the only good thing left in the place.\"    \"School isn't what it was?\" inquired Trevor, plunging a hand into the  tin that stood on the floor beside him.    \"No,\" said Allardyce, \"not only in footer but in everything. The place  seems absolutely rotten. It's bad enough losing all our matches, or  nearly all. Did you hear that Ripton took thirty-seven points off us  last term? And we only just managed to beat Greenburgh by a try to  nil.\"    \"We got thirty points last year,\" he went on. \"Thirty-three, and  forty-two the year before. Why, we've always simply walked them. It's  an understood thing that we smash them. And this year they held us all  the time, and it was only a fluke that we scored at all. Their back  miskicked, and let Barry in.\"    \"Barry struck me as the best of the outsides today,\" said Clowes. \"He's  heavier than he was, and faster.\"    \"He's all right,\" agreed Allardyce. \"If only the centres would feed  him, we might do something occasionally. But did you ever see such a  pair of rotters?\"    \"The man who was marking me certainly didn't seem particularly  brilliant. I don't even know his name. He didn't do anything at footer  in my time,\" said Trevor.    \"He's a chap called Attell. He wasn't here with you. He came after the  summer holidays. I believe he was sacked from somewhere. He's no good,  but there's nobody else. Colours have been simply a gift this year to  anyone who can do a thing. Only Barry and myself left from last year's  team. I never saw such a clearance as there was after the summer term.\"    \"Where are the boys of the Old Brigade?\" sighed Clowes.    \"I don't know. I wish they were here,\" said Allardyce.    Trevor and Clowes had come down, after the Easter term had been in  progress for a fortnight, to play for an Oxford A team against the  school. The match had resulted in an absurdly easy victory for the  visitors by over forty points. Clowes had scored five tries off his own  bat, and Trevor, if he had not fed his wing so conscientiously, would  probably have scored an equal number. As it was, he had got through  twice, and also dropped a goal. The two were now having a late tea with  Allardyce in his study. Allardyce had succeeded Trevor as Captain of  Football at Wrykyn, and had found the post anything but a sinecure.    For Wrykyn had fallen for the time being on evil days. It was  experiencing the reaction which so often takes place in a school in the  year following a season of exceptional athletic prosperity. With Trevor  as captain of football, both the Ripton matches had been won, and also  three out of the four other school matches. In cricket the eleven had  had an even finer record, winning all their school matches, and  likewise beating the M.C.C. and Old Wrykinians. It was too early to  prophesy concerning the fortunes of next term's cricket team, but, if  they were going to resemble the fifteen, Wrykyn was doomed to the worst  athletic year it had experienced for a decade.    \"It's a bit of a come-down after last season, isn't it?\" resumed  Allardyce, returning to his sorrows. It was a relief to him to discuss  his painful case without restraint.    \"We were a fine team last year,\" agreed Clowes, \"and especially strong  on the left wing. By the way, I see you've moved Barry across.\"    \"Yes. Attell can't pass much, but he passes better from right to left  than from left to right; so, Barry being our scoring man, I shifted him  across. The chap on the other wing, Stanning, isn't bad at times. Do  you remember him? He's in Appleby's. Then Drummond's useful at half.\"    \"Jolly useful,\" said Trevor. \"I thought he would be. I recommended you  last year to keep your eye on him.\"    \"Decent chap, Drummond,\" said Clowes.    \"About the only one there is left in the place,\" observed Allardyce  gloomily.    \"Our genial host,\" said Clowes, sawing at the cake, \"appears to have  that tired feeling. He seems to have lost that _joie de vivre_ of  his, what?\"    \"It must be pretty sickening,\" said Trevor sympathetically. \"I'm glad I  wasn't captain in a bad year.\"    \"The rummy thing is that the worse they are, the more side they stick  on. You see chaps who wouldn't have been in the third in a good year  walking about in first fifteen blazers, and first fifteen scarves, and  first fifteen stockings, and sweaters with first fifteen colours round  the edges. I wonder they don't tattoo their faces with first fifteen  colours.\"    \"It would improve some of them,\" said Clowes.    Allardyce resumed his melancholy remarks. \"But, as I was saying, it's  not only that the footer's rotten. That you can't help, I suppose. It's  the general beastliness of things that I bar. Rows with the town, for  instance. We've been having them on and off ever since you left. And  it'll be worse now, because there's an election coming off soon. Are  you fellows stopping for the night in the town? If so, I should advise  you to look out for yourselves.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Clowes. \"I shouldn't like to see Trevor sand-bagged. Nor  indeed, should I--for choice--care to be sand-bagged myself. But, as it  happens, the good Donaldson is putting us up, so we escape the perils  of the town.    \"Everybody seems so beastly slack now,\" continued Allardyce. \"It's  considered the thing. You're looked on as an awful blood if you say you  haven't done a stroke of work for a week. I shouldn't mind that so much  if they were some good at anything. But they can't do a thing. The  footer's rotten, the gymnasium six is made up of kids an inch high--we  shall probably be about ninetieth at the Public Schools'  Competition--and there isn't any one who can play racquets for nuts.  The only thing that Wrykyn'll do this year is to get the Light-Weights  at Aldershot. Drummond ought to manage that. He won the Feathers last  time. He's nearly a stone heavier now, and awfully good. But he's the  only man we shall send up, I expect. Now that O'Hara and Moriarty are  both gone, he's the only chap we have who's up to Aldershot form. And  nobody else'll take the trouble to practice. They're all too slack.\"    \"In fact,\" said Clowes, getting up, \"as was only to be expected, the  school started going to the dogs directly I left. We shall have to be  pushing on now, Allardyce. We promised to look in on Seymour before we  went to bed. Friend let us away.\"    \"Good night,\" said Allardyce.    \"What you want,\" said Clowes solemnly, \"is a liver pill. You are  looking on life too gloomily. Take a pill. Let there be no stint. Take  two. Then we shall hear your merry laugh ringing through the old  cloisters once more. Buck up and be a bright and happy lad, Allardyce.\"    \"Take more than a pill to make me that,\" growled that soured  footballer.    Mr Seymour's views on the school resembled those of Allardyce. Wrykyn,  in his opinion, was suffering from a reaction.    \"It's always the same,\" he said, \"after a very good year. Boys leave,  and it's hard to fill their places. I must say I did not expect quite  such a clearing out after the summer. We have had bad luck in that way.  Maurice, for instance, and Robinson both ought to have had another year  at school. It was quite unexpected, their leaving. They would have made  all the difference to the forwards. You must have somebody to lead the  pack who has had a little experience of first fifteen matches.\"    \"But even then,\" said Clowes, \"they oughtn't to be so rank as they were  this afternoon. They seemed such slackers.\"    \"I'm afraid that's the failing of the school just now,\" agreed Mr  Seymour. \"They don't play themselves out. They don't put just that last  ounce into their work which makes all the difference.\"    Clowes thought of saying that, to judge by appearances, they did not  put in even the first ounce; but refrained. However low an opinion a  games' master may have--and even express--of his"]]]
