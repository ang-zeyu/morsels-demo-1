[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4552"],[0,"The Border Legion (#1)"],[1,"BORDER LEGION    By Zane Grey          1    Joan Randle reined in her horse on the crest of the cedar ridge, and  with remorse and dread beginning to knock at her heart she gazed before  her at the wild and looming mountain range.    \"Jim wasn't fooling me,\" she said. \"He meant it. He's going straight for  the border... Oh, why did I taunt him!\"    It was indeed a wild place, that southern border of Idaho, and that year  was to see the ushering in of the wildest time probably ever known  in the West. The rush for gold had peopled California with a horde of  lawless men of every kind and class. And the vigilantes and then the  rich strikes in Idaho had caused a reflux of that dark tide of humanity.  Strange tales of blood and gold drifted into the camps, and prospectors  and hunters met with many unknown men.    Joan had quarreled with Jim Cleve, and she was bitterly regretting it.  Joan was twenty years old, tall, strong, dark. She had been born in  Missouri, where her father had been well-to-do and prominent, until,  like many another man of his day, he had impeded the passage of a  bullet. Then Joan had become the protegee of an uncle who had responded  to the call of gold; and the latter part of her life had been spent in  the wilds.    She had followed Jim's trail for miles out toward the range. And now she  dismounted to see if his tracks were as fresh as she had believed. He  had left the little village camp about sunrise. Someone had seen him  riding away and had told Joan. Then he had tarried on the way, for it  was now midday. Joan pondered. She had become used to his idle threats  and disgusted with his vacillations. That had been the trouble--Jim  was amiable, lovable, but since meeting Joan he had not exhibited any  strength of character. Joan stood beside her horse and looked away  toward the dark mountains. She was daring, resourceful, used to horses  and trails and taking care of herself; and she did not need anyone to  tell her that she had gone far enough. It had been her hope to come up  with Jim. Always he had been repentant. But this time was different. She  recalled his lean, pale face--so pale that freckles she did not know he  had showed through--and his eyes, usually so soft and mild, had glinted  like steel. Yes, it had been a bitter, reckless face. What had she said  to him? She tried to recall it.    The night before at twilight Joan had waited for him. She had given  him precedence over the few other young men of the village, a fact she  resentfully believed he did not appreciate. Jim was unsatisfactory in  every way except in the way he cared for her. And that also--for he  cared too much.    When Joan thought how Jim loved her, all the details of that night  became vivid. She sat alone under the spruce-trees near the cabin. The  shadows thickened, and then lightened under a rising moon. She heard the  low hum of insects, a distant laugh of some woman of the village, and  the murmur of the brook. Jim was later than usual. Very likely, as  her uncle had hinted, Jim had tarried at the saloon that had lately  disrupted the peace of the village. The village was growing, and  Joan did not like the change. There were too many strangers, rough,  loud-voiced, drinking men. Once it had been a pleasure to go to the  village store; now it was an ordeal. Somehow Jim had seemed to be  unfavorably influenced by these new conditions. Still, he had never  amounted to much. Her resentment, or some feeling she had, was reaching  a climax. She got up from her seat. She would not wait any longer for  him, and when she did see him it would be to tell him a few blunt facts.    Just then there was a slight rustle behind her. Before she could turn  someone seized her in powerful arms. She was bent backward in a bearish  embrace, so that she could neither struggle nor cry out. A dark face  loomed over hers--came closer. Swift kisses closed her eyes, burned her  cheeks, and ended passionately on her lips. They had some strange power  over her. Then she was released.    Joan staggered back, frightened, outraged. She was so dazed she did not  recognize the man, if indeed she knew him. But a laugh betrayed him. It  was Jim.    \"You thought I had no nerve,\" he said. \"What do you think of that?\"    Suddenly Joan was blindly furious. She could have killed him. She had  never given him any right, never made him any promise, never let him  believe she cared. And he had dared--! The hot blood boiled in her  cheeks. She was furious with him, but intolerably so with herself,  because somehow those kisses she had resented gave her unknown pain  and shame. They had sent a shock through all her being. She thought she  hated him.    \"You--you--\" she broke out. \"Jim Cleve, that ends you with me!\"    \"Reckon I never had a beginning with you,\" he replied, bitterly. \"It was  worth a good deal... I'm not sorry... By Heaven--I've--kissed you!\"    He breathed heavily. She could see how pale he had grown in the shadowy  moonlight. She sensed a difference in him--a cool, reckless defiance.    \"You'll be sorry,\" she said. \"I'll have nothing to do with you any  more.\"    \"All right. But I'm not, and I won't be sorry.\"    She wondered whether he had fallen under the influence of drink. Jim  had never cared for liquor, which virtue was about the only one he  possessed. Remembering his kisses, she knew he had not been drinking.  There was a strangeness about him, though, that she could not fathom.  Had he guessed his kisses would have that power? If he dared again--!  She trembled, and it was not only rage. But she would teach him a  lesson.    \"Joan, I kissed you because I can't be a hangdog any longer,\" he said.  \"I love you and I'm no good without you. You must care a little for me.  Let's marry... I'll--\"    \"Never!\" she replied, like flint. \"You're no good at all.\"    \"But I am,\" he protested, with passion. \"I used to do things. But  since--since I've met you I've lost my nerve. I'm crazy for you. You  let the other men run after you. Some of them aren't fit to--to--Oh, I'm  sick all the time! Now it's longing and then it's jealousy. Give me a  chance, Joan.\"    \"Why?\" she queried, coldly. \"Why should I? You're shiftless. You won't  work. When you do find a little gold you squander it. You have nothing  but a gun. You can't do anything but shoot.\"    \"Maybe that'll come in handy,\" he said, lightly.    \"Jim Cleve, you haven't it in you even to be BAD,\" she went on,  stingingly.    At that he made a violent gesture. Then he loomed over her. \"Joan  Handle, do you mean that?\" he asked.    \"I surely do,\" she responded. At last she had struck fire from him. The  fact was interesting. It lessened her anger.    \"Then I'm so low, so worthless, so spineless that I can't even be bad?\"    \"Yes, you are.\"    \"That's what you think of me--after I've ruined myself for love of you?\"    She laughed tauntingly. How strange and hot a glee she felt in hurting  him!    \"By God, I'll show you!\" he cried, hoarsely.    \"What will you do, Jim?\" she asked, mockingly.    \"I'll shake this camp. I'll rustle for the border. I'll get in with  Kells and Gulden... You'll hear of me, Joan Randle!\"    These were names of strange, unknown, and wild men of a growing and  terrible legion on the border. Out there, somewhere, lived desperados,  robbers, road-agents, murderers. More and more rumor had brought tidings  of them into the once quiet village. Joan felt a slight cold sinking  sensation at her heart. But this was only a magnificent threat of Jim's.  He could not do such a thing. She would never let him, even if he could.  But after the incomprehensible manner of woman, she did not tell him  that.    \"Bah! You haven't the nerve!\" she retorted, with another mocking laugh.    Haggard and fierce, he glared down at her a moment, and then without  another word he strode away. Joan was amazed, and a little sick, a  little uncertain: still she did not call him back.    And now at noon of the next day she had tracked him miles toward the  mountains. It was a broad trail he had taken, one used by prospectors  and hunters. There was no danger of her getting lost. What risk she  ran was of meeting some of these border ruffians that had of late been  frequent visitors in the village. Presently she mounted again and rode  down the ridge. She would go a mile or so farther.    Behind every rock and cedar she expected to find Jim. Surely he had only  threatened her. But she had taunted him in a way no man could stand, and  if there were any strength of character in him he would show it now. Her  remorse and dread increased. After all, he was only a boy--only a couple  of years older than she was. Under stress of feeling he might go to any  extreme. Had she misjudged him? If she had not, she had at least been  brutal. But he had dared to kiss her! Every time she thought of that  a tingling, a confusion, a hot shame went over her. And at length Joan  marveled to find that out of the affront to her pride, and the quarrel,  and the fact of his going and of her following, and especially out of  this increasing remorseful dread, there had flourished up a strange and  reluctant respect for Jim Cleve.    She climbed another ridge and halted again. This time she saw a horse  and rider down in the green. Her heart leaped. It must be Jim returning.  After all, then, he had only threatened. She felt relieved and glad, yet  vaguely sorry. She had been right in her conviction.    She had not watched long, however, before she saw that this was not the  horse Jim usually rode. She took the precaution then to hide behind some  bushes, and watched from there. When the horseman approached closer  she discerned that instead of Jim it was Harvey Roberts, a man of the  village and a good friend of her uncle's. Therefore she rode out of her  covert and hailed him. It was a significant thing that at the sound  of her voice Roberts started suddenly and reached for his gun. Then he  recognized her."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net  (This file was produced from images generously made  available by the Digital & Multimedia Center, Michigan  State University Libraries.)

It is, perhaps, not without interest, in publishing the second volume of  the History of Julius Caesar, written by the Emperor Napoleon III., to  call to memory the names of Sovereigns and Princes who have employed  themselves upon the same subject.    _The King of France, Charles VIII._, showed an especial admiration for  the _Commentaries_ of Caesar, and the celebrated monk, Robert Gaguin,  presented to him, in 1480, the translation he had made in French of the  eight books of the War in Gaul. We are informed of this in the edition  of the _translation_ by the learned monk, printed in 1500. This edition,  in large 4to, is from the press of Antoine Verard. (See J. Ch. Brunet,  _Manuel du Libraire et de l'Amateur de Livres_, fourth edition, tom. I.,  p. 518, and the _Biographie Universelle_, article _Charles VIII._)    _Charles V._, who professed a great admiration for Caesar, left a copy of  the _Commentaries_ filled with marginal notes, written with his own  hand. It was at his instigation that the Viceroy of Sicily, Ferdinand  Gonzaga, sent a scientific mission into France to study Caesar's  campaigns on the localities. The forty plans which were made by the  members of this commission, and among which that of Alise is found, were  published in 1575, in the edition of James Strada.    _The Sultan Soliman II._, contemporary of Charles V., whom he had taken  for his model, sent through all Europe to procure as many copies of  Caesar's _Commentaries_ as could be found, which he ordered to be  collated, and caused a translation to be made into the Turkish language  for his own daily reading.    _The King of France, Henri IV._, translated the two first books of  Caesar's _Commentaries_. The manuscript of this translation was deposited  in the Bibliotheque du Roi, and M. des Noyers took it thence to deliver  it to Louis XIII., who, in his turn, translated the two last books of  the _Commentaries_. These two translations were joined together, and  printed at the Louvre in 1630.    _Louis XIV._ translated the first book of the _Commentaries_. His  translation was printed at Paris in 1651, in folio, with figures. This  work has not been reprinted; it is now very rare. The reader may consult  on this subject the _Methode d'etudier l'Histoire_ of the Abbe  Lenglet-Dufresnoy, tom. II., p. 481; and J. Ch. Brunet, _Manuel du  Libraire et de l'Amateur de Livres_, fourth edition, tom. I., p. 519.    _The great Conde_, who had studied with care the campaigns of Caesar,  encouraged the translation of the _Commentaries_ undertaken by Nicolas  Perrot d'Ablancourt; it was the translation most esteemed and the most  in vogue during the last century.    _Christina, Queen of Sweden_, had composed _Reflections on the Life and  Actions of Caesar_, as we are informed by J. Arckenholz in his work  entitled _Memoires concernant Christine, Reine de Suede_, Amsterdam,  1751-1760, tom. IV., No. 6, p. 4.    _Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orleans_, surnamed _Egalite_, was a great  reader of the _Commentaries_. He caused a map of Caesar's campaigns in  Gaul to be made.    Lastly, _the Emperor Napoleon I._, at St. Helena, dictated a _Precis des  Guerres de Cesar_ to Comte Marchand, who published it in Paris in 1836,  in 8vo.          CONTENTS.    BOOK III.
