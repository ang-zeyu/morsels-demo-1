How's  _People  of  Africa_  was  produced  by John Walker in January 2003.  It follows the 1921 edition  (the only one of which I am aware) published in London by the  Society  for  Promoting  Christian  Knowledge  and in New York by the Macmillan  Company.  I have corrected two typographical errors  in  the  original  text: \"sandstorm\" was misspelled as \"standstorm\" on page 21 (section 1  of chapter III), and \"bought\" appeared where \"brought\" was intended on  page 33 (paragraph 3 of section 2 of chapter IV).    ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              PEOPLE OF AFRICA                          Etext Production Notes    This  public  domain  Etext edition of Edith A. How's People of Africa  was prepared by:            John Walker          http://www.fourmilab.ch/    If  you discover any errors in this Etext, please report them to me by  E-mail.  If you're reporting a discrepancy between  the  Etext  and  a  modern  edition,  please  include  a complete citation of your source.  Upon  close  examination,  most  editions  contain  minor  errors  and  discrepancies which I've tried to correct in this Etext.  These Etexts  are part of the intellectual heritage we share as humans--please  help  to make them _perfectly embody_ the authors' legacies to the thousands  of generations and billions of readers whose lives they will enrich.                          Beautifully Typeset Etexts                        --------------------------    Free Plain Vanilla Etexts don't have to be austere and typographically  uninviting.  Most literature (as opposed to  scientific  publications,  for   example),   is   typographically  simple  and  can  be  rendered  beautifully into  type  without  encoding  it  into  proprietary  word  processor file formats or impenetrable markup languages.    This Etext is encoded in a form which  permits  it  to  be  both  read  directly   (Plain   Vanilla)   and   typeset   in   a  form  virtually  indistinguishable from printed editions of the work.    To create \"typographically friendly\" Etexts, I adhere to the following  rules:        1.  Characters  follow the 8-bit ISO 8859/1 Latin-1 character set.          ASCII is a proper subset of this character set, so any  \"Plain          ASCII\"  file meets ths criterion by definition.  The extension          to ISO 8859/1 is required so that  Etexts  which  include  the          accented  characters  used  by  Western European languages may          continue to be \"readable by both humans and computers\".        2.  No  white  space  characters  other  than  blanks   and   line          separators  are  used  (in  particular,  tabs  are expanded to          spaces).        3.  The text bracket sequence:    <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>          appears  both  before  and after the actual body of the Etext.          This allows including an arbitrary prologue  and  epilogue  to          the body of the document.        4.  Normal body text begins in column 1 and is  set  ragged  right          with  a  line  length  of  70  characters.   The  choice of 70          characters is arbitrary and was made to avoid overly long  and          therefore less readable lines in the Plain Vanilla text.        5.  Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.        6.  Centring,  right,  and  left  justification  is  indicated  by          actually so-justifying the text within the 70 character  line.          Left  justified  lines  should  start  in  column  2  to avoid          confusion with paragraph body text.        7.  Block  quotations  are  indented to start  in column 5 and set          ragged right with a line length of 60 characters.        8.  Preformatted tables begin with a line which starts in column 3          and  contains at  least one  sequence of three  or more spaces          between nonblanks.   The table is formatted verbatim until the          next blank line.        9.  Text set in italics is  bracketed  by  underscore  characters,          \"_\".  These must match.       10.  Footnotes  are  included  in-line,  bracketed  by  \"[]\".   The          footnote appears at the point in the copy where  the  footnote          mark  appears in the source text.  Footnotes may not be nested          and may consist of only a single paragraph.       11.  The  title  is  defined  as the sequence of lines which appear          between the first text bracket \"<><><>...\" and a centred  line          consisting exclusively of more than two equal signs \"====\".       12.  The  author's name is the text which follows the line of equal          signs marking the end of the  title  and  precedes  the  first          chapter mark.  This may be multiple lines.       13.  Chapters  are  delimited  by  a three line sequence of centred          lines:                             <Chapter number>                           --------------------                              <Chapter name>          The line of minus signs must be centred and contain  three  or          more  minus  signs  and  no  other characters apart from white          space.  Chapter \"numbers\" need not be numeric--they can be any          text.       14.  Dashes in the text are indicated  in  the  normal  typewritten          text  convention  of \"--\".  No hyphenation of words at the end          of lines is done.       15.  Ellipses are indicated by \"...\"; sentence-ending  ellipses  by          \"....\".       16.  Greek  letters  and  mathematical  symbols are enclosed in the          brackets \"\\(\" and \"\\)\" and are expressed as their character or          symbol  names in the LaTeX typesetting language.  For example,          write the Greek word for \"word\" as:                    \\( \\lambda \\acute{o} \\gamma o \\varsigma \\)            and the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation as:                    \\( x_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)            I  acknowledge that this provision is controversial.  It is as          distasteful to me as I suspect it is to you.  In its  defence,          let   me  treat  the  Greek  letter  and  math  formula  cases          separately.  Using LaTeX encoding for Greek letters is  purely          a  stopgap  until  Unicode  comes  into  common  use on enough          computers so that we can  use  it  for  Etexts  which  contain          characters  not in the ASCII or ISO 8859/1 sets (which are the          7- and 8-bit subsets of Unicode, respectively).  If an  author          uses  a Greek word in the text, we have two ways to proceed in          attempting to meet the condition:                 The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and               does *not* contain characters other than those               intended by the author of the work, although....            The first approach is to transliterate into  Roman  characters          according  to  a  standard  table  such  as that given in _The          Chicago Manual of  Style_.   This  preserves  readability  and          doesn't  require  funny  encoding, but in a sense violates the          author's   \"original   intent\"--the    author    could    have          transliterated  the  word in the first place but chose not to.          By transliterating we're reversing the author's decision.  The          second  approach,  encoding  in  LaTeX  or  some  other markup          language, preserves the distinction that the author wrote  the          word  in  Greek  and  maintains  readability since letters are          called out by their English language names, for the most part.          Of  course LaTeX helps us only for Greek (and a few characters          from other languages).  If you're faced with Cyrillic, Arabic,          Chinese,  Japanese,  or  other  languages written in non-Roman          letters, the only option (absent Unicode) is to transliterate.            I   suggest  that  encoding  mathematical  formulas  as  LaTeX          achieves the goal of \"readable by humans\" on the  strength  of          LaTeX   encoding   being   widely  used  in  the  physics  and          mathematics communities when writing formulas  in  E-mail  and          other  ASCII  media.   Just as one is free to to transliterate          Greek in an Etext, one can use ASCII artwork formulas like:                                              ---------                                       +   /  2                                    -b - \\/  b  - 4ac                          x     =  ------------------                           1,2            2a            This is probably  a  better  choice  for  occasional  formulas          simple enough to write out this way.  But to produce Etexts of          historic  scientific  publications  such  as  Einstein's  \"Zur          Elektrodynamik  bewegter KÂ”rper\" (the special relativity paper          published in _Annalen der Physik_ in 1905), trying  to  render          dozens of complicated equations in ASCII is not only extremely          tedious  but in all likelihood counter-productive; ambiguities          in trying to express complex equations would make it difficult          for a reader to determine precisely what Einstein wrote unless          conventions just as complicated (and harder to learn) as those          of  LaTeX  were  adopted  for ASCII expression of mathematics.          Finally, the choice of LaTeX encoding is made not  only  based          on  its  existing  widespread  use  but because the underlying          software that defines it (TeX and LaTeX) are entirely  in  the          public  domain,  available in source code form, implemented on          most commonly-available computers, and frozen by their authors          so  that,  unlike  many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images  generously made available by The Internet Archive)                [Illustration: Richmond, Del.

[Illustration: Handwritten letter]    It seems but fitting, that I should preface this story of my life with  a few notes of instruction.    The desire to leave behind me some recollections of my life, has  been cherished by me, for many years past; but failing strength or  increasing infirmities have prevented its accomplishment.    At my suggestion and with what assistance I have been able to render,  my son, Ross Charles Edward Stowe, has compiled from my letters and  journals, this biography. It is this true story of my life, told for  the most part, in my own words and has therefore all the force of an  autobiography.    It is perhaps much more accurate as to detail & impression than is  possible with any autobiography, written later in life.    If these pages, shall help those who read them to a firmer trust in God  & a deeper sense of His fatherly goodness throughout the days of our  earthly pilgrimage I can say with Valiant for Truth in the Pilgrim's  Progress!    I am going to my Father's & tho with great difficulty, I am got  thither, get now, I do not repent me of all the troubles I have been  at, to arrive where I am.    My sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage & my  courage & skill to him that can get it.
