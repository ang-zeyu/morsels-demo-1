They afforded a sharp  contrast. One was a thick-set and rather ruffianly looking fellow, not  too cleanly in either person or clothing, and, amongst other evidences  that at one time he had known the prize ring, possessing a badly broken  nose. His companion was dressed with that spruceness which belongs to  the successful East End Jew; he was cleanly shaven, of slight build, and  alert in manner and address.    Having ordered and paid for two whiskies and sodas, the Jew, raising  his glass, nodded to his companion and took a drink. The glitter of  a magnificent diamond which he wore seemed to attract the other's  attention almost hypnotically.    \"Cheerio, Freddy!\" said the thick-set man. \"Any news?\"    \"Nothing much,\" returned the one addressed as Freddy, setting his glass  upon the table and selecting a cigarette from a packet which he carried  in his pocket.    \"I'm not so sure,\" growled the other, watching him suspiciously. \"You've  been lying low for a long time, and it's not like you to slack off  except when there's something big in sight.\"    \"Hm!\" said his companion, lighting his cigarette. \"What do you mean  exactly?\"    Jim Poland--for such was the big man's name--growled and spat  reflectively into a spittoon.    \"I've had my eye on you, Freddy,\" he replied; \"I've had my eye on you!\"    \"Oh, have you?\" murmured the other. \"But tell me what you mean!\"    Beneath his suave manner lay a threat, and, indeed, Freddy Cohen, known  to his associates as \"Diamond Fred,\" was in many ways a formidable  personality. He had brought to his chosen profession of crook a  first-rate American training, together with all that mental agility and  cleverness which belong to his race, and was at once an object of envy  and admiration amongst the fraternity which keeps Scotland Yard busy.    Jim Poland, physically a more dangerous character, was not in the same  class with him; but he was not without brains of a sort, and Cohen,  although smiling agreeably, waited with some anxiety for his reply.    \"I mean,\" growled Poland, \"that you're not wasting your time with Lala  Huang for nothing.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" returned Cohen lightly. \"She's a pretty girl; but what  business is it of yours?\"    \"None at all. I ain't interested in 'er good looks; neither are you.\"    Cohen shrugged and raised his glass again.    \"Come on,\" growled Poland, leaning across the table. \"I know, and I'm in  on it. D'ye hear me? I'm in on it. These are hard times, and we've got  to stick together.\"    \"Oh,\" said Cohen, \"that's the game, is it?\"    \"That's the game right enough. You won't go wrong if you bring me in,  even at fifty-fifty, because maybe I know things about old Huang that  you don't know.\"    The Jew's expression changed subtly, and beneath his drooping lids he  glanced aside at the speaker. Then:    \"It's no promise,\" he said, \"but what do you know?\"    Poland bent farther over the table.    \"Chinatown's being watched again. I heard this morning that Red Kerry  was down here.\"    Cohen laughed.    \"Red Kerry!\" he echoed. \"Red Kerry means nothing in my young life, Jim.\"    \"Don't 'e?\" returned Jim, snarling viciously. \"The way he cleaned up  that dope crowd awhile back seemed to show he was no jug, didn't it?\"    The Jew made a facial gesture as if to dismiss the subject.    \"All right,\" continued Poland. \"Think that way if you like. But the  patrols have been doubled. I suppose you know that? And it's a cert  there are special men on duty, ever since the death of that Chink.\"    Cohen shifted uneasily, glancing about him in a furtive fashion.    \"See what I mean?\" continued the other. \"Chinatown ain't healthy just  now.\"    He finished his whisky at a draught, and, standing up, lurched heavily  across to the counter. He returned with two more glasses. Then,  reseating himself and bending forward again:    \"There's one thing I reckon you don't know,\" he whispered in Cohen's  ear. \"I saw that Chink talking to Lala Huang only a week before the time  he was hauled out of Limehouse Reach. I'm wondering, Diamond, if, with  all your cleverness, you may not go the same way.\"    \"Don't try to pull the creep stuff on me, Jim,\" said Cohen uneasily.  \"What are you driving at, anyway?\"    \"Well,\" replied Poland, sipping his whisky reflectively, \"how did that  Chink get into the river?\"    \"How the devil do I know?\"    \"And what killed him? It wasn't drowning, although he was all swelled  up.\"    \"See here, old pal,\" said Cohen. \"I know 'Frisco better than you know  Limehouse. Let me tell you that this little old Chinatown of yours is  pie to me. You're trying to get me figuring on Chinese death traps,  secret poisons, and all that junk. Boy, you're wasting your poetry.  Even if you did see the Chink with Lala, and I doubt it--Oh, don't  get excited, I'm speaking plain--there's no connection that I can see  between the death of said Chink and old Huang Chow.\"    \"Ain't there?\" growled Poland huskily. He grasped the other's wrist as  in a vise and bent forward so that his battered face was close to the  pale countenance of the Jew. \"I've been covering old Huang for months  and months. Now I'm going to tell you something. Since the death of that  Chink Red Kerry's been covering him, too.\"    \"See here!\" Cohen withdrew his arm from the other's grasp angrily. \"You  can't freeze me out of this claim with bogey stuff. You're listed, my  lad, and you know it. Chief Inspector Kerry is your pet nightmare.  But if he walked in here right now I could ask him to have a drink. I  wouldn't but I could. You've got the wrong angle, Jim. Lala likes me  fine, and although she doesn't say much, what she does say is straight.  I'll ask her to-night about the Chink.\"    \"Then you'll be a damned fool.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"I say you'll be a damned fool. I'm warning you, Freddy. There are  Chinks and Chinks. All the boys know old Huang Chow has got a regular  gold mine buried somewhere under the floor. But all the boys don't know  what I know, and it seems that you don't either.\"    \"What is that?\"    Jim Poland bent forward more urgently, again seizing Cohen's wrist, and:    \"Huang Chow is a mighty big bug amongst the Chinese,\" he whispered,  glancing cautiously about him. \"He's hellish clever and rotten with  money. A man like that wants handling. I'm not telling you what I know.  But call it fifty-fifty and maybe you'll come out alive.\"    The brow of Diamond Fred displayed beads of perspiration, and with  a blue silk handkerchief which he carried in his breast pocket he  delicately dried his forehead.    \"You're an old hand at this stuff, Jim,\" he muttered. \"It amounts to  this, I suppose; that if I don't agree you'll queer my game?\"    Jim Poland's brow lowered and he clenched his fists formidably. Then:    \"Listen,\" he said in his hoarse voice. \"It ain't your claim any more  than mine. You've covered it different, that's all. Yours was always the  petticoat lay. Mine's slower but safer. Is anyone else in with you?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then we'll double up. Now I'll tell you something. I was backing out.\"    \"What? You were going to quit?\"    \"I was.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because the thing's too dead easy, and a thing like that always looks  like hell to me.\"    Freddy Cohen finished his glass of whisky.    \"Wait while I get some more drinks,\" he said.    In this way, then, at about the hour of ten on a stuffy autumn night, in  the crowded bar of that Wapping public-house, these two made a  compact; and of its outcome and of the next appearance of Cohen, the  Jewish-American cracksman, within the ken of man, I shall now proceed to  tell.          II    THE END OF COHEN        \"I've been expecting this,\" said Chief Inspector Kerry. He tilted his  bowler hat farther forward over his brow and contemplated the ghastly  exhibit which lay upon the slab of the mortuary. Two other police  officers--one in uniform--were present, and they treated the celebrated  Chief Inspector with the deference which he had not only earned but had  always demanded from his subordinates.    Earmarked for important promotion, he was an interesting figure as  he stood there in the gloomy, ill-lighted place, his pose that of an  athlete about to perform a long jump, or perhaps, as it might have  appeared to some, that of a dancing-master about to demonstrate a new  step.    His close-cropped hair was brilliantly red, and so was his short, wiry,  aggressive moustache. He was ruddy of complexion, and he looked out  unblinkingly upon the world with a pair of steel-blue eyes. Neat he  was to spruceness, and while of no more than medium height he had the  shoulders of an acrobat.    The detective who stood beside him, by name John Durham, had one trait  in common with his celebrated superior. This was a quick keenness, a  sort of alert vitality, which showed in his eyes, and indeed in every  line of his thin, clean-shaven face. Kerry had picked him out as the  most promising junior in his department.    \"Give me the particulars,\" said the Chief Inspector. \"It isn't robbery.  He's wearing a diamond ring worth two hundred pounds.\"    His diction was rapid and terse--so rapid as to create the impression  that he bit off the ends of the longer words. He turned his fierce blue  eyes upon the uniformed officer who stood at the end of the slab.    \"They are very few, Chief Inspector,\" was the reply. \"He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#1)"],[1,"search for information on a specific country from the list below,  search for @country:  @Afganistan, for example.

The Trust  Territory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of  Palau. The gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now  presented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the  old exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on Age structure and the  Airports entry now includes unpaved runways. The Communications  category has been restructured and now includes the entries of  Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries  in the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland  waterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be  found under a new category called Transportation. There is a new  appendix listing estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange  rate basis for all nations. A reference map of the Republic of South  Africa is included. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook  have been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of  some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes  will occur in the 1996 Factbook.
