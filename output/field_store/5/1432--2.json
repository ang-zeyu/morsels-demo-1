Clemens)                               Part 6.        CHAPTER XXVII    THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO    About bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his  hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear.  The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but  hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around, whereas the  lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves  were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth.  So I inverted  a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it.  I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only  about a half-inch long; and tried to do it inartistically, and  succeeded.  It was a villainous disfigurement.  When he got his  lubberly sandals on, and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth,  which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he was no  longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, but one of the unhandsomest  and most commonplace and unattractive.  We were dressed and barbered  alike, and could pass for small farmers, or farm bailiffs, or  shepherds, or carters; yes, or for village artisans, if we chose,  our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of  its strength and cheapness.  I don't mean that it was really cheap  to a very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest  material there was for male attire--manufactured material, you  understand.    We slipped away an hour before dawn, and by broad sun-up had made  eight or ten miles, and were in the midst of a sparsely settled  country.  I had a pretty heavy knapsack; it was laden with  provisions--provisions for the king to taper down on, till he  could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage.    I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside, and then  gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with.  Then I said  I would find some water for him, and strolled away.  Part of my  project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little  myself.  It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence;  even at the council board, except upon those rare occasions when  the sitting was a very long one, extending over hours; then I had  a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert  and was as comfortable as the toothache.  I didn't want to break  him in suddenly, but do it by degrees.  We should have to sit  together now when in company, or people would notice; but it would  not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when  there was no necessity for it.    I found the water some three hundred yards away, and had been  resting about twenty minutes, when I heard voices.  That is all  right, I thought--peasants going to work; nobody else likely to be  stirring this early.  But the next moment these comers jingled into  sight around a turn of the road--smartly clad people of quality,  with luggage-mules and servants in their train!  I was off like  a shot, through the bushes, by the shortest cut.  For a while it  did seem that these people would pass the king before I could  get to him; but desperation gives you wings, you know, and I canted  my body forward, inflated my breast, and held my breath and flew.  I arrived.  And in plenty good enough time, too.    \"Pardon, my king, but it's no time for ceremony--jump!  Jump to  your feet--some quality are coming!\"    \"Is that a marvel?  Let them come.\"    \"But my liege!  You must not be seen sitting.  Rise!--and stand in  humble posture while they pass.  You are a peasant, you know.\"    \"True--I had forgot it, so lost was I in planning of a huge war  with Gaul\"--he was up by this time, but a farm could have got up  quicker, if there was any kind of a boom in real estate--\"and  right-so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream  the which--\"    \"A humbler attitude, my lord the king--and quick!  Duck your head!  --more!--still more!--droop it!\"    He did his honest best, but lord, it was no great things.  He looked  as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa.  It is the most you could  say of it.  Indeed, it was such a thundering poor success that  it raised wondering scowls all along the line, and a gorgeous  flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip; but I jumped in  time and was under it when it fell; and under cover of the volley  of coarse laughter which followed, I spoke up sharply and warned  the king to take no notice.  He mastered himself for the moment,  but it was a sore tax; he wanted to eat up the procession.  I said:    \"It would end our adventures at the very start; and we, being  without weapons, could do nothing with that armed gang.  If we  are going to succeed in our emprise, we must not only look the  peasant but act the peasant.\"    \"It is wisdom; none can gainsay it.  Let us go on, Sir Boss.  I will take note and learn, and do the best I may.\"    He kept his word.  He did the best he could, but I've seen better.  If you have ever seen an active, heedless, enterprising child  going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day  long, and an anxious mother at its heels all the while, and just  saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with  each new experiment, you've seen the king and me.    If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like,  I should have said, No, if anybody wants to make his living  exhibiting a king as a peasant, let him take the layout; I can  do better with a menagerie, and last longer.  And yet, during  the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other  dwelling.  If he could pass muster anywhere during his early  novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road; so to these  places we confined ourselves.  Yes, he certainly did the best he  could, but what of that?  He didn't improve a bit that I could see.    He was always frightening me, always breaking out with fresh  astonishers, in new and unexpected places.  Toward evening on  the second day, what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk  from inside his robe!    \"Great guns, my liege, where did you get that?\"    \"From a smuggler at the inn, yester eve.\"    \"What in the world possessed you to buy it?\"    \"We have escaped divers dangers by wit--thy wit--but I have  bethought me that it were but prudence if I bore a weapon, too.  Thine might fail thee in some pinch.\"    \"But people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms.  What  would a lord say--yes, or any other person of whatever condition  --if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person?\"    It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then.  I persuaded him to throw the dirk away; and it was as easy as  persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing  itself.  We walked along, silent and thinking.  Finally the king said:    \"When ye know that I meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hath  a peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?\"    It was a startling question, and a puzzler.  I didn't quite know  how to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, I ended  by saying the natural thing:    \"But, sire, how can I know what your thoughts are?\"    The king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.    \"I believed thou wert greater than Merlin; and truly in magic  thou art.  But prophecy is greater than magic.  Merlin is a prophet.\"    I saw I had made a blunder.  I must get back my lost ground.  After a deep reflection and careful planning, I said:    \"Sire, I have been misunderstood.  I will explain.  There are two  kinds of prophecy.  One is the gift to foretell things that are but  a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that  are whole ages and centuries away.  Which is the mightier gift,  do you think?\"    \"Oh, the last, most surely!\"    \"True.  Does Merlin possess it?\"    \"Partly, yes.  He foretold mysteries about my birth and future  kingship that were twenty years away.\"    \"Has he ever gone beyond that?\"    \"He would not claim more, I think.\"    \"It is probably his limit.  All prophets have their limit.  The limit  of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.\"    \"These are few, I ween.\"    \"There have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four  hundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed  even seven hundred and twenty.\"    \"Gramercy, it is marvelous!\"    \"But what are these in comparison with me?  They are nothing.\"    \"What?  Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch  of time as--\"    \"Seven hundred years?  My liege, as clear as the vision of an eagle  does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this  world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!\"    My land, you should have seen the king's eyes spread slowly open,  and lift the earth's entire atmosphere as much as an inch!  That  settled Brer Merlin.  One never had any occasion to prove his  facts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.  It  never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement.    \"Now, then,\" I continued, \"I _could_ work both kinds of prophecy  --the long and the short--if I chose to take the trouble to keep  in practice; but I seldom exercise any but the long kind, because  the other is beneath my dignity.  It is properer to Merlin's sort  --stump-tail prophets, as we call them in the profession.  Of course,  I whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but not  often--hardly ever, in fact.  You will remember that there was  great talk, when you reached the Valley of Holiness, about my  having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival,  two or three days beforehand.\"    \"Indeed, yes, I mind it now.\"    \"Well, I could have done it as much as forty times easier, and  piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7248"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 7.

Clemens)                               Part 7.        CHAPTER XXXII    DOWLEY'S HUMILIATION    Well, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, Saturday afternoon,  I had my hands full to keep the Marcos from fainting.  They were  sure Jones and I were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves  as accessories to this bankruptcy.  You see, in addition to the  dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum,  I had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family:  for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables  of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit's; also a sizeable  deal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which was  another piece of extravagance in those people's eyes; also crockery,  stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on.  I instructed  the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to give  me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little.  Concerning  the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up  and down, all night, to see if it wasn't nearly daylight, so that  they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much  as an hour before dawn was due.  Then their pleasure--not to say  delirium--was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it  paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered.  The king had slept just as usual--like the dead.  The Marcos could  not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they  tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful  they were.  Which all went for nothing: he didn't notice any change.    It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is  just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be  out of doors.  Toward noon the guests arrived, and we assembled  under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances.  Even the king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little  trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at  first.  I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer;  but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing  stand at that, and not elaborate it any.  Because he was just the  kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like  that if you didn't warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his  spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.    Dowley was in fine feather, and I early got him started, and then  adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and  himself for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him  hum.  Self-made man, you know.  They know how to talk.  They do  deserve more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true;  and they are among the very first to find it out, too.  He told how  he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends  able to help him; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest  master lived; how his day's work was from sixteen to eighteen hours  long, and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a  half-fed condition; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted  the attention of a good blacksmith, who came near knocking him  dead with kindness by suddenly offering, when he was totally  unprepared, to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years  and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade--or \"mystery\"  as Dowley called it.  That was his first great rise, his first  gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn't yet speak  of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a  gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human  being.  He got no new clothing during his apprenticeship, but on  his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens  and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine.    \"I remember me of that day!\" the wheelwright sang out, with  enthusiasm.    \"And I likewise!\" cried the mason.  \"I would not believe they  were thine own; in faith I could not.\"    \"Nor other!\" shouted Dowley, with sparkling eyes.  \"I was like  to lose my character, the neighbors wending I had mayhap been  stealing.  It was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not  days like that.\"    Yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always  had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white  bread, true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak.  And in time Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter.    \"And now consider what is come to pass,\" said he, impressively.  \"Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table.\"  He made a pause here, to let that fact sink home, then added  --\"and eight times salt meat.\"    \"It is even true,\" said the wheelwright, with bated breath.    \"I know it of mine own knowledge,\" said the mason, in the same  reverent fashion.    \"On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year,\"  added the master smith, with solemnity.  \"I leave it to your own  consciences, friends, if this is not also true?\"    \"By my head, yes,\" cried the mason.    \"I can testify it--and I do,\" said the wheelwright.    \"And as to furniture, ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment  is.\"  He waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and  unhampered freedom of speech, and added: \"Speak as ye are moved;  speak as ye would speak; an I were not here.\"    \"Ye have five stools, and of the sweetest workmanship at that, albeit  your family is but three,\" said the wheelwright, with deep respect.    \"And six wooden goblets, and six platters of wood and two of pewter  to eat and drink from withal,\" said the mason, impressively.  \"And  I say it as knowing God is my judge, and we tarry not here alway,  but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body,  be they false or be they sooth.\"    \"Now ye know what manner of man I am, brother Jones,\" said the  smith, with a fine and friendly condescension, \"and doubtless ye  would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and  but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be  assured, but trouble yourself not, as concerning that; wit ye well  ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is  willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth  a right heart in his body, be his worldly estate howsoever modest.  And in token of it, here is my hand; and I say with my own mouth  we are equals--equals\"--and he smiled around on the company with  the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious  thing and is quite well aware of it.    The king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance, and  let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish; all of which  had a good effect, for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural  to one who was being called upon by greatness.    The dame brought out the table now, and set it under the tree.  It caused a visible stir of surprise, it being brand new and a  sumptuous article of deal.  But the surprise rose higher still  when the dame, with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore,  but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity,  slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it.  That was a notch above even the blacksmith's domestic grandeurs,  and it hit him hard; you could see it.  But Marco was in Paradise;  you could see that, too.  Then the dame brought two fine new  stools--whew! that was a sensation; it was visible in the eyes of  every guest.  Then she brought two more--as calmly as she could.  Sensation again--with awed murmurs.  Again she brought two  --walking on air, she was so proud.  The guests were petrified, and  the mason muttered:    \"There is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence.\"    As the dame turned away, Marco couldn't help slapping on the climax  while the thing was hot; so he said with what was meant for a  languid composure but was a poor imitation of it:    \"These suffice; leave the rest.\"    So there were more yet!  It was a fine effect.  I couldn't have  played the hand better myself.    From this out, the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that  fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the  shade, and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to  gasped \"Oh's\" and \"Ah's,\" and mute upliftings of hands and eyes.  She fetched crockery--new, and plenty of it; new wooden goblets  and other table furniture; and beer, fish, chicken, a goose, eggs,  roast beef, roast mutton, a ham, a small roast pig, and a wealth  of genuine white wheaten bread.  Take it by and large, that spread  laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had  seen before.  And while they sat there just simply stupefied with  wonder and awe, I sort of waved my hand as if by accident, and  the storekeeper's son emerged from space and said he had come  to collect.    \"That's all right,\" I said, indifferently.  \"What is the amount?  give us the items.\"    Then he read off this bill, while those three amazed men listened,  and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate  waves of terror and admiration surged over Marco's:       2 pounds salt . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   200     8 dozen pints beer, in the wood . . . . .   800     3 bushels wheat . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,700     2 pounds fish . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   100     3 hens  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   400     1 goose . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   400     3 dozen eggs  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   150     1 roast of beef . . . . . . . . . . . . .   450     1 roast of mutton . . . . . . . . . . . .   400     1 ham . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   800     1 sucking pig . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500     2 crockery dinner sets  . . . . . . . . . 6,000  "]]]
