The presentation is probably much less detached than is the case  with other volumes in this series. But the difference was scarcely  avoidable. The writer was not expounding a religious system which has  no relation to his own life. On the contrary, the writer is himself a  Jew, and thus is deeply concerned personally in the matters discussed  in the book.    The reader must be warned to keep this fact in mind throughout. On the one  hand, the book must suffer a loss of objectivity; but, on the other hand,  there may be some compensating gain of intensity. The author trusts,  at all events, that, though he has not written with indifference, he  has escaped the pitfall of undue partiality.    I. A.        CONTENTS         I.

THE SURVIVAL OF JUDAISM          SELECTED LIST OF BOOKS ON JUDAISM          JUDAISM        CHAPTER I    THE LEGACY FROM THE PAST      The aim of this little book is to present in brief outline some of the  leading conceptions of the religion familiar since the Christian Era  under the name Judaism.    The word 'Judaism' occurs for the first time at about 100 B.C., in the  Graeco-Jewish literature. In the second book of the Maccabees (ii. 21,  viii. 1), 'Judaism' signifies the religion of the Jews as contrasted with  Hellenism, the religion of the Greeks. In the New Testament (Gal. i. 13)  the same word seems to denote the Pharisaic system as an antithesis to  the Gentile Christianity. In Hebrew the corresponding noun never occurs  in the Bible, and it is rare even in the Rabbinic books. When it does  meet us, _Jahaduth_ implies the monotheism of the Jews as opposed  to the polytheism of the heathen.    Thus the term 'Judaism' did not pass through quite the same transitions  as did the name 'Jew.' Judaism appears from the first as a religion  transcending tribal bounds. The 'Jew,' on the other hand, was originally  a Judaean, a member of the Southern Confederacy called in the Bible  Judah, and by the Greeks and Romans Judaea. Soon, however, 'Jew' came  to include what had earlier been the Northern Confederacy of Israel as  well, so that in the post-exilic period _Jehudi_ or 'Jew' means an  adherent of Judaism without regard to local nationality.    Judaism, then, is here taken to represent that later development of  the Religion of Israel which began with the reorganisation after the  Babylonian Exile (444 B.C.), and was crystallised by the Roman Exile  (during the first centuries of the Christian Era). The exact period  which will be here seized as a starting-point is the moment when the  people of Israel were losing, never so far to regain, their territorial  association with Palestine, and were becoming (what they have ever since  been) a community as distinct from a nation. They remained, it is true,  a distinct race, and this is still in a sense true. Yet at various  periods a number of proselytes have been admitted, and in other ways  the purity of the race has been affected. At all events territorial  nationality ceased from a date which may be roughly fixed at 135 A.D.,  when the last desperate revolt under Bar-Cochba failed, and Hadrian drew  his Roman plough over the city of Jerusalem and the Temple area. A new  city with a new name arose on the ruins. The ruins afterwards reasserted  themselves, and Aelia Capitolina as a designation of Jerusalem is familiar  only to archaeologists.    But though the name of Hadrian's new city has faded, the effect of  its foundation remained. Aelia Capitolina, with its market-places and  theatre, replaced the olden narrow-streeted town; a House of Venus reared  its stately form in the north, and a Sanctuary to Jupiter covered, in the  east, the site of the former Temple. Heathen colonists were introduced,  and the Jew, who was to become in future centuries an alien everywhere,  was made by Hadrian an alien in his fatherland. For the Roman Emperor  denied to Jews the right of entry into Jerusalem. Thus Hadrian completed  the work of Titus, and Judaism was divorced from its local habitation.  More unreservedly than during the Babylonian Exile, Judaism in the Roman  Exile perforce became the religion of a community and not of a state;  and Israel for the first time constituted a Church. But it was a Church  with no visible home. Christianity for several centuries was to have a  centre at Rome, Islam at Mecca. But Judaism had and has no centre at all.    It will be obvious that the aim of the present book makes it both  superfluous and inappropriate to discuss the vexed problems connected with  the origins of the Religion of Israel, its aspects in primitive times,  its passage through a national to an ethical monotheism, its expansion  into the universalism of the second Isaiah. What concerns us here is  merely the legacy which the Religion of Israel bequeathed to Judaism as  we have defined it. This legacy and the manner in which it was treasured,  enlarged, and administered will occupy us in the rest of this book.    But this much must be premised. If the Religion of Israel passed through  the stages of totemism, animism, and polydemonism; if it was indebted  to Canaanite, Kenite, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and other foreign  influences; if it experienced a stage of monolatry or henotheism (in  which Israel recognised one God, but did not think of that God as the  only God of all men) before ethical monotheism of the universalistic  type was reached; if, further, all these stages and the moral and  religious ideas connected with each left a more or less clear mark in  the sacred literature of Israel; then the legacy which Judaism received  from its past was a syncretism of the whole of the religious experiences  of Israel as interpreted in the light of Israel's latest, highest, most  approved standards. Like the Bourbon, the Jew forgets nothing; but unlike  the Bourbon, the Jew is always learning. The domestic stories of the  Patriarchs were not rejected as unprofitable when Israel became deeply  impregnated with the monogamous teachings of writers like the author  of the last chapter of Proverbs; the character of David was idealised  by the spiritual associations of the Psalter, parts of which tradition  ascribed to him; the earthly life was etherialised and much of the sacred  literature reinterpreted in the light of an added belief in immortality;  God, in the early literature a tribal non-moral deity, was in the later  literature a righteous ruler who with Amos and Hosea loved and demanded  righteousness in man. Judaism took over as one indivisible body of sacred  teachings both the early and the later literature in which these varying  conceptions of God were enshrined; the Law was accepted as the guiding  rule of life, the ritual of ceremony and sacrifice was treasured as a holy  memory, and as a memory not contradictory of the prophetic exaltation of  inward religion but as consistent with that exaltation, as interpreting  it, as but another aspect of Micah's enunciation of the demands of God:  'What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, to love mercy,  and to walk humbly with thy God?'    Judaism, in short, included for the Jew all that had gone before. But  for St. Paul's attitude of hostility to the Law, but for the deep-seated  conviction that the Pauline Christianity was a denial of the Jewish  monotheism, the Jew might have accepted much of the teaching of Jesus as  an integral part of Judaism. In the realm of ideas which he conceived as  belonging to his tradition the Jew was not logical; he did not pick and  choose; he absorbed the whole. In the Jewish theology of all ages we find  the most obvious contradictions. There was no attempt at reconciliation  of such contradictions; they were juxtaposed in a mechanical mixture,  there was no chemical compound. The Jew was always a man of moods, and  his religion responded to those varying phases of feeling and belief  and action. Hence such varying judgments have been formed of him and his  religion. If, after the mediaeval philosophy had attempted to systematise  Judaism, the religion remained unsystematic, it is easy to understand  that in the earlier centuries of the Christian Era contradictions  between past and present, between different strata of religious thought,  caused no trouble to the Jew so long as those contradictions could be  fitted into his general scheme of life. Though he was the product of  development, development was an idea foreign to his conception of the  ways of God with man. And to this extent he was right. For though men's  ideas of God change, God Himself is changeless. The Jew transferred the  changelessness of God to men's changing ideas about him. With childlike  naivete he accepted all, he adopted all, and he syncretised it all as best  he could into the loose system on which Pharisaism grafted itself. The  legacy of the past thus was the past.    One element in the legacy was negative. The Temple and the Sacrificial  system were gone for ever. That this must have powerfully affected  Judaism goes without saying. Synagogue replaced Temple, prayer assumed  the function of sacrifice, penitence and not the blood of bulls supplied  the ritual of atonement. Events had prepared the way for this change and  had prevented it attaining the character of an upheaval.

He was disgusted, mortified; no other word for  it. He had no objection, of course, to Mr Mellish saying that his work  during the term, and especially his Livy, had been disgraceful. A  master has the right to say that sort of thing if he likes. It is one  of the perquisites of the position. But when he went on to observe,  without a touch of shame, that there would be an examination in the  Livy as far as they had gone in it on the following Saturday,  Pillingshot felt that he exceeded. It was not playing the game. There  were the examinations at the end of term. Those were fair enough. You  knew exactly when they were coming, and could make your arrangements  accordingly. But to spring an examination on you in the middle of the  term out of a blue sky, as it were, was underhand and unsportsmanlike,  and would not do at all. Pillingshot wished that he could put his foot  down. He would have liked to have stalked up to Mr Mellish's desk,  fixed him with a blazing eye, and remarked, 'Sir, withdraw that remark.  Cancel that statement instantly, or--!' or words to that effect.    What he did say was: 'Oo, si-i-r!!'    'Yes,' said Mr Mellish, not troubling to conceal his triumph  at Pillingshot's reception of the news, 'there will be a Livy  examination next Saturday. And--' (he almost intoned this last  observation)--'anybody who does not get fifty per cent, Pillingshot,  fifty per cent, will be severely punished. Very severely punished,  Pillingshot.'    After which the lesson had proceeded on its course.    'Yes, it is rather low, isn't it?' said Pillingshot's friend, Parker,  as Pillingshot came to the end of a stirring excursus on the rights of  the citizen, with special reference to mid-term Livy examinations.  'That's the worst of Mellish. He always has you somehow.'    'But what am I to _do_?' raved Pillingshot.    'I should advise you to swot it up before Saturday,' said Parker.    'Oh, don't be an ass,' said Pillingshot, irritably.    What was the good of friends if they could only make idiotic  suggestions like that?    He retired, brooding, to his house.    The day was Wednesday. There were only two more days, therefore, in  which to prepare a quarter of a book of Livy. It couldn't be done. The  thing was not possible.    In the house he met Smythe.    'What are you going to do about it?' he inquired. Smythe was top of the  form, and if he didn't know how to grapple with a crisis of this sort,  who _could_ know?    'If you'll kindly explain,' said Smythe, 'what the dickens you are  talking about, I might be able to tell you.'    Pillingshot explained, with unwonted politeness, that 'it' meant the  Livy examination.    'Oh,' said Smythe, airily, 'that! I'm just going to skim through it in  case I've forgotten any of it. Then I shall read up the notes  carefully. And then, if I have time, I shall have a look at the history  of the period. I should advise you to do that, too.'    'Oh, don't be a goat,' said Pillingshot.    And he retired, brooding, as before.    That afternoon he spent industriously, copying out the fourth book of  _The Aeneid_. At the beginning of the week he had had a slight  disagreement with M. Gerard, the French master.    Pillingshot's views on behaviour and deportment during French lessons  did not coincide with those of M. Gerard. Pillingshot's idea of a  French lesson was something between a pantomime rally and a scrum at  football. To him there was something wonderfully entertaining in the  process of 'barging' the end man off the edge of the form into space,  and upsetting his books over him. M. Gerard, however, had a very  undeveloped sense of humour. He warned the humorist twice, and on the  thing happening a third time, suggested that he should go into extra  lesson on the ensuing Wednesday.    So Pillingshot went, and copied out Virgil.    He emerged from the room of detention at a quarter past four. As he  came out into the grounds he espied in the middle distance somebody  being carried on a stretcher in the direction of the School House. At  the same moment Parker loomed in sight, walking swiftly towards the  School shop, his mobile features shining with the rapt expression of  one who sees much ginger-beer in the near future.    'Hullo, Parker,' said Pillingshot, 'who's the corpse?'    'What, haven't you heard?' said Parker. 'Oh, no, of course, you were in  extra. It's young Brown. He's stunned or something.'    'How did it happen?'    'That rotter, Babington, in Dacre's. Simply slamming about, you know,  getting his eye in before going in, and Brown walked slap into one of  his drives. Got him on the side of the head.'    'Much hurt?'    'Oh, no, I don't think so. Keep him out of school for about a week.'    'Lucky beast. Wish somebody would come and hit me on the head. Come  and hit me on the head, Parker.'    'Come and have an ice,' said Parker.    'Right-ho,' said Pillingshot. It was one of his peculiarities, that  whatever the hour or the state of the weather, he was always equal to  consuming an ice. This was probably due to genius. He had an infinite  capacity for taking pains. Scarcely was he outside the promised ice  when another misfortune came upon him. Scott, of the First Eleven,  entered the shop. Pillingshot liked Scott, but he was not blind to  certain flaws in the latter's character. For one thing, he was too  energetic. For another, he could not keep his energy to himself. He was  always making Pillingshot do things. And Pillingshot's notion of the  ideal life was complete _dolce far niente_.    'Ginger-beer, please,' said Scott, with parched lips. He had been  bowling at the nets, and the day was hot. 'Hullo! Pillingshot, you  young slacker, why aren't you changed? Been bunking half-holiday games?  You'd better reform, young man.'    'I've been in extra,' said Pillingshot, with dignity.    'How many times does that make this term? You're going for the record,  aren't you? Jolly sporting of you. Bit slow in there, wasn't it?  'Nother ginger-beer, please.'    'Just a bit,' said Pillingshot.    'I thought so. And now you're dying for some excitement. Of course you  are. Well, cut over to the House and change, and then come back and  field at the nets. The man Yorke is going to bowl me some of his  celebrated slow tosh, and I'm going to show him exactly how Jessop does  it when he's in form.'    Scott was the biggest hitter in the School. Mr Yorke was one of the  masters. He bowled slow leg-breaks, mostly half-volleys and long hops.  Pillingshot had a sort of instinctive idea that fielding out in the  deep with Mr Yorke bowling and Scott batting would not contribute  largely to the gaiety of his afternoon. Fielding deep at the nets meant  that you stood in the middle of the football field, where there was no  telling what a ball would do if it came at you along the ground. If you  were lucky you escaped without injury. Generally, however, the ball  bumped and deprived you of wind or teeth, according to the height to  which it rose. He began politely, but firmly, to excuse himself.    'Don't talk rot,' said Scott, complainingly, 'you must have some  exercise or you'll go getting fat. Think what a blow it would be to  your family, Pillingshot, if you lost your figure. Buck up. If you're  back here in a quarter of an hour you shall have another ice. A large  ice, Pillingshot, price sixpence. Think of it.'    The word ice, as has been remarked before, touched chords in  Pillingshot's nature to which he never turned a deaf ear. Within the  prescribed quarter of an hour he was back again, changed.    'Here's the ice,' said Scott, 'I've been keeping it warm for you.  Shovel it down. I want to be starting for the nets. Quicker, man,  quicker! Don't roll it round your tongue as if it was port. Go for it.  Finished? That's right. Come on.'    Pillingshot had not finished, but Scott so evidently believed that he  had, that it would have been unkind to have mentioned the fact. He  followed the smiter to the nets.    If Pillingshot had passed the earlier part of the afternoon in a  sedentary fashion, he made up for it now. Scott was in rare form, and  Pillingshot noticed with no small interest that, while he invariably  hit Mr Yorke's deliveries a quarter of a mile or so, he never hit two  balls in succession in the same direction. As soon as the panting  fieldsman had sprinted to one side of the football ground and returned  the ball, there was a beautiful, musical _plonk_, and the ball  soared to the very opposite quarter of the field. It was a fine  exhibition of hitting, but Pillingshot felt that he would have enjoyed  it more if he could have watched it from a deck-chair.    'You're coming on as a deep field, young Pillingshot,' said Scott, as  he took off his pads. 'You've got a knack of stopping them with your  stomach, which the best first-class fields never have. You ought to  give lessons at it. Now we'll go and have some tea.'    If Pillingshot had had a more intimate acquaintance with the classics,  he would have observed at this point, '_Timeo "]]]
