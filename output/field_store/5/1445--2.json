THE TERROR OF THE PRAIRIES.    'HOWLY vargin! what is that?' exclaimed Mickey McSquizzle, with  something like horrified amazement.    'By the Jumping Jehosiphat, naow if that don't, beat all natur'!'    'It's the divil, broke loose, wid full steam on!'    There was good cause for these exclamations upon the part of the  Yankee and Irishman, as they stood on the margin of Wolf Ravine, and  gazed off over the prairie. Several miles to the north, something like  a gigantic man could be seen approaching, apparently at a rapid gait  for a few seconds, when it slackened its speed, until it scarcely  moved.    Occasionally it changed its course, so that it went nearly at right  angles. At such times, its colossal proportions were brought out in  full relief, looking like some Titan as it took its giant strides over  the prairie.    The distance was too great to scrutinize the phenomenon closely; but  they could see that a black volume of smoke issued either from its  mouth or the top of its head, while it was drawing behind it a sort of  carriage, in which a single man was seated, who appeared to control  the movements of the extraordinary being in front of him.    No wonder that something like superstitious have filled the breasts of  the two men who had ceased hunting for gold, for a few minutes, to  view the singular apparition; for such a thing had scarcely been  dreamed of at that day, by the most imaginative philosophers; much  less had it ever entered the head of these two men on the western  prairies.    'Begorrah, but it's the ould divil, hitched to his throttin 'waging,  wid his ould wife howlding the reins!' exclaimed Mickey, who had  scarcely removed his eyes from the singular object.    'That there critter in the wagon is a man,' said Hopkins, looking as  intently in the same direction. 'It seems to me,' he added, a moment  later, 'that there's somebody else a-sit-ting alongside of him, either  a dog or a boy. Wal, naow, ain't that queer?'    'Begorrah! begorrah! do ye hear that? What shall we do?'    At that instant, a shriek like that of some agonized giant came home  to them across the plains, and both looked around, as if about to flee  in terror; but the curiosity of the Yankee restrained him. His  practical eye saw that whatever it might be, it was a human  contrivance, and there could be nothing supernatural about it.    'Look!'    Just after giving its ear-splitting screech, it turned straight toward  the two men, and with the black smoke rapidly puffing from the top of  its head, came tearing along at a tremendous rate.    Mickey manifested some nervousness, but he was restrained by the  coolness of Ethan, who kept his position with his eye fixed keenly  upon it.    Coming at such a railroad speed, it was not long in passing the  intervening space. It was yet several hundred yards distant, when  Ethan Hopkins gave Mickey a ringing slap upon the shoulder.    'Jerusalem! who do ye s'pose naow, that man is sitting in the carriage  and holding the reins?'    'Worrah, worrah! why do you ax me, whin I'm so frightened entirely  that I don't know who I am myself?'    'Its Baldy.'    'Git out!' replied the Irishman, but added the next moment, 'am I  shlaping or dhraming? It's Baldy or his ghost.'    It certainly was no ghost, judging from the manner in which it acted;  for he sat with his hat cocked on one side, a pipe in his mouth, and  the two reins in his hands, just as the skillful driver controls the  mettlesome horses and keeps them well in hand.    He was seated upon a large pile of wood, while near nestled a little  hump-backed, bright-eyed boy, whose eyes sparkled with delight at the  performance of the strange machine.    The speed of the steam man gradually slackened, until it came opposite  the men, when it came to a dead halt, and the grinning 'Baldy,' as he  was called, (from his having lost his scalp several years before, by  the Indians), tipped his hat and said:    'Glad to see you hain't gone under yit. How'd you git along while I  was gone?'    But the men were hardly able to answer any questions yet, until they  had learned something more about the strange creation before them.  Mickey shied away, as the timid steed does at first sight of the  locomotive, observing which, the boy (at a suggestion from Baldy),  gave a string in his hand a twitch, whereupon the nose of the  wonderful thing threw out a jet of steam with the sharp screech of the  locomotive whistle. Mickey sprung a half dozen feet backward, and  would have run off at full speed down the ravine, had not Ethan  Hopkins caught his arm.    'What's the matter, Mickey, naow! Hain't you ever heard anything like  a locomotive whistle?'    'Worrah, worrah, now, but is that the way the crather blows its nose?  It must have a beautiful voice when it shnores at night.'    Perhaps at this point a description of the singular mechanism should  be given. It was about ten feet in hight, measuring to the top of the  'stove-pipe hat,' which was fashioned after the common order of felt  coverings, with a broad brim, all painted a shiny black. The face was  made of iron, painted a black color, with a pair of fearful eves, and  a tremendous grinning mouth. A whistle-like contrivance was trade to  answer for the nose. The steam chest proper and boiler, were where the  chest in a human being is generally supposed to be, extending also  into a large knapsack arrangement over the shoulders and back. A pair  of arms, like projections, held the shafts, and the broad flat feet  were covered with sharp spikes, as though he were the monarch of  base-ball players. The legs were quite long, and the step was natural,  except when running, at which time, the bolt uprightness in the figure  showed different from a human being.    In the knapsack were the valves, by which the steam or water was  examined. In front was a painted imitation of a vest, in which a door  opened to receive the fuel, which, together with the water, was  carried in the wagon, a pipe running along the shaft and connecting  with the boiler.    The lines which the driver held controlled the course of the steam  man; thus, by pulling the strap on the right, a deflection was caused  which turned it in that direction, and the same acted on the other  side. A small rod, which ran along the right shaft, let out or shut  off the steam, as was desired, while a cord, running along the left,  controlled the whistle at the nose.    The legs of this extraordinary mechanism were fully a yard apart, so  as to avoid the danger of its upsetting, and at the same time, there  was given more room for the play of the delicate machinery within.  Long, sharp, spike-like projections adorned those toes of the immense  feet, so that there was little danger of its slipping, while the  length of the legs showed that, under favorable circumstances, the  steam man must be capable of very great speed.    After Ethan Hopkins had some what familiarized himself with the  external appearance of this piece of mechanism, he ventured upon a  more critical examination.    The door being opened in front, showed a mass of glowing coals lying  in the capacious abdomen of the giant; the hissing valves in the  knapsack made themselves apparent, and the top of the hat or  smoke-stack had a sieve-like arrangement, such as is frequently seen  on the locomotive.    There were other little conveniences in the way of creating a draft,  and of shutting it off when too great, which could scarcely be  understood without a scrutiny of the figure itself.    The steam man was a frightful looking object, being painted of a  glossy black, with a pair of white stripes down its legs, and with a  face which was intended to be of a flesh color, but, which was really  a fearful red.    To give the machinery an abundance of room, the steam man was  exceedingly corpulent, swelling out to aldermanic proportions, which,  after all, was little out of harmony with its immense hight.    The wagon dragged behind was an ordinary four-wheeled vehicle, with  springs, and very strong wheels, a framework being arranged, so that  when necessary it could be securely covered. To guard against the  danger of upsetting it was very broad, with low wheels, which it may  be safely said were made to 'hum' when the gentleman got fairly under  way.    Such is a brief and Imperfect description of this wonderful steam man,  as it appeared on its first visit to the Western prairies.                           CHAPTER II. 'HANDLE ME GENTLY.'    WHEN Ethan Hopkins had surveyed the steam man fully, he drew a long  sigh and exclaimed:    'Wal, naow, that's too had!'    'What's that?' inquired Bicknell, who had been not a little amused at  his open-mouthed amazement.    'Do you know I've been thinking of that thing for ten years, ever  since I went through Colt's pistol factory in Hartford, when I was a  youngster?'    'Did you ever think of any plan!'    'I never got it quite right, but I intended to do it after we got  through digging for gold. The thing was just taking shape in my head.  See here, naow, ain't you going to give a fellow a ride?'

BY    IDA LEE, F.R.G.S.  (MRS. CHARLES BRUCE MARRIOTT.)    AUTHOR OF:  THE COMING OF THE BRITISH TO AUSTRALIA,  [and]  COMMODORE SIR JOHN HAYES, HIS VOYAGE AND LIFE.    WITH SIXTEEN CHARTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE ORIGINALS  IN THE ADMIRALTY LIBRARY.      GRAFTON & CO.  69 GREAT RUSSELL STREET  LONDON. W.C.      First Published in 1915.      TO THE MEMORY OF MY GRANDFATHER,  WILLIAM LEE,  ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S PIONEERS.            PREFACE.      The objects for which the Lady Nelson's voyages were undertaken render  her logbooks of more than ordinary interest. She was essentially an  Australian discovery ship and during her successive commissions she was  employed exclusively in Australian waters. The number of voyages that she  made will perhaps never be accurately known, but her logbooks in  existence testify to the important missions that she accomplished. The  most notable are those which record early discoveries in Victoria: the  exploration of the Queensland coast: the surveys of King Island and the  Kent Group: the visits to New Zealand and the founding of settlements at  Hobart, Port Dalrymple, and Melville Island. Seldom can the logbooks of a  single ship show such a record. Their publication seemed very necessary,  for the handwriting on the pages of some of them is so faded that it is  already difficult to decipher, and apparently only the story of Grant's  voyages and the extracts from Murray's log published by Labilliere in the  Early History of Victoria have ever before been published. In  transcription I have somewhat modernized the spelling where old or  incorrect forms tended to obscure the sense, and omitted repetitions, as  it would have been impossible to include within the limits of one volume  the whole of the contents of the logbooks. The story of the Lady Nelson  as told by Grant has in places been paraphrased, for he sometimes writes  it in diary form under date headings and at others he inserts the date in  the narrative. The entries from the logbooks of Murray, Curtoys and  Symons, in the Public Record Office, with such omissions as I have  specified, are printed verbatim.    Murray's charts now published are distinctly valuable, as in the fourth  volume of the Historical Records of New South Wales, where they should be  found, it is stated that they are \"unfortunately missing.\"    On my inquiring at the Admiralty, Mr. Perrin, the Librarian, to whom my  cordial thanks are due, made a special search and was fortunate enough to  discover them. Thus, after a long separation, Murray's charts and his  journal are united again in this volume. Perhaps the most important  chart, and the one which should appeal especially to the people of  Victoria, is that of Port Phillip showing the track of the Lady Nelson's  boat when the brig entered the bay for the first time. Murray's log  telling of this discovery ends on March 24th, 1802. In writing later to  the Duke of Portland, Governor King says: \"The Lady Nelson's return just  before I closed my letters enabled me to transmit Acting-Lieutenant  Murray's log copies of the discoveries of King Island and Port Phillip.  These important discoveries, being combined with the chart of former  surveys, I hope will convince your Grace that that highly useful vessel  the Lady Nelson has not been idle under my direction.\" The charts were  sent home in charge of Lieutenant Mackellar, who sailed in the ship  Caroline on March 30th, 1802, six days after the Lady Nelson's return.  Duplicates were forwarded by the Speedy, which left Sydney in June, but a  comparison of those at the Admiralty shows that King added nothing  further to this second series.    My thanks are also due to Lieutenant Bell, R.N., whose researches have  enabled me to publish the charts of the Queensland coast. These old  charts cannot fail to interest students of Australian history. It is  possible that they do not include all that were sent home at first, nor  are the Lady Nelson's logbooks complete; those however of Grant and  Murray, Curtoys and Symons, give us the story of the work carried out by  those energetic seamen. They are writings worthy of being more widely  known, for they are records left by men who sailed uncharted seas along  unknown coasts in days which will not come again--men who have helped to  give to later generations a spacious continent with a limitless horizon.

Drawn by Governor King. Writing of this chart, he says that the  longitude in which Lieutenant Grant placed Cape Otway was about a degree  and a half in error. He also made the land to trend away on the west side  of Cape Otway to a deep bay, which he named Portland Bay. An examination  of modern maps will show that the name Portland Bay has been retained for  a bay to the westward of Grant's Portland Bay, which is now called  Armstrong Bay.

This earliest chart of King  Island was drawn by Alexander Dalrymple from a sketch made by Flinders of  Murray's original chart. Flinders added to it the west coast unseen by  Murray, though it had been sighted by both Black and Buyers. The details  given by Flinders were supplied by William Campbell, master of the  Harrington, who, in March 1802, found a quantity of wreckage there.  Nothing remained to show the name of the lost vessel, nor was any clue  subsequently discovered by which she could be identified. The Harrington  lay at anchor at New Year's Isles for over two months, but could not  trace the nationality of the vessel or her crew except in the language of  the Harrington's captain, \"one dead English cat.\" See Historical Records  of New South Wales volume 4 page 780.)      6. THE LADY NELSON AND THE FRANCIS SCHOONER ENTERING HUNTER RIVER.      7. COAL HARBOUR (NEWCASTLE, NEW SOUTH WALES), SURVEYED BY ENSIGN  BARRALLIER IN 1801.    Coal Harbour and Rivers on the Coast of New South Wales. Surveyed by  Ensign Barrallier, in His Majesty's Armed Surveying Vessel Lady Nelson:  Lieutenant James Grant Commander. In June and July 1801, by Order of  Governor King.    High Water Full and Change in the Harbour 9 hours 45 minutes. Rises 6  feet.    Remarks on Hunter's River: The entrance of Hunter's River is in latitude  32 degrees 57 minutes south, distinguishable by an Island on the  south-east side of its entrance which in coming from the northward  appears like a castle, being perpendicular on the south-east side and 203  feet high: the north side is steep and covered with grass. It is the  northernmost high land from Sydney to the Heads of Port Stephens from  which it lies north-east 6 leagues. The intermediate space being a sandy  beach. The tides both in the harbour and entrance runs very strong, and  in some places not less than four miles an hour and sometimes from four  to five. The ebb in general is much stronger than the flood: 9 3/4 hours  in the harbour makes high water full and change, and rises six feet  perpendicular where the Lady Nelson anchored, and four feet when she was  higher up the river. In the harbour there is good shelter from all winds  and plenty of room for more than 100 sail of shipping. There is plenty of  water to be had on the north shore by digging a very little way down.  There are three wells already dug, and the water is very good. On the  south shore there are plenty of runs of fresh water.
