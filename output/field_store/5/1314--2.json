LOVECRAFT           \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras--dire stories of Celæno and       the Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of       superstition--_but they were there before_. They are transcripts,       types--the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the       recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come       to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from       such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to       inflict upon us bodily injury? Oh, least of all! _These terrors       are of older standing. They date beyond body_--or without the       body, they would have been the same.... That the kind of fear here       treated is purely spiritual--that it is strong in proportion as it       is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our       sinless infancy--are difficulties the solution of which might       afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and       a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.\"--Charles       Lamb: _Witches and Other Night-Fears_.      1    When a traveler in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork  at the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean's Corners he  comes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and  the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts  of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts  seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a  luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the  planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely  scattered houses wear a surprizing uniform aspect of age, squalor, and  dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions  from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling  doorsteps or in the sloping, rock-strewn meadows. Those figures are  so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden  things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a  rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods,  the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too  rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and  sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles  of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.    Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the  crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road  dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively  dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills  chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to  the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs.  The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper reaches has an oddly  serpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills  among which it rises.    As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their  stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously  that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by  which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village  huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain,  and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an  earlier architectural period than that of the neighboring region. It  is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses  are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church  now harbors the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet.  One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no  way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a  faint, malign odor about the village street, as of the massed mold and  decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place,  and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across  the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward  one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.    Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain  season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken  down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more  than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer  tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship,  and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to  give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age--since  the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town's  and the world's welfare at heart--people shun it without knowing  exactly why. Perhaps one reason--though it can not apply to uninformed  strangers--is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having  gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England  backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the  well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.  The average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals  reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and  deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry,  representing the two or three armigerous families which came from  Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay;  though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that  only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of  the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and  Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel  roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.    No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror,  can say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak  of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they  called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and  made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and  rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley,  newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a  memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps, in which  he said:         It must be allow'd that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train       of Dæmons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the       cursed Voices of _Azazel_ and _Buzrael_, of _Beelzebub_ and       _Belial_, being heard from under Ground by above a Score of       credible Witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a       Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the       Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling,       Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth       cou'd raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves       that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.    Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the  text, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills  continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to  geologists and physiographers.    Other traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of  stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at  certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines;  while still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard--a bleak,  blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then,  too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills  which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are  psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they  time their eery cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath.  If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they  instantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they  fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.    These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come  down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old--older by  far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the  village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient  Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill  at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture  to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century  factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great  rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more  generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of  skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable  table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such  spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many  ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory,  persist in believing the remains Caucasian.      2    It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited  farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile  and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5  a. m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled  because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe  under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded,  and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout  the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother  was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive  albino woman of 35, living with an aged"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#1)"],[1,"GOLD    A ROMANCE OF THE BORDER      BY    ZANE GREY          CONTENTS       Prologue         I.

It was there in the white  heart of the dying campfire; it hung in the shadows that hovered over  the flickering light; it drifted in the darkness beyond.    This hour, when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in  with its dead silence, was one in which Cameron's mind was thronged  with memories of a time long past--of a home back in Peoria, of a woman  he had wronged and lost, and loved too late.  He was a prospector for  gold, a hunter of solitude, a lover of the drear, rock-ribbed  infinitude, because he wanted to be alone to remember.    A sound disturbed Cameron's reflections.  He bent his head listening. A  soft wind fanned the paling embers, blew sparks and white ashes and  thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness.  His burro  did not appear to be moving about.  The quiet split to the cry of a  coyote.  It rose strange, wild, mournful--not the howl of a prowling  upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector, but  the wail of a wolf, full-voiced, crying out the meaning of the desert  and the night.  Hunger throbbed in it--hunger for a mate, for  offspring, for life.  When it ceased, the terrible desert silence smote  Cameron, and the cry echoed in his soul. He and that wandering wolf  were brothers.    Then a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand  prompted Cameron to reach for his gun, and to move out of the light of  the waning campfire.  He was somewhere along the wild border line  between Sonora and Arizona; and the prospector who dared the heat and  barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing.    Figures darker than the gloom approached and took shape, and in the  light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro.    \"Hello there,\" the man called, as he came to a halt and gazed about  him.  \"I saw your fire.  May I make camp here?\"    Cameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor, whom he  took for a prospector like himself.  Cameron resented the breaking of  his lonely campfire vigil, but he respected the law of the desert.    The stranger thanked him, and then slipped the pack from his burro.  Then he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal. His  movements were slow and methodical.    Cameron watched him, still with resentment, yet with a curious and  growing interest.  The campfire burst into a bright blaze, and by its  light Cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make  him old, and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression  of rugged strength.    \"Find any mineral?\" asked Cameron, presently.    His visitor looked up quickly, as if startled by the sound of a human  voice.  He replied, and then the two men talked a little. But the  stranger evidently preferred silence.  Cameron understood that.  He  laughed grimly and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed, shadowy face.  Another of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some  relentless driving power besides the lust for gold! Cameron felt that  between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity, vague and  undefined, perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert  wanderer like himself, perhaps born of a deeper, an unintelligible  relation having its roots back in the past.  A long-forgotten sensation  stirred in Cameron's breast, one so long forgotten that he could not  recognize it.  But it was akin to pain.        II    When he awakened he found, to his surprise, that his companion had  departed.  A trail in the sand led off to the north.  There was no  water in that direction.  Cameron shrugged his shoulders; it was not  his affair; he had his own problems.  And straightway he forgot his  strange visitor.    Cameron began his day, grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken,  for the canyon-furrowed and cactus-spired scene that now showed no sign  of life.  He traveled southwest, never straying far from the dry stream  bed; and in a desultory way, without eagerness, he hunted for signs of  gold.    The work was toilsome, yet the periods of rest in which he indulged  were not taken because of fatigue.  He rested to look, to listen, to  feel.  What the vast silent world meant to him had always been a  mystical thing, which he felt in all its incalculable power, but never  understood.    That day, while it was yet light, and he was digging in a moist  white-bordered wash for water, he was brought sharply up by hearing the  crack of hard hoofs on stone.  There down the canyon came a man and a  burro.  Cameron recognized them.    \"Hello, friend,\" called the man, halting.  \"Our trails crossed again.  That's good.\"    \"Hello,\" replied Cameron, slowly.  \"Any mineral sign to-day?\"    \"No.\"    They made camp together, ate their frugal meal, smoked a pipe, and  rolled in their blankets without exchanging many words.  In the morning  the same reticence, the same aloofness characterized the manner of  both.  But Cameron's companion, when he had packed his burro and was  ready to start, faced about and said:  \"We might stay together, if it's  all right with you.\"    \"I never take a partner,\" replied Cameron.    \"You're alone; I'm alone,\" said the other, mildly.  \"It's a big place.  If we find gold there'll be enough for two.\"    \"I don't go down into the desert for gold alone,\" rejoined Cameron,  with a chill note in his swift reply.    His companion's deep-set, luminous eyes emitted a singular flash. It  moved Cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had met no  man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat, the blinding  dust storms, the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus, the  terrible silence and desolation of the desert. Cameron waved a hand  toward the wide, shimmering, shadowy descent of plain and range.  \"I  may strike through the Sonora Desert.  I may head for Pinacate or north  for the Colorado Basin.  You are an old man.\"    \"I don't know the country, but to me one place is the same as another,\"  replied his companion.  For moments he seemed to forget himself, and  swept his far-reaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and  sand.  Then with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind Cameron.  \"Yes, I'm old.  I'm lonely, too.  It's come to me just lately.  But,  friend, I can still travel, and for a few days my company won't hurt  you.\"    \"Have it your way,\" said Cameron.    They began a slow march down into the desert.  At sunset they camped  under the lee of a low mesa.  Cameron was glad his comrade had the  Indian habit of silence.  Another day's travel found the prospectors  deep in the wilderness.  Then there came a breaking of reserve,  noticeable in the elder man, almost imperceptibly gradual in Cameron.  Beside the meager mesquite campfire this gray-faced, thoughtful old  prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little;  and Cameron would listen, and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a  word.  And so, as Cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert  less lonely than habitual, he began to take keener note of his comrade,  and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the  wilderness. This man never grumbled at the heat, the glare, the driving  sand, the sour water, the scant fare.  During the daylight hours he was  seldom idle.  At night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and  fro in the gloom.  He slept but little, and that long after Cameron had  had his own rest.  He was tireless, patient, brooding.    Cameron's awakened interest brought home to him the realization that  for years he had shunned companionship.  In those years only three men  had wandered into the desert with him, and these had left their bones  to bleach in the shifting sands.  Cameron had not cared to know their  secrets.  But the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began  to suspect that he might have missed something in the others.  In his  own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of  silence and desolation, where he could be alone with it, he had  forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men.  Somehow this silent  comrade reminded him.    One afternoon late, after they had toiled up a white, winding wash of  sand and gravel, they came upon a dry waterhole.  Cameron dug deep into  the sand, but without avail.  He was turning to retrace weary steps  back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait.  Cameron  watched him search in his pack and bring forth what appeared to be a  small, forked branch of a peach tree.  He grasped the prongs of the  fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out, and  then he began to walk along the stream bed.  Cameron, at first amused,  then amazed, then pitying, and at last curious, kept pace with the  prospector.  He saw a strong tension of his comrade's wrists, as if he  was holding hard against a considerable force.  The end of the peach  branch began to quiver and turn.  Cameron reached out a hand to touch  it, and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the  branch downward.  He felt it as a magnetic shock.  The branch kept  turning, and at length pointed to the ground.    \"Dig here,\" said the"]]]
