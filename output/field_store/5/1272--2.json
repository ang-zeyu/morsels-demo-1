Pappina was only seven years of age, but she was different from  every other child living in dingy, dirty San Lucia. Few even of the  grown people of the neighborhood cared to be clean, and as for their  hair--why, they paid no attention to that, but let it go as it found  itself. But Pappina took delight in combing her silky black hair and in  washing her beautiful face and dimpled hands.    This was a wonder to all who lived near.    \"The one who washes! _Per bacco_ [Great heavens]!\" they said when they  saw her. But their amazement did not disturb Pappina. She went about  her play in the sordid old tenement-court like a sunbeam astray.    [Illustration: Doing the family washing in Italy]    Only when she sang and danced and the people gathered around her did  she seem to take much notice of her neighbors.    \"Such a voice in one so small! It is from the angels!\" the women would  say, as, charmed by her singing and her grace, they would toss her _un  soldo_ (a half-penny).    The other children would run with every _soldo_ to buy macaroni, for  the children were always hungry in San Lucia, where even _soldi_ are  scarce; but Pappina, a true little Neapolitan, loved dress and display.  She spent her money for trinkets with which to adorn her bewitching,  graceful self.    Pappina's love of beauty sprang from her eager little heart like a  sweet flower from a patch of rich earth on a rocky hillside.    It grew with very little nourishment from without, for in all her  seven years she had hardly been out of sight of the hivelike tenement  where her hard-working father himself had been born. On rare days she  was taken to a near-by street where for generations the women of the  neighborhood had gone to do their family washing at a free fountain;  and of course, as all little girls in Italy do, she went to a gray old  church regularly with her mother. Down the narrow street, past the  mean shops, to church was the longest journey out into the world the  bright-eyed little maiden had ever taken.    [Illustration: In San Lucia]    Her brothers, however, were great travelers. Sometimes at night they  came home with tales of the wonderful foreigners who thronged the  Toledo, of the splendid shops where all the treasures of the earth were  gathered--jewels that sparkled like the sun; flowers that smelled like  a breath of heaven; rich and gay clothes! Pappina sat with shining  eyes and listened to these amazing tales until her heart was full of a  longing to go and see for herself the wonders described.    On some mornings after drinking in news of the unknown world to which  her brothers journeyed every day, Pappina would follow them down the  stairs, through the court, out upon the cobble-stoned street, with  outstretched hands, crying:    \"Take me, Filippo, Vittorio!\"    \"_Non oggi, sorella_ [Not to-day, sister],\" they laughed as they dodged  between the people in the street.    Sometimes she would follow her brothers for some distance, only to be  taken back into the courtyard of the tenement when they discovered  her running after them. Pappina, who had a temper of her own, returned  more often in anger than in tears.    One day a great resolve came to her as she stood watching them go away.    \"I've staved at home long enough,\" she said to herself. \"They won't  take me, but I'm going; I'm surely going.\"    Pappina spent all the morning in adorning herself for the journey. Time  and again her mother called to her:    \"Pappina, _bambina_ [baby], what are you doing?\"    But Pappina, standing before a bit of looking-glass, never heard the  call, she was so busy pinning on a bit of lace or a ribbon, or combing  and curling her tresses.    Soon after noon a grotesque little figure darted out of the tenement  and down the street. Without looking to right or left it ran swiftly  for a short distance, and then it stopped and looked back to see if any  one were following. Then Pappina--for it was she--moved on, bound for  the Toledo.    She held her head up proudly, and all the bits of lace and ribbon that  she had fastened to her faded little frock fluttered about her as she  hurried on--toward the Toledo she thought, but, in truth, over the  bridge that leads to the Marina or wharf at Castle dell'Ovo.    The place had no historic interest for her. Pappina knew nothing of  history; she was just a poor little Neapolitan girl. Only foreign  tourists visited the oval-shaped castle because it was the place where  Cicero met Brutus bloody-handed from the murder of Caesar; where kings  and queens had dwelt and been imprisoned. She saw only the crowds of  people--the divine people who made the wonderland her brothers told  about.    Some of the people were waving their arms toward the water and  laughing. Pappina approached the edge of the wharf, that she might see  everything that was going on.    Well-dressed men were throwing money into the waves.    \"What wealth they must have!\" exclaimed Pappina to herself. \"Such queer  words they speak, too! These must be the foreigners Vittorio tells  about!\"    She drew still nearer and saw that the people were laughing at the way  a mob of half-naked boys were diving for the _soldi_ the foreigners  threw into the water, bringing the coins up in their mouths.    \"Oh, the foreigners are not crazy; they are only kind,\" she thought.    She turned at a burst of laughter behind her, and there were more  foreigners throwing _soldi_ to more boys who were standing on their  heads, turning hand-springs, and crying: \"_Date_ [give] _un soldo_.\"    Pappina was astonished. There were blond-haired Englishmen, blue-eyed  Germans, black-whiskered Russians, generous Americans; and such  wonderful ladies everywhere!    \"Where do all the _soldi_ come from?\" she murmured as she stood gazing  about her in amazement.    Suddenly a group of light-hearted tourists, bent on discovering all the  treasures of a foreign land, swept around Pappina.    \"What a quaint little beauty!\" one lady exclaimed. \"See how she has  decked herself out in all her finery! What cherubic eyes!\"    Pappina clasped her hands to her breast and shrank back from the  gaze of the eyes fastened upon her. She was such a little girl, and  never before had she been so far away from home; no wonder the sudden  attention of all these finely dressed ladies and gentlemen frightened  her.    \"I must go home,\" she exclaimed; \"I must run home and tell them all  about it. Oh, what a grand time I've had!\" She laughed aloud as she  broke through the crowd and darted away.    On ran Pappina until she spied the statues of La Villa, and then,  although the beauty of the park was before her eyes, she was  frightened. Where was her home--her dear, dear home? where were her  brothers and sisters? Pappina was lost.    Suddenly her lips stopped quivering: forgotten were her home and her  fright. Her little feet paused.    A band! Wonder of wonders! For the first time in her life Pappina  heard the whole air aquiver. Streams of sweet sound swept around her.  Her whole body tingled, down to her feet. She began to dance with the  unconsciousness of a music-mad little child. Tapping her toes on the  pavement, gliding and swaying to and fro with the music, keeping time  with her arms, dancing with truly wonderful grace, she had drawn a  large group of people about her by the time the waltz had ceased.    \"Bravo! Bravo!\" the people cried as they showered _soldi_ upon the  surprised little girl.    She drew back, frightened.    \"Yours, all yours!\" called some voices.    She began picking up the coins as she laughed her thanks. Her chubby  little hands were soon so full that she dropped some _soldi_ every  time she picked up one. She gave a perplexed sigh, then suddenly made  a purse of her apron and filled it with the jingling money. How the  people laughed at her cleverness!    Rich little Pappina! The luxuries of the world--her world--were now  within her reach. What should she buy? For a moment her bright eyes  rested on the strings of macaroni some boys near her were eating. She  felt a sudden hunger, but she had wanted a coral necklace"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive)                                            OUT WITH GARIBALDI                        MR.

In many respects it rivals  the conquest of Mexico by Cortez. The latter won, not by the greater  bravery of his troops, but by their immense superiority in weapons and  defensive armour. Upon the contrary, Garibaldi's force were ill-armed  and practically without artillery, and were opposed by an army of a  hundred and twenty thousand men carrying the best weapons of the time,  and possessing numerous and powerful artillery. In both cases the  invaders were supported by a portion of the population who had been  reduced to a state of servitude, and who joined them against their  oppressors. There is another point of resemblance between these  remarkable expeditions, inasmuch as the leaders of both were treated  with the grossest ingratitude by the monarchs for whom they had gained  such large acquisitions of territory. For the leading incidents in the  campaign I have relied chiefly upon Garibaldi's Autobiography and the  personal narrative of the campaign by Captain Forbes, R.N.    G. A. HENTY.

CHAPTER I.    AWAITING THE ATTACK.      On April 29th, 1849, two men were seated in a room whose open windows  commanded a view down the Tiber. A sound of confused uproar rose from  the city.    \"I am afraid, Leonard,\" the elder of the two men said, \"that the crisis  is at hand. The news that the French are landing to-day at Civita  Vecchia is ominous indeed. It is true that Oudinot has sent a message  saying that the flag he has hoisted is that of peace and order. The  people will not believe that he comes as an enemy; but, for my part, I  have no doubt of it.\"    \"Nor have I,\" the other replied. \"It was bad enough that we had Austria  against us, Sardinia powerless, and all the princelings of Italy  hostile; but that France, having proclaimed herself a republic, should  now interfere to crush us and to put the Pope back upon his throne is  nothing short of monstrous. I feared that it would be so, but Mazzini  had so much faith in his influence with members of the French Assembly  that he has buoyed up the hopes of the populace, and even now the people  generally believe that the French come as friends.\"    \"It is doubtless the influence of their new president, Napoleon, that  has turned the scale against us,\" the other said gloomily. \"I do not  suppose that he cares about the Pope one way or the other, but it is his  interest to pose as his champion. By so doing he will gain the good  opinion of Austria, of Naples, and the ducal rulers of the Italian  states. Even Prussia, protestant as she is, would view with satisfaction  the suppression of a rising like ours, for her throne well-nigh tottered  in last year's explosion. Russia, too, which perhaps more than any other  power has reason to fear a popular rising, would feel grateful to  Napoleon for undertaking to crush free thought in Rome. It is evident  that the French President's move is a politic one. Do you think that we  shall fight, Leonard?\"    \"I fancy so. I have no belief in Mazzini's courage, president though he  may be. Garibaldi is the popular hero, and I know him well enough to be  sure that if he has but a handful of men to back him he will fight till  the end. We had the odds as heavily against us when we were  comrades-in-arms at Rio, with but the Susie and a merchantman with three  or four guns against the whole Brazilian navy, or when, with the Italian  volunteers, two hundred strong, we several times withstood the assault  of five times our number.
