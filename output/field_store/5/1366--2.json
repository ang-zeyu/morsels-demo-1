PART I    Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed;  for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those  even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not  usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already  possess.  And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken the  conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging  aright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what  is called  good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and  that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from  some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but  solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways,  and do not fix our attention on the same objects.  For to be possessed  of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to  apply it.  The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest  excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those  who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they  keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run,  forsake it.    For myself, I have never fancied my mind to be in any respect more  perfect than those of the generality; on the contrary, I have often  wished that I were equal to some others in promptitude of thought, or  in clearness and distinctness of imagination, or in fullness and  readiness of memory.  And besides these, I know of no other qualities  that contribute to the perfection of the mind; for as to the reason or  sense, inasmuch as it is that alone which constitutes us men, and  distinguishes us from the brutes, I am disposed to believe that it is  to be found complete in each individual; and on this point to adopt the  common opinion of philosophers, who say that the difference of greater  and less holds only among the accidents, and not among the forms or  natures of individuals of the same species.    I will not hesitate, however, to avow my belief that it has been my  singular good  fortune to have very early in life fallen in with  certain tracks which have conducted me to considerations and maxims, of  which I have formed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of  gradually augmenting my knowledge, and of raising it by little and  little to the highest point which the mediocrity of my talents and the  brief duration of my life will permit me to reach.  For I have already  reaped from it such fruits that, although I have been accustomed to  think lowly enough of myself, and although when I look with the eye of  a philosopher at the varied courses and pursuits of mankind at large, I  find scarcely one which does not appear in vain and useless, I  nevertheless derive the highest satisfaction from the progress I  conceive myself to have already made in the search after truth, and  cannot help entertaining such expectations of the future as to believe  that if, among the occupations of men as men, there is any one really  excellent and important, it is that which I have chosen.    After all, it is possible I may be mistaken; and it is but a little  copper and glass, perhaps, that I take for gold and diamonds.  I know  how very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and  also how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when  given in our favor.  But I shall endeavor in this discourse to describe  the paths I have followed, and to delineate my life as in a picture, in  order that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself, and  that in the general opinion entertained of them, as gathered from  current report, I myself may have a new help towards instruction to be  added to those I have been in the habit of employing.    My present design, then, is not to teach the method which each ought to  follow for the right conduct of his reason, but solely to describe the  way in which I have endeavored to conduct my own.  They who set  themselves to give precepts must of course regard themselves as  possessed of greater skill than those to whom they prescribe; and if  they err in the slightest particular, they subject themselves to  censure.  But as this tract is put forth merely as a history, or, if  you will, as a tale, in which, amid some examples worthy of imitation,  there will be found, perhaps, as many more which it were advisable not  to follow, I hope it will prove useful to some without being hurtful to  any, and that my openness will find some favor with all.    From my childhood, I have been familiar with letters; and as I was  given to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of  all that is useful in life might be acquired, I was ardently desirous  of instruction.  But as soon as I had finished the entire course of  study, at the close of which it is customary to be admitted into the  order of the learned, I completely changed my opinion.  For I found  myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I  had advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the  discovery at every turn of my own ignorance.  And yet I was studying in  one of the most celebrated schools in Europe, in which I thought there  must be learned men,  if such were anywhere to be found.  I had been  taught all that others learned there; and not contented with the  sciences actually taught us, I had, in addition, read all the books  that had fallen into my hands, treating of such branches as are  esteemed the most curious and rare.  I knew the judgment which others  had formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to  my fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked  out to fill the places of our instructors.  And, in fine, our age  appeared to me as flourishing, and as fertile in powerful minds as any  preceding one.  I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all  other men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in  existence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to  believe.    I still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the  schools.  I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary  to the understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of  fable stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it;  and, if read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the  perusal of all excellent books is,  as it were, to interview with the  noblest men of past ages, who have written them, and even a studied  interview, in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts;  that eloquence has incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its  ravishing graces and delights; that in the mathematics there are many  refined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as  well as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous  highly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in  treatises on morals; that theology points out the path to heaven; that  philosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth  on all matters, and commands the admiration of the more simple; that  jurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences, secure for their  cultivators honors and riches; and, in fine, that it is useful to  bestow some attention upon all, even upon those abounding the most in  superstition and error, that we may be in a position to determine their  real value, and guard against being deceived.    But I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages,  and likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their  histories and fables.   For to hold converse with those of other ages  and to travel, are almost the same thing.  It is useful to know  something of the manners of different nations, that we may be enabled  to form a more correct judgment regarding our own, and be prevented  from thinking that everything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and  irrational, a conclusion usually come to by those whose experience has  been limited to their own country.  On the other hand, when too much  time is occupied in traveling, we become strangers to our native  country; and the over curious in the customs of the past are generally  ignorant of those of the present.  Besides, fictitious narratives lead  us to imagine the possibility of many events that are impossible; and  even the most faithful histories, if they do not wholly misrepresent  matters, or exaggerate their importance to render the account of them  more worthy of perusal, omit, at least, almost always the meanest and  least striking of the attendant circumstances; hence it happens that  the remainder does not represent the truth, and that such as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#1)"],[1,"from the Charles Scribner's Sons 1905 edition by David Price,  email ccx074@pglaf.org            ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON  A RECORD, AN ESTIMATE, AND A MEMORIAL      BY ALEXANDER H.

First,  about the facsimile of last page of Preface to _Familiar Studies of Men  and Books_.  Stevenson was in Davos when the greater portion of that work  went through the press.  He felt so much the disadvantage of being there  in the circumstances (both himself and his wife ill) that he begged me to  read the proofs of the Preface for him.  This illness has record in the  letter from him (pp. 28-29).  The printers, of course, had directions to  send the copy and proofs of the Preface to me.  Hence I am able now to  give this facsimile.    With regard to the letter at p. 19, of which facsimile is also given,  what Stevenson there meant is not the \"three last\" of that batch, but the  three last sent to me before--though that was an error on his part--he  only then sent two chapters, making the \"eleven chapters now\"--sent to me  by post.    Another point on which I might have dwelt and illustrated by many  instances is this, that though Stevenson was fond of hob-nobbing with all  sorts and conditions of men, this desire of wide contact and intercourse  has little show in his novels--the ordinary fibre of commonplace human  beings not receiving much celebration from him there; another case in  which his private bent and sympathies received little illustration in his  novels.  But the fact lies implicit in much I have written.    I have to thank many authors for permission to quote extracts I have  used.    ALEXANDER H. JAPP.          CONTENTS      I.

LETTERS AND POEMS IN TESTIMONY  APPENDIX          CHAPTER I--INTRODUCTION AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS      My little effort to make Thoreau better known in England had one result  that I am pleased to think of.  It brought me into personal association  with R. L. Stevenson, who had written and published in _The Cornhill  Magazine_ an essay on Thoreau, in whom he had for some time taken an  interest.  He found in Thoreau not only a rare character for originality,  courage, and indefatigable independence, but also a master of style, to  whom, on this account, as much as any, he was inclined to play the part  of the \"sedulous ape,\" as he had acknowledged doing to many others--a  later exercise, perhaps in some ways as fruitful as any that had gone  before.  A recent poet, having had some seeds of plants sent to him from  Northern Scotland to the South, celebrated his setting of them beside  those native to the Surrey slope on which he dwelt, with the lines--       \"And when the Northern seeds are growing,     Another beauty then bestowing,     We shall be fine, and North to South     Be giving kisses, mouth to mouth.\"    So the Thoreau influence on Stevenson was as if a tart American  wild-apple had been grafted on an English pippin, and produced a wholly  new kind with the flavours of both; and here wild America and England  kissed each other mouth to mouth.    The direct result was the essay in _The Cornhill_, but the indirect  results were many and less easily assessed, as Stevenson himself, as we  shall see, was ever ready to admit.  The essay on Thoreau was written in  America, which further, perhaps, bears out my point.    One of the authorities, quoted by Mr Hammerton, in _Stevensoniana_ says  of the circumstances in which he found our author, when he was busily  engaged on that bit of work:       \"I have visited him in a lonely lodging in California, it was previous     to his happy marriage, and found him submerged in billows of     bed-clothes; about him floated the scattered volumes of a complete set     of Thoreau; he was preparing an essay on that worthy, and he looked at     the moment like a half-drowned man, yet he was not cast down.  His     work, an endless task, was better than a straw to him.  It was to     become his life-preserver and to prolong his years.  I feel convinced     that without it he must have surrendered long since.  I found     Stevenson a man of the frailest physique, though most unaccountably     tenacious of life; a man whose pen was indefatigable, whose brain was     never at rest, who, as far as I am able to judge, looked upon     everybody and everything from a supremely intellectual point of view.\"     {1}    We remember the common belief in Yorkshire and other parts that a man  could not die so long as he could stand up--a belief on which poor  Branwell Bronte was fain to act and to illustrate, but R. L. Stevenson  illustrated it, as this writer shows, in a better, calmer, and healthier  way, despite his lack of health.    On some little points of fact, however, Stevenson was wrong; and I wrote  to the Editor of _The Spectator_ a letter, titled, I think, \"Thoreau's  Pity and Humour,\" which he inserted.  This brought me a private letter  from Stevenson, who expressed the wish to see me, and have some talk with  me on that and other matters.  To this letter I at once replied,  directing to 17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, saying that, as I was soon to be  in that City, it might be possible for me to see him there.  In reply to  this letter Mr Stevenson wrote:       \"THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR,     _Sunday_, _August_ (? _th_), 1881.       \"MY DEAR SIR,--I should long ago have written to thank you for your     kind and frank letter; but, in my state of health, papers are apt to     get mislaid, and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this     (Sunday) morning.       \"I must first say a word as to not quoting your book by name.  It was     the consciousness that we disagreed which led me, I daresay, wrongly,     to suppress _all_ references throughout the paper.  But you may be     certain a proper reference will now be introduced.       \"I regret I shall not be able to see you in Edinburgh: one visit to     Edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that invaluable particular,     health; but if it should be at all possible for you to pass by     Braemar, I believe you would find an attentive listener, and I can     offer you a bed, a drive, and necessary food.       \"If, however, you should not be able to come thus far, I can promise     two things.  First, I shall religiously revise what I have written,     and bring out more clearly the point of view from which I regarded     Thoreau.  Second, I shall in the preface record your objection.       \"The point of view (and I must ask you not to forget that any such     short paper is essentially only a _section through_ a man) was this: I     desired to look at the man through his books.  Thus, for instance,     when I mentioned his return to the pencil-making, I did it only in     passing (perhaps I was wrong), because it seemed to me not an     illustration of his principles, but a brave departure from them.     Thousands of such there were I do not doubt; still they might be     hardly to my purpose; though, as you say so, I suppose some of them     would be.       \"Our difference as to 'pity,' I suspect, was a logomachy of my making.     No pitiful acts, on his part, would surprise me: I know he would be     more pitiful in practice than most of the whiners; but the spirit of     that practice would still seem to me to be unjustly described by the     word pity.       \"When I try to be measured, I find myself usually suspected of a     sneaking unkindness for my subject, but you may be sure, sir, I would     give up most other things to be as good a man as Thoreau.  Even my     knowledge of him leads me thus far.       \"Should you find yourself able to push on so far--it may even lie on     your way--believe me your visit will be very welcome.  The weather is     cruel, but the place is, as I daresay you know, the very _wale_ of     Scotland--bar Tummelside.--Yours very sincerely,       ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"    {Manuscript letter by R.L.S.: p6.jpg}    Some delay took place in my leaving London for Scotland, and hence what  seemed a hitch.  I wrote mentioning the reason of my delay, and  expressing the "]]]
