Clemens)                               Part 8.        CHAPTER XXXVI    AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK    London--to a slave--was a sufficiently interesting place.  It was  merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch.  The streets  were muddy, crooked, unpaved.  The populace was an ever flocking  and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and  shining armor.  The king had a palace there; he saw the outside  of it.  It made him sigh; yes, and swear a little, in a poor  juvenile sixth century way.  We saw knights and grandees whom  we knew, but they didn't know us in our rags and dirt and raw  welts and bruises, and wouldn't have recognized us if we had hailed  them, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speak  with slaves on a chain.  Sandy passed within ten yards of me on  a mule--hunting for me, I imagined.  But the thing which clean  broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old  barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man  being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.  It was  the sight of a newsboy--and I couldn't get at him!  Still, I had  one comfort--here was proof that Clarence was still alive and  banging away.  I meant to be with him before long; the thought was  full of cheer.    I had one little glimpse of another thing, one day, which gave me  a great uplift.  It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop.  Telegraph or telephone, sure.  I did very much wish I had a little  piece of it.  It was just what I needed, in order to carry out my  project of escape.  My idea was to get loose some night, along with  the king, then gag and bind our master, change clothes with him,  batter him into the aspect of a stranger, hitch him to the slave-chain,  assume possession of the property, march to Camelot, and--    But you get my idea; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise  I would wind up with at the palace.  It was all feasible, if  I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could  shape into a lock-pick.  I could then undo the lumbering padlocks  with which our chains were fastened, whenever I might choose.  But I never had any luck; no such thing ever happened to fall  in my way.  However, my chance came at last.  A gentleman who  had come twice before to dicker for me, without result, or indeed  any approach to a result, came again.  I was far from expecting  ever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the time  I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked either  anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it--twenty-two  dollars.  He wouldn't bate a cent.  The king was greatly admired,  because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was against  him, and he wasn't salable; nobody wanted that kind of a slave.  I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my  extravagant price.  No, I was not expecting to ever belong to  this gentleman whom I have spoken of, but he had something which  I expected would belong to me eventually, if he would but visit  us often enough.  It was a steel thing with a long pin to it, with  which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in  front.  There were three of them. He had disappointed me twice,  because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project  entirely safe; but this time I succeeded; I captured the lower  clasp of the three, and when he missed it he thought he had lost  it on the way.    I had a chance to be glad about a minute, then straightway a chance  to be sad again.  For when the purchase was about to fail, as usual,  the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus  --in modern English:    \"I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'm tired supporting these two for  no good.  Give me twenty-two dollars for this one, and I'll throw  the other one in.\"    The king couldn't get his breath, he was in such a fury.  He began  to choke and gag, and meantime the master and the gentleman moved  away discussing.    \"An ye will keep the offer open--\"    \"'Tis open till the morrow at this hour.\"    \"Then I will answer you at that time,\" said the gentleman, and  disappeared, the master following him.    I had a time of it to cool the king down, but I managed it.  I whispered in his ear, to this effect:    \"Your grace _will_ go for nothing, but after another fashion.  And  so shall I.  To-night we shall both be free.\"    \"Ah!  How is that?\"    \"With this thing which I have stolen, I will unlock these locks  and cast off these chains to-night.  When he comes about nine-thirty  to inspect us for the night, we will seize him, gag him, batter  him, and early in the morning we will march out of this town,  proprietors of this caravan of slaves.\"    That was as far as I went, but the king was charmed and satisfied.  That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get  to sleep and signify it by the usual sign, for you must not take  many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it.  It is  best to keep your own secrets.  No doubt they fidgeted only about  as usual, but it didn't seem so to me.  It seemed to me that they  were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring.  As the time dragged on I got nervously afraid we shouldn't have  enough of it left for our needs; so I made several premature  attempts, and merely delayed things by it; for I couldn't seem  to touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting a rattle  out of it which interrupted somebody's sleep and made him turn  over and wake some more of the gang.    But finally I did get my last iron off, and was a free man once  more.  I took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king's  irons.  Too late! in comes the master, with a light in one hand  and his heavy walking-staff in the other.  I snuggled close among  the wallow of snorers, to conceal as nearly as possible that I was  naked of irons; and I kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring  for my man the moment he should bend over me.    But he didn't approach.  He stopped, gazed absently toward our  dusky mass a minute, evidently thinking about something else;  then set down his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before  a body could imagine what he was going to do, he was out of the  door and had closed it behind him.    \"Quick!\" said the king.  \"Fetch him back!\"    Of course, it was the thing to do, and I was up and out in a  moment.  But, dear me, there were no lamps in those days, and  it was a dark night.  But I glimpsed a dim figure a few steps  away.  I darted for it, threw myself upon it, and then there was  a state of things and lively!  We fought and scuffled and struggled,  and drew a crowd in no time.  They took an immense interest in  the fight and encouraged us all they could, and, in fact, couldn't  have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own  fight.  Then a tremendous row broke out behind us, and as much  as half of our audience left us, with a rush, to invest some  sympathy in that.  Lanterns began to swing in all directions;  it was the watch gathering from far and near.  Presently a halberd  fell across my back, as a reminder, and I knew what it meant.  I was in custody.  So was my adversary.  We were marched off toward  prison, one on each side of the watchman.  Here was disaster,  here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction!  I tried to  imagine what would happen when the master should discover that  it was I who had been fighting him; and what would happen if they  jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty  law-breakers, as was the custom; and what might--    Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction,  the freckled light from the watchman's tin lantern fell on it,  and, by George, he was the wrong man!        CHAPTER XXXVII    AN AWFUL PREDICAMENT    Sleep?  It was impossible.  It would naturally have been impossible  in that noisome cavern of a jail, with its mangy crowd of drunken,  quarrelsome, and song-singing rapscallions.  But the thing that  made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of, was my  racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole  size of what might have happened yonder in the slave-quarters  in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine.    It was a long night, but the morning got around at last.  I made  a full and frank explanation to the court.  I said I was a slave,  the property of the great Earl Grip, who had arrived just after  dark at the Tabard inn in the village on the other side of the  water, and had stopped there over night, by compulsion, he being  taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder.  I had been  ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best  physician; I was doing my best; naturally I was running with all  my might; the night was dark, I ran against this common person  here, who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me, although  I told him my errand, and implored him, for the sake of the great  earl my master's mortal peril--    The common person interrupted and said it was a lie; and was going  to explain how I rushed upon him and attacked him without a word--    \"Silence, sirrah!\" from the court.  \"Take him hence and give him  a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of  a nobleman after a different fashion another time.  Go!\"    Then the court begged my pardon, and hoped I would not fail  to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court's fault that this  high-handed thing had happened.  I said I would make it all right,  and so took my leave.  Took it just in time, too; he was starting  to ask me why I didn't fetch out these facts the moment I was  arrested.  I said I would if I had thought of it--which was true  --but that I was so battered by that man "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7250"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 9.

Clemens)                               Part 9.        CHAPTER XLI    THE INTERDICT    However, my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters;  our child began to lose ground again, and we had to go to sitting  up with her, her case became so serious.  We couldn't bear to allow  anybody to help in this service, so we two stood watch-and-watch,  day in and day out.  Ah, Sandy, what a right heart she had, how  simple, and genuine, and good she was!  She was a flawless wife  and mother; and yet I had married her for no other particular  reasons, except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property  until some knight should win her from me in the field.  She had  hunted Britain over for me; had found me at the hanging-bout  outside of London, and had straightway resumed her old place at  my side in the placidest way and as of right.  I was a New Englander,  and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her,  sooner or later.  She couldn't see how, but I cut argument short  and we had a wedding.    Now I didn't know I was drawing a prize, yet that was what I did  draw.  Within the twelvemonth I became her worshiper; and ours  was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was.  People  talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same  sex.  What is the best of that sort, as compared with the friendship  of man and wife, where the best impulses and highest ideals of  both are the same?  There is no place for comparison between  the two friendships; the one is earthly, the other divine.    In my dreams, along at first, I still wandered thirteen centuries  away, and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up  and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world.  Many a  time Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep.  With a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our  child, conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine.  It touched me to tears, and it also nearly knocked me off my feet,  too, when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward, and played  her quaint and pretty surprise upon me:    \"The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved, here made  holy, and the music of it will abide alway in our ears.  Now  thou'lt kiss me, as knowing the name I have given the child.\"    But I didn't know it, all the same.  I hadn't an idea in the  world; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her  pretty game; so I never let on, but said:    \"Yes, I know, sweetheart--how dear and good it is of you, too!  But I want to hear these lips of yours, which are also mine, utter  it first--then its music will be perfect.\"    Pleased to the marrow, she murmured:    \"HELLO-CENTRAL!\"    I didn't laugh--I am always thankful for that--but the strain  ruptured every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward I could  hear my bones clack when I walked.  She never found out her mistake.  The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone  she was surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given  order for it: that henceforth and forever the telephone must  always be invoked with that reverent formality, in perpetual honor  and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake.  This  was not true.  But it answered.    Well, during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib, and in  our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of  that sick-room.  Then our reward came: the center of the universe  turned the corner and began to mend.  Grateful?  It isn't the term.  There _isn't_ any term for it.  You know that yourself, if you've  watched your child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it  come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one  all-illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand.    Why, we were back in this world in one instant!  Then we looked  the same startled thought into each other's eyes at the same  moment; more than two weeks gone, and that ship not back yet!    In another minute I appeared in the presence of my train.  They  had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time--their faces  showed it.  I called an escort and we galloped five miles to a  hilltop overlooking the sea.  Where was my great commerce that  so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful  with its white-winged flocks?  Vanished, every one!  Not a sail,  from verge to verge, not a smoke-bank--just a dead and empty  solitude, in place of all that brisk and breezy life.    I went swiftly back, saying not a word to anybody.  I told Sandy  this ghastly news.  We could imagine no explanation that would  begin to explain.  Had there been an invasion? an earthquake?  a pestilence?  Had the nation been swept out of existence?  But  guessing was profitless.  I must go--at once.  I borrowed the king's  navy--a \"ship\" no bigger than a steam launch--and was soon ready.    The parting--ah, yes, that was hard.  As I was devouring the child  with last kisses, it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary!  --the first time in more than two weeks, and it made fools of us  for joy.  The darling mispronunciations of childhood!--dear me,  there's no music that can touch it; and how one grieves when it  wastes away and dissolves into correctness, knowing it will never  visit his bereaved ear again.  Well, how good it was to be able  to carry that gracious memory away with me!    I approached England the next morning, with the wide highway of  salt water all to myself.  There were ships in the harbor, at  Dover, but they were naked as to sails, and there was no sign  of life about them.  It was Sunday; yet at Canterbury the streets  were empty; strangest of all, there was not even a priest in sight,  and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear.  The mournfulness of  death was everywhere.  I couldn't understand it.  At last, in  the further edge of that town I saw a small funeral procession  --just a family and a few friends following a coffin--no priest;  a funeral without bell, book, or candle; there was a church there  close at hand, but they passed it by weeping, and did not enter it;  I glanced up at the belfry, and there hung the bell, shrouded in  black, and its tongue tied back.  Now I knew!  Now I understood  the stupendous calamity that had overtaken England.  Invasion?  Invasion is a triviality to it.  It was the INTERDICT!    I asked no questions; I didn't need to ask any.  The Church had  struck; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise, and  go warily.  One of my servants gave me a suit of clothes, and  when we were safe beyond the town I put them on, and from that time  I traveled alone; I could not risk the embarrassment of company.    A miserable journey.  A desolate silence everywhere.  Even in  London itself.  Traffic had ceased; men did not talk or laugh, or  go in groups, or even in couples; they moved aimlessly about, each  man by himself, with his head down, and woe and terror at his heart.  The Tower showed recent war-scars.  Verily, much had been happening.    Of course, I meant to take the train for Camelot.  Train!  Why,  the station was as vacant as a cavern.  I moved on.  The journey  to Camelot was a repetition of what I had already seen.  The Monday  and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday.  I arrived  far in the night.  From being the best electric-lighted town in  the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever  saw, it was become simply a blot--a blot upon darkness--that is  to say, it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness,  and so you could see it a little better; it made me feel as if  maybe it was symbolical--a sort of sign that the Church was going to  _keep_ the upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization  just like that.  I found no life stirring in the somber streets.  I groped my way with a heavy heart.  The vast castle loomed black  upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it.  The drawbridge  was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge,  my own heels making the only sound I heard--and it was sepulchral  enough, in those huge vacant courts.        CHAPTER XLII    WAR!    I found Clarence alone in his quarters, drowned in melancholy;  and in place of the electric light, he had reinstituted the ancient  rag-lamp, and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains  drawn tight.  He sprang up and rushed for me eagerly, saying:    \"Oh, it's worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again!\"    He knew me as easily as if I hadn't been disguised at all.  Which  frightened me; one may easily believe that.    \"Quick, now, tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster,\" I said.  \"How did it come about?\"    \"Well, if there hadn't been any Queen Guenever, it wouldn't have  come so early; but it would have come, anyway.  It would have  come on your own account by and by; by luck, it happened to come  on the queen's.\"    \"_And_ Sir Launcelot's?\"    \"Just so.\"    \"Give me the details.\"    \"I reckon you will grant that during some years there has been  only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking  steadily askance at the queen and Sir Launcelot--\"    \"Yes, King Arthur's.\"    \"--and only one heart that was without suspicion--\"    \"Yes--the king's; a heart that isn't capable of thinking evil  of a friend.\"    \"Well, the king might have gone on, still happy and unsuspecting,  to the end of his days, but for one of your modern improvements  --the stock-board.  When you left, three miles of the London,  Canterbury and Dover were ready for the rails, and also ready and  ripe for manipulation in the stock-market.  It was wildcat, and  everybody knew it.  The stock was for sale at a give-away.  What  does Sir Launcelot do, but--\"    \"Yes, I know; he quietly picked up nearly"]]]
