MY DEAR LADS,    There are few figures in history who have individually exercised  so great an influence upon events as William Wallace and Robert  Bruce. It was to the extraordinary personal courage, indomitable  perseverance, and immense energy of these two men that Scotland  owed her freedom from English domination. So surprising were the  traditions of these feats performed by these heroes that it was at  one time the fashion to treat them as belonging as purely to legend  as the feats of St. George or King Arthur.  Careful investigation,  however, has shown that so far from this being the case, almost  every deed reported to have been performed by them is verified by  contemporary historians. Sir William Wallace had the especial bad  fortune of having come down to us principally by the writings of  his bitter enemies, and even modern historians, who should have  taken a fairer view of his life, repeated the cry of the old English  writers that he was a bloodthirsty robber. Mr. W. Burns, however,  in his masterly and exhaustive work, The Scottish War of Independence,  has torn these calumnies to shreds, and has displayed Wallace as  he was, a high minded and noble patriot. While consulting other  writers, especially those who wrote at the time of or but shortly  after the events they record, I have for the most part followed  Burns in all the historical portions of the narrative. Throughout  the story, therefore, wherein it at all relates to Wallace, Bruce,  and the other historical characters, the circumstances and events  can be relied upon as strictly accurate, save only in the earlier  events of the career of Wallace, of which the details that have  come down to us are somewhat conflicting, although the main features  are now settled past question.    Yours sincerely,    G.A. HENTY.          Chapter I    Glen Cairn      The village of Glen Cairn was situated in a valley in the broken  country lying to the west of the Pentland Hills, some fifteen miles  north of the town of Lanark, and the country around it was wild  and picturesque.  The villagers for the most part knew little of  the world beyond their own valley, although a few had occasionally  paid visits to Glasgow, which lay as far to the west as Lanark was  distant to the south. On a spur jutting out from the side of the  hill stood Glen Cairn Castle, whose master the villagers had for  generations regarded as their lord.    The glory of the little fortalice had now departed. Sir William  Forbes had been killed on his own hearthstone, and the castle had  been sacked in a raid by the Kerrs, whose hold lay to the southwest,  and who had long been at feud with the Forbeses. The royal power  was feeble, and the Kerrs had many friends, and were accordingly  granted the lands they had seized; only it was specified that Dame  Forbes, the widow of Sir William, should be allowed to reside in  the fortalice free from all let or hindrance, so long as she meddled  not, nor sought to stir up enmity among the late vassals of her  lord against their new masters.    The castle, although a small one, was strongly situated.  The spur  of the hill ran some 200 yards into the valley, rising sharply  some 30 or 40 feet above it. The little river which meandered down  the valley swept completely round the foot of the spur, forming a  natural moat to it, and had in some time past been dammed back, so  that, whereas in other parts it ran brightly over a pebbly bottom,  here it was deep and still. The fortalice itself stood at the  extremity of the spur, and a strong wall with a fortified gateway  extended across the other end of the neck, touching the water on  both sides.  From the gateway extended two walls inclosing a road  straight to the gateway of the hold itself, and between these walls  and the water every level foot of ground was cultivated; this garden  was now the sole remains of the lands of the Forbeses.    It was a narrow patrimony for Archie, the only son of Dame Forbes,  and his lady mother had hard work to keep up a respectable state,  and to make ends meet. Sandy Grahame, who had fought under her  husband's banner and was now her sole retainer, made the most of the  garden patches. Here he grew vegetables on the best bits of ground  and oats on the remainder; these, crushed between flat stones,  furnished a coarse bread.  From the stream an abundance of fish could  always be obtained, and the traps and nets therefore furnished a  meal when all else failed. In the stream, too, swam a score and more  of ducks, while as many chickens walked about the castle yard, or  scratched for insects among the vegetables. A dozen goats browsed  on the hillside, for this was common ground to the village, and  Dame Forbes had not therefore to ask for leave from her enemies,  the Kerrs. The goats furnished milk and cheese, which was deftly  made by Elspie, Sandy's wife, who did all the work indoors, as her  husband did without. Meat they seldom touched.  Occasionally the  resources of the hold were eked out by the present of a little  hill sheep, or a joint of prime meat, from one or other of her old  vassals, for these, in spite of the mastership of the Kerrs, still  at heart regarded Dame Mary Forbes as their lawful mistress, and  her son Archie as their future chief.  Dame Mary Forbes was careful  in no way to encourage this feeling, for she feared above all things  to draw the attention of the Kerrs to her son. She was sure that  did Sir John Kerr entertain but a suspicion that trouble might ever  come from the rivalry of this boy, he would not hesitate a moment  in encompassing his death; for Sir John was a rough and violent  man who was known to hesitate at nothing which might lead to his  aggrandizement. Therefore she seldom moved beyond the outer wall  of the hold, except to go down to visit the sick in the village.  She herself had been a Seaton, and had been educated at the nunnery  of Dunfermline, and she now taught Archie to read and write,  accomplishments by no means common even among the better class in  those days.  Archie loved not books; but as it pleased his mother,  and time often hung heavy on his hands, he did not mind devoting  two or three hours a day to the tasks she set him. At other times  he fished in the stream, wandered over the hills, and brought in  the herbs from which Dame Forbes distilled the potions which she  distributed to the villagers when sick.    Often he joined the lads of the village in their games.  They  all regarded him as their leader; but his mother had pressed upon  him over and over again that on no account was he to assume any  superiority over the others, but to treat them strictly as equals.  Doubtless the Kerrs would from time to time have news of what was  doing in Glen Cairn; and while they would be content to see him  joining in the sports of the village lads, with seemingly no wish  beyond that station, they would at once resent it did they see  any sign on his part of his regarding himself as a chief among the  others.    No inconsiderable portion of Archie's time was occupied in acquiring  the use of arms from Sandy Grahame. His mother, quiet and seemingly  resigned as she was, yet burned with the ambition that he should  some day avenge his father's death, and win back his father's lands.  She said little to him of her hopes; but she roused his spirit by  telling him stories of the brave deeds of the Forbeses and Seatons,  and she encouraged him from his childhood to practise in arms with  Sandy Grahame.    In this respect, indeed, Archie needed no stimulant.  From Sandy  even more than from his mother he had heard of his brave father's  deeds in arms; and although, from the way in which she repressed any  such utterances, he said but little to his mother, he was resolved  as much as she could wish him to be, that he would some day win  back his patrimony, and avenge his father upon his slayers.    Consequently, upon every opportunity when Sandy Grahame could spare  time from his multifarious work, Archie practised with him, with  sword and pike. At first he had but a wooden sword. Then, as his  limbs grew stronger, he practised with a blunted sword; and now  at the age of fifteen Sandy Grahame had as much as he could do to  hold his own with his pupil.    At the time the story opens, in the springtime of the year 1293,  he was playing at ball with some of the village lads on the green,  when a party of horsemen was seen approaching.    At their head rode two men perhaps forty years old, while a lad of  some eighteen years of age rode beside them.  In one of the elder  men Archie recognized Sir John Kerr.  The lad beside him was his  son Allan. The other leader was Sir John Hazelrig, governor of  Lanark; behind them rode a troop of armed men, twenty in number.  Some of the lads would have ceased from their play; but Archie  exclaimed:    \"Heed them not; make as if you did not notice them.  You need not  be in such a hurry to vail your bonnets to the Kerr.\"    \"Look at the young dogs,\" Sir John Kerr said to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#1)"],[1,"edition, as are all Project Gutenberg Editions, is Plain Vanilla ASCII,  meaning there are no characters other than what you would see on paper, thus  no page returns, no markup, nothing but the characters you would type if you  were to copy this from a book on a typewriter.

Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to      political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including      the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February      1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,      with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3      million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within      Afghanistan.
