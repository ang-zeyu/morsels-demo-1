THE THOUGHTS OF YOUTH    The sunshine of a day in early spring, honey pale and honey sweet, was  showering over the red brick buildings of Queenslea College and the  grounds about them, throwing through the bare, budding maples and elms,  delicate, evasive etchings of gold and brown on the paths, and coaxing  into life the daffodils that were peering greenly and perkily up under  the windows of the co-eds' dressing-room.    A young April wind, as fresh and sweet as if it had been blowing over  the fields of memory instead of through dingy streets, was purring in  the tree-tops and whipping the loose tendrils of the ivy network which  covered the front of the main building. It was a wind that sang of many  things, but what it sang to each listener was only what was in that  listener's heart. To the college students who had just been capped and  diplomad by \"Old Charlie,\" the grave president of Queenslea, in the  presence of an admiring throng of parents and sisters, sweethearts and  friends, it sang, perchance, of glad hope and shining success and high  achievement. It sang of the dreams of youth that may never be quite  fulfilled, but are well worth the dreaming for all that. God help the  man who has never known such dreams--who, as he leaves his alma mater,  is not already rich in aerial castles, the proprietor of many a spacious  estate in Spain. He has missed his birthright.    The crowd streamed out of the entrance hall and scattered over the  campus, fraying off into the many streets beyond. Eric Marshall and  David Baker walked away together. The former had graduated in Arts that  day at the head of his class; the latter had come to see the graduation,  nearly bursting with pride in Eric's success.    Between these two was an old and tried and enduring friendship, although  David was ten years older than Eric, as the mere tale of years goes, and  a hundred years older in knowledge of the struggles and difficulties of  life which age a man far more quickly and effectually than the passing  of time.    Physically the two men bore no resemblance to one another, although  they were second cousins. Eric Marshall, tall, broad-shouldered, sinewy,  walking with a free, easy stride, which was somehow suggestive of  reserve strength and power, was one of those men regarding whom  less-favoured mortals are tempted seriously to wonder why all the gifts  of fortune should be showered on one individual. He was not only clever  and good to look upon, but he possessed that indefinable charm of  personality which is quite independent of physical beauty or mental  ability. He had steady, grayish-blue eyes, dark chestnut hair with a  glint of gold in its waves when the sunlight struck it, and a chin that  gave the world assurance of a chin. He was a rich man's son, with a  clean young manhood behind him and splendid prospects before him. He  was considered a practical sort of fellow, utterly guiltless of romantic  dreams and visions of any sort.    \"I am afraid Eric Marshall will never do one quixotic thing,\" said  a Queenslea professor, who had a habit of uttering rather mysterious  epigrams, \"but if he ever does it will supply the one thing lacking in  him.\"    David Baker was a short, stocky fellow with an ugly, irregular, charming  face; his eyes were brown and keen and secretive; his mouth had a  comical twist which became sarcastic, or teasing, or winning, as he  willed. His voice was generally as soft and musical as a woman's; but  some few who had seen David Baker righteously angry and heard the tones  which then issued from his lips were in no hurry to have the experience  repeated.    He was a doctor--a specialist in troubles of the throat and voice--and  he was beginning to have a national reputation. He was on the staff of  the Queenslea Medical College and it was whispered that before long he  would be called to fill an important vacancy at McGill.    He had won his way to success through difficulties and drawbacks which  would have daunted most men. In the year Eric was born David Baker  was an errand boy in the big department store of Marshall & Company.  Thirteen years later he graduated with high honors from Queenslea  Medical College. Mr. Marshall had given him all the help which David's  sturdy pride could be induced to accept, and now he insisted on sending  the young man abroad for a post-graduate course in London and Germany.  David Baker had eventually repaid every cent Mr. Marshall had expended  on him; but he never ceased to cherish a passionate gratitude to  the kind and generous man; and he loved that man's son with a love  surpassing that of brothers.    He had followed Eric's college course with keen, watchful interest. It  was his wish that Eric should take up the study of law or medicine now  that he was through Arts; and he was greatly disappointed that Eric  should have finally made up his mind to go into business with his  father.    \"It's a clean waste of your talents,\" he grumbled, as they walked home  from the college. \"You'd win fame and distinction in law--that glib  tongue of yours was meant for a lawyer and it is sheer flying in the  face of Providence to devote it to commercial uses--a flat crossing of  the purposes of destiny. Where is your ambition, man?\"    \"In the right place,\" answered Eric, with his ready laugh. \"It is not  your kind, perhaps, but there is room and need for all kinds in this  lusty young country of ours. Yes, I am going into the business. In the  first place, it has been father's cherished desire ever since I was  born, and it would hurt him pretty badly if I backed out now. He wished  me to take an Arts course because he believed that every man should have  as liberal an education as he can afford to get, but now that I have had  it he wants me in the firm.\"    \"He wouldn't oppose you if he thought you really wanted to go in for  something else.\"    \"Not he. But I don't really want to--that's the point, David, man. You  hate a business life so much yourself that you can't get it into your  blessed noddle that another man might like it. There are many lawyers in  the world--too many, perhaps--but there are never too many good honest  men of business, ready to do clean big things for the betterment of  humanity and the upbuilding of their country, to plan great enterprises  and carry them through with brain and courage, to manage and control, to  aim high and strike one's aim. There, I'm waxing eloquent, so I'd better  stop. But ambition, man! Why, I'm full of it--it's bubbling in every  pore of me. I mean to make the department store of Marshall & Company  famous from ocean to ocean. Father started in life as a poor boy from  a Nova Scotian farm. He has built up a business that has a provincial  reputation. I mean to carry it on. In five years it shall have a  maritime reputation, in ten, a Canadian. I want to make the firm of  Marshall & Company stand for something big in the commercial interests  of Canada. Isn't that as honourable an ambition as trying to make black  seem white in a court of law, or discovering some new disease with  a harrowing name to torment poor creatures who might otherwise die  peacefully in blissful ignorance of what ailed them?\"    \"When you begin to make poor jokes it is time to stop arguing with you,\"  said David, with a shrug of his fat shoulders. \"Go your own gait and  dree your own weird. I'd as soon expect success in trying to storm the  citadel single-handed as in trying to turn you from any course about  which you had once made up your mind. Whew, this street takes it out of  a fellow! What could have possessed our ancestors to run a town up the  side of a hill? I'm not so slim and active as I was on MY graduation  day ten years ago. By the way, what a lot of co-eds were in your  class--twenty, if I counted right.
