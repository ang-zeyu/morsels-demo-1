A CHRISTMAS DREAM, AND HOW IT CAME TRUE.      \"I'm so tired of Christmas I wish there never would be another one!\"  exclaimed a discontented-looking little girl, as she sat idly watching  her mother arrange a pile of gifts two days before they were to be  given.    \"Why, Effie, what a dreadful thing to say! You are as bad as old  Scrooge; and I'm afraid something will happen to you, as it did to him,  if you don't care for dear Christmas,\" answered mamma, almost dropping  the silver horn she was filling with delicious candies.    \"Who was Scrooge? What happened to him?\" asked Effie, with a glimmer of  interest in her listless face, as she picked out the sourest lemon-drop  she could find; for nothing sweet suited her just then.    \"He was one of Dickens's best people, and you can read the charming  story some day. He hated Christmas until a strange dream showed him how  dear and beautiful it was, and made a better man of him.\"    \"I shall read it; for I like dreams, and have a great many curious ones  myself. But they don't keep me from being tired of Christmas,\" said  Effie, poking discontentedly among the sweeties for something worth  eating.    \"Why are you tired of what should be the happiest time of all the year?\"  asked mamma, anxiously.    \"Perhaps I shouldn't be if I had something new. But it is always the  same, and there isn't any more surprise about it. I always find heaps of  goodies in my stocking. Don't like some of them, and soon get tired of  those I do like. We always have a great dinner, and I eat too much, and  feel ill next day. Then there is a Christmas tree somewhere, with a doll  on top, or a stupid old Santa Claus, and children dancing and screaming  over bonbons and toys that break, and shiny things that are of no use.  Really, mamma, I've had so many Christmases all alike that I don't think  I _can_ bear another one.\" And Effie laid herself flat on the sofa, as  if the mere idea was too much for her.    Her mother laughed at her despair, but was sorry to see her little girl  so discontented, when she had everything to make her happy, and had  known but ten Christmas days.    \"Suppose we don't give you _any_ presents at all,--how would that suit  you?\" asked mamma, anxious to please her spoiled child.    \"I should like one large and splendid one, and one dear little one,  to remember some very nice person by,\" said Effie, who was a fanciful  little body, full of odd whims and notions, which her friends loved to  gratify, regardless of time, trouble, or money; for she was the last of  three little girls, and very dear to all the family.    \"Well, my darling, I will see what I can do to please you, and not say a  word until all is ready. If I could only get a new idea to start with!\"  And mamma went on tying up her pretty bundles with a thoughtful face,  while Effie strolled to the window to watch the rain that kept her  in-doors and made her dismal.    \"Seems to me poor children have better times than rich ones. I can't go  out, and there is a girl about my age splashing along, without any maid  to fuss about rubbers and cloaks and umbrellas and colds. I wish I was a  beggar-girl.\"    \"Would you like to be hungry, cold, and ragged, to beg all day, and  sleep on an ash-heap at night?\" asked mamma, wondering what would come  next.    \"Cinderella did, and had a nice time in the end. This girl out here has  a basket of scraps on her arm, and a big old shawl all round her, and  doesn't seem to care a bit, though the water runs out of the toes of her  boots. She goes paddling along, laughing at the rain, and eating a cold  potato as if it tasted nicer than the chicken and ice-cream I had for  dinner. Yes, I do think poor children are happier than rich ones.\"    \"So do I, sometimes. At the Orphan Asylum today I saw two dozen merry  little souls who have no parents, no home, and no hope of Christmas  beyond a stick of candy or a cake. I wish you had been there to see how  happy they were, playing with the old toys some richer children had sent  them.\"    \"You may give them all mine; I'm so tired of them I never want to  see them again,\" said Effie, turning from the window to the pretty  baby-house full of everything a child's heart could desire.    \"I will, and let you begin again with something you will not tire of,  if I can only find it.\" And mamma knit her brows trying to discover some  grand surprise for this child who didn't care for Christmas.    Nothing more was said then; and wandering off to the library, Effie  found \"A Christmas Carol,\" and curling herself up in the sofa corner,  read it all before tea. Some of it she did not understand; but she  laughed and cried over many parts of the charming story, and felt better  without knowing why.    All the evening she thought of poor Tiny Tim, Mrs. Cratchit with the  pudding, and the stout old gentleman who danced so gayly that \"his legs  twinkled in the air.\" Presently bedtime arrived.    \"Come, now, and toast your feet,\" said Effie's nurse, \"while I do your  pretty hair and tell stories.\"    \"I'll have a fairy tale to-night, a very interesting one,\" commanded  Effie, as she put on her blue silk wrapper and little fur-lined slippers  to sit before the fire and have her long curls brushed.    So Nursey told her best tales; and when at last the child lay down under  her lace curtains, her head was full of a curious jumble of Christmas  elves, poor children, snow-storms, sugarplums, and surprises. So it is  no wonder that she dreamed all night; and this was the dream, which she  never quite forgot.    She found herself sitting on a stone, in the middle of a great field,  all alone. The snow was falling fast, a bitter wind whistled by, and  night was coming on. She felt hungry, cold, and tired, and did not know  where to go nor what to do.    \"I wanted to be a beggar-girl, and now I am one; but I don't like it,  and wish somebody would come and take care of me. I don't know who I am,  and I think I must be lost,\" thought Effie, with the curious interest  one takes in one's self in dreams.    But the more she thought about it, the more bewildered she felt. Faster  fell the snow, colder blew the wind, darker grew the night; and poor  Effie made up her mind that she was quite forgotten and left to freeze  alone. The tears were chilled on her cheeks, her feet felt like icicles,  and her heart died within her, so hungry, frightened, and forlorn was  she. Laying her head on her knees, she gave herself up for lost, and sat  there with the great flakes fast turning her to a little white mound,  when suddenly the sound of music reached her, and starting up, she  looked and listened with all her eyes and ears.    Far away a dim light shone, and a voice was heard singing. She tried  to run toward the welcome glimmer, but could not stir, and stood like a  small statue of expectation while the light drew nearer, and the sweet  words of the song grew clearer.        From our happy home      Through the world we roam    One week in all the year,      Making winter spring      With the joy we bring,    For Christmas-tide is here.        Now the eastern star      Shines from afar    To light the poorest home;      Hearts warmer grow,      Gifts freely flow,    For Christmas-tide has come.        Now gay trees rise      Before young eyes,    Abloom with tempting cheer;      Blithe voices sing,      And blithe bells ring,    For Christmas-tide is here.        Oh, happy chime,      Oh, blessed time,    That draws us all so near!      \"Welcome, dear day,\"      All creatures say,    For Christmas-tide is here.    A child's voice sang, a child's hand carried the little candle; and in  the circle of soft light it shed, Effie saw a pretty child coming to her  through the night and snow. A rosy, smiling creature, wrapped in white  fur, with a wreath of green and scarlet holly on its shining hair, the  magic candle in one hand, and the other outstretched as if to shower  gifts and warmly press all other hands.    Effie forgot to speak as this bright vision came nearer, leaving no  trace of footsteps in the snow, only lighting the way with its little  candle, and filling the air with the music of its song.    \"Dear child, you are lost, and I have come to find you,\" said the  stranger, taking Effie's cold hands in his, with a smile like sunshine,  while every holly berry glowed like a little fire.    \"Do you know me?\" asked Effie, feeling no fear, but a great gladness, at  his coming.    \"I know all children, and go to find them; for this is my holiday, and  I gather them from all parts of the world to be merry with me once a  year.\"    \"Are you an angel?\" asked Effie, looking for the wings.    \"No; I am a Christmas spirit, and live with my mates in a pleasant  place, getting ready for our holiday, when we are let out to roam about  the world, helping make this a happy time for all who will let us in.  Will you come and see how we work?\"    \"I will go anywhere with you. Don't leave me again,\" cried Effie,  gladly.    \"First I will make you comfortable. That is what we love to do. You are  cold, and you shall be warm, hungry, and I will feed you; sorrowful, and  I will make you gay.\"    With a wave of his candle all three miracles were wrought,--for the  snow-flakes turned to a white fur cloak and hood on Effie's head and  shoulders, a bowl of hot soup came sailing to her lips, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"FAIRY TALES    By Anonymous      _COLLECTED BY_ JOSEPH JACOBS          _HOW TO GET INTO THIS BOOK._        _Knock at the Knocker on the Door,      Pull the Bell at the side,_    _Then, if you are very quiet, you will hear a teeny tiny voice say  through the grating \"Take down the Key.\" This you will find at the back:  you cannot mistake it, for it has J.

The present  volume contains only a selection out of some 140, of which I have found  traces in this country. It is probable that many more exist.    A quarter of the tales in this volume, have been collected during the  last ten years or so, and some of them have not been hitherto published.  Up to 1870 it was equally said of France and of Italy, that they  possessed no folk-tales. Yet, within fifteen years from that date, over  1000 tales had been collected in each country. I am hoping that the  present volume may lead to equal activity in this country, and would  earnestly beg any reader of this book who knows of similar tales, to  communicate them, written down as they are told, to me, care of Mr.  Nutt. The only reason, I imagine, why such tales have not hitherto  been brought to light, is the lamentable gap between the governing and  recording classes and the dumb working classes of this country--dumb to  others but eloquent among themselves. It would be no unpatriotic task  to help to bridge over this gulf, by giving a common fund of nursery  literature to all classes of the English people, and, in any case, it  can do no harm to add to the innocent gaiety of the nation.    A word or two as to our title seems necessary. We have called our  stories Fairy Tales though few of them speak of fairies. [Footnote: For  some recent views on fairies and tales _about_ fairies, see Notes.] The  same remark applies to the collection of the Brothers Grimm and to all  the other European collections, which contain exactly the same classes  of tales as ours. Yet our stories are what the little ones mean when  they clamour for \"Fairy Tales,\" and this is the only name which they  give to them. One cannot imagine a child saying, \"Tell us a folk-tale,  nurse,\" or \"Another nursery tale, please, grandma.\" As our book is  intended for the little ones, we have indicated its contents by the name  they use. The words \"Fairy Tales\" must accordingly be taken to  include tales in which occurs something \"fairy,\" something  extraordinary--fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking animals. It must  be taken also to cover tales in which what is extraordinary is the  stupidity of some of the actors. Many of the tales in this volume, as  in similar collections for other European countries, are what the  folklorists call Drolls. They serve to justify the title of Merrie  England, which used to be given to this country of ours, and indicate  unsuspected capacity for fun and humour among the unlettered classes.  The story of Tom Tit Tot, which opens our collection, is unequalled  among all other folk-tales I am acquainted with, for its combined sense  of humour and dramatic power.    The first adjective of our title also needs a similar extension of its  meaning. I have acted on Moliere's principle, and have taken what was  good wherever I could find it. Thus, a couple of these stories have been  found among descendants of English immigrants in America; a couple of  others I tell as I heard them myself in my youth in Australia. One of  the best was taken down from the mouth of an English Gipsy. I have also  included some stories that have only been found in Lowland Scotch.  I have felt justified in doing this, as of the twenty-one folk-tales  contained in Chambers' \"Popular Rhymes of Scotland,\" no less than  sixteen are also to be found in an English form. With the Folk-tale as  with the Ballad, Lowland Scotch may be regarded as simply a dialect  of English, and it is a mere chance whether a tale is extant in one or  other, or both.    I have also rescued and re-told a few Fairy Tales that only exist  now-a-days in the form of ballads. There are certain indications that  the \"common form\" of the English Fairy Tale was the _cante-fable_, a  mixture of narrative and verse of which the most illustrious example in  literature is \"Aucassin et Nicolette.\" In one case I have endeavoured to  retain this form, as the tale in which it occurs, \"Childe Rowland,\"  is mentioned by Shakespeare in _King Lear_, and is probably, as I have  shown, the source of Milton's _Comus_. Late as they have been collected,  some dozen of the tales can be traced back to the sixteenth century, two  of them being quoted by Shakespeare himself.    In the majority of instances I have had largely to rewrite these Fairy  Tales, especially those in dialect, including the Lowland Scotch.  [Footnote: It is perhaps worth remarking that the Brothers Grimm did the  same with their stories. \"Dass der Ausdruck,\" say they in their Preface,  \"und die Ausfuehrung des Einzelnen grossentheils von uns herruehrt,  versteht sich von selbst.\" I may add that many of their stories  were taken from printed sources. In the first volume of Mrs. Hunt's  translation, Nos. 12, 18, 19, 23, 32, 35, 42, 43, 44, 69, 77, 78, 83,  89, are thus derived.] Children, and sometimes those of larger  growth, will not read dialect. I have also had to reduce the flatulent  phraseology of the eighteenth-century chap-books, and to re-write in  simpler style the stories only extant in \"Literary\" English. I have,  however, left a few vulgarisms in the mouths of vulgar people. Children  appreciate the dramatic propriety of this as much as their elders.  Generally speaking, it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse  will speak when she tells Fairy Tales. I am doubtful as to my success in  catching the colloquial-romantic tone appropriate for such narratives,  but the thing had to be done or else my main object, to give a book of  English Fairy Tales which English children will listen to, would have  been unachieved. This book is meant to be read aloud, and not merely  taken in by the eye.    In a few instances I have introduced or changed an incident. I have  never done so, however, without mentioning the fact in the Notes. These  have been relegated to the obscurity of small print and a back place,  while the little ones have been, perhaps unnecessarily, warned off them.  They indicate my sources and give a few references to parallels and  variants which may be of interest to fellow-students of Folk-lore. It  is, perhaps, not necessary to inform readers who are not fellow-students  that the study of Folk-tales has pretensions to be a science. It has its  special terminology, and its own methods of investigation, by which it  is hoped, one of these days, to gain fuller knowledge of the workings  of the popular mind as well as traces of archaic modes of thought and  custom. I hope on some future occasion to treat the subject of  the English Folk-tale on a larger scale and with all the necessary  paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus. I shall then, of course,  reproduce my originals with literal accuracy, and have therefore felt  the more at liberty on the present occasion to make the necessary  deviations from this in order to make the tales readable for children.    Finally, I have to thank those by whose kindness in waiving their rights  to some of these stories, I have been enabled to compile this book. My  friends Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. F. Hindes Groome, and Mr. Andrew Lang,  have thus yielded up to me some of the most attractive stories in  the following pages. The Councils of the English and of the American  Folk-lore Societies, and Messrs. Longmans, have also been equally  generous. Nor can I close these remarks without a word of thanks and  praise to the artistic skill with which my friend, Mr. J. D. Batten, has  made the romance and humour of these stories live again in the brilliant  designs with which he has adorned these pages. It should be added that  the dainty headpieces to \"Henny Penny\" and \"Mr. Fox\" are due to my old  friend, Mr. Henry Ryland.    JOSEPH JACOBS.        CONTENTS    I. TOM TIT TOT II.
