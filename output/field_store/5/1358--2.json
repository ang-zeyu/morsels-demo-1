Piccardus.    \"Timbuctoo travels, voyages to the poles,  Are ways to benefit mankind as true  Perhaps as shooting them at Waterloo.\"--Don Juan.        Trieste, Jan. 31, 1875. My Dear Sir George,    Our paths in life have been separated by a long interval. Whilst  inclination led you to explore and to'survey the wild wastes of  the North, the Arctic shores and the Polar seas, with all their  hardships and horrors; my lot was cast in the torrid regions of  Sind and Arabia; in the luxuriant deserts of Africa, and in the  gorgeous tropical forests of the Brazil. But the true traveller  can always appreciate the record of another's experience, and  perhaps the force of contrast makes him most enjoy the adventures  differing the most from his own. To whom, then, more  appropriately than to yourself, a discoverer of no ordinary note,  a recorder of explorations, and, finally, an earnest labourer in  the cause of geography, can I inscribe this plain, unvarnished  tale of a soldier-traveller? Kindly accept the trifle as a token  of the warmest esteem, an earnest of my thankfulness for the  interest ever shown by you in forwarding my plans and projects of  adventure; and, in the heartfelt hope that Allah may prolong your  days, permit me to subscribe myself,    Your sincere admirer and grateful friend, RICHARD F. BURTON.    Admiral Sir George Back, D.C.L., F.R.S.,  Vice-Pres. R.G.S., &c.            Preface.        The notes which form the ground-work of these volumes have long  been kept in the obscurity of manuscript: my studies of South  America, of Syria and Palestine, of Iceland, and of Istria, left  me scant time for the labour of preparation. Leisure and  opportunity have now offered themselves, and I avail myself of  them in the hope that the publication will be found useful to  more than one class of readers. The many who take an interest in  the life of barbarous peoples may not be displeased to hear more  about the Fán; and the few who would try a fall with Mister  Gorilla can learn from me how to equip themselves, whence to set  out and whither to go for the best chance. Travelling with M.  Paul B. du Chaillu's \"First Expedition\" in my hand, I jealously  looked into every statement, and his numerous friends will be  pleased to see how many of his assertions are confirmed by my  experience.    The second part is devoted to the Nzadi or lower Congo River,  from the mouth to the Yellala or main rapids, the gate by which  the mighty stream, emerging from the plateau of Inner Africa,  goes to its long home, the Atlantic. Some time must elapse before  the second expedition, which left Ambriz early in 1873, under  Lieutenant Grandy, R. N., can submit its labours to the public:  meanwhile these pages will, I trust, form a suitable introduction  to the gallant explorer's travel in the interior. It would be  preposterous to publish descriptions of any European country from  information gathered ten years ago. But Africa moves slowly, and  thus we see that the results of an Abyssinian journey (M. Antoine  d'Abbadie's \"Géodésic d'Ethiopie,\" which took place about 1845,  are not considered obsolete in 1873.    After a languid conviction during the last half century of owning  some ground upon the West Coast of Africa, England has been  rudely aroused by a little war which will have large  consequences. The causes that led to the \"Ashantee Campaign,\" a  negro copy of the negroid Abyssinian, may be broadly laid down as  general incuriousness, local mismanagement, and the operation of  unprincipled journalism.    It is not a little amusing to hear the complaints of the public  that plain truth about the African has not been told. I could  cite more than one name that has done so. But what was the  result? We were all soundly abused by the negrophile; the  multitude cared little about reading \"unpopular opinions;\" and  then, when the fulness of time came, it turned upon us, and rent  us, and asked why we had not spoken freely concerning Ashanti and  Fanti, and all the herd. My \"Wanderings in West Africa\" is a case  in point: so little has it been read, that a President of the  Royal Geographical Society (African section of the Society of  Arts Journal, Feb. 6, 1874) could state, \"If Fantees are cowardly  and lazy, Krumen are brave;\" the latter being the most notorious  poltroons on the West African seaboard.    The hostilities on the Gold Coast might have been averted with  honour to ourselves at any time between 1863 and 1870, by a  Colonial Office mission and a couple of thousand pounds. I need  hardly say what has been the case now. The first steps were taken  with needless disasters, and the effect has been far different  from what we intended or what was advisable. For a score of years  we (travellers) have been advising the English statesman not to  despise the cunning of barbarous tribes, never to attempt  finessing with Asiatic or African; to treat these races with  perfect sincerity and truthfulness. I have insisted, and it is  now seen with what reason, that every attempt at deception, at  asserting the \"thing which is not,\" will presently meet with the  reward it deserves. I can only regret that my counsels have not  made themselves heard.    Yet this ignoble war between barbarous tribes whom it has long  been the fashion to pet, this poor scuffle between the  breechloader and the Birmingham trade musket, may yet in one  sense do good. It must perforce draw public attention to the West  Coast of Africa, and raise the question, \"What shall we do with  it?\" My humble opinion, expressed early in 1865 to the Right  Honourable Mr. Adderley, has ever been this. If we are determined  not to follow the example of the French, the Dutch, the  Portuguese, and the Spaniards, and not to use the country as a  convict station, resolving to consume, as it were, our crime at  home, we should also resolve to retain only a few ports and  forts, without territory, at points commanding commerce, after  the fashion of the Lusitanians in the old heroic days. The export  slave-trade is now dead and buried; the want of demand must  prevent its revival; and free emigration has yet to be created.  As Mr. Bright rightly teaches, strong places and garrisons are  not necessary to foster trade and to promote the success of  missions. The best proof on the West African Coast is to be found  in the so-called Oil Rivers, where we have never held a mile of  ground, and where our commerce prospers most. The great \"Tribune\"  will forgive my agreeing in opinion with him when he finds that  we differ upon one most important point. It is the merchant, not  the garrison, that causes African wars. If the home authorities  would avoid a campaign, let them commit their difficulty to a  soldier, not to a civilian.    The chronic discontent of the so-called \"civilized\" African, the  contempt of the rulers if not of the rule, and the bitter hatred  between the three races, white, black, and black-white, fomented  by many an unprincipled print, which fills its pocket with coin  of cant and Christian charity, will end in even greater scandals  than the last disreputable war. If the damnosa licentia be not  suppressed--and where are the strong hands to suppress it?--we  may expect to see the scenes of Jamaica revived with improvements  at Sierra Leone. However unwilling I am to cut off any part of  our great and extended empire, to renew anywhere, even in Africa,  the process of dismemberment--the policy which cast off Corfu--it  is evident to me that English occupation of the West African  Coast has but slightly forwarded the cause of humanity, and that  upon the whole it has proved a remarkable failure.    We can be wise in time.    Richard F. Burton.    P.S.--Since these pages were written, a name which frequently  occurs in them has become a memory to his friends--I allude to W.  Winwood Reade, and I deplore his loss. The highest type of  Englishman, brave and fearless as he was gentle and loving, his  short life of thirty-seven years shows how much may be done by  the honest, thorough worker. He had emphatically the courage of  his opinions, and he towered a cubit above the crowd by telling  not only the truth, as most of us do, but the whole truth, which  so few can afford to do. His personal courage in battle during  the Ashanti campaign, where the author of \"Savage Africa\" became  correspondent of the \"Times,\" is a matter of history. His noble  candour in publishing the \"Martyrdom of Man\" is an example and a  model to us who survive him. And he died calmly and courageously  as he lived, died in harness, died as he had resolved to die,  like the good and gallant gentleman of ancient lineage that he  was.

During the hot season of 1863, \"Nanny Po,\" as the civilized  African calls this \"lofty and beautiful island,\" had become a  charnel-house, a \"dark and dismal tomb of Europeans.\" The yellow  fever of the last year, which wiped out in two months one-third  of the white colony--more exactly, 78 out of 250--had not  reappeared, but the conditions for its re-appearance were highly  favourable. The earth was all water, the vegetation all slime,  the air half steam, and the difference between wet and dry bulbs  almost nil. Thoroughly dispirited for the first time, I was  meditating how to escape, when H. M. Steamship \"Torch\" steamed  into Clarence Cove, and Commander Smith hospitably offered me a  passage down south. To hear was to accept. Two days afterwards  (July 29, 1863) I bade a temporary \"adios\" to the enemy.    The bitterness of death remained behind as we passed out of the  baneful Bights. Wind and wave were dead against us, yet I greatly  enjoyed the gradual emerging of the sun through his shroud of  \"smokes;\" the increasing consciousness that a moon and stars  really exist; the soft blue haze of the sky, and the coolness of  73° F. at 6 A.M. in the captain's cabin. I had also time to enjoy  these charms. The \"Torch\" was not provided with \"despatch-  boilers:\" she was profoundly worm-eaten, and a yard of copper,  occasionally clapped on, did not prevent her making some four  feet of water a day. So we rolled leisurely along the well-known  Gaboon shore, and faintly sighted from afar Capes Lopez and St.  Catherine, and the fringing ranges of Mayumba-land, a blue line  of heights based upon gently rising banks, ruddy and white,  probably of shaly clay. The seventh day (August 5) placed us off  the well-known \"red hills\" of Loango-land.    The country looks high and bold after the desperate flatness of  the Bights, and we note with pleasure that we have left behind us  the \"impervious luxuriance of vegetation which crowns the  lowlands, covers the sides of the rises, and caps their summits.\"  During the rains after October the grass, now showing yellow  stubble upon the ruddy, rusty plain, becomes a cane fence, ten to  twelve feet tall; but instead of matted, felted jungle, knitted  together by creepers of cable size, we have scattered clumps of  dark, lofty, and broad-topped trees. A nearer view shows great  cliffs, weather-worked into ravines and basins, ribs and ridges,  towers and pinnacles. Above them is a joyful open land,  apparently disposed in two successive dorsa or steps, with bright  green tiers and terraces between, and these are pitted with the  crater-like sinks locally called \"holes,\" so frequent in the  Gaboon country. Southwards the beauty of eternal verdure will  end, and the land will become drier, and therefore better fitted  for Europeans, the nearer it approaches Mossamedes Bay. South of  \"Little Fish,\" again, a barren tract of white sand will show the  \"Last Tree,\" an inhospitable region, waterless, and bulwarked by  a raging sea.    Loango is a \"pool harbour,\" like the ancient Portus Lemanus  (Hythe), a spit of shingle, whose bay, north-east and south-west,  forms an inner lagoon, bounded landwards by conspicuous and  weather-tarnished red cliffs. This \"lingula\" rests upon a base of  terra firma whose westernmost projection is Indian Point. From  the latter runs northwards the \"infamous\" Indian Bar, compared by  old sailors with a lengthened Bill of Portland; a reef some three  miles long, which the waves assault with prodigious fury; a  terror to slavers, especially in our autumn, when the squalls and  storms begin. The light sandy soil of the mainland rests upon  compact clay, and malaria rises only where the little drains,  which should feed the lagoon, evaporate in swamps. Here and there  are clumps of tall cocoas, a capot, pullom or wild cotton-tree,  and a neat village upon prairie land, where stone is rare as on  the Pampas. Southwards the dry tract falls into low and wooded  ground.    The natural basin, entered by the north-east, is upwards of a  mile in length, and the narrow, ever-shifting mouth is garnished  with rocks, the sea breaking right across. Gunboats have floated  over during the rains, but at dead low water in the dry season we  would not risk the gig. Guided by a hut upon the beach fronting  French Factory and under lee of the breakers off Indian Bar, I  landed near a tree-motte, in a covelet smoothed by a succession  of sandpits. The land sharks flocked down to drag the boat over  the breakwater of shingle. They appeared small and effeminate  after the burly negroes of the Bights, and their black but not  comely persons were clad in red and white raiment. It is a tribe  of bumboat men, speaking a few words of English, French, and  Portuguese, and dealing in mats and pumpkins, parrots, and  poultry, cages, and Fetish dolls called \"idols.\"    Half a mile of good sandy path led to the English Factory, built  upon a hill giving a charming view. To the south-east, and some  three miles inland from the centre of the bay, we were shown  \"Looboo Wood,\" a thick motte conspicuously crowning a ridge, and  forming a first-rate landmark. Its shades once sheltered the  nyáre, locally called buffalo, the gorilla, and perhaps the more  monstrous \"impungu\" (mpongo). Eastward of the Factory appears  Chomfuku, the village of Jim Potter, with a tree-clad sink,  compared by old voyagers with \"the large chalkpit on Portsdown  Hill,\" and still much affected by picnickers. At Loanghili, or  Loanguilli, south of Looboo Wood, and upon the right bank of a  streamlet which trickles to the sea, is the cemetery, where the  kings are buried in gun-boxes.    The Ma-Loango (for mwani, \"lord\" of Loango), the great despot who  ruled as far as the Congo River, who used to eat in one house,  drink in another, and put to death man or beast that saw him  feeding, is a thing of the past. Yet five miles to the eastward  (here held to be a day's march) King Monoyambi governs \"big  Loango town,\" whose modern native name, I was told, is Mangamwár.  He shows his power chiefly by forbidding strangers to enter the  interior.    The Factory (Messrs. Hatton and Cookson) was a poor affair of  bamboos and mats, with partition-walls of the same material, and  made pestilent by swamps to landward. Little work was then doing  in palm oil, and the copper mines of the interior had ceased to  send supplies. We borrowed hammocks to cross the swamps, and we  found French Factory a contrast not very satisfactory to our  insular pride. M. Charles de Gourlet, of the Maison Régis, was  living, not in a native hut lacking all the necessaries of  civilized man, but in a double-storied stone house, with  barracoons, hospital, public room, orchestra, and so forth,  intended for the \"emigrants.\" Instead of water, the employés had  excellent cognac and vermouth, and a succulent cuisine replaced  the poor Britishers' two barrels of flour and biscuit. No wonder  that in our half-starved fellow countrymen we saw little of the  \"national failing, a love of extravagant adventure.\" The  Frenchmen shoot, or at least go out shooting, twice a week, they  walk to picnics, learn something of the language, and see  something of the country. They had heard a native tradition of  Mr. Gorilla's \"big brother,\" but they could give no details.    I will conclude this chapter with a notice of what has taken  place on the Loango Coast a decade after my departure."]]]
