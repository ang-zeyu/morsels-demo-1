Some adaptations from the  original text were made to format it into an e-text. Italics in the  original book are capitalized in this e-text, except for most foreign  language phrases that were italicized. Original footnotes are put in  brackets \"[]\" at the points where they are cited in the text. Some  spellings were altered. \"To-day\" and \"To-morrow\" are spelled \"today\"  and \"tomorrow.\" Some words containing the letters \"ise\" in the original  text, such as \"idealise,\" had these letters changed to \"ize,\" such as  \"idealize.\" \"Sceptic\" was changed to \"skeptic.\"      TABLE OF CONTENTS        PREFACE      BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL        CHAPTER I:    PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS      CHAPTER II:   THE FREE SPIRIT      CHAPTER III:  THE RELIGIOUS MOOD      CHAPTER IV:   APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES      CHAPTER V:    THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS      CHAPTER VI:   WE SCHOLARS      CHAPTER VII:  OUR VIRTUES      CHAPTER VIII: PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES      CHAPTER IX:   WHAT IS NOBLE?        FROM THE HEIGHTS (POEM TRANSLATED BY L.A. MAGNUS)          PREFACE      SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman--what then? Is there not ground  for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been  dogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible  seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid  their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for  winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and  at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF,  indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it  has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay more, that it is at  its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping  that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive  and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism  and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once  and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such  imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have  hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time  (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and  ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some  play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an  audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very  human--all-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to  be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was  astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more  labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any  actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its \"super-terrestrial\"  pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems  that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with  everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the  earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has  been a caricature of this kind--for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in  Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although  it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome,  and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist  error--namely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself.  But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare,  can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleep,  we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength  which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to  the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE--the  fundamental condition--of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato  spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"How did such a  malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked  Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of  youths, and deserved his hemlock?\" But the struggle against Plato,  or--to speak plainer, and for the \"people\"--the struggle against  the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR  CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE \"PEOPLE\"), produced in Europe  a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere  previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the  furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as  a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to  unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means  of democratic enlightenment--which, with the aid of liberty of the press  and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit  would not so easily find itself in \"distress\"! (The Germans invented  gunpowder--all credit to them! but they again made things square--they  invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats,  nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free  spirits--we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the  tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who  knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....    Sils Maria Upper Engadine, JUNE, 1885.          CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS      1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous  enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have  hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not  laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is  already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is  it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn  impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions  ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really  is this \"Will to Truth\" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the  question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an  absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired  about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT  RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the  value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented  ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which  the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of  interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as  if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first  to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk  in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.    2. \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth  out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the  generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the  wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams  of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest  value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this  transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of  delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in  the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the  'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!\"--This  mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which  metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation  is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this \"belief\" of  theirs, they exert themselves for their \"knowledge,\" for something that  is in the end solemnly christened \"the Truth.\" The fundamental belief of  metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred  even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where  doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn  vow, \"DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.\" For it may be doubted, firstly, whether  antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations  and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their  seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional  perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from  below--\"frog perspectives,\" as it were, to borrow an expression current  among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true,  the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher  and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to  pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It  might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and  respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously  related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed  things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!  But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous \"Perhapses\"!  For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of  philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the  reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous  \"Perhaps\" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I  see such new philosophers beginning to appear.    3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between  their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of  conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and  it is so even in the case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#1)"],[1,"MEMOIRS OF U. S. GRANT, complete    by U. S. Grant          PREFACE.    \"Man proposes and God disposes.\"  There are but few important events in  the affairs of men brought about by their own choice.    Although frequently urged by friends to write my memoirs I had  determined never to do so, nor to write anything for publication.  At  the age of nearly sixty-two I received an injury from a fall, which  confined me closely to the house while it did not apparently affect my  general health. This made study a pleasant pastime.  Shortly after, the  rascality of a business partner developed itself by the announcement of  a failure.  This was followed soon after by universal depression of all  securities, which seemed to threaten the extinction of a good part of  the income still retained, and for which I am indebted to the kindly act  of friends.  At this juncture the editor of the Century Magazine asked  me to write a few articles for him. I consented for the money it gave  me; for at that moment I was living upon borrowed money.  The work I  found congenial, and I determined to continue it.  The event is an  important one for me, for good or evil; I hope for the former.    In preparing these volumes for the public, I have entered upon the task  with the sincere desire to avoid doing injustice to any one, whether on  the National or Confederate side, other than the unavoidable injustice  of not making mention often where special mention is due.  There must be  many errors of omission in this work, because the subject is too large  to be treated of in two volumes in such way as to do justice to all the  officers and men engaged.  There were thousands of instances, during the  rebellion, of individual, company, regimental and brigade deeds of  heroism which deserve special mention and are not here alluded to.  The  troops engaged in them will have to look to the detailed reports of  their individual commanders for the full history of those deeds.    The first volume, as well as a portion of the second, was written before  I had reason to suppose I was in a critical condition of health.  Later  I was reduced almost to the point of death, and it became impossible for  me to attend to anything for weeks.  I have, however, somewhat regained  my strength, and am able, often, to devote as many hours a day as a  person should devote to such work.  I would have more hope of satisfying  the expectation of the public if I could have allowed myself more time.  I have used my best efforts, with the aid of my eldest son, F. D. Grant,  assisted by his brothers, to verify from the records every statement of  fact given.  The comments are my own, and show how I saw the matters  treated of whether others saw them in the same light or not.    With these remarks I present these volumes to the public, asking no  favor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader.    U. S.  GRANT.    MOUNT MACGREGOR, NEW YORK, July 1, 1885.

ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.    My family is American, and has been for generations, in all its  branches, direct and collateral.    Mathew Grant, the founder of the branch in America, of which I am a  descendant, reached Dorchester, Massachusetts, in May, 1630.  In 1635 he  moved to what is now Windsor, Connecticut, and was the surveyor for that  colony for more than forty years.  He was also, for many years of the  time, town clerk.  He was a married man when he arrived at Dorchester,  but his children were all born in this country.  His eldest son, Samuel,  took lands on the east side of the Connecticut River, opposite Windsor,  which have been held and occupied by descendants of his to this day.    I am of the eighth generation from Mathew Grant, and seventh from  Samuel.  Mathew Grant's first wife died a few years after their  settlement in Windsor, and he soon after married the widow Rockwell,  who, with her first husband, had been fellow-passengers with him and his  first wife, on the ship Mary and John, from Dorchester, England, in  1630.  Mrs. Rockwell had several children by her first marriage, and  others by her second.  By intermarriage, two or three generations later,  I am descended from both the wives of Mathew Grant.    In the fifth descending generation my great grandfather, Noah Grant, and  his younger brother, Solomon, held commissions in the English army, in  1756, in the war against the French and Indians.  Both were killed that  year.    My grandfather, also named Noah, was then but nine"]]]
