The special subject of the greater part of the letters and essays of  Schiller contained in this volume is Aesthetics; and before passing to  any remarks on his treatment of the subject it will be useful to offer a  few observations on the nature of this topic, and on its treatment by the  philosophical spirit of different ages.    First, then, aesthetics has for its object the vast realm of the  beautiful, and it may be most adequately defined as the philosophy of art  or of the fine arts. To some the definition may seem arbitrary, as  excluding the beautiful in nature; but it will cease to appear so if it  is remarked that the beauty which is the work of art is higher than  natural beauty, because it is the offspring of the mind. Moreover, if,  in conformity with a certain school of modern philosophy, the mind be  viewed as the true being, including all in itself, it must be admitted  that beauty is only truly beautiful when it shares in the nature of mind,  and is mind's offspring.    Viewed in this light, the beauty of nature is only a reflection of the  beauty of the mind, only an imperfect beauty, which as to its essence is  included in that of the mind. Nor has it ever entered into the mind of  any thinker to develop the beautiful in natural objects, so as to convert  it into a science and a system. The field of natural beauty is too  uncertain and too fluctuating for this purpose. Moreover, the relation  of beauty in nature and beauty in art forms a part of the science of  aesthetics, and finds again its proper place.    But it may be urged that art is not worthy of a scientific treatment.  Art is no doubt an ornament of our life and a charm to the fancy; but has  it a more serious side? When compared with the absorbing necessities of  human existence, it might seem a luxury, a superfluity, calculated to  enfeeble the heart by the assiduous worship of beauty, and thus to be  actually prejudicial to the true interest of practical life. This view  seems to be largely countenanced by a dominant party in modern times, and  practical men, as they are styled, are only too ready to take this  superficial view of the office of art.    Many have indeed undertaken to defend art on this score, and to show  that, far from being a mere luxury, it has serious and solid advantages.  It has been even apparently exaggerated in this respect, and represented  as a kind of mediator between reason and sense, between inclination and  duty, having as its mission the work of reconciling the conflicting  elements in the human heart. A strong trace of this view will be found  in Schiller, especially in all that he says about the play-instinct in  his \"Aesthetical Letters.\"    Nevertheless, art is worthy of science; aesthetics is a true science, and  the office of art is as high as that assigned to it in the pages of  Schiller. We admit that art viewed only as an ornament and a charm is no  longer free, but a slave. But this is a perversion of its proper end.  Science has to be considered as free in its aim and in its means, and it  is only free when liberated from all other considerations; it rises up to  truth, which is its only real object, and can alone fully satisfy it.  Art in like manner is alone truly art when it is free and independent,  when it solves the problem of its high destination--that problem whether  it has to be placed beside religion and philosophy as being nothing else  than a particular mode or a special form of revealing God to  consciousness, and of expressing the deepest interests of human nature  and the widest truths of the human mind.    For it is in their works of art that the nations have imprinted their  favorite thoughts and their richest intuitions, and not unfrequently the  fine arts are the only means by which we can penetrate into the secrets  of their wisdom and the mysteries of their religion.    It is made a reproach to art that it produces its effects by appearance  and illusion; but can it be established that appearance is objectionable?  The phenomena of nature and the acts of human life are nothing more than  appearances, and are yet looked upon as constituting a true reality; for  this reality must be sought for beyond the objects perceived immediately  by the sense, the substance and speech and principle underlying all  things manifesting itself in time and space through these real  existences, but preserving its absolute existence in itself. Now, the  very special object and aim of art is to represent the action and  development of this universal force. In nature this force or principle  appears confounded with particular interests and transitory  circumstances, mixed up with what is arbitrary in the passions and in  individual wills. Art sets the truth free from the illusory and  mendacious forms of this coarse, imperfect world, and clothes it in a  nobler, purer form created by the mind itself. Thus the forms of art,  far from being mere appearances, perfectly illusory, contain more reality  and truth than the phenomenal existences of the real world. The world of  art is truer than that of history or nature.    Nor is this all: the representations of art are more expressive and  transparent than the phenomena of the real world or the events of  history. The mind finds it harder to pierce through the hard envelop of  nature and common life than to penetrate into works of art.    Two more reflections appear completely to meet the objection that art or  aesthetics is not entitled to the name of science.    It will be generally admitted that the mind of man has the power of  considering itself, of making itself its own object and all that issues  from its activity; for thought constitutes the essence of the mind. Now  art and its work, as creations of the mind, are themselves of a spiritual  nature. In this respect art is much nearer to the mind than nature. In  studying the works of art the mind has to do with itself, with what  proceeds from itself, and is itself.    Thus art finds its highest confirmation in science.    Nor does art refuse a philosophical treatment because it is dependent on  caprice, and subject to no law. If its highest aim be to reveal to the  human consciousness the highest interest of the mind, it is evident that  the substance or contents of the representations are not given up to the  control of a wild and irregular imagination. It is strictly determined  by the ideas that concern our intelligence and by the laws of their  development, whatever may be the inexhaustible variety of forms in which  they are produced. Nor are these forms arbitrary, for every form is not  fitted to express every idea. The form is determined by the substance  which it has to suit.    A further consideration of the true nature of beauty, and therefore of  the vocation of the artist, will aid us still more in our endeavor to  show the high dignity of art and of aesthetics. The history of  philosophy presents us with many theories on the nature of the beautiful;  but as it would lead us too far to examine them all, we shall only  consider the most important among them. The coarsest of these theories  defines the beautiful as that which pleases the senses. This theory,  issuing from the philosophy of sensation of the school of Locke and  Condillac, only explains the idea and the feeling of the beautiful by  disfiguring it. It is entirely contradicted by facts. For it converts  it into desire, but desire is egotistical and insatiable, while  admiration is respectful, and is its own satisfaction without seeking  possession.    Others have thought the beautiful consists in proportion, and no  doubt this is one of the conditions of beauty, but only one. An  ill-proportioned object cannot be beautiful, but the exact correspondence  of parts, as in geometrical figures, does not constitute beauty.    A noted ancient theory makes beauty consist in the perfect suitableness  of means to their end. In this case the beautiful is not the useful, it  is the suitable; and the latter idea is more akin to that of beauty. But  it has not the true character of the beautiful. Again, order is a less  mathematical idea than proportion, but it does not explain what is free  and flowing in certain beauties.    The most plausible theory of beauty is that which makes it consist in two  contrary and equally necessary elements--unity and variety. A beautiful  flower has all the elements we have named; it has unity, symmetry, and  variety of shades of color. There is no beauty without life, and life is  movement, diversity. These elements are found in beautiful and also in  sublime objects. A beautiful object is complete, finished, limited with  symmetrical parts. A sublime object whose forms, though not out of  proportion, are less determined, ever awakens in us the feeling of the  infinite. In objects of sense all qualities that can produce the feeling  of the beautiful come under one class called physical beauty. But above  and beyond this in the region of mind we have first intellectual beauty,  including the laws that govern intelligence and the creative genius of  the artist, the poet, and the philosopher. Again, the moral world has  beauty in its ideas of liberty, of virtue, of devotion, the justice of  Aristides, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#1)"],[1,"of Mars      By    Edgar Rice Burroughs            CONTENTS      On the River Iss    Under the Mountains    The Temple of the Sun    The Secret Tower    On the Kaolian Road    A Hero in Kaol    New Allies    Through the Carrion Caves    With the Yellow Men    In Durance    The Pit of Plenty    \"Follow the Rope!\"    The Magnet Switch    The Tide of Battle    Rewards    The New Ruler            ON THE RIVER ISS      In the shadows of the forest that flanks the crimson plain by the  side of the Lost Sea of Korus in the Valley Dor, beneath the hurtling  moons of Mars, speeding their meteoric way close above the bosom of  the dying planet, I crept stealthily along the trail of a shadowy  form that hugged the darker places with a persistency that proclaimed  the sinister nature of its errand.    For six long Martian months I had haunted the vicinity of the  hateful Temple of the Sun, within whose slow-revolving shaft, far  beneath the surface of Mars, my princess lay entombed--but whether  alive or dead I knew not.  Had Phaidor's slim blade found that  beloved heart?  Time only would reveal the truth.    Six hundred and eighty-seven Martian days must come and go before  the cell's door would again come opposite the tunnel's end where  last I had seen my ever-beautiful Dejah Thoris.    Half of them had passed, or would on the morrow, yet vivid in my  memory, obliterating every event that had come before or after,  there remained the last scene before the gust of smoke blinded my  eyes and the narrow slit that had given me sight of the interior  of her cell closed between me and the Princess of Helium for a long  Martian year.    As if it were yesterday, I still saw the beautiful face of Phaidor,  daughter of Matai Shang, distorted with jealous rage and hatred as  she sprang forward with raised dagger upon the woman I loved.    I saw the red girl, Thuvia of Ptarth, leap forward to prevent the  hideous deed.    The smoke from the burning temple had come then to blot out the  tragedy, but in my ears rang the single shriek as the knife fell.  Then silence, and when the smoke had cleared, the revolving temple  had shut off all sight or sound from the chamber in which the three  beautiful women were imprisoned.    Much there had been to occupy my attention since that terrible moment;  but never for an instant had the memory of the thing faded, and  all the time that I could spare from the numerous duties that had  devolved upon me in the reconstruction of the government of the  First Born since our victorious fleet and land forces had overwhelmed  them, had been spent close to the grim shaft that held the mother  of my boy, Carthoris of Helium.    The race of blacks that for ages had worshiped Issus, the false  deity of Mars, had been left in a state of chaos by my revealment  of her as naught more than a wicked old woman.  In their rage they  had torn her to pieces.    From the high pinnacle of their egotism the First Born had been  plunged to the depths of humiliation.  Their deity was gone, and  with her the whole false fabric of their religion.  Their vaunted  navy had fallen in defeat before the superior ships and fighting  men of the red men of Helium.    Fierce green warriors from the ocher sea bottoms of outer Mars had  ridden their wild thoats across the sacred gardens of the Temple  of Issus, and Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, fiercest of them all,  had sat upon the throne of Issus and ruled the First Born while  the allies were deciding the conquered nation's fate.    Almost unanimous was the request that I ascend the ancient throne  of the black men, even the First Born themselves concurring in it;  but I would have none of it.  My heart could never be with the race  that had heaped indignities upon my princess and my son.    At my suggestion Xodar became Jeddak of the First Born.  He had  been a dator, or prince, until Issus had degraded him, so that his  fitness for the high office bestowed was unquestioned.    The peace of the Valley Dor thus assured, the green warriors dispersed  to their desolate sea bottoms, while we of Helium returned to our  own country.  Here again was a throne offered me, since no word  had been received from the missing Jeddak of Helium, Tardos Mors,  grandfather of Dejah Thoris, or his son, Mors Kajak, Jed of Helium,  her father.    Over a year had elapsed since they had set out to explore the northern  hemisphere in search of Carthoris, and at last their disheartened  people had accepted as truth the vague rumors of their death that  had filtered in from the frozen region of the pole.    Once again I refused a throne, for I would not believe that the  mighty Tardos Mors, or his no less redoubtable son, was dead.    \"Let one of their own blood rule you until they return,\" I said  to the assembled nobles of Helium, as I addressed them from the  Pedestal of Truth beside the Throne of Righteousness in the Temple  of Reward, from the very spot where I had stood a year before when  Zat Arras pronounced the sentence of death upon me.    As I spoke I stepped forward and laid my hand upon the shoulder of  Carthoris where he stood in the front rank of the circle of nobles  about me.    As one, the nobles and the people lifted their voices in a long  cheer of approbation.  Ten thousand swords sprang on high from as  many scabbards, and the glorious fighting men of ancient Helium  hailed Carthoris Jeddak of Helium.    His tenure of office was to be for life or until his great-grandfather,  or grandfather, should return.  Having thus satisfactorily arranged  this important duty for Helium, I started the following day for  the Valley Dor that I might remain close to the Temple of the Sun  until the fateful day that should see the opening of the prison  cell where my lost love lay buried.    Hor Vastus and Kantos Kan, with my other noble lieutenants, I left  with Carthoris at Helium, that he might have the benefit of their  wisdom, bravery, and loyalty in the performance of the arduous  duties which had devolved upon him.  Only Woola, my Martian hound,  accompanied me.    At my heels tonight the faithful beast moved softly in my tracks.  As large as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs,  he was indeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his  ten short, muscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love  and loyalty.    The figure ahead was that of the black dator of the First Born,  Thurid, whose undying enmity I had earned that time I laid him low  with my bare hands in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus, and  bound him with his own harness before the noble men and women who  had but a moment before been extolling his prowess.    Like many of his fellows, he had apparently accepted the new order  of things with good grace, and had sworn fealty to Xodar, his new  ruler; but I knew that he hated me, and I was sure that in his heart  he envied and hated Xodar, so I had kept a watch upon his comings  and goings, to the end that of late I had become convinced that he  was occupied with some manner of intrigue.    Several times I had observed him leaving the walled city of the  First Born after dark, taking his way out into the cruel and horrible  Valley Dor, where no honest business could lead any man.    Tonight he moved quickly along the edge of the forest until well  beyond sight or sound of the city, then he turned across the crimson  sward toward the shore of the Lost Sea of Korus.    The rays of the nearer moon, swinging low across the valley, touched  his jewel-incrusted harness with a thousand changing lights and  glanced from the glossy ebony of his smooth hide.  Twice he turned  his head back toward the forest, after the manner of one who is upon  an evil errand, though he must have felt quite safe from pursuit.    I did not dare follow him there beneath the moonlight, since it  best suited my plans not to interrupt his--I wished him to reach  his destination unsuspecting, that I might learn just where that  destination lay and the business that awaited the night prowler  there.    So it was that I remained hidden until after Thurid had disappeared  over the edge of the steep bank beside the sea a quarter of a mile  away.  Then, with Woola following, I hastened across the open after  the black dator.    The quiet of the tomb lay upon the mysterious valley of death,  crouching deep in its warm nest within the sunken area at the south  pole of the dying planet.  In the far distance the Golden Cliffs  raised their mighty barrier faces far into the starlit heavens,  the precious metals and scintillating jewels that composed them  sparkling in the brilliant light of Mars's two gorgeous moons.    At my back was the forest, pruned and trimmed like the sward to  parklike symmetry by the browsing of the ghoulish plant men.    Before me lay the Lost Sea of Korus, while farther on I caught the  shimmering ribbon of Iss, the River of Mystery, where it wound out  from beneath the Golden Cliffs to empty into Korus, to which for  countless ages had been borne the deluded and unhappy Martians of  the outer world upon the voluntary pilgrimage to this false heaven.    The plant men, with their blood-sucking hands, and the monstrous  white apes that make Dor hideous by day, were hidden in their lairs  for the night.    There was no longer a Holy Thern upon the balcony in the Golden  Cliffs above the Iss to summon them with weird cry to the victims  floating down to their maws upon the cold, broad bosom of ancient  Iss.    The navies of Helium and the First Born had cleared the fortresses  and the temples of the therns when they had refused to surrender and  accept the new order of things that had swept their false religion  from long-suffering Mars.    In a few isolated countries they still retained their age-old power;  but Matai Shang, their hekkador, Father of Therns, had been driven  from his temple.  Strenuous had been our endeavors to capture  him; but with a"]]]
