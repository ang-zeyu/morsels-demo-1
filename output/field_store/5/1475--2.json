Of the first class, the keen and regular player, little need be said.  A keen player is a gem of purest rays serene, and when to his keenness  he adds regularity and punctuality, life ceases to become the mere  hollow blank that it would otherwise become, and joy reigns supreme.    The absolute slacker (to take the worst at once, and have done with  it) needs the pen of a Swift before adequate justice can be done to  his enormities. He is a blot, an excrescence. All those moments which  are not spent in avoiding games (by means of that leave which is  unanimously considered the peculiar property of the French nation) he  uses in concocting ingenious excuses. Armed with these, he faces with  calmness the disgusting curiosity of the Game-Captain, who officiously  desires to know the reason of his non-appearance on the preceding day.  These excuses are of the \"had-to-go-and-see-a-man-about-a-dog\" type,  and rarely meet with that success for which their author hopes. In the  end he discovers that his chest is weak, or his heart is subject to  palpitations, and he forthwith produces a document to this effect,  signed by a doctor. This has the desirable result of muzzling the  tyrannical Game-Captain, whose sole solace is a look of intense and  withering scorn. But this is seldom fatal, and generally, we rejoice  to say, ineffectual.    The next type is the partial slacker. He differs from the absolute  slacker in that at rare intervals he actually turns up, changed withal  into the garb of the game, and thirsting for the fray. At this point  begins the time of trouble for the Game-Captain. To begin with, he is  forced by stress of ignorance to ask the newcomer his name. This is,  of course, an insult of the worst kind. \"A being who does not know my  name,\" argues the partial slacker, \"must be something not far from a  criminal lunatic.\" The name is, however, extracted, and the partial  slacker strides to the arena. Now arises insult No. 2. He is wearing  his cap. A hint as to the advisability of removing this piece de  resistance not being taken, he is ordered to assume a capless state,  and by these means a coolness springs up between him and the G. C. Of  this the Game-Captain is made aware when the game commences. The  partial slacker, scorning to insert his head in the scrum, assumes a  commanding position outside and from this point criticises the  Game-Captain's decisions with severity and pith. The last end of the  partial slacker is generally a sad one. Stung by some pungent  home-thrust, the Game-Captain is fain to try chastisement, and by  these means silences the enemy's battery.    Sometimes the classes overlap. As for instance, a keen and regular  player may, by some more than usually gross bit of bungling on the  part of the G.-C., be moved to a fervour and eloquence worthy of  Juvenal. Or, again, even the absolute slacker may for a time emulate  the keen player, provided an opponent plant a shrewd kick on a tender  spot. But, broadly speaking, there are only three classes.          AN UNFINISHED COLLECTION      A silence had fallen upon the smoking room. The warrior just back from  the front had enquired after George Vanderpoop, and we, who knew that  George's gentle spirit had, to use a metaphor after his own heart,  long since been withdrawn from circulation, were feeling uncomfortable  and wondering how to break the news.    Smithson is our specialist in tact, and we looked to him to be  spokesman.    \"George,\" said Smithson at last, \"the late George Vanderpoop----\"    \"Late!\" exclaimed the warrior; \"is he dead?\"    \"As a doornail,\" replied Smithson sadly. \"Perhaps you would care to  hear the story. It is sad, but interesting. You may recollect that,  when you sailed, he was starting his journalistic career. For a young  writer he had done remarkably well. The _Daily Telephone_ had  printed two of his contributions to their correspondence column, and a  bright pen picture of his, describing how Lee's Lozenges for the Liver  had snatched him from almost certain death, had quite a vogue. Lee, I  believe, actually commissioned him to do a series on the subject.\"    \"Well?\" said the warrior.    \"Well, he was, as I say, prospering very fairly, when in an unlucky  moment he began to make a collection of editorial rejection forms. He  had always been a somewhat easy prey to scourges of that description.  But when he had passed safely through a sharp attack of Philatelism  and a rather nasty bout of Autographomania, everyone hoped and  believed that he had turned the corner. The progress of his last  illness was very rapid. Within a year he wanted but one specimen to  make the complete set. This was the one published from the offices of  the _Scrutinizer_. All the rest he had obtained with the greatest  ease. I remember his telling me that a single short story of his,  called 'The Vengeance of Vera Dalrymple,' had been instrumental in  securing no less than thirty perfect specimens. Poor George! I was  with him when he made his first attempt on the _Scrutinizer_. He  had baited his hook with an essay on Evolution. He read me one or two  passages from it. I stopped him at the third paragraph, and  congratulated him in advance, little thinking that it was sympathy  rather than congratulations that he needed. When I saw him a week  afterwards he was looking haggard. I questioned him, and by slow  degrees drew out the story. The article on Evolution had been printed.    \"'Never say die, George,' I said. 'Send them \"Vera Dalrymple.\" No  paper can take that.'    \"He sent it. The _Scrutinizer_, which had been running for nearly  a century without publishing a line of fiction, took it and asked for  more. It was as if there were an editorial conspiracy against him.\"    \"Well?\" said the man of war.    \"Then,\" said Smithson, \"George pulled himself together. He wrote a  parody of 'The Minstrel Boy.' I have seen a good many parodies, but  never such a parody as that. By return of post came a long envelope  bearing the crest of the _Scrutinizer_. 'At last,' he said, as he  tore it open.    \"'George, old man,' I said, 'your hand.'    \"He looked at me a full minute. Then with a horrible, mirthless laugh  he fell to the ground, and expired almost instantly. You will readily  guess what killed him. The poem had been returned, _but without a  rejection form!_\"          THE NEW ADVERTISING      \"In Denmark,\" said the man of ideas, coming into the smoking room, \"I  see that they have original ideas on the subject of advertising.  According to the usually well-informed Daily Lyre, all 'bombastic'  advertising is punished with a fine. The advertiser is expected to  describe his wares in restrained, modest language. In case this idea  should be introduced into England, I have drawn up a few specimen  advertisements which, in my opinion, combine attractiveness with a  shrinking modesty at which no censor could cavil.\"    And in spite of our protests, he began to read us his first effort,  descriptive of a patent medicine.    \"It runs like this,\" he said:         Timson's Tonic for Distracted Deadbeats       Has been known to cure       We Hate to Seem to Boast,       but       Many Who have Tried It Are Still       Alive           *       *       *       *       *         Take a Dose or Two in Your Spare Time       It's Not Bad Stuff           *       *       *       *       *         Read what an outside stockbroker says:       \"Sir--After three months' steady absorption of your Tonic       I was no worse.\"           *       *       *       *       *         We do not wish to thrust ourselves forward in any way. If       you prefer other medicines, by all means take them. Only we       just thought we'd mention it--casually, as it were--that TIMSON'S       is PRETTY GOOD.    \"How's that?\" inquired the man of ideas. \"Attractive, I fancy, without  being bombastic. Now, one about a new novel. Ready?\"           MR.

Ah Sin was his name;     And I shall not deny,     In regard to the same,     What the name might imply:     But his smile it was pensive and childlike,     As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye.     --Bret Harte.      With over one hundred and fifty illustrations,  by J.H. SMITH.      [Illustration]    [Illustration: Bill Nye]      DIRECTIONS.    This book is not designed specially for any one class of people. It is  for all. It is a universal repository of thought. Some of my best  thoughts are contained in this book. Whenever I would think a thought  that I thought had better remain unthought, I would omit it from this  book. For that reason the book is not so large as I had intended. When  a man coldly and dispassionately goes at it to eradicate from his work  all that may not come up to his standard of merit, he can make a large  volume shrink till it is no thicker than the bank book of an outspoken  clergyman.    This is the fourth book that I have published in response to the  clamorous appeals of the public. Whenever the public got to clamoring  too loudly for a new book from me and it got so noisy that I could not  ignore it any more, I would issue another volume. The first was a red  book, succeeded by a dark blue volume, after which I published a green  book, all of which were kindly received by the American people, and,  under the present yielding system of international copyright, greedily  snapped up by some of the tottering dynasties.    But I had long hoped to publish a larger, better and, if possible, a  redder book than the first; one that would contain my better thoughts,  thoughts that I had thought when I was feeling well; thoughts that I  had emitted while my thinker was rearing up on its hind feet, if I may  be allowed that term; thoughts that sprang forth with a wild whoop and  demanded recognition.    This book is the result of that hope and that wish. It is my greatest  and best book. It is the one that will live for weeks after other books  have passed away. Even to those who cannot read, it will come like a  benison when there is no benison in the house. To the ignorant, the  pictures will be pleasing. The wise will revel in its wisdom, and the  housekeeper will find that with it she may easily emphasize a statement  or kill a cockroach.    The range of subjects treated in this book is wonderful, even to me. It  is a library of universal knowledge, and the facts contained in it are  different from any other facts now in use. I have carefully guarded,  all the way through, against using hackneyed and moth-eaten facts. As a  result, I am able to come before the people with a set of new and  attractive statements, so fresh and so crisp that an unkind word would  wither them in a moment.    I believe there is nothing more to add, except that I most heartily  endorse the book. It has been carefully read over by the proof-reader  and myself, so we do not ask the public to do anything that we were not  willing to do ourselves.    I cannot be responsible for the board of orphans whose parents read this  book and leave their children in destitute circumstances.    Bill Nye        CONTENTS.

Looking over my own school days, there are so many things that I would  rather not tell, that it will take very little time and space for me to  use in telling what I am willing that the carping public should know about  my early history.    I began my educational career in a log school house. Finding that other  great men had done that way, I began early to look around me for a log  school house where I could begin in a small way to soak my system full of  hard words and information.    For a time I learned very rapidly. Learning came to me with very little  effort at first. I would read my lesson over once or twice and then take  my place in the class. It never bothered me to recite my lesson and so I  stood at the head of the class. I could stick my big toe through a  knot-hole in the floor and work out the most difficult problem. This  became at last a habit with me. With my knot-hole I was safe, without it I  would hesitate.    A large red-headed boy, with feet like a summer squash and eyes like those  of a dead codfish, was my rival. He soon discovered that I was very  dependent on that knot-hole, and so one night he stole into the school  house and plugged up the knot-hole, so that I could not work my toe into  it and thus refresh my memory.    Then the large red-headed boy, who had not formed the knot-hole habit went  to the head of the class and remained there.    After I grew larger, my parents sent me to a military school. That is  where I got the fine military learning and stately carriage that I still  wear.    My room was on the second floor, and it was very difficult for me to leave  it at night, because the turnkey locked us up at 9 o'clock every evening.  Still, I used to get out once in a while and wander around in the  starlight. I did not know yet why I did it, but I presume it was a kind of  somnambulism. I would go to bed thinking so intently of my lessons that I  would get up and wander away, sometimes for miles, in the solemn night.    One night I awoke and found myself in a watermelon patch. I was never so  ashamed in my life. It is a very serious thing to be awakened so rudely  out of a sound sleep, by a bull dog, to find yourself in the watermelon  vineyard of a man with whom you are not acquainted. I was not on terms of  social intimacy with this man or his dog. They did not belong to our set.  We had never been thrown together before.    After that I was called the great somnambulist and men who had watermelon  conservatories shunned me. But it cured me of my somnambulism. I have  never tried to somnambule any more since that time.    There are other little incidents of my schooldays that come trooping up in  my memory at this moment, but they were not startling in their nature.  Mine is but the history of one who struggled on year after year, trying to  do better, but most always failing to connect. The boys of Boston would do  well to study carefully my"]]]
