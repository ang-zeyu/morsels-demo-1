This books  claims to be just that and nothing more.    Each of the stories has already won the approval of thousands of  children, and each is fraught with the true Christmas spirit.    It is hoped that the collection will prove equally acceptable to  parents, teachers, and librarians.    Asa Don Dickinson.

Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up!\" cried old  Fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack  Robinson....\"    \"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with  wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room  here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Cheer-up, Ebenezer!\"    Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or  couldn't have cleared away with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done  in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from  public life forevermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were  trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug,  and warm, and dry, and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see on a  winter's night.    In came a fiddler with a music book, and went up to the lofty desk and  made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs.  Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Misses Fezziwig,  beaming and lovable. In came the six followers whose hearts they broke.  In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came  the housemaid with her cousin the baker. In came the cook with her  brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over  the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master,  trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was  proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress; in they all came,  anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands  half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again;  round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping, old top  couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting  off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a  bottom one to help them.    When this result was brought about the fiddler struck up \"Sir Roger de  Coverley.\" Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top  couple, too, with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three  or four and twenty pairs of partners; people who were not to be trifled  with; people who would dance and had no notion of walking.    But if they had been thrice as many--oh, four times as many--old  Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig.  As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term.  If that's not high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it. A positive  light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part  of the dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted at any given time  what would become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig  had gone all through the dance, advance and retire; both hands to your  partner, bow and courtesy, corkscrew, thread the needle, and back again  to your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly that he appeared to wink  with his legs, and came upon his feet again with a stagger.    When the clock struck eleven the domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.  Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and  shaking hands with every person individually, as he or she went out,  wished him or her a Merry Christmas!          II. THE FIR-TREE*    *Reprinted by permission of the Houghton-Mifflin Company.    HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN    Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir-tree. The place he had was a  very good one; the sun shone on him; as to fresh air, there was enough  of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as  firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.    He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care  for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they  were in the woods looking for wild strawberries. The children often came  with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on  a straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, \"Oh, how pretty he  is! what a nice little fir!\" But this was what the Tree could not bear  to hear.    At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year  he was another long bit taller; for with fir-trees one can always tell  by the shoots how many years old they are.    \"Oh, were I but such a high tree as the others are!\" sighed he. \"Then I  should be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into  the wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches; and  when there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the  others!\"    Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds, which morning  and evening sailed above them, gave the little Tree any pleasure.    In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would  often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that  made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the tree  was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. \"To grow and  grow, to get older and be tall,\" thought the Tree--\"that, after all, is  the most delightful thing in the world!\"    In autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest  trees. This happened every year; and the young Fir-tree, that had now  grown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent  great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were  lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be  recognized; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged  them out of the woods.    Where did they go to? What became of them?    In spring, when the Swallows and the Storks came, the Tree asked them,  \"Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them  anywhere?\"    The Swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked  musing, nodded his head, and said: \"Yes, I think I know; I met many  ships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent  masts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.  I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most  majestically!\"    \"Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea  look in reality? What is it like?\"    \"That would take a long time to explain,\" said the Stork, and with these  words off he went.    \"Rejoice in thy growth!\" said the Sunbeams, \"rejoice in thy vigorous  growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!\"    And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the  Fir understood it not.    When Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down; trees which often  were not even as large or of the same age as this Fir-tree, who could  never rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they  were always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid  on carts, and the horses drew them out of the woods.    \"Where are they going to?\" asked the Fir. \"They are not taller than  I; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#1)"],[1,"DAWSON                               AT SINGAPORE                             _by_ R.

The place of ten thousand mysteries.\"    Dave Dawson standing at his elbow chuckled softly and gave a half nod  of his head.    \"Right, my little man,\" he said. \"And the place of ten thousand smells,  too, according to what fellows have told me who've been there.\"    Young Farmer groaned and gave his American pal a scornful look.    \"You would say something like that,\" he grunted. \"Hard hearted to the  core, that's you. No wonder you're the terror of the Nazi pilots.  You've no romance in your soul, Dave. Absolutely none at all. Now,  take Singapore. It's....\"    \"You take it,\" Dawson interrupted. \"Matter of fact, it was your idea in  the first place. There we were, nicely settled in good old England, and  what do you do but up and get itchy wings. And so here we are, three  weeks later, practically over on the other side of the world. You sure  do like to get around, I'll say!\"    The English youth's eyes snapped fire as he faced Dawson straddle  legged and arms akimbo.    \"Well, bless my sainted aunt!\" he exploded. \"Listen to who's talking!  I simply told you there was a rumor going around that Fighter pilots  could put in requests for transfer to other theatres of war, now that  Jerry wasn't sending so many wings over England. It was _you_, my good  man, who went to the Group Commander and checked the rumor. And it was  _you_ who put in a request that we _both_ go to the Far East Fleet Air  Arm. Deny that, Dave Dawson, and over the side you go! And in case you  don't know it, there are a lot of man-eating sharks in these waters!\"    \"Okay, okay!\" Dawson cried and threw up both hands in a token of  surrender. \"But I only did it because I thought you'd enjoy the trip  and the new scenery. Anyway, there's your mysterious Singapore ...  unless the navigation officer aboard this battle wagon has got his  calculations all messed up.\"    \"I accept your humble apology,\" Farmer said and grinned. \"So, we'll say  no more about it. There's one thing, though, Dave. Why did you pick the  Far East for us? There's no action out here, save hunting down a U-boat  and a surface raider now and then.\"    \"No?\" Dawson grunted scornfully and pointed a hand toward the north.  \"Well, a couple of thousand miles up that way there's a group of  islands that are called Japan. It's full of a mess of little brown rats  that even their bucktoothed Emperor Hirohito wouldn't trust any farther  than he could throw an aircraft carrier. And in case you haven't been  reading the newspapers for the last two or three years, Japan is a  member of the Axis. The other two members are Germany and Italy. No  charge for the information, my little man.\"    \"Well, thank goodness you've told me!\" Freddy Farmer snapped. \"It would  be terrible to go on being so ignorant for the rest of my life. All  right, so Japan is up north. What of it? Do you think they'd be mad  enough to attempt to attack the British Naval Base at Singapore? It  would be sheer madness. Suicide for the whole blasted lot of them.\"    \"Sweet tripe!\" Dawson groaned. \"So you've been believing that junk,  too?\"    \"What junk?\" the English youth demanded.    \"The stuff the so called military experts put in the papers, and blat  out over the radio,\" Dawson said. \"Look, as war veterans go, I'm just  as wet behind the ears as the next fellow. But there is one thing that  my war experiences, such as they've been, have taught me.\"    \"Ah, more wisdom!\" Farmer breathed. \"Tell me. I can hardly wait,  Professor!\"    \"Okay, funny boy,\" Dawson said gravely. \"It is simply this, and you  can take it or leave it, for all I care. But ever since Hitler's bums  marched into Poland the thing that everybody believed was impossible  to do was just what the enemy went out _and did_! Well, am I right or  wrong?\"    The English youth didn't reply for a moment or so. He turned forward  and stared at the distant horizon. The Harkness was cutting through  the sun flooded waters of the China Sea at a fast clip, and the  greenish-brown coastline was now well up above the level of the sea.  The peaks of Malay mountains could be seen against the clear blue sky,  and a little to the south was another mark on the horizon that was the  Dutch owned island of Sumatra. The approaches to Singapore! A sight  that one could view a million times and still be eager for another  look. The Far East! Mystery, romance, treachery, and death. It all  depended upon what you wanted ... and upon how you went about finding  it!    Freddy Farmer shook his head as though to break the spell that gripped  his thoughts and his imagination. He turned back to Dawson, and his  face was grave, and his clear eyes serious.    \"Yes, you're quite right, Dave,\" he said quietly. \"The blasted enemy  really has beaten us to it every time, and done the very thing we  didn't even dream he would try. Then you mean...? You look for Japan  to declare war against us here in the Far East, and have a go at  Singapore?\"    \"Hey, hold everything, pal!\" Dawson said with a laugh. \"I'm no crystal  ball gazer, and I haven't got a single secret agent in the Jap  Emperor's palace. I don't know a thing. I've just got a hunch that....\"    \"Good Lord, Dawson, hunches again!\" Farmer groaned. \"I might have known  it would work up to that.\"    \"So it's a hunch!\" Dave growled as his ears got red. \"But my hunches  haven't all been strike-outs in the past, I might remind you. Take that  time in Libya....\"    \"Spare me!\" Farmer cried. \"Didn't I have to live through it with you?  Wasn't that punishment enough for my sin of knowing you? But go on with  what you meant to say.\"    \"Why do I waste breath on dumb bunnies!\" Dawson sighed. \"Well, anyway,  I figure the picture this way. Hitler got England's front door slammed  hard on his fingers when he tried to push it open last year. In Russia  the Jerries are right now receiving the biggest surprise of this war.  They're getting the pants shot off them just when they thought they  were going to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Kremlin, in  Moscow. And in Libya the Wops and the Jerries are setting all kinds  of new Olympic distance records trying to get away from our boys out  there. So, what's left? The Far East. That means Japan. I've a hunch  that the Japs are only waiting for the right moment to jump. Sure, I  may be all wet, and the Japs may stay in their holes. But, I've got the  hunch that they won't. So.... Hey! What am I doing all this talking  for, anyway!\"    \"The old American custom of letting off steam, I fancy,\" Freddy Farmer  said with a chuckle. \"However, I'd not be too surprised if you were  right. The blasted Japs are....\"    The English youth cut himself off short as a young pink cheeked naval  lieutenant came up to them and saluted smartly.    \"Captain Standers' compliments,\" he said. \"He wishes to see you in his  quarters at once.\"    Both Dawson and Farmer nodded, then looked questioningly at each other  as the junior naval rating did a snappy about face and walked away.    \"The Old Man wants us?\" Freddy murmured. \"What for, I wonder?\"    \"Search me,\" Dawson said with a shrug. Then with a quick side glance at  his pal, \"Unless it's for the usual thing.\"    \"Usual thing?\" Freddy Farmer echoed sharply. \"Just what do you mean?\"    Dawson jerked his head at the swiftly approaching shoreline.    \"We're getting close to port, and will be going ashore soon,\" he said.  \"I suppose the Skipper wants to lay down the law to you, as usual. And  get me to promise to keep an eye on you ... as usual. Well, there's one  way to find out. That's to go see him. Come along, my little man.\"    Dawson turned, took one step, tripped over a foot that shot out  suddenly, and went flat on his face.    \"Sorry, old thing,\" Freddy murmured, innocent eyed. \"Was my foot in  your way, by any chance?\"    Dave got slowly to his feet, brushed off his uniform and glanced down  over the side of the cruiser. He sighed and shook his head.    \"What's the sense?\" he growled. \"The sharks would probably throw you  right back aboard!\"          CHAPTER "]]]
