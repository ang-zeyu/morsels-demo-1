The  earliest of them were read to me in London in 1896, when the  writer was seventeen; the later ones were sent to me from India  in 1904, when she was twenty-five; and they belong, I think,  almost wholly to those two periods.  As they seemed to me to have  an individual beauty of their own, I thought they ought to be  published.  The writer hesitated.  \"Your letter made me very  proud and very sad,\" she wrote.  \"Is it possible that I have  written verses that are 'filled with beauty,' and is it possible  that you really think them worthy of being given to the world?  You know how high my ideal of Art is; and to me my poor casual  little poems seem to be less than beautiful--I mean with that  final enduring beauty that I desire.\"  And, in another letter,  she writes: \"I am not a poet really.  I have the vision and the  desire, but not the voice.  If I could write just one poem full  of beauty and the spirit of greatness, I should be exultantly  silent for ever; but I sing just as the birds do, and my songs  are as ephemeral.\"  It is for this bird-like quality of song, it  seems to me, that they are to be valued.  They hint, in a sort of  delicately evasive way, at a rare temperament, the temperament of  a woman of the East, finding expression through a Western  language and under partly Western influences.  They do not  express the whole of that temperament; but they express, I think,  its essence; and there is an Eastern magic in them.    Sarojini Chattopadhyay was born at Hyderabad on February 13,  1879.  Her father, Dr. Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, is descended  from the ancient family of Chattorajes of Bhramangram, who were  noted throughout Eastern Bengal as patrons of Sanskrit learning,  and for their practice of Yoga.  He took his degree of Doctor of  Science at the University of Edinburgh in 1877, and afterwards  studied brilliantly at Bonn.  On his return to India he founded  the Nizam College at Hyderabad, and has since laboured incessantly,  and at great personal sacrifice, in the cause of education.    Sarojini was the eldest of a large family, all of whom were  taught English at an early age.  \"I,\" she writes, \"was stubborn  and refused to speak it.  So one day when I was nine years old my  father punished me--the only time I was ever punished--by  shutting me in a room alone for a whole day.  I came out of it a  full-blown linguist.  I have never spoken any other language to  him, or to my mother, who always speaks to me in Hindustani.  I  don't think I had any special hankering to write poetry as a  little child, though I was of a very fanciful and dreamy nature.  My training under my father's eye was of a sternly scientific  character.  He was determined that I should be a great mathematician  or a scientist, but the poetic instinct, which I inherited from him  and also from my mother (who wrote some lovely Bengali lyrics in her  youth) proved stronger.  One day, when I was eleven, I was sighing  over a sum in algebra: it WOULDN'T come right; but instead a whole  poem came to me suddenly.  I wrote it down.    \"From that day my 'poetic career' began.  At thirteen I wrote a  long poem a la 'Lady of the Lake'--1300 lines in six days.  At  thirteen I wrote a drama of 2000 lines, a full-fledged passionate  thing that I began on the spur of the moment without forethought,  just to spite my doctor who said I was very ill and must not  touch a book.  My health broke down permanently about this time,  and my regular studies being stopped I read voraciously.  I  suppose the greater part of my reading was done between fourteen  and sixteen.  I wrote a novel, I wrote fat volumes of journals; I  took myself very seriously in those days.\"    Before she was fifteen the great struggle of her life began.  Dr.  Govindurajulu Naidu, now her husband, is, though of an old and  honourable family, not a Brahmin.  The difference of caste roused  an equal opposition, not only on the side of her family, but of  his; and in 1895 she was sent to England, against her will, with  a special scholarship from the Nizam.  She remained in England,  with an interval of travel in Italy, till 1898, studying first at  King's College, London, then, till her health again broke down,  at Girton.  She returned to Hyderabad in September 1898, and in  the December of that year, to the scandal of all India, broke  through the bonds of caste, and married Dr. Naidu.  \"Do you know  I have some very beautiful poems floating in the air,\" she wrote  to me in 1904; \"and if the gods are kind I shall cast my soul  like a net and capture them, this year.  If the gods are  kind--and grant me a little measure of health.  It is all I need  to make my life perfect, for the very 'Spirit of Delight' that  Shelley wrote of dwells in my little home; it is full of the  music of birds in the garden and children in the long arched  verandah.\"  There are songs about the children in this book; they  are called the Lord of Battles, the Sun of Victory, the  Lotus-born, and the Jewel of Delight.    \"My ancestors for thousands of years,\" I find written in one of  her letters, \"have been lovers of the forest and mountain caves,  great dreamers, great scholars, great ascetics.  My father is a  dreamer himself, a great dreamer, a great man whose life has been  a magnificent failure.  I suppose in the whole of India there are  few men whose learning is greater than his, and I don't think  there are many men more beloved.  He has a great white beard and  the profile of Homer, and a laugh that brings the roof down.  He  has wasted all his money on two great objects: to help others,  and on alchemy.  He holds huge courts every day in his garden of  all the learned men of all religions--Rajahs and beggars and  saints and downright villains all delightfully mixed up, and all  treated as one.  And then his alchemy!  Oh dear, night and day  the experiments are going on, and every man who brings a new  prescription is welcome as a brother.  But this alchemy is, you  know, only the material counterpart of a poet's craving for  Beauty, the eternal Beauty.  'The makers of gold and the makers  of verse,' they are the twin creators that sway the world's  secret desire for mystery; and what in my father is the genius of  curiosity--the very essence of all scientific genius--in me is  the desire for beauty.  Do you remember Pater's phrase about  Leonardo da Vinci, 'curiosity and the desire of beauty'?\"    It was the desire of beauty that made her a poet; her \"nerves of  delight\" were always quivering at the contact of beauty.  To  those who knew her in England, all the life of the tiny figure  seemed to concentrate itself in the eyes; they turned towards  beauty as the sunflower turns towards the sun, opening wider and  wider until one saw nothing but the eyes.    She was dressed always in clinging dresses of Eastern silk, and  as she was so small, and her long black hair hung straight down  her back, you might have taken her for a child.  She spoke  little, and in a low voice, like gentle music; and she seemed,  wherever she was, to be alone.    Through that soul I seemed to touch and take hold upon the East.  And first there was the wisdom of the East. I have never known  any one who seemed to exist on such \"large draughts of intellectual  day\" as this child of seventeen, to whom one could tell all one's  personal troubles and agitations, as to a wise old woman.  In the  East, maturity comes early; and this child had already lived through  all a woman's life.  But there was something else, something hardly  personal, something which belonged to a consciousness older than the  Christian, which I realised, wondered at, and admired, in her passionate  tranquillity of mind, before which everything mean and trivial and  temporary caught fire and burnt away in smoke.  Her body was never  without suffering, or her heart without conflict; but neither the  body's weakness nor the heart's violence could disturb that fixed  contemplation, as of Buddha on his lotus-throne.    And along with this wisdom, as of age or of the age of a race,  there was what I can hardly call less than an agony of sensation.  Pain or pleasure transported her, and the whole of pain or  pleasure might be held in a flower's cup or the imagined frown of  a friend.  It was never found in those things which to others  seemed things of importance.  At the age of twelve she passed the  Matriculation of the Madras University, and awoke to find herself  famous throughout India.  \"Honestly,\" she said to me, \"I was not  pleased; such things did not appeal to me.\"  But here, in a  letter from Hyderabad, bidding one \"share a March morning\" with  her, there is, at the mere contact of the sun, this outburst:  \"Come and share my exquisite March morning with me: this  sumptuous blaze of gold "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.            ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A HISTORY  BY JOHN G. NICOLAY AND JOHN HAY    VOLUME ONE          TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT TODD LINCOLN      THIS WORK IS DEDICATED      IN TOKEN OF    A LIFE-LONG FRIENDSHIP      AND ESTEEM          AUTHORS' PREFACE      A generation born since Abraham Lincoln died has already reached  manhood and womanhood. Yet there are millions still living who  sympathized with him in his noble aspirations, who labored with him in  his toilsome life, and whose hearts were saddened by his tragic death.  It is the almost unbroken testimony of his contemporaries that by  virtue of certain high traits of character, in certain momentous lines  of purpose and achievement, he was incomparably the greatest man of  his time. The deliberate judgment of those who knew him has hardened  into tradition; for although but twenty-five years have passed since  he fell by the bullet of the assassin, the tradition is already  complete. The voice of hostile faction is silent, or unheeded; even  criticism is gentle and timid. If history had said its last word, if  no more were to be known of him than is already written, his fame,  however lacking in definite outline, however distorted by fable, would  survive undiminished to the latest generations. The blessings of an  enfranchised race would forever hail him as their liberator; the  nation would acknowledge him as the mighty counselor whose patient  courage and wisdom saved the life of the republic in its darkest hour;  and illuminating his proud eminence as orator, statesman, and ruler,  there would forever shine around his memory the halo of that tender  humanity and Christian charity in which he walked among his fellow-  countrymen as their familiar companion and friend.    It is not, therefore, with any thought of adding materially to his  already accomplished renown that we have written the work which we now  offer to our fellow-citizens. But each age owes to its successors the  truth in regard to its own annals. The young men who have been born  since Sumter was fired on have a right to all their elders know of the  important events they came too late to share in. The life and fame of  Lincoln will not have their legitimate effect of instruction and  example unless the circumstances among which he lived and found his  opportunities are placed in their true light before the men who never  saw him.    To write the life of this great American in such a way as to show his  relations to the times in which he moved, the stupendous issues he  controlled, the remarkable men by whom he was surrounded, has been the  purpose which the authors have diligently pursued for many years. We  can say nothing of the result of our labor; only those who have been  similarly employed can appreciate the sense of inadequate performance  with which we regard what we have accomplished. We claim for our work  that we have devoted to it twenty years of almost unremitting  assiduity; that we have neglected no means in our power to ascertain  the truth; that we have rejected no authentic facts essential to a  candid story; that we have had no theory to establish, no personal  grudge to gratify, no unavowed objects to subserve. We have aimed to  write a sufficiently full and absolutely honest history of a great man  and a great time; and although we take it for granted that we have  made mistakes, that we have fallen into such errors and inaccuracies  as are unavoidable in so large a work, we claim there is not a line in  all these volumes dictated by malice or unfairness.    Our desire to have this work placed under the eyes of the greatest  possible number of readers induced us to accept the generous offer of  \"The Century Magazine\" to print it first in that periodical. In this  way it received, as we expected, the intelligent criticism of a very  large number of readers, thoroughly informed in regard to the events  narrated, and we have derived the greatest advantage from the  suggestions and corrections which have been elicited during the serial  publication, which began in November, 1886, and closed early in 1890.  We beg, here, to make our sincere acknowledgments to the hundreds of  friendly critics who have furnished us with valuable information.    As \"The Century\" had already given, during several years, a  considerable portion of its pages to the elucidation and discussion of  the battles and campaigns of the civil war, it was the opinion of its  editor, in which we coincided, that it was not advisable to print in  the magazine the full narrative sketch of the war which we had  prepared. We omitted also a large number of chapters which, although  essential to a history of the time, and directly connected with the  life of Mr. Lincoln, were still episodical in their nature, and were  perhaps not indispensable to a comprehension of the principal events  of his administration. These are all included in the present volumes;  they comprise additional chapters almost equal in extent and fully  equal in interest to those which have already been printed in \"The  Century.\" Interspersed throughout the work in their proper connection  and sequence, and containing some of the most important of Mr.  Lincoln's letters, they lend breadth and unity to the historical  drama.    We trust it will not be regarded as presumptuous if we say a word in  relation to the facilities we have enjoyed and the methods we have  used in the preparation of this work. We knew Mr. Lincoln intimately  before his election to the Presidency. We came from Illinois to  Washington with him, and remained at his side and in his service--  separately or together--until the day of his death. We were the daily  and nightly witnesses of the incidents, the anxieties, the fears, and  the hopes which pervaded the Executive Mansion and the National  Capital. The President's correspondence, both official and private,  passed through our hands; he gave us his full confidence. We had  personal acquaintance and daily official intercourse with Cabinet  Officers, Members of Congress, Governors, and Military and Naval  Officers of all grades, whose affairs brought them to the White House.  It was during these years of the war that we formed the design of  writing this history and began to prepare for it. President Lincoln  gave it his sanction and promised his cordial cooperation. After  several years' residence in Europe, we returned to this country and  began the execution of our long-cherished plan. Mr. Robert T. Lincoln  gave into our keeping all the official and private papers and  manuscripts in his possession, to which we have added all the material  we could acquire by industry or by purchase. It is with the advantage,  therefore, of a wide personal acquaintance with all the leading  participants of the war, and of perfect familiarity with the  manuscript material, and also with the assistance of the vast bulk of  printed records and treatises which have accumulated since 1865, that  we have prosecuted this work to its close.    If we gained nothing else by our long association with Mr. Lincoln we  hope at least that we acquired from him the habit of judging men and  events with candor and impartiality. The material placed in our hands  was unexampled in value and fullness; we have felt the obligation of  using it with perfect fairness. We have striven to be equally just to  friends and to adversaries; where the facts favor our enemies we have  recorded them ungrudgingly; where they bear severely upon statesmen  and generals whom we have loved and honored we have not scrupled to  set them forth, at the risk of being accused of coldness and  ingratitude to those with whom we have lived on terms of intimate  friendship. The recollection of these friendships will always be to us  a source of pride and joy; but in this book we have known no  allegiance but to the truth. We have in no case relied upon our own  memory of the events narrated, though they may have passed under our  own eyes; we have seen too often the danger of such a reliance in the  reminiscences of others. We have trusted only our diaries and  memoranda of the moment; and in the documents and reports we have  cited we have used incessant care to secure authenticity. So far as  possible, every story has been traced to its source, and every  document read in the official record or the original manuscript.    We are aware of the prejudice which exists against a book written by  two persons, but we feel that in our case the disadvantages of  collaboration are reduced to the minimum. Our experiences, our  observations, our material, have been for twenty years not merely  homogeneous--they have been identical. Our plans were made with  thorough concert; our studies of the subject were carried on together;  we were able to work simultaneously without danger of repetition or  conflict. The apportionment of our separate tasks has been dictated  purely by convenience; the division of topics between us has been  sometimes for long periods, sometimes almost for alternate chapters.  Each has written an equal portion of the work; while consultation and  joint revision have been continuous, the text of each remains  substantially unaltered. It is in the fullest sense, and in every  part, a joint work. We each assume responsibility, not only for the  whole, but for all the details, and whatever credit or blame the  public may award our labors is equally due to both.    We commend the result of so many years of research and diligence to  all our countrymen, North and South, in the hope that it may do  something to secure a truthful history of the great struggle which  displayed on both sides the highest qualities of American manhood, and  may contribute in some measure to the growth and maintenance  throughout all our borders of that spirit of freedom and nationality  for which Abraham Lincoln lived and died.
