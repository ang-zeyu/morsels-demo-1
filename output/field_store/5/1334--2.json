MY ROBIN  BY  FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT    ILLUSTRATED  BY  ALFRED BRENNAN              MY ROBIN    There came to me among the letters I received last spring one which  touched me very closely. It was a letter full of delightful things but  the delightful thing which so reached my soul was a question. The writer  had been reading \"The Secret Garden\" and her question was this: \"Did you  own the original of the robin? He could not have been a mere creature of  fantasy. I feel sure you owned him.\" I was thrilled to the centre of my  being. Here was some one who plainly had been intimate with  robins--English robins. I wrote and explained as far as one could in a  letter what I am now going to relate in detail.    I did not own the robin--he owned me--or perhaps we owned each other.  He was an English robin and he was a PERSON--not a mere bird. An English  robin differs greatly from the American one. He is much smaller and  quite differently shaped. His body is daintily round and plump, his legs  are delicately slender. He is a graceful little patrician with an  astonishing allurement of bearing. His eye is large and dark and dewy;  he wears a tight little red satin waistcoat on his full round breast and  every tilt of his head, every flirt of his wing is instinct with  dramatic significance. He is fascinatingly conceited--he burns with  curiosity--he is determined to engage in social relations at almost any  cost and his raging jealousy of attention paid to less worthy objects  than himself drives him at times to efforts to charm and distract which  are irresistible. An intimacy with a robin--an English robin--is a  liberal education.    This particular one I knew in my rose-garden in Kent. I feel sure he was  born there and for a summer at least believed it to be the world. It was  a lovesome, mystic place, shut in partly by old red brick walls against  which fruit trees were trained and partly by a laurel hedge with a wood  behind it. It was my habit to sit and write there under an aged writhen  tree, gray with lichen and festooned with roses. The soft silence of  it--the remote aloofness--were the most perfect ever dreamed of. But let  me not be led astray by the garden. I must be firm and confine myself to  the Robin. The garden shall be another story.  There were so many people  in this garden--people with feathers, or fur--who, because I sat so  quietly, did not mind me in the least, that it was not a surprising  thing when I looked up one summer morning to see a small bird hopping  about the grass a yard or so away from me. The surprise was not that he  was there but that he STAYED there--or rather he continued to hop--with  short reflective-looking hops and that while hopping he looked at me--not  in a furtive flighty way but rather as a person might tentatively  regard a very new acquaintance. The absolute truth of the matter I had  reason to believe later was that he did not know I was a person. I may  have been the first of my species he had seen in this rose-garden world  of his and he thought I was only another kind of robin. I was  too--though that was a secret of mine and nobody but myself knew it.  Because of this fact I had the power of holding myself STILL--quite STILL  and filling myself with softly alluring tenderness of the tenderest when  any little wild thing came near me.  \"What do you do to make him come to  you like that?\" some one asked me a month or so later. \"What do you DO?\"  \"I don't know what I do exactly,\" I said. \"Except that I hold myself very  still and feel like a robin.\"    You can only do that with a tiny wild thing by being so tender of  him--of his little timidities and feelings--so adoringly anxious not to  startle him or suggest by any movement the possibility of your being a  creature who COULD HURT--that your very yearning to understand his tiny  hopes and fears and desires makes you for the time cease to be quite a  mere human thing and gives you another and more exquisite sense which  speaks for you without speech.    As I sat and watched him I held myself softly still and felt just that.  I did not know he was a robin. The truth was that he was too young at  that time to look like one, but I did not know that either. He was  plainly not a thrush, or a linnet or a sparrow or a starling or a  blackbird. He was a little indeterminate-colored bird and he had no red  on his breast. And as I sat and gazed at him he gazed at me as one quite  without prejudice unless it might be with the slightest tinge of  favor--and hopped--and hopped--and hopped.    That was the thrill and wonder of it. No bird, however evident his  acknowledgement of my harmlessness, had ever hopped and REMAINED. Many  had perched for a moment in the grass or on a nearby bough, had trilled  or chirped or secured a scurrying gold and green beetle and flown away.  But none had stayed to inquire--to reflect--even to seem--if one dared  be so bold as to hope such a thing--to make mysterious, almost occult  advances towards intimacy. Also I had never before heard of such a thing  happening to any one howsoever bird loving. Birds are creatures who must  be wooed and it must be delicate and careful wooing which allures them  into friendship.    I held my soft stillness. Would he stay? Could it be that the last hop  was nearer? Yes, it was. The moment was a breathless one. Dare one  believe that the next was nearer still--and the next--and the next--and  that the two yards of distance had become scarcely one--and that within  that radius he was soberly hopping round my very feet with his quite  unafraid eye full upon me. This was what was happening. It may not seem  exciting but it was. That a little wild thing should come to one unasked  was of a thrillingness touched with awe.    Without stirring a muscle I began to make low, soft, little sounds to  him--very low and very caressing indeed--softer than one makes to a  baby. I wanted to weave a spell--to establish mental communication--to  make Magic. And as I uttered the tiny sounds he hopped nearer and  nearer.    \"Oh! to think that you will come as near as that!\" I whispered to him.  \"You KNOW. You know that nothing in the world would make me put out my  hand or startle you in the least tiniest way. You know it because you  are a real person as well as a lovely--lovely little bird thing. You  know it because you are a soul.\"    Because of this first morning I knew--years later--that this was what  Mistress Mary thought when she bent down in the Long Walk and \"tried to  make robin sounds.\"    I said it all in a whisper and I think the words must have sounded like  robin sounds because he listened with interest and at last--miracle of  miracles as it seemed to me--he actually fluttered up on to a small  shrub not two yards away from my knee and sat there as one who was  pleased with the topic of conversation.    I did not move of course, I sat still and waited his pleasure. Not for  mines of rubies would I have lifted a finger.    I think he stayed near me altogether about half an hour. Then he  disappeared. Where or even exactly when I did not know. One moment he  was hopping among some of the rose bushes and then he was gone.    This, in fact, was his little mysterious way from first to last. Through  all the months of our delicious intimacy he never let me know where he  lived. I knew it was in the rose-garden--but that was all. His  extraordinary freedom from timorousness was something to think over.  After reflecting upon him a good deal I thought I had reached an  explanation. He had been born in the rose-garden and being of a  home-loving nature he had declined to follow the rest of his family when  they had made their first flight over the wall into the rose-walk or over  the laurel hedge into the pheasant cover behind. He had stayed in the  rose world and then had felt lonely. Without father or mother or sisters  or brothers desolateness of spirit fell upon him. He saw a creature--I  insist on believing that he thought it another order of robin--and  approached to see what it would say.    Its whole bearing was confidence inspiring. It made softly alluring--if  unexplainable--sounds. He felt its friendliness and affection. It was  curious to look at and far too large for any ordinary nest. It plainly  could not fly. But there was not a shadow of inimical sentiment in it.  Instinct told him that. It admired him, it wanted him to remain near,  there was a certain comfort in its caressing atmosphere. He liked it and  felt less desolate. He would return to it again.    The next day summer rains kept me in the house. The next I went to the  rose-garden in the morning and sat down under my tree to work. I had not  been there half an hour when I felt I must lift my eyes and look. A  little indeterminate-colored bird was hopping quietly about in the  grass--quite aware of me as his dew-bright eye manifested. He had come  again--of intention--because we were mates.    It was the beginning of an intimacy not to be described unless one  filled a small volume. From that moment we never doubted each other for  one second. He knew and I knew. Each morning when I came into the  rose-garden he came to call on me and discover things he wanted to know  concerning robins of my size and unusual physical conformation. He did  not understand but he was attracted by me. Each day I held myself still  and tried to make robin sounds expressive of adoring tenderness and he  came each day a little nearer. At last arrived a day when as I softly  left my seat and moved about the garden he actually quietly hopped after  me.    I wish I could remember exactly what length of time elapsed before I  knew he was really a robin. An ornithologist would doubtless know but I  do not. But one morning I was bending over a bed of Laurette Messimy  roses and I became aware that he had arrived in his usual mysterious way  without warning."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#1)"],[1,"LETTERS OF WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART.

[LETTERS LISTED BY DATE]        PREFACE      A full and authentic edition of Mozart's Letters ought to require no  special apology; for, though their essential substance has already been  made known by quotations from biographies by Nissen, Jahn, and myself,  taken from the originals, still in these three works the letters are  necessarily not only very imperfectly given, but in some parts so  fragmentary, that the peculiar charm of this correspondence--namely, the  familiar and confidential mood in which it was written at the time--is  entirely destroyed. It was only possible to restore, and to enable  others to enjoy this charm--a charm so novel, even to those already  conversant with Mozart's life, that the most familiar incidents acquire  fresh zest from it--by an ungarbled edition of these letters. This is  what I now offer, feeling convinced that it will be welcome not only to  the mass of Mozart's admirers, but also to professional musicians; for  in them alone is strikingly set forth how Mozart lived and labored,  enjoyed and suffered, and this with a degree of vivid and graphic  reality which no biography, however complete, could ever succeed in  giving. Who does not know the varied riches of Mozart's life? All that  agitated the minds of men in that day--nay, all that now moves, and ever  will move, the heart of man--vibrated with fresh pulsation, and under  the most manifold forms, in his sensitive soul, and mirrored itself in  a series of letters, which indeed rather resemble a journal than a  correspondence.    This artist, Nature had gifted in all respects with the most clear and  vigorous intellect that ever man possessed. Even in a language which  he had not so fully mastered as to acquire the facility of giving  expression to his ideas, he contrived to relate to others all that he  saw and heard, and felt and thought, with surprising clearness and the  most charming sprightliness, combined with talent and good feeling.  Above all, in his letters to his father when travelling, we meet with  the most minute delineations of countries and people, of the progress of  the fine arts, especially in the theatres and in music; we also see  the impulses of his own heart and a hundred other things which, in  fascination, and universal as well as artistic interest, have scarcely  a parallel in our literature. The style may fail to a certain degree in  polish, that is, in definite purpose in expressing what he wished to say  in an attractive or congenial form,--an art, however, which Mozart so  thoroughly understood in his music. His mode of writing, especially in  the later letters from Vienna, is often very slovenly, evidencing how  averse the Maestro was to the task. Still these letters are manifestly  the unconstrained, natural, and simple outpourings of his heart,  delightfully recalling to our minds all the sweetness and pathos, the  spirit and grace, which have a thousand times enchanted us in the music  of Mozart. The accounts of his visit to Paris may, indeed, lay claim to  a certain aesthetic value, for they are written throughout with  visible zest in his own descriptions, and also with wit, and charm, and  characteristic energy. As these combined merits can only become apparent  by an ungarbled series of the letters, I have resolved, after many  long years of zealous research in collecting them, to undertake the  work,--that is, to publish the letters entire that have come to my  knowledge.    It now only remains for me to give some words of explanation as to the  method I have pursued in editing them.    In the first place, this edition, (being transcribed closely from the  originals,) if compared with the letters already published, will prove  that the latter are open to many corrections, both in trivial and more  important respects. I have forborne, however, attracting attention to  the deviations from the original text, either in Nissen or Jahn. I have  no wish to be punctilious about trifles, where, as in the case of Jahn,  the principal points are correct. Further, by this faithful production  of the letters, (nothing being omitted but the constant repetition of  forms of greeting and subscription,) we find many an additional feature  in the Maestro's life, and chiefly various facts with regard to the  creation and publication of his works, which may serve to complete  and to amend various statements in Dr. Ludwig Ritter von Kochel's  \"Chronological Thematic Catalogue of the Musical Compositions of W. A.  Mozart,\" (Leipzig, Breitkopf and Hartel). This will be effected not only  by the hitherto unpublished letters, though comparatively few in number,  but also by passages being given in full, which have been hitherto  suppressed as of no consequence. I have referred to Nissen and Jahn only  when, in spite of all my inquiries, I could not discover the proprietor  of the original, or procure a correct copy.    I must also remark that all letters without a special address are  written to his father. I have only adhered to Mozart's defective  orthography in his few letters of early date, and in the rest adopted  the more modern fashion. I did so for this simple reason, that these  defects form a charm in his juvenile letters, from being in accordance  with their boyish contents, while, with regard to the others, they  only tend to distract the attention from the substance of the letters,  instead of imparting additional interest to them. Biographers can,  and ought always to render faithfully the original writing, because  quotations alternate with the text of the biographer; but in a regular  and uninterrupted series of letters this attraction must be very  sparingly used, or it will have a pernicious effect.    The explanatory remarks, and also the supplementary Lexicon, in which  I have availed myself of Jahn's catalogue, will make the letters more  intelligible to the world at large. The Index, too, has been most  carefully prepared to facilitate references.    Lastly, I return my best thanks to the keeper of the Archives of the  Mozarteum in Salzburg, to Herr Jellinck, and to all the librarians and  collectors of autographs who have assisted me in my task, either by  furnishing me with copies of their Mozart letters, or by letting me know  where I could procure them. I would also earnestly request all who may  possess any Mozart letters to send me an exact transcript of them in  the interest of Art; for those here given allude to many still unknown,  which are no doubt scattered about here and there, waiting to be brought  to light.    With respect to myself, the best reward I aspire to in return for the  many sacrifices this collection has cost me, is, that my readers may  do justice to the purpose which chiefly guided me throughout this  publication,--my desire being not merely to benefit science, and to give  a graphic description of the amiability and purity of heart which so  distinguished this attractive man, (for such was my aim in my \"Life of  Mozart,\") but above all to draw attention afresh to the unremitting zeal  with which Mozart did homage to every advance in Art, striving to make  music more and more the interpreter of man's innermost being. I also  wished to show how much his course was impeded by the sluggishness and  stupidity of the multitude, though partly sustained by the sympathy  of kindred souls, till the glorious victory was won over routine and  imbecility. Amidst all the fatiguing process of copying and collating  letters already so familiar to me, these considerations moved me more  vividly than ever; and no work on the Maestro can ever bring them with  such force before the intelligent reader as this connected succession of  letters, containing his own details of his unwearied artistic struggles  and productions. May these letters, then, kindle fresh zeal in  our artists of the present day, both in youthful genius and in  laurel-crowned Maestri!--especially may they have the happiest influence  on those who devote themselves to that phase of Art in which Mozart  attained the highest renown!--may they impart that energetic courage  which is derived from the experience that incessant efforts for  the progress of Art and its appliances enlarge the limits of human  intellect, and can alone insure an immortal crown!    LUDWIG NOHL.    MUNICH, October 1, 1864.          FIRST PART--ITALY, VIENNA, MUNICH.--1770 TO 1776.      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg on the 17th January, 1756.  His father, Leopold Mozart, belonged to a respectable tradesman's family  in the free city of Augsburg. Conscious of being gifted with no small  portion of intellectual endowments, he followed the impulse that led  him to aim at a higher position in life, and went to the then celebrated  University of Salzburg in order to study jurisprudence. As he did not,  however, at once succeed in procuring employment in this profession,  he was forced, from his straitened means, to enter the service of  Canon Count Thun as valet. Subsequently, however, his talents, and that  thorough knowledge of music by which he had already (according to the  custom of many students) gained some part of his livelihood, obtained  for him a better position. In the year 1743 he was received into the  band (Kapelle) of the Salzburg cathedral by Archbishop Sigismund; and  as his capabilities and fame as a violinist increased, the"]]]
