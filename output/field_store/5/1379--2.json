The omission of this sacred duty would indicate,  not only a lack of religious training in the house chief, but a  shameless disregard of all that is reputable in Samoan social life.  No doubt, to many, the evening service is no more than a duty  fulfilled.  The child who says his prayer at his mother's knee can  have no real conception of the meaning of the words he lisps so  readily, yet he goes to his little bed with a sense of heavenly  protection that he would miss were the prayer forgotten.  The  average Samoan is but a larger child in most things, and would lay  an uneasy head on his wooden pillow if he had not joined, even  perfunctorily, in the evening service.  With my husband, prayer,  the direct appeal, was a necessity.  When he was happy he felt  impelled to offer thanks for that undeserved joy; when in sorrow,  or pain, to call for strength to bear what must be borne.    Vailima lay up some three miles of continual rise from Apia, and  more than half that distance from the nearest village.  It was a  long way for a tired man to walk down every evening with the sole  purpose of joining in family worship; and the road through the bush  was dark, and, to the Samoan imagination, beset with supernatural  terrors.  Wherefore, as soon as our household had fallen into a  regular routine, and the bonds of Samoan family life began to draw  us more closely together, Tusitala felt the necessity of including  our retainers in our evening devotions.  I suppose ours was the  only white man's family in all Samoa, except those of the  missionaries, where the day naturally ended with this homely,  patriarchal custom.  Not only were the religious scruples of the  natives satisfied, but, what we did not foresee, our own  respectability - and incidentally that of our retainers - became  assured, and the influence of Tusitala increased tenfold.    After all work and meals were finished, the 'pu,' or war conch, was  sounded from the back veranda and the front, so that it might be  heard by all.  I don't think it ever occurred to us that there was  any incongruity in the use of the war conch for the peaceful  invitation to prayer.  In response to its summons the white members  of the family took their usual places in one end of the large hall,  while the Samoans - men, women, and children - trooped in through  all the open doors, some carrying lanterns if the evening were  dark, all moving quietly and dropping with Samoan decorum in a wide  semicircle on the floor beneath a great lamp that hung from the  ceiling.  The service began by my son reading a chapter from the  Samoan Bible, Tusitala following with a prayer in English,  sometimes impromptu, but more often from the notes in this little  book, interpolating or changing with the circumstance of the day.  Then came the singing of one or more hymns in the native tongue,  and the recitation in concert of the Lord's Prayer, also in Samoan.  Many of these hymns were set to ancient tunes, very wild and  warlike, and strangely at variance with the missionary words.    Sometimes a passing band of hostile warriors, with blackened faces,  would peer in at us through the open windows, and often we were  forced to pause until the strangely savage, monotonous noise of the  native drums had ceased; but no Samoan, nor, I trust, white person,  changed his reverent attitude.  Once, I remember a look of  surprised dismay crossing the countenance of Tusitala when my son,  contrary to his usual custom of reading the next chapter following  that of yesterday, turned back the leaves of his Bible to find a  chapter fiercely denunciatory, and only too applicable to the  foreign dictators of distracted Samoa.  On another occasion the  chief himself brought the service to a sudden check.  He had just  learned of the treacherous conduct of one in whom he had every  reason to trust.  That evening the prayer seemed unusually short  and formal.  As the singing stopped he arose abruptly and left the  room.  I hastened after him, fearing some sudden illness.  'What is  it?' I asked.  'It is this,' was the reply; 'I am not yet fit to  say, \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass  against us.\"'    It is with natural reluctance that I touch upon the last prayer of  my husband's life.  Many have supposed that he showed, in the  wording of this prayer, that he had some premonition of his  approaching death.  I am sure he had no such premonition.  It was I  who told the assembled family that I felt an impending disaster  approaching nearer and nearer.  Any Scot will understand that my  statement was received seriously.  It could not be, we thought,  that danger threatened any one within the house; but Mr. Graham  Balfour, my husband's cousin, very near and dear to us, was away on  a perilous cruise.  Our fears followed the various vessels, more or  less unseaworthy, in which he was making his way from island to  island to the atoll where the exiled king, Mataafa, was at that  time imprisoned.  In my husband's last prayer, the night before his  death, he asked that we should be given strength to bear the loss  of this dear friend, should such a sorrow befall us.        Contents      For Success  For Grace  At Morning  Evening  Another For Evening  In Time of Rain  Another in Time of Rain  Before a Temporary Separation  For Friends  For the Family  Sunday  For Self-Blame  For Self-Forgetfulness  For Renewal of Joy        FOR SUCCESS        LORD, behold our family here assembled.  We thank Thee for this  place in which we dwell; for the love that unites us; for the peace  accorded us this day; for the hope with which we expect the morrow;  for the health, the work, the food, and the bright skies, that make  our lives delightful; for our friends in all parts of the earth,  and our friendly helpers in this foreign isle.  Let peace abound in  our small company.  Purge out of every heart the lurking grudge.  Give us grace and strength to forbear and to persevere.  Offenders,  give us the grace to accept and to forgive offenders.  Forgetful  ourselves, help us to bear cheerfully the forgetfulness of others.  Give us courage and gaiety and the quiet mind.  Spare to us our  friends, soften to us our enemies.  Bless us, if it may be, in all  our innocent endeavours.  If it may not, give us the strength to  encounter that which is to come, that we be brave in peril,  constant in tribulation, temperate in wrath, and in all changes of  fortune, and, down to the gates of death, loyal and loving one to  another.  As the clay to the potter, as the windmill to the wind,  as children of their sire, we beseech of Thee this help and mercy  for Christ's sake.        FOR GRACE        GRANT that we here before Thee may be set free from the fear of  vicissitude and the fear of death, may finish what remains before  us of our course without dishonour to ourselves or hurt to others,  and, when the day comes, may die in peace.  Deliver us from fear  and favour:  from mean hopes and cheap pleasures.  Have mercy on  each in his deficiency; let him be not cast down; support the  stumbling on the way, and give at last rest to the weary.        AT MORNING        THE day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating  concerns and duties.  Help us to play the man, help us to perform  them with laughter and kind faces, let cheerfulness abound with  industry.  Give us to go blithely on our business all this day,  bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonoured,  and grant us in the end the gift of sleep.        EVENING        WE come before Thee, O Lord, in the end of thy day with  thanksgiving.    Our beloved in the far parts of the earth, those who are now  beginning the labours of the day what time we end them, and those  with whom the sun now stands at the point of noon, bless, help,  console, and prosper them.    Our guard is relieved, the service of the day is over, and the hour  come to rest.  We resign into thy hands our sleeping bodies, our  cold hearths, and open doors.  Give us to awake with smiles, give  us to labour smiling.  As the sun returns in the east, so let our  patience be renewed with dawn; as the sun lightens the world, so  let our loving-kindness make bright this house of our habitation.        ANOTHER FOR EVENING        LORD, receive our supplications for this house, family, and  country.  Protect the innocent, restrain the greedy and the  treacherous, lead us out of our tribulation into a quiet land.    Look down upon ourselves and upon our absent dear ones.  Help us  and them; prolong our days in peace and honour.  Give us health,  food, bright weather, and light hearts.  In what we meditate of  evil, frustrate our will; in what of good, further our endeavours.  Cause injuries to be forgot and benefits to be remembered.    Let us lie down without fear and awake and arise with exultation.  For his sake, in whose words we now conclude.        IN TIME OF RAIN        WE thank Thee, Lord, for the glory of the late days and the  excellent face of thy sun.  We thank Thee for good news received.  We thank Thee for the pleasures we have enjoyed and for those we  have been able to confer.  And now, when the clouds gather and the  rain impends over the forest and our house, permit us not to be  cast down; let us not lose the savour of past mercies and past  pleasures; but, like the voice of a bird singing in the rain, let  grateful memory survive in the hour of darkness.  If there be in  front of us any painful duty, strengthen us with the grace of  courage; if any act of mercy, teach us tenderness and patience.        ANOTHER IN TIME OF RAIN        LORD, Thou sendest down rain upon the uncounted millions of the  forest, and givest the trees to drink exceedingly.  We are here  upon this isle a few handfuls of men,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6167"],[0,"Business Hints for Men and Women (#1)"],[1,"Ratliff, Juliet Sutherland, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed  Proofreading Team.

INTRODUCTION        What is a good business man? \"The rich man,\" you may answer. No,  the good business man is the man who knows business.    Are you a good business man?    \"Up to the average,\" you say.    Well, what do you know of business laws and rules, outside your  present circle of routine work?    Now, this handy little volume is a condensation of the rules and  the laws which every man, from the day laborer to the banker,  should be familiar with.    We have not put in everything about business, for that would  require a library, instead of a book that can be read in a short  day, and be consulted for its special information at any time.    It isn't a question of the price of the book to you, or of the  profit to the publisher. Is it good?    Many a man has failed because he did not know the rules and laws  herein given.    Never a man has won honestly who did not carry out these rules and  laws.          CHAPTER I    COMMON SENSE FARMING        The three things essential to all wealth production are land,  labor, and capital.    \"The dry land\" was created before there appeared the man, the  laborer, to work it. With his bare hands the worker could have  done nothing with the land either as a grazer, a farmer or a  miner. From the very first he needed capital, that is, the tools  to work the land.    The first tool may have been a pole, one end hardened in the fire,  or a combined hoe and axe, made by fastening with wythes, a  suitable stone to the end of a stick; but no matter the kind of  tool, or the means of producing it, it represented capital, and  the man who owned this tool was a capitalist as compared with the  man without any such appliance.    From the land, with the aid of labor and capital, comes wealth,  which in a broad way may be defined as something having an  exchangeable value.    Before the appearance of money all wealth changed hands through  barter. The wealth in the world to-day is immeasurably greater  than all the money in it. The business of the world, particularly  between nations, is still carried on through exchange, the  balances being settled by money.    Money is a medium of exchange, and should not be confounded with  wealth or capital; the latter is that form of wealth which is used  with labor in all production.    Broadly speaking, wealth is of two kinds, dormant and active. The  former awaits the development of labor and capital, the latter is  the product of both.    Labor is human effort, in any form, used for the production of  wealth. It is of two kinds--skilled and unskilled. The former may  be wholly mental, the latter may be wholly manual.    The successful farmer must be a skilled laborer, no matter the  amount of his manual work. The unskilled farmer can never succeed  largely, no matter how hard he works.    Trained hands with trained brains are irresistible.    Too many farmers live in the ruts cut by their great-great-  grandfathers. They still balance the corn in the sack with a  stone.    Farming is the world's greatest industry. All the ships might be  docked, all the factory wheels stopped, and all the railroads  turned to streaks of rust, and still the race would survive, but  let the plow lie idle for a year and man would perish as when the  deluge swept the mountain tops.    The next census will show considerably over 6,000,000 farms in the  United States. Farming is the greatest of all industries, as it is  the most essential. Our Government has wisely made the head of the  Department of Agriculture a cabinet officer, and the effect on our  farming interest is shown in improved methods and a larger output  of better quality.    The hap-hazard, unskilled methods of the past are disappearing.  Science is lending her aid to the tiller of the soil, and the wise  ones are reaching out their hands in welcome.    BUSINESS METHODS NEEDED    As farming is our principal business, it follows that those who  conduct this vast and varied enterprise should be business men.    The farmer is a producer of goods, and so might be regarded as a  manufacturer,--the original meaning of the word is one who makes  things by hand. He is also a seller of his own products, and a  purchaser of the products of others, so that, to some extent, he  may also be regarded as a trader or merchant.    Enterprise and business skill are the requisites of the  manufacturer and merchant. Can the farmer succeed without them?    No business can prosper without method, economy, and industry  intelligently applied.    No man works harder the year round than does the American farmer,  yet too many are going back instead of advancing. In such cases it  will be found that there is enough hard work for better results,  and that"]]]
