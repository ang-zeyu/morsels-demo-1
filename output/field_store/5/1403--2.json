WILHELM TELL.          ACT I.    SCENE I.       A high, rocky shore of the lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz.     The lake makes a bend into the land; a hut stands at a short     distance from the shore; the fisher boy is rowing about in his     boat. Beyond the lake are seen the green meadows, the hamlets,     and arms of Schwytz, lying in the clear sunshine. On the left     are observed the peaks of the Hacken, surrounded with clouds; to     the right, and in the remote distance, appear the Glaciers. The     Ranz des Vaches, and the tinkling of cattle-bells, continue for     some time after the rising of the curtain.    FISHER BOY (sings in his boat).  Melody of the Ranz des Vaches.       The clear, smiling lake wooed to bathe in its deep,     A boy on its green shore had laid him to sleep;          Then heard he a melody           Flowing and soft,          And sweet, as when angels           Are singing aloft.     And as thrilling with pleasure he wakes from his rest,     The waters are murmuring over his breast;          And a voice from the deep cries,           \"With me thou must go,          I charm the young shepherd,           I lure him below.\"    HERDSMAN (on the mountains).  Air.--Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.            Farewell, ye green meadows,           Farewell, sunny shore,          The herdsman must leave you,           The summer is o'er.     We go to the hills, but you'll see us again,      When the cuckoo is calling, and wood-notes are gay,     When flowerets are blooming in dingle and plain,      And the brooks sparkle up in the sunshine of May.          Farewell, ye green meadows,           Farewell, sunny shore,          The herdsman must leave you,           The summer is o'er.    CHAMOIS HUNTER (appearing on the top of a cliff).  Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.       On the heights peals the thunder, and trembles the bridge,     The huntsman bounds on by the dizzying ridge,          Undaunted he hies him           O'er ice-covered wild,          Where leaf never budded,           Nor spring ever smiled;     And beneath him an ocean of mist, where his eye     No longer the dwellings of man can espy;          Through the parting clouds only           The earth can be seen,          Far down 'neath the vapor           The meadows of green.       [A change comes over the landscape. A rumbling, cracking     noise is heard among the mountains. Shadows of clouds sweep     across the scene.       [RUODI, the fisherman, comes out of his cottage. WERNI, the     huntsman, descends from the rocks. KUONI, the shepherd, enters,     with a milk pail on his shoulders, followed by SERPI, his assistant.    RUODI.  Bestir thee, Jenni, haul the boat on shore.  The grizzly Vale-king [1] comes, the glaciers moan,  The lofty Mytenstein [2] draws on his hood,  And from the Stormcleft chilly blows the wind;  The storm will burst before we are prepared.    KUONI.  'Twill rain ere long; my sheep browse eagerly,  And Watcher there is scraping up the earth.    WERNI.  The fish are leaping, and the water-hen  Dives up and down. A storm is coming on.    KUONI (to his boy).  Look, Seppi, if the cattle are not straying.    SEPPI. There goes brown Liesel, I can hear her bells.    KUONI.  Then all are safe; she ever ranges farthest.    RUODI.  You've a fine yoke of bells there, master herdsman.    WERNI.  And likely cattle, too. Are they your own?    KUONI.  I'm not so rich. They are the noble lord's  Of Attinghaus, and trusted to my care.    RUODI.  How gracefully yon heifer bears her ribbon!    KUONI.  Ay, well she knows she's leader of the herd,  And, take it from her, she'd refuse to feed.    RUODI.  You're joking now. A beast devoid of reason.    WERNI.  That's easy said. But beasts have reason too--  And that we know, we men that hunt the chamois.  They never turn to feed--sagacious creatures!  Till they have placed a sentinel ahead,  Who pricks his ears whenever we approach,  And gives alarm with clear and piercing pipe.    RUODI (to the shepherd).  Are you for home?    KUONI.            The Alp is grazed quite bare.    WERNI.  A safe return, my friend!    KUONI.                The same to you?  Men come not always back from tracks like yours.    RUODI.  But who comes here, running at topmost speed?    WERNI.  I know the man; 'tis Baumgart of Alzellen.    CONRAD BAUMGARTEN (rushing in breathless).  For God's sake, ferryman, your boat!    RUODI.                     How now?  Why all this haste?    BAUMGARTEN.             Cast off! My life's at stake!  Set me across!    KUONI.          Why, what's the matter, friend?    WERNI.  Who are pursuing you? First tell us that.    BAUMGARTEN (to the fisherman).  Quick, quick, even now they're close upon my heels!  The viceroy's horsemen are in hot pursuit!  I'm a lost man should they lay hands upon me.    RUODI.  Why are the troopers in pursuit of you?    BAUMGARTEN.  First save my life and then I'll tell you all.    WERNI.  There's blood upon your garments--how is this?    BAUMGARTEN.  The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg.    KUONI.  How! What! The Wolfshot? [3] Is it he pursues you?    BAUMGARTEN.  He'll ne'er hunt man again; I've settled him.    ALL (starting back).  Now, God forgive you, what is this you've done!    BAUMGARTEN.  What every free man in my place had done.  I have but used mine own good household right  'Gainst him that would have wronged my wife--my honor.    KUONI.  And has he wronged you in your honor, then?    BAUMGARTEN.  That he did not fulfil his foul desire  Is due to God and to my trusty axe.    WERNI.  You've cleft his skull, then, have you, with your axe?    KUONI.  Oh, tell us all! You've time enough, before  The boat can be unfastened from its moorings.    BAUMGARTEN.  When I was in the forest, felling timber,  My wife came running out in mortal fear:  \"The seneschal,\" she said, \"was in my house,  Had ordered her to get a bath prepared,  And thereupon had taken unseemly freedoms,  From which she rid herself and flew to me.\"  Armed as I was I sought him, and my axe  Has given his bath a bloody benediction.    WERNI.  And you did well; no man can blame the deed.    KUONI.  The tyrant! Now he has his just reward!  We men of Unterwald have owed it long.    BAUMGARTEN.  The deed got wind, and now they're in pursuit.  Heavens! whilst we speak, the time is flying fast.       [It begins to thunder.    KUONI.  Quick, ferrymen, and set the good man over.    RUODI.  Impossible! a storm is close at hand,  Wait till it pass! You must.    BAUMGARTEN.                  Almighty heavens!  I cannot wait; the least delay is death.    KUONI (to the fisherman).  Push out. God with you! We should help our neighbors;  The like misfortune may betide us all.       [Thunder and the roaring of the wind.    RUODI.  The south wind's up! [4] See how the lake is rising!  I cannot steer against both storm and wave.    BAUMGARTEN (clasping him by the knees).  God so help you, as now you pity me!    WERNI.  His life's at stake. Have pity on him, man!    KUONI.  He is a father: has a wife and children.       [Repeated peals of thunder.    RUODI.  What! and have I not, then, a life to lose,  A wife and child at home as well as he?  See, how the breakers foam, and toss, and whirl,  And the lake eddies up from all its depths!  Right gladly would I save the worthy man,  But 'tis impossible, as you must see.    BAUMGARTEN (still kneeling).  Then must I fall into the tyrant's hands,  And with the port of safety close in sight!  Yonder it lies! My eyes can measure it,  My very voice can echo to its shores.  There is the boat to carry me across,  Yet must I lie here helpless and forlorn.    KUONI.  Look! who comes here?    RUODI.              'Tis Tell, brave Tell, of Buerglen. [5]       [Enter TELL, with a crossbow.    TELL.  Who is the man that here implores for aid?    KUONI.  He is from Alzellen, and to guard his honor  From touch of foulest shame, has slain the Wolfshot!  The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg.  The viceroy's troopers are upon his heels;  He begs the boatman here to take him over,  But he, in terror of the storm, refuses.    RUODI.  Well, there is Tell can steer as well as I.  He'll be my judge, if it be possible.       [Violent peals of thunder--the lake becomes more tempestuous.    Am I to plunge into the jaws of hell?  I should be mad to dare the desperate act.    TELL.  The brave man thinks upon himself the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#1)"],[1,"STUART.                    A TRAGEDY.                 By Frederich Schiller        NOTE:  The translation of MARY STUART is that by the late Joseph Mellish,  who appears to have been on terms of intimate friendship with Schiller.  His version was made from the prompter's copy, before the play was  published, and, like Coleridge's Wallenstein, contains many passages not  found in the printed edition. These are distinguished by brackets. On  the other hand, Mr. Mellish omitted many passages which now form part of  the printed drama, all of which are now added. The translation, as a  whole, stands out from similar works of the time (1800) in almost as  marked a degree as Coleridge's Wallenstein, and some passages exhibit  powers of a high order; a few, however, especially in the earlier  scenes, seemed capable of improvement, and these have been revised,  but, in deference to the translator, with a sparing hand.          DRAMATIS PERSONAE.    ELIZABETH, Queen of England.  MARY STUART, Queen of Scots, a Prisoner in England.  ROBERT DUDLEY, Earl of Leicester.  GEORGE TALBOT, Earl of Shrewsbury.  WILLIAM CECIL, Lord Burleigh, Lord High Treasurer.  EARL OF KENT.  SIR WILLIAM DAVISON, Secretary of State.  SIR AMIAS PAULET, Keeper of MARY.  SIR EDWARD MORTIMER, his Nephew.  COUNT L'AUBESPINE, the French Ambassador.  O'KELLY, Mortimer's Friend.  COUNT BELLIEVRE, Envoy Extraordinary from France.  SIR DRUE DRURY, another Keeper of MARY.  SIR ANDREW MELVIL, her House Steward.  BURGOYNE, her Physician.  HANNAH KENNEDY, her Nurse.  MARGARET CURL, her Attendant.  Sheriff of the County.  Officer of the Guard.  French and English Lords.  Soldiers.  Servants of State belonging to ELIZABETH.  Servants and Female Attendants of the Queen of Scots.          ACT I.    SCENE I.       A common apartment in the Castle of Fotheringay.       HANNAH KENNEDY, contending violently with PAULET, who is about     to break open a closet; DRURY with an iron crown.    KENNEDY.  How now, sir? what fresh outrage have we here?  Back from that cabinet!    PAULET.               Whence came the jewel?  I know 'twas from an upper chamber thrown;  And you would bribe the gardener with your trinkets.  A curse on woman's wiles! In spite of all  My strict precaution and my active search,  Still treasures here, still costly gems concealed!  And doubtless there are more where this lay hid.       [Advancing towards the cabinet.    KENNEDY.  Intruder, back! here lie my lady's secrets.    PAULET.  Exactly what I seek.              [Drawing forth papers.    KENNEDY.             Mere trifling papers;  The amusements only of an idle pen,  To cheat the dreary tedium of a dungeon.    PAULET.  In idle hours the evil mind is busy.    KENNEDY.  Those writings are in French.    PAULET.                  So much the worse!  That tongue betokens England's enemy.    KENNEDY.  Sketches of letters to the Queen of England.    PAULET.  I'll be their bearer. Ha! what glitters here?       [He touches a secret spring, and draws out jewels from     a private drawer.    A royal diadem enriched with stones,  And studded with the fleur-de-lis of France.       [He hands it to his assistant.    Here, take it, Drury; lay it with the rest.                     [Exit DRURY.    [And ye have found the means to hide from us  Such costly things, and screen them, until now,  From our inquiring eyes?]    KENNEDY.               Oh, insolent  And tyrant power, to which we must submit.    PAULET.  She can work ill as long as she hath treasures;  For all things turn to weapons in her hands.    KENNEDY (supplicating).  Oh, sir! be merciful; deprive us not  Of the last jewel that adorns our life!  'Tis my poor lady's only joy to view  This symbol of her former majesty;  Your hands long since have robbed us of the rest.    PAULET.  'Tis in safe custody; in proper time  'Twill be restored to you with scrupulous care.    KENNEDY.  Who that beholds these naked walls could say  That majesty dwelt here? Where is the throne?  Where the imperial canopy of state?  Must she not set her tender foot, still used  To softest treading, on the rugged ground?  With common pewter, which the lowliest dame  Would scorn, they furnish forth her homely table.    PAULET.  Thus did she treat her spouse at Stirling once;  And pledged, the while, her paramour in gold.    KENNEDY.  Even the mirror's trifling aid withheld.    PAULET.  The contemplation of her own vain image  Incites to hope, and prompts to daring deeds.    KENNEDY.  Books are denied her to divert her mind.    PAULET.  The Bible still is left to mend her heart.    KENNEDY.  Even of her very lute she is deprived!    PAULET.  Because she tuned it to her wanton airs.    KENNEDY.  Is this a fate for her, the gentle born,  Who in her very cradle was a queen?  Who, reared in Catherine's luxurious court,  Enjoyed the fulness of each earthly pleasure?  Was't not enough to rob her of her power,  Must ye then envy her its paltry tinsel?  A noble heart in time resigns itself  To great calamities with fortitude;  But yet it cuts one to the soul to part  At once with all life's little outward trappings!    PAULET.  These are the things that turn the human heart  To vanity, which should collect itself  In penitence; for a lewd, vicious life,  Want and abasement are the only penance.    KENNEDY.  If youthful blood has led her into error,  With her own heart and God she must account:  There is no judge in England over her.    PAULET.  She shall have judgment where she hath transgressed.    KENNEDY.  Her narrow bonds restrain her from transgression.    PAULET.  And yet she found the means to stretch her arm  Into the world, from out these narrow bonds,  And, with the torch of civil war, inflame  This realm against our queen (whom God preserve).  And arm assassin bands. Did she not rouse  From out these walls the malefactor Parry,  And Babington, to the detested crime  Of regicide? And did this iron grate  Prevent her from decoying to her toils  The virtuous heart of Norfolk? Saw we not  The first, best head in all this island fall  A sacrifice for her upon the block?  [The noble house of Howard fell with him.]  And did this sad example terrify  These mad adventurers, whose rival zeal  Plunges for her into this deep abyss?  The bloody scaffold bends beneath the weight  Of her new daily victims; and we ne'er  Shall see an end till she herself, of all  The guiltiest, be offered up upon it.  Oh! curses on the day when England took  This Helen to its hospitable arms.    KENNEDY.  Did England then receive her hospitably?  Oh, hapless queen! who, since that fatal day  When first she set her foot within this realm,  And, as a suppliant--a fugitive--  Came to implore protection from her sister,  Has been condemned, despite the law of nations,  And royal privilege, to weep away  The fairest years of youth in prison walls.  And now, when she hath suffered everything  Which in imprisonment is hard and bitter,  Is like a felon summoned to the bar,  Foully accused, and though herself a queen,  Constrained to plead for honor and for life.    PAULET.  She came amongst us as a murderess,  Chased by her very subjects from a throne  Which she had oft by vilest deeds disgraced.  Sworn against England's welfare came she hither,  To call the times of bloody Mary back,  Betray our church to Romish tyranny,  And sell our dear-bought liberties to France.  Say, why disdained she to subscribe the treaty  Of Edinborough--to resign her claim  To England's crown--and with one single word,  Traced by her pen, throw wide her prison gates?  No:--she had rather live in vile confinement,  And see herself ill-treated, than renounce  The empty honors of her barren title.  Why acts she thus? Because she trusts to wiles,  And treacherous arts of base conspiracy;  And, hourly plotting schemes of mischief, hopes  To conquer, from her prison, all this isle.    KENNEDY.  You mock us, sir, and edge your cruelty  With words of bitter scorn:--that she should form  Such projects; she, who's here immured alive,  To whom no sound of comfort, not a voice  Of friendship comes from her beloved home;  Who hath so long no human face beheld,  Save her stern gaoler's unrelenting brows;  Till now, of late, in your uncourteous cousin  She sees a second keeper, and beholds  Fresh bolts and bars against her multiplied.    PAULET.  No iron-grate is proof against her wiles.  How do I know these bars are not filed through?  How that this floor, these walls, that seem so strong  Without, may not be hollow from within,  And let in felon treachery when I sleep?  Accursed office, that's intrusted to me,  To guard this cunning mother of all ill!  Fear scares me from my sleep; and in the night  I, like a troubled spirit, roam and try  The strength of every bolt, and put to proof  Each guard's fidelity:--I see, with fear,  The dawning of each morn, which may confirm  My apprehensions:--yet, thank God, there's hope  That all my fears will soon be at an end;  For rather would I at the gates of hell  Stand sentinel, and guard the devilish host  Of damned souls, than this deceitful queen.    KENNEDY.  Here comes the queen.    PAULET.              Christ's image in her hand.  Pride, and all worldly lusts within her heart.        SCENE II.       The same. Enter MARY, veiled, a crucifix in her hand.    KENNEDY (hastening toward her).  O gracious queen! they tread us under foot;  No end of tyranny and base oppression;  Each coming day heaps fresh indignities,  New sufferings on thy royal head.    MARY.                    Be calm--  Say, what has happened?    KENNEDY.               See! thy cabinet  Is forced--thy papers--and thy only treasure,  Which with such pains we had secured, the last  Poor remnant of thy bridal ornaments  From France, is in his hands--naught now remains  Of royal state--thou art indeed bereft!    MARY.  Compose yourself, my Hannah! and believe me,  'Tis not these baubles that can make a queen--  Basely indeed they may behave to"]]]
