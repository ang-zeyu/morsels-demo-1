[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7223"],[0,"The Belgian Cookbook (#1)"],[1,"BELGIAN COOK-BOOK    By Various    Edited By Mrs. Brian Luck      1915        \"Lucullus, whom frugality could charm,    Ate roasted turnips at the Sabine Farm.\"          PREFACE    The recipes in this little book have been sent by Belgian refugees from  all parts of the United Kingdom, and it is through the kindness of these  correspondents that I have been able to compile it. It is thought, also,  that British cooking may benefit by the study of Belgian dishes.    The perfect cook, like Mrs. 'Arris or the fourth dimension, is often  heard of, but never actually found, so this small manual is offered for  the use of the work-a-day and inexperienced mistress and maid. It is not  written in the interests of millionaires. The recipes are simple, and  most inexpensive, rather for persons of moderate means than for those  who can follow the famous directions for a certain savory: \"Take a  leg of mutton,\" etc. A shelf of provisions should be valued, like  love-making, not only for itself but for what it may become.    SAVORIES: If you serve these, let them be, like an ankle, small and neat  and alluring. This dish is not obligatory; recollect that it is but a  culinary work of supererogation.    SOUP: Let your soup be extremely hot; do not let it be like the  Laodiceans. You know what St. John said about them, and you would be  sorry to think of your soup sharing the fate which he describes with  such saintly verve. Be sure that your soup has a good foundation, and  avoid the Italian method of making _consomme_, which is to put a pot of  water on to warm and to drive a cow past the door.    FISH: It is a truism to say that fish should be absolutely fresh, yet  only too many cooks think, during the week-end, that fish is like the  manna of the Hebrews, which was imbued with Sabbatarian principles  that kept it fresh from Saturday to Monday. I implore of you to think  differently about fish. It is a most nourishing and strengthening  food--other qualities it has, too, if one must believe the anecdote of  the Sultan Saladin and the two anchorites.    MEAT: If your meat must be cooked in water, let it not boil but merely  simmer; let the pot just whisper agreeably of a good dish to come.  Do you know what an English tourist said, looking into a Moorish  cooking-pot? \"What have you got there? Mutton and rice?\" \"For the  moment, Sidi, it is mutton and rice,\" said the Moorish cook; \"but in  two hours, inshallah, when the garlic has kissed the pot, it will be the  most delicious comforter from Mecca to Casa Blanca.\" Simmer and season,  then, your meats, and let the onion (if not garlic) just kiss the pot,  even if you allow no further intimacy between them. Use bay-leaves,  spices, herbs of all sorts, vinegar, cloves; and never forget pepper and  salt.    Game is like Love, the best appreciated when it begins to go. Only  experience will teach you, on blowing up the breast feathers of a  pheasant, whether it ought to be cooked to-day or to-morrow. Men, as a  rule, are very particular about the dressing of game, though they may  not all be able to tell, like the Frenchman, upon which of her legs a  partridge was in the habit of sitting. Game should be underdone  rather than well done; it should never be without well-buttered toast  underneath it to collect the gravy, and the knife to carve it with  should be very, very sharp.    VEGETABLES: Nearly all these are at their best (like brunettes) just  before they are fully matured. So says a great authority, and no doubt  he is thinking of young peas and beans, lettuces and asparagus. Try to  dress such things as potatoes, parsnips, cabbages, carrots, in other  ways than simply boiled in water, for the water often removes the flavor  and leaves the fiber. Do not let your vegetable-dishes remind your  guests of Froissart's account of Scotchmen's food, which was \"rubbed in  a little water.\"    SWEETS: It is difficult to give any general directions for sweets. They  should be made to look attractive, and they should be constantly varied.  The same remarks apply to savories, which last ought always to be highly  seasoned, whether hot or cold.    MADE DISHES are a great feature in this little book. I have tried to  help those small households who cook, let us say, a leg of mutton on  Sunday, and then see it meander through the week in various guises till  it ends its days honorable as soup on the following Friday. Endeavor  to hide from your husband that you are making that leg of mutton almost  achieve eternal life. It is noticeable that men are attracted to a house  where there is good cooking, and the most unapproachable beings are  rendered accessible by the pleasantness of a _souffle_, or the aroma of  a roast duck. You must have observed that a certain number of single men  have their hearts very \"wishful\" towards their cook. Not infrequently  they marry that cook; but it is less that she is a good and charming  woman than that she is a good and charming cook. Ponder this, therefore;  for I have known men otherwise happy, who long for a good beef-steak  pudding as vainly as the Golden Ass longed for a meal of roses. Try  these recipes, for really good rissoles and hashes. Twice-cooked meat  can always be alleviated by mushrooms or tomatoes. Remember that the  discovery of a new dish is of more use than the discovery of a new  star,--besides which, you will get much more praise for it. And if on  Wednesday you find that you have to eat the same part of the very same  animal that you had on Monday, do not, pray, become exasperated; treat  it affectionately, as I treat my black hat, which becomes more ravishing  every time that I alter it. Only, do not buy extravagant make-weight for  a scrap of cold meat that would be best used in a mince patty, or you  will be like a man keeping a horse in order to grow mushrooms.    And, lastly, the good cook must learn about food what every sensible  woman learns about love--how best to utilize the cold remains.    M. LUCK.          PART I          CAULIFLOWER SOUP    After you have boiled a cauliflower, it is a great extravagance to throw  away the liquor; it is delicately flavored and forms the basis of a good  soup. Wash well your cauliflower, taking great care to remove all grit  and insects. Place it to simmer with its head downwards, in salted  water; and, when it is tender, remove it. Now for the soup. Let all the  outer leaves and odd bits simmer well, then pass them through a sieve.  Fry some chopped onions, add the liquor of the cauliflower and the  pieces that have been rubbed through the sieve, add a little white  pepper and a slice of brown bread. Let all cook gently for half-an-hour,  then, just before serving it, take out the slice of bread and sprinkle  in two teaspoonfuls of grated Gruyere cheese.          FISH SOUP    When you buy fish and have it filleted, ask for the bones and trimmings  to be sent also. Put a quart of milk to heat and add to it a bunch of  mixed herbs, a few minced shallots, parsley, pepper and salt. Throw in  your fish and cook for an hour. If you have any celery put in a piece,  or two or three white artichokes. Strain the soup, taste it, and add  more salt or more milk as you think necessary. Return to the pan. Take  the yolk of an egg and just before taking the soup from the fire, stir  it quickly in. This soup must never boil. It should be made out of the  very white fish, excluding herring and mackerel.          STARVATION SOUP    If you have a pork-bone from the fresh meat, let it boil in water for  an hour. Put the pan to cool and take off the fat, and remove the bone.  Replace the pan on the fire and throw into it two pounds of Brussels  sprouts. Do not add onions to this soup but leeks, and the hearts of  cabbage. Pepper and spice to taste. Rub it through a sieve and let it be  thick enough to form a thin puree.          IMMEDIATE SOUP, OR TEN MINUTES SOUP    Into a quart of boiling water throw two tablespoonfuls of either  semolina or tapioca: let it boil for eight minutes with a dust of salt  and pepper. Meanwhile, take your tureen, put quickly into it two yolks  of very fresh eggs, add two pats of butter and two small spoonfuls of  water to mix it. Stir quickly with the spoon, and when the soup has done  its eight minutes' boiling, pour it on the egg and butter in the tureen.  This is an extremely good soup. It is rendered still better by a small  quantity of Bovril.          CHERVIL SOUP    Put a bone of veal on to cook in water, with four or five potatoes,  according to the quantity desired. When these are tender, pass them  through the tammy and return them to the soup. Chop up the chervil,  adding to it half a dessert-spoonful of cornflour. Quarter of an hour  before serving, put in the chervil, but take the cover off the pot, so  that it remains a good green color. Pepper and salt to be added also.    [_V. Verachtert, Cafe Appelmans, Anvers._]          A GOOD PEA SOUP    Soak your dried peas over-night. The following day boil some fresh  water, and throw in the peas, adding a few chopped onions and leeks,  with pepper and salt. Let the soup simmer for three hours on the top of  the stove, giving it a stir now and then. If you have a ham-bone, that  is a great improvement, or the water in which some bacon has been boiled  is a good foundation for the soup, instead of the fresh water.    [_Mdlle. M. Schmidt._]          WATERZOEI    This is an essentially Flemish soup. One uses carp, eels, tench, roach,  perches, barbel, for the real waterzoei is always made of different  kinds of fish. Take two pounds of fish, cut off the heads and tails,  which you will fry lightly in butter, adding to make the sauce a mixed  carrot and onion, three cloves, a pinch of white pepper, a sprig of  parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf; pour in two-thirds of water and  one-third of white wine till it more than covers the ingredients and let  it simmer for half-an-hour. Then the pieces of fish must be cut an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#1)"],[1,"and Varieties  Their Origin by Mutation    Lectures delivered at the University of California    By  Hugo DeVries  Professor of Botany in the University of Amsterdam    Edited by  Daniel Trembly MacDougal  Director Department of Botanical Research  Carnegie Institution of Washington    Second Edition  Corrected and Revised      CHICAGO  The Open Court Publishing Company  LONDON  Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co., Ltd.  1906    - - - - -      COPYRIGHT 1904  BY  The Open Court Pub.

DARWIN    The origin of species is an object of experimental investigation.  DeVRIES.    - - - - -    PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR    THE purpose of these lectures is to point out the means and methods by  which the origin of species and varieties may become an object for  experimental inquiry, in the interest of agricultural and horticultural  practice as well as in that of general biologic science. Comparative  studies have contributed all the evidence hitherto adduced for the  support of the Darwinian theory of descent and given us some general  ideas about the main lines of the pedigree of the vegetable kingdom, but  the way in which one species originates from another has not been  adequately explained. The current belief assumes that species are slowly  changed into new types. In contradiction to this conception the theory  of mutation assumes that new species and varieties are produced from  existing forms by sudden leaps. The parent-type itself remains unchanged  throughout this process, and may repeatedly give birth to new forms.  These may arise simultaneously and in groups or separately at more or  less widely distant periods.    The principal features of the theory of mutation have been dealt with at  length in my book \"Die Mutationstheorie\" (Vol. I., 1901, Vol. II., 1903.  Leipsic, Veit & Co.), in which I have endeavored to present as  completely as possible the detailed evidence obtained from trustworthy  historical records, and from my own experimental researches, upon which  the theory is based.    The University of California invited me to deliver a series of lectures  on this subject, at Berkeley, during the [vii] summer of 1904, and these  lectures are offered in this form to a public now thoroughly interested  in the progress of modern ideas on evolution. Some of my experiments and  pedigree-cultures are described here in a manner similar to that used in  the \"Mutationstheorie,\" but partly abridged and partly elaborated, in  order to give a clear conception of their extent and scope. New  experiments and observations have been added, and a wider choice of the  material afforded by the more recent current literature has been made in  the interest of a clear representation of the leading ideas, leaving the  exact and detailed proofs thereof to the students of the larger book.    Scientific demonstration is often long and encumbered with difficult  points of minor importance. In these lectures I have tried to devote  attention to the more important phases of the subject and have avoided  the details of lesser interest to the general reader.    Considerable care has been bestowed upon the indication of the lacunae  in our knowledge of the subject and the methods by which they may be  filled. Many interesting observations bearing upon the little known  parts of the subject may be made with limited facilities, either in the  garden or upon the wild flora. Accuracy and perseverance, and a warm  love for Nature's children are here the chief requirements in such  investigations.    In his admirable treatise on Evolution and Adaptation (New York,  Macmillan & Co., 1903), Thomas Hunt Morgan has dealt in a critical  manner with many of the speculations upon problems subsidiary to the  theory of descent, in so convincing and complete a manner, that I think  myself justified in neglecting these questions here. His book gives an  accurate survey of them all, and is easily understood by the general  reader.    In concluding I have to offer my thanks to Dr. D.T. MacDougal and Miss  A.M. Vail of the New York Botanical Garden for their painstaking work in  the preparation of the manuscript for the press. Dr. MacDougal, by  [viii] his publications, has introduced my results to his American  colleagues, and moreover by his cultures of the mutative species of the  great evening-primrose has contributed additional proof of the validity  of my views, which will go far to obviate the difficulties, which are  still in the way of a more universal acceptation of the theory of  mutation. My work claims to be in full accord with the principles laid  down by Darwin, and to give a thorough and sharp analysis of some of the  ideas of variability, inheritance, selection, and mutation, which were  necessarily vague at his time. It is only just to state, that Darwin  established so broad a basis for scientific research upon these  subjects, that after half a century many problems of major interest  remain to be taken up. The work now demanding our attention is  manifestly that of the experimental observation and control of the  origin of species. The principal object of these lectures is to secure a  more general appreciation of this kind of work.      HUGO DE VRIES.  Amsterdam, October, 1904.    [ix]    PREFACE BY THE EDITOR    PROFESSOR DE VRIES has rendered an additional service to all naturalists  by the preparation of the lectures on mutation published in the present  volume. A perusal of the lectures will show that the subject matter of  \"Die Mutationstheorie\" has been presented in a somewhat condensed form,  and that the time which has elapsed since the original was prepared has  given opportunity for the acquisition of additional facts, and a  re-examination of some of the more important conclusions with the result  that a notable gain has been made in the treatment of some complicated  problems.    It is hoped that the appearance of this English version of the theory of  mutation will do much to stimulate investigation of the various phases  of the subject. This volume, however, is by no means intended to  replace, as a work of reference, the larger book with its detailed  recital of facts and its comprehensive records, but it may prove a  substitute for the use of the general reader.    The revision of the lectures has been a task attended with no little  pleasure, especially since it has given the editor the opportunity for  an advance consideration of some of the more recent results, thus  materially facilitating investigations which have been in progress at  the New York Botanical Garden for some time. So far as the ground has  been covered the researches in question corroborate the conclusions of  de Vries in all important particulars. The preparation of the manuscript  for the printer has consisted chiefly in the adaptation of oral [xii]  discussions and demonstrations to a form suitable for permanent record,  together with certain other alterations which have been duly submitted  to the author. The original phraseology has been preserved as far as  possible. The editor wishes to acknowledge material assistance in this  work from Miss A.M. Vail, Librarian of the New York Botanical Garden.      D.T. MacDougal.  New York Botanical Garden, October, 1904.      PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.    THE constantly increasing interest in all phases of evolution has made  necessary the preparation of a second edition of this book within a few  months after the first appeared. The opportunity has been used to  eliminate typographical errors, and to make alterations in the form of a  few sentences for the sake of clearness and smoothness. The subject  matter remains practically unchanged. An explanatory note has been added  on page 575 in order to avoid confusion as to the identity of some of  the plants which figure prominently in the experimental investigations  in Amsterdam and New York.    The portrait which forms the frontispiece is a reproduction of a  photograph taken by Professor F.E. Lloyd and Dr. W.A. Cannon during the  visit of Professor de Vries at the Desert Botanical Laboratory of the  Carnegie Institution, at Tucson, Arizona, in June, 1904.      D. T. MACDOUGAL.  December 15, 1905.
