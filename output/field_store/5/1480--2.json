In offering this short connected history of my first two explorations  in Africa, I must state that I have been urged to do so by friends  desirous of knowing what led to the discovery of the source of the  Nile. The greater part of it was originally published in 'Blackwood's  Magazine;' but that lacked the connection which I have now given to  the conclusion of my independent journey to and from the Victoria  N'yanza, which is the great source or reservoir of the Nile. The  manner in which I traced the Nile down from the Victoria N'yanza to  Egypt is explained in my 'Journal of the Discovery of the Source of  the Nile.'    J. H.

It was in the year 1849, at the expiration of the Punjaub campaign,  under Lord Gough, where I had been actively engaged as a subaltern  officer in the (so-called) fighting brigade of General Sir Colin  Campbell's division of the army, adding my mite to the four successive  victorious actions--Ramnugger, Sadoolapore, Chillianwallah, and  Guzerat--that I first conceived the idea of exploring Central  Equatorial Africa. My plan was made with a view to strike the Nile at  its head, and then to sail down that river to Egypt. It was conceived,  however, not for geographical interest, so much as for a view I had in  my mind of collecting the fauna of those regions, to complete and  fully develop a museum in my father's house, a nucleus of which I had  already formed from the rich menageries of India, the Himalaya  Mountains, and Tibet. My idea in selecting the new field for my future  researches was, that I should find within it various orders and  species of animals hitherto unknown. Although Major Cornwallis Harris,  Ruppell, and others had by this time well-nigh exhausted, by their  assiduous investigations, all discoveries in animal life, both in the  northern and southern extremities of Africa, in the lowlands of  Kaffraria in the south, and the highlands of Ethiopia in the north, no  one as yet had penetrated to the centre in the low latitudes near the  equator; and by latitudinal differences I thought I should obtain new  descriptions and varieties of animals. Further, I imagined the  Mountains of the Moon were a vast range, stretching across Africa from  east to west, which in all probability would harbour wild goats and  sheep, as the Himalaya range does. There, too, I thought I should find  the Nile rising in snow, as does the Ganges in the Himalayas.    The time I proposed to myself for carrying this scheme into operation  was my furlough--a lease of three years' leave of absence, which I  should become entitled to at the expiration of ten years' service in  India; but I would not leave the reader to infer that I intended  devoting the whole of my furlough to this one pursuit alone. Two of  the three years were to be occupied in collecting animals, and  descending by the valley of the Nile to Egypt and England, whilst the  third year was to be spent in indulgent recreations at home after my  labours should be over.    I had now served five years in the Indian army, and five years were  left to serve ere I should become entitled to take my furlough. During  this time I had to consider two important questions: How I should be  able, out of my very limited pay as a subaltern officer, to meet the  heavy expenditure which such a vast undertaking would necessarily  involve? and how, before leaving India, I might best employ any local  leave I could obtain, in completing my already commenced collections  of the fauna of that country and its adjacent hill-ranges?[1]    Previous experience had taught me that, in the prosecution of my chief  hobby, I would also solve the problem of the most economical mode of  living. In the backwoods and jungles no ceremony or etiquette provokes  unnecessary expenditure; whilst the fewer men and material I took with  me on my sporting excursions the better sport I always got, and the  freer and more independent I was to carry on the chase. I need now  only say I acted on this conviction, and I think, I may add, I managed  it successfully; for there are now but few animals to be found in  either India, Tibet, or the Himalaya Mountains, specimens of which  have not fallen victims to my gun. Of this the paternal hall is an  existing testimony. Every year after the war I obtained leave of  absence, and every year I marched across the Himalayas, and penetrated  into some unknown portions of Tibet, shooting, collecting, and mapping  the country wherever I went. My mess-mates wondered how it was I  succeeded in getting so much leave; but the reason was simply this,  and I tell it that others may profit by it:--The Commander-in-Chief,  Sir William Gomm, observing to what good account I always turned my  leave, instead of idling my time away, or running into debt, took  great pleasure in encouraging my hobby; and his Staff were even heard  to say it would be a pity if I did not get leave, as so much good  resulted from it.    The 3d September 1854 completed my tenth year's servitude in India,  and on the succeeding day, the 4th, I embarked on board one of the P.  and O. Company's steamers at Calcutta, and left the Indian shore for  Aden; but previously to my departure I purchased various cheap  articles of barter, all as tempting and seductive as I could find, for  the simple-minded negroes of Africa.
