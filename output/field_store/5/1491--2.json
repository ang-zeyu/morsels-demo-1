The old book referred to in the Notes I bought from a country  bookseller, who knew neither its author, title, or date, but I have  since been informed the book is Williams' _Observations on the Snowdon  Mountains_, published in 1802, a book well known to students of Celtic  literature.

Once upon a time a lot of fairies lived in Mona.    One day the queen fairy's daughter, who was now fifteen years of age,  told her mother she wished to go out and see the world.    The queen consented, allowing her to go for a day, and to change from a  fairy to a bird, or from a bird to a fairy, as she wished.    When she returned one night she said:    \"I've been to a gentleman's house, and as I stood listening, I heard the  gentleman was witched: he was very ill, and crying out with pain.\"    \"Oh, I must look into that,\" said the queen.    So the next day she went through her process and found that he was  bewitched by an old witch. So the following day she set out with six  other fairies, and when they came to the gentleman's house she found he  was very ill.    Going into the room, bearing a small blue pot they had brought with  them, the queen asked him:    \"Would you like to be cured?\"    \"Oh, bless you; yes, indeed.\"    Whereupon the queen put the little blue pot of perfume on the centre of  the table, and lit it, when the room was instantly filled with the most  delicious odour.    Whilst the perfume was burning, the six fairies formed in line behind  her, and she leading, they walked round the table three times, chanting  in chorus:      \"Round and round three times three,    We have come to cure thee.\"    At the end of the third round she touched the burning perfume with her  wand, and then touched the gentleman on the head, saying:    \"Be thou made whole.\"    No sooner had she said the words than he jumped up hale and hearty, and  said:    \"Oh, dear queen, what shall I do for you? I'll do anything you wish.\"    \"Money I do not wish for,\" said the queen, \"but there's a little plot of  ground on the sea-cliff I want you to lend me, for I wish to make a ring  there, and the grass will die when I make the ring. Then I want you to  build three walls round the ring, but leave the sea-side open, so that  we may be able to come and go easily.\"    \"With the greatest of pleasure,\" said the gentleman; and he built the  three stone walls at once, at the spot indicated.        II.    Near the gentleman lived the old witch, and she had the power of turning  at will into a hare. The gentleman was a great hare hunter, but the  hounds could never catch this hare; it always disappeared in a mill,  running between the wings and jumping in at an open window, though they  stationed two men and a dog at the spot, when it immediately turned into  the old witch. And the old miller never suspected, for the old woman  used to take him a peck of corn to grind a few days before any hunt,  telling him she would call for it on the afternoon of the day of the  hunt. So that when she arrived she was expected.    One day she had been taunting the gentleman as he returned from a hunt,  that he could never catch the hare, and he struck her with his whip,  saying \"Get away, you witchcraft!\"    Whereupon she witched him, and he fell ill, and was cured as we have  seen.    When he got well he watched the old witch, and saw she often visited the  house of an old miser who lived near by with his beautiful niece. Now  all the people in the village touched their hats most respectfully to  this old miser, for they knew he had dealings with the witch, and they  were as much afraid of him as of her; but everyone loved the miser's  kind and beautiful niece.        III.    When the fairies got home the queen told her daughter:    \"I have no power over the old witch for twelve months from to-day, and  then I have no power over her life. She must lose that by the arm of a  man.\"    So the next day the daughter was sent out again to see whether she could  find a person suited to that purpose.    In the village lived a small crofter, who was afraid of nothing; he was  the boldest man thereabouts; and one day he passed the miser without  saluting him. The old fellow went off at once and told the witch.    \"Oh, I'll settle his cows to-night!\" said she, and they were taken sick,  and gave no milk that night.    The fairy's daughter arrived at his croft-yard after the cows were taken  ill, and she heard him say to his son, a bright lad:    \"It must be the old witch!\"    When she heard this, she sent him to the queen.    So next day the fairy queen took six fairies and went to the croft,  taking her blue pot of perfume. When she got there she asked the crofter  if he would like his cows cured?    \"God bless you, yes!\" he said.    The queen made him bring a round table into the yard, whereon she placed  the blue pot of perfume, and having lit it, as before, they formed in  line and walked round thrice, chanting the words:      \"Round and round three times three,    We have come to cure thee.\"    Then she dipped the end of her wand into the perfume, and touched the  cows on the forehead, saying to each one:    \"Be thou whole.\"    Whereupon they jumped up cured.    The little farmer was overjoyed, and cried:    \"Oh, what can I do for you? What can I do for you?\"    \"Money I care not for,\" said the queen, \"all I want is your son to  avenge you and me.\"    The lad jumped up and said:    \"What I can do I'll do it for you, my lady fairy.\"    She told him to be at the walled plot the following day at noon, and  left.        IV.    The next day at noon, the queen and her daughter and three hundred other  fairies came up the cliff to the green grass plot, and they carried a  pole, and a tape, and a mirror. When they reached the plot they planted  the pole in the ground, and hung the mirror on the pole. The queen took  the tape, which measured ten yards and was fastened to the top of the  pole, and walked round in a circle, and wherever she set her feet the  grass withered and died. Then the fairies followed up behind the queen,  and each fairy carried a harebell in her left-hand, and a little blue  cup of burning perfume in her right. When they had formed up the queen  called the lad to her side, and told him to walk by her throughout. They  then started off, all singing in chorus:      \"Round and round three times three,    Tell me what you see.\"    When they finished the first round, the queen and lad stopped before the  mirror, and she asked the lad what he saw?      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    It is the witch that I see,\"    said the lad. So they marched round again, singing the same words as  before, and when they stopped a second time before the mirror the queen  again asked him what he saw?      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    It is a hare that I see,\"    said the lad.    A third time the ceremony and question were repeated.      \"I see, I see, the mirror tells me,    The hares run up the hill to the mill.\"    \"Now,\" said the queen, \"there is to be a hare-hunting this day week; be  at the mill at noon, and I will meet you there.\"    And then the fairies, pole, mirror, and all, vanished and only the empty  ring on the green was left.        V.    Upon the appointed day the lad went to his tryst, and at noon the Fairy  Queen appeared, and gave him a sling, and a smooth pebble from the  beach, saying:    \"I have blessed your arms, and I have blessed the sling and the stone.      \"Now as the clock strikes three,    Go up the hill near the mill,    And in the ring stand still    Till you hear the click of the mill.    Then with thy arm, with power and might,    You shall strike and smite    The devil of a witch called Jezabel light,    And you shall see an awful sight.\"    The lad did as he was bidden, and presently he heard the huntsman's  horn and the hue and cry, and saw the hare running down the opposite  hill-side, where the hounds seemed to gain on her, but as she breasted  the hill on which he stood she gained on them. As she came towards the  mill he threw his stone, and it lodged in her skull, and when he ran  up he found he had killed the old witch. As the huntsmen came up they  crowded round him, and praised him; and then they fastened the witch's  body to a horse by ropes, and dragged her to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team                  THE ABBOT'S GHOST    OR, MAURICE TREHERNE'S TEMPTATION    A Christmas Story      By A.M. Barnard      1867          Chapter I      DRAMATIS PERSONAE    \"How goes it, Frank? Down first, as usual.\"    \"The early bird gets the worm, Major.\"    \"Deuced ungallant speech, considering that the lovely Octavia is the  worm,\" and with a significant laugh the major assumed an Englishman's  favorite attitude before the fire.    His companion shot a quick glance at him, and an expression of anxiety  passed over his face as he replied, with a well-feigned air of  indifference, \"You are altogether too sharp, Major. I must be on my  guard while you are in the house. Any new arrivals? I thought I heard a  carriage drive up not long ago.\"    \"It was General Snowdon and his charming wife. Maurice Treherne came  while we were out, and I've not seen him yet, poor fellow!\"    \"Aye, you may well say that; his is a hard case, if what I heard is  true. I'm not booked up in the matter, and I should be, lest I make some  blunder here, so tell me how things stand, Major. We've a good half hour  before dinner. Sir Jasper is never punctual.\"    \"Yes, you've a right to know, if you are going to try your fortune  with Octavia.\"    The major marched through the three drawing rooms to see that no  inquisitive servant was eavesdropping, and, finding all deserted, he  resumed his place, while young Annon lounged on a couch as he listened  with intense interest to the major's story.    \"You know it was supposed that old Sir Jasper, being a bachelor, would  leave his fortune to his two nephews. But he was an oddity, and as the  title _must_ go to young Jasper by right, the old man said Maurice  should have the money. He was poor, young Jasper rich, and it seemed but  just, though Madame Mere was very angry when she learned how the will  was made.\"    \"But Maurice didn't get the fortune. How was that?\"    \"There was some mystery there which I shall discover in time. All went  smoothly till that unlucky yachting trip, when the cousins were wrecked.  Maurice saved Jasper's life, and almost lost his own in so doing. I  fancy he wishes he had, rather than remain the poor cripple he is.  Exposure, exertion, and neglect afterward brought on paralysis of the  lower limbs, and there he is--a fine, talented, spirited fellow tied to  that cursed chair like a decrepit old man.\"    \"How does he bear it?\" asked Annon, as the major shook his gray head,  with a traitorous huskiness in his last words.    \"Like a philosopher or a hero. He is too proud to show his despair at  such a sudden end to all his hopes, too generous to complain, for Jasper  is desperately cut up about it, and too brave to be daunted by a  misfortune which would drive many a man mad.\"    \"Is it true that Sir Jasper, knowing all this, made a new will and left  every cent to his namesake?\"    \"Yes, and there lies the mystery. Not only did he leave it away from  poor Maurice, but so tied it up that Jasper cannot transfer it, and at  his death it goes to Octavia.\"    \"The old man must have been demented. What in heaven's name did he mean  by leaving Maurice helpless and penniless after all his devotion to  Jasper? Had he done anything to offend the old party?\"    \"No one knows; Maurice hasn't the least idea of the cause of this sudden  whim, and the old man would give no reason for it. He died soon after,  and the instant Jasper came to the title and estate he brought his  cousin home, and treats him like a brother. Jasper is a noble fellow,  with all his faults, and this act of justice increases my respect for  him,\" said the major heartily.    \"What will Maurice do, now that he can't enter the army as he intended?\"  asked Annon, who now sat erect, so full of interest was he.    \"Marry Octavia, and come to his own, I hope.\"    \"An excellent little arrangement, but Miss Treherne may object,\" said  Annon, rising with sudden kindling of the eye.    \"I think not, if no one interferes. Pity, with women, is akin to love,  and she pities her cousin in the tenderest fashion. No sister could be  more devoted, and as Maurice is a handsome, talented fellow, one can  easily foresee the end, if, as I said before, no one interferes to  disappoint the poor lad again.\"    \"You espouse his cause, I see, and tell me this that I may stand aside.  Thanks for the warning, Major; but as Maurice Treherne is a man of  unusual power in many ways, I think we are equally matched, in spite of  his misfortune. Nay, if anything, he has the advantage of me, for Miss  Treherne pities him, and that is a strong ally for my rival. I'll be as  generous as I can, but I'll _not_ stand aside and relinquish the woman I  love without a trial first.\"    With an air of determination Annon faced the major, whose keen eyes had  read the truth which he had but newly confessed to himself. Major  Royston smiled as he listened, and said briefly, as steps approached,  \"Do your best. Maurice will win.\"    \"We shall see,\" returned Annon between his teeth.    Here their host entered, and the subject of course was dropped. But the  major's words rankled in the young man's mind, and would have been  doubly bitter had he known that their confidential conversation had been  overheard. On either side of the great fireplace was a door leading to a  suite of rooms which had been old Sir Jasper's. These apartments had  been given to Maurice Treherne, and he had just returned from London,  whither he had been to consult a certain famous physician. Entering  quietly, he had taken possession of his rooms, and having rested and  dressed for dinner, rolled himself into the library, to which led the  curtained door on the right. Sitting idly in his light, wheeled chair,  ready to enter when his cousin appeared, he had heard the chat of Annon  and the major. As he listened, over his usually impassive face passed  varying expressions of anger, pain, bitterness, and defiance, and when  the young man uttered his almost fierce \"We shall see,\" Treherne smiled  a scornful smile and clenched his pale hand with a gesture which proved  that a year of suffering had not conquered the man's spirit, though it  had crippled his strong body.    A singular face was Maurice Treherne's; well-cut and somewhat haughty  features; a fine brow under the dark locks that carelessly streaked it;  and remarkably piercing eyes. Slight in figure and wasted by pain, he  still retained the grace as native to him as the stern fortitude which  enabled him to hide the deep despair of an ambitious nature from every  eye, and bear his affliction with a cheerful philosophy more pathetic  than the most entire abandonment to grief. Carefully dressed, and with  no hint at invalidism but the chair, he bore himself as easily and  calmly as if the doom of lifelong helplessness did not hang over him. A  single motion of the hand sent him rolling noiselessly to the curtained  door, but as he did so, a voice exclaimed behind him, \"Wait for me,  cousin.\" And as he turned, a young girl approached, smiling a glad  welcome as she took his hand, adding in a tone of soft reproach, \"Home  again, and not let me know it, till I heard the good news by accident.\"    \"Was it good news, Octavia?\" and Maurice looked up at the frank face  with a new expression in those penetrating eyes of his. His cousin's  open glance never changed as she stroked the hair off his forehead with  the caress one often gives a child, and answered eagerly, \"The best to  me; the house is dull when you are away, for Jasper always becomes  absorbed in horses and hounds, and leaves Mamma and me to mope by  ourselves. But tell me, Maurice, what they said to you, since you would  not write.\"    \"A little hope, with time and patience. Help me to wait, dear, help  me to wait.\"    His tone was infinitely sad, and as he spoke, he leaned his cheek  against the kind hand he held, as if to find support and comfort there.  The girl's face brightened beautifully, though her eyes filled, for to  her alone did he betray his pain, and in her alone did he seek  consolation.    \"I will, I will with heart and hand! Thank heaven for the hope, and  trust me it shall be fulfilled. You look very tired, Maurice. Why go in  to dinner with all those people? Let me make you cozy here,\" she added  anxiously.    \"Thanks, I'd rather go in, it does me good; and if I stay away, Jasper  feels that he must stay with me. I dressed in haste, am I right,  little nurse?\"    She gave him a comprehensive glance, daintily settled his cravat,  brushed back a truant lock, and, with a maternal air that was charming,  said, \"My boy is always elegant, and I'm proud of him. Now we'll go in.\"  But with her hand on the curtain she paused, saying quickly, as a voice  reached her, \"Who is that?\"    \"Frank Annon. Didn't you know he was coming?\" Maurice eyed her keenly.    \"No, Jasper never told me. Why did he ask him?\"    \"To please you.\"    \"Me! When he knows I detest the man. No matter, I've got on the color he  hates, so he won't annoy me, and Mrs. Snowdon can amuse herself with  him. The general has come, you know?\"    Treherne smiled, well pleased, for no sign of maiden shame or pleasure  did the girl's face betray, and as he watched her while she peeped, he  thought with satisfaction, Annon is right, _I_ have the advantage,  and I'll keep it at all costs.    \"Here is Mamma. We must go in,\" said Octavia, as a stately old lady made  her appearance in the drawing room.    The cousins entered together and Annon watched them covertly, while  seemingly intent on paying his respects to Madame Mere, as his hostess  was called by her family.    \"Handsomer than ever,\" he muttered, as his eye rested on the blooming  girl, looking more like a rose than ever in the peach-colored silk which  he had once condemned because a rival admired it. She turned to reply to  the major, and Annon glanced at Treherne with an irrepressible frown,  for"]]]
