With  this end in view I have made the selections as full and as varied as  possible and included in the Notes short introductory sketches of the  poets. Since the book is intended for the work of fourth and fifth  semester German in College (or third and fourth year High School),  pedagogic considerations imposed certain limitations not only as to  individual poems but also as to poets. Thus I felt that I must exclude  Novalis, H√∂lderlin, Brentano, Annette von Droste, Nietzsche and Dehmel.  My standard of difficulty--aside from matters purely linguistic--was:  Could a similar poem in English be read and appreciated by the same class  of students? Moreover I tried out in a class of fourth semester German  all poems that seemed to offer special difficulties and have made use of  the experience thus acquired.    Some of my readers will undoubtedly be surprised at finding only two  poems of Schiller included in the collection. May I point to the length  of these two poems, 270 lines? Even to Goethe I have given only 362  lines. Why did I choose these two poems? The lighter lyric verse of  Schiller is not representative of the poet nor would it have enriched the  Anthology with a new note. _Das Lied von der Glocke_ is too long for this  small volume and is readily accessible in three different school  editions. Schiller is at his best in his philosophical lyrics: as Goethe  has said, in this field he is absolutely supreme. Poems like _Das Ideal  und das Leben_ or _Der Spaziergang_ are far too difficult for our younger  students. _Das verschleierte Bild zu Sais_, however, offers a  philosophical problem which the younger mind can grasp without special  training in philosophy. A few introductory remarks, such as I have given  in the notes, will prepare the way. Both poems, furthermore, exemplify  Schiller's ethical idealism. Certainly no other poems available at this  stage could do more.    I have often been asked by teachers: How do you teach lyric poetry? An  answer is found in my Notes to a number of the poems. The chief  prerequisite is a warm love for the poets: nowhere is enthusiasm more  contagious. A few introductory remarks will open the world of the poem to  the student. The teacher must, of course, develop in the students their  latent rhythmical sense both by example and precept. Aside from this  lyric poetry teaches itself.    As to the use of the book I should suggest spending two or three weeks on  one or two poets--I should begin with Goethe--and after that spend one  hour a week for a semester or even a year. Some poems could be assigned  for outside reading and then a group of poems be discussed in class.    On the whole I have limited myself to those poets that to-day stand out  as pre√´minent. A possible exception is the once famous R√ºckert. I could  not resist the temptation of including his _Aus der Jugendzeit_, a poem  of consummate beauty, R√ºckert's one perfect lyric. Time has been  relentless in its winnowing process. But if Geibel, Wilhelm M√ºller and  Bodenstedt have given way to M√∂rike, Keller and Hebbel, we assuredly have  no reason for lament. If this little book help to win in our schools for  these three and for Storm, C. F. Meyer, and Liliencron the recognition  they deserve, I shall feel richly repaid for this labor of love.    _Spring of_ 1921,    Madison, Wisconsin.    FRIEDRICH BRUNS.

WILLKOMMEN UND ABSCHIED    Es schlug mein Herz, geschwind zu Pferde!  Es war getan, fast eh' gedacht;  Der Abend wiegte schon die Erde,  Und an den Bergen hing die Nacht;  Schon stand im Nebelkleid die Eiche,                                5  Ein aufget√ºrmter Riese, da,  Wo Finsternis aus dem Gestr√§uche  Mit hundert schwarzen Augen sah.    Der Mond von einem Wolkenh√ºgel  Sah kl√§glich aus dem Duft hervor;                                  10  Die Winde schwangen leise Fl√ºgel,  Umsausten schauerlich mein Ohr;  Die Nacht schuf tausend Ungeheuer,  Doch frisch und fr√∂hlich war mein Mut:  In meinen Adern, welches Feuer!                                    15  In meinem Herzen, welche Glut!    Dich sah ich, und die milde Freude  Flo√ü von dem s√º√üen Blick auf mich;  Ganz war mein Herz an deiner Seite,  Und jeder Atemzug f√ºr dich.                                        20  Ein rosenfarbnes Fr√ºhlingswetter  Umgab das liebliche Gesicht,  Und Z√§rtlichkeit f√ºr mich--ihr G√∂tter!  Ich hofft' es, ich verdient' es nicht!    Doch ach, schon mit der Morgensonne                                25  Verengt der Abschied mir das Herz:  In deinen K√ºssen, welche Wonne!  In deinem Auge, welcher Schmerz!  Ich ging, du standst und sahst zur Erden,  Und sahst mir nach mit nassem Blick:                               30  Und doch, welch Gl√ºck, geliebt zu werden!  Und lieben, G√∂tter, welch ein Gl√ºck!           *       *       *       *       *    2. MAILIED    Wie herrlich leuchtet  Mir die Natur!  Wie gl√§nzt die Sonne!  Wie lacht die Flur!
