The introduction to the \"History of Woman Suffrage,\" published in 1881-85,  edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn  Gage, contains the following statement: \"It is often asserted that, as  woman has always been man's slave, subject, inferior, dependent, under all  forms of government and religion, slavery must be her normal condition;  but that her condition is abnormal is proved by the marvellous change in  her character, from a toy in the Turkish harem, or a drudge in the German  fields, to a leader of thought in the literary circles of France, England,  and America.\"    I have made this quotation partly on account of its direct application to  the subject to be discussed, and partly to illustrate the contradictions  that seem to inhere in the arguments on which the claim to Woman Suffrage  is founded. If woman has become a leader of thought in the literary  circles of the most cultivated lands, she has not always been man's slave,  subject, inferior, dependent, under all forms of government and religion;  and, furthermore, it is not true that there has been such a marvellous  change in her character as is implied in this statement. Where man is a  bigot and a barbarian, there, alas! woman is still a harem toy; where man  is little more than a human clod, woman is to-day a drudge in the field;  where man has hewn the way to governmental and religious freedom, there  woman has become a leader of thought. The unity of race progress is  strikingly suggested by this fact. The method through which that unity is  maintained should unfold itself as we study the story of the sex  advancement of our time.    Progress is a magic word, and the Suffrage party has been fortunate in its  attempt to invoke the sorcery of the thought that it enfolds, and to blend  it with the claim of woman to share in the public duty of voting.  Possession of the elective franchise is a symbol of power in man's hand;  why should it not bear the same relation to woman's upward impulse and  action? Modern adherents ask, \"Is not the next new force at hand in our  social evolution to come from the entrance of woman upon the political  arena?\" The roots of these questions, and consequently of their answers,  lie as deep as the roots of being, and they cannot be laid bare by  superficial digging. But the laying bare of roots is not the only way, or  even the best way, to judge of the strength and beauty of a growth. We  look at the leaves, the flowers, and the fruit. \"Movement\" and \"Progress\"  are not synonymous terms. In evolution there is degeneration as well as  regeneration. Only the work that has been in accord with the highest  ideals of woman's nature is fitted to the environment of its advance, and  thus to survival and development. In order to learn whether Woman Suffrage  is in the line of advance, we must know whether the movement to obtain it  has thus far blended itself with those that have proved to be for woman's  progress and for the progress of government.    I am sure I need not emphasize the fact that, in studying some of the  principles that underlie the Suffrage movement, I am not impugning the  motives of the leaders. Nor need I dwell upon the fact that it is from the  good comradeship of men and women that has come to prevail under our free  conditions, that some women have hastily espoused a cause with which they  never have affiliated, because they supposed it to be fighting against  odds for the freedom of their sex.    The past fifty years have wrought more change in the conditions of life  than could many a Cathayan cycle. The growth of religious liberty,  enlargement of foreign and home missions, the Temperance movement, the  giant war waged for principle, are among the causes of this change. The  settlement of the great West, the opening of professions and trades to  woman consequent upon the loss of more than a half million of the nation's  most stalwart men, the mechanical inventions that have changed home and  trade conditions, the sudden advance of science, the expansion of mind and  of work that are fostered by the play of a free government,--all these  have tended to place man and woman, but especially woman, where something  like a new heaven and a new earth are in the distant vision.    To this change the Suffragists call attention, and say, \"This is, in great  part, our work.\" In this little book I shall recount a few of the facts  that, in my opinion, go to prove that the Suffrage movement has had but  little part or lot in this matter. And because of these facts I believe  the principles on which the claim to suffrage is founded are those that  turn individuals and nations backward and not forward.    The first proof I shall mention is the latest one in time--it is the fact  of an Anti-Suffrage movement. In the political field alone are we being  formed into separate camps whose watchwords become more unlike as they  become more clearly understood. The fact that for the first time in our  history representatives of two great organizations of women are appealing  to courts and legislatures, each begging them to refuse the prayer of the  other, shows, as conclusively as a long argument could do, that this  matter of suffrage is something essentially distinct from the great series  of movements in which women thus far have advanced side by side. It is an  instinctive announcement of a belief that the demand for suffrage is not  progress; that it does array sex against sex; that woman, like man, can  advance only as the race advances; and that here lies the dividing line.    How absolute is that dividing line between woman's progress and woman  suffrage, we may realize when we consider what the result would be if we  could know to-morrow, beyond a peradventure, that woman never would vote  in the United States. Not one of her charities, great or small, would be  crippled. Not a woman's college would close its doors. Not a profession  would withhold its diploma from her; not a trade its recompense. Not a  single just law would be repealed, or a bad one framed, as a consequence.  Not a good book would be forfeited. Not a family would be less secure of  domestic happiness. Not a single hope would die which points to a time  when our cities will all be like those of the prophet's vision, \"first  pure and then peaceable.\"    Among the forces that are universally considered progressive are: the  democratic idea in government, extinction of slavery, increase of  educational and industrial opportunities for woman, improvement in the  statute laws, and spread of religious freedom. The Woman-Suffrage movement  professed to champion these causes. That movement is now nearly fifty  years old, and has made a record by which its relation to them can be  judged. What is the verdict?          CHAPTER II.      IS WOMAN SUFFRAGE DEMOCRATIC?      As the claim of woman to share the voting power is related to the  fundamental principles of government, the progress of government must be  studied in relation to that claim in order to learn its bearing upon them.  It is possible to suggest in one brief chapter only the barest outline of  such a far-reaching scrutiny, and wiser heads than mine must search to  conclusion; but some beginnings looking toward an answer to the inquiry I  have raised have occurred to me as not having entered into the newly-  opened controversy on woman suffrage.    I say, the newly-opened controversy, for, through these fifty years, the  Suffragists have done nearly all the talking. So persistently have they  laid claim to being in the line of progress for woman, that many of their  newly aroused opponents fancied that the anti-suffrage view might be the  ultra conservative one, and that democratic principles, strictly and  broadly applied, might at last lead to woman suffrage, though premature if  pushed to a conclusion now.    The first step in finding out how far that position is true is, to  ascertain what the Suffragists say about this noblest of democracies, our  own Government. In referring to the \"The History of Woman Suffrage\" for  the opinions of the leaders, I am not only using a book that on its  publication was considered a strong and full presentment of their  arguments, but one which they are today advertising and selling as \"a  perfect arsenal of the work done by and for women during the last half  century.\" In it the editors say: \"Woman's political equality with man is  the legitimate outgrowth of the fundamental principles of our government.\"  Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, writing in the New York Sun in April, 1894, says:  \"Never, until the establishment of universal [male] suffrage, did it  happen that all the women in a community, no matter how well born, how  intelligent, how well educated, how virtuous, how wealthy, were counted  the political inferiors of all the men, no matter how base born, how  stupid, how ignorant, how brutal, how poverty-stricken. This anomaly is  the real innovation. Men have personally ruled the women of their  families; the law has annihilated the separate existence of women; but  women have never been subjected to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],[0,"Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team.

BEING THE CONTINUATION OF    \"JACK HARKAWAY AND HIS    SON'S ADVENTURES IN GREECE.\"      BY    BRACEBRIDGE HEMYNG        [Illustration: Bother the beggars\"--said Mr Mole\"--Adv in Greece, Vol  II--_Frontispiece_]          CHAPTER I.    THE CONTESSA'S LETTER TO MR. MOLE--ON PLEASURE BENT--THE  MENDICANT FRIAR--MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS--HOUSE BREAKING.      When Mrs. Harkaway's maid returned to the villa, she got scolded for  being so long upon an errand of some importance with which she had been  entrusted.    Thereupon, she was prepared with twenty excuses, all of which were any  thing but the truth.    The words of warning which the brigand had called after her had not  been without their due effect.    \"She had been detained,\" she said, \"by the Contessa Maraviglia for the  letter which she brought back to Mr. Mole.\"    The letter was an invitation to a grand ball which was to be given by  the contessa at the Palazzo Maraviglia, and to which the Harkaways were  going.    Dick Harvey had been at work in this business, and had made the  contessa believe indirectly that Mr. Mole was a most graceful dancer,  and that it would be an eternal shame for a _bal masque_ to take  place in the neighbourhood without being graced by his--Mole's--presence.    The result was that during lunch Mr. Mole received from the maid the  following singular effusion.    \"Al Illustrissimo Signor Mole,\" which, being translated, means, \"To the  illustrious Mr. Mole.\"    \"Hullo!\" said the tutor, looking around him and dropping his eye on  Dick, \"who is this from?\"    \"From the Contessa Maraviglia,\" replied the girl.    Mr. Mole gave her a piercing glance.    The contessa's letter was a sort of puzzle to poor old Mole.    \"The Contessa Maraviglia begs the honour of the Signor Mole's company  on the 16th instant. She can accept no refusal, as the _fete_ is  especially organised in honour of Signor Mole, whose rare excellence in  the poetry of motion has elevated dancing into an art.\"    Isaac Mole read and re-read this singular letter, until he grew more  and more fogged.    He thought that the contessa had failed to express herself clearly in  English on account of her imperfect knowledge of our language; but he  was soon corrected in this impression.    The lady in question, it transpired, was English.    So poor Mole did what he thought best under the circumstances, and that  was to consult with Dick Harvey.    \"Dear me!\" echoed Dick, innocently; \"why, you have made an impression  here, Mr. Mole.\"    \"Do you think so?\" said Mole, doubtfully.    \"Beyond question. This contessa is smitten, sir, with your attractions;  but I can assist you here.\"    \"You can?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"Thank you, my dear Harvey, thank you,\" replied Mr. Mole eagerly.    \"Yes; I can let the contessa know that there is no hope for her.\"    Isaac Mole's vanity was tickled at this.    \"Don't you think it would be cruel to undeceive her?\"    \"Cruel, sir!\" said Dick, with severe air, \"no, sir; I don't. It is my  duty to tell her all.\"    Mr. Mole looked alarmed.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"That you are a married man.\"    \"I say, I say--\"    \"Yes, sir, very much married,\" pursued Dick, relentlessly; \"that you  have had three wives, and were nearly taking a fourth.\"    \"Don't, Dick.\"    \"All more or less black.\"    \"Dick, Dick!\"    \"However, there is no help for it; you will have to go to this ball.\"    \"Never.\"    \"You will, though. The contessa has heard of your fame in the ball  room--\"    \"What!\"    \"In bygone years, no doubt--and she does not know of the little matters  which have happened since to spoil your activity, if not your grace.\"    As he alluded to the \"little matters,\" he glanced at Mr. Mole's wooden  legs.    Mr. Mole thought it over, and then he read through the letter again.    \"You are right, Harvey,\" he said with an air of determination; \"and my  mind's made up.\"    \"Is it?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"So much the better, for your absence would be sadly missed at the  ball.\"    \"You misunderstand me, Harvey; I shall not go.\"    Dick looked frightened.    \"Don't say that, Mr. Mole, I beg, don't; it would be dangerous.\"    \"What on earth do you mean?\"    \"I mean that this lady is English by birth, but she has lived in the  land of the Borgias, where they yet know how to use poison.\"    \"Harvey!\"    \"And if her love were slighted, she might recollect it.\"    Mr. Mole looked precious uncomfortable.    \"It is really very embarrassing, Harvey,\" said he; \"my personal  attractions are likely to get me into trouble.\"    And yet, in spite of his embarrassment, Mr. Mole was not altogether  displeased at the fancy.    He strutted up and down, showing the fall in his back to the best  advantage, and was very evidently conscious that he was rather a fine  man.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Harvey, with great gravity; \"your fatal beauty is  likely to lead you into a mess.\"    At the words \"fatal beauty,\" Mr. Mole made a grimace.    It was rather a strong dose for even him to swallow.    \"Draw it mild, Harvey,\" said he, \"pray draw it mild.\"    Dick shook his head with great seriousness.    \"Don't you be deceived, Mr. Mole,\" said he; \"use the greatest care, for  this poor countess is to be pitied. Her love is likely to turn to  violent hate if she finds herself slighted--the poignard or the  poisoned chalice may yet be called to play a part in your career.\"    Mr. Mole turned pale.    Yet he tried to laugh.    A hollow ghastly laugh it was too, that told how he felt more plainly  than words could have done.    \"Don't, Harvey; don't, I beg!\" he said in faltering tones; \"it sounds  like some dreadful thing one sees upon the stage.\"    \"In all these southern countries you know, Mr. Mole, a man's life is  not worth much.\"    \"Harvey!\"    \"A hired assassin or bravo will cut a throat or stab a man in the back  for a few francs.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"I should advise you not to keep out after dark--and avoid dark  corners. These people can poison you, too, with a bouquet or a jewel.  Accept a flower or a nosegay, but don't smell it.\"    \"Harvey.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Is it your wish to make me uncomfortable?\"    \"How can you think it?\"    \"Do you wish me to dream all night, and disturb Mrs. Mole, and not to  get a wink of sleep?\"    \"Certainly not; that's why I am giving you advice; but pray understand  the contessa thinks you are a single man.\"    \"Good gracious me; it is very unpleasant to have a contessa in love  with one.\"    \"I don't know that; most men wouldn't say so. There are, I'll be bound,  forty men within a mile of this house who would give their ears to have  received such a letter.\"    Mr. Mole smiled--a self-satisfied, complacent smile,    \"Do you think so?\"    \"I know it.\"    Mole lifted his collar and shot his cuffs over his hands, as he stomped  across the room, and looked into a glass.    \"Well, well, Harvey, I suppose I must go to the ball; but you will bear  me witness that I only go for reasons of prudence, and that I am not  going to be led away by any little silly reasons of vanity?\"    \"Of course,\" returned Dick, gravely.    \"Besides, I go disguised.\"    \"Certainly\"    \"And what disguise would you recommend?\"    \"Why that is a matter for reflection,\" said Dick. \"I should think that  you ought almost to keep up the character.\"    \"The character!\" said Mole. \"What character?\"    \"A Terpsichorean personage,\" replied Dick, with the air of one  discussing a grave problem. \"Say, for instance, a ballet girl.\"    Mr. Mole gasped.    \"No, no; not a ballet girl.\"    \"A fairy queen, then.\"    \"Don't, Dick; don't, I beg.\"    \"Or, if you object to the costume of the gentler sex, what do you say  to the spangles and wand of a harlequin?\"    \"Do you really think that such a costume would become me?\"    \"Do I think?\" iterated Dick. \"Do I _know!_ Of course it would  become you. You will look the part to the life: it wants a figure to  show off such a dress and to be shown off by it.\"    \"But what about my--my wooden legs, Dick?\"    \"Oh, I'll provide you with cork ones, and here they are,\" said Harvey,  producing a pair.    And so it was settled.    Mr. Mole was to go to the ball, and his disguise was to be well-known  spangles and colours of a harlequin.    Harvey himself chose a clown's costume and carried over his shoulder  Mole's wooden legs, in case any thing happened to the cork ones he was  walking on for the first time.    Harkaway was to go as a knight of old.    Magog Brand selected the character of Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre  Dame.    Jefferson selected the character of Julius Caesar, a costume which his  fine, stalwart form set off to considerable advantage.    Mrs. Harkaway was to go as Diana, the huntress, and Mrs. Harvey made  Marie Stuart her choice.    Little Emily and Paquita went in dresses of the Charles the Second  period.    These young ladies were escorted by young Jack and Harry Girdwood, who  were richly habited as young Venetian nobles of the sixteenth century.    As they passed through the garden door a man stood in their path.    He wore a long serge gown, with a cowl, like a mendicant monk, and as  they approached he put out his open hand for alms.    \"Bother the beggars!\" said Mr. Mole, tartly.    The monk shrank back into his cowl, and stood aside while the party  went by.    The garden door was held by the maid servant while they passed on, and  when they were out of hearing, she dropped a small silver coin into the  mendicant friar's hand.    \"There,\" she said, \"I can spare you something, father, although those  rich English cannot or will not, the heretics and pagans!\"    The friar, who was seemingly an aged man, muttered his thanks, and the  girl retired and closed the door, locking it behind her.    No sooner was the door closed than the mendicant monk whistled a low  but very distinct note, and lo! two"]]]
