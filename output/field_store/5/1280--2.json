Truly enough they are not popular, like the last new novel  which, for one reason or another, has taken the town by storm, and it  would not pay to reprint a single one of them, even the best or most  important that has ever held the frequenters of auction-rooms  spell-bound.    Sometimes a 'parcel' will be sold for what it will fetch, and on  investigation may prove to contain a few simple-minded pamphlets on  subjects of no importance, 'and others,' the latter consisting of  book-catalogues of the last or the earlier portion of the present  century. This happens sufficiently often to make it possible for a  bookish enthusiast of an antiquarian turn of mind to lose himself with  marvellous rapidity in a maze of old-time dispersions.  But the  enthusiast, unless very determined indeed, knows better than to choke  his library with such material.  He is aware that an exhaustive index is  indispensable to the proper appreciation of such literature, and to make  that would occupy his nights indefinitely.    And so it comes to pass that old sale-catalogues of books are consigned  for the most part to the rubbish-heap, or perhaps sent to the mills, to  reappear later on in another guise.  They may be scarce in the sense  that, if you wanted a particular one, it could only be got with great  difficulty, and at considerable expense (here the art of selling to  advantage comes in), or perhaps not at all.  This, however, makes no  matter, for the fact remains that such things are not inquired for as a  general rule, and that an occasional demand is insufficient to give them  any kind of a status in the world of letters.    Some five or six years ago a member of the Johnson Club, a literary  society which meets at intervals in various parts of London, but more  particularly in Fleet Street, discovered a catalogue of the sale of the  old Doctor's library, neatly marked with the prices each book had  brought. Whether this was a sale _post mortem_ or a casual interlocutory  dispersal at the instance of some soulless creditor, I do not know.  In  any case the relic was a find--a fact which the bookseller who bought it  was not slow to appreciate, for he at once assessed its value, to the  society man, at something like forty shillings.  This was paid without  demur, because at the time all the other Johnson catalogues were in  mufti, and it had struck no one to exhibit them, and also because it  was, under the circumstances of the case, a very desirable memorial to  present to the society which flourishes on the fame of the great  lexicographer.  Here, at any rate, is one exceptional instance of an old  catalogue possessing a distinct pecuniary value up to L2, and though the  noise this discovery made in certain circles led to a general search and  the rescue of other copies, the circumstances are not in the least  affected on that account.    From a literary or even a sentimental standpoint, a long story, full of  speculation and romance, might be written on Dr. Johnson's  long-forgotten catalogue.  We might, for instance, trace, by the aid of  Boswell, many of the books mentioned in it to the very hand of the  master himself.  We might conjecture the use he made of this volume or  that in his 'Lives of the Poets,' 'The Vanity of Human Wishes,' or in  the ponderous Dictionary that cemented his fame, and by way of interlude  beguile an hour occasionally by contrasting the character of the books  he affected with the quality of those on the shelves of some modern  Johnson, assuming, of course, that his counterpart is to be found.  Then  we might look at the prices realized, and compare them with those ruling  at the present day.  Some books then in fashion are, we may be sure, now  despised and rejected, others have not been appreciably affected by the  course of time, while others, again, are now sought after throughout the  world, and are hardly to be met with at all.  There is no old catalogue  whatever which is not capable of affording considerable instruction if  we only read between the lines.    Then, again, there is one speculation that no true book-lover can  stifle; it haunts him as he passes the barrows with their loads of  sermons and scholastic primers, and it is this: 'Time works wonders.'  Some day may not this heterogeneous mass of rubbish produce as fine a  pearl as ever a diseased oyster was robbed of?  May not fashion go off  at a tangent, and dote on lexicons or what not?  There have been  men--Rossi, for example, who was so saturated with the suspicion that  fashion might change any moment that the stalls by which he passed were  'like towns through which Attila or the Tartars had swept, with ruin in  their train'--who would buy any book whatever, whether they wanted it or  not, on the bare chance of someone else wanting it, either at the time  or in the days to come.    Such may be the outcome of a too eager perusal of catalogues, focussed  till it produces an absorbing passion, which only departs with life  itself.  After a time discrimination, naturally enough, becomes  impossible, and whole masses of books are bought up for what they may  become, not for what they are. This may appear to be an ignoble sort of  pastime, but in reality it is far otherwise, since wholesale purchasers  of this stamp are invariably well read, and know more about their author  than his mere name.  I personally was acquainted with a bookworm who  absorbed whole collections at a time. His house was full of books; they  were under the beds, in cupboards, piled up along the walls, under the  tables and chairs, and even on the rafters under the roof.  If you  walked without due care, you would, more likely than not, tumble over a  folio in the dark, or bring down a wall of literature, good, bad, or  indifferent, on your head. This library was chaotic to the general,  though the worm himself knew very well where to burrow for anything he  required, and, what is more to the point, would feed for hours on  volumes that few people had ever so much as heard of. The monetary value  of his treasures did not trouble him, though one of his favourite  anecdotes related to the hunting down of a fourth folio Shakespeare,  which, after much haggling, he purchased for a song from a poor woman  who lived in an almshouse.  When the delight of the chase was over, he  recompensed her to the full market value, thereby proving that, in his  case at least, a greed for books does not necessarily carry with it a  stifled conscience.  Sad to relate, this bibliophile died like other  men, and the collection of a lifetime came to the inevitable hammer.  Most of his books then proved to be portions of sets. If a work were  complete in, say, ten volumes, he would perhaps possess no more than  five or six of the full number in various bindings and editions, while  others, though complete, were imperfect, and many were in rags.  Yet  among the whole there were some pearls of great price.  Even in his day  the fashion had changed in his favour.    Now, this changing of fashion which is always going on cannot be  prophesied at haphazard, or perhaps even at all; but if there is a way  of forestalling it, it is by the careful comparison of prices realized  for books of a certain kind at different periods of time, and this can  only be accomplished by a study of catalogues.  The book-man likes to  think that history repeats itself in this as in other matters, and that  what has happened once will probably occur again in process of time.  Nay, he might, without any great stretch of credulity. persuade himself  that it must occur, if only he live long enough.  That's the rub, for  half a dozen lifetimes might not be sufficient to witness a return to  favour of, say, the ponderous works of the Fathers, which were in such  great demand a couple of centuries ago.  As of them, so of many other  kinds of books which are only read now by the very few.  Some day they  will rise again after their long sleep, but not for us.    As a corollary to this eulogy of catalogues, let us take a few of them  and see where the book-man's steps are leading him.  In his wanderings  abroad he must many a time be painfully conscious of the fact that his  own quest is that of everyone else whose tastes are similar to his own.

The prolongation of the War far beyond the calculation of those best able  to form an opinion on the subject has necessarily affected the plan of  Creswicke's \"South Africa and Transvaal War,\" and in consequence the  completion of the work in a manner satisfactory to subscribers, and  worthy of a book now widely recognised as a great History of the  Campaign, has been most carefully considered by both Author and  Publishers. They have decided to adhere closely to the plan of the work  sketched in the original prospectus; that is to say, Volume VI. will  bring to a close the History of the War so far as the annexation of the  Transvaal is concerned. All the important and daring movements that  culminated in the occupation of Lydenburg and the flight of Kruger are  treated in graphic detail. A condensed account is also given of the  subsequent Guerilla Warfare down to March 1901.    At the end of the Volume will be found the valuable Appendix matter  announced in Prospectus:--    (1.) =Gazetteer.= This gives in alphabetical order all the information  that is required as to places in South Africa. =Military terms are also  fully explained.=    (2.) =Biographical Record.= No attempt has been made elsewhere to deal  biographically in one list with the prominent actors connected with the  South African Campaign. This list, which would form in itself a good  sized volume crowded with facts, will be of permanent value.    (3.) =Recipients of the Victoria Cross=: giving details regarding those  who have earned this honour during the War up to the date of publication.    It is evident, however, that the Guerilla operations, spread over so  large an area as they are, would themselves furnish material for an  extensive book. In view, therefore, of the importance of this unique  development of the campaign, the military interest of the story, and the  many heroic deeds which deserve the fullest recognition possible, the  Publishers have decided to issue =an additional and strictly  supplementary Volume= dealing with Lord Kitchener's regime as  Commander-in-Chief and the Guerilla War. This additional volume will be  uniform as regards general style, number of illustrations, price, &c.,  and it is hoped that it will be found possible to include in it some  account of the ultimate settlement and the resources of the new Colonies.  The Publishers are confident that subscribers will find this a valuable  addition to the work.           *       *       *       *       *    Readers interested in this work are requested to assist the writer of the  narrative by forwarding authentic letters or accounts throwing light on  the military operations subsequent to Lord Roberts's departure from South  Africa.
