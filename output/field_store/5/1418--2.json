VOLUME 2.      CHAPTER 2.16.    LAKE OF TACARIGUA.  HOT SPRINGS OF MARIARA.  TOWN OF NUEVA VALENCIA DEL REY.  DESCENT TOWARDS THE COASTS OF PORTO CABELLO.    The valleys of Aragua form a narrow basin between granitic and  calcareous mountains of unequal height. On the north, they are  separated by the Sierra Mariara from the sea-coast; and towards the  south, the chain of Guacimo and Yusma serves them as a rampart against  the heated air of the steppes. Groups of hills, high enough to  determine the course of the waters, close this basin on the east and  west like transverse dykes. We find these hills between the Tuy and La  Victoria, as well as on the road from Valencia to Nirgua, and at the  mountains of Torito.* (* The lofty mountains of Los Teques, where the  Tuy takes its source, may be looked upon as the eastern boundary of  the valleys of Aragua. The level of the ground continues, in fact, to  rise from La Victoria to the Hacienda de Tuy; but the river Tuy,  turning southward in the direction of the sierras of Guairaima and  Tiara has found an issue on the east; and it is more natural to  consider as the limits of the basin of Aragua a line drawn through the  sources of the streams flowing into the lake of Valencia. The charts  and sections I have traced of the road from Caracas to Nueva Valencia,  and from Porto Cabello to Villa de Cura, exhibit the whole of these  geological relations.) From this extraordinary configuration of the  land, the little rivers of the valleys of Aragua form a peculiar  system, and direct their course towards a basin closed on all sides.  These rivers do not bear their waters to the ocean; they are collected  in a lake; and subject to the peculiar influence of evaporation, they  lose themselves, if we may use the expression, in the atmosphere. On  the existence of rivers and lakes, the fertility of the soil and the  produce of cultivation in these valleys depend. The aspect of the  spot, and the experience of half a century, have proved that the level  of the waters is not invariable; the waste by evaporation, and the  increase from the waters running into the lake, do not uninterruptedly  balance each other. The lake being elevated one thousand feet above  the neighbouring steppes of Calabozo, and one thousand three hundred  and thirty-two feet above the level of the ocean, it has been  suspected that there are subterranean communications and filtrations.  The appearance of new islands, and the gradual retreat of the waters,  have led to the belief that the lake may perhaps, in time, become  entirely dry. An assemblage of physical circumstances so remarkable  was well fitted to fix my attention on those valleys where the wild  beauty of nature is embellished by agricultural industry, and the arts  of rising civilization.    The lake of Valencia, called Tacarigua by the Indians, exceeds in  magnitude the lake of Neufchatel in Switzerland; but its general form  has more resemblance to the lake of Geneva, which is nearly at the  same height above the level of the sea. As the slope of the ground in  the valleys of Aragua tends towards the south and the west, that part  of the basin still covered with water is the nearest to the southern  chain of the mountains of Guigue, of Yusma, and of Guacimo, which  stretch towards the high savannahs of Ocumare. The opposite banks of  the lake of Valencia display a singular contrast; those on the south  are desert, and almost uninhabited, and a screen of high mountains  gives them a gloomy and monotonous aspect. The northern shore on the  contrary, is cheerful, pastoral, and decked with the rich cultivation  of the sugar-cane, coffee-tree, and cotton. Paths bordered with  cestrums, azedaracs, and other shrubs always in flower, cross the  plain, and join the scattered farms. Every house is surrounded by  clumps of trees. The ceiba with its large yellow flowers* (* Carnes  tollendas, Bombax hibiscifolius.) gives a peculiar character to the  landscape, mingling its branches with those of the purple erythrina.  This mixture of vivid vegetable colours contrasts finely with the  uniform tint of an unclouded sky. In the season of drought, where the  burning soil is covered with an undulating vapour, artificial  irrigations preserve verdure and promote fertility. Here and there the  granite rock pierces through the cultivated ground. Enormous stony  masses rise abruptly in the midst of the valley. Bare and forked, they  nourish a few succulent plants, which prepare mould for future ages.  Often on the summit of these lonely hills may be seen a fig-tree or a  clusia with fleshy leaves, which has fixed its roots in the rock, and  towers over the landscape. With their dead and withered branches,  these trees look like signals erected on a steep cliff. The form of  these mounts unfolds the secret of their ancient origin; for when the  whole of this valley was filled with water, and the waves beat at the  foot of the peaks of Mariara (the Devil's Nook* (* El Rincon del  Diablo.)) and the chain of the coast, these rocky hills were shoals or  islets.    These features of a rich landscape, these contrasts between the two  banks of the lake of Valencia, often reminded me of the Pays de Vaud,  where the soil, everywhere cultivated, and everywhere fertile, offers  the husbandman, the shepherd, and the vine-dresser, the secure fruit  of their labours, while, on the opposite side, Chablais presents only  a mountainous and half-desert country. In these distant climes  surrounded by exotic productions, I loved to recall to mind the  enchanting descriptions with which the aspect of the Leman lake and  the rocks of La Meillerie inspired a great writer. Now, while in the  centre of civilized Europe, I endeavour in my turn to paint the scenes  of the New World, I do not imagine I present the reader with clearer  images, or more precise ideas, by comparing our landscapes with those  of the equinoctial regions. It cannot be too often repeated that  nature, in every zone, whether wild or cultivated, smiling or  majestic, has an individual character. The impressions which she  excites are infinitely varied, like the emotions produced by works of  genius, according to the age in which they were conceived, and the  diversity of language from which they in part derive their charm. We  must limit our comparisons merely to dimensions and external form. We  may institute a parallel between the colossal summit of Mont Blanc and  the Himalaya Mountains; the cascades of the Pyrenees and those of the  Cordilleras: but these comparisons, useful with respect to science,  fail to convey an idea of the characteristics of nature in the  temperate and torrid zones. On the banks of a lake, in a vast forest,  at the foot of summits covered with eternal snow, it is not the mere  magnitude of the objects which excites our admiration. That which  speaks to the soul, which causes such profound and varied emotions,  escapes our measurements as it does the forms of language. Those who  feel powerfully the charms of nature cannot venture on comparing one  with another, scenes totally different in character.    But it is not alone the picturesque beauties of the lake of Valencia  that have given celebrity to its banks. This basin presents several  other phenomena, and suggests questions, the solution of which is  interesting alike to physical science and to the well-being of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7015"],[0,"Buddhist Psalms translated from the Japanese of Shinran Shonin (#1)"],[1,"OF THE EAST    BUDDHIST PSALMS    TRANSLATED FROM THE JAPANESE    OF    SHINRAN SHONIN    BY S.

ADAMS BECK    It is a singular fact that though many of the earlier Buddhist  Scriptures have been translated by competent scholars, comparatively  little attention has been paid to later Buddhist devotional  writings, and this although the developments of Buddhism in China  and Japan give them the deepest interest as reflecting the spiritual  mind of those two great countries. They cannot, however, be  understood without some knowledge of the faith which passed so  entirely into their life that in its growth it lost some of its own  infant traits and took on others, rooted, no doubt, in the  beginnings in India, but expanded and changed as the features of the  child may be forgotten in the face of the man and yet perpetuate the  unbroken succession of heredity. It is especially true that Japan  cannot be understood without some knowledge of the Buddhism of the  Greater Vehicle (as the developed form is called), for it was the  influence that moulded her youth as a nation, that shaped her  aspirations, and was the inspiration of her art, not only in the  written word, but in every art and higher handicraftsmanship that  makes her what she is. Whatever centuries may pass or the future  hold in store for her, Japan can never lose the stamp of Buddhism in  her outer or her spiritual life.    The world knows little as yet of the soul of Mahayana Buddhism,  though much of its outer observance, and for this reason a crucial  injustice has been done in regarding it merely as a degraded form of  the earlier Buddhism--a rank off-shoot of the teachings of the  Gautama Buddha, a system of idolatry and priestly power from which  the austere purity of the earlier faith has passed away.    The truth is that Buddhism, like Christianity, in every country  where it has sowed its seed and reaped its harvest, developed along  the lines indicated by the mind of that people. The Buddhism of  Japan differs from that of Tibet as profoundly as the Christianity  of Abyssinia from that of Scotland--yet both have conserved the  essential principle.    Buddhism was not a dead abstraction, but a living faith, and it  therefore grew and changed with the growth of the mind of man,  enlarging its perception of truth. As in the other great faiths, the  ascent of the Mount of Vision reveals worlds undreamed, and  proclaims what may seem to be new truths, but are only new aspects  of the Eternal. Japanese Buddhists still base their belief on the  utterances of the Buddhas, but they have enlarged their conception  of the truths so taught, and they hold that the new flower and fruit  spring from the roots that were planted in dim ages before the  Gautama Buddha taught in India, and have since rushed hundred-armed  to the sun. Such is the religious history of mankind, and Buddhism  obeys its sequence.    The development of Mahayana Buddhism from the teaching of the  Gautama Buddha has been often compared with that of the Christian  faith from the Jewish, but it may be better compared with the growth  of a sacerdotal system from the simplicities of the Gospel of  St. Mark. That the development should have been on the same lines in  all essential matters of symbol and (in the most important respects)  of doctrine, modified only by Eastern habits of thought and  environment, is a miracle of coincidence which cannot be paralleled  in the world unless it be granted that Christianity filtering along  the great trade routes of an earlier world joined hands with  Buddhism in many unsuspected ways and places. Evidence is  accumulating that this is so, and in a measure at present almost  incredible. And if it be so--if it be true that in spite of racial  distinctions, differences of thought and circumstance, the religious  thought of East and West has so many and so great meeting-points,  the hope of the world in things spiritual may lie in the recognition  of that fact and in a future union now shadowed forth only in symbol  and in a great hope. This, however, is no essay on Buddhism, either  earlier or later, and what I have said is necessary to the  introduction of these Jodo-Wasan, or Psalms of the Pure Land, which  are a part not only of the literature, but also of the daily worship  and spiritual life of Japan. Their history may be briefly told.    Buddhism passed into Japan from China and Korea about 1320 years  ago, in or about the year A.D. 552. It adapted itself with perfect  comprehension to the ideals of the Japanese people, inculcating  among them the teachings of morality common to the great faiths  with, in addition, the spiritual unction, the passion of love and  sympathy, self-devotion, and compassion, in which Buddhism and  Christianity are alike pre-eminent. The negative side of Buddhism,  with its passionless calm and self-renunciation, is the only one  that has been realised in the West, and the teachings of Mahayana  which have borne fruit and flower, visible to all the world, of  happiness, courtesy, kindliness in the spiritual attitude of a whole  people, have never received the honour which was their due.    For with the Buddhist faith there came the germ of the belief that  the Gautama Buddha in his own grandeur bore witness to One  Greater--the Amitabha or Amida Buddha--that One who in boundless  light abideth, life of the Universe, without colour, without form,  the Lover of man, his Protector and Refuge. He may, He must be  worshipped, for in Him are all the essential attributes of Deity,  and He, the Saviour of mankind, has prepared a pure land of peace  for his servants, beyond the storms of life and death. This belief  eventually crystallised and became a dogma in the faith of the Pure  Land, known in Japan as Jodo Shinshu, a faith held by the majority  of the Japanese people. It is a Belief which has spread also in  Eastern Siberia, many parts of China, Hawaii, and, in fact,  whereever the Japanese race has spread. And the man who stated this  belief for all time was Shinran Shonin, author of the Psalms here  presented.    He was born in the year A.D. 1175 near City-Royal--Kyoto, the  ancient capital of Japan. He was a son of one of the noblest  families, in close connection with the Imperial House, and had it  not been for the passion for truth and the life of the spirit which  consumed him, his history would have been that of the many other  brilliant young men who sank into mere courtiers--\"Dwellers above  the Clouds,\" as the royalties and courtiers of the day were called  among the people. But the clear air above the clouds in which his  spirit spread its wings was not that of City-Royal, and the Way  opened before him as it has opened before many a saint of the  Christian Church, for while still a child he lost both his parents,  and so, meditating on the impermanence of mortal life, and seeing  how the fashion of this world passes away, he abandoned his title  and became a monk in one of the noble monasteries whose successors  still stand glorious among the pine woods above Lake Biwa.    These were not only monasteries, but seats of learning, as in Europe  in the Middle Ages, and here the Doctrines were subjected to  brilliant analysis and logical subtleties which had almost  superseded the living faith. In that cold atmosphere the spirit of  Shiran Shonin could not spread its wings, though for twenty years he  gave his thoughts to its empty glitter. Therefore, at the age of  twenty-nine he cast it all behind him, and in deep humility cast  himself at the feet of the great Teacher Honen, who, in the shades  of Higashiyama, was setting forth the saving power of the Eternal  One who abideth in the Light and in whom is no darkness--the Buddha  of Boundless Light. And in this place and from this man Shinran  received enlightenment.    Life now lay before him as a problem. Unlike as the two men are in  character and methods, his position resembled that of Martin Luther  on quitting the Church of Rome. For the Buddhist monastic rule  requires its members to be homeless, celibate, vegetarian, and here,  like Luther, Shinran joined issue with them. To his mind the  attainment of man lay in the harmonious development of body and  spirit, and in the fulfilment, not the negation of the ordinary  human duties. Accordingly, in his thirty-first year, after deep  consideration, he married the daughter of Prince Kujo Kanezane,  Chief Minister of the Emperor and head of one of the greatest houses  in Japan, and in that happy union he tasted four years of simple  domestic joy, during which a son was born to him. Then the storm  broke.    Trouble was stirred up by the orthodox Buddhist Church with evil  reports which reached the ears of the Emperor, and Shinran was sent  into banishment in the lonely and primitive province of Echigo--a  terrible alternative for a man of noble birth and refined  culture. He took it, however, with perfect serenity as a mission to  those untaught and neglected people, and into their darkness he  brought the light of the Father of Lights, and the people flocked to  the warmth and wonder of the new hope, and heard"]]]
