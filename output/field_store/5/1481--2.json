We might well be voicing the words of Saint Paul which were  recorded in his Second Letter to the Corinthians, Chapter I) verse 8:    \"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which  came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above  strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life!\"    Of his First Guerrilla Regiment, General Douglas MacArthur stated that  \"He had acquired a force behind the Japanese lines that would have a  far reaching effect on the war in the days to come\"; that it had kept  \"Freedom's Flames burning brightly throughout the Philippines\"; that  it had produced a \"human drama with few parallels in military  history\"; and later, during the landing in Lingayen Gulf, had  \"accomplished the purposes of practically a front line division.\"    MacArthur further stated that \"the courageous and splendid resistance  maintained by you and your command filled me with pride and  satisfaction.\"    Of the Hell Ship Oryoku Maru, Gen. James O. Gillespie stated \"it was  probably the most horrible story of suffering endured by prisoners of  war during World War II.\"    Gen. John Beall further stated, \"You say a lot of things that need to  be said, lest the United States forgets the horrors of the way the  Japanese treated our prisoners.\"    In writing Blood Brothers, I found it necessary to resort to frequent  flashbacks; and to keep the reader aware of the history taking place  around the world, I tried to make reference to these events as they  happened, even when they were merely rumors.       This story has not been pleasant to write; I'm glad it is finally  finished.    In Blood Brothers, there are no heroes. The survivors of the  Philippines arrived home in 1945, quietly and without recognition, to  be admitted to hospitals near their homes.    With winners and heroes everywhere, there was no time for \"Losers.\"      Eugene C. Jacobs    \"Our senses can grasp nothing that is extreme! Too much noise deafens  us! Too much light blinds us! Too far or too near prevents our seeing!  Too long or too short is beyond understanding! Too much truth stuns  us!\"    Blaise Pascal      *General Harold K. Johnson, a former Chief of Staff of the United  States Army, had been a former Japanese prisoner-of-war, had  experienced each and every event as it happened to other P.O.W.s, and  had been an excellent friend through more than thirty years of Army  service; he had agreed to write this PREFACE; unfortunately, this was  followed by a long hospitalization ending in terminal cancer.

I knew that within another 6 to 8 months, we would all be dead,  and there would be no record of it. There was no paper to keep any  record of events.    Within a few weeks, I was able to obtain a\" nickel school notebook. In  it, I drew many sketches, depicting the lifestyle in prison camp.    Of course, I had to be secretive. There was a penalty for keeping  records in camp; if I'd been caught, I would have been beheaded.    By the time we were being processed for transfer to Old Bilibid Prison  in late October 1944, I had made some 110 sketches. I rolled them up  and placed them in a Mason jar. I buried the jar at the east end of  building No. 12, planning to come back after the war and dig it up.                                       ...    When the war was over, I was flown from Mukden, Manchuria to Kunming,  China and on to Manila, P.I., where I was housed in a tent at Reple  Depot # 29 south of the city. The next day I was flown in a Piper Cub  back to Cabanatuan to look for my drawings, landing at an airfield we  had built as prisoner-labor. A battalion of Engineers furnished a  bulldozer.    The camp buildings were all gone. I figured out where building # 12  had been. We dug for hours and found nothing.    As fate would have it, one year after I returned to Active Duty at  Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C., I located my 110  sketches at the Pentagon. MacArthur's Sixth Army Rangers had retrieved  the buried drawings when they liberated Camp #1 in late January 1945.    All of my sketches had been carefully numbered, and marked on the back  \"Unidentified Artist.\" I had been officially declared an artist.                                 INTRODUCTION           In Japanese prisoner of war camps, all prisoners were divided into  groups of ten, called \"blood brothers.\"       If anyone of the ten \"blood brothers\" made any attempt to escape,  the other nine would be punished \"Sevelery!\"       Typical punishments:       Tie the blood brothers to fence posts and require each passing  Japanese soldier to slap and kick them.       More severe punishment required recruits to use the bound brothers  for bayonet practice.       The most severe punishment required an officer to unsheathe his  samurai sword and behead the \"brothers.\"       My ten blood brothers, all Medical Officers of the Regular Army,  were:       Lt. Col. William Draper North       Major James Bahrenberg    Wilbur Berry    Wesley Bertz*    Eugene Jacobs    Emmert Lentz    Steven Sitter    Clarence Strand *    Clarence White*    Captain Robert Lewis      The blood brothers with the asterisk (*) were killed or died on \"Hell  Ships\" enroute to Japan.    The other brothers survived the rigors of Bataan, the \"Death March\"  Japanese prison camps, labor details, the \"farm,\" and \"Hell Ships\" to  return to the United States. Since the war, all have died, except the  author, who is anxious to tell his story before the first reunion of  the \"brothers.\"             STAFF Camp John Hay Baguio, Mountain Province, P.I.

Half-asleep, I raised the receiver:    \"WE ARE AT WAR WITH JAPAN! PEARL HARBOR IS BEING BOMBED! REPORT TO  HEADQUARTERS AT ONCE!\" It was 0500 hours, December 8th, 1941.    Hawaiian time, it was 1030 hours, December 7th. The bombing was still  going on, lasting from 0755 to 1050 hours.    Greatly surprised and quite groggy, I tried to collect my thoughts  while getting into my freshly starched uniform, Medical Corps, U.S.  Army: \"Knocking out the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor could clear the  way for Japan to conquer the Philippine Islands, without any outside  interference. Of all the Pacific territories of the United States, the  Japanese most wanted the Philippines. General MacArthur, as well as  the Japanese, believed that the Philippine Islands were the 'Key to  the Orient'; Japan would have to take the Philippines before  attempting to conquer any other countries in Southeast Asia. Some Navy  admirals had recently remarked that the 'Pacific Fleet belongs in San  Diego!' If the Japanese should sink one ship in Pearl Harbor (the  so-called Mouse Trap), they could bottle up the entire fleet. Now,  with the Pacific Fleet crippled, there could be no rescue attempt.

As may be seen in our sketch, the comet is seen in Egypt in all its  magnificence, and the sight in the early morning from the pyramids (our  sketch was taken at 4 A.M.) is described as unusually grand.--_London  Graphic_.    [Illustration: THE COMET AS SEEN FROM THE GREAT PYRAMIDS, NEAR CAIRO,  EGYPT.]           *       *       *       *       *      [NATURE.]          JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE.      James Prescott Joule was born at Salford, on Christmas Eve of the year  1818. His father and his grandfather before him were brewers, and the  business, in due course, descended to Mr. Joule and his elder brother,  and by them was carried on with success till it was sold, in 1854.  Mr. Joule's grandfather came from Elton, in Derbyshire, settled near  Manchester, where he founded the business, and died at the age of  fifty-four, in 1799. His father, one of a numerous family, married a  daughter of John Prescott of Wigan. They had five children, of  whom James Prescott Joule was the second, and of whom three were  sons--Benjamin, the eldest, James, and John--and two daughters--Alice  and Mary. Mr. Joule's mother died in 1836 at the age of forty-eight; and  his father, who was an invalid for many years before his death, died at  the age of seventy-four, in the year 1858.    Young Joule was a delicate child, and was not sent to school. His early  education was commenced by his mother's half sister, and was carried  on at his father's house, Broomhill, Pendlebury, by tutors till he was  about fifteen years of age. At fifteen he commenced working in the  brewery, which, as his father's health declined, fell entirely into the  hands of his brother Benjamin and himself.    Mr. Joule obtained his first instruction in physical science from  Dalton, to whom his father sent the two brothers to learn chemistry.  Dalton, one of the most distinguished chemists of any age or country,  was then President of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,  and lived and received pupils in the rooms of the Society's house. Many  of his most important memoirs were communicated to the Society, whose  _Transactions_ are likewise enriched by a large number of communications  from his distinguished pupil. Dalton's instruction to the two young men  commenced with arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. He then taught them  natural philosophy out of Cavallo's text-book, and afterward, but only  for a short time before his health gave way, in 1837, chemistry from his  own \"New System of Chemical Philosophy.\" \"Profound, patient, intuitive,\"  his teaching must have had great influence on his pupils. We find Mr.  Joule early at work on the molecular constitution of gases, following in  the footsteps of his illustrious master, whose own investigations on the  constitution of mixed gases, and on the behavior of vapors and gases  under heat, were among the most important of his day, and whose  brilliant discovery of the atomic theory revolutionized the science of  chemistry and placed him at the head of the philosophical chemists of  Europe.    [Illustration: JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE.]    Under Dalton, Mr. Joule first became acquainted with physical apparatus;  and the interest excited in his mind very soon began to produce fruit.  Almost immediately he commenced experimenting on his own account.  Obtaining a room in his father's house for the purpose, he began by  constructing a cylinder electric machine in a very primitive way. A  glass tube served for the cylinder; a poker hung up by silk threads, as  in the very oldest forms of electric machine, was the prime conductor;  and for a Leyden jar he went back to the old historical jar of Cunaeus,  and used a bottle half filled with water, standing in an outer vessel,  which contained water also.    Enlarging his stock of apparatus, chiefly by the work of his own hands,  he soon entered the ranks as an investigator, and original papers  followed each other in quick succession. The Royal Society list now  contains, the titles of ninety-seven papers due to Joule, exclusive of  over twenty very important papers detailing researches undertaken by him  conjointly with Thomson, with Lyon Playfair, and with Scoresby.    Mr. Joule's first investigations were in the field of magnetism. In  1838, at the age of nineteen, he constructed an electro-magnetic engine,  which he described in Sturgeon's \"Annals of Electricity\" for January  of that year. In the same year, and in the three years following, he  constructed other electro-magnetic machines and electro-magnets of novel  forms; and experimenting with the new apparatus, he obtained results  of great importance in the theory of electro-magnetism. In 1840 he  discovered and determined the value of the limit to the magnetization  communicable to soft iron by the electric current; showing for the case  of an electro-magnet supporting weight, that when the exciting current  is made stronger and stronger, the sustaining power tends to a certain  definite limit, which, according to his estimate, amounts to about  140 lb. per square inch of either of the attracting surfaces.  He investigated the relative values of solid iron cores for the  electro-magnetic machine, as compared with bundles of iron wire; and,  applying the principles which he had discovered, he proceeded to the  construction of electro-magnets of much greater lifting power than any  previously made, while he studied also the methods of modifying the  distribution of the force in the magnetic field.    In commencing these investigations he was met at the very outset, as he  tells us, with \"the difficulty, if not impossibility, of understanding  experiments and comparing them with one another, which arises in general  from incomplete descriptions of apparatus, and from the arbitrary and  vague numbers which are used to characterize electric currents. Such a  practice,\" he says, \"might be tolerated in the infancy of science; but  in its present state of advancement greater precision and propriety"]]]
