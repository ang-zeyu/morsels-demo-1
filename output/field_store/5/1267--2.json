The elderly gentleman--his hair was quite  white now--slowly shook his head, as he murmured again:    \"It can't be done, Tom! It can't be done! I admit that you've made  a lot of wonderful things--things I never dreamed of--but this is  too much. To transmit pictures over a telephone wire, so that  persons cannot only see to whom they are talking, as well as hear  them--well, to be frank with you, Tom, I should be sorry to see  you waste your time trying to invent such a thing.\"    \"I don't agree with you. Not only do I think it can be done, but  I'm going to do it. In fact, I've already started on it. As for  wasting my time, well, I haven't anything in particular to do, now  that my giant cannon has been perfected, so I might as well be  working on my new photo telephone instead of sitting around idle.\"    \"Yes, Tom, I agree with you there,\" said Mr. Swift. \"Sitting  around idle isn't good for anyone--man or boy, young or old. So  don't think I'm finding fault because you're busy.\"    \"It's only that I don't want to see you throw away your efforts,  only to be disappointed in the end. It can't be done, Tom, it  can't be done,\" and the aged inventor shook his head in pitying  doubt.    Tom only smiled confidently, and went on:    \"Well, Dad, all you'll have to do will be to wait and see. It  isn't going to be easy--I grant that. In fact, I've run up against  more snags, the little way I've gone so far, than I like to admit.  But I'm going to stick at it, and before this year is out I'll  guarantee, Father, that you can be at one end of the telephone  wire, talking to me, at the other, and I'll see you and you'll see  me--if not as plainly as we see each other now, at least plainly  enough to make sure of each other.\"    Mr. Swift chuckled silently, gradually breaking into a louder  laugh. Instead of being angry, Tom only regarded his father with  an indulgent smile, and continued:    \"All right, Dad. Go ahead, laugh!\"    \"Well, Tom, I'm not exactly laughing at YOU--it's more at the  idea than anything else. The idea of talking over a wire and, at  the same time, having light waves, as well as electrical waves  passing on the same conductor!\"    \"All right, Dad, go ahead and laugh. I don't mind,\" said Tom,  good-naturedly. \"Folks laughed at Bell, when he said he could send  a human voice over a copper spring; but Bell went ahead and to-day  we can talk over a thousand miles by wire. That was the telephone.\"    \"Folks laughed at Morse when he said he could send a message over  the wire. He let 'em laugh, but we have the telegraph. Folks  laughed at Edison, when he said he could take the human voice--or  any other sound--and fix it on a wax cylinder or a hard-rubber  plate--but he did it, and we have the phonograph. And folks  laughed at Santos Dumont, at the Wrights, and at all the other  fellows, who said they could take a heavier-than-air machine, and  skim above the clouds like a bird; but we do it--I've done it--you've  done it.\"    \"Hold on, Tom!\" protested Mr. Swift. \"I give up! Don't rub it in  on your old dad. I admit that folks did laugh at those inventors,  with their seemingly impossible schemes, but they made good. And  you've made good lots of times where I thought you wouldn't. But  just stop to consider for a moment. This thing of sending a  picture over a telephone wire is totally out of the question, and  entirely opposed to all the principles of science.\"    \"What do I care for principles of science?\" cried Tom, and he  strode about the room so rapidly that Eradicate, the old colored  servant, who came in with the mail, skipped out of the library  with the remark:    \"Deed, an' Massa Tom must be pow'fully preragitated dis mawnin'!\"    \"Some of the scientists said it was totally opposed to all natural  laws when I planned my electric rifle,\" went on Tom. \"But I made  it, and it shot. They said my air glider would never stay up, but  she did.\"    \"But, Tom, this is different. You are talking of sending light  waves--one of the most delicate forms of motion in the world--over  a material wire. It can't be done!\"    \"Look here, Dad!\" exclaimed Tom, coming to a halt in front of his  parent. \"What is light, anyhow? Merely another form of motion;  isn't it?\"    \"Well, yes, Tom, I suppose it is.\"    \"Of course it is,\" said Tom. \"With vibrations of a certain length  and rapidity we get sound--the faster the vibration per second the  higher the sound note. Now, then, we have sound waves, or  vibrations, traveling at the rate of a mile in a little less than  five seconds; that is, with the air at a temperature of sixty  degrees. With each increase of a degree of temperature we get an  increase of about a foot per second in the rapidity with which  sound travels.\"    \"Now, then, light shoots along at the rate of 186,000,000 miles a  second. That is more than many times around the earth in a second  of time. So we have sound, one kind of wave motion, or energy; we  have light, a higher degree of vibration or wave motion, and then  we come to electricity--and nobody has ever yet exactly measured  the intensity or speed of the electric vibrations.\"    \"But what I'm getting at is this--that electricity must travel  pretty nearly as fast as light--if not faster. So I believe that  electricity and light have about the same kind of vibrations, or  wave motion.\"    \"Now, then, if they do have--and I admit it's up to me to prove  it,\" went on Tom, earnestly--\"why can't I send light-waves over a  wire, as well as electrical waves?\"    Mr. Swift was silent for a moment. Then he said, slowly:    \"Well, Tom, I never heard it argued just that way before. Maybe  there's something in your photo telephone after all. But it never  has been done. You can't deny that!\"    He looked at his son triumphantly. It was not because he wanted to  get the better of him in argument, that Mr. Swift held to his own  views; but he wanted to bring out the best that was in his  offspring. Tom accepted the challenge instantly.    \"Yes, Dad, it has been done, in a way!\" he said, earnestly. \"No  one has sent a picture over a telephone wire, as far as I know,  but during the recent hydroplane tests at Monte Carlo, photographs  taken of some of the events in the morning, and afternoon, were  developed in the evening, and transmitted over five hundred miles  of wire to Paris, and those same photographs were published in the  Paris newspapers the next morning.\"    \"Is that right, Tom?\"    \"It certainly is. The photographs weren't so very clear, but you  could make out what they were. Of course that is a different  system than the one I'm thinking of. In that case they took a  photograph, and made a copper plate of it, as they would for a  half-tone illustration. This gave them a picture with ridges and  depressions in copper, little hills and valleys, so to speak,  according to whether there were light or dark tints in the  picture. The dark places meant that the copper lines stood up  higher there than where there were light colors.\"    \"Now, by putting this copper plate on a wooden drum, and revolving  this drum, with an electrical needle pressing lightly on the  ridges of copper, they got a varying degree of electrical current.  Where the needle touched a high place in the copper plate the  contact was good, and there was a strong current. When the needle  got to a light place in the copper--a depression, so to speak--the  contact was not so good, and there was only a weak current.\"    \"At the receiving end of the apparatus there was a sensitized film  placed on a similar wooden drum. This was to receive the image  that came over the five hundred miles of wire. Now then, as the  electrical needle, moving across the copper plate, made electrical  contacts of different degrees of strength, it worked a delicate  galvanometer on the receiving end. The galvanometer caused a beam  of light to vary--to grow brighter or dimmer, according as the  electrical current was stronger or weaker. And this light, falling  on the sensitive plate, made a picture, just like the one on the  copper plate in Monte Carlo.\"    \"In other words, where the copper plate was black, showing that  considerable printing ink was needed, the negative on the other  end was made light. Then when that negative was printed it would  come out black, because more light comes through the light places  on a photograph negative than through the dark places. And so,  with the galvanometer making light flashes on the sensitive plate,  the galvanometer being governed by the electrical contacts five  hundred miles away, they transmitted a photograph by wire.\"    \"But not a telephone wire, Tom.\"    \"That doesn't make any difference, Dad. It was a wire just the  same. But I'm not going into that just now, though later I may  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#1)"],[1,"(www.ccel.org) collection.

In Germany, we find Mechthild of Magdeburg (d. 1277),  Meister Eckhart (d. 1327), Johannes Tauler (d. 1361), and Heinrich  Suso (d. 1365); in Flanders, Jan Ruysbroek (d. 1381); in Italy,  Dante Alighieri himself (d. 1321), Jacopone da Todi (d. 1306), St.  Catherine of Siena (d. 1380), and many lesser writers who strove, in  prose or in poetry, to express the hidden things of the spirit, the  secret intercourse of the human soul with the Divine, no longer in  the official Latin of the Church, but in the language of their own  people, \"a man's own vernacular,\" which \"is nearest to him, inasmuch  as it is most closely united to him.\"[1] In England, the great names  of Richard Rolle, the Hermit of Hampole (d. 1349), of Walter Hilton  (d. 1396), and of Mother Juliana of Norwich, whose Revelation of  Divine Love professedly date from 1373, speak for themselves.    The seven tracts or treatises before us were published in 1521 in a  little quarto volume: \"Imprynted at London in Poules chyrchyarde at  the sygne of the Trynyte, by Henry Pepwell. In the yere of our lorde  God, M.CCCCC.XXI., the xvi. daye of Nouembre.\" They may, somewhat  loosely speaking, be regarded as belonging to the fourteenth  century, though the first and longest of them professes to be but a  translation of the work of the great Augustinian mystic of an  earlier age.    St. Bernard, Richard of St. Victor, and St. Bonaventura--all three  very familiar figures to students of Dante's Paradiso--are the chief  influences in the story of English mysticism. And, through the  writings of his latter-day followers, Richard Rolle, Walter Hilton,  and the anonymous author of the Divine Cloud of Unknowing, Richard  of St. Victor is, perhaps, the most important of the three.    Himself either a Scot or an Irishman by birth, Richard entered the  famous abbey of St. Victor, a house of Augustinian canons near  Paris, some time before 1140, where he became the chief pupil of the  great mystical doctor and theologian whom the later Middle Ages  regarded as a second Augustine, Hugh of St. Victor. After Hugh's  death (1141), Richard succeeded to his influence as a teacher, and  completed his work in creating the mystical theology of the Church.  His masterpiece, De Gratia Contemplationis, known also as Benjamin  Major, in five books, is a work of marvellous spiritual insight,  unction, and eloquence, upon which Dante afterwards based the whole  mystical psychology of the Paradiso.2 In it Richard shows how the  soul passes upward through the six steps of contemplation--in  imagination, in reason, in understanding--gradually discarding all  sensible objects of thought; until, in the sixth stage, it  contemplates what is above reason, and seems to be beside reason, or  even contrary to reason. He teaches that there are three qualities  of contemplation, according to its intensity: mentis dilatatio, an  enlargement of the soul's vision without exceeding the bounds of  human activity; mentis sublevatio, elevation of mind, in which the  intellect, divinely illumined, transcends the measure of humanity,  and beholds the things above itself, but does not entirely lose  self-consciousness; and mentis alienatio, or ecstasy, in which all  memory of the present leaves the mind, and it passes into a state of  divine transfiguration, in which the soul gazes upon truth without  any veils of creatures, not in a mirror darkly, but in its pure  simplicity. This master of the spiritual life died in 1173. Amongst  the glowing souls of the great doctors and theologians in the fourth  heaven, St. Thomas Aquinas bids Dante mark the ardent spirit of  \"Richard who in contemplation was more than man.\"[3]    Benjamin, for Richard, is the type of contemplation, in accordance  with the Vulgate version of Psalm lxvii.: Ibi Benjamin  adolescentulus in mentis excessu: \"There is Benjamin, a youth, in  ecstasy of mind\"--where the English Bible reads: \"Little Benjamin  their ruler.\"[4] At the birth of Benjamin, his mother Rachel dies:  \"For, when the mind of man is rapt above itself, it surpasseth all  the limits of human reasoning. Elevated above itself and rapt in  ecstasy, it beholdeth things in the divine light at which all human  reason succumbs. What, then, is the death of Rachel, save the  failing of reason?\"[5]    The treatise here printed under the title Benjamin is based upon a  smaller work of Richard's, a kind of introduction to the Benjamin  Major, entitled: Benjamin Minor; or: De Praeparatione animi ad  Contemplationem. It is a paraphrase of certain portions of this  work, with a few additions, and large omissions. Among the portions  omitted are the two passages that, almost alone among Richard's  writings, are known to the general reader--or, at least, to people  who do not claim to be specialists in mediaeval theology. In the  one, he speaks of knowledge of self as the Holy Hill, the Mountain  of the Lord:--    \"If the mind would fain ascend to the height of science, let its  first and principal study be to know itself. Full knowledge of the  rational spirit is a great and high mountain. This mountain  transcends all the peaks of all mundane sciences, and looks down  upon all the philosophy and all the science of the world from on  high. Could Aristotle, could Plato, could the great band of  philosophers ever attain to it?\"[6]    In the other, still adhering to his image of the mountain of  self-knowledge, he makes his famous appeal to the Bible, as the  supreme test of truth, the only sure guard that the mystic has  against being deluded in his lofty speculations:--    \"Even if you think that you have been taken up into that high  mountain apart, even if you think that you see Christ transfigured,  do not be too ready to believe anything you see in Him or hear from  Him, unless Moses and Elias run to meet Him. I hold all truth in  suspicion which the authority of the Scriptures does not confirm,  nor do I receive Christ in His clarification unless Moses and Elias  are talking with Him.\"[7]    On the other hand, the beautiful passage with which the version  closes, so typical of the burning love of Christ, shown in devotion  to the name of Jesus, which glows through all the writings of the  school of the Hermit of Hampole, is an addition of the translator:--    \"And therefore, what so thou be that covetest to come to  contemplation of God, that is to say, to bring forth such a child  that men clepen in the story Benjamin (that is to say, sight of  God), then shalt thou use thee in this manner. Thou shalt call  together thy thoughts and thy desires, and make thee of them a  church, and learn thee therein for to love only this good word Jesu,  so that all thy desires and all thy thoughts are only set for to  love Jesu, and that unceasingly as it may be here; so that thou  fulfil that is said in the psalm: 'Lord, I shall bless Thee in  churches'; that is, in thoughts and desires of the love of Jesu. And  then, in this church of thoughts and desires, and in this onehead of  studies and of wills, look that all thy thoughts, and all thy  desires, and all thy studies, and all thy wills be only set in the  love and the praising of this Lord Jesu, without forgetting, as far  forth as thou mayst by"]]]
