The garret was a shadowy, suggestive, delightful place, as all garrets  should be. Through the open window, by which Anne sat, blew the sweet,  scented, sun-warm air of the August afternoon; outside, poplar boughs  rustled and tossed in the wind; beyond them were the woods, where  Lover's Lane wound its enchanted path, and the old apple orchard which  still bore its rosy harvests munificently.  And, over all, was a great  mountain range of snowy clouds in the blue southern sky.  Through the  other window was glimpsed a distant, white-capped, blue sea--the  beautiful St. Lawrence Gulf, on which floats, like a jewel, Abegweit,  whose softer, sweeter Indian name has long been forsaken for the more  prosaic one of Prince Edward Island.    Diana Wright, three years older than when we last saw her, had grown  somewhat matronly in the intervening time.  But her eyes were as black  and brilliant, her cheeks as rosy, and her dimples as enchanting, as in  the long-ago days when she and Anne Shirley had vowed eternal  friendship in the garden at Orchard Slope.  In her arms she held a  small, sleeping, black-curled creature, who for two happy years had  been known to the world of Avonlea as \"Small Anne Cordelia.\"  Avonlea  folks knew why Diana had called her Anne, of course, but Avonlea folks  were puzzled by the Cordelia.  There had never been a Cordelia in the  Wright or Barry connections.  Mrs. Harmon Andrews said she supposed  Diana had found the name in some trashy novel, and wondered that Fred  hadn't more sense than to allow it.  But Diana and Anne smiled at each  other.  They knew how Small Anne Cordelia had come by her name.    \"You always hated geometry,\" said Diana with a retrospective smile.  \"I  should think you'd be real glad to be through with teaching, anyhow.\"    \"Oh, I've always liked teaching, apart from geometry.  These past three  years in Summerside have been very pleasant ones. Mrs. Harmon Andrews  told me when I came home that I wouldn't likely find married life as  much better than teaching as I expected.  Evidently Mrs. Harmon is of  Hamlet's opinion that it may be better to bear the ills that we have  than fly to others that we know not of.\"    Anne's laugh, as blithe and irresistible as of yore, with an added note  of sweetness and maturity, rang through the garret.  Marilla in the  kitchen below, compounding blue plum preserve, heard it and smiled;  then sighed to think how seldom that dear laugh would echo through  Green Gables in the years to come.  Nothing in her life had ever given  Marilla so much happiness as the knowledge that Anne was going to marry  Gilbert Blythe; but every joy must bring with it its little shadow of  sorrow.  During the three Summerside years Anne had been home often for  vacations and weekends; but, after this, a bi-annual visit would be as  much as could be hoped for.    \"You needn't let what Mrs. Harmon says worry you,\" said Diana, with the  calm assurance of the four-years matron.  \"Married life has its ups and  downs, of course.  You mustn't expect that everything will always go  smoothly.  But I can assure you, Anne, that it's a happy life, when  you're married to the right man.\"    Anne smothered a smile.  Diana's airs of vast experience always amused  her a little.    \"I daresay I'll be putting them on too, when I've been married four  years,\" she thought.  \"Surely my sense of humor will preserve me from  it, though.\"    \"Is it settled yet where you are going to live?\" asked Diana, cuddling  Small Anne Cordelia with the inimitable gesture of motherhood which  always sent through Anne's heart, filled with sweet, unuttered dreams  and hopes, a thrill that was half pure pleasure and half a strange,  ethereal pain.    \"Yes. That was what I wanted to tell you when I 'phoned to you to come  down today.  By the way, I can't realize that we really have telephones  in Avonlea now.  It sounds so preposterously up-to-date and modernish  for this darling, leisurely old place.\"    \"We can thank the A. V. I. S. for them,\" said Diana.  \"We should never  have got the line if they hadn't taken the matter up and carried it  through.  There was enough cold water thrown to discourage any society.  But they stuck to it, nevertheless.  You did a splendid thing for  Avonlea when you founded that society, Anne.  What fun we did have at  our meetings!  Will you ever forget the blue hall and Judson Parker's  scheme for painting medicine advertisements on his fence?\"    \"I don't know that I'm wholly grateful to the A. V. I.  S. in the  matter of the telephone,\" said Anne.  \"Oh, I know it's most  convenient--even more so than our old device of signalling to each  other by flashes of candlelight!  And, as Mrs. Rachel says, 'Avonlea  must keep up with the procession, that's what.'  But somehow I feel as  if I didn't want Avonlea spoiled by what Mr. Harrison, when he wants to  be witty, calls 'modern inconveniences.'  I should like to have it kept  always just as it was in the dear old years. That's foolish--and  sentimental--and impossible.  So I shall immediately become wise and  practical and possible.  The telephone, as Mr. Harrison concedes, is 'a  buster of a good thing'--even if you do know that probably half a dozen  interested people are listening along the line.\"    \"That's the worst of it,\" sighed Diana.  \"It's so annoying to hear the  receivers going down whenever you ring anyone up.  They say Mrs. Harmon  Andrews insisted that their 'phone should be put in their kitchen just  so that she could listen whenever it rang and keep an eye on the dinner  at the same time.  Today, when you called me, I distinctly heard that  queer clock of the Pyes' striking.  So no doubt Josie or Gertie was  listening.\"    \"Oh, so that is why you said, 'You've got a new clock at Green Gables,  haven't you?'  I couldn't imagine what you meant.  I heard a vicious  click as soon as you had spoken.  I suppose it was the Pye receiver  being hung up with profane energy.  Well, never mind the Pyes.  As Mrs.  Rachel says, 'Pyes they always were and Pyes they always will be, world  without end, amen.'  I want to talk of pleasanter things.  It's all  settled as to where my new home shall be.\"    \"Oh, Anne, where?  I do hope it's near here.\"    \"No-o-o, that's the drawback. Gilbert is going to settle at Four Winds  Harbor--sixty miles from here.\"    \"Sixty!  It might as well be six hundred,\" sighed Diana.  \"I never can  get further from home now than Charlottetown.\"    \"You'll have to come to Four Winds. It's the most beautiful harbor on  the Island.  There's a little village called Glen St. Mary at its head,  and Dr. David Blythe has been practicing there for fifty years.  He is  Gilbert's great-uncle, you know.  He is going to retire, and Gilbert is  to take over his practice.  Dr. Blythe is going to keep his house,  though, so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves.  I don't  know yet what it is, or where it will be in reality, but I have a  little house o'dreams all furnished in my imagination--a tiny,  delightful castle in Spain.\"    \"Where are you going for your wedding tour?\" asked Diana.    \"Nowhere.  Don't look horrified, Diana dearest.  You suggest Mrs.  Harmon Andrews.  She, no doubt, will remark condescendingly that people  who can't afford wedding 'towers' are real sensible not to take them;  and then she'll remind me that Jane went to Europe for hers.  I want to  spend MY honeymoon at Four Winds in my own dear house of dreams.\"    \"And you've decided not to have any bridesmaid?\"    \"There isn't any one to have.  You and Phil and Priscilla and Jane all  stole a march on me in the matter of marriage; and Stella is teaching  in Vancouver.  I have no other 'kindred soul' and I won't have a  bridesmaid who isn't.\"    \"But you are going to wear a veil, aren't you?\" asked Diana, anxiously.    \"Yes, indeedy.  I shouldn't feel like a bride without one.  I remember  telling Matthew, that evening when he brought me to Green Gables, that  I never expected to be a bride because I was so homely no one would  ever want to marry me--unless some foreign missionary did.  I had an  idea then that foreign missionaries couldn't afford to be finicky in  the matter of looks if they wanted a girl to risk her life among  cannibals.

Thou knowest well from what this book arose.          When suffering seized and held me in its clasp          Thy fostering hand released me from its grasp,          And from amid the thorns there bloomed a rose.          Air, dew, and sunshine were bestowed by Thee,          And Thine it is; without these lines from me.          PREFACE.    In the winter of 1873 I spent some weeks in one of the tombs of the  Necropolis of Thebes in order to study the monuments of that solemn city  of the dead; and during my long rides in the silent desert the germ was  developed whence this book has since grown. The leisure of mind and body  required to write it was given me through a long but not disabling illness.    In the first instance I intended to elucidate this story--like my  \"Egyptian Princess\"--with numerous and extensive notes placed at the  end; but I was led to give up this plan from finding that it would lead  me to the repetition of much that I had written in the notes to that  earlier work.    The numerous notes to the former novel had a threefold purpose. In the  first place they served to explain the text; in the second they were  a guarantee of the care with which I had striven to depict the  archaeological details in all their individuality from the records of  the monuments and of Classic Authors; and thirdly I hoped to supply the  reader who desired further knowledge of the period with some guide to  his studies.    In the present work I shall venture to content myself with the simple  statement that I have introduced nothing as proper to Egypt and to the  period of Rameses that cannot be proved by some authority; the numerous  monuments which have descended to us from the time of the Rameses,  in fact enable the enquirer to understand much of the aspect and  arrangement of Egyptian life, and to follow it step try step through  the details of religious, public, and private life, even of particular  individuals. The same remark cannot be made in regard to their mental  life, and here many an anachronism will slip in, many things will appear  modern, and show the coloring of the Christian mode of thought.    Every part of this book is intelligible without the aid of notes; but,  for the reader who seeks for further enlightenment, I have added some  foot-notes, and have not neglected to mention such works as afford more  detailed information on the subjects mentioned in the narrative.    The reader who wishes to follow the mind of the author in this work  should not trouble himself with the notes as he reads, but merely at  the beginning of each chapter read over the notes which belong to the  foregoing one. Every glance at the foot-notes must necessarily disturb  and injure the development of the tale as a work of art. The story  stands here as it flowed from one fount, and was supplied with notes  only after its completion.    A narrative of Herodotus combined with the Epos of Pentaur, of which  so many copies have been handed down to us, forms the foundation of the  story.    The treason of the Regent related by the Father of history is referable  perhaps to the reign of the third and not of the second Rameses. But it  is by no means certain that the Halicarnassian writer was in this case  misinformed; and in this fiction no history will be inculcated, only  as a background shall I offer a sketch of the time of Sesostris, from  a picturesque point of view, but with the nearest possible approach to  truth. It is true that to this end nothing has been neglected that could  be learnt from the monuments or the papyri; still the book is only a  romance, a poetic fiction, in which I wish all the facts derived from  history and all the costume drawn from the monuments to be regarded as  incidental, and the emotions of the actors in the story as what I attach  importance to.    But I must be allowed to make one observation. From studying the  conventional mode of execution of ancient Egyptian art--which was  strictly subject to the hieratic laws of type and proportion--we have  accustomed ourselves to imagine the inhabitants of the Nile-valley in  the time of the Pharaohs as tall and haggard men with little distinction  of individual physiognomy, and recently a great painter has sought to  represent them under this aspect in a modern picture. This is an error;  the Egyptians, in spite of their aversion to foreigners and their strong  attachment to their native soil, were one of the most intellectual and  active people of antiquity; and he who would represent them as they  lived, and to that end copies the forms which remain painted on the  walls of the temples and sepulchres, is the accomplice of those priestly  corrupters of art who compelled the painters and sculptors of the  Pharaonic era to abandon truth to nature in favor of their sacred laws  of proportion.    He who desires to paint the ancient Egyptians with truth and fidelity,  must regard it in some sort as an act of enfranchisement; that is to  say, he must release the conventional forms from those fetters which  were peculiar to their art and altogether foreign to their real life.  Indeed, works of sculpture remain to us of the time of the first  pyramid, which represent men with the truth of nature, unfettered by the  sacred canon. We can recall the so-called \"Village Judge\" of Bulaq, the  \"Scribe\" now in Paris, and a few figures in bronze in different museums,  as well as the noble and characteristic busts of all epochs, which amply  prove how great the variety of individual physiognomy, and, with that,  of individual character was among the Egyptians. Alma Tadelna in  London and Gustav Richter in Berlin have, as painters, treated Egyptian  subjects in a manner which the poet recognizes and accepts with delight.    Many earlier witnesses than the late writer Flavius Vopiscus might be  referred to who show us the Egyptians as an industrious and peaceful  people, passionately devoted it is true to all that pertains to the  other world, but also enjoying the gifts of life to the fullest extent,  nay sometimes to excess.    Real men, such as we see around us in actual life, not silhouettes  constructed to the old priestly scale such as the monuments show  us--real living men dwelt by the old Nile-stream; and the poet who would  represent them must courageously seize on types out of the daily life  of modern men that surround him, without fear of deviating too far from  reality, and, placing them in their own long past time, color them only  and clothe them to correspond with it.    I have discussed the authorities for the conception of love which I have  ascribed to the ancients in the preface to the second edition of \"An  Egyptian Princess.\"    With these lines I send Uarda into the world; and in them I add my  thanks to those dear friends in whose beautiful home, embowered in  green, bird-haunted woods, I have so often refreshed my spirit and  recovered my strength, where I now write the last words of this book.            Rheinbollerhutte, September 22, 1876.                           GEORG EBERS.          PREFACE TO THE FIFTH GERMAN EDITION.    The earlier editions of \"Uarda\" were published in such rapid succession,  that no extensive changes in the stereotyped text could be made; but  from the first issue, I have not ceased to correct it, and can now  present to the public this new fifth edition as a \"revised\" one.    Having felt a constantly increasing affection for \"Uarda\" during the  time I was writing, the friendly and comprehensive attention bestowed  upon it by our greatest critics and the favorable reception it met with  in the various classes of society, afforded me the utmost pleasure.    I owe the most sincere gratitude to the honored gentlemen, who called  my attention to certain errors, and among them will name particularly  Professor Paul Ascherson of Berlin, and Dr. C. Rohrbach of Gotha. Both  will find their remarks regarding mistakes in the geographical location  of plants, heeded in this new edition.    The notes, after mature deliberation, have been placed at the foot of  the pages instead of at the end of the book.    So many criticisms concerning the title \"Uarda\" have recently reached  my ears, that, rather by way of explanation than apology, I will here  repeat what I said in the preface to the third edition.    This title has its own history, and the more difficult it would be for  me to defend it, the more ready I am to allow an advocate to speak for  me, an advocate who bears a name no less distinguished than that of G.  E. Lessing, who says:    \"Nanine? (by Voltaire, 1749). What sort of title is that? What thoughts  does it awake? Neither more nor less than a title should arouse. A title  must not be a bill of fare. The less it betrays of the contents, the  better it is. Author and spectator are both satisfied, and the ancients  rarely gave their comedies anything but insignificant names.\"    This may be the case with \"Uarda,\" whose character is less prominent  than some others, it is true, but whose sorrows direct the destinies of  my other heroes and heroines.    Why should I conceal the fact? The character of \"Uarda\" and the present  story have grown out of the memory of a Fellah girl, half child, half  maiden, whom I saw suffer and die in a hut at Abu el Qurnah in the  Necropolis of Thebes.    I still persist in the conviction I have so frequently expressed, the  conviction that the fundamental traits of the life of the soul have  undergone very trivial modifications among civilized nations in all  times and ages, but will endeavor to explain the contrary opinion, held  by my opponents, by calling attention to the circumstance, that  the expression of these emotions show considerable variations among  different peoples, and "]]]
