BY GEORGE ALFRED TOWNSEND,    A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.          [Illustration: THE LIFE, CRIME, AND CAPTURE OF John Wilkes Booth AND THE  PURSUIT, TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF HIS ACCOMPLICES.]          EXPLANATORY.    One year ago the writer of the letters which follow, visited the Battle  Field of Waterloo. In looking over many relics of the combat preserved  in the Museum there, he was particularly interested in the files of  journals contemporary with the action. These contained the Duke of  Wellington's first despatch announcing the victory, the reports of the  subordinate commanders, and the current gossip as to the episodes and  hazards of the day.    The time will come when remarkable incidents of these our times will be  a staple of as great curiosity as the issue of Waterloo. It is an  incident without a precedent on this side of the globe, and never to be  repeated.    Assassination has made its last effort to become indigenous here. The  public sentiment of Loyalist and Rebel has denounced it: the world has  remarked it with uplifted hands and words of execration. Therefore, as  long as history shall hold good, the murder of the President will be a  theme for poesy, romance and tragedy. We who live in this consecrated  time keep the sacred souvenirs of Mr. Lincoln's death in our possession;  and the best of these are the news letters descriptive of his  apotheosis, and the fate of the conspirators who slew him.    I represented the _World_ newspaper at Washington during the whole of  those exciting weeks, and wrote their occurrences fresh from the mouths  of the actors. Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1865,    By DICK & FITZGERALD,    In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the  Southern District of New York.          PREFATORY.    It has seemed fitting to Messrs. DICK & FITZGERALD to reproduce the  _World_ letters, as a keepsake for the many who received them kindly.  The Sketches appended were conscientiously written, and whatever  embellishments they may seem to have grew out of the stirring  events,--not out of my fancy.    Subsequent investigation has confirmed the veracity even of their  speculations. I have arranged them, but have not altered them; if they  represent nothing else, they do carry with them the fever and spirit of  the time. But they do not assume to be literal history: We live too  close to the events related to decide positively upon them. As a  brochure of the day,--nothing more,--I give these Sketches of a  Correspondent to the public.    G. A. T.          THE LIFE, CRIME, AND CAPTURE    OF    JOHN WILKES BOOTH.          LETTER I.    THE MURDER.      Washington, April 17.    Some very deliberate and extraordinary movements were made by a handsome  and extremely well-dressed young man in the city of Washington last  Friday. At about half-past eleven o'clock A. M., this person, whose name  is J. Wilkes Booth, by profession an actor, and recently engaged in oil  speculations, sauntered into Ford's Theater, on Tenth, between E and F  streets, and exchanged greetings with the man at the box-office. In the  conversation which ensued, the ticket agent informed Booth that a box  was taken for Mr. Lincoln and General Grant, who were expected to visit  the theater, and contribute to the benefit of Miss Laura Keene, and  satisfy the curiosity of a large audience. Mr. Booth went away with a  jest, and a lightly-spoken \"Good afternoon.\" Strolling down to  Pumphreys' stable, on C street, in the rear of the National Hotel, he  engaged a saddle horse, a high-strung, fast, beautiful bay mare, telling  Mr. Pumphreys that he should call for her in the middle of the  afternoon.    From here he went to the Kirkwood Hotel, on the corner of Pennsylvania  avenue and Twelfth street, where, calling for a card and a sheet of  notepaper, he sat down and wrote upon the first as follows:    _For Mr. Andrew Johnson_:--    I don't wish to disturb you; are you at home?    J. W. Booth.    To this message, which was sent up by the obliging clerk, Mr. Johnson  responded that he was very busily engaged. Mr. Booth smiled, and turning  to his sheet of note-paper, wrote on it. The fact, if fact it is, that  he had been disappointed in not obtaining an examination of the  Vice-President's apartment and a knowledge of the Vice-President's  probable whereabouts the ensuing evening, in no way affected his  composure. The note, the contents of which are unknown, was signed and  sealed within a few moments. Booth arose, bowed to an acquaintance, and  passed into the street. His elegant person was seen on the avenue a few  minutes, and was withdrawn into the Metropolitan Hotel.    At 4 P. M., he again appeared at Pumphreys' livery stable, mounted the  mare he had engaged, rode leisurely up F street, turned into an alley  between Ninth And Tenth streets, and thence into an alley reloading to  the rear of Ford's Theater, which fronts on Tenth street, between E and  F streets. Here he alighted and deposited the mare in a small stable off  the alley, which he had hired sometime before for the accommodation of a  saddle-horse which he had recently sold. Mr. Booth soon afterward  retired from the stable, and is supposed to have refreshed himself at a  neighboring bar-room.    At 8 o'clock the same evening, President Lincoln and Speaker Colfax sat  together in a private room at the White House, pleasantly conversing.  General Grant, with whom the President had engaged to attend Ford's  Theater that evening, had left with his wife for Burlington, New-Jersey,  in the 6 o'clock train. After this departure Mr. Lincoln rather  reluctantly determined to keep his part of the engagement, rather than  to disappoint his friends and the audience. Mrs. Lincoln, entering the  room and turning to Mr. Colfax, said, in a half laughing, half serious  way, \"Well, Mr. Lincoln, are you going to the theater with me or not?\"  \"I suppose I shall have to go, Colfax,\" said the President, and the  Speaker took his leave in company with Major Rathbone, of the  Provost-Marshal General's office, who escorted Miss Harris, daughter of  Senator Harris, of New York. Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln reached Ford's Theater  at twenty minutes before 9 o'clock.    The house was filled in every part with a large and brilliantly attired  audience. As the presidential party ascended the stairs, and passed  behind the dress circle to the entrance of the private box reserved for  them, the whole assemblage, having in mind the recent Union victories,  arose, cheered, waving hats and handkerchiefs, and manifesting every  other accustomed sign of enthusiasm. The President, last to enter the  box, turned before doing so, and bowed a courteous acknowledgment of his  reception--At the moment of the President's arrival, Mr. Hawks, one of  the actors, performing the well-known part of Dundreary, had exclaimed:  \"This reminds me of a story, as Mr. Lincoln says.\" The audience forced  him, after the interruption, to tell the story over again. It evidently  pleased Mr. Lincoln, who turned laughingly to his wife and made a remark  which was not overheard.    [Illustration: Scene of the Assassination.    _X_ President's Position. _A_ The course of the Assassin after the  Murder. _BB_ Movable partition not in use on the night of the  Assassination. _D_ Door through which the Assassin looked in taking aim.  _C_ Closed door through which pistol ball was fired.]      The box in which the President sat consisted of two boxes turned into  one, the middle partition being removed, as on all occasions when a  state party visited the theater. The box was on a level with the dress  circle; about twelve feet above the stage. There were two entrances--the  door nearest to the wall having been closed and locked; the door nearest  the balustrades of the dress circle, and at right angles with it, being  open and left open, after the visitors had entered. The interior was  carpeted, lined with crimson paper, and furnished with a sofa covered  with crimson velvet, three arm chairs similarly covered, and six  cane-bottomed chairs. Festoons of flags hung before the front of the box  against a background of lace.    President Lincoln took one of the arm-chairs and seated himself in the  front of the box, in the angle nearest the audience, where, partially  screened from observation, he had the best view of what was transpiring  on the stage. Mrs. Lincoln sat next to him, and Miss Harris in the  opposite angle nearest the stage. Major Rathbone sat just behind Mrs.  Lincoln and Miss Harris. These four were the only persons in the box.    The play proceeded, although \"Our American Cousin,\" without Mr. Sothern,  has, since that gentleman's departure from this country, been justly  esteemed a very dull affair. The audience at Ford's, including Mrs.  Lincoln, seemed to enjoy it very much. The worthy wife of the President  leaned forward, her hand upon her husband's knee, watching every scene  in the drama with amused attention. Even across the President's face at  intervals swept a smile, robbing it of its habitual sadness.    About the beginning of the second act, the mare, standing in the stable  in the rear of the theater, was disturbed in the midst of her meal by  the entrance of the young man who had quitted her in the afternoon. It  is presumed that she was saddled and bridled with exquisite care.    Having completed these preparations, Mr. Booth entered the theater by  the stage door; summoned one of the scene shifters, Mr. John Spangler,  emerged through the same door with that individual, leaving the door  open, and left the mare in his hands to be held until he (Booth) should  return. Booth who was even more fashionably "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#1)"],[1,"of the Sky    by Garrett Serviss    Curiosities of the Sky was first published in 1909 and the text is in  the public domain.

It is not the mathematics  of astronomy, but the wonder and the mystery that seize upon the  imagination. The calculation of an eclipse owes all its prestige to  the sublimity of its data; the operation, in itself, requires no more  mental effort than the preparation of a railway time-table.    The dominion which astronomy has always held over the minds of men is  akin to that of poetry; when the former becomes merely instructive and  the latter purely didactic, both lose their power over the  imagination. Astronomy is known as the oldest of the sciences, and it  will be the longest-lived because it will always have arcana that have  not been penetrated.    Some of the things described in this book are little known to the  average reader, while others are well known; but all possess the  fascination of whatever is strange, marvelous, obscure, or mysterious  -- magnified, in this case, by the portentous scale of the phenomena.    The idea of the author is to tell about these things in plain  language, but with as much scientific accuracy as plain language will  permit, showing the wonder that is in them without getting away from  the facts. Most of them have hitherto been discussed only in technical  form, and in treatises that the general public seldom sees and never  reads.    Among the topics touched upon are:    * The strange unfixedness of the ``fixed stars,'' the vast      migrations of the suns and worlds constituting the universe.    * The slow passing out of existence of those collocations of stars      which for thousands of years have formed famous      ``constellations,'' preserving the memory of mythological heroes      and heroines, and perhaps of otherwise unrecorded history.    * The tendency of stars to assemble in immense clouds, swarms, and      clusters.    * The existence in some of the richest regions of the universe of      absolutely black, starless gaps, deeps, or holes, as if one were      looking out of a window into the murkiest night.    * The marvelous phenomena of new, or temporary, stars, which appear      as suddenly as conflagrations, and often turn into something else      as eccentric as themselves.    * The amazing forms of the ``whirlpool,'' ``spiral,'' ``pinwheel,''      and ``lace,'' or ``tress,'' nebulae.    * The strange surroundings of the sun, only seen in particular      circumstances, but evidently playing a constant part in the daily      phenomena of the solar system.    * The mystery of the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein.    * The extraordinary transformations undergone by comets and their      tails.    * The prodigies of meteorites and masses of stone and metal fallen      from the sky.    * The cataclysms that have wrecked the moon.    * The problem of life and intelligence on the planet Mars.    * The problematical origin and fate of the asteroids.    * The strange phenomena of the auroral lights.    An attempt has been made to develop these topics in an orderly way,  showing their connection, so that the reader may obtain a broad  general view of the chief mysteries and problems of astronomy, and an  idea of the immense field of discovery which still lies, almost  unexplored, before it.    The Windows of Absolute Night    To most minds mystery is more fascinating than science. But when  science itself leads straight up to the borders of mystery and there  comes to a dead stop, saying, ``At present I can no longer see my  way,'' the force of the charm is redoubled. On the other hand, the  illimitable is no less potent in mystery than the invisible, whence  the dramatic effect of Keats' ``stout Cortez'' staring at the  boundless Pacific while all his men look at each other with a wild  surmise, ``silent upon a peak in Darien.'' It is with similar feelings  that the astronomer regards certain places where from the peaks of the  universe his vision seems to range out into endless empty space. He  sees there the shore of his little isthmus, and, beyond, unexplored  immensity.    The name, ``coal-sacks,'' given to these strange voids is hardly  descriptive. Rather they produce upon the mind the effect of blank  windows in a lonely house on a pitch-dark night, which, when looked at  from the brilliant interior, become appalling in their rayless murk.  Infinity seems to acquire a new meaning in the presence of these black  openings in the sky, for as one continues to gaze it loses its purely  metaphysical quality and becomes a kind of entity, like the ocean. The  observer is conscious that he can actually see the beginning of its  ebon depths, in which the visible universe appears to float like an  enchanted island, resplendent within with lights and life and gorgeous  spectacles, and encircled with screens of crowded stars, but with its  dazzling vistas ending at the fathomless sea of pure darkness which  encloses all.    The Galaxy, or Milky Way, surrounds the borders of our island in space  like a stellar garland, and when openings appear in it they are, by  contrast, far more impressive than the general darkness of the  interstellar expanse seen in other directions. Yet even that expanse  is not everywhere equally dark, for it contains gloomy deeps  discernable with careful watching. Here, too, contrast plays an  important part, though less striking than within the galactic region.  Some of Sir William Herschel's observations appear to indicate an  association between these tenebrious spots and neighboring star clouds  and nebulae. It is an illuminating bit of astronomical history that  when he was sweeping the then virgin heavens with his great telescopes  he was accustomed to say to his sister who, note-book in hand, waited  at his side to take down his words, fresh with the inspiration of  discovery: ``Prepare to write; the nebulae are coming; here space is  vacant.''    The most famous of the ``coal-sacks,'' and the first to be brought to  general attention before astronomers had awakened to the significance  of such things, lies adjacent to the ``Southern Cross,'' and is truly  an amazing phenomenon. It is not alone the conspicuousness of this  celestial vacancy, opening suddenly in the midst of one of the richest  parts of the Galaxy, that has given it its fame, but quite as much the  superstitious awe with which it was regarded by the early explorers of  the South Seas. To them, as well as to those who listened in rapt  wonder to their tales, the ``Coal-sack'' seemed to possess some occult  connection with the mystic ``Cross.'' In the eyes of the sailors it  was not a vacancy so much as a sable reality in the sky, and as,  shuddering, they stared at it, they piously crossed themselves. It was  another of the magical wonders of the unknown South, and as such it  formed the basis of many a ``wild surmise'' and many a sea-dog's yarn.  Scientific investigation has not diminished its prestige, and today no  traveler in the southern hemisphere is indifferent to its fascinating  strangeness, while some find it the most impressive spectacle of the  antarctic heavens.    All around, up to the very edge of the yawning gap, the sheen of the  Milky Way is surpassingly glorious; but there, as if in obedience to  an almighty edict, everything vanishes. A single faint star is visible  within the opening, producing a curious effect upon the sensitive  spectator, like the sight of a tiny islet in the midst of a black,  motionless, waveless tarn. The dimensions of the lagoon of darkness,  which is oval or pear-shaped, are eight degrees by five, so that it  occupies a space in the sky about one hundred and thirty times greater  than the area of the full moon. It attracts attention as soon as the  eye is directed toward the quarter where it exists, and by virtue of  the rarity of such phenomena it appears a far greater wonder than the  drifts of stars that are heaped around it. Now that observatories are  multiplying in the southern hemisphere, the great austral  ``Coal-sack'' will, no doubt, receive attention proportioned to its  importance as one of the most significant features of the sky. Already  at the Sydney Observatory photographs have shown that the southern  portion of this Dead Sea of Space is not quite ``bottomless,''  although its northern part defies the longest sounding lines of the  astronomer.    There is a similar, but less perfect, ``coal-sack'' in the northern  hemisphere, in the constellation of ``The Swan,'' which, strange to  say, also contains a well-marked figure of a cross outlined by stars.  This gap lies near the top of the cross-shaped figure. It is best seen  by averted vision, which brings out the contrast with the Milky Way,  which is quite brilliant around it. It does not, however, exercise the  same weird attraction upon the eye as the southern ``Coal-sack,'' for  instead of looking like an absolute void in the sky, it rather appears  as if a canopy of dark gauze had been drawn over the stars. We shall  see the possible significance of this appearance later.    Just above the southern horizon of our northern middle latitudes, in  summer, where the Milky Way breaks up into vast sheets of nebulous  luminosity, lying over and between the constellations Scorpio and  Sagittarius, there is a remarkable assemblage of ``coal-sacks,''  though none is of great size. One of them, near a conspicuous  star-cluster in Scorpio, M80, is interesting"]]]
