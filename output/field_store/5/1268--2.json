THE MORMON DOCTRINE OF DEITY    THE ROBERTS-VAN DER DONCKT DISCUSSION    TO WHICH IS ADDED A DISCOURSE    JESUS CHRIST: THE REVELATION OF GOD    BY B. H. ROBERTS.    ALSO A COLLECTION OF AUTHORITATIVE MORMON UTTERANCES ON THE BEING AND  NATURE OF GOD.    \"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the  character of God; and to know that we may converse with him as one man  converses with another.\"--Joseph Smith.    \"He who possesses a knowledge of God, and a knowledge of man, will not  easily commit sin.\"--Talmud.    Salt Lake City, Utah.    1903.        PREFACE.    In nothing have men so far departed from revealed truth as in their  conceptions of God. Therefore, when it pleased the Lord in these last  days to open again direct communication with men, by a new dispensation  of the gospel, it is not surprising that the very first revelation  given was one that revealed himself and his Son Jesus Christ. A  revelation which not only made known the _being_ of God, but the _kind_  of a being he is. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in his account of his first  great revelation, declares that he saw \"two personages,\" resembling  each other in form and features, but whose brightness and glory defied  all description. One of these personages addressed the prophet and  said, as he pointed to the other--    \"_This is my beloved Son, hear him_.\"    This was the revelation with which the work of God in the last days  began. The revelation of God, the Father; and of God, the Son. They  were seen to be two distinct personages. They were like men in form;  but infinitely more glorious in appearance, because perfect and divine.  The Old Testament truth was reaffirmed by this revelation--\"God created  man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.\" Also the  truth of the New Testament was reaffirmed--Jesus Christ was shown to be  the express image of the Father's person, hence God, the Father, was in  form like the Man, Christ Jesus, who is also called \"the Son of Man.\"    Again the Old Testament truth was revealed--\"The _Gods_ said let _us_  make man in _our_ image, and in _our_ likeness.\" That is, more than  _one_ God was engaged in the work of creation. Also the truth of the  New Testament was again reaffirmed--the Father and the Son are seen to  be two separate and distinct persons or individuals; hence the Godhead  is plural, a council, consisting of three distinct persons, as shown at  the baptism of Jesus, and throughout the conversations and discourses  of Jesus and his inspired apostles.    All this, coming so sharply in conflict with the ideas of an apostate  Christendom which had rejected the plain anthropomorphism of the Old  and New Testament revelations of God; also the scriptural doctrine of a  plurality of Gods, for a false philosophy-created God, immaterial and  passionless--all this, I say, could not fail to provoke controversy;  for the revelation given to Joseph Smith challenged the truth of the  conception of God held by the modern world-pagan, Jew, Mohammedan and  Christian alike.    It was not to be expected, then, that controversy could be avoided,  though it has been the policy of the Elders of the Church to avoid  debate as far as possible--debate which so often means contention,  a mere bandying of words--and have trusted in the reaffirmation of  the old truths of revelation, accompanied by a humble testimony of  their divinity, to spread abroad a knowledge of the true God. Still,  controversy, I repeat could not always be avoided. From the beginning,  \"Mormon\" views of Deity have been assailed. They have been denounced as  \"awful blasphemy;\" \"soul destroying;\" \"the lowest kind of materialism;\"  \"destructive of all truly religious sentiment;\" \"the worst form of  pantheism;\" \"the crudest possible conception of God;\" \"absolutely  incompatible with spirituality;\" \"worse than the basest forms of  idolatry.\" These are a few of the phrases in which \"Mormon\" views of  Deity have been described. Defense against these attacks has been  rendered necessary from time to time; and whenever Elders of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have entered into discussions on  the subject of Deity, they have not failed to make it clear that the  scriptures sustained their doctrine, although they may not always have  been successful in stopping the denunciations, sarcasm, and ridicule of  their opponents. This, however, is matter of small moment, since making  clear the truth is the object of discussion, not superior strength in  denunciation, bitterness in invective, keenness in sarcasm, or subtilty  in ridicule.    In the winter and summer of 1901, unusual interest was awakened in  \"Mormon\" views of Deity, in consequence of a series of lectures on  the subject delivered by a prominent sectarian minister of Salt Lake  City, and other discourses delivered before sectarian conventions of  one kind or another held during the summer months of the year named.  Now it so happened that for that same year the General Board of the  Young Men's Improvement Associations of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints had planned a course of theological study involving  consideration of this same subject--the being and nature of God;  therefore, when the Mutual Improvement Associations of the Salt Lake  Stake of Zion met in conference on the 18th of August of that year, and  the writer was invited to deliver an address at one of the sessions  of the conference, the time to him seemed opportune to set forth as  clearly as might be the doctrine of the Church of Christ as to God.  Accordingly the discourse, which makes chapter one in this book, was  delivered. The discourse attracted some considerable attention, being  published both in the _Deseret News_ and _Improvement Era_: in the  latter publication, in revised form. Through a copy of this magazine  the discourse fell into the hands of the Reverend C. Van Der Donckt, of  Pocatello, Idaho, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church; and he wrote a  Reply to it, which by the courtesy of the editors of the _Improvement  Era_ was published in that magazine, and now appears as chapter two in  this work.    It was very generally conceded that Rev. Van Der Donckt's Reply was  an able paper--a view in which I most heartily concur; and it had  the additional merit of being free from offensive personalities or  any indulgence in ridicule or sarcasms of those principles which the  gentleman sought to controvert. Some were of opinion that the Rev.  gentleman's argument could not be successfully answered. This was  a view in which I did not concur; for however unequal my skill in  debate might be as compared with that of the Rev. gentleman of the  Catholic Church, I had, and have now, supreme confidence in the truth  of the doctrines I believe and advocate; and I was sure this advantage  of having the truth would more than outweigh any want of skill in  controversy on my part. In this confidence the Rejoinder was written  and published in the _Improvement Era_, and now appears as chapter  three in this work. How successfully the Rejoinder meets the criticism  upon our doctrines by the Rev. gentleman who wrote the Reply, will, of  course, be determined by the individual reader.    The discourse with which this controversy begins appears in chapter  one as it did in the _Era_; unchanged except by the enlargement of  a quotation or two from Dr. Draper's works, and Sir Robert Ball's  writings, and the addition of one or two notes, with here and there  a mere verbal change which in no way affects the thought or argument  of the discourse, as I recognize the fact that any alteration which  would change the argument or introduce new matter in the discourse,  would be unfair to Mr. Van Der Donckt. The Rev. gentleman's Reply is,  of course, exactly as it appeared in the _Improvement Era_ for August  and September, 1902. In the Rejoinder I have felt more at liberty, and  therefore have made some few changes in the arrangement of paragraphs,  and have here and there strengthened the argument, though even in this  division of the discussion the changes in the _Era_ copy are but slight.    In chapter four I publish another discourse--_Jesus Christ: the  Revelation of God_, which I trust will emphasize and render even more  clear than my first discourse the belief of the Church that Jesus  Christ is the complete and perfect revelation of God;--that such as  Jesus Christ is, God is.    In chapters five, six, seven and eight is a collection of utterances  from our sacred scriptures, and from some of the prophets in the  Church, on the doctrine of Deity, which I may say without reserve will  be found extremely valuable to the student of this great subject;  and these passages are so arranged as to make clear the fact that  our doctrines on the subject of Deity are today what they have been  from the commencement; and while there may have been an unfolding of  the doctrines, an enlargement of our understanding of them, there is  nothing in our doctrines on Deity today but what was germinally present  in that first great revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith, in  which God made himself known once more to a prophet, who knew him, as  Moses did, face to face--as a man knows his friend.
