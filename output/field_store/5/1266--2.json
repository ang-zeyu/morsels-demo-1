D., F.R.S.,    PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF GIESSEN.      EDITED BY    JOHN GARDNER, M.D.,      MEMBER OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY.        Second Edition, Corrected.    LONDON:    MDCCCXLIV.              PREFACE      The Letters contained in this little Volume embrace some of the most  important points of the science of Chemistry, in their application  to Natural Philosophy, Physiology, Agriculture, and Commerce. Some  of them treat of subjects which have already been, or will hereafter  be, more fully discussed in my larger works. They were intended to  be mere sketches, and were written for the especial purpose of  exciting the attention of governments, and an enlightened public, to  the necessity of establishing Schools of Chemistry, and of  promoting, by every means, the study of a science so intimately  connected with the arts, pursuits, and social well-being of modern  civilised nations.    For my own part I do not scruple to avow the conviction, that ere  long, a knowledge of the principal truths of Chemistry will be  expected in every educated man, and that it will be as necessary to  the Statesman, the Political Economist, and the Practical  Agriculturist, as it is already indispensable to the Physician, and  the Manufacturer.    In Germany, such of these Letters as have been already published,  have not failed to produce some of the results anticipated. New  professorships have been established in the Universities of  Goettingen and Wuertzburg, for the express purpose of facilitating  the application of chemical truths to the practical arts of life,  and of following up the new line of investigation and research--the  bearing of Chemistry upon Physiology, Medicine, and Agriculture,--which  may be said to be only just begun.    My friend, Dr. Ernest Dieffenbach, one of my first pupils, who is  well acquainted with all the branches of Chemistry, Physics, Natural  History, and Medicine, suggested to me that a collection of these  Letters would be acceptable to the English public, which has so  favourably received my former works.    I readily acquiesced in the publication of an English edition, and  undertook to write a few additional Letters, which should embrace  some conclusions I have arrived at, in my recent investigations, in  connection with the application of chemical science to the  physiology of plants and agriculture.    My esteemed friend, Dr. Gardner, has had the kindness to revise the  manuscript and the proof sheets for publication, for which I cannot  refrain expressing my best thanks.    It only remains for me to add a hope, that this little offering may  serve to make new friends to our beautiful and useful science, and  be a remembrancer to those old friends who have, for many years  past, taken a lively interest in all my labours.

LETTERS ON CHEMISTRY          LETTER I      My dear Sir,    The influence which the science of chemistry exercises upon human  industry, agriculture, and commerce; upon physiology, medicine, and  other sciences, is now so interesting a topic of conversation  everywhere, that it may be no unacceptable present to you if I trace  in a few familiar letters some of the relations it bears to these  various sciences, and exhibit for you its actual effect upon the  present social condition of mankind.    In speaking of the present state of chemistry, its rise and  progress, I shall need no apology if, as a preliminary step, I call  your attention to the implements which the chemist employs--the  means which are indispensable to his labours and to his success.    These consist, generally, of materials furnished to us by nature,  endowed with many most remarkable properties fitting them for our  purposes; if one of them is a production of art, yet its adaptation  to the use of mankind,--the qualities which render it available to  us,--must be referred to the same source as those derived  immediately from nature.    Cork, Platinum, Glass, and Caoutchouc, are the substances to which I  allude, and which minister so essentially to modern chemical  investigations. Without them, indeed, we might have made some  progress, but it would have been slow; we might have accomplished  much, but it would have been far less than has been done with their  aid. Some persons, by the employment of expensive substances, might  have successfully pursued the science; but incalculably fewer minds  would have been engaged in its advancement. These materials have  only been duly appreciated and fully adopted within a very recent  period. In the time of Lavoisier, the rich alone could make chemical  researches; the necessary apparatus could only be procured at a very  great expense.    And first, of Glass: every one is familiar with most of the  properties of this curious substance; its transparency, hardness,  destitution of colour, and stability under ordinary circumstances:  to these obvious qualities we may add those which especially adapt  it to the use of the chemist, namely, that it is unaffected by most  acids or other fluids contained within it. At certain temperatures  it becomes more ductile and plastic than wax, and may be made to  assume in our hands, before the flame of a common lamp, the form of  every vessel we need to contain our materials, and of every  apparatus required to pursue our experiments.    Then, how admirable and valuable are the properties of Cork! How  little do men reflect upon the inestimable worth of so common a  substance! How few rightly esteem the importance of it to the  progress of science, and the moral advancement of mankind!--There is  no production of nature or art equally adapted to the purposes to  which the chemist applies it. Cork consists of a soft, highly  elastic substance, as a basis, having diffused throughout a matter  with properties resembling wax, tallow, and resin, yet dissimilar to  all of these, and termed suberin. This renders it perfectly  impermeable to fluids, and, in a great measure, even to gases. It is  thus the fittest material we possess for closing our bottles, and  retaining"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#1)"],[1,"http://mormontextsproject.org/ for a complete list of  Mormon texts available on Project Gutenberg, to help  proofread similar books, or to report typos.              THE LIFE OF JOHN TAYLOR,    THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    BY B. H. ROBERTS.        The great man is he who chooses the right with invincible      resolution.    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH: 1892.    To the family of the late President John Taylor this work is  respectfully dedicated, with the hope that it will inspire in the minds  of his numerous and ever-increasing posterity an emulation of his  virtues.        Preface.    If the preface to a book be looked upon as the author's excuse for  writing it, then this book should have no preface, for the author has  no excuse to make. Justice to the character and labors of John Taylor  demanded that his life be written. The annals of the Church could not  be recorded without devoting large space to the part he took in her  affairs; but no notice of his life and labors, however extended in a  general history, could do justice to his great career: for of course  there is much in that career peculiar to himself, and of a character,  too, to make it worthy of a separate volume.    The author is of the opinion that John Taylor would have had a  remarkable history even if Mormonism had not found him; for he  possessed those qualities of mind which would have made him a leader  and a reformer among men. It is quite probable, too, that in the event  of Mormonism not finding him, he would have won more of the honors and  applause of men; for while his connection with the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints threw him into prominence, the disrepute  in which that Church is held brought reproach and odium upon him from  the world. Had the courage and unselfish devotion which he brought to  the support of Mormonism been given to some reform movement less odious  in the estimation of mankind, his conduct would have called forth the  highest encomiums from all men; but as those virtues were displayed for  the interest and advancement of Mormonism, the world either refused to  recognize them at all, or accounted them fanaticism merely, for which  no praise was due.    The praise of the world, however, is a small matter. It often praises  those least worthy; it neglects or abuses those who are its chief  benefactors. Our generation like many that have preceded it, garnishes  the sepulchres of the ancient prophets, saying, \"Had we lived in their  day, we would not have persecuted and killed them.\" And yet with  strange inconsistency they hunt to the death the living prophets whose  memory future generations will honor. But the praise or censure of the  world had little influence over the mind of John Taylor where truth  was concerned. The more men despised it the more intense seemed his  devotion.    In that most beautiful of all his poems entitled \"An Irishman's Address  to his Mistress\"--the poem is an allegory, the mistress is the Irish  Catholic Church--Thomas Moore represents the Irishman as saying that  through grief and through danger the smile of his mistress had cheered  his way, till hope seemed to spring from thorns that round him lay; the  darker their fortunes, the brighter their pure love burned, until shame  into glory and fear into zeal was turned. The mistress had a rival.  That rival was honored, while the mistress was wronged and scorned; her  crown was of briars, while gold the rival's brows adorned. The rival  wooed him to temples, while the mistress lay hid in caves; the former's  friends were all masters, while the latter's, alas! were all slaves.  \"Yet,\" said the faithful devotee, \"cold in the earth at thy feet I  would rather be, than wed what I love not, or turn one thought from  thee!\" Such was the love of John Taylor for the Church of Christ to  which he devoted his life.    The author has but one reason to give for undertaking the pleasing  task of writing this book--he loved the subject. To him John Taylor  was the embodiment of those qualities of mind and heart which most  become a man. He therefore applied to the family of the late President  John Taylor--they being the parties most interested in such an  undertaking--for the privilege of writing his history. They gave a  ready assent, and the work was begun. Of the difficulties attending the  production of this history I need not speak. They are such as attend  all similar undertakings. The journals of President Taylor were very  incomplete, covering only fragments of his life at best; but the chief  events of his life were so closely interwoven with the history of the  Church that his movements and labors could be followed in the Church  publications; so that I feel reasonably certain that no important fact  is omitted.    To George J. Taylor--the eldest son of President Taylor--I am indebted  for many valuable items of information; and he has taken an abiding  interest in the work from its commencement.    At my request the first Presidency of the Church appointed a committee  to read the manuscript and pass upon it critically in respect to its  doctrinal and historical correctness. That committee was Elders John  Jaques and L. John Nuttall, the former assistant Church historian,  the latter for a number of years secretary to President Taylor. The  position these brethren occupied made them intimately acquainted with  the subject, and they were enabled to render me valuable assistance in  my work, for which I am deeply grateful to them.    The work is now presented to the public in the hope that it will meet  with approval, and preserve to the present and future generations a  true history of John Taylor, the third President of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints.
