Clemens)                               Part 2.        CHAPTER VII    MERLIN'S TOWER    Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far  as political power and authority were concerned, much was made  of me.  My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,  and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  But habit  would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.  I was  given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after  the king's.  They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,  but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,  and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.  As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any.  I mean  _little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make  the real comfort of life.  The big oaken chairs, graced with rude  carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.  There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal  one, about as powerful as a pail of water.  And not a chromo.  I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without  my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric  of my being, and was become a part of me.  It made me homesick  to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness  and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending  as it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an  insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home  over the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  But here, even in  my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of  a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either  woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it  was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,  even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably,  after all his practice on those nightmares they call his \"celebrated  Hampton Court cartoons.\"  Raphael was a bird.  We had several  of his chromos; one was his \"Miraculous Draught of Fishes,\" where  he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which  wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting.  I always admired  to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.    There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  I had  a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the  anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.  There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full  of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was  the thing that produced what was regarded as light.  A lot of  these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it  down enough to make it dismal.  If you went out at night, your  servants carried torches.  There were no books, pens, paper or  ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.  It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes  a big thing.  But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't  any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  I saw that I was just another  Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society  but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life  bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize  things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  Well,  that was in my line.    One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which  people took in me.  Apparently the whole nation wanted a look  at me.  It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British  world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,  from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and  the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying  and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was  come.  Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful  event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he  could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going  to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved  his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man  who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and  its peoples from extinction.  Now if you consider that everybody  believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed  of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not  a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles  to get a sight of me.  Of course I was all the talk--all other  subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of  minor interest and notoriety.  Within twenty-four hours the  delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight  they kept coming.  The village was crowded, and all the countryside.  I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these  reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  It came to be a great burden,  as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time  compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center  of homage.  It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which  was a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn't  understand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  I spoke to Clarence  about it.  By George!  I had to explain to him what it was.  Then  he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen  priests.  Land! think of that.    There was another thing that troubled me a little.  Those multitudes  presently began to agitate for another miracle.  That was natural.  To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they  had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,  and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,  and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen  him work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distance  to see _them_.  The pressure got to be pretty strong.  There was  going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour,  but it was too far away.  Two years.  I would have given a good  deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was  a big market for it.  It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,  and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn't have any  use for it, as like as not.  If it had been booked for only a month  away, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn't  seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up  trying.  Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself  busy on the sly among those people.  He was spreading a report that  I was a humbug, and that the reason I didn't accommodate the people  with a miracle was because I couldn't.  I saw that I must do  something.  I presently thought out a plan.    By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same  cell I had occupied myself.  Then I gave public notice by herald  and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for  a fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment's  leisure and blow up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven;  in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him  beware.  Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at  this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,  I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.  Quiet ensued.    I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we  went to work privately.  I told him that this was a sort of miracle  that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden  death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  That made  his mouth safe enough.  Clandestinely we made a few bushels of  first-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while  they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  This old stone  tower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman,  and four hundred years old.  Yes, and handsome, after a rude  fashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt  of scale mail.  It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from  the castle, and about half a mile away.    Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stones  out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,  which were fifteen feet thick at the base.  We put in a peck  at a time, in a dozen places.  We could have blown up the Tower  of London with these charges.  When the thirteenth night was come  we put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of  powder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  Everybody  had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but  on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people,  through the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.  Then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four  hours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief  notice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by  torch-baskets in the same places if at night.    Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was  not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn't have cared for  a delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy  with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.    Of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without  a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  I kept secluded,  and watched the weather.  Clarence dropped in from time to time  and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the  time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far  as one could see from the battlements.  At last the wind sprang up  and a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7244"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 3.

Clemens)                               Part 3.          CHAPTER XII    SLOW TORTURE    Straight off, we were in the country.  It was most lovely and  pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning  in the first freshness of autumn.  From hilltops we saw fair  green valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding through  them, and island groves of trees here and there, and huge lonely  oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade; and beyond  the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretching  away in billowy perspective to the horizon, with at wide intervals  a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which we knew was  a castle.  We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew,  and we moved like spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no sound  of footfall; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green  light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves  overhead, and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets  went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of  whispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left the  world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich  gloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and scurried  by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place  where the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turning  out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder  and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on  a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of  the woods.  And by and by out we would swing again into the glare.    About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into  the glare--it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so  after sun-up--it wasn't as pleasant as it had been.  It was  beginning to get hot.  This was quite noticeable.  We had a very  long pull, after that, without any shade.  Now it is curious how  progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get  a start.  Things which I didn't mind at all, at first, I began  to mind now--and more and more, too, all the time.  The first  ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn't seem to care;  I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any matter, and dropped  it out of my mind.  But now it was different; I wanted it all  the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; I couldn't  get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and said  hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets  in it.  You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other  things; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can't take off  by yourself.  That hadn't occurred to me when I put it there;  and in fact I didn't know it.  I supposed it would be particularly  convenient there.  And so now, the thought of its being there,  so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the  worse and the harder to bear.  Yes, the thing that you can't get  is the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that.  Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off,  and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed,  imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and it  was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling  down into my eyes, and I couldn't get at it.  It seems like a little  thing, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; it was  the most real kind of misery.  I would not say it if it was not so.  I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time,  let it look how it might, and people say what they would.  Of course  these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous,  and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort  first, and style afterwards.  So we jogged along, and now and then  we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds and  get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I said  things I oughtn't to have said, I don't deny that.  I am not  better than others.    We couldn't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain, not  even an ogre; and, in the mood I was in then, it was well for  the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.  Most knights  would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so I got  his bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all of me.    Meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.  You see,  the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more  all the time.  Well, when you are hot, that way, every little thing  irritates you.  When I trotted, I rattled like a crate of dishes,  and that annoyed me; and moreover I couldn't seem to stand that  shield slatting and banging, now about my breast, now around my  back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched  in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn't  create any breeze at that gait, I was like to get fried in that  stove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the iron  settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh  every minute.  And you had to be always changing hands, and passing  your spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one hand  to hold it long at a time.    Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes  a time when you--when you--well, when you itch.  You are inside,  your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between.  It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may.  First it is one  place; then another; then some more; and it goes on spreading and  spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody  can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is.  And  when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I could  not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and settled  on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn't work, and I  couldn't get the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which  was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a fly  acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough  to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz  all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way  that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not  stand.  So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and  relieve me of it.  Then she emptied the conveniences out of it  and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and  she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how  refreshing it was.  She continued to fetch and pour until I was  well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.    It was good to have a rest--and peace.  But nothing is quite  perfect in this life, at any time.  I had made a pipe a while back,  and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what  some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried.  These comforts had been in the helmet, and now I had them again,  but no matches.    Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in  upon my understanding--that we were weather-bound.  An armed novice  cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.  Sandy was  not enough; not enough for me, anyway.  We had to wait until  somebody should come along.  Waiting, in silence, would have been  agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for reflection, and  wanted to give it a chance to work.  I wanted to try and think out  how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever  have learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and  how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations  when it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had  to suffer all the days of their lives.  I wanted to think that out;  and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil  and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but  thinking was out of the question in the circumstances.  You couldn't  think, where Sandy was.    She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had  a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill, and made your head  sore like the drays and wagons in a city.  If she had had a cork  she would have been a comfort.  But you can't cork that kind;  they would die.  Her clack was going all day, and you would think  something would surely happen to her works, by and by; but no,  they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for  words.  She could grind, and pump, and churn, and buzz by the week,  and never stop to oil up or blow out.  And yet the result was just  nothing but wind.  She never had any ideas, any more than a fog  has.  She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw,  talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber; but just as good as she  could be.  I hadn't minded her mill that morning, on account of  having that hornets' nest of other troubles; but more than once  in the afternoon I had to say:    \"Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air,  the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow, and it's  a low enough treasury without that.\"        CHAPTER XIII    FREEMEN    Yes, it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be  contented.  Only a little while back, when I was riding and  suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity  in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have  seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time  by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet  already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not  light my pipe--for, although I had long ago started a match factory,  I had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly"]]]
