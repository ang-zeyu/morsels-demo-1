FIFTY FAMOUS PEOPLE    A BOOK OF SHORT STORIES    BY JAMES BALDWIN            PREFATORY NOTE        One of the best things to be said of the stories in this volume is  that, although they are not biographical, they are about real persons  who actually lived and performed their parts in the great drama of the  world's history. Some of these persons were more famous than others,  yet all have left enduring \"footprints on the sands of time\" and their  names will not cease to be remembered. In each of the stories there  is a basis of truth and an ethical lesson which cannot fail to have  a wholesome influence; and each possesses elements of interest which,  it is believed, will go far towards proving the fallibility of the  doctrine that children find delight only in tales of the imaginative  and unreal. The fact that there are a few more than fifty famous people  mentioned in the volume may be credited to the author's wish to give  good measure.

THE GOLDEN TRIPOD          SAVING THE BIRDS        One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country  road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to  attend court.    There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping  from the trees, and the grass was wet.    The four lawyers rode along, one behind another; for the pathway was  narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and  talked and laughed and were very jolly.    As they were passing through a grove of small trees, they heard a great  fluttering over their heads and a feeble chirping in the grass by the  roadside.    \"Stith! stith! stith!\" came from the leafy branches above them.    \"Cheep! cheep! cheep!\" came from the wet grass.    \"What is the matter here?\" asked the first lawyer, whose name was  Speed. \"Oh, it's only some old robins!\" said the second lawyer, whose  name was Hardin. \"The storm has blown two of the little ones out of  the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is making a  great fuss about it.\"    \"What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,\" said the third  lawyer, whose name I forget.    \"Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Why should  we bother?\"    \"Yes, why should we?\" said Mr. Speed.    The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds  fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying  about, and crying to her mate.    Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes  they had forgotten about the birds.    But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got  down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big  warm hands.    They did not seem frightened, but chirped softly, as if they knew they  were safe.    \"Never mind, my little fellows,\" said Mr. Lincoln \"I will put you in  your own cozy little bed.\"    [Illustration]    Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was  high, much higher than he could reach.    But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was  a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little  home. Two other baby birds were there, that had not fallen out. All  cuddled down together and were very happy.    Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to  give their horses water.    \"Where is Lincoln?\" asked one.    All were surprised to find that he was not with them.    \"Do you remember those birds?\" said Mr. Speed. \"Very likely he has  stopped to take care of them.\"    In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with  mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree.    \"Hello, Abraham!\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Where have you been?\"    \"I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother,\" he answered.    \"Well, we always thought you were a hero,\" said Mr. Speed. \"Now we  know it.\"    Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish  that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless  young birds.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"I could not have slept to-night, if  I had left those helpless little robins to perish in the wet grass.\"    Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and  statesman. He was elected president. Next to Washington he was the  greatest American.        ANOTHER BIRD STORY        A great battle had begun. Cannon were booming, some far away, some  near at hand. Soldiers were marching through the fields. Men on  horseback were riding in haste toward the front.    \"Whiz!\" A cannon ball struck the ground quite near to a company of  soldiers. But they marched straight onward. The drums were beating,  the fifes were playing.    \"Whiz!\" Another cannon ball flew through the air and struck a tree  near by. A brave general was riding across the field. One ball after  another came whizzing near him.    \"General, you are in danger here,\" said an officer who was riding with  him. \"You had better fall back to a place of safety.\"    [Illustration]    But the general rode on.    Suddenly he stopped at the foot of a tree. \"Halt!\" he cried to the men  who were with him. He leaped from his horse. He stooped and picked up  a bird's nest that had fallen upon the ground. In the nest were some  tiny, half-fledged birds. Their mouths were open for the food they  were expecting their mother to give them.    \"I cannot think of leaving these little things here to be trampled  upon,\" said the general.    He lifted the nest gently and put it in a safe place in the forks of  the tree.    \"Whiz!\" Another cannon ball.    He leaped into the saddle, and away he dashed with his officers close  behind him.    \"Whiz! whiz! whiz!\"    He had done one good deed. He would do many more before the war was  over. \"Boom! boom! boom!\"    The cannon were roaring, the balls were flying, the battle was raging.  But amid all the turmoil and danger, the little birds chirped happily  in the safe shelter where the great general, Robert E. Lee, had placed  them. \"He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and  small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all.\"          SPEAKING A PIECE        Two children, brother and sister, were on their way to school. Both  were very small. The boy was only four years old, and the girl was  not yet six. \"Come, Edward, we must hurry,\" said the sister. \"We must  not be late.\" With one hand the little boy clung to his sister's arm,  and with the other he held his primer.    This primer was his only book, and he loved it. It had a bright blue  cover, which he was careful not to soil. And in it were some odd little  pictures, which he never grew tired of looking at.    Edward could spell nearly all the words in his primer, and he could  read quite well.    The school was more than a mile from their home, and the children  trotted along as fast as their short legs could carry them.    At a place where two roads crossed, they saw a tall gentleman coming  to meet them. He was dressed in black, and had a very pleasant face.    \"Oh, Edward, there is Mr. Harris!\" whispered the little girl. \"Don't  forget your manners.\"    They were glad to see Mr. Harris, for he was the minister. They stopped  by the side of the road and made their manners. Edward bowed very  gracefully, and his sister curtsied.    \"Good morning, children!\" said the minister; and he kindly shook hands  with both.    [Illustration]    \"I have something here for little Edward,\" he said. Then he took from  his pocket a sheet of paper on which some verses were written.    \"See! It is a little speech that I have written for him. The teacher  will soon ask him to speak a piece at school, and I am sure that he  can learn this easily and speak it well\"    Edward took the paper and thanked the kind minister.    \"Mother will help him learn it,\" said his sister.    \"Yes, I will try to learn it,\" said Edward.    \"Do so, my child,\" said the Minister; \"and I hope that when you grow  up you will become a wise man and a great orator.\"    Then the two children hurried on to school.    The speech was not hard to learn, and Edward soon knew every word of  it. When the time came for him to speak, his mother and the minister  were both there to hear him.    He spoke so well that everybody was pleased. He pronounced every word  plainly, as though he were talking to his schoolmates.    Would you like to read his speech? Here it is:--          Pray, how shall I, a little lad,        In speaking make a figure?        You're only joking, I'm afraid--        Just wait till I am bigger.

My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent  at my father's home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of the civil  war.  I was then a child of but five years, yet I well remember the  tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.    He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the  children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those  pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he  would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with  stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world.  We all  loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.    He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over  six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the  trained fighting man.  His features were regular and clear cut, his  hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray,  reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and  initiative.  His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of  a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.    His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight  even in that country of magnificent horsemen.  I have often heard my  father caution him against his wild recklessness, but he would only  laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back  of a horse yet unfoaled.    When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some  fifteen or sixteen years.  When he returned it was without warning, and  I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment,  nor had he changed in any other outward way.  He was, when others were  with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when  he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into  space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery;  and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I  did not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.    He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of  the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was  evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied.  As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent,  in fact he would not talk of them at all.    He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where  he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a  year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market--my father and  I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia  at that time.  Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage,  situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last  visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in  writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript.    He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished  me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment  in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will  there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to  carry out with absolute fidelity.    After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window  standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the  Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.  I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never understood  that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.    Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first  of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to  come to him at once.  I had always been his favorite among the younger  generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.    I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the  morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me  out to Captain Carter's he replied that if I was a friend of the  Captain's he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found  dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached  to an adjoining property.    For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his  place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body  and of his affairs.    I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local  police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study.  The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the  body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it.  It lay,  he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched  above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the  spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen  him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the  skies.    There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a  local physician the coroner's jury quickly reached a decision of death  from heart failure.  Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and  withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would  find my instructions.  They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have  followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.    He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and  that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had  had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated.  The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this  was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.    His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire  income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine.  His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to  retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was  I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.    A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that  the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring  lock which can be opened _only from the inside_.    Yours very sincerely,    Edgar Rice Burroughs.

CHAPTER I    ON THE ARIZONA HILLS      I am a very old man; how old I do not know.  Possibly I am a hundred,  possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other  men, nor do I remember any childhood.  So far as I can recollect I have  always been a man, a man of about thirty.  I appear today as I did  forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living  forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is  no resurrection.  I do not know why I should fear death, I who have  died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as  you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I  believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality.    And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the  story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death.  I cannot  explain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of an  ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that  befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an  Arizona cave.    I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript  until after I have passed over for eternity.  I know that the average  human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not  purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and  held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths  which some day science will substantiate.  Possibly the suggestions  which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in  this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries  of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.
