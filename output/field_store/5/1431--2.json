Clemens)                               Part 4.          CHAPTER XVII    A ROYAL BANQUET    Madame, seeing me pacific and unresentful, no doubt judged that  I was deceived by her excuse; for her fright dissolved away, and  she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill  somebody, that the thing grew to be embarrassing.  However, to my  relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers.  I will  say this much for the nobility: that, tyrannical, murderous,  rapacious, and morally rotten as they were, they were deeply and  enthusiastically religious.  Nothing could divert them from the  regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the  Church.  More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his  enemy at a disadvantage, stop to pray before cutting his throat;  more than once I had seen a noble, after ambushing and despatching  his enemy, retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give  thanks, without even waiting to rob the body.  There was to be  nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini,  that rough-hewn saint, ten centuries later.  All the nobles of  Britain, with their families, attended divine service morning and  night daily, in their private chapels, and even the worst of them  had family worship five or six times a day besides.  The credit  of this belonged entirely to the Church.  Although I was no friend  to that Catholic Church, I was obliged to admit this.  And often,  in spite of me, I found myself saying, \"What would this country  be without the Church?\"    After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was  lighted by hundreds of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and  lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the  hosts.  At the head of the hall, on a dais, was the table of the  king, queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine.  Stretching down the hall  from this, was the general table, on the floor.  At this, above  the salt, sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their  families, of both sexes,--the resident Court, in effect--sixty-one  persons; below the salt sat minor officers of the household, with  their principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteen  persons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standing  behind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another.  It was  a very fine show.  In a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps,  and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to be  the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later  centuries as \"In the Sweet Bye and Bye.\"  It was new, and ought  to have been rehearsed a little more.  For some reason or other  the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner.    After this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table said  a noble long grace in ostensible Latin.  Then the battalion of  waiters broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew,  fetched and carried, and the mighty feeding began; no words  anywhere, but absorbing attention to business.  The rows of chops  opened and shut in vast unison, and the sound of it was like to  the muffled burr of subterranean machinery.    The havoc continued an hour and a half, and unimaginable was the  destruction of substantials.  Of the chief feature of the feast  --the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing  at the start--nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt;  and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all  the other dishes.    With the pastries and so on, the heavy drinking began--and the talk.  Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared, and everybody  got comfortable, then happy, then sparklingly joyous--both sexes,  --and by and by pretty noisy.  Men told anecdotes that were terrific  to hear, but nobody blushed; and when the nub was sprung, the  assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress.  Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made  Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England  hide behind a handkerchief, but nobody hid here, but only laughed  --howled, you may say.  In pretty much all of these dreadful stories,  ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes, but that didn't worry the  chaplain any, he had his laugh with the rest; more than that, upon  invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as  any that was sung that night.    By midnight everybody was fagged out, and sore with laughing; and,  as a rule, drunk: some weepingly, some affectionately, some  hilariously, some quarrelsomely, some dead and under the table.  Of the ladies, the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess, whose  wedding-eve this was; and indeed she was a spectacle, sure enough.  Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the  young daughter of the Regent d'Orleans, at the famous dinner whence  she was carried, foul-mouthed, intoxicated, and helpless, to her bed,  in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime.    Suddenly, even while the priest was lifting his hands, and all  conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming  blessing, there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at  the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired lady,  leaning upon a crutch-stick; and she lifted the stick and pointed it  toward the queen and cried out:    \"The wrath and curse of God fall upon you, woman without pity,  who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this  old heart that had nor chick, nor friend nor stay nor comfort in  all this world but him!\"    Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an  awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with  the death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command:    \"Lay hands on her!  To the stake with her!\"    The guards left their posts to obey.  It was a shame; it was a  cruel thing to see.  What could be done?  Sandy gave me a look;  I knew she had another inspiration.  I said:    \"Do what you choose.\"    She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment.  She indicated  me, and said:    \"Madame, _he_ saith this may not be.  Recall the commandment, or he  will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable  fabric of a dream!\"    Confound it, what a crazy contract to pledge a person to!  What if  the queen--    But my consternation subsided there, and my panic passed off;  for the queen, all in a collapse, made no show of resistance but  gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat.  When she reached  it she was sober.  So were many of the others.  The assemblage rose,  whiffed ceremony to the winds, and rushed for the door like a mob;  overturning chairs, smashing crockery, tugging, struggling,  shouldering, crowding--anything to get out before I should change  my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of  space.  Well, well, well, they _were_ a superstitious lot.  It is  all a body can do to conceive of it.    The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid  to hang the composer without first consulting me.  I was very sorry  for her--indeed, any one would have been, for she was really  suffering; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable, and  had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities.  I therefore  considered the matter thoughtfully, and ended by having the  musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and  Bye again, which they did.  Then I saw that she was right, and  gave her permission to hang the whole band.  This little relaxation  of sternness had a good effect upon the queen.  A statesman gains  little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all  occasions that offer, for this wounds the just pride of his  subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his strength.  A little  concession, now and then, where it can do no harm, is the wiser policy.    Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more, and measurably  happy, her wine naturally began to assert itself again, and it got  a little the start of her.  I mean it set her music going--her silver  bell of a tongue.  Dear me, she was a master talker.  It would not  become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired  man and very sleepy.  I wished I had gone off to bed when I had  the chance.  Now I must stick it out; there was no other way.  So  she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly  hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if  from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek  --with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl.  The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she tilted  her graceful head as a bird does when it listens.  The sound bored  its way up through the stillness again.    \"What is it?\" I said.    \"It is truly a stubborn soul, and endureth long.  It is many hours now.\"    \"Endureth what?\"    \"The rack.  Come--ye shall see a blithe sight.  An he yield not  his secret now, ye shall see him torn asunder.\"    What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so composed and serene,  when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that  man's pain.  Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches,  we tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank  and dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night  --a chill, uncanny journey and a long one, and not made the shorter  or the cheerier by the sorceress's talk, which was about this  sufferer and his crime.  He had been accused by an anonymous  informer, of having killed a stag in the royal preserves.  I said:    \"Anonymous testimony isn't just the right thing, your Highness.  It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7246"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 5.

Clemens)                               Part 5.        CHAPTER XXIII    RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN    Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while.  Merlin  was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering  gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for  of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet.  Finally I said:    \"How does the thing promise by this time, partner?\"    \"Behold, I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest  enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands  of the East; an it fail me, naught can avail.  Peace, until I finish.\"    He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region, and must  have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits, for the wind  was their way, and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and  billowy fog.  He poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted  his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary  way.  At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and  about exhausted.  Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks  and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of  acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all  in a grand state of excitement.  The abbot inquired anxiously for  results.  Merlin said:    \"If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these  waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it.  It has  failed; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is  a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most  potent spirit known to the magicians of the East, and whose name  none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well.  The  mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret  of that spell, and without that secret none can break it.  The  water will flow no more forever, good Father.  I have done what  man could.  Suffer me to go.\"    Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation.  He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:    \"Ye have heard him. Is it true?\"    \"Part of it is.\"    \"Not all, then, not all!  What part is true?\"    \"That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell  upon the well.\"    \"God's wounds, then are we ruined!\"    \"Possibly.\"    \"But not certainly?  Ye mean, not certainly?\"    \"That is it.\"    \"Wherefore, ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell--\"    \"Yes, when he says that, he says what isn't necessarily true.  There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have  some chance--that is, some small, some trifling chance--of success.\"    \"The conditions--\"    \"Oh, they are nothing difficult.  Only these: I want the well  and the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to  myself from sunset to-day until I remove the ban--and nobody  allowed to cross the ground but by my authority.\"    \"Are these all?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you have no fear to try?\"    \"Oh, none.  One may fail, of course; and one may also succeed.  One can try, and I am ready to chance it.  I have my conditions?\"    \"These and all others ye may name.  I will issue commandment  to that effect.\"    \"Wait,\" said Merlin, with an evil smile.  \"Ye wit that he that  would break this spell must know that spirit's name?\"    \"Yes, I know his name.\"    \"And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye  must likewise pronounce it?  Ha-ha!  Knew ye that?\"    \"Yes, I knew that, too.\"    \"You had that knowledge!  Art a fool?  Are ye minded to utter  that name and die?\"    \"Utter it?  Why certainly.  I would utter it if it was Welsh.\"    \"Ye are even a dead man, then; and I go to tell Arthur.\"    \"That's all right.  Take your gripsack and get along.  The thing  for _you_ to do is to go home and work the weather, John W. Merlin.\"    It was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst  weather-failure in the kingdom.  Whenever he ordered up the  danger-signals along the coast there was a week's dead calm, sure,  and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats.  But I kept him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine  his reputation.  However, that shot raised his bile, and instead  of starting home to report my death, he said he would remain  and enjoy it.    My two experts arrived in the evening, and pretty well fagged,  for they had traveled double tides.  They had pack-mules along,  and had brought everything I needed--tools, pump, lead pipe,  Greek fire, sheaves of big rockets, roman candles, colored fire  sprays, electric apparatus, and a lot of sundries--everything  necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle.  They got their  supper and a nap, and about midnight we sallied out through a  solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed  the required conditions.  We took possession of the well and its  surroundings.  My boys were experts in all sorts of things, from  the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical  instrument.  An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in  ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise.  Then we stowed our  fireworks in the chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed.    Before the noon mass was over, we were at the well again; for there  was a deal to do yet, and I was determined to spring the miracle  before midnight, for business reasons: for whereas a miracle  worked for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal, it is  worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday.  In nine hours  the water had risen to its customary level--that is to say, it was  within twenty-three feet of the top.  We put in a little iron pump,  one of the first turned out by my works near the capital; we bored  into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the  well-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long  enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond  the threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to the  two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be  present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at  the proper time.    We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this  hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it down  fast, poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the  bottom, then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they  could loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are;  and they made a portly and imposing sheaf, I can tell you.  We  grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder,  we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the  roof--blue on one corner, green on another, red on another, and  purple on the last--and grounded a wire in each.    About two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of  scantlings, about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so  made a platform.  We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed  for the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot's own throne.  When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want  to get in every detail that will count; you want to make all the  properties impressive to the public eye; you want to make matters  comfortable for your head guest; then you can turn yourself loose  and play your effects for all they are worth.  I know the value of  these things, for I know human nature.  You can't throw too much  style into a miracle.  It costs trouble, and work, and sometimes  money; but it pays in the end.  Well, we brought the wires to  the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the ground  to the platform, and hid the batteries there.  We put a rope fence  a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common  multitude, and that finished the work.  My idea was, doors open  at 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp.  I wished I could  charge admission, but of course that wouldn't answer.  I instructed  my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was  around, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and  make the fur fly.  Then we went home to supper.    The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time;  and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had  been pouring into the valley.  The lower end of the valley was  become one huge camp; we should have a good house, no question  about that.  Criers went the rounds early in the evening and  announced the coming attempt, which put every pulse up to fever  heat.  They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would  move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30, up to which time  all the region which was under my ban must be clear; the bells  would then cease from tolling, and this sign should be permission  to the multitudes to close in and take their places.    I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the  abbot's solemn procession hove in sight--which it did not do till  it was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black  night and no torches permitted.  With it came Merlin, and took  a front seat on the platform; he was as good as his word for once.  One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban,  but they were there, just the same.  The moment the bells stopped,  those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast  black wave, and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow,  and then it solidified itself, and you could have walked upon  a pavement of human heads to--well, miles.    We had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minutes--a thing  I had counted on for effect; it is always good to let your audience  have a chance to work up its expectancy.  At length, out of the  silence a noble Latin chant--men's voices--broke "]]]
