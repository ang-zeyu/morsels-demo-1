W. Clark, illustrated by Gustave Dore.  Clark in his edition states  that, \"The English text of 'Don Quixote' adopted in this edition is that  of Jarvis, with occasional corrections from Motteaux.\" See in the  introduction below John Ormsby's critique of both the Jarvis and Motteaux  translations.  It has been elected in the present Project Gutenberg  edition to attach the famous engravings of Gustave Dore to the Ormsby  translation instead of the Jarvis/Motteaux. The detail of many of the  Dore engravings can be fully appreciated only by utilizing the \"Enlarge\"  button to expand them to their original dimensions.  Ormsby in his  Preface has criticized the fanciful nature  of Dore's illustrations;  others feel that these woodcuts and steel engravings well match the  Quixote's dreams.            D.W.

There are some--and I confess myself to be one--for whom  Shelton's racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no  modern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton  had the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as  Cervantes; \"Don Quixote\" had to him a vitality that only a contemporary  could feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes saw  them; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish of  Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most  likely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his  saddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under the  mulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its  pages.    But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate  popularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, no  doubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority. His  warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representative  of Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very hastily made and  was never revised by him. It has all the freshness and vigour, but also a  full measure of the faults, of a hasty production. It is often very  literal--barbarously literal frequently--but just as often very loose. He  had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of Spanish, but apparently not  much more. It never seems to occur to him that the same translation of a  word will not suit in every case.    It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of \"Don  Quixote.\" To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of  truism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly  satisfactory translation of \"Don Quixote\" into English or any other  language. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable,  or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no doubt, are so  superabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness to which the  humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spanish, and can at  best be only distantly imitated in any other tongue.    The history of our English translations of \"Don Quixote\" is instructive.  Shelton's, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608,  but not published till 1612. This of course was only the First Part. It  has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#1)"],[1,"QUIXOTE    Volume II.

Now I say that \"with his spurs, he is on his way.\" Should he  reach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to Your  Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as to  dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under  the name of"]]]
