A Hundred Years Afterward        1.  \"Once on a Time\"    I am going to tell a story, one of those tales of astonishing  adventures that happened years and years and years ago.  Perhaps you  wonder why it is that so many stories are told of \"once on a time\", and  so few of these days in which we live; but that is easily explained.    In the old days, when the world was young, there were no automobiles  nor flying-machines to make one wonder; nor were there railway trains,  nor telephones, nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people  keyed up to a high pitch of excitement.  Men and women lived simply and  quietly.  They were Nature's children, and breathed fresh air into  their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas; and tramped through green  meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars; and went to  bed when it grew dark and rose with the sun--which is vastly different  from the present custom.  Having no books to read they told their  adventures to one another and to their little ones; and the stories  were handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed.    Those who peopled the world in the old days, having nothing but their  hands to depend on, were to a certain extent helpless, and so the  fairies were sorry for them and ministered to their wants patiently and  frankly, often showing themselves to those they befriended.    So people knew fairies in those days, my dear, and loved them, together  with all the ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings  that belong to the hordes of immortals.  And a fairy tale was a thing  to be wondered at and spoken of in awed whispers; for no one thought of  doubting its truth.    To-day the fairies are shy; for so many curious inventions of men have  come into use that the wonders of Fairyland are somewhat tame beside  them, and even the boys and girls can not be so easily interested or  surprised as in the old days.  So the sweet and gentle little immortals  perform their tasks unseen and unknown, and live mostly in their own  beautiful realms, where they are almost unthought of by our busy,  bustling world.    Yet when we come to story-telling the marvels of our own age shrink  into insignificance beside the brave deeds and absorbing experiences of  the days when fairies were better known; and so we go back to \"once on  a time\" for the tales that we most love--and that children have ever  loved since mankind knew that fairies exist.        2.  The Enchanted Isle    Once there was an enchanted island in the middle of the sea.  It was  called the Isle of Yew.  And in it were five important kingdoms ruled  by men, and many woodland dells and forest glades and pleasant meadows  and grim mountains inhabited by fairies.    From the fairies some of the men had learned wonderful secrets, and had  become magicians and sorcerers, with powers so great that the entire  island was reputed to be one of enchantments.  Who these men were the  common people did not always know; for while some were kings and  rulers, others lived quietly hidden away in forests or mountains, and  seldom or never showed themselves.  Indeed, there were not so many of  these magicians as people thought, only it was so hard to tell them  from common folk that every stranger was regarded with a certain amount  of curiosity and fear.    The island was round--like a mince pie.  And it was divided into four  quarters--also like a pie--except that there was a big place in the  center where the fifth kingdom, called Spor, lay in the midst of the  mountains.  Spor was ruled by King Terribus, whom no one but his own  subjects had ever seen--and not many of them.  For no one was allowed  to enter the Kingdom of Spor, and its king never left his palace.  But  the people of Spor had a bad habit of rushing down from their mountains  and stealing the goods of the inhabitants of the other four kingdoms,  and carrying them home with them, without offering any apologies  whatever for such horrid conduct.  Sometimes those they robbed tried to  fight them; but they were a terrible people, consisting of giants with  huge clubs, and dwarfs who threw flaming darts, and the stern Gray Men  of Spor, who were most frightful of all.  So, as a rule, every one fled  before them, and the people were thankful that the fierce warriors of  Spor seldom came to rob them oftener than once a year.    It was on this account that all who could afford the expense built  castles to live in, with stone walls so thick that even the giants of  Spor could not batter them down.  And the children were not allowed to  stray far from home for fear some roving band of robbers might steal  them and make their parents pay large sums for their safe return.    Yet for all this the people of the Enchanted Isle of Yew were happy and  prosperous.  No grass was greener, no forests more cool and delightful,  no skies more sunny, no sea more blue and rippling than theirs.    And the nations of the world envied them, but dared not attempt to  conquer an island abounding in enchantments.        3.  The Fairy Bower    That part of the Enchanted Isle which was kissed by the rising sun was  called Dawna; the kingdom that was tinted rose and purple by the  setting sun was known as Auriel, and the southland, where fruits and  flowers abounded, was the kingdom of Plenta.  Up at the north lay Heg,  the home of the great barons who feared not even the men of Spor; and  in the Kingdom of Heg our story opens.    Upon a beautiful plain stood the castle of the great Baron  Merd--renowned alike in war and peace, and second in importance only to  the King of Heg.  It was a castle of vast extent, built with thick  walls and protected by strong gates.  In front of it sloped a pretty  stretch of land with the sea glistening far beyond; and back of it, but  a short distance away, was the edge of the Forest of Lurla.    One fair summer day the custodian of the castle gates opened a wicket  and let down a draw-bridge, when out trooped three pretty girls with  baskets dangling on their arms.  One of the maids walked in front of  her companions, as became the only daughter of the mighty Baron Merd.  She was named Seseley, and had yellow hair and red cheeks and big, blue  eyes.  Behind her, merry and laughing, yet with a distinct deference to  the high station of their young lady, walked Berna and Helda--dark  brunettes with mischievous eyes and slender, lithe limbs.  Berna was  the daughter of the chief archer, and Helda the niece of the captain of  the guard, and they were appointed play-fellows and comrades of the  fair Seseley.    Up the hill to the forest's edge ran the three, and then without  hesitation plunged into the shade of the ancient trees.  There was no  sunlight now, but the air was cool and fragrant of nuts and mosses, and  the children skipped along the paths joyously and without fear.    To be sure, the Forest of Lurla was well known as the home of fairies,  but Seseley and her comrades feared nothing from such gentle creatures  and only longed for an interview with the powerful immortals whom they  had been taught to love as the tender guardians of mankind.  Nymphs  there were in Lurla, as well, and crooked knooks, it was said; yet for  many years past no person could boast the favor of meeting any one of  the fairy creatures face to face.    So, gathering a few nuts here and a sweet forest flower there, the  three maidens walked farther and farther into the forest until they  came upon a clearing--formed like a circle--with mosses and ferns for  its carpet and great overhanging branches for its roof.    \"How pretty!\" cried Seseley, gaily.  \"Let us eat our luncheon in this  lovely banquet-hall!\"    So Berna and Helda spread a cloth and brought from their baskets some  golden platters and a store of food.  Yet there was little ceremony  over the meal, you may be sure, and within a short space all the  children had satisfied their appetites and were laughing and chatting  as merrily as if they were at home in the great castle.  Indeed, it is  certain they were happier in their forest glade than when facing grim  walls of stone, and the three were in such gay spirits that whatever  one chanced to say the others promptly joined in laughing over.    Soon, however, they were startled to hear a silvery peal of laughter  answering their own, and turning to see whence the sound proceeded,  they found seated near them a creature so beautiful that at once the  three pairs of eyes opened to their widest extent, and three hearts  beat much faster than before.    \"Well, I must say you DO stare!\" exclaimed the newcomer, who was  clothed in soft floating robes of rose and pearl color, and whose eyes  shone upon them like two stars.    \"Forgive our impertinence,\" answered the little Lady Seseley, trying to  appear dignified and unmoved; \"but you must acknowledge that you came  among us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#1)"],[1,"THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT                   FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA      AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION,           :       CIVIL ACTION  INC., et al.                            :                                          :  v.                                      :                                          :  UNITED STATES, et al.                   :       NO. 01-1303  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  MULTNOMAH COUNTY PUBLIC                 :       CIVIL ACTION  LIBRARY, et al.                         :                                          :  v.                                      :                                          :  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.        :       NO. 01-1322              Before: BECKER, Chief Circuit Judge,          FULLAM and BARTLE, District Judges.

Preliminary Statement    This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use  of filtering software by public libraries a condition of the  receipt of federal funding.  The Internet, as is well known, is a  vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of  computers around the world.  Its most familiar feature is the  World Wide Web (the \"Web\"), a network of computers known as  servers that provide content to users.  The Internet provides  easy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute  information to a worldwide audience; it is used by more than 143  million Americans.  Indeed, much of the world's knowledge  accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost  instantly.  Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the  Internet access it at public libraries.  And approximately 95% of  all public libraries in the United States provide public access  to the Internet.      While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the  amount of information  available to its users is self-evident,  its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse result   facilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore  pornography within the easy reach not only of adults who have  every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or  child pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom  it may be quite harmful.  The volume of pornography on the  Internet is huge, and the record before us demonstrates that  public library patrons of all ages, many from ages 11 to 15, have  regularly sought to access it in public library settings.  There  are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed  for free and without providing any registration information, and  tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography.  Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a  number of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal  (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to find the  content they desire.  Some libraries have trained patrons in how  to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or have  directed their patrons to \"preferred\" Web sites that librarians  have reviewed.  Other libraries have utilized such devices as  recessing the computer monitors, installing privacy screens, and  monitoring implemented by a \"tap on the shoulder\" of patrons  perceived to be offending library policy.  Still others, viewing  the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some  librarians do not wish to confront patrons), have purchased  commercially available software that blocks certain categories of  material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in  their facilities.  Indeed, 7% of American public libraries use  blocking software for adults.  Although such programs are  somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography,  they are blunt instruments that not only \"underblock,\" i.e., fail  to block access to substantial amounts of content that the  library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this  litigation, \"overblock,\" i.e., block access to large quantities  of material that library boards do not wish to exclude and that  is constitutionally protected.      Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to  block sexually explicit speech.  While most libraries include in  their physical collection copies of volumes such as The Joy of  Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex, which contain quite explicit  photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large  quantities of other, comparable information about health and  sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web.  One  teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library  was the only venue in which she could obtain information  important to her about her own sexuality.  Another library patron  witness described using the Internet to research breast cancer  and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery.   Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for  health and education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of   overblocking constitutionally protected material.  Moreover, as  we explain below, the filtering software on which the parties  presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information  relating to health and sexuality that might be mistaken for  pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and  sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or  inappropriate for adults or minors.      The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards,  enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (\"CIPA\"), Pub. L.  No. 106-554, which makes the use of filters by a public library a  condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that are  important (or even critical) to the budgets of many public  libraries  grants under the Library Services and Technology Act,  20 U.S.C. Sec. 9101 et seq. (\"LSTA\"), and so-called \"E-rate  discounts\" for Internet access and support under the  Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254.  LSTA grant funds are  awarded, inter alia, in order to: (1) assist libraries in  accessing information through electronic networks, and (2)  provide targeted library and information services to persons  having difficulty using a library and to underserved and rural  communities, including children from families with incomes below  the poverty line.  E-rate discounts serve the similar purpose of  extending Internet access to schools and libraries in low-income  communities.  CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive  LSTA funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a  \"technology protection measure\" that prevents patrons from  accessing \"visual depictions\" that are \"obscene,\" \"child  pornography,\" or in the case of minors, \"harmful to minors.\"  20  U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(B) & (C) (E-  rate).      The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations,  library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit  against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is  facially unconstitutional because: (1) it induces public  libraries to violate their patrons' First Amendment rights  contrary to the requirements of South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S.  203 (1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their  First Amendment rights as a condition on the receipt of "]]]
