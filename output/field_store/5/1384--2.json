HUMBOLDT'S PERSONAL NARRATIVE    VOLUME 1.    PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF TRAVELS TO THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS OF AMERICA  DURING THE YEARS 1799-1804    BY    ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT AND AIME BONPLAND.        TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF    ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT    AND EDITED BY    THOMASINA ROSS.        IN THREE VOLUMES    VOLUME 1.      LONDON.    GEORGE BELL & SONS.  1907.  LONDON: PORTUGAL ST., LINCOLN'S INN.  CAMBRIDGE: DEIGHTON, BELL AND CO.  NEW YORK: THE MACMILLAN CO.  BOMBAY: A.H. WHEELER AND CO.      EDITOR'S PREFACE.    The increasing interest attached to all that part of the American  Continent situated within and near the tropics, has suggested the  publication of the present edition of Humboldt's celebrated work,  as a portion of the SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY.    Prior to the travels of Humboldt and Bonpland, the countries  described in the following narrative were but imperfectly known to  Europeans. For our partial acquaintance with them we were chiefly  indebted to the early navigators, and to some of the followers of  the Spanish Conquistadores. The intrepid men whose courage and  enterprise prompted them to explore unknown seas for the discovery  of a New World, have left behind them narratives of their  adventures, and descriptions of the strange lands and people they  visited, which must ever be perused with curiosity and interest;  and some of the followers of Pizarro and Cortez, as well as many  learned Spaniards who proceeded to South America soon after the  conquest, were the authors of historical and other works of high  value. But these writings of a past age, however curious and  interesting, are deficient in that spirit of scientific  investigation which enhances the importance and utility of accounts  of travels in distant regions. In more recent times, the researches  of La Condamine tended in a most important degree to promote  geographical knowledge; and he, as well as other eminent botanists  who visited the coasts of South America, and even ascended the  Andes, contributed by their discoveries and collections to augment  the vegetable riches of the Old World. But, in their time, geology  as a science had little or no existence. Of the structure of the  giant mountains of our globe scarcely anything was understood;  whilst nothing was known beneath the earth in the New World, except  what related to her mines of gold and silver.    It remained for Humboldt to supply all that was wanting, by the  publication of his Personal Narrative. In this, more than in any  other of his works, he shows his power of contemplating nature in  all her grandeur and variety.    The researches and discoveries of Humboldt's able coadjutor and  companion, M. Bonpland, afford not only a complete picture of the  botany of the equinoctial regions of America, but of that of other  places visited by the travellers on their voyage thither. The  description of the Island of Teneriffe and the geography of its  vegetation, show how much was discovered by Humboldt and Bonpland  which had escaped the observation of discerning travellers who had  pursued the same route before them. Indeed, the whole account of  the Canary Islands presents a picture which cannot be contemplated  without the deepest interest, even by persons comparatively  indifferent to the study of nature.    It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to remind the reader that since  the time when this work was first published in Paris, the  separation of the Spanish Colonies from the mother-country,  together with subsequent political events, have wrought great  changes in the governments of the South American States, as well as  in the social condition of their inhabitants. One consequence of  these changes has been to render obsolete some facts and  observations relating to subjects, political, commercial, and  statistical, interspersed through this work. However useful such  matter might have been on its original publication, it is wholly  irrelevant to the existing state of things, and consequently it has  been deemed advisable to omit it. By this curtailment, together  with that of some meteorological tables and discussions of very  limited interest, the work has been divested of its somewhat  lengthy and discursive character, and condensed within dimensions  better adapted to the taste and requirements of the present time.    An English translation of this work by Helen Maria Williams, was  published many years ago, and is now out of print. Though faultless  as respects correctness of interpretation, it abounds in foreign  turns of expression, and is somewhat deficient in that fluency of  style without which a translated work is unsatisfactory to the  English reader. In the edition now presented to the public it is  hoped that these objections are in some degree removed.    A careful English version is given of all the Spanish and  Portuguese terms, phrases, and quotations which occur in this work.  Though the author has only in some few instances given a French  translation of these passages, yet it is presumed that the  interpretation of the whole in English will not be deemed  superfluous; this new edition of the \"Personal Narrative\" having  been undertaken with the view of presenting the work in the form  best suited for the instruction and entertainment of the general  reader.    T.R.    London, December 1851.    ***    MEASURES:    In this narrative, as well as in the Political Essay on New Spain,  all the prices are reckoned in piastres, and silver reals (reales  de plata). Eight of these reals are equivalent to a piastre, or one  hundred and five sous, French money (4 shillings 4 1/2 pence  English). Nouv. Esp. volume 2 pages 519, 616 and 866.    The magnetic dip is always measured in this work, according to the  centesimal division, if the contrary be not expressly mentioned.    One flasco contains 70 or 80 cubic inches, Paris measure.    112 English pounds = 105 French pounds; and 160 Spanish pounds = 93  French pounds.    An arpent des eaux et forets, or legal acre of France, of which 1.  95 = 1 hectare. It is about 1 1/4 acre English.    A tablon, equal to 1849 square toises, contains nearly an acre and  one-fifth: a legal acre has 1344 square toises, and 1.95 legal acre  is equal one hectare.    For the sake of accuracy, the French Measures, as given by the  Author, and the indications of the Centigrade Thermometer, are  retained in the translation. The following tables may, therefore,  be found useful.    TABLE OF LINEAR MEASURE.      1 toise = 6 feet 4.73 inches.    1 foot  = 12.78 inches.    1 metre = 3 feet 3.37 inches.    (Transcriber's Note: The 'toise' was introduced by Charlemagne  in 790; it originally represented the distance between the  fingertips of a man with outstretched arms, and is thus the same  as the British 'fathom'. During the founding of the Metric System,  less than 20 years before the date of this work, the 'toise' was  assigned a value of 1.949 meters, or a little over two yards. The  'foot'; actually the 'French foot', or 'pied', is defined as  1/6 of a 'toise', and is a little over an English foot.)    CENTIGRADE THERMOMETER REDUCED TO FAHRENHEIT'S SCALE.    Cent. Fahr.

PROVINCIAL MUSEUM, VICTORIA B. C.          PREFACE.      The present list is intended to include all birds which have been so  far proven to occur in British Columbia.    I am fully aware of its incompleteness, and very much regret much of  its lack of more definite information regarding the distribution of  certain species, and with regard to that portion of the Province in  north and northeastern interior, which, I have no doubt, is a valuable  field for work.    Since the publication of the list of British Columbia birds in 1898 by  the late John Fannin, which contained 339 species and sub-species, and  with the information to hand, enables me to add to this 24.    I wish to extend my thanks especially to the following constant  observers for more or less extended local lists, notes and  specimens:--A. C. Brooks, Chilliwhack, Okanagan and Cariboo; Rev.  J. H. Keen, Queen Charlotte Islands and Metlakatla; Thos. Kermode,  William Head Quarantine Station; E. P. Venables, Yernon; Chas. de  Blois Green, Fairview and Keremeos.    I have also obtained valuable information from the check-list  published by the late John Fannin.      FRANCIS KERMODE,    _Curator Provincial Museum_.    _Victoria, B. C., August, 1904_.
