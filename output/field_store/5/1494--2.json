Although the immediate results of the Battle of Hastings may have  been of less importance to the world than were those of some other  great battles, the struggle has, in the long run, had a greater  influence upon the destiny of mankind than any other similar event  that has ever taken place. That admixture of Saxon, Danish, and  British races which had come to be known under the general name of  English, was in most respects far behind the rest of Europe. The  island was, as it had always been,--except during the rule of two  or three exceptionally strong kings,--distracted by internal  dissensions. Broad lines of division still separated the North  from the South, and under weak Kings the powerful Earls became  almost independent. The enterprise that had distinguished their  Saxon and Danish ancestors seems to have died out. There was a  general indisposition to change, and except in her ecclesiastical  buildings, England made but little progress in civilization from  the time of Alfred to that of Harold. Its insular position cut it  off from taking part in that rapid advance which, beginning in  Italy, was extending throughout Europe. The arrival, however, of  the impetuous Norman race, securing as it did a close connection  with the Continent, quickened the intellect of the people, raised  their intelligence, was of inestimable benefit to the English, and  played a most important part in raising England among the nations.  Moreover, it has helped to produce the race that has peopled Northern  America, Australia, and the south of Africa, holds possession of  India, and stands forth as the greatest civilizer in the world. The  Conquest of England by the Normans was achieved without even a  shadow of right or justice. It was at the time an unmixed curse to  England; but now we can recognize the enormous benefits that accrued  when in his turn the Englishman conquered the Norman, and the foreign  invaders became an integral portion of the people they had overcome.  For the historical details of the story, I have only had to go to  Freeman's magnificent _History of the Norman Conquest of England_,  which I hope will be perused by all of my readers who are able to  obtain it.

CHAPTER I.      A QUARREL.    The great Abbey of Westminster was approaching its completion; an  army of masons and labourers swarmed like bees upon and around it,  and although differing widely in its massive architecture, with  round Saxon windows and arches, from the edifice that was two or  three generations later to be reared in its place,--to serve as a  still more fitting tomb for the ashes of its pious founder,--it was  a stately abbey, rivalling the most famous of the English fanes of  the period.    From his palace hard by King Edward had watched with the deepest  interest the erection of the minster that was the dearest object  of his life. The King was surrounded by Normans, the people among  whom he had lived until called from his retirement to ascend the  throne of England, and whom he loved far better than those over  whom he reigned. He himself still lived almost the life of a recluse.  He was sincerely anxious for the good of his people, but took small  pains to ensure it, his life being largely passed in religious  devotions, and in watching over the rise of the abbey he had founded.    A town had risen around minster and palace, and here the workmen  employed found their lodgings, while craftsmen of all descriptions  administered to the wants both of these and of the nobles of Edward's  court.    From one of the side doors of the palace a page, some fifteen or  sixteen years of age, ran down the steps in haste. He was evidently  a Saxon by his fair hair and fresh complexion, and any observer of  the time would have seen that he must, therefore, be in the employment  of Earl Harold, the great minister, who had for many years virtually  ruled England in the name of its king.    The young page was strongly and sturdily built. His garb was an  English one, but with some admixture of Norman fashions. He wore  tightly-fitting leg coverings, a garment somewhat resembling a  blouse of blue cloth girded in by a belt at the waist, and falling  in folds to the knee. Over his shoulders hung a short mantle of  orange colour with a hood. On his head was a cap with a wide brim  that was turned up closely behind, and projected in a pointed shovel  shape in front. In his belt was a small dagger. He wore shoes of  light yellow leather fastened by bands over the insteps. As he ran  down the steps of the palace he came into sharp contact with another  page who had just turned the corner of the street.    \"I crave your pardon, Walter Fitz-Urse,\" he said hurriedly, \"but I  was in haste and saw you not.\"    The other lad was as clearly Norman as the speaker was  Saxon. He was perhaps a year the senior in point of age, and  taller by half a head, but was of slighter build. The expression  of his face differed as widely from that of the Saxon as did  his swarthy complexion and dark hair, for while the latter  face wore a frank and pleasant expression, that of the Norman  was haughty and arrogant.    \"You did it on purpose,\" he said angrily, \"and were we not  under the shadow of the palace I would chastise you as you  deserve.\"    The smile died suddenly out from the Saxon's face. \"Chastise  me!\" he repeated. \"You would find it somewhat difficult,  Master Fitz-Urse. Do you think you are talking to a Norman  serf? You will please to remember you are in England; but if  you are not satisfied with my apology, I will ride with you a  few miles into the country, and we will then try with equal  arms where the chastisement is to fall.\"    The Norman put his hand to his dagger, but there was an  ominous growl from some men who had paused to listen to the  quarrel.    \"You are an insolent boor, Wulf of Steyning, and some day  I will punish you as you deserve.\"    \"Some day,\" the Saxon laughed, \"we shall, I hope, see you  and all your tribe sent across the Channel. There are few of  us here who would not see your backs with pleasure.\"    \"What is this?\" an imperious voice demanded; and turning  round, Wulf saw William, the Norman Bishop of London, who,  followed by several monks and pages, had pushed his way  through the crowd. \"Walter Fitz-Urse, what means this altercation?\"    \"The Saxon ran against me of set purpose, my lord,\" Walter Fitz-Urse  said, in tones of deep humility, \"and because I complained he  challenged me to ride with him into the country to fight, and then  he said he hoped that some day all the Normans would be sent across  the Channel.\"    \"Is this so?\" the prelate said sternly to Wulf; \"did you  thus insult not only my page, but all of us, his countrymen?\"    \"I ran against him by accident,\" Wulf said, looking up fearlessly  in the prelate's face. \"I apologized, though I know not that I was  more in fault than he; but instead of taking my apology as one of  gentle blood should do, he spoke like a churl, and threatened me  with chastisement, and then I did say that I hoped he and all other  Normans in the land would some day be packed across the Channel.\"    \"Your ears ought to be slit as an insolent varlet.\"    \"I meant no insolence, my Lord Bishop; and as to the slitting of  my ears, I fancy Earl Harold, my master, would have something to  say on that score.\"    The prelate was about to reply, but glancing at the angry faces of  the growing crowd, he said coldly:    \"I shall lay the matter before him. Come, Walter, enough of this.  You are also somewhat to blame for not having received more courteously  the apologies of this saucy page.\"    The crowd fell back with angry mutterings as he turned, and, followed  by Walter Fitz-Urse and the ecclesiastics, made his way along the  street to the principal entrance of the palace. Without waiting  to watch his departure, Wulf, the Saxon page, pushed his way through  the crowd, and went off at full speed to carry the message with  which he had been charged.    \"Our king is a good king,\" a squarely-built man,--whose bare arms  with the knotted muscles showing through the skin, and hands begrimed  with charcoal, indicated that he was a smith,--remarked to a gossip  as the little crowd broke up, \"but it is a grievous pity that he  was brought up a Norman, still more that he was not left in peace  to pass his life as a monk as he desired. He fills the land with  his Normans; soon as an English bishop dies, straightway a Norman  is clapped into his place. All the offices at court are filled  with them, and it is seldom a word of honest English is spoken in  the palace. The Norman castles are rising over the land, and his  favourites divide among them the territory of every English earl  or thane who incurs the king's displeasure. Were it not for Earl  Harold, one might as well be under Norman sway altogether.\"    \"Nay, nay, neighbour Ulred, matters are not so bad as that. I dare  say they would have been as you say had it not been for Earl Godwin  and his sons.

CHAPTER I.    FAMILY--SCHOOL--COLLEGE.      In the seventeenth century it was not the custom to publish two  volumes upon every man or woman whose name had appeared on a  title-page. Nor, where lives of authors were written, were they  written with the redundancy of particulars which is now allowed.  Especially are the lives of the poets and dramatists obscure and  meagrely recorded. Of Milton, however, we know more personal details  than of any man of letters of that age. Edward Phillips, the poet's  nephew, who was brought up by his uncle, and lived in habits of  intercourse with him to the last, wrote a life, brief, inexact,  superficial, but valuable from the nearness of the writer to the  subject of his memoir. A cotemporary of Milton, John Aubrey (b.1625),  \"a very honest man, and accurate in his accounts of matters of fact,\"  as Toland says of him, made it his business to learn all he could  about Milton's habits. Aubrey was himself acquainted with Milton, and  diligently catechised thepoet's widow, his brother, and his nephew,  scrupulously writing down each detail as it came to him, in the  minutee of lives which he supplied to Antony Wood to be worked up in  his _Athenae_ and _Fasti_. Aubrey was only an antiquarian collector,  and was mainly dependent on what could be learned from the family.  None of Milton's family, and least of all Edward Phillips, were of a  capacity to apprehend moral or mental qualities, and they could only  tell Aubrey of his goings out and his comings in, of the clothes  he wore, the dates of events, the names of his acquaintance. In  compensation for the want of observation on the part of his own kith  and kin, Milton himself, with a superb and ingenuous egotism,  has revealed the secret of his thoughts and feelings in numerous  autobiographical passages of his prose writings. From what he directly  communicates, and from what he unconsciously betrays, we obtain an  internal life of the mind, more ample than that external life of the  bodily machine, which we owe to Aubrey and Phillips.    In our own generation all that printed books or written documents  have preserved about Milton has been laboriously brought together by  Professor David Masson, in whose _Life of Milton_ we have the most  exhaustive biography that ever was compiled of any Englishman. It is a  noble and final monument erected to the poet's memory, two centuries  after his death. My excuse for attempting to write of Milton alter Mr.  Masson is that his life is in six volumes octavo, with a total of some  four to five thousand pages. The present outline is written for a  different class of readers, those, namely, who cannot afford to know  more of Milton than can be told in some two hundred and fifty pages.    A family of Miltons, deriving the name in all probability from the  parish of Great Milton near Thame, is found in various branches spread  over Oxfordshire and the adjoining counties in the reign of Elisabeth.  The poet's grandfather was a substantial yeoman, living at Stanton St.  John, about five miles from Oxford, within the forest of Shotover, of  which he was also an under-ranger. The ranger's son John was at school  in Oxford, possibly as a chorister, conformed to the Established  Church, and was in consequence cast off by his father, who adhered  to the old faith. The disinherited son went up to London, and by  the assistance of a friend was set up in business as a scrivener. A  scrivener discharged some of the functions which, at the present day,  are undertaken for us in a solicitor's office. John Milton the father,  being a man of probity and force of character, was soon on the way to  acquire \"a plentiful fortune.\" But he continued to live over his shop,  which was in Bread Street, Cheapside, and which bore the sign of the  Spread Eagle, the family crest.    It was at the Spread Eagle that his eldest son, John Milton, was  born, 9th December, 1608, being thus exactly contemporary with Lord  Clarendon, who also died in the same year as the poet. Milton must be  added to the long roll of our poets who have been natives of the  city which now never sees sunlight or blue sky, along with Chaucer,  Spenser, Herrick, Cowley, Shirley, Ben Jonson, Pope, Gray, Keats.  Besides attending as a day-scholar at St. Paul's School, which was  close at hand, his father engaged for him a private tutor at home. The  household of the Spread Eagle not only enjoyed civic prosperity, but  some share of that liberal cultivation, which, if not imbibed in the  home, neither school nor college ever confers. The scrivener was not  only an amateur in music, but a composer, whose tunes, songs, and airs  found their way into the best collections of music. Both schoolmaster  and tutor were men of mark. The high master of St. Paul's at that time  was Alexander Gill, an M.A. of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who was  \"esteemed to have such an excellent way of training up youth, that  none in his time went beyond it.\" The private tutor was Thomas Young,  who was, or had been, curate to Mr. Gataker, of Rotherhithe, itself  a certificate of merit, even if we had not the pupil's emphatic  testimony of gratitude. Milton's fourth elegy is addressed to Young,  when, in 1627, he was settled at Hamburg, crediting him with having  first infused into his pupil a taste for classic literature and  poetry. Biographers have derived Milton's Presbyterianism in 1641 from  the lessons twenty years before of this Thomas Young, a Scotchman,  and one of the authors of the _Smectymnuus_. This, however, is a  misreading of Milton's mind--a mind which was an organic whole--\"whose  seed was in itself,\" self-determined; not one whose opinions can be  accounted for by contagion or casual impact.    Of Milton's boyish exercises two have bean preserved. They are English  paraphrases of two of the Davidic Psalms, and were done at the age of  fifteen. That they were thought by himself worth printing in the same  volume with _Comus_, is the most noteworthy thing about them. No words  are so commonplace but that they can be made to yield inference by a  biographer. And even in these school exercises we think we can discern  that the future poet was already a diligent reader of Sylvester's _Du  Bartas_ (1605), the patriarch of Protestant poetry, and of Fairfax's  _Tasso_ (1600). There are other indications that, from very early  years, poetry had assumed a place in Milton's mind, not merely as a  juvenile pastime, but as an occupation of serious import.    Young Gill, son of the high master, a school-fellow of Milton, went  up to Trinity, Oxford, where he got into trouble by being informed  against by Chillingworth, who reported incautious political speeches  of Gill to his godfather, Laud. With Gill Milton corresponded; they  exchanged their verses, Greek, Latin, and English, with a confession  on Milton's part that he prefers English and Latin composition to  Greek; that to write Greek verses in this age is to sing to the deaf.  Gill, Milton finds \"a severe critic of poetry, however disposed to be  lenient to his friend's attempts.\"    If Milton's genius did not announce itself in his paraphrases of  Psalms, it did in his impetuosity in learning, \"which I seized with  such eagerness that from the twelfth year of my age, I scarce ever  went to bed before midnight.\" Such is his own account. And it  is worthnotice that we have here an incidental test of the  trustworthiness of Aubrey's reminiscences. Aubrey's words are, \"When  he was very young he studied very hard, and sate up very late,  commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night; and his father ordered  the maid to sit up for him.\"    He was ready for college at sixteen, not earlier than the usual age  at that period. As his schoolmasters, both the Gills, were Oxford men  (Young was of St. Andrew's), it might have been expected that the  young scholar would have been placed at Oxford. However, it was  determined that he should go to Cambridge, where he was admitted a  pensioner of Christ's, 12th February, 1625, and commenced residence in  the Easter term ensuing. Perhaps his father feared the growing High  Church, or, as it was then called, Arminianism, of his own university.  It so happened, however, that the tutor to whom the young Milton was  consigned was specially noted for Arminian proclivities. This was  William Chappell, then Fellow of Christ's, who so recommended himself  to Laud by his party zeal, that he was advanced to be Provost of  Dublin and Bishop of Cork.    Milton was one of those pupils who are more likely to react against  a tutor than to take a ply from him. A preaching divine--Chappell  composed a treatise on the art of preaching--a narrow ecclesiastic of  the type loved by Land, was exactly the man who would drive Milton  into opposition. But the tutor of the seventeenth century was not  able, like the easy-going tutor of the eighteenth, to leave the young  rebel to pursue"]]]
