AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION      The scene of this romance is laid in the fifteenth century, when the  feudal system, which had been the sinews and nerves of national defence,  and the spirit of chivalry, by which, as by a vivifying soul, that  system was animated, began to be innovated upon and abandoned by those  grosser characters who centred their sum of happiness in procuring the  personal objects on which they had fixed their own exclusive attachment.  The same egotism had indeed displayed itself even in more primitive  ages; but it was now for the first time openly avowed as a professed  principle of action. The spirit of chivalry had in it this point  of excellence, that, however overstrained and fantastic many of its  doctrines may appear to us, they were all founded on generosity and self  denial, of which, if the earth were deprived, it would be difficult to  conceive the existence of virtue among the human race.    Among those who were the first to ridicule and abandon the self denying  principles in which the young knight was instructed and to which he  was so carefully trained up, Louis XI of France was the chief. That  sovereign was of a character so purely selfish--so guiltless of  entertaining any purpose unconnected with his ambition, covetousness,  and desire of selfish enjoyment--that he almost seems an incarnation of  the devil himself, permitted to do his utmost to corrupt our ideas  of honour in its very source. Nor is it to be forgotten that Louis  possessed to a great extent that caustic wit which can turn into  ridicule all that a man does for any other person's advantage but his  own, and was, therefore, peculiarly qualified to play the part of a cold  hearted and sneering fiend.    The cruelties, the perjuries, the suspicions of this prince, were  rendered more detestable, rather than amended, by the gross and debasing  superstition which he constantly practised. The devotion to the heavenly  saints, of which he made such a parade, was upon the miserable principle  of some petty deputy in office, who endeavours to hide or atone for the  malversations of which he is conscious by liberal gifts to those whose  duty it is to observe his conduct, and endeavours to support a system of  fraud by an attempt to corrupt the incorruptible. In no other light can  we regard his creating the Virgin Mary a countess and colonel of his  guards, or the cunning that admitted to one or two peculiar forms of  oath the force of a binding obligation which he denied to all other,  strictly preserving the secret, which mode of swearing he really  accounted obligatory, as one of the most valuable of state mysteries.    To a total want of scruple, or, it would appear, of any sense whatever  of moral obligation, Louis XI added great natural firmness and sagacity  of character, with a system of policy so highly refined, considering the  times he lived in, that he sometimes overreached himself by giving way  to its dictates.    Probably there is no portrait so dark as to be without its softer  shades. He understood the interests of France, and faithfully pursued  them so long as he could identify them with his own. He carried the  country safe through the dangerous crisis of the war termed \"for the  public good;\" in thus disuniting and dispersing this grand and dangerous  alliance of the great crown vassals of France against the Sovereign, a  king of a less cautious and temporizing character, and of a more bold  and less crafty disposition than Louis XI, would, in all probability,  have failed. Louis had also some personal accomplishments not  inconsistent with his public character. He was cheerful and witty in  society; and none was better able to sustain and extol the superiority  of the coarse and selfish reasons by which he endeavoured to supply  those nobler motives for exertion which his predecessors had derived  from the high spirit of chivalry.    In fact, that system was now becoming ancient, and had, even while  in its perfection, something so overstrained and fantastic in its  principles, as rendered it peculiarly the object of ridicule, whenever,  like other old fashions, it began to fall out of repute; and the weapons  of raillery could be employed against it, without exciting the disgust  and horror with which they would have been rejected at an early period,  as a species of blasphemy. The principles of chivalry were cast aside,  and their aid supplied by baser stimulants. Instead of the high spirit  which pressed every man forward in the defence of his country, Louis  XI substituted the exertions of the ever ready mercenary soldier, and  persuaded his subjects, among whom the mercantile class began to make a  figure, that it was better to leave to mercenaries the risks and labours  of war, and to supply the Crown with the means of paying them, than to  peril themselves in defence of their own substance. The merchants were  easily persuaded by this reasoning. The hour did not arrive in the days  of Louis XI when the landed gentry and nobles could be in like manner  excluded from the ranks of war; but the wily monarch commenced that  system, which, acted upon by his successors, at length threw the whole  military defence of the state into the hands of the Crown.    He was equally forward in altering the principles which were wont to  regulate the intercourse of the sexes. The doctrines of chivalry had  established, in theory at least, a system in which Beauty was the  governing and remunerating divinity--Valour, her slave, who caught his  courage from her eye and gave his life for her slightest service. It is  true, the system here, as in other branches, was stretched to fantastic  extravagance, and cases of scandal not unfrequently arose. Still, they  were generally such as those mentioned by Burke, where frailty was  deprived of half its guilt, by being purified from all its grossness.  In Louis XI's practice, it was far otherwise. He was a low voluptuary,  seeking pleasure without sentiment, and despising the sex from whom he  desired to obtain it.... By selecting his favourites and ministers from  among the dregs of the people, Louis showed the slight regard which he  paid to eminent station and high birth; and although this might be  not only excusable but meritorious, where the monarch's fiat promoted  obscure talent, or called forth modest worth, it was very different when  the King made his favourite associates of such men as the chief of his  police, Tristan l'Hermite..    Nor were Louis's sayings and actions in private or public of a kind  which could redeem such gross offences against the character of a man  of honour. His word, generally accounted the most sacred test of a man's  character, and the least impeachment of which is a capital offence  by the code of honour, was forfeited without scruple on the slightest  occasion, and often accompanied by the perpetration of the most enormous  crimes... It is more than probable that, in thus renouncing almost  openly the ties of religion, honour, and morality, by which mankind  at large feel themselves influenced, Louis sought to obtain great  advantages in his negotiations with parties who might esteem themselves  bound, while he himself enjoyed liberty. He started from the goal, he  might suppose, like the racer who has got rid of the weights with which  his competitors are still encumbered, and expects to succeed of course.  But Providence seems always to unite the existence of peculiar danger  with some circumstance which may put those exposed to the peril upon  their guard. The constant suspicion attached to any public person who  becomes badly eminent for breach of faith is to him what the rattle is  to the poisonous serpent: and men come at last to calculate not so much  on what their antagonist says as upon that which he is likely to do;  a degree of mistrust which tends to counteract the intrigues of such a  character, more than his freedom from the scruples of conscientious men  can afford him advantage..    Indeed, although the reign of Louis had been as successful in a  political point of view as he himself could have desired, the spectacle  of his deathbed might of itself be a warning piece against the seduction  of his example. Jealous of every one, but chiefly of his own son,  he immured himself in his Castle of Plessis, intrusting his person  exclusively to the doubtful faith of his Scottish mercenaries. He never  stirred from his chamber; he admitted no one into it, and wearied heaven  and every saint with prayers, not for forgiveness of his sins, but  for the prolongation of his life. With a poverty of spirit totally  inconsistent with his shrewd worldly sagacity, he importuned his  physicians until they insulted as well as plundered him..    It was not the least singular circumstance of this course, that bodily  health and terrestrial felicity seemed to be his only object. Making  any mention of his sins when talking on the state of his health, was  strictly prohibited; and when at his command a priest recited a prayer  to Saint Eutropius in which he recommended the King's welfare both in  body and soul, Louis caused the two last words to be omitted, saying it  was not prudent to importune the blessed saint by too many requests at  once. Perhaps he thought by being silent on his crimes he might suffer  them to pass out of the recollection of the celestial patrons, whose aid  he invoked for his body.    So great were the well merited tortures of this tyrant's deathbed, that  Philip de Comines enters into a regular comparison between them and the  numerous cruelties inflicted on others by his order; and considering  both, comes to express an opinion that the worldly pangs and agony  suffered by Louis were such as might compensate the crimes he had  committed, and that, after a reasonable quarantine in purgatory, he  might in mercy he found duly qualified for the superior"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#1)"],[1,"Franks, John B.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE    The object of a translator should ever be to hold the mirror up to his  author. That being so, his chief duty is to represent so far as  practicable the manner in which his author's ideas have been expressed,  retaining if possible at the sacrifice of idiom and taste all the  peculiarities of his author's imagery and of language as well. In regard  to translations from the Sanskrit, nothing is easier than to dish up Hindu  ideas, so as to make them agreeable to English taste. But the endeavour of  the present translator has been to give in the following pages as literal  a rendering as possible of the great work of Vyasa. To the purely English  reader there is much in the following pages that will strike as ridiculous.  Those unacquainted with any language but their own are generally very  exclusive in matters of taste. Having no knowledge of models other than  what they meet with in their own tongue, the standard they have formed of  purity and taste in composition must necessarily be a narrow one. The  translator, however, would ill-discharge his duty, if for the sake of  avoiding ridicule, he sacrificed fidelity to the original. He must  represent his author as he is, not as he should be to please the narrow  taste of those entirely unacquainted with him. Mr. Pickford, in the  preface to his English translation of the Mahavira Charita, ably defends a  close adherence to the original even at the sacrifice of idiom and taste  against the claims of what has been called 'Free Translation,' which means  dressing the author in an outlandish garb to please those to whom he is  introduced.    In the preface to his classical translation of Bhartrihari's Niti Satakam  and Vairagya Satakam, Mr. C.H. Tawney says, \"I am sensible that in the  present attempt I have retained much local colouring. For instance, the  ideas of worshipping the feet of a god or great men, though it frequently  occurs in Indian literature, will undoubtedly move the laughter of  Englishmen unacquainted with Sanskrit, especially if they happen to belong  to that class of readers who revel their attention on the accidental and  remain blind to the essential. But a certain measure of fidelity to the  original even at the risk of making oneself ridiculous, is better than the  studied dishonesty which characterises so many translations of oriental  poets.\"    We fully subscribe to the above although, it must be observed, the censure  conveyed to the class of translators last indicated is rather undeserved,  there being nothing like a 'studied dishonesty' in their efforts which  proceed only from a mistaken view of their duties and as such betray only  an error of the head but not of the heart. More than twelve years ago when  Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy, with Babu Durga Charan Banerjee, went to my  retreat at Seebpore, for engaging me to translate the Mahabharata into  English, I was amazed with the grandeur of the scheme. My first question  to him was,--whence was the money to come, supposing my competence for the  task. Pratapa then unfolded to me the details of his plan, the hopes he  could legitimately cherish of assistance from different quarters. He was  full of enthusiasm. He showed me Dr. Rost's letter, which, he said, had  suggested to him the undertaking. I had known Babu Durga Charan for many  years and I had the highest opinion of his scholarship and practical good  sense. When he warmly took Pratapa's side for convincing me of the  practicability of the scheme, I listened to him patiently. The two were  for completing all arrangements with me the very day. To this I did not  agree. I took a week's time to consider. I consulted some of my literary  friends, foremost among whom was the late lamented Dr. Sambhu C.  Mookherjee. The latter, I found, had been waited upon by Pratapa. Dr.  Mookherjee spoke to me of Pratapa as a man of indomitable energy and  perseverance. The result of my conference with Dr. Mookherjee was that I  wrote to Pratapa asking him to see me again. In this second interview  estimates were drawn up, and everything was arranged as far as my portion  of the work was concerned. My friend left with me a specimen of  translation which he had received from Professor Max Muller. This I began  to study, carefully comparing it sentence by sentence with the original.  About its literal character there could be no doubt, but it had no flow  and, therefore, could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader.  The translation had been executed thirty years ago by a young German  friend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did  without at all impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was  set up in type and a dozen sheets were struck off. These were submitted to  the judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of  them, I was glad to see, approved of the specimen, and then the task of  translating the Mahabharata into English seriously began.    Before, however, the first fasciculus could be issued, the question as to  whether the authorship of the translation should be publicly owned, arose.  Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy was against anonymity. I was for it. The reasons  I adduced were chiefly founded upon the impossibility of one person  translating the whole of the gigantic work. Notwithstanding my resolve to  discharge to the fullest extent the duty that I took up, I might not live  to carry it out. It would take many years before the end could be reached.  Other circumstances than death might arise in consequence of which my  connection with the work might cease. It could not be desirable to issue  successive fasciculus with the names of a succession of translators  appearing on the title pages. These and other considerations convinced my  friend that, after all, my view was correct. It was, accordingly, resolved  to withhold the name of the translator. As a compromise, however, between  the two views, it was resolved to issue the first fasciculus with two  prefaces, one over the signature of the publisher and the other headed--  'Translator's Preface.' This, it was supposed, would effectually guard  against misconceptions of every kind. No careful reader would then  confound the publisher with the author.    Although this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been  accomplished, an influential Indian journal came down upon poor Pratapa  Chandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary  imposture, viz., of posing before the world as the translator of Vyasa's  work when, in fact, he was only the publisher. The charge came upon my  friend as a surprise, especially as he had never made a secret of the  authorship in his correspondence with Oriental scholars in every part of  the world. He promptly wrote to the journal in question, explaining the  reasons there were for anonymity, and pointing to the two prefaces with  which the first fasciculus had been given to the world. The editor readily  admitted his mistake and made a satisfactory apology.    Now that the translation has been completed, there can no longer be any  reason for withholding the name of the translator. The entire translation  is practically the work of one hand. In portions of the Adi and the Sabha  Parvas, I was assisted by Babu Charu Charan Mookerjee. About four forms of  the Sabha Parva were done by Professor Krishna Kamal Bhattacharya, and  about half a fasciculus during my illness, was done by another hand. I  should however state that before passing to the printer the copy received  from these gentlemen I carefully compared every sentence with the original,  making such alterations as were needed for securing a uniformity of style  with the rest of the work.    I should here observe that in rendering the Mahabharata into English I  have derived very little aid from the three Bengali versions that are  supposed to have been executed with care. Every one of these is full of  inaccuracies and blunders of every description. The Santi in particular  which is by far the most difficult of the eighteen Parvas, has been made a  mess of by the Pundits that attacked it. Hundreds of ridiculous blunders  can be pointed out in both the Rajadharma and the Mokshadharma sections.  Some of these I have pointed out in footnotes.    I cannot lay claim to infallibility. There are verses in the Mahabharata  that are exceedingly difficult to construe. I have derived much aid from  the great commentator Nilakantha. I know that Nilakantha's authority is  not incapable of being challenged. But when it is remembered that the  interpretations given by Nilakantha came down to him from preceptors of  olden days, one should think twice before rejecting Nilakantha as a guide.    About the readings I have adopted, I should say that as regards the first  half of the work, I have generally adhered to the Bengal texts; as regards  the latter half, to the printed Bombay edition. Sometimes individual  sections, as occurring in the Bengal editions, differ widely, in respect  of the order of the verses, from the corresponding ones in the Bombay  edition. In such cases I have adhered to the Bengal texts, convinced that  the sequence of ideas has been better preserved in the Bengal editions  than the Bombay one.    I should express my particular obligations to Pundit Ram Nath Tarkaratna,  the author of 'Vasudeva"]]]
