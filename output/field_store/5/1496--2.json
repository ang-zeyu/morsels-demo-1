H. F. CARY        PURGATORY    Cantos 1 - 33        CANTO I    O'er better waves to speed her rapid course  The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,  Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;  And of that second region will I sing,  In which the human spirit from sinful blot  Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.    Here, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train  I follow, here the deadened strain revive;  Nor let Calliope refuse to sound  A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,  Which when the wretched birds of chattering note  Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.    Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread  O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,  High up as the first circle, to mine eyes  Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd  Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,  That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.  The radiant planet, that to love invites,  Made all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath  The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.    To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind  On the' other pole attentive, where I saw  Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken  Of our first parents.  Heaven of their rays  Seem'd joyous.  O thou northern site, bereft  Indeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!    As from this view I had desisted, straight  Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,  There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,  I saw an old man standing by my side  Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,  That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.  Low down his beard and mix'd with hoary white  Descended, like his locks, which parting fell  Upon his breast in double fold.  The beams  Of those four luminaries on his face  So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear  Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.    \"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,  Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?\"  He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.  \"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure  Lights you emerging from the depth of night,  That makes the infernal valley ever black?  Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss  Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,  That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?\"    My guide, then laying hold on me, by words  And intimations given with hand and head,  Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay  Due reverence; then thus to him replied.    \"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven  Descending, had besought me in my charge  To bring.  But since thy will implies, that more  Our true condition I unfold at large,  Mine is not to deny thee thy request.  This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.  But erring by his folly had approach'd  So near, that little space was left to turn.  Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd  To work his rescue, and no way remain'd  Save this which I have ta'en.  I have display'd  Before him all the regions of the bad;  And purpose now those spirits to display,  That under thy command are purg'd from sin.  How I have brought him would be long to say.  From high descends the virtue, by whose aid  I to thy sight and hearing him have led.  Now may our coming please thee.  In the search  Of liberty he journeys: that how dear  They know, who for her sake have life refus'd.  Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet  In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,  That in the last great day will shine so bright.  For us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:  He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,  Abiding in that circle where the eyes  Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look  Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.  Then by her love we' implore thee, let us pass  Through thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks  I for thy favour will to her return,  If mention there below thou not disdain.\"    \"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,\"  He then to him rejoin'd, \"while I was there,  That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.  Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,  She may no longer move me, by that law,  Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.  Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,  Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.  Enough for me that in her name thou ask.  Go therefore now: and with a slender reed  See that thou duly gird him, and his face  Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.  For not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,  Would it be seemly before him to come,  Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.  This islet all around, there far beneath,  Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed  Produces store of reeds. No other plant,  Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,  There lives, not bending to the water's sway.  After, this way return not; but the sun  Will show you, that now rises, where to take  The mountain in its easiest ascent.\"    He disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd  Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,  Toward him turn'd mine eyes.  He thus began;  \"My son! observant thou my steps pursue.  We must retreat to rearward, for that way  The champain to its low extreme declines.\"    The dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,  Which deaf before it, so that from afar  I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.    We travers'd the deserted plain, as one  Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step  Trodden in vain till he regain the path.    When we had come, where yet the tender dew  Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh  The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;  Both hands extended on the watery grass  My master plac'd, in graceful act and kind.  Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,  Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.  There to my visage he anew restor'd  That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.    Then on the solitary shore arriv'd,  That never sailing on its waters saw  Man, that could after measure back his course,  He girt me in such manner as had pleas'd  Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!  As he selected every humble plant,  Wherever one was pluck'd, another there  Resembling, straightway in its place arose.          CANTO II    Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,  That covers, with the most exalted point  Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,  And night, that opposite to him her orb  Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,  Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd  When she reigns highest: so that where I was,  Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek  To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.    Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,  Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought  Journey, while motionless the body rests.  When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,  Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam  Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;  So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,  A light so swiftly coming through the sea,  No winged course might equal its career.  From which when for a space I had withdrawn  Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,  Again I look'd and saw it grown in size  And brightness: thou on either side appear'd  Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,  And by degrees from underneath it came  Another.  My preceptor silent yet  Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,  Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew  The pilot, cried aloud, \"Down, down; bend low  Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:  Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.    \"Lo how all human means he sets at naught!  So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail  Except his wings, between such distant shores.  Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,  Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,  That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!\"    As more and more toward us came, more bright  Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye  Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.  He drove ashore in a small bark so swift  And light, that in its course no wave it drank.  The heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,  Visibly written blessed in his looks.    Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.  \"In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;\"  All with one voice together sang, with what  In the remainder of that hymn is writ.  Then soon as with the sign of holy cross  He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,  The swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,  There left, appear'd astounded with the place,  Gazing around as one who sees new sights.    From every side the sun darted his beams,  And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n  Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe  Lifting their eyes towards us: \"If ye know,  Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.\"    Them Virgil answer'd.  \"Ye suppose perchance  Us well acquainted with this place: but here,  We, as yourselves, are strangers.  Not long erst  We came, before you but a little space,  By other road so rough and hard, that now  The' ascent will seem to us as play.\"  The spirits,  Who from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,  Grew pale with wonder.  As the multitude  Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,  To hear what news he brings, and in their haste  Tread one another down, e'en so at sight  Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one  Forgetful of its errand, to depart,  Where cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair.    Then one I saw darting before the rest  With such fond ardour to embrace me, I  To do the like was mov'd.  O shadows vain  Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands  I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd  Empty into my breast again.  Surprise  I needs must think was painted in my looks,  For that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.  To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice  Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.  Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,  To talk with me, it would a little pause.

In heav'n,  That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,  Witness of things, which to relate again  Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;  For that, so near approaching its desire  Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd,  That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,  That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm  Could store, shall now be matter of my song.    Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,  And make me such a vessel of thy worth,  As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.  Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows  Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both  For my remaining enterprise Do thou  Enter into my bosom, and there breathe  So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd  Forth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine!  If thou to me of shine impart so much,  That of that happy realm the shadow'd form  Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,  Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree  Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;  For to that honour thou, and my high theme  Will fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!  To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath  Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills  Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring  From the Pierian foliage, when one breast  Is with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small spark  Great flame hath risen: after me perchance  Others with better voice may pray, and gain  From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.    Through diver passages, the world's bright lamp  Rises to mortals, but through that which joins  Four circles with the threefold cross, in best  Course, and in happiest constellation set  He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives  Its temper and impression.  Morning there,  Here eve was by almost such passage made;  And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,  Blackness the other part; when to the left  I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun  Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.  As from the first a second beam is wont  To issue, and reflected upwards rise,  E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,  So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd  Into my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,  Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes  Upon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,  That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place  Made for the dwelling of the human kind    I suffer'd it not long, and yet so long  That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,  As iron that comes boiling from the fire.  And suddenly upon the day appear'd  A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,  Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.    Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,  Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken  Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd  At her aspect, such inwardly became  As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,  That made him peer among the ocean gods;  Words may not tell of that transhuman change:  And therefore let the example serve, though weak,  For those whom grace hath better proof in store    If I were only what thou didst create,  Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,  Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.  Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,  Desired Spirit! with its harmony  Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,  Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze  With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made  A lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,  And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,  Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.    Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,  To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,  Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:  \"With false imagination thou thyself  Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,  Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.  Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;  For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place  Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd.\"    Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt,  By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,  Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,  And said: \"Already satisfied, I rest  From admiration deep, but now admire  How I above those lighter bodies rise.\"    Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,  She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,  As on her frenzied child a mother casts;  Then thus began: \"Among themselves all things  Have order; and from hence the form, which makes  The universe resemble God.  In this  The higher creatures see the printed steps  Of that eternal worth, which is the end  Whither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,  In this their order, diversely, some more,  Some less approaching to their primal source.  Thus they to different havens are mov'd on  Through the vast sea of being, and each one  With instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;  This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,  This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,  This the brute earth together knits, and binds.  Nor only creatures, void of intellect,  Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,  That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd.  That Providence, who so well orders all,  With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,  In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,  Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat  Predestin'd, we are carried by the force  Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,  But at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,  That as ofttimes but ill accords the form  To the design of art, through sluggishness  Of unreplying matter, so this course  Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who  Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;  As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,  From its original impulse warp'd, to earth,  By vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire  Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse  Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height.  There would in thee for wonder be more cause,  If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself  Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.\"    So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.          CANTO II    All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,  Eager to listen, on the advent'rous track  Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,  Backward return with speed, and your own shores  Revisit, nor put out to open sea,  Where losing me, perchance ye may remain  Bewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I pass  Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,  Apollo guides me, and another Nine  To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.  Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck.  Timely for food of angels, on which here  They live, yet never know satiety,  Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out  Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad  Before you in the wave, that on both sides  Equal returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er  To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,  When they saw Jason following the plough.    The increate perpetual thirst, that draws  Toward the realm of God's own form, bore us  Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.    Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,  And in such space as on the notch a dart  Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself  Arriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight.  Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,  Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,  Bespake me: \"Gratefully direct thy mind  To God, through whom to this first star we come.\"    Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,  Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,  Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit  Within itself the ever-during pearl  Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light  Receives, and rests unbroken.  If I then  Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend  Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus  Another could endure, which needs must be  If body enter body, how much more  Must the desire inflame us to behold  That essence, which discovers by what means  God and our nature join'd!  There will be seen  That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,  But in itself intelligibly plain,  E'en as the truth that man at first believes.    I answered: \"Lady! I with thoughts devout,  Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,  Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.  But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots  Upon this body, which below on earth  Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\"    She somewhat smil'd, then spake: \"If mortals err  In their opinion, when the key of sense  Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen  Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings  Of reason to pursue the senses' flight  Are short.  But what thy own thought is, declare.\"    Then I: \"What various here above appears,  Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.\"    She then resum'd: \"Thou certainly wilt see  In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well  Thou listen to the arguments, which I  Shall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays  Numberless lights, the which in kind and size  May be remark'd of different aspects;  If rare or dense of that were cause alone,  One single virtue then would be in all,  Alike distributed, or more, or less.  Different virtues needs must be the fruits  Of formal principles, and these, save one,  Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside,  If rarity were of that dusk the cause,  Which thou inquirest, either in some part  That planet must throughout be void, nor fed  With its own"]]]
