They heard, and up they sprung upon the wing    Innumerable. As when the potent rod    Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,    Waved round the coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud    Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind    That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung    Like night, and darken'd all the realm of Nile,    So numberless were they.    *    *    *    *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *    All in a moment through the gloom were seen    Ten thousand banners rise into the air,    With orient colours waving. With them rose    A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms    Appear'd, and serried shields, in thick array,    Of depth immeasurable.      Paradise Lost.      Every age has its peculiar folly--some scheme, project, or phantasy  into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love of gain, the  necessity of excitement, or the mere force of imitation. Failing in  these, it has some madness, to which it is goaded by political or  religious causes, or both combined. Every one of these causes  influenced the Crusades, and conspired to render them the most  extraordinary instance upon record of the extent to which popular  enthusiasm can be carried. History in her solemn page informs us, that  the crusaders were but ignorant and savage men, that their motives were  those of bigotry unmitigated, and that their pathway was one of blood  and tears. Romance, on the other hand, dilates upon their piety and  heroism and pourtrays in her most glowing and impassioned hues their  virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honour they acquired for  themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity.  In  the following pages we shall ransack the stores of both, to discover  the true spirit that animated the motley multitude who took up arms in  the service of the Cross, leaving history to vouch for facts, but not  disdaining the aid of contemporary poetry and romance to throw light  upon feelings, motives, and opinions.    In order to understand thoroughly the state of public feeling in Europe  at the time when Peter the Hermit preached the holy war, it will be  necessary to go back for many years anterior to that event. We must  make acquaintance with the pilgrims of the eighth, ninth, and tenth  centuries, and learn the tales they told of the dangers they had  passed, and the wonders they had seen. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land  seem at first to have been undertaken by converted Jews, and by  Christian devotees of lively imagination, pining with a natural  curiosity to visit the scenes which of all others were most interesting  in their eyes. The pious and the impious alike flocked to  Jerusalem,--the one class to feast their sight on the scenes hallowed  by the life and sufferings of their Lord, and the other, because it  soon became a generally received opinion, that such a pilgrimage was  sufficient to rub off the long score of sins, however atrocious.  Another and very numerous class of pilgrims were the idle and roving,  who visited Palestine then as the moderns visit Italy or Switzerland  now, because it was the fashion, and because they might please their  vanity by retailing, on their return, the adventures they had met with.  But the really pious formed the great majority. Every year their  numbers increased, until at last they became so numerous as to be  called the \"armies of the Lord.\" Full of enthusiasm, they set the  danger and difficulty of the way at defiance, and lingered with holy  rapture on every scene described in the Evangelists. To them it was  bliss indeed to drink the clear waters of the Jordan, or be baptized in  the same stream where John had baptized the Saviour. They wandered with  awe and pleasure in the purlieus of the Temple, on the solemn Mount of  Olives, or the awful Calvary, where a God had bled for sinful men. To  these pilgrims every object was precious. Relics were eagerly sought  after; flagons of water from Jordan, or paniers of mould from the hill  of the Crucifixion, were brought home, and sold at extravagant prices  to churches and monasteries. More apocryphical relics, such as the wood  of the true cross, the tears of the Virgin Mary, the hems of her  garments, the toe-nails and hair of the Apostles--even the tents that  Paul had helped to manufacture--were exhibited for sale by the knavish  in Palestine, and brought back to Europe \"with wondrous cost and care.\"  A grove of a hundred oaks would not have furnished all the wood sold in  little morsels as remnants of the true cross; and the tears of Mary, if  collected together, would have filled a cistern.    For upwards of two hundred years the pilgrims met with no impediment in  Palestine. The enlightened Haroun Al Reschid, and his more immediate  successors, encouraged the stream which brought so much wealth into  Syria, and treated the wayfarers with the utmost courtesy.  The race of  Fatemite caliphs,--who, although in other respects as tolerant, were  more distressed for money, or more unscrupulous in obtaining it, than  their predecessors of the house of Abbas,--imposed a tax of a bezant  for each pilgrim that entered Jerusalem.  This was a serious hardship  upon the poorer sort, who had begged their weary way across Europe, and  arrived at the bourne of all their hopes without a coin. A great outcry  was immediately raised, but still the tax was rigorously levied. The  pilgrims unable to pay were compelled to remain at the gate of the holy  city until some rich devotee arriving with his train, paid the tax and  let them in. Robert of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror, who,  in common with many other nobles of the highest rank, undertook the  pilgrimage, found on his arrival scores of pilgrims at the gate,  anxiously expecting his coming to pay the tax for them. Upon no  occasion was such a boon refused.    The sums drawn from this source were a mine of wealth to the Moslem  governors of Palestine, imposed as the tax had been at a time when  pilgrimages had become more numerous than ever. A strange idea had  taken possession of the popular mind at the close of the tenth and  commencement of the eleventh century. It was universally believed that  the end of the world was at hand; that the thousand years of the  Apocalypse were near completion, and that Jesus Christ would descend  upon Jerusalem to judge mankind. All Christendom was in commotion. A  panic terror seized upon the weak, the credulous, and the guilty, who  in those days formed more than nineteen twentieths of the population.  Forsaking their homes, kindred, and occupation, they crowded to  Jerusalem to await the coming of the Lord, lightened, as they imagined,  of a load of sin by their weary pilgrimage. To increase the panic, the  stars were observed to fall from heaven, earthquakes to shake the land,  and violent hurricanes to blow down the forests. All these, and more  especially the meteoric phenomena, were looked upon as the forerunners  of the approaching judgments. Not a meteor shot athwart the horizon  that did not fill a district with alarm, and send away to Jerusalem a  score of pilgrims, with staff in hand and wallet on their back, praying  as they went for the remission of their sins.  Men, women, and even  children, trudged in droves to the holy city, in expectation of the day  when the heavens would open, and the Son of God descend in his glory.  This extraordinary delusion, while it augmented the numbers, increased  also the hardships of the pilgrims. Beggars became so numerous on all  the highways between the west of Europe and Constantinople that the  monks, the great alms-givers upon these occasions, would have brought  starvation within sight of their own doors, if they had not economized  their resources, and left the devotees to shift for themselves as they  could. Hundreds of them were glad to subsist upon the berries that  ripened by the road, who, before this great flux, might have shared the  bread and flesh of the monasteries.    But this was not the greatest of their difficulties. On their arrival  in Jerusalem they found that a sterner race had obtained possession of  the Holy Land. The caliphs of Bagdad had been succeeded by the harsh  Turks of the race of Seljook, who looked upon the pilgrims with  contempt and aversion. The Turks of the eleventh century were more  ferocious and less scrupulous than the Saracens of the tenth. They were  annoyed at the immense number of pilgrims who overran the country, and  still more so because they showed no intention of quitting it. The  hourly expectation of the last judgment kept them waiting; and the  Turks, apprehensive of being at last driven from the soil by the swarms  that were still arriving, heaped up difficulties in their way.  Persecution of every kind awaited them. They were plundered, and beaten  with stripes, and kept in suspense for months at the gates of  Jerusalem, unable to pay the golden bezant that was to facilitate their  entrance.    When the first epidemic terror of the day of judgment began to subside,  a few pilgrims ventured to return to Europe, their hearts big with  indignation at the insults they had suffered. Everywhere as they passed  they related to a sympathizing auditory the wrongs of Christendom.  Strange to say, even these recitals increased the mania for pilgrimage.  The greater the dangers of the way, the more chance that sins of deep  dye would be atoned for. Difficulty and suffering only heightened the  merit, and fresh hordes issued from every town and village, to win  favour in the sight of Heaven by a visit to the holy sepulchre.

LITTLE JACK HORNER--GOOD-BYE          THE BOBBSEY TWINS IN THE COUNTRY        CHAPTER I    THE INVITATION    \"There goes the bell! It's the letter carrier! Let me answer!\" Freddie  exclaimed.    \"Oh, let me! It's my turn this week!\" cried Flossie.    \"But I see a blue envelope. That's from Aunt Sarah!\" the brother cried.    Meanwhile both children, Freddie and Flossie, were making all possible  efforts to reach the front door, which Freddie finally did by jumping  over the little divan that stood in the way, it being sweeping day.    \"I beat you,\" laughed the boy, while his sister stood back,  acknowledging defeat.    \"Well, Dinah had everything in the way and anyhow, maybe it was your  turn. Mother is in the sewing room, I guess!\" Flossie concluded, and so  the two started in search of the mother, with the welcome letter from  Aunt Sarah tight in Freddie's chubby fist.    Freddie and Flossie were the younger of the two pairs of twins that  belonged to the Bobbsey family. The little ones were four years old,  both with light curls framing pretty dimpled faces, and both being just  fat enough to be good-natured. The other twins, Nan and Bert, were  eight years old, dark and handsome, and as like as \"two peas\" the  neighbors used to say. Some people thought it strange there should be  two pairs of twins in one house, but Nan said it was just like  four-leaf clovers, that always grow in little patches by themselves.    This morning the letter from Aunt Sarah, always a welcome happening,  was especially joyous.    \"Do read it out loud,\" pleaded Flossie, when the blue envelope had been  opened in the sewing room by Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"When can we go?\" broke in Freddie, at a single hint that the missive  contained an invitation to visit Meadow Brook, the home of Aunt Sarah  in the country.    \"Now be patient, children,\" the mother told them. \"I'll read the  invitation in just a minute,\" and she kept her eyes fastened on the  blue paper in a way that even to Freddie and Flossie meant something  very interesting.    \"Aunt Sarah wants to know first how we all are.\"    \"Oh, we're all well,\" Freddie interrupted, showing some impatience.    \"Do listen, Freddie, or we won't hear,\" Flossie begged him, tugging at  his elbow.    \"Then she says,\" continued the mother, \"that this is a beautiful summer  at Meadow Brook.\"    \"Course it is. We know that!\" broke in Freddie again.    \"Freddie!\" pleaded Flossie.    \"And she asks how we would like to visit them this summer.\"  \"Fine,  like it--lovely!\" the little boy almost shouted, losing track of words  in his delight.    \"Tell her we'll come, mamma,\" went on Freddie. \"Do send a letter quick  won't you, mamma?\"    \"Freddie Bobbsey!\" spoke up Flossie, in a little girl's way of showing  indignation. \"If you would only keep quiet we could hear about going,  but--you always stop mamma. Please, mamma, read the rest,\" and the  golden head was pressed against the mother's shoulder from the arm of  the big rocking chair.    \"Well, I was only just saying--\" pouted Freddie.    \"Now listen, dear.\" The mother went on once more reading from the  letter: \"Aunt Sarah says Cousin Harry can hardly wait until vacation  time to see Bert, and she also says, 'For myself I cannot wait to see  the babies. I want to hear Freddie laugh, and I want to hear Flossie  \"say her piece,\" as she did last Christmas, then I just want to hug  them both to death, and so does their Uncle Daniel.'\"    \"Good!--goody!\" broke in the irrepressible Freddie again. \"I'll just  hug Aunt Sarah this way,\" and he fell on his mother's neck and squeezed  until she cried for him to stop.    \"I guess she'll like that,\" Freddie wound up, in real satisfaction at  his hugging ability.    \"Not if you spoil her hair,\" Flossie insisted, while the overcome  mother tried to adjust herself generally.    \"Is that all?\" Flossie asked.    \"No, there is a message for Bert and Nan too, but I must keep that for  lunch time. Nobody likes stale news,\" the mother replied.    \"But can't we hear it when Bert and Nan come from school?\" coaxed  Flossie.    \"Of course,\" the mother assured her. \"But you must run out in the air  now. We have taken such a long time to read the letter.\"    \"Oh, aren't you glad!\" exclaimed Flossie to her brother, as they ran  along the stone wall that edged the pretty terrace in front of their  home.    \"Glad! I'm just--so glad--so glad--I could almost fly up in the air!\"  the boy managed to say in chunks, for he had never had much experience  with words, a very few answering for all his needs.    The morning passed quickly to the little ones, for they had so much to  think about now, and when the school children appeared around the  corner Flossie and Freddie hurried to meet Nan and Bert, to tell them  the news.    \"We're going! we're going!\" was about all Freddie could say.    \"Oh, the letter came--from Aunt Sarah!\" was Flossie's way of telling  the news. But it was at the lunch table that Mrs. Bobbsey finished the  letter.    \"'Tell Nan,'\" she read, \"'that Aunt Sarah has a lot of new patches and  tidies to show her, and tell her I have found a new kind of jumble  chocolate that I am going to teach her to make.' There, daughter, you  see,\" commented Mrs. Bobbsey, \"Aunt Sarah has not forgotten what a good  little baker you are.\"    \"Chocolate jumble,\" remarked Bert, and smacked his lips. \"Say, Nan, be  sure to learn that. It sounds good,\" the brother declared.    Just then Dinah, the maid, brought in the chocolate, and the children  tried to tell her about going to the country, but so many were talking  at once that the good-natured colored girl interrupted the confusion  with a hearty laugh.    \"Ha! ha! ha! And all you-uns be goin' to de country!\"    \"Yes, Dinah,\" Mrs. Bobbsey told her, \"and just listen to what Aunt  Sarah says about you,\" and once more the blue letter came out, while  Mrs. Bobbsey read:    \"'And be sure to bring dear old Dinah! We have plenty of room, and she  will so enjoy seeing the farming.'\"    \"Farming! Ha! ha! Dat I do like. Used to farm all time home in  Virginie!\" the maid declared. \"And I likes it fuss-rate! Yes, Dinah'll  go and hoe de corn and\" (aside to Bert) \"steal de watermelons!\"    The prospects were indeed bright for a happy time in the country, and  the Bobbseys never disappointed themselves when fun was within their  reach.        CHAPTER II    THE START    With so much to think about, the few weeks that were left between  vacation and the country passed quickly for the Bobbseys. As told in  any first book, \"The Bobbsey Twins,\" this little family had a splendid  home in Lakeport, where Mr. Bobbsey was a lumber merchant. The mother  and father were both young themselves, and always took part in their  children's joys and sorrows, for there were sorrows sometimes. Think of  poor little Freddie getting shut up all alone in a big store with only  a little black kitten, \"Snoop,\" to keep him from being scared to death;  that was told of in the first book, for Freddie went shopping one day  with his mamma, and wandered off a little bit. Presently he found  himself in the basement of the store; there he had so much trouble in  getting out he fell asleep in the meantime. Then, when he awoke and it  was all dark, and the great big janitor came to rescue  him--oh!--Freddie thought the man might even be a giant when he first  heard the janitor's voice in the dark store.    Freddie often got in trouble, but like most good little boys he was  always saved just at the right time, for they say good children have  real angels watching over them. Nan, Bert, and Flossie all had plenty  of exciting experiences too, as told in \"The Bobbsey Twins,\" for among  other neighbors there was Danny Rugg, a boy who always tried to make  trouble for Bert, and sometimes almost succeeded in getting Bert into  \"hot water,\" as Dinah expressed it.    Of course Nan had her friends, as all big girls have, but Bert, her  twin brother, was her dearest chum, just as Freddie was Flossie's.    \"When we get to the country we will plant trees, go fishing, and pick  blackberries,\" Nan said one day.    \"Yes, and I'm going with Harry out exploring,\" Bert announced.    \"I'm just going to plant things,\" prim little Flossie lisped. \"I just  love melons and ice cream and--\"    \"Ice cream! Can you really plant ice cream?\" Freddie asked innocently,  which made the others all laugh at Flossie's funny plans.    \"I'm going to have chickens,\" Freddie told them. \"I'm going to have one  of those queer chicken coops that you shut up tight and when you open  it it's just full of little 'kippies.'\"    \"Oh, an incubator, you mean,\" Nan explained. \"That's a machine for  raising chickens without any mother.\"    \"But mine are going to have a mother,\" Freddie corrected, thinking how  sad little chickens would be without a kind mamma like his own.    \"But how can they have a mother where there isn't any for them?\"  Flossie asked, with a girl's queer way of reasoning.    \"I'll get them one,\" Freddie protested. \"I'll let Snoop be their mamma.\"    \"A cat! the idea! why, he would eat 'em all up,\" Flossie argued.    \"Not if I whipped him once for doing it,\" the brother insisted. Then  Nan and Bert began to tease him for whipping the kitten after the  chickens had been \"all eaten up.\"    So the merry days went on until at last vacation came!    \"Just one more night,\""]]]
