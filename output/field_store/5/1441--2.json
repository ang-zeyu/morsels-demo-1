THE KORAN:    COMMONLY CALLED THE    ALKORAN OF MOHAMMED.    Translated into English from the Original Arabic,    WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES TAKEN FROM THE MOST  APPROVED COMMENTATORS.    TO WHICH IS PREFIXED    A PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE,    BY GEORGE SALE.      TO THE  RIGHT HON. JOHN LORD CARTERET.    ONE OF THE LORDS OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL.        ____________       MY LORD,    NOTWITHSTANDING the great honour and respect generally and deservedly paid to  the memories of those who have founded states, or obliged a people by the  institution of laws which have made them prosperous and considerable in the  world, yet the legislator of the Arabs has been treated in so very different a  manner by all who acknowledge not his claim to a divine mission, and by  Christians especially, that were not your lordship's just discernment  sufficiently known, I should think myself under a necessity of making an  apology for presenting the following translation.       The remembrance of the calamities brought on so many nations by the  conquests of the Arabians may possibly raise some indignation against him who  formed them to empire; but this being equally applicable to all conquerors,  could not, of itself, occasion all the detestation with which the name of  Mohammed is loaded.  He has given a new system of religion, which has had  still greater success than the arms of his followers, and to establish this  religion made use of an imposture; and on this account it is supposed that he  must of necessity have been a most abandoned villain, and his memory is become  infamous.  But as Mohammed gave his Arabs the best religion he could, as well  as the best laws, preferable. at least, to those of the ancient pagan  lawgivers, I confess I cannot see why he deserves not equal respect-though not  with Moses or Jesus Christ, whose laws came really from Heaven, yet, with  Minos or Numa, notwithstanding the distinction of a learned writer, who seems  to think it a greater crime to make use of an imposture to set up a new  religion, founded on the acknowledgment of one true God, and to destroy  idolatry, than to use the same means to gain reception to rules and  regulations for the more orderly practice of heathenism already established.       To be acquainted with the various laws and constitutions of civilized  nations, especially of those who flourish in our own time, is, perhaps, the  most useful part of knowledge: wherein though your lordship, who shines with  so much distinction in the noblest assembly in the world, peculiarly excels;  yet as the law of Mohammed, by reason of the odium it lies under, and the  strangeness of the language in which it is written, has been so much  neglected.  I flatter myself some things in the following sheets may be new  even to a person of your lordship's extensive learning; and if what I have  written may be any way entertaining or acceptable to your lordship, I shall  not regret the pains it has cost me.       I join with the general voice in wishing your lordship all the honour and  happiness your known virtues and merit deserve, and am with perfect respect,         MY LORD,      Your lordship's most humble        And most obedient servant,          GEORGE SALE.      A SKETCH    OF THE    LIFE OF GEORGE SALE.      _________    OF the life of GEORGE SALE, a man of extensive learning, and considerable  literary talent, very few particulars have been transmitted to us by his  contemporaries.  He is said to have been born in the county of Kent, and the  time of his birth must have been not long previous to the close of the  seventeenth century.  His education he received at the King's School,  Canterbury.  Voltaire, who bestows high praise on the version of the Korân,  asserts him to have spent five-and-twenty years in Arabia, and to have  acquired in that country his profound knowledge of the Arabic language and  customs.  On what authority this is asserted it would now be fruitless to  endeavour to ascertain.  But that the assertion is an erroneous one, there can  be no reason to doubt; it being opposed by the stubborn evidence of dates and  facts.  It is almost certain that Sale was brought up to the law, and that he  practised it for many years, if not till the end of his career.  He is said,  by a co-existing writer, to have quitted his legal pursuits, for the purpose  of applying himself to the study of the eastern and other languages, both  ancient and modern.  His guide through the labyrinth of the oriental dialects  was Mr. Dadichi, the king's interpreter.  If it be true that he ever  relinquished the practice of the law, it would appear that he must have  resumed it before his decease; for, in his address to the reader, prefixed to  the Korân, he pleads, as an apology for the delay which had occurred in  publishing the volume, that the work \"was carried on at leisure times only,  and amidst the necessary avocations of a troublesome profession.\"  This alone  would suffice to show that Voltaire was in error.  But to this must be added,  that the existence of Sale was terminated at an early period, and that, in at  least his latter years, he was engaged in literary labours of no trifling  magnitude.  The story of his having, during a quarter of a century, resided in  Arabia, becomes, therefore, an obvious impossibility, and must be dismissed to  take its place among those fictions by which biography has often been  encumbered and disgraced.     Among the few productions of which Sale is known to be the author is a part  of \"The General Dictionary,\" in ten volumes, folio.  To the translation of  Bayle, which is incorporated with this voluminous work, he is stated to have  been a large contributor.     When the plan of the Universal History was arranged, Sale was one of those  who were selected to carry it into execution.  His coadjutors were Swinton,  eminent as an antiquary, and remarkable for absence of mind; Shelvocke,  originally a naval officer; the well informed, intelligent, and laborious  Campbell; that singular character, George Psalmanazar; and Archibald Bower,  who afterwards became an object of unenviable notoriety.  The portion of the  history which was supplied by Sale comprises \"The Introduction, containing the  Cosmogony, or Creation of the World;\" and the whole, or nearly the whole, of  the succeeding chapter, which traces the narrative of events from the creation  to the flood.  In the performance of his task, he displays a thorough  acquaintance with his subject; and his style, though not polished into  elegance, is neat and perspicuous.  In a French biographical dictionary, of  anti-liberal principles, a writer accuses him of having adopted a system  hostile to tradition and the Scriptures, and composed his account of the  Cosmogony with the view of giving currency to his heretical opinions.  Either  the accuser never read the article which he censures, or he has wilfully  misrepresented it; for it affords the fullest contradiction to the charge, as  does also the sequent chapter; and he must, therefore, be contented to choose  between the demerit of being a slanderer through blundering and reckless  ignorance, or through sheer malignity of heart.     Though his share in these publications affords proof of the erudition and  ability of Sale, it probably would not alone have been sufficient to preserve  his name from oblivion.  His claim to be remembered rests principally on his  version of the Korân, which appeared in November, 1734, in a quarto volume,  and was inscribed to Lord Carteret.  The dedicator does not disgrace himself  by descending to that fulsome adulatory style which was then too frequently  employed in addressing the great.  As a translator, he had the field almost  entirely to himself; there being at that time no English translation of the  Mohammedan civil and spiritual code, except a bad copy of the despicable one  by Du Ryer.  His performance was universally and justly approved of, still  still remains in repute, and is not likely to be superseded by any other of  the kind.  It may, perhaps, be regretted, that he did not preserve the  division into verses, as Savary has since done, instead of connecting them  into a continuous narrative.  Some of the poetical spirit is unavoidably lost  by the change.  But this is all that can be objected to him.  It is, I  believe, admitted, that he is in no common degree faithful to his original;  and his numerous notes, and Preliminary Discourse, manifest such a perfect  knowledge of Eastern habits, manners, traditions, and laws, as could have been  acquired only by an acute mind, capable of submitting to years of patient  toil.     But, though his work passed safely through the ordeal of criticism, it has  been made the pretext for a calumny against him.  It has been declared, that  he puts the Christian religion on the same footing with the Muhammedan; and  some charitable persons have even supposed him to have been a disguised  professor of the latter.  The origin of this slander we may trace back to the  strange obliquity of principles, and the blind merciless rage which are  characteristic of bigotry.  Sale was not one of those who imagine that the end  sanctifies the means, and that the best interests of mankind can be advanced  by violence, by railing, or by deviating form the laws of truth, in order to  blacken an adversary.  He enters into the consideration of the character of  Mohammed with a calm philosophic spirit; repeatedly censuring his imposture,  touching upon his subterfuges and inventions, but doing justice to him on  those points on which the pretended prophet is really worthy of praise.

The plan I have followed in this work has been to sift and arrange the  facts I have gathered concerning the habits of the animals best known to  me, preserving those only, which, in my judgment, appeared worth  recording. In some instances a variety of subjects have linked  themselves together in my mind, and have been grouped under one heading;  consequently the scope of the book is not indicated by the list of  contents: this want is, however, made good by an index at the end.    It is seldom an easy matter to give a suitable name to a book of this  description. I am conscious that the one I have made choice of displays  a lack of originality; also, that this kind of title has been used  hitherto for works constructed more or less on the plan of the famous  _Naturalist on the Amazons._ After I have made this apology the reader,  on his part, will readily admit that, in treating of the Natural History  of a district so well known, and often described as the southern portion  of La Plata, which has a temperate climate, and where nature is neither  exuberant nor grand, a personal narrative would have seemed superfluous.    The greater portion of the matter contained in this volume has already  seen the light in the form of papers contributed to the _Field,_ with  other journals that treat of Natural History; and to the monthly  magazines:--_Longmans', The Nineteenth Century, The Gentleman's  Magazine,_ and others: I am indebted to the Editors and Proprietors of  these periodicals for kindly allowing me to make use of this material.    Of all animals, birds have perhaps afforded me most pleasure; but most  of the fresh knowledge I have collected in this department is contained  in a larger work _(Argentine Ornithology),_ of which Dr. P. L. Sclater  is part author. As I have not gone over any of the subjects dealt with  in that work, bird-life has not received more than a fair share of  attention in the present volume.

During recent years we have heard much about the great and rapid changes  now going on in the plants and animals of all the temperate regions of  the globe colonized by Europeans. These changes, if taken merely as  evidence of material progress, must be a matter of rejoicing to those  who are satisfied, and more than satisfied, with our system of  civilization, or method of outwitting Nature by the removal of all  checks on the undue increase of our own species. To one who finds a  charm in things as they exist in the unconquered provinces of Nature's  dominions, and who, not being over-anxious to reach the end of his  journey, is content to perform it on horseback, or in a waggon drawn by  bullocks, it is permissible to lament the altered aspect of the earth's  surface, together with the disappearance of numberless noble and  beautiful forms, both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. For he  cannot find it in his heart to love the forms by which they are  replaced; these are cultivated and domesticated, and have only become  useful to man at the cost of that grace and spirit which freedom and  wildness give. In numbers they are many--twenty-five millions of sheep  in this district, fifty millions in that, a hundred millions in a  third--but how few are the species in place of those destroyed? and when  the owner of many sheep and much wheat desires variety--for he possesses  this instinctive desire, albeit in conflict with and overborne by the  perverted instinct of destruction--what is there left to him, beyond his  very own, except the weeds that spring up in his fields under all skies,  ringing him round with old-world monotonous forms, as tenacious of their  undesired union with him as the rats and cockroaches that inhabit his  house?    We hear most frequently of North America, New Zealand, and Australia in  this connection; but nowhere on the globe has civilization \"written  strange defeatures\" more markedly than on that great area of level  country called by English writers _the pampas_, but by the Spanish more  appropriately _La Pampa_--from the Quichua word signifying open space or  country--since it forms in most part one continuous plain, extending on  its eastern border from the river Parana, in latitude 32 degrees, to the  Patagonian formation on the river Colorado, and comprising about two  hundred thousand square miles of humid, grassy country.    This district has been colonized by Europeans since the middle of the  sixteenth century; but down to within a very few years ago immigration  was on too limited a scale to make any very great change; and, speaking  only of the pampean country, the conquered territory was a long,  thinly-settled strip, purely pastoral, and the Indians, with their  primitive mode of warfare, were able to keep back the invaders from the  greater portion of their ancestral hunting-grounds. Not twenty years  ago a ride of two hundred miles, starting from the capital city,  Buenos Ayres, was enough to place one well beyond the furthest  south-western frontier outpost. In 1879 the Argentine Government  determined to rid the country of the aborigines, or, at all events, to  break their hostile and predatory spirit once for all; with the result  that the entire area of the grassy pampas, with a great portion of  the sterile pampas and Patagonia, has been made available to the  emigrant. There is no longer anything to deter the starvelings  of the Old World from possessing themselves of this new land of  promise, flowing, like Australia, with milk and tallow, if not with  honey; any emasculated migrant from a Genoese or Neapolitan  slum is now competent to \"fight the wilderness\" out there, with his  eight-shilling fowling-piece and the implements of his trade. The  barbarians no longer exist to frighten his soul with dreadful war cries;  they have moved away to another more remote and shadowy region, called  in their own language _Alhuemapu_, and not known to geographers. For  the results so long and ardently wished for have swiftly followed on  General Roca's military expedition; and the changes witnessed during the  last decade on the pampas exceed in magnitude those which had been  previously effected by three centuries of occupation.    In view of this wave of change now rapidly sweeping away the old  order, with whatever beauty and grace it possessed, it might not seem  inopportune at the present moment to give a rapid sketch, from the field  naturalist's point of view, of the great plain, as it existed before the  agencies introduced by European colonists had done their work, and as it  still exists in its remoter parts.    The humid, grassy, pampean country extends, roughly speaking, half-way  from the Atlantic Ocean and the Plata and Parana rivers to the Andes,  and passes gradually into the \"Monte Formation,\" or _sterile pampa_--a  sandy, more or less barren district, producing a dry, harsh, ligneous  vegetation, principally thorny bushes and low trees, of which the chanar  (Gurliaca decorticans) is the most common; hence the name of  \"Chanar-steppe\" used by some writers: and this formation extends  southwards down into Patagonia. Scientists have not yet been able to  explain why the pampas, with a humid climate, and a soil exceedingly  rich, have produced nothing but grass, while the dry, sterile  territories on their north, west, and south borders have an arborescent  vegetation. Darwin's conjecture that the extreme violence of the  _pampero,_ or south-west wind, prevented trees from growing, is now  proved to have been ill-founded since the introduction of the Eucalyptus  globulus; for this noble tree attains to an extraordinary height on the  pampas, and exhibits there a luxuriance of foliage never seen in  Australia.    To this level area--my \"parish of Selborne,\" or, at all events, a goodly  portion of it--with the sea on one hand, and on the other the  practically infinite expanse of grassy desert--another sea, not \"in vast  fluctuations fixed,\" but in comparative calm--I should like to conduct  the reader in imagination: a country all the easier to be imagined on  account of the absence of mountains, woods, lakes, and rivers. There is,  indeed, little to be imagined--not even a sense of vastness; and Darwin,  touching on this point, in the _Journal of a Naturalist,_ aptly  says:--\"At sea, a person's eye being six feet above the surface of the  water, his horizon is two miles and four-fifths distant. In like manner,  the more level the plain, the more nearly does the horizon approach  within these narrow limits; and this, in my opinion, entirely destroys  the grandeur which one would have imagined that a vast plain would have  possessed.\"    I remember my first experience of a hill,"]]]
