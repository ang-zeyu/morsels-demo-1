Dorothy's Magic Belt          Author's Note      My friends the children are responsible for this new \"Oz Book,\" as they  were for the last one, which was called The Land of Oz.  Their sweet  little letters plead to know \"more about Dorothy\"; and they ask: \"What  became of the Cowardly Lion?\" and \"What did Ozma do  afterward?\"--meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of Oz.  And  some of them suggest plots to me, saying: \"Please have Dorothy go to  the Land of Oz again\"; or, \"Why don't you make Ozma and Dorothy meet,  and have a good time together?\"  Indeed, could I do all that my little  friends ask, I would be obliged to write dozens of books to satisfy  their demands.  And I wish I could, for I enjoy writing these stories  just as much as the children say they enjoy reading them.    Well, here is \"more about Dorothy,\" and about our old friends the  Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and Ozma,  and all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal about some  new folks that are queer and unusual.  One little friend, who read this  story before it was printed, said to me: \"Billina is REAL OZZY, Mr.  Baum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger.\"    If this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks find  this new story \"real Ozzy,\" I shall be very glad indeed that I wrote  it.  But perhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome letters  from my readers, telling me just how they like \"Ozma of Oz.\"  I hope  so, anyway.      L. FRANK BAUM.    MACATAWA, 1907.          1.  The Girl in the Chicken Coop      The wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean, sending ripples  across its surface.  Then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples  until they became waves, and shoved the waves around until they became  billows.  The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher even than the tops  of houses.  Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall  trees, and seemed like mountains; and the gulfs between the great  billows were like deep valleys.    All this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean,  which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever,  resulted in a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut  many queer pranks and do a lot of damage.    At the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the  waters.  When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and  bigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise--first one way  and then the other--and was jostled around so roughly that even the  sailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep  themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into  the sea.    And the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn't get  through them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the  terrors of the storm.    The Captain of the ship was not afraid, because he had seen storms  before, and had sailed his ship through them in safety; but he knew  that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck,  so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until  after the storm was over, and to keep brave hearts and not be scared,  and all would be well with them.    Now, among these passengers was a little Kansas girl named Dorothy  Gale, who was going with her Uncle Henry to Australia, to visit some  relatives they had never before seen.  Uncle Henry, you must know, was  not very well, because he had been working so hard on his Kansas farm  that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous.  So he  left Aunt Em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of  the farm, while he traveled far away to Australia to visit his cousins  and have a good rest.    Dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey, and Uncle Henry  thought she would be good company and help cheer him up; so he decided  to take her along.  The little girl was quite an experienced traveller,  for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the  marvelous Land of Oz, and she had met with a good many adventures in  that strange country before she managed to get back to Kansas again.  So she wasn't easily frightened, whatever happened, and when the wind  began to howl and whistle, and the waves began to tumble and toss, our  little girl didn't mind the uproar the least bit.    \"Of course we'll have to stay in the cabin,\" she said to Uncle Henry  and the other passengers, \"and keep as quiet as possible until the  storm is over.  For the Captain says if we go on deck we may be blown  overboard.\"    No one wanted to risk such an accident as that, you may be sure; so all  the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin, listening to the  shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and  trying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped  sidewise.    Dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to  find that Uncle Henry was missing.  She couldn't imagine where he had  gone, and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him, and  to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck.  In that case  he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again.    The fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little  sleeping-berth, but Dorothy did not know that.  She only remembered  that Aunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle, so at  once she decided to go on deck and find him, in spite of the fact that  the tempest was now worse than ever, and the ship was plunging in a  really dreadful manner.  Indeed, the little girl found it was as much  as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck, and as soon as she got  there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the  skirts of her dress.  Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in  defying the storm, and while she held fast to the railing she peered  around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man  clinging to a mast not far away from her.  This might be her uncle, so  she called as loudly as she could:    \"Uncle Henry!  Uncle Henry!\"    But the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her  own voice, and the man certainly failed to hear her, for he did not  move.    Dorothy decided she must go to him; so she made a dash forward, during  a lull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed  to the deck with ropes.  She reached this place in safety, but no  sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which  the chickens were kept than the wind, as if enraged because the little  girl dared to resist its power, suddenly redoubled its fury.  With a  scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the  coop and lifted it high into the air, with Dorothy still clinging to  the slats.  Around and over it whirled, this way and that, and a few  moments later the chicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the  big waves caught it and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then  down-hill into a deep valley, as if it were nothing more than a  plaything to keep them amused.    Dorothy had a good ducking, you may be sure, but she didn't lose her  presence of mind even for a second.  She kept tight hold of the stout  slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw  that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop, and the poor chickens  were fluttering away in every direction, being blown by the wind until  they looked like feather dusters without handles.  The bottom of the  coop was made of thick boards, so Dorothy found she was clinging to a  sort of raft, with sides of slats, which readily bore up her weight.  After coughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath  again, she managed to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm  wooden bottom of the coop, which supported her easily enough.    \"Why, I've got a ship of my own!\" she thought, more amused than  frightened at her sudden change of condition; and then, as the coop  climbed up to the top of a big wave, she looked eagerly around for the  ship from which she had been blown.    It was far, far away, by this time.  Perhaps no one on board had yet  missed her, or knew of her strange adventure.  Down into a valley  between the waves the coop swept her, and when she climbed another  crest the ship looked like a toy boat, it was such a long way off.  Soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom, and then Dorothy gave a  sigh of regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began to wonder what was  going to happen to her next.    Just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean, with nothing to  keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had a plank bottom  and slatted sides, through which the water constantly splashed and  wetted her through to the skin!

The period of limited offensives, bypassing, and island hopping  was virtually over. American troops in greater numbers than ever  before assembled in the Pacific Theater, supported by naval and air  forces of corresponding size, fought and overcame Japanese forces of  greater magnitude than any previously met.    Though the spotlight is on the front-line fighting, the reader will  find in this volume a faithful description of all arms and services  performing their missions. The account is not exclusively an infantry  story. It covers as well the support of ground fighting on Leyte by  large-scale naval operations and by land-based air power under the  most adverse conditions. In addition, careful attention to logistical  matters, such as the movement of supplies and the evacuation of the  wounded, gives the reader a picture of the less spectacular activities  of an army in battle.      ORLANDO WARD  Maj. Gen., U. S. A.  Chief of Military History    Washington, D. C.  30 January 1953                  THE AUTHOR      M. Hamlin Cannon received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History  from the American University of Washington, D.C.  He is already  known to American historians for his writings on Mormon and Civil  War history which have appeared in historical journals.  During World  War II he served with the Navy in Australia and New Guinea.                  PREFACE      The landing of the American forces on Leyte on 20 October 1944 brought  to fruition the long-cherished desire of General Douglas MacArthur to  return to the Philippine Islands and avenge the humiliating reverses  suffered in the early days of World War II. The successful conclusion  of the campaign separated the Japanese-held Philippine Archipelago  into two parts, with a strong American force between them. More  important, it completed the severance of the Japanese mainland from  the stolen southern empire in the Netherlands Indies from which oil,  the lifeblood of modern warfare, had come.    The Leyte Campaign, like other campaigns in the Pacific, was  waged on the land, in the air, and on and under the sea. In this  operation all branches of the American armed forces played significant  roles. Therefore, although the emphasis in this volume is placed upon  the deeds of the United States Army ground soldier, the endeavors  of the aviator, the sailor, the marine and the Filipino guerrilla  have been integrated as far as possible into the story in order to  make the campaign understandable in its entirety. At the same time,  every effort has been made to give the Japanese side of the story.    Obviously, to include every exploit of every branch of the armed  forces, of the Filipinos, and of the Japanese would be far beyond  the compass of a single volume. A careful selectivity was necessary  throughout in order to avoid the Scylla of omission while skirting  the Charybdis of oversimplification. Despite these precautions,  because of the nature of the available documentary evidence, I may  have unwittingly fallen into some of the very pitfalls that I tried  to avoid.        I wish to express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the many people  who have given fully of their time and talents in the preparation of  this volume.    Especial thanks are due to Dr. John Miller, jr., who, during his tenure  as Chief of the Pacific Section, Office of the Chief of Military  History, carefully reviewed the final draft of the manuscript. His  sound advice and constructive criticism eliminated many a roadblock. I  wish, also, to thank Dr. Louis Morton, Chief of the Pacific Section,  under whose direction this volume was started; he made constructive  criticism of several of the chapters. Dr. Kent Roberts Greenfield,  Chief Historian, Department of the Army, devoted much time and effort  to reviewing the manuscript and his many penetrating comments on the  various chapters were invaluable.    Appreciation is due to the people of the Historical Records Section,  Departmental Records Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, who  helped to locate source material and furnished working space for me  and the records. To Mrs. Lois Aldridge, Mrs. Frances Bowen, Mrs. Clyde  Christian, Miss Margaret Emerson, Mrs. Ellen Garrison, Mr. Robert  Greathouse, Miss Matilda Huber, Mrs. Margarite Kerstetter, Mr. Wilbur  Nigh, Miss Sue D. Wallace, and Miss Thelma K. Yarborough--thanks.    I wish also to thank the members of the U. S. Air Force Historical  Division, Air University, and the Naval History Branch, Naval Records  and History Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, for  placing at my disposal the pertinent air and naval records.    Thanks are also due to the members of the historical sections of the  U. S. Navy and the U. S. Air Force and to the many participating  commanders of various branches of the U. S. armed forces who read  all or parts of the manuscript.    The late W. Brooks Phillips started the editing of the manuscript. He  was succeeded by Col. B. A. Day, Chief of the Editorial and Publication  Division, and Mrs. Loretto Stevens. Mrs. Stevens also prepared the  final copy for the printer. Miss Mary Ann Bacon prepared the index.    Mrs. Martha Willoughby, in addition to accomplishing the arduous  task of interpreting my handwriting, typed many of the drafts of the  manuscript and saw that the subject and predicate agreed. Mrs. Wynona  Hayden, Mrs. Stella Hess, and Mrs. Michael Miller also typed parts  of the manuscript. Miss Elizabeth Armstrong painstakingly typed the  final copy.    Mr. Wsevolod Aglaimoff and Lt. Col. Robert F. O'Donnell, as well as  other members of the Cartographic Branch, spent many months in research  for and preparation of the maps. At the time this volume was being  prepared for publication, no reliable maps of Leyte were available. The  maps for this volume are based on the highly inaccurate maps used by  the troops during the operation. The relief in particular, as shown  on these maps, has little in common with the terrain configuration  which confronted the troops. Thus, both military and geographical  information as given on the maps in the volume should be regarded only  as an approximation of the actual situation at the time of the battle.    Major Arthur T. Lawry selected and edited the photographs used in this  volume. Lt. Roger Pineau (USNR) furnished me the photograph of General  Suzuki. Mr. Israel Wice and his capable"]]]
