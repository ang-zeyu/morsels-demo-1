BOILEAU.      In reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals, they  have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of excitement  and recklessness, when they care not what they do. We find that whole  communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its  pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with  one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some  new folly more captivating than the first. We see one nation suddenly  seized, from its highest to its lowest members, with a fierce desire  of military glory; another as suddenly becoming crazed upon a religious  scruple, and neither of them recovering its senses until it has shed  rivers of blood and sowed a harvest of groans and tears, to be reaped  by its posterity. At an early age in the annals of Europe its population  lost their wits about the Sepulchre of Jesus, and crowded in frenzied  multitudes to the Holy Land: another age went mad for fear of the Devil,  and offered up hundreds of thousands of victims to the delusion of  witchcraft. At another time, the many became crazed on the subject of  the Philosopher's Stone, and committed follies till then unheard of in  the pursuit. It was once thought a venial offence in very many countries  of Europe to destroy an enemy by slow poison. Persons who would have  revolted at the idea of stabbing a man to the heart, drugged his pottage  without scruple. Ladies of gentle birth and manners caught the  contagion of murder, until poisoning, under their auspices, became quite  fashionable. Some delusions, though notorious to all the world, have  subsisted for ages, flourishing as widely among civilized and polished  nations as among the early barbarians with whom they originated,--that  of duelling, for instance, and the belief in omens and divination of  the future, which seem to defy the progress of knowledge to eradicate  entirely from the popular mind. Money, again, has often been a cause  of the delusion of multitudes. Sober nations have all at once become  desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of  a piece of paper. To trace the history of the most prominent of these  delusions is the object of the present pages. Men, it has been well  said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while  they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.    In the present state of civilization, society has often shown itself  very prone to run a career of folly from the last-mentioned cases.  This infatuation has seized upon whole nations in a most extraordinary  manner. France, with her Mississippi madness, set the first great  example, and was very soon imitated by England with her South Sea  Bubble. At an earlier period, Holland made herself still more ridiculous  in the eyes of the world, by the frenzy which came over her people for  the love of Tulips. Melancholy as all these delusions were in their  ultimate results, their history is most amusing. A more ludicrous and  yet painful spectacle, than that which Holland presented in the years  1635 and 1636, or France in 1719 and 1720, can hardly be imagined.  Taking them in the order of their importance, we shall commence our  history with John Law and the famous Mississippi scheme of the years  above mentioned.          THE MISSISSIPPI SCHEME         Some in clandestine companies combine;       Erect new stocks to trade beyond the line;       With air and empty names beguile the town,       And raise new credits first, then cry 'em down;       Divide the empty nothing into shares,       And set the crowd together by the ears.         Defoe.      The personal character and career of one man are so intimately connected  with the great scheme of the years 1719 and 1720, that a history of the  Mississippi madness can have no fitter introduction than a sketch of the  life of its great author, John Law. Historians are divided in opinion as  to whether they should designate him a knave or a madman. Both epithets  were unsparingly applied to him in his lifetime, and while the unhappy  consequences of his projects were still deeply felt. Posterity, however,  has found reason to doubt the justice of the accusation, and to confess  that John Law was neither knave nor madman, but one more deceived  than deceiving; more sinned against than sinning. He was thoroughly  acquainted with the philosophy and true principles of credit. He  understood the monetary question better than any man of his day; and if  his system fell with a crash so tremendous, it was not so much his  fault as that of the people amongst whom he had erected it. He did not  calculate upon the avaricious frenzy of a whole nation; he did not see  that confidence, like mistrust, could be increased, almost ad infinitum,  and that hope was as extravagant as fear. How was he to foretell that  the French people, like the man in the fable, would kill, in their  frantic eagerness, the fine goose he had brought to lay them so many  golden eggs? His fate was like that which may be supposed to have  overtaken the first adventurous boatman who rowed from Erie to Ontario.  Broad and smooth was the river on which he embarked; rapid and pleasant  was his progress; and who was to stay him in his career? Alas for him!  the cataract was nigh. He saw, when it was too late, that the tide which  wafted him so joyously along was a tide of destruction; and when he  endeavoured to retrace his way, he found that the current was too strong  for his weak efforts to stem, and that he drew nearer every instant to  the tremendous falls. Down he went over the sharp rocks, and the  waters with him. He was dashed to pieces with his bark, but the waters,  maddened and turned to foam by the rough descent, only boiled and  bubbled for a time, and then flowed on again as smoothly as ever. Just  so it was with Law and the French people. He was the boatman and they  were the waters.    John Law was born at Edinburgh in the year 1671. His father was the  younger son of an ancient family in Fife, and carried on the business  of a goldsmith and banker. He amassed considerable wealth in his trade,  sufficient to enable him to gratify the wish, so common among his  countrymen, of adding a territorial designation to his name. He  purchased with this view the estates of Lauriston and Randleston, on  the Frith of Forth on the borders of West and Mid Lothian, and was  thenceforth known as Law of Lauriston. The subject of our memoir, being  the eldest son, was received into his father's counting-house at the  age of fourteen, and for three years laboured hard to acquire an insight  into the principles of banking, as then carried on in Scotland. He  had always manifested great love for the study of numbers, and his  proficiency in the mathematics was considered extraordinary in one of  his tender years. At the age of seventeen he was tall, strong, and well  made; and his face, although deeply scarred with the small-pox, was  agreeable in its expression, and full of intelligence. At this time he  began to neglect his business, and becoming vain of his person, indulged  in considerable extravagance of attire. He was a great favourite  with the ladies, by whom he was called Beau Law, while the other sex,  despising his foppery, nicknamed him Jessamy John. At the death of his  father, which happened in 1688, he withdrew entirely from the desk,  which had become so irksome, and being possessed of the revenues of the  paternal estate of Lauriston, he proceeded to London, to see the world.    He was now very young, very vain, good-looking, tolerably rich, and  quite uncontrolled. It is no wonder that, on his arrival in the capital,  he should launch out into extravagance. He soon became a regular  frequenter of the gaming-houses, and by pursuing a certain plan,  based upon some abstruse calculation of chances, he contrived to gain  considerable sums. All the gamblers envied him his luck, and many made  it a point to watch his play, and stake their money on the same chances.  In affairs of gallantry he was equally fortunate; ladies of the first  rank smiled graciously upon the handsome Scotchman--the young, the rich,  the witty, and the obliging. But all these successes only paved the way  for reverses. After he had been for nine years exposed to the dangerous  attractions of the gay life he was leading, he became an irrecoverable  gambler. As his love of play increased in violence, it diminished  in prudence. Great losses were only to be repaired by still greater  ventures, and one unhappy day he lost more than he could repay without  mortgaging his family estate. To that step he was driven at last. At  the same time his gallantry brought him into trouble. A love affair, or  slight flirtation, with a lady of the name of Villiers [Miss Elizabeth  Villiers, afterwards Countess of Orkney] exposed him to the resentment  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#1)"],[1,"WING    By Sax Rohmer          [Illustration: \"_When the woman raised her arms in a peculiar fashion,  the shadow on the blind was remarkably like that of a bat_\"]          CONTENTS        CHAPTER     I.

AN AFTERWORD          CHAPTER I    PAUL HARLEY OF CHANCERY LANE        Toward the hour of six on a hot summer's evening Mr. Paul Harley was  seated in his private office in Chancery Lane reading through a number  of letters which Innes, his secretary, had placed before him for  signature. Only one more remained to be passed, but it was a long,  confidential report upon a certain matter, which Harley had prepared for  His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.  He glanced with a sigh of weariness at the little clock upon his table  before commencing to read.    \"Shall detain you only a few minutes, now, Knox,\" he said.    I nodded, smiling. I was quite content to sit and watch my friend at  work.    Paul Harley occupied a unique place in the maelstrom of vice and  ambition which is sometimes called London life. Whilst at present he  held no official post, some of the most momentous problems of British  policy during the past five years, problems imperilling inter-state  relationships and not infrequently threatening a renewal of the world  war, had owed their solution to the peculiar genius of this man.    No clue to his profession appeared upon the plain brass plate attached  to his door, and little did those who regarded Paul Harley merely as a  successful private detective suspect that he was in the confidence  of some who guided the destinies of the Empire. Paul Harley's work in  Constantinople during the feverish months preceding hostilities with  Turkey, although unknown to the general public, had been of a  most extraordinary nature. His recommendations were never adopted,  unfortunately. Otherwise, the tragedy of the Dardanelles might have been  averted.    His surroundings as he sat there, gaze bent upon the typewritten pages,  were those of any other professional man. So it would have seemed to the  casual observer. But perhaps there was a quality in the atmosphere of  the office which would have told a more sensitive visitor that it was  the apartment of no ordinary man of business. Whilst there were filing  cabinets and bookshelves laden with works of reference, many of them  legal, a large and handsome Burmese cabinet struck an unexpected note.    On closer inspection, other splashes of significant colour must have  been detected in the scheme, notably a very fine engraving of Edgar  Allan Poe, from the daguerreotype of 1848; and upon the man himself lay  the indelible mark of the tropics. His clean-cut features had that hint  of underlying bronze which tells of years spent beneath a merciless sun,  and the touch of gray at his temples only added to the eager, almost  fierce vitality of the dark face. Paul Harley was notable because of  that intellectual strength which does not strike one immediately,  since it is purely temperamental, but which, nevertheless, invests its  possessor with an aura of distinction.    Writing his name at the bottom of the report, Paul Harley enclosed the  pages in a long envelope and dropped the envelope into a basket which  contained a number of other letters. His work for the day was ended, and  glancing at me with a triumphant smile, he stood up. His office was a  part of a residential suite, but although, like some old-time burgher of  the city, he lived on the premises, the shutting of a door which led to  his private rooms marked the close of the business day. Pressing a bell  which connected with the public office occupied by his secretary, Paul  Harley stood up as Innes entered.    \"There's nothing further, is there, Innes?\" he asked.    \"Nothing, Mr. Harley, if you have passed the Home Office report?\"    Paul Harley laughed shortly.    \"There it is,\" he replied, pointing to the basket; \"a tedious and  thankless job, Innes. It is the fifth draft you have prepared and it  will have to do.\"    He took up a letter which lay unsealed upon the table. \"This is the  Rokeby affair,\" he said. \"I have decided to hold it over, after all,  until my return.\"    \"Ah!\" said Innes, quietly glancing at each envelope as he took it from  the basket. \"I see you have turned down the little job offered by the  Marquis.\"    \"I have,\" replied Harley, smiling grimly, \"and a fee of five hundred  guineas with it. I have also intimated to that distressed nobleman that  this is a business office and that a laundry is the proper place to take  his dirty linen. No, there's nothing further to-night, Innes. You can  get along now. Has Miss Smith gone?\"    But as if in answer to his enquiry the typist, who with Innes made up  the entire staff of the office, came in at that moment, a card in her  hand. Harley glanced across in my direction and then at the card, with a  wry expression.    \"Colonel Juan Menendez,\" he read aloud, \"Cavendish Club,\" and glanced  reflectively at Innes. \"Do we know the Colonel?\"    \"I think not,\" answered Innes; \"the name is unfamiliar to me.\"    \"I wonder,\" murmured Harley. He glanced across at me. \"It's an awful  nuisance, Knox, but just as I thought the decks were clear. Is it  something really interesting, or does he want a woman watched? However,  his name sounds piquant, so perhaps I had better see him. Ask him to  come in, Miss Smith.\"    Innes and Miss Smith retiring, there presently entered a man of most  striking and unusual presence. In the first place, Colonel Menendez must  have stood fully six feet in his boots, and he carried himself like a  grandee of the golden days of Spain. His complexion was extraordinarily  dusky, whilst his hair, which was close cropped, was iron gray. His  heavy eyebrows and curling moustache with its little points were equally  black, so that his large teeth gleamed very fiercely when he smiled. His  eyes were large, dark, and brilliant, and although he wore an admirably  cut tweed suit, for some reason I pictured him as habitually wearing  riding kit. Indeed I almost seemed to hear the jingle of his spurs.    He carried an ebony cane for which I mentally substituted a crop, and  his black derby hat I thought hardly as suitable as a sombrero. His age  might have been anything between fifty and fifty-five.    Standing in the doorway he bowed, and if his smile was Mephistophelean,  there was much about Colonel Juan Menendez which commanded respect.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he began, and his high, thin voice afforded yet  another surprise, \"I feel somewhat ill at ease to--how do you say  it?--appropriate your time, as I am by no means sure that what I have to  say justifies my doing so.\"    He spoke most fluent, indeed florid, English. But his sentences at times  were oddly constructed; yet, save for a faint accent, and his frequent  interpolation of such expressions as \"how do you say?\"--a sort of  nervous mannerism--one might have supposed him to be a Britisher who had  lived much abroad. I formed the opinion that he had read extensively,  and this, as I learned later, was indeed the case.    \"Sit down, Colonel Menendez,\" said Harley with quiet geniality.  \"Officially, my working day is ended, I admit, but if you have no  objection to the presence of my friend, Mr. Knox, I shall be most happy  to chat with you.\"    He smiled in a way all his own.    \"If your business is of a painfully professional nature,\" he added,  \"I must beg you to excuse me for fourteen days, as I am taking a badly  needed holiday with my friend.\"    \"Ah, is it so?\" replied the Colonel, placing his hat and cane upon the  table, and sitting down rather wearily in a big leathern armchair which  Harley had pushed forward. \"If I intrude I am sorry, but indeed my  business is urgent, and I come to you on the recommendation of my  friend, Senor Don Merry del Val, the Spanish Ambassador.\"    He raised his eyes to Harley's face with an expression of peculiar  appeal. I rose to depart, but:    \"Sit down, Knox,\" said Harley, and turned again to the visitor. \"Please  proceed,\" he requested. \"Mr. Knox has been with me in some of the most  delicate cases which I have ever handled, and you may rely upon his  discretion as you may rely upon mine.\" He pushed forward a box of  cigars. \"Will you smoke?\"    \"Thanks, no,\" was the answer; \"you see, I rarely smoke anything but my  cigarettes.\"    Colonel Menendez extracted a slip of rice paper from a little packet  which he carried, next, dipping two long, yellow fingers into his coat  pocket, he brought out a portion of tobacco, laid it in the paper, and  almost in the twinkling of an eye had made, rolled, and lighted a very  creditable cigarette. His dexterity was astonishing, and seeing my  surprise he raised his heavy eyebrows, and:    \"Practice makes perfect, is it not said?\" he remarked.    He shrugged his shoulders and dropped the extinguished match in an ash  tray, whilst I studied him with increasing interest. Some dread, real or  imaginary, was oppressing "]]]
