I am sorry to find that in transcribing I have wandered away from  Mr. Endle's system of marking the values of the vowels. But the  differences are, in essence, very small.    The circumflex accent indicates a long vowel.    \"å\" is as in Mr. Endle's Grammar.    \"ù\" is the guttural \"u\" printed in Mr. Endle's Grammar as \"u.\"      J. D. A.                  PREFACE.      This little collection of Kachári folk-stories and rhymes is intended  as a supplement to the Reverend Mr. Endle's Grammar of the language,  and as a reading-book for those who have acquired an elementary  knowledge of Kachári. I have added a rough translation, thinking  that these specimens of the folk-lore of a very simple and primitive  people may be of interest to some who do not care to learn Kachári,  and that it may stimulate others to make fuller and more successful  excursions into an unexplored field. These stories were collected  during a tour of only six weeks' duration in the Kachári mauzas of  Mangaldai, and cost only the effort of taking down the tales as they  were dictated. Not only the Kacháris, but the other hill tribes of  Assam have doubtless their stores of folk legends which have never  been exploited; and it pleases me to hope that others may find it  as pleasant as I have found it, to collect these fictions of the  savage mind over the camp fire. The text of the stories suggests a  problem which it may amuse some one with better opportunities or more  perseverance than myself to solve. It will be noticed that while the  words are for the most part Kachári words, the syntax is curiously  like the Assamese syntax. As an instance of this I have taken down  (see page 1) an accused person's statement in both Assamese and  Kachári. The Kachári version is, literally, a word-for-word translation  of the Assamese. I can think of no other two languages in which it  would be possible to translate a long statement word for word out  of one into the other and yet be idiomatic. The most characteristic  idioms are exactly reproduced. The Assamese says mor bapáy, but tor  báper. The Kachári similarly says Ângnî âfâ, but nangnî namfâ. The  Assamese says e dâl láthi; the Kachári translates gongse lauthi. The  Assamese says gai-pelay kalon; the Kachári khithâ-hùi-man. And many  more instances will occur to any one with a knowledge of Assamese  who reads these stories. Briefly, it may be said that Kachári,  as it is spoken in Darrang, has a vocabulary mostly of the Bodo  type, though it contains many words borrowed from the Assamese. Its  syntax, on the other hand, is nearly identical with the Assamese,  almost the only exception being the use of the agglutinate verb  (see page 26 of Mr. Endle's Grammar). Even the agglutinate verb is  more or less reproduced in Assamese in the use of such expressions  as gai pelay. Now it is quite possible that the Kacháris, from long  association with their Hindu neighbours, have learnt their syntax,  while retaining their own vocabulary. A more tempting theory is that  Assamese and Kachári are both survivals of the vanished speech of the  great Koch race, who, we know, ruled where Assamese and Kachári are  now spoken side by side; that Assamese has retained the Koch syntax,  while it has adopted the Hindu vocabulary of Bengal; that Kachári  has preserved both vocabulary and syntax. This theory, if it can be  defended, would at last give Assamese a valid claim to be considered  a separate tongue, and not a mere dialect of Bengali. It would also  give an explanation of the vexed question of the origin of the word  Kachári. Ârúi is a common patronymic in the Kachári speech. As Mr. Gait  has noted in his Census Report, the Kacháris have totemistic clans,  calling themselves Bâg-ârùi, sons of the tiger, and so on. What more  simple than that the Koch-ârùi are the sons of the Koches? So far,  the problem is one of mere guesswork and theory. But there are other  branches of the Bodo tongue in the Tipperah and Gáro Hills and in  North Cachar, where men of the Bodo race do not come into contact with  Assamese. Do the same idioms and the same syntax exist there? If not,  they were probably borrowed from Hindu sources. If they do, it seems  probable that these idioms and this syntax have survived not only in  them, but in the Hinduised Assamese.    I had intended to draw up a list of the agglutinate verbs found in  this little collection of stories to supplement that given at page  26 of Mr. Endle's Grammar. But anyone interested in the subject will  find them for himself in the stories, and will learn more easily  from the context than from any vocabulary what the precise shades of  meaning of the interpolated particles are. They are a very curious and  interesting feature of the language, and are probably found in richer  abundance where the well of Bodo undefiled has not been contaminated  by a mixture with other tongues.    I must not conclude without offering my hearty thanks to the Reverend  Mr. Endle for his advice and help in collecting these stories, and  to Samson, my tutor, who was in truth \"the only begetter of these  ensuing\" fictions. He told me most of them and corrected all. I have  no doubt he has many other primitive legends, if any one will take  the trouble to write them down.      J. D. ANDERSON.    The 21st September 1894.            P.S.--There can be no doubt that the Kachári of Darrang is greatly  influenced by the surrounding Assamese, though, even now, many  Kacháris, and especially women, do not speak Assamese at all. There  is an anecdote among the Kacháris showing the inconveniences of the  bilingual state. A Kachári lad married an Assamese girl, and going to  his mother-in-law's house was given food. His hospitable mother-in-law  cried to him \"Khâ! Khâ!\" so he bound her hand and foot. Then she  laughed, seeing that he supposed her to be talking Kachári. So she  said to him (in Kachári) \"Zâ! Zâ!\" on which he went away. I am afraid  the Kachári syntax is borrowed from Assamese.                  KACHÁRI FOLK-TALES AND RHYMES.

In the case of great statesmen there is a third consideration which  challenges our judgment--what they choose to do. This consideration only  presents itself in the case of great statesmen, and even then is not  always recognised. For the average statesman does from day to day the  business which has to be done, takes affairs as he finds them, and makes  the best of them. Many who deliberately selected the questions with  which they dealt have yet shrunk from the responsibility of their  choice, and have preferred to represent their actions as inevitable. Few  can claim the credit of choosing the sphere of their activity, of  framing a connected policy with clear and definite ends, and of applying  their ideas to every department of national organisation. In short,  statesmen are generally opportunists, or choose to represent themselves  as such; and this has been especially the case with English  statesmen--amongst whom Wolsey stands out as a notable exception. For  Wolsey claims recognition on grounds which apply to himself alone. His  name is not associated with any great achievement, he worked out no  great measure of reform, nor did he contribute any great political idea  which was fruitful in after days. He was, above all things, a practical  man, though he pursued a line of policy which few understood, and which  he did not stop to make intelligible. No very definite results came of  it immediately, and the results which came of it afterwards were not  such as Wolsey had designed. Yet, if we consider his actual  achievements, we are bound to admit that he was probably the greatest  political genius whom England has ever produced; for at a great crisis  of European history he impressed England with a sense of her own  importance, and secured for her a leading position in European affairs,  which since his days has seemed her natural right.    Thus Wolsey is to be estimated by what he chose to do rather than by  what he did. He was greater than his achievements. Yet Wolsey's  greatness did not rise beyond the conditions of his own age, and he left  no legacy of great thought or high endeavour. The age in which he lived  was not one of lofty aspirations or noble aims; but it was one of large  designs and restless energy. No designs were cast in so large a mould as  were those of Wolsey; no statesman showed such skill as he did in  weaving patiently the web of diplomatic intrigue. His resources were  small, and he husbanded them with care. He had a master who only dimly  understood his objects, and whose personal whims and caprices had always  to be conciliated. He was ill supplied with agents. His schemes often  failed in detail; but he was always ready to gather together the broken  threads and resume his work without repining. In a time of universal  restlessness and excitement Wolsey was the most plodding, the most  laborious, and the most versatile of those who laboured at statecraft.    The field of action which Wolsey deliberately chose was that of foreign  policy, and his weapons were diplomacy. The Englishmen of his time were  like the Englishmen of to-day, and had little sympathy with his objects.  Those who reaped the benefits of his policy gave him no thanks for it,  nor did they recognise what they owed to him. Those who exulted in the  course taken by the English Reformation regarded Wolsey as its bitterest  foe, and never stopped to think that Wolsey trained the hands and brains  which directed it; that Wolsey inspired England with the proud feeling  of independence which nerved her to brave the public opinion of Europe;  that Wolsey impressed Europe with such a sense of England's greatness  that she was allowed to go her own way, menaced but unassailed. The  spirit which animated the England of the sixteenth century was due in no  small degree to the splendour of Wolsey's successes, and to the way in  which he stamped upon men's imagination a belief in England's greatness.  If it is the characteristic of a patriot to believe that nothing is  beyond the power of his country to achieve, then Wolsey was the most  devoted patriot whom England ever produced.    When Wolsey came to power England was an upstart trying to claim for  herself a decent position in the august society of European states. It  was Wolsey's cleverness that set her in a place far above that which she  had any right to expect. For this purpose Wolsey schemed and intrigued;  when one plan failed he was always ready with another. It mattered  little what was the immediate object which he had in hand; it mattered  much that in pursuing it he should so act as to increase the credit of  England, and create a belief in England's power. Diplomacy can reckon  few abler practitioners than was Wolsey.    There is little that is directly ennobling in the contemplation of such  a career. It may be doubted if the career of any practical statesman can  be a really ennobling study if we have all its activity recorded in  detail. At the best it tells us of much which seems disingenuous if not  dishonest--much in which nobility of aim or the complexity of affairs  has to be urged in extenuation of shifty words and ambiguous actions.    The age in which Wolsey lived was immoral in the sense in which all  periods are immoral, when the old landmarks are disappearing and there  is no certainty about the future. Morality in individuals and in states  alike requires an orderly life, a perception of limits, a pursuit of  definite ends. When order is shattered, when limits are removed, when  all things seem possible, then political morality disappears. In such a  condition was Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The old  ideas, on which the mediæval conception of Christendom depended, were  passing away. No one any longer regarded Christendom as one great  commonwealth, presided over by Pope and Emperor, who were the guardians  of international law and arbiters of international relations. The Empire  had long ceased to exercise any control, because it was destitute of  strength. The Papacy, after vainly endeavouring to unite Europe round  the old cry of a crusade against the Turk, had discovered that there was  no European power on which it could rely for support. The old ideas were  gone, the old tribunals were powerless, the old bonds of European union  were dissolved.    The first result of this decay in the mediæval state-system of Europe  was the emergence of vague plans of a universal monarchy. The Empire and  the Papacy had harmonised with the feudal conception of a regulative  supremacy over vassals who were free to act within the limits of their  obligations to their superior lord. When the old superiors were no  longer recognised, the idea of a supremacy still remained; but there was  no other basis possible for that supremacy than a basis of universal  sovereignty. It was long before any state was sufficiently powerful to  venture on such a claim; but the end of the fifteenth century saw France  and Spain united into powerful kingdoms. In France, the policy of Louis  XI. succeeded in reducing the great feudatories, and established the  power of the monarchy as the bond of union between provinces which were  conscious of like interests. In Spain, the marriage of Ferdinand and  Isabella united a warlike people who swept away the remains of the  Moorish kingdom. Germany, though nominally it recognised one ruler, had  sacrificed its national kingship to the futile claims of the Empire. The  emperor had great pretensions, but was himself powerless, and the German  princes steadily refused to lend him help to give reality to his  high-sounding claims. Unconsciously to themselves, the rulers of France  and Spain were preparing to attempt the extension of their power over  the rest of Europe.    France under Charles VIII. was the first to give expression to this new  idea of European politics. The Italian expedition of Charles VIII.  marked the end"]]]
