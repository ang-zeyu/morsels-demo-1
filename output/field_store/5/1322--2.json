To this  proposition it will be for these pages to find answer.    Few men of their own free will seek seclusion, for does not man belong to  the social vertebrates, and do not the instincts of the many rule? And  when an individual is fain to acknowledge himself a variant from the  type, and his characteristics or idiosyncrasies (as you will) to be so  marked as to impel him to deem them sound and reasonable; when, after  sedate and temperate ponderings upon all the aspects of voluntary exile  as affecting his lifetime partner as well as himself, he deliberately  puts himself out of communion with his fellows, does the experiment  constitute him a messenger? Can there be aught of entertainment or  instruction in the message he may fancy himself called upon to deliver?  or, is the fancy merely another phase of the tyranny of temperament?    We cannot always trust in ourselves and in the boldest of our illusions.  There must be trial. Then, if success be achieved and the illusion  becomes real and transcendental, and other things and conditions merely  \"innutritious phantoms,\" were it not wise, indeed essential, to tell of  it all, so that mayhap the illusions of others may be put to the test?    Not that it is good or becoming that many should attempt the part of the  Beachcomber. All cannot play it who would. Few can be indifferent to that  which men commonly prize. All are not free to test touchy problems with  the acid of experience. Besides, there are not enough thoughtful islands  to go round. Only for the few are there ideal or even convenient scenes  for those who, while perceiving some of the charms of solitude, are at  the same time compelled by circumstances ever and anon to administer to  their favourite theories resounding smacks, making them jump to the  practical necessities of the case.    Here then I come to a point at which frankness is necessary. In these  pages there will be an endeavour to refrain from egotism, and yet how may  one who lives a lonesome life on an island and who presumes to write its  history evade that duty? My chief desire is to set down in plain language  the sobrieties of everyday occurrences--the unpretentious homilies of an  unpretentious man--one whose mental bent enabled him to take but a  superficial view of most of the large, heavy and important aspects of  life, but who has found light in things and subjects homely, slight and  casual; who perhaps has queer views on the pursuit of happiness, and who  above all has an inordinate passion for freedom and fresh air.    Moreover, these chronicles really have to do with the lives of two  people--not youthful enthusiasts, but beings who had arrived at an age  when many of the minor romances are of the past. Whosoever looks for the  relation of sensational adventures, exciting situations, or even humorous  predicaments, will assuredly be disappointed. Possibly there may be  something to interest those who wish to learn a few of the details of the  foundation of a home in tropical Australia; and to understand the  conditions of life here, not as they affect the man of independence who  seeks to enlarge his fortune, nor the settler who in the sweat of his  face has to eat bread, but as they affect one to whom has been given  neither poverty nor riches, and who has proved (to his own satisfaction  at least) the wisdom of the sage who wrote--\"If you wish to increase a  man's happiness seek not to increase his possessions, but to decrease his  desires.\" Success will have been achieved if these pages reveal candour  and truthfulness, and if thereby proof is given that in North Queensland  one \"can draw nearer to nature, and though the advantages of civilisation  remain unforfeited, to the happy condition of the simple, uncomplicated  man!\"    In furtherance of the desire that light may shine upon certain phases of  the character of the Australian aboriginal, space is allotted in this  book to selected anecdotes. Some are original; a few have been previously  honoured by print. Others have wandered, unlettered vagrants, so far and  wide as to have lost all record of legitimacy. To these houseless  strangers I gladly offer hospitality, and acknowledge with thankfulness  their cheerful presence.    Grateful acknowledgments are due to Mr F. Manson Bailey, F.L.S., the  official botanist of Queensland, for the scientific nomenclature of trees  and plants referred to in a general way.    E. J. BANFIELD.  BRAMMO BAY, DUNK ISLAND,  November, 1906.          CHAPTER I        THE BEACHCOMBER'S DOMAIN      Two and a half miles off the north-eastern coast of Australia--midway,  roughly speaking, between the southern and the northern limits of the  Great Barrier Reef, that low rampart of coral which is one of the wonders  of the world--is an island bearing the old English name of Dunk.    Other islands and islets are in close proximity, a dozen or so within a  radius of as many miles, but this Dunk Island is the chief of its group,  the largest in area, the highest in altitude, the nearest the mainland,  the fairest, the best. It possesses a well-sheltered haven (herein to be  known as Brammo Bay), and three perennially running creeks mark a further  splendid distinction. It has a superficial area of over three square  miles. Its topography is diversified--hill and valley, forest and jungle,  grassy combes and bare rocky shoulders, gloomy pockets and hollows,  cliffs and precipices, bold promontories and bluffs, sandy beaches, quiet  coves and mangrove flats. A long V-shaped valley opens to the south-east  between steep spurs of a double-peaked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#1)"],[1,"FROM AN OLD MANSE AND OTHER STORIES      by    Nathaniel Hawthorne          Contents        The Birthmark    Young Goodman Brown    Rappaccini's Daughter    Mrs. Bullfrog    The Celestial Railroad    The Procession of Life    Feathertop: A Moralized Legend    Egotism; or, The Bosom Serpent    Drowne's Wooden Image    Roger Malvin's Burial    The Artist of the Beautiful          FROM MOSSES FROM AN OLD MANSE        THE BIRTHMARK    In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an  eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy, who not long  before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more  attractive than any chemical one. He had left his laboratory to the  care of an assistant, cleared his fine countenance from the furnace  smoke, washed the stain of acids from his fingers, and persuaded a  beautiful woman to become his wife. In those days when the  comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred  mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle, it  was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in  its depth and absorbing energy. The higher intellect, the imagination,  the spirit, and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment  in pursuits which, as some of their ardent votaries believed, would  ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another, until the  philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and  perhaps make new worlds for himself. We know not whether Aylmer  possessed this degree of faith in man's ultimate control over Nature.  He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies  ever to be weaned from them by any second passion. His love for his  young wife might prove the stronger of the two; but it could only be by  intertwining itself with his love of science, and uniting the strength  of the latter to his own.    Such a union accordingly took place, and was attended with truly  remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral. One day, very  soon after their marriage, Aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble  in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke.    \"Georgiana,\" said he, \"has it never occurred to you that the mark upon  your cheek might be removed?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said she, smiling; but perceiving the seriousness of his  manner, she blushed deeply. \"To tell you the truth it has been so often  called a charm that I was simple enough to imagine it might be so.\"    \"Ah, upon another face perhaps it might,\" replied her husband; \"but  never on yours. No, dearest Georgiana, you came so nearly perfect from  the hand of Nature that this slightest possible defect, which we  hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty, shocks me, as being the  visible mark of earthly imperfection.\"    \"Shocks you, my husband!\" cried Georgiana, deeply hurt; at first  reddening with momentary anger, but then bursting into tears. \"Then why  did you take me from my mother's side? You cannot love what shocks you!\"    To explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of  Georgiana's left cheek there was a singular mark, deeply interwoven, as  it were, with the texture and substance of her face. In the usual state  of her complexion--a healthy though delicate bloom--the mark wore a  tint of deeper crimson, which imperfectly defined its shape amid the  surrounding rosiness. When she blushed it gradually became more  indistinct, and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that  bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow. But if any shifting  motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again, a crimson  stain upon the snow, in what Aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful  distinctness. Its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand,  though of the smallest pygmy size. Georgiana's lovers were wont to say  that some fairy at her birth hour had laid her tiny hand upon the  infant's cheek, and left this impress there in token of the magic  endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts. Many a  desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing  his lips to the mysterious hand. It must not be concealed, however,  that the impression wrought by this fairy sign manual varied  exceedingly, according to the difference of temperament in the  beholders. Some fastidious persons--but they were exclusively of her  own sex--affirmed that the bloody hand, as they chose to call it, quite  destroyed the effect of Georgiana's beauty, and rendered her  countenance even hideous. But it would be as reasonable to say that one  of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary  marble would convert the Eve of Powers to a monster. Masculine  observers, if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration,  contented themselves with wishing it away, that the world might possess  one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a  flaw. After his marriage,--for he thought little or nothing of the  matter before,--Aylmer discovered that this was the case with himself.    Had she been less beautiful,--if Envy's self could have found aught  else to sneer at,--he might have felt his affection heightened by the  prettiness of this mimic hand, now vaguely portrayed, now lost, now  stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of  emotion that throbbed within her heart; but seeing her otherwise so  perfect, he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with  every moment of their united lives. It was the fatal flaw of humanity  which Nature, in one shape or another, stamps ineffaceably on all her  productions, either to imply that they are temporary and finite, or  that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain. The crimson  hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the  highest and purest of earthly mould, degrading them into kindred with  the lowest, and even with the very brutes, like whom their visible  frames return to dust. In this manner, selecting it as the symbol of  his wife's liability to sin, sorrow, decay, and death, Aylmer's sombre  imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object,  causing him more trouble and horror than ever Georgiana's beauty,  whether of soul or sense, had given him delight.    At all the seasons which should have been their happiest, he invariably  and without intending it, nay, in spite of a purpose to the contrary,  reverted to this one disastrous topic. Trifling as it at first  appeared, it so connected itself with innumerable trains of thought and  modes of feeling that it became the central point of all. With the  morning twilight Aylmer opened his eyes upon his wife's face and  recognized the symbol of imperfection; and when they sat together at  the evening hearth his eyes wandered stealthily to her cheek, and  beheld, flickering with the blaze of the wood fire, the spectral hand  that wrote mortality where he would fain have worshipped. Georgiana  soon learned to shudder at his gaze. It needed but a glance with the  peculiar expression that his face often wore to change the roses of her  cheek into a deathlike paleness, amid which the crimson hand was  brought strongly out, like a bass-relief of ruby on the whitest marble.    Late one night when the lights were growing dim, so as hardly to betray  the stain on the poor wife's cheek, she herself, for the first time,  voluntarily took up the subject.    \"Do you remember, my dear Aylmer,\" said she, with a feeble attempt at a  smile, \"have you any recollection of a dream last night about this  odious hand?\"    \"None! none whatever!\" replied Aylmer, starting; but then he added, in  a dry, cold tone, affected for the sake of concealing the real depth of  his emotion, \"I might well dream of it; for before I fell asleep it had  taken a pretty firm hold of my fancy.\"    \"And you did dream of it?\" continued Georgiana, hastily; for she  dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt what she had to say. \"A  terrible dream! I wonder that you can forget it. Is it possible to  forget this one expression?--'It is in her heart now; we must have it  out!' Reflect, my husband; for by all means I would have you recall  that dream.\"    The mind is in a sad state when Sleep, the all-involving, cannot  confine her spectres within the dim region of her sway, but suffers  them to break forth, affrighting this actual life with secrets that  perchance belong to a deeper one. Aylmer now remembered his dream. He  had fancied himself with his servant Aminadab, attempting an operation  for the removal of the birthmark; but the deeper went the knife, the  deeper sank the hand, until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have  caught hold of Georgiana's heart; whence, however, her husband was  inexorably resolved to cut or wrench it away.    When the dream had shaped itself perfectly in his memory, Aylmer sat in  his wife's presence with a guilty feeling. Truth often finds its way to  the mind close muffled in robes of sleep, and then speaks with  uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an  unconscious self-deception during our waking moments. Until now he had  not been aware of the tyrannizing influence acquired by one idea over  his mind, and of the lengths which he might find in his heart to go for  the sake of giving himself peace.    \"Aylmer,\" resumed Georgiana, solemnly, \"I know not what may be the cost  to both of us to rid me of this fatal birthmark. Perhaps its removal  may cause cureless deformity; or it may be the stain goes as deep as  life itself. Again: do we know that there is a possibility, on any  terms, of unclasping the firm gripe of this little hand which was laid  upon me before I came into the world?\"    \"Dearest Georgiana, I have spent much thought upon the subject,\"  hastily interrupted Aylmer. \"I am convinced of the perfect  practicability of its"]]]
