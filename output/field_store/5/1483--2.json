All they know, all that anyone knows, is that Nikolas  Rokoff has escaped.\"    John Clayton, Lord Greystoke--he who had been \"Tarzan of the Apes\"--sat  in silence in the apartments of his friend, Lieutenant Paul D'Arnot, in  Paris, gazing meditatively at the toe of his immaculate boot.    His mind revolved many memories, recalled by the escape of his  arch-enemy from the French military prison to which he had been  sentenced for life upon the testimony of the ape-man.    He thought of the lengths to which Rokoff had once gone to compass his  death, and he realized that what the man had already done would  doubtless be as nothing by comparison with what he would wish and plot  to do now that he was again free.    Tarzan had recently brought his wife and infant son to London to escape  the discomforts and dangers of the rainy season upon their vast estate  in Uziri--the land of the savage Waziri warriors whose broad African  domains the ape-man had once ruled.    He had run across the Channel for a brief visit with his old friend,  but the news of the Russian's escape had already cast a shadow upon his  outing, so that though he had but just arrived he was already  contemplating an immediate return to London.    \"It is not that I fear for myself, Paul,\" he said at last.   \"Many  times in the past have I thwarted Rokoff's designs upon my life; but  now there are others to consider.  Unless I misjudge the man, he would  more quickly strike at me through my wife or son than directly at me,  for he doubtless realizes that in no other way could he inflict greater  anguish upon me.  I must go back to them at once, and remain with them  until Rokoff is recaptured--or dead.\"    As these two talked in Paris, two other men were talking together in a  little cottage upon the outskirts of London.   Both were dark,  sinister-looking men.    One was bearded, but the other, whose face wore the pallor of long  confinement within doors, had but a few days' growth of black beard  upon his face.  It was he who was speaking.    \"You must needs shave off that beard of yours, Alexis,\" he said to his  companion.  \"With it he would recognize you on the instant.  We must  separate here in the hour, and when we meet again upon the deck of the  Kincaid, let us hope that we shall have with us two honoured guests who  little anticipate the pleasant voyage we have planned for them.    \"In two hours I should be upon my way to Dover with one of them, and by  tomorrow night, if you follow my instructions carefully, you should  arrive with the other, provided, of course, that he returns to London  as quickly as I presume he will.    \"There should be both profit and pleasure as well as other good things  to reward our efforts, my dear Alexis.  Thanks to the stupidity of the  French, they have gone to such lengths to conceal the fact of my escape  for these many days that I have had ample opportunity to work out every  detail of our little adventure so carefully that there is little chance  of the slightest hitch occurring to mar our prospects.  And now  good-bye, and good luck!\"    Three hours later a messenger mounted the steps to the apartment of  Lieutenant D'Arnot.    \"A telegram for Lord Greystoke,\" he said to the servant who answered  his summons.  \"Is he here?\"    The man answered in the affirmative, and, signing for the message,  carried it within to Tarzan, who was already preparing to depart for  London.    Tarzan tore open the envelope, and as he read his face went white.    \"Read it, Paul,\" he said, handing the slip of paper to D'Arnot.  \"It  has come already.\"    The Frenchman took the telegram and read:    \"Jack stolen from the garden through complicity of new servant.  Come  at once.--JANE.\"      As Tarzan leaped from the roadster that had met him at the station and  ran up the steps to his London town house he was met at the door by a  dry-eyed but almost frantic woman.    Quickly Jane Porter Clayton narrated all that she had been able to  learn of the theft of the boy.    The baby's nurse had been wheeling him in the sunshine on the walk  before the house when a closed taxicab drew up at the corner of the  street.  The woman had paid but passing attention to the vehicle,  merely noting that it discharged no passenger, but stood at the kerb  with the motor running as though waiting for a fare from the residence  before which it had stopped.    Almost immediately the new houseman, Carl, had come running from the  Greystoke house, saying that the girl's mistress wished to speak with  her for a moment, and that she was to leave little Jack in his care  until she returned.    The woman said that she entertained not the slightest suspicion of the  man's motives until she had reached the doorway of the house, when it  occurred to her to warn him not to turn the carriage so as to permit  the sun to shine in the baby's eyes.    As she turned about to call this to him she was somewhat surprised to  see that he was wheeling the carriage rapidly toward the corner, and at  the same time she saw the door of the taxicab open and a swarthy face  framed for a moment in the aperture.    Intuitively, the danger to the child flashed upon her, and with a  shriek she dashed down the steps and up the walk toward the taxicab,  into which Carl was now handing the baby to the swarthy one within.    Just before she reached the vehicle, Carl leaped in beside his  confederate, slamming the door behind him.  At the same time the  chauffeur attempted to start his machine, but it was evident that  something had gone wrong, as though the gears refused to mesh, and the  delay caused by this, while he pushed the lever into reverse and backed  the car a few inches before again attempting to go ahead, gave the  nurse time to reach the side of the taxicab.    Leaping to the running-board, she had attempted to snatch the baby from  the arms of the stranger, and here, screaming and fighting, she had  clung to her position even after the taxicab had got under way; nor was  it until the machine had passed the Greystoke residence at good speed  that Carl, with a heavy blow to her face, had succeeded in knocking her  to the pavement.    Her screams had attracted servants and members of the families from  residences near by, as well as from the Greystoke home.  Lady Greystoke  had witnessed the girl's brave battle, and had herself tried to reach  the rapidly passing vehicle, but had been too late.    That was all that anyone knew, nor did Lady Greystoke dream of the  possible identity of the man at the bottom of the plot until her  husband told her of the escape of Nikolas Rokoff from the French prison  where they had hoped he was permanently confined.    As Tarzan and his wife stood planning the wisest course to pursue, the  telephone bell rang in the library at their right.  Tarzan quickly  answered the call in person.    \"Lord Greystoke?\" asked a man's voice at the other end of the line.    \"Yes.\"    \"Your son has been stolen,\" continued the voice, \"and I alone may help  you to recover him.  I am conversant with the plot of those who took  him.  In fact, I was a party to it, and was to share in the reward, but  now they are trying to ditch me, and to be quits with them I will aid  you to recover him on condition that you will not prosecute me for my  part in the crime.  What do you say?\"    \"If you lead me to where my son is hidden,\" replied the ape-man, \"you  need fear nothing from me.\"    \"Good,\" replied the other.  \"But you must come alone to meet me, for it  is enough that I must trust you.  I cannot take the chance of  permitting others to learn my identity.\"    \"Where and when may I meet you?\" asked Tarzan.    The other gave the name and location of a public-house on the  water-front at Dover--a place frequented by sailors.    \"Come,\" he concluded, \"about ten o'clock tonight.  It would do no good  to arrive earlier.  Your son will be safe enough in the meantime, and I  can then lead you secretly to where he is hidden.  But be sure to come  alone, and under no circumstances notify Scotland Yard, for I know you  well and shall be watching for you.    \"Should any other accompany you, or should I see suspicious characters  who might be agents of the police, I shall not meet you, and your last  chance of recovering your son will be gone.\"    Without more words the man rang off.    Tarzan repeated the gist of the conversation to his wife.   She begged  to be allowed to accompany him, but he insisted that it might result in  the man's carrying out his threat of refusing to aid them if Tarzan did  not come alone, and so they parted, he to hasten to Dover, and she,  ostensibly to wait at home until he should notify her of the outcome of  his mission.    Little did either dream of what both were destined to pass through  before they should meet again, or the far-distant--but why anticipate?    For ten minutes after the ape-man had left her Jane Clayton walked  restlessly back and forth across the silken rugs of the library.  Her  mother heart ached, bereft of its first-born.  Her mind was in an  anguish of hopes and fears."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#1)"],[1,"Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.                        COMMON DISEASES OF FARM ANIMALS    By R. A. Craig, D.V.M.    [Illustration: Frontispiece--INSANITARY DAIRY STABLE AND YARDS. DISEASE AND  FINANCIAL LOSS ARE TO BE EXPECTED WHEN FARM ANIMALS ARE KEPT IN FILTHY,  INSANITARY QUARTERS]        PREFACE    In preparing the material for this book, the author has endeavored to  arrange and discuss the subject matter in a way to be of the greatest  service and help to the agricultural student and stockman, and place at  their disposal a text and reference book.    The general discussions at the beginning of the different sections and  chapters, and the discussions of the different diseases are naturally  brief. An effort has been made to conveniently arrange the topics for both  practical and class-room work. The chapters have been grouped under the  necessary heads, with review questions at the end of each chapter, and the  book divided into seven parts.    The chapters on diseases of the locomotory organs, the teeth, surgical  diseases and castration, although not commonly discussed in books of this  class, the writer believes will be of value for reference and instructional  work.    When used as a text-book, it will be well for the instructor to supplement  the text with class-room discussions.    The writer has given special emphasis to the cause and prevention of  disease, and not so much to the medicinal treatment. Stockmen are not  expected to practise the medicinal treatment, but rather the preventive  treatment of disease. For this reason it is not deemed advisable to give a  large number of formulas for the preparation of medicinal mixtures to be  used for the treatment of disease, but such treatment is suggested in the  most necessary cases.

PART I.--INTRODUCTORY      CHAPTER I    GENERAL DISCUSSION OF DISEASE      Disease is the general term for any deviation from the normal or healthy  condition of the body. The morbid processes that result in either slight or  marked modifications of the normal condition are recognized by the  injurious changes in the structure or function of the organ, or group of  body organs involved. The increase in the secretion of urine noticeable in  horses in the late fall and winter is caused by the cool weather and the  decrease in the perspiration. If, however, the increase in the quantity of  urine secreted occurs independently of any normal cause and is accompanied  by an unthrifty and weakened condition of the animal, it would then  characterize disease. Tissues may undergo changes in order to adapt  themselves to different environments, or as a means of protecting  themselves against injuries. The coat of a horse becomes heavy and appears  rough if the animal is exposed to severe cold. A rough, staring coat is  very common in horses affected by disease. The outer layer of the skin  becomes thickened when subject to pressure or friction from the harness.  This change in structure is purely protective and normal. In disease the  deviation from normal must be more permanent in character than it is in the  examples mentioned above, and in some way prove injurious to the body  functions.    CLASSIFICATION.--We may divide diseases into three classes: _non-specific,  specific_ and _parasitic_.    _Non-specific diseases_ have no constant cause. A variety of causes may  produce the same disease. For example, acute indigestion may be caused by a"]]]
