Any one looking for stirring adventures, hairbreadth escapes  from wild animals and men, will be disappointed. In the Australian Bush  the traveller has only Nature to war against--over him hangs always the  chance of death from thirst, and sometimes from the attacks of hostile  aboriginals; he has no spice of adventure, no record heads of rare game,  no exciting escapades with dangerous beasts, to spur him on; no beautiful  scenery, broad lakes, or winding rivers to make life pleasant for him.  The unbroken monotony of an arid, uninteresting country has to be faced.  Nature everywhere demands his toil. Unless he has within him impulses that  give him courage to go on, he will soon return; for he will find nothing  in his surroundings to act as an incentive to tempt him further.    I trust my readers will be able to glean a little knowledge of the  hardships and dangers that beset the paths of Australian pioneers, and  will learn something of the trials and difficulties encountered by a  prospector, recognising that he is often inspired by some higher feeling  than the mere \"lust of gold.\"    Wherever possible, I have endeavoured to add interest to my own  experiences by recounting those of other travellers; and, by studying the  few books that touch upon such matters to explain any points in connection  with the aboriginals that from my own knowledge I am unable to do. I owe  several interesting details to the \"Report on the Work of the Horn  Scientific Expedition to Central Australia,\" and to \"Ethnological Studies  among the North-West Central Queensland Aboriginals,\" by Walter E. Roth.  For the identification of the few geological specimens brought in by me,  I am indebted to the Government Geologist of the Mines Department,  Perth, W.A., and to Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, through the courtesy of the  Director of the Royal Gardens, Kew, for the identification of the plants.    I also owe many thanks to my friend Mr. J. F. Cornish, who has taken so  much trouble in correcting the proofs of my MSS.

Coolgardie, a district then unnamed, had been discovered, and  Arthur Bayley, a persevering and lucky prospector, had returned to  civilised parts from the \"bush,\" his packhorses loaded with golden  specimens from the famous mine which bears his name. I suppose the  fortunate find of Bayley and his mate, Ford, has turned the course of  events in the lives of many tens of thousands of people, and yet, as he  jogged along the track from Gnarlbine Rock to Southern Cross, I daresay  his thoughts reverted to his own life, and the good time before him,  rather than to moralising on the probable effect of his discovery on  others.    We spent as little time as possible at Albany, or, I should say, made our  stay as short as was permitted, for in those days the convenience of the  passenger was thought little of, in comparison with the encouragement of  local industries, so that mails and travellers alike were forced to remain  at least one night in Albany by the arrangement of the train service,  greatly to the benefit of the hotel-keepers.    We were somewhat surprised to see the landlord's daughters waiting at  table. They were such tremendously smart and icy young ladies that at  first we were likely to mistake them for guests; and even when sure of  their identity we were too nervous to ask for anything so vulgar as a pot  of beer, or to expect them to change our plates.    Between Albany and Perth the country is not at all interesting being for  the most part flat, scrubby, and sandy, though here and there are rich  farming and agricultural districts. Arrived at Perth we found ourselves a  source of great interest to the inhabitants, inasmuch as we announced our  intention of making our way to the goldfields, while we had neither the  means nor apparently the capability of getting there. Though treated with  great hospitality, we found it almost impossible to get any information  or assistance, all our inquiries being answered by some scoffing remark,  such as, \"Oh, you'll never get there!\"    We attended a rather remarkable dinner--given in honour of the Boot, Shoe,  Harness, and Leather trade, at the invitation of a fellow-countryman in  the trade, and enjoyed ourselves immensely; speech-making and  toast-drinking being carried out in the extensive style so customary in  the West. Picture our surprise on receiving a bill for 10s. 6d. next  morning! Our friend of the dinner, kindly put at our disposal a hansom  cab which he owned, but this luxury we declined with thanks, fearing a  repetition of his \"bill-by-invitation.\"    Owing to the extreme kindness of Mr. Robert Smith we were at last enabled  to get under way for the scene of the \"rush.\" Disregarding the many offers  of men willing to guide us along a self-evident track, we started with one  riding and one packhorse each. These and the contents of the pack-bags  represented all our worldly possessions, but in this we might count  ourselves lucky, for many hundreds had to carry their belongings on their  backs--\"humping their bluey,\" as the expression is.    Our road lay through Northam, and the several small farms and settlements  which extend some distance eastward. Very few used this track, the more  popular and direct route being through York,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#1)"],[1,"Fielding of the Red Mill    or    Jasper Parloe's Secret    by Alice B. Emerson, 1913        CHAPTER I     THE RED FLAME IN THE NIGHT    The sound of the drumming wheels! It had roared in the ears of Ruth  Fielding for hours as she sat on the comfortably upholstered seat in  the last car of the afternoon Limited, the train whirling her from the  West to the East, through the fertile valleys of Upper New York State.    This had been a very long journey for the girl, but Ruth knew that it  would soon come to an end. Cheslow was not many miles ahead now; she  had searched it out upon the railroad timetable, and upon the map  printed on the back of the sheet; and as the stations flew by, she had  spelled their names out with her quick eyes, until dusk had fallen and  she could no longer see more than the signal lamps and switch targets  as the train whirled her on.    But she still stared through the window. This last car of the train  was fairly well filled, but she had been fortunate in having a seat  all to herself; she was glad this was so, for a person in the seat  with her might have discovered how hard it was for her to keep back  the tears.    For Ruth Fielding was by no means one of the \"crying kind,\" and she  had forbidden herself the luxury of tears on this occasion.    \"We had all that out weeks ago, you know we did!\" she whispered,  apostrophizing that inner self that really wanted to break the brave  compact. \"When we knew we had to leave dear old Darrowtown, and Miss  True Pettis, and Patsy Hope, and--and 'all other perspiring friends,'  to quote Amoskeag Lanfell's letter that she wrote home from  Conference.    \"No, Ruth Fielding! Uncle Jabez Potter may be the very nicest kind of  an old dear. And to live in a mill--and one painted red, too! That  ought to make up for a good many disappointments--\"    Her soliloquy was interrupted by a light tap upon her shoulder. Ruth  glanced around and up quickly. She saw standing beside her the tall  old gentleman who had been sitting two seats behind on the other side  of the aisle ever since the train left Buffalo.    He was a spare old gentleman, with a gaunt, eagle-beaked face, cleanly  shaven but for a sweeping iron-gray mustache, his iron-gray hair waved  over the collar of his black coat--a regular mane of hair which  flowed out from under the brim of his well-brushed, soft-crowned hat.  His face would have been very stern in its expression had it not been  for the little twinkle in his bright, dark eyes.    \"Why don't you do it?\" he asked Ruth, softly.    \"Why don't I do what, sir?\" she responded, not without a little gulp,  for that lump would rise in her throat.    \"Why don't you cry?\" questioned the strange old gentleman, still  speaking softly and with that little twinkle in his eye.    \"Because I am determined not to cry, sir,\" and now Ruth could call up  a little smile, though perhaps the corners of her mouth trembled a  bit.    The gentleman sat down beside her, although she had not invited him to  do so. She was not at all afraid of him and, after all, perhaps she  was glad to have him do it.    \"Tell me all about it,\" he suggested, with such an air of confidence  and interest that Ruth warmed more and more toward him.    But it was a little hard to begin. When he told her, however, that he  was going to Cheslow, too--indeed, that that was his home--it was  easier by far.    \"I am Doctor Davison, my dear,\" he said. \"If you are going to live in  Cheslow you will hear all about Doctor Davison, and you would better  know him at first-hand, to avoid mistakes,\" and his eyes twinkled more  than ever, though his stern mouth never relaxed.    \"I expect that my new home is some little way outside of Cheslow,\"  Ruth said, timidly. \"They call it the Red Mill.\"    The humorous light faded out of the dark, bright eyes of the  gentleman. Yet even then his countenance did not impress her as being  unkindly.    \"Jabez Potter's mill,\" he said, thoughtfully.    \"Yes, sir. That is my uncle's name.\"    \"Your uncle?\"    \"My great uncle, to be exact,\" said Ruth. \"He was mother's uncle.\"    \"Then you,\" he said, speaking even more gently than before, \"are  little Mary Potter's daughter?\"    \"Mother was Mary Potter before she married papa,\" said Ruth, more  easily now. \"She died four years ago.\"    He nodded, looking away from her out of the window at the  fast-darkening landscape which hurried by them.    \"And poor papa died last winter. I had no claim upon the kind friends  who helped me when he died,\" pursued Ruth, bravely. \"They wrote to  Uncle Jabez and he--he said I could come and live with him and Aunt  Alvirah Boggs.\"    In a flash the twinkle came back into his eyes, and he nodded again.    \"Ah, yes! Aunt Alviry,\" he said, giving the name its old-fashioned,  homely pronunciation. \"I had forgotten Aunt Alviry,\" and he seemed  quite pleased to remember her.    \"She keeps house for Uncle Jabez, I understand,\" Ruth continued. \"But  she isn't my aunt.\"    \"She is everybody's Aunt Alviry, I think,\" said Doctor Davison,  encouragingly.    For some reason this made Ruth feel better. He spoke as though she  would love Aunt Alviry, and Ruth had left so many kind friends behind  her in Darrowtown that she was glad to be assured that somebody in the  new home where she was going would be kind, too.    Miss True Pettis had not shown her Uncle Jabez's letter and she had  feared that perhaps her mother's uncle (whom she had never seen nor  known much about) might not have written as kindly for his niece to  come to the Red Mill as Miss True could have wished. But Miss True was  poor; most of the Darrowtown friends had been poor people. Ruth had  felt that she could not remain a burden on them.    Somehow she did not have to explain all this to Doctor Davison. He  seemed to understand it when he nodded and his eyes twinkled so  glowingly.    \"Cheslow is a pleasant town. You will like it,\" he said, cheerfully.  \"The Red Mill is five miles out on the Lake Osago Road. It is a pretty  country. It will be dark when you ride over it to-night; but you will  like it when you see it by daylight.\"    He took it for granted that Uncle Jabez would come to the station to  meet her with a carriage, and that comforted Ruth not a little.    \"You will pass my house on that road,\" continued Doctor Davison. \"But  when you come to town you must not pass it.\"    \"Sir?\" she asked him, surprised.    \"Not without stopping to see me,\" he explained, his eyes twinkling  more than ever. And then he left her and went back to his seat.    But Ruth found, when he had gone, that the choke came back into her  throat again and the sting of unshed tears to her eyes. But she would  not let those same tears fall!    She stared out of the plate-glass window and saw that it was now quite  dark. The whistle of the fast-flying locomotive shrieked its  long-drawn warning, and a group of signal lights flashed past. Then  she heard the loud ringing of a gong at a grade crossing. They must be  nearing Cheslow now.    And then she saw that they were on a curve quite a sharp curve, for  she saw the lights of the locomotive and the mail car far ahead upon  the gleaming rails. They began to slow down, too, and the wheels  wailed under the pressure of the brakes.    She could see the signal lights along the tracks ahead and then--with  a start, for she knew what it meant--a sharp red flame appeared out  of the darkness beyond the rushing engine pilot.    Danger! That is what that red light meant. The brakes clamped down  upon the wheels again so suddenly that the easily-riding coach jarred  through all its parts. The red eye was winked out instantly; but the  long and heavy train came to an abrupt stop.      CHAPTER II     RENO    But the Limited had stopped so that Ruth could see along the length of  the train. Lanterns winked and blinked in the dark as the trainmen  carried them forward. Something had happened up front of more  importance than an ordinary halt for permission to run in on the next  block. Besides, the afternoon Limited was a train of the first-class  and was supposed to have the right of way over all other trains. No  signal should have stopped it here.    \"How far are we from Cheslow, please?\" she asked of the rear brakeman  (whom she knew was called the flagman) as he came down the car with  his lantern.    \"Not above a mile, Miss,\" he replied.    His smile, and his way of speaking, encouraged her to ask:    \"Can you tell me why we have stopped?\"    \"Something on the track, Miss. I have set out my signal lamp and am  going forward to inquire.\"    Three or four of the male passengers followed him out of the car. Ruth  saw that quite a number had disembarked from the cars ahead, that a  goodly company was moving forward, and that there were ladies among  the curious crowd. If it was perfectly safe for them to satisfy their  curiosity, why not she? She arose and hurried out of the car,  following the swinging lamp of the brakeman as he strode on.    Ruth ran a little, seeing well enough to pick her way over the ends of  the ties, and arrived to find at least half a hundred people grouped  on the track ahead of the locomotive pilot. The great, unblinking,  white eye of the huge machine revealed the group clearly--and the  object around which the curious passengers, as well as the train crew,  had gathered.    It was a dog--a great, handsome, fawn-colored mastiff, sleek of coat  and well fed, but muddied now along his flanks, evidently having waded  through the mire of the wet meadow beside the tracks. He had come  under, or through, a barbed wire fence, too, for there was a long  scratch upon his shoulder and another raw cut upon his muzzle.    To his broad collar was fastened a red lamp. Nobody had taken it off,  for both the train men and the passengers were excitedly discussing  what his presence here might mean; and some of them seemed afraid of  the great fellow.    But Ruth had been used to dogs,"]]]
