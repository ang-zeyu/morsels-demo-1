The Mahabharata of    Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa    BOOK 2    SABHA PARVA    Translated into English Prose from the Original Sanskrit Text    by    Kisari Mohan Ganguli    [1883-1896]                SECTION I    (Sabhakriya Parva)    Om! After having bowed down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted  male being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be  uttered.    Vaisampayana said,--\"Then, in the presence of Vasudeva, Maya Danava,  having worshipped Arjuna, repeatedly spoke unto him with joined hands  and in amiable words,--'O son of Kunti, saved have I been by thee from  this Krishna in spate and from Pavaka (fire) desirous of consuming me.  Tell me what I have to do for thee.'    \"Arjuna said,--'O great Asura, everything hath already been done by  thee (even by this offer of thine). Blest be thou. Go whithersoever  thou likest. Be kind and well-disposed towards me, as we are even kind  to and well-pleased with thee!'    \"Maya said,--'O bull amongst men, what thou hast said is worthy of  thee, O exalted one. But O Bharata, I desire to do something for thee  cheerfully. I am a great artist, a Viswakarma among the Danavas. O son  of Pandu, being what I am, I desire to do something for thee.'    \"Arjuna said,--'O sinless one, thou regardest thyself as saved (by me)  from imminent death. Even if it hath been so, I cannot make thee do  anything for me. At the same time, O Danava, I do not wish to frustrate  thy intentions. Do thou something for Krishna. That will be a  sufficient requital for my services to thee.'\"    Vaisampayana said,--\"Then, O bull of the Bharata race, urged by Maya,  Vasudeva reflected for a moment as to what he should ask Maya to  accomplish. Krishna, the Lord of the universe and the Creator of every  object, having reflected in his mind, thus commanded Maya,--'Let a  palatial sabha (meeting hall) as thou choosest, be built (by thee), if  thou, O son of Diti, who art the foremost of all artists, desirest to  do good to Yudhishthira the just. Indeed, build thou such a palace that  persons belonging to the world of men may not be able to imitate it  even after examining it with care, while seated within. And, O Maya,  build thou a mansion in which we may behold a combination of godly,  asuric and human designs.'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"Having heard those words, Maya became  exceedingly glad. And he forthwith built a magnificent palace for the  son of Pandu like unto the palace of the celestials themselves. Then  Krishna and Partha (Arjuna) after having narrated everything unto king  Yudhishthira the just, introduced Maya unto him. Yudhishthira received  Maya with respect, offering him the honour he deserved. And, O Bharata,  Maya accepted that honour thinking highly of it. O monarch of the  Bharata race, that great son of Diti then recited unto the sons of  Pandu the history of the Danava Vrisha-parva, and that foremost of  artists then, having rested awhile, set himself after much thoughtful  planning to build a palace for the illustrious sons of Pandu. Agreeably  to the wishes of both Krishna and the sons of Pritha, the illustrious  Danava of great prowess, having performed on an auspicious day the  initial propitiatory rites of foundation and having also gratified  thousands of well-versed Brahmanas with sweetened milk and rice and  with rich presents of various kinds, measured out a plot of land five  thousand cubits square, which was delightful and exceedingly handsome  to behold and which was favourable for construction of a building  well-suited to the exigencies of every season.\"      SECTION II    Vaisampayana said,--\"Janardana deserving the worship of all, having  lived happily at Khandavaprastha for some time, and having been treated  all the while with respectful love and affection by the sons of Pritha,  became desirous one day of leaving Khandavaprastha to behold his  father. That possessor of large eyes, unto whom was due the obeisance  of the universe, then saluted both Yudhishthira and Pritha and made  obeisance with his head unto the feet of Kunti, his father's sister.  Thus revered by Kesava, Pritha smelt his head and embraced him. The  illustrious Hrishikesa approached his own sister Subhadra  affectionately, with his eyes filled with tears, and spoke unto her  words of excellent import and truth, terse proper, unanswerable and  fraught with good. The sweet-speeched Subhadra also, saluting him in  return and worshipping him repeatedly with bent head, told him all that  she wished to be conveyed to her relatives on the paternal side. And  bidding her farewell and uttering benedictions on his handsome sister,  he of the Vrishni race, next saw Draupadi and Dhaumya. That best of men  duly made obeisance unto Dhaumya, and consoling Draupadi obtained leave  from her. Then the learned and mighty Krishna, accompanied by Partha,  went to his cousins. And surrounded by the five brothers, Krishna shone  like Sakra in the midst of the celestials. He whose banner bore the  figure of Garuda, desirous of performing the rites preparatory to the  commencement of a journey, purified himself by a bath and adorned his  person with ornaments. The bull of the Yadu race then worshipped the  gods and Brahmanas with floral wreaths, mantras, bows of the head, and  excellent perfumes. Having finished all these rites, that foremost of  steady and virtuous persons then thought of setting out. The chief of  the Yadu race then came out of the inner to the outer apartment, and  issuing thence he made unto Brahmanas, deserving of worship, offerings  of vessel-fulls of curd and fruits, and parched-grain and caused them  to pronounce benedictions upon him. And making unto them presents also  of wealth, he went round them. Then ascending his excellent car of gold  endued with great speed and adorned with banner bearing the figure of  Tarkhya (Garuda) and furnished also with mace, discus, sword, his bow  Sharnga and other weapons, and yoking thereunto his horses Saivya and  Sugriva, he of eyes like lotuses set out at an excellent moment of a  lunar day of auspicious stellar conjunction. And Yudhishthira, the king  of the Kurus, from affection, ascended the chariot after Krishna, and  causing that best charioteer Daruka to stand aside, himself took the  reins. And Arjuna also, of long arms, riding on that car, walked round  Krishna and fanned him with a white chamara furnished with a handle of  gold. And the mighty Bhimasena accompanied by the twin brothers Nakula  and Sahadeva and the priests and citizens all followed Krishna from  behind. And Kesava, that slayer of hostile heroes, followed by all the  brothers, shone like a preceptor followed by his favourite pupils. Then  Govinda spoke unto Arjuna and clasped him firmly, and worshipping  Yudhisthira and Bhima, embraced the twins. And embraced in return by  the three elder Pandavas, he was reverentially saluted by the twins.  After having gone about half a Yojana (two miles), Krishna, that  subjugator of hostile towns, respectfully addressed Yudhishthira and  requested him, O Bharata, to stop following him further. And Govinda,  conversant with every duty, then reverentially saluted Yudhishthira and  took hold of his feet. But Yudhishthira soon raised Kesava and smelt  his head. King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pandu, having raised  Krishna endued with eyes like lotus-petals and the foremost of the  Yadava race, gave him leave, saying,--'Good bye!' Then the slayer of  Madhu, making an appointment with them (about his return) in words that  were proper, and preventing with difficulty the Pandavas from following  him further on foot, gladly proceeded towards his own city, like Indra  going towards Amravati. Out of the love and affection they bore him,  the Pandavas gazed on Krishna as long as he was within sight, and their  minds also followed him when he got out of sight. And Kesava of  agreeable person soon disappeared from their sight, unsatiated though  their minds were with looking at him. Those bulls among men, the sons  of Pritha, with minds fixed on Govinda, desisted (from following him  further) and unwillingly returned to their own city in haste. And  Krishna in his car soon reached Dwaraka followed by that hero Satyaki.  Then Sauri, the son of Devaki, accompanied by his charioteer Daruka  reached Dwaraka with the speed of Garuda.\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"Meanwhile king Yudhishthira of unfading  glory, accompanied by his brothers and surrounded by friends, entered  his excellent capital. And that tiger among men, dismissing all his  relatives, brothers, and sons, sought to make himself happy in the  company of Draupadi. And Kesava also, worshipped by the principal  Yadavas including Ugrasena, entered with a happy heart his own  excellent city. And worshipping his old father and his illustrious  mother, and saluting (his brother) Valadeva, he of eyes like  lotus-petals took his seat. Embracing Pradyumna, Shamva, Nishatha,  Charudeshna, Gada, Aniruddha and Bhanu, and obtaining the leave of all  the elderly men, Janardana entered the apartments of Rukmini.\"      SECTION III    Vaisampayana said,--\"Then Maya Danava addressed Arjuna, that foremost  of successful warriors, saying,--'I now go with thy leave, but shall  come back soon.

LEGENDS, TRADITIONS, AND LAWS OF THE    IROQUOIS, OR SIX NATIONS    AND    HISTORY OF THE TUSCARORA INDIANS    BY    ELIAS JOHNSON,    A NATIVE TUSCARORA CHIEF.                INTRODUCTION.    \"A book about Indians!\"--who cares anything about them?    This will probably be the exclamation of many who glance on my little  page. To those who know nothing concerning them, a whole book about  Indians will seem a very prosy affair, to whom I can answer nothing, for  they will not proceed as far as my Preface to see what reasons I can  render for the seeming folly.    But to those who are willing to listen, I can say that the Indians are a  very interesting people, whether I have made an interesting book about  them or not.    The Antiquarian, the Historian, and the Scholar, have been a long time  studying Indian character, and have given plenty of information  concerning the Indian, but it is all in ponderous volumes for State and  College libraries, and quite inaccessible to the multitude--those who  only take up such book as may be held in the hand, sitting by the  fire,--still remain very ignorant of the Children of Nature who inhabited  the forests before the Saxon set his foot upon our shores.    There is also a great deal of prejudice, the consequence of this  ignorance, and the consequence of the representations of your forefathers  who were brought into contact with the Indians, under circumstances that  made it impossible to judge impartially and correctly.    The Histories which are in the schools, and from which the first  impressions are obtained, are still very deficient in what they relate of  Indian History, and most of them are still filling the minds of children  and youth, with imperfect ideas. I have read many of the Histories, and  have longed to see refuted the slanders, and blot out the dark pictures  which the historians have wont to spread abroad concerning us. May I live  to see the day when it may be done, for most deeply have I learned to  blush for my people.    I thought, at first, of only giving a series of Indian Biographies, but  without some knowledge of the government and religion of the Iroquois,  the character of the Indians could not be understood or appreciated.    I enter upon the task with much distrust. It is a difficult task at all  times to speak and to write in foreign language, and I fear I shall not  succeed to the satisfaction of myself, or to my readers.    My title will not be so attractive to the American ears, as if it related  to any other unknown people. A tour in Arabia, or Spain, or in India, or  some other foreign country, with far less important and interesting  material, would secure a greater number of readers, as we are always more  curious about things afar off.    I might have covered many pages with \"Indian Atrocities,\" but these have  been detailed in other histories, till they are familiar to every ear,  and I had neither room nor inclination for even a glance at war and its  dark records.    THE AUTHOR.          PREFACE.    To animate a kinder feeling between the white people and the Indians,  established by a truer knowledge of our civil and domestic life, and of  our capabilities for future elevation, is the motive for which this work  is founded.    The present Tuscarora Indians, the once powerful and gifted nation, after  their expulsion from the South, came North, and were initiated in the  confederacy of the Iroquois, and who formerly held under their  jurisdiction the largest portion of the Eastern States, now dwell within  your bounds, as dependent nations, subject to the guardianship and  supervision of a people who displaced their forefathers. Our numbers, the  circumstances of our past history and present condition, and more  especially the relation in which we stand to the people of the State,  suggest many important questions concerning our future destiny.    Being born to an inauspicious fate, which makes us the _inheritors of  many wrongs_, we have been unable, of ourselves, to escape from the  complicated difficulties which accelerate our decline. To make worse  these adverse influences, the public estimation of the Indian, resting,  as it does, upon the imperfect knowledge of their character, and infused,  as it ever has been, with the prejudice, is universally unjust.    The time has come in which it is no more than right to cast away all  ancient antipathies, all inherited opinions, and to take a nearer view of  our social life, condition and wants, and to learn anew your duty  concerning the Indians. Nevertheless, the embarrassments that have  obstructed our progress, in the obscurity which we have lived, and the  prevailing indifference to our welfare, we have gradually overcame many  of the evils inherent in our social system, and raised ourselves to a  degree of prosperity. Our present condition, if considered in connection  with the ordeal through which we have passed, shows that there is the  presence of an element in our character which must eventually lead to  important results.    As I do not profess that this work is based upon authorities, a question  might arise in the breast of some reader, where these materials were  derived, or what reliance is to be placed upon its contents. The  credibility of a witness is known to depend chiefly upon his means of  knowledge. For this reason, I deem it important to state, that I was born  and brought up by Tuscarora Indian parents on their Reservation in the  Town of Lewiston, N.Y. From my childhood up was naturally inquisitive and  delighted in thrilling stories, which led me to frequent the old people  of my childhood's days, and solicited them to relate the old Legends and  their Traditions, which they always delighted to do. I have sat by their  fireside and heard them, and thus they were instilled upon my young mind.  I also owe much of my information to our Chief, JOHN MT. PLEASANT. I have  also read much of Indian history, and compared them with our LEGENDS and  TRADITIONS.    THE AUTHOR.          THE IROQUOIS.      NATIONAL TRAITS OF CHARACTER.    In all the early histories of the American Colonies, in the stories of  Indian life and the delineations of Indian character, these children of  nature are represented as savages and barbarians, and in the mind of a  large portion of the community the sentiment still prevails that they  were blood-thirsty, revengeful, and merciless, justly a terror to both  friends and foes. Children are impressed with the idea that an Indian is  scarcely human, and as much to be feared as the most ferocious animal of  the forest.    Novelists have now and then clothed a few with a garb which excites your  imagination, but seldom has one been invested with qualities which you  would love, unless it were also said that through some captive taken in  distant war, he inherited a whiter skin and a paler blood.    But I am inclined to think that Indians are not alone in being  savage--not alone barbarous, heartless, and merciless.    It is said they were exterminating each other by aggressive and  devastating wars, before the white people came among them. But wars,  aggressive and exterminating wars, certainly, are not proofs of  barbarity. The bravest warrior was the most honored, and this has been  ever true of Christian nations, and those who call themselves christians  have not yet ceased to look upon him who could plan most successfully the  wholesale slaughter of human beings, as the most deserving his king's or  his country's laurels. How long since the pean died away in praise of the  Duke of Wellington? What have been the wars in which all Europe, or of  America, has been engaged, That there has been no records of her history?  For what are civilized and christian nations drenching their fields with  blood?    It is said the Indian was cruel to the captives, and inflicted  unspeakable torture upon his enemy taken in battle. But from what we know  of them, it is not to be inferred that Indian Chiefs were ever guilty of  filling dungeons with innocent victims, or slaughtering hundreds and  thousands of their own people, whose only sin was a quiet dissent from  some religious dogma. Towards their enemies they were often relentless,  and they had good reason to look upon the white man as their enemy. They  slew them in battle, plotted against them secretly, and in a few  instances comparatively, subjected individuals to torture, burned them at  the stake, and, perhaps, flayed them alive. But who knows anything of the  precepts and practices of the Roman Catholic Christendom, and quote these  things as proofs of unmitigated barbarity.    At the very time that the Indians were using the tomahawk and scalping-  knife to avenge their wrongs, peaceful citizens in every country of  Europe, where the Pope was the man of authority, were incarcerated for no  crime whatever, and such refinement of torture invented and practiced, as  never entered in the heart of the fiercest Indian warrior that roamed the  wilderness to inflict upon man or beast.    We know very little of the secrets of the inquisition, and this little  chills our blood with horror. Yet these things were done in the name of  Christ, the Savior of the World, the Prince of Peace, and not savage, but  civilized. Christian men looked on, not coldly, but rejoicingly, while  women and children writhed in flames and weltered in blood.
