FRIENDS OF CHILDHOOD            I    Dr. Howard Archie had just come up from a game of pool with the Jewish  clothier and two traveling men who happened to be staying overnight in  Moonstone. His offices were in the Duke Block, over the drug store.  Larry, the doctor's man, had lit the overhead light in the waiting-room  and the double student's lamp on the desk in the study. The isinglass  sides of the hard-coal burner were aglow, and the air in the study was  so hot that as he came in the doctor opened the door into his little  operating-room, where there was no stove. The waiting room was carpeted  and stiffly furnished, something like a country parlor. The study had  worn, unpainted floors, but there was a look of winter comfort about it.  The doctor's flat-top desk was large and well made; the papers were in  orderly piles, under glass weights. Behind the stove a wide bookcase,  with double glass doors, reached from the floor to the ceiling. It was  filled with medical books of every thickness and color. On the top shelf  stood a long row of thirty or forty volumes, bound all alike in dark  mottled board covers, with imitation leather backs.    As the doctor in New England villages is proverbially old, so the doctor  in small Colorado towns twenty-five years ago was generally young.  Dr. Archie was barely thirty. He was tall, with massive shoulders  which he held stiffly, and a large, well-shaped head. He was a  distinguished-looking man, for that part of the world, at least.    There was something individual in the way in which his reddish-brown  hair, parted cleanly at the side, bushed over his high forehead. His  nose was straight and thick, and his eyes were intelligent. He wore a  curly, reddish mustache and an imperial, cut trimly, which made him look  a little like the pictures of Napoleon III. His hands were large and  well kept, but ruggedly formed, and the backs were shaded with crinkly  reddish hair. He wore a blue suit of woolly, wide-waled serge; the  traveling men had known at a glance that it was made by a Denver tailor.  The doctor was always well dressed.    Dr. Archie turned up the student's lamp and sat down in the swivel chair  before his desk. He sat uneasily, beating a tattoo on his knees with his  fingers, and looked about him as if he were bored. He glanced at his  watch, then absently took from his pocket a bunch of small keys,  selected one and looked at it. A contemptuous smile, barely perceptible,  played on his lips, but his eyes remained meditative. Behind the door  that led into the hall, under his buffalo-skin driving-coat, was a locked  cupboard. This the doctor opened mechanically, kicking aside a pile of  muddy overshoes. Inside, on the shelves, were whiskey glasses and  decanters, lemons, sugar, and bitters. Hearing a step in the empty,  echoing hall without, the doctor closed the cupboard again, snapping the  Yale lock. The door of the waiting-room opened, a man entered and came  on into the consulting-room.    \"Good-evening, Mr. Kronborg,\" said the doctor carelessly. \"Sit down.\"    His visitor was a tall, loosely built man, with a thin brown beard,  streaked with gray. He wore a frock coat, a broad-brimmed black hat, a  white lawn necktie, and steel rimmed spectacles. Altogether there was a  pretentious and important air about him, as he lifted the skirts of his  coat and sat down.    \"Good-evening, doctor. Can you step around to the house with me? I think  Mrs. Kronborg will need you this evening.\" This was said with profound  gravity and, curiously enough, with a slight embarrassment.    \"Any hurry?\" the doctor asked over his shoulder as he went into his  operating-room.    Mr. Kronborg coughed behind his hand, and contracted his brows. His face  threatened at every moment to break into a smile of foolish excitement.  He controlled it only by calling upon his habitual pulpit manner. \"Well,  I think it would be as well to go immediately. Mrs. Kronborg will be  more comfortable if you are there. She has been suffering for some  time.\"    The doctor came back and threw a black bag upon his desk. He wrote some  instructions for his man on a prescription pad and then drew on his  overcoat. \"All ready,\" he announced, putting out his lamp. Mr. Kronborg  rose and they tramped through the empty hall and down the stairway to  the street. The drug store below was dark, and the saloon next door was  just closing. Every other light on Main Street was out.    On either side of the road and at the outer edge of the board sidewalk,  the snow had been shoveled into breastworks. The town looked small and  black, flattened down in the snow, muffled and all but extinguished.  Overhead the stars shone gloriously. It was impossible not to notice  them. The air was so clear that the white sand hills to the east of  Moonstone gleamed softly. Following the Reverend Mr. Kronborg along the  narrow walk, past the little dark, sleeping houses, the doctor looked up  at the flashing night and whistled softly. It did seem that people were  stupider than they need be; as if on a night like this there ought to be  something better to do than to sleep nine hours, or to assist Mrs.  Kronborg in functions which she could have performed so admirably  unaided. He wished he had gone down to Denver to hear Fay Templeton sing  \"See-Saw.\" Then he remembered that he had a personal interest in this  family, after all. They turned into another street and saw before them  lighted windows; a low story-and-a-half house, with a wing built on at  the right and a kitchen addition at the back, everything a little on the  slant--roofs, windows, and doors. As they approached the gate, Peter  Kronborg's pace grew brisker. His nervous, ministerial cough annoyed the  doctor. \"Exactly as if he were going to give out a text,\" he thought. He  drew off his glove and felt in his vest pocket. \"Have a troche,  Kronborg,\" he said, producing some. \"Sent me for samples. Very good for  a rough throat.\"    \"Ah, thank you, thank you. I was in something of a hurry. I neglected to  put on my overshoes. Here we are, doctor.\" Kronborg opened his front  door--seemed delighted to be at home again.    The front hall was dark and cold; the hatrack was hung with an  astonishing number of children's hats and caps and cloaks. They were  even piled on the table beneath the hatrack. Under the table was a heap  of rubbers and overshoes. While the doctor hung up his coat and hat,  Peter Kronborg opened the door into the living-room. A glare of light  greeted them, and a rush of hot, stale air, smelling of warming  flannels.    At three o'clock in the morning Dr. Archie was in the parlor putting on  his cuffs and coat--there was no spare bedroom in that house. Peter  Kronborg's seventh child, a boy, was being soothed and cosseted by his  aunt, Mrs. Kronborg was asleep, and the doctor was going home. But he  wanted first to speak to Kronborg, who, coatless and fluttery, was  pouring coal into the kitchen stove. As the doctor crossed the  dining-room he paused and listened. From one of the wing rooms, off to  the left, he heard rapid, distressed breathing. He went to the kitchen  door.    \"One of the children sick in there?\" he asked, nodding toward the  partition.    Kronborg hung up the stove-lifter and dusted his fingers. \"It must be  Thea. I meant to ask you to look at her. She has a croupy cold. But in  my excitement--Mrs. Kronborg is doing finely, eh, doctor? Not many of  your patients with such a constitution, I expect.\"    \"Oh, yes. She's a fine mother.\" The doctor took up the lamp from the  kitchen table and unceremoniously went into the wing room. Two chubby  little boys were asleep in a double bed, with the coverlids over their  noses and their feet drawn up. In a single bed, next to theirs, lay a  little girl of eleven, wide awake, two yellow braids sticking up on the  pillow behind her. Her face was scarlet and her eyes were blazing.    The doctor shut the door behind him. \"Feel pretty sick, Thea?\" he asked  as he took out his thermometer. \"Why didn't you call somebody?\"    She looked at him with greedy affection. \"I thought you were here,\" she  spoke between quick breaths. \"There is a new baby, isn't there? Which?\"    \"Which?\" repeated the doctor.    \"Brother or sister?\"    He smiled and sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Brother,\" he said,  taking her hand. \"Open.\"    \"Good. Brothers are better,\" she murmured as he put the glass tube under  her tongue.    \"Now, be still, I want to count.\" Dr. Archie reached for her hand and  took out his watch. When he put her hand back under the quilt he went  over to one of the windows--they were both tight shut--and lifted it a  little way. He reached up and ran his hand along the cold, unpapered  wall. \"Keep under the covers; I'll come back to you in a moment,\" he  said, bending over the glass lamp with his thermometer. He winked at her  from the door before he shut it.    Peter Kronborg was sitting in his wife's room, holding the bundle which  contained his son. His air of cheerful importance, his beard and  glasses, even his shirt-sleeves, annoyed the doctor. He beckoned  Kronborg into the living-room and said sternly:--    \"You've got a very sick child in there. Why didn't you call me before?  It's pneumonia, and she must have been sick for several days. Put the  baby down somewhere, please, and help me make up the bed-lounge here in  the parlor. She's got to be in a warm room, and she's got to be quiet.  You must keep the other children out. Here, this thing opens up, I see,\"  swinging back the top of the carpet lounge. \"We can lift her mattress  and carry her in just as she is.

These were Messer Carlo Lanti and his inamorata, together with a suite  of tentmen, pages, falconers, bed-carriers, and other personnel of a  migratory lord on his way from the cooling hills to the Indian summer of  the plains.  The chief of the little party, halting in advance of his  fellows, lifted his plumed scarlet biretta with one strong young hand,  and with the other, his reins hanging loose, ran a cluster of swarthy  fingers through his black hair.    'O little host!' he boomed, blaspheming--for all good Catholics,  conscious of their exclusive caste, swore by God prescriptively--'O  little host, by the thirst of Christ's passion, wine!'    'He will bring you hyssop--by the token, he will,' murmured the lady,  who sat her white palfrey languidly beside him.  She was a slumberous,  ivory-faced creature warm and insolent and lazy; and the little bells of  her bridle tinkled sleepily, as her horse pawed, gently rocking her.    The cavalier grunted ferociously.  'Let me see him!' and, bonneting  himself again, sat with right arm akimbo, glaring for a response to his  cry.  He looked on first acquaintance a bully and profligate--which he  was; but, for his times, with some redeeming features.  His thigh, in  its close violet hose, and the long blade which hung at it seemed  somehow in a common accord of steel and muscle.  His jaw was underhung,  his brows were very thick and black, but the eyes beneath were  good-humored, and he had a great dimple in his cheek.    A murmur of voices came from the inn, but no answer whatever to the  demand.  The building, glaring white as a rock rolled into the plains  from the great mountains to the north, had a little bush of juniper  thrust out on a staff above its door.  It looked like a dry tongue  protruded in derision, and awoke the demon in Messer Lanti.  He turned  to a Page:--'Ercole!' he roared, pointing; 'set a light there, and give  these hinds a lesson!'    The lady laughed, and, stirring a little, watched the page curiously.  But the boy had scarcely reached the ground when the landlord appeared  bowing at the door. The cavalier fumed.    'Ciacco--hog!' he thundered: 'did you not hear us call?'    'Illustrious, no.'    'Where were your ears?  Nailed to the pillory?'    'Nay, Magnificent, but to the utterances of the little Parablist of San  Zeno.'    'O hog! now by the Mass, I say, they had been better pricked to thy  business.  O ciacco, I tell thee thy Parablist was like, in another  moment, to have addressed thee out of a burning bush.  What!  I would  drink, swine!  And, harkee, somewhere from those deep vats of thine the  perfume of an old wine of Cana rises to my nostrils.  I say no more.  Despatch!'    The landlord, abasing himself outwardly, took solace of a private curse  as he turned into the shadow of his porch--    'These skipjacks of the Sforzas! limbs of a country churl!'    Something lithe and gripping sprang upon his back as he muttered, making  him roar out; and the chirrup of a great cricket shrilled in his ear--    'Biting limbs! clawing, hooking, scoring limbs! ha-ha, hee-hee,  ho-bir-r-r-r!'    Boniface, sweating with panic, wriggled to shake off his incubus.  It  clung to him toe and claw.  Slewing his gross head, he saw, squatted  upon his shoulders, a manikin in green livery, a monstrous grasshopper  in seeming.    'Messer Fool,' he gurgled--'dear my lord's most honoured jester!' (he  was essaying all the time to stagger with his burden out of  earshot)--'prithee spare to damn a poor fellow for a hasty word under  provocation! Prithee, sweet Messer Fool!'    The little creature, sitting him as a frog a pike, hooked its small  talons into the corners of his eyes.    'Provocation!' it laughed, rocking--'provocation by his grandness to a  guts!  If I fail to baste thee on a spit for it, call me not Cicada!'    'Mercy!' implored the landlord, staggering and groping.    'Nothing for nothing.  At what price, tunbelly?'    The landlord clutched in his blindness at the post of a descending  stair.    'The best in my house.'    'What best, paunch?'    'Milan cheese--boiled bacon.  Ah, dear Messer Cicada, there is a fat  cold capon, for which I will go fasting to thee.'    'And what wine, beast?'    'What thou wilt, indeed.'    The jester spurred him with a vicious heel.    'Away, then!  Sink, submerge, titubate, and evanish into thy crystal  vaults!'    'Alas, I cannot see!'    The rider shifted his clutch to the fat jowls of his victim, who  thereupon, with a groan, descended a rude flight of steps at a run, and  brought up with his burden in a cool grotto.  Here were casks and  stoppered jars innumerable; shelves of deep blue flasks; lolling  amphorae, and festoons of cobwebs drunk with must. Cicada leapt with one  spring to a barrel, on which he squatted, rather now like a green frog  than a grasshopper. His face, lean and leathery, looked as if dipped in  a tan-pit; his eyes were as aspish as his tongue; he was a stunted,  grotesque little creature, all vice and whipcord.    'Despatch!' he shrilled.  'Thy wit is less a desert than my throat.'    'Anon!' mumbled the landlord, and hurried for a flask.  'Let thy tongue  roll on that,' he said, 'and call me grateful.  As to the capon,  prithee, for my bones' sake, let me serve thy masters first.'    The jester had already the flask at his mouth.  The wine sank into him  as into hot sand.    'Go,' he said, stopping a moment, and bubbling--'go, and damn thy capon;  I ask no grosser aliment than this.'    The landlord, bustling in a restored confidence, filled a great bottle  from a remote jar, and armed with it and some vessels of twisted glass,  mounted to daylight once more.  Messer Lanti, scowling in the sun,  cursed him for a laggard.    'Magnificent!' pleaded the man, 'the sweetest wine, like the sweetest  meat, is near the bone.'    'Deep in the ribs of the cellars, meanest, O, ciacco?'    He took a long draught, and turned to his lady.    'Trust the rogue, Beatrice; it is, indeed, near the marrow of  deliciousness.'    She sipped of her glass delicately, and nodded.  The cavalier held out  his for more.    'Malvasia, hog?'    'Malvasia, most honoured; trod out by the white feet of prettiest  contadina, and much favoured, by the token, of the Abbot of San Zeno  yonder.'    Messer Lanti looked up with a new good-humour. The party was halted in a  great flat basin among hills, on one of the lowest of which, remote and  austere, sparkled the high, white towers of a monastery.    'There,' he said, signifying the spot to his companion with a grin;  'hast heard of Giuseppe della Grande, Beatrice, the _father_ of his  people?'    'And not least of our own little Parablist, Madonna,' put in the  landlord, with a salutation.    'Plague, man!' cried Lanti; 'who the devil is this Parablist you keep  throwing at us?'    'They call him Bernardo Bembo, my lord.  He was dropped and bred among  the monks--some by-blow of a star, they say, in the year of the great  fall.  He was found at the feet of Mary's statue; and, certes, he is  gifted like an angel.  He mouths parables as it were prick-songs, and is  esteemed among all for a saint.'    'A fair saint, i'faith, to be carousing in a tavern.'    'O my lord! he but lies here an hour from the sun, on his way, this very  morning, to Milan, whither he vouches he has had a call.  And for his  carousing, spring water is it all, and the saints to pay, as I know to  my cost.'    'He should have stopped at the rill, methinks.'    'He will stop at nothing,' protested the landlord humbly; 'nay, not even  the rebuking by his parables of our most illustrious lord, the Duke  Galeazzo himself.'    Lanti guffawed.    'Thou talkest treason, dog.  What is to rebuke there?'    'What indeed, Magnificent?  Set a saint, _I_ say, to catch a saint.'    The other laughed louder.    'The right sort of saint for that, I trow, from Giuseppe's loins.'    'Nay, good my lord, the Lord Abbot himself is no less a saint.'    'What!' roared Lanti, 'saints all around!  This is the right hagiolatry,  where I need never despair of a niche for myself.  I too am the son of  my father, dear Messer Ciacco, as this Parablist is, I'll protest, of  your Abbot, whose piety is an old story.  What! you don't recognise a  family likeness?'    The landlord abased himself between deference and roguery.    'It is not for me to say, Magnificent.  I am no expert to prove the  common authorship of this picture and the other.'    He lowered his eyes with a demure leer.  Honest Lanti, bending to rally  him, chuckled loudly, and then, rising, brought his whip with a  boisterous smack across his shoulders.  The landlord jumped and winced.    'Spoken like a discreet son of the Church!' cried the cavalier.    He breathed out his chest, drained his glass, still laughing into it,  and, handing it down, settled himself in his saddle.    'And so,' he said, 'this saintly whelp of a saint is on his way to  rebuke the lord of Sforza?'    'With deference, my lord, like a younger Nathan.  So he hath been  miscalled--I speak nothing from myself. The young man hath lived all his  "]]]
