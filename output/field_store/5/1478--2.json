Robin was a proud outlaw,       While as he walked on the ground.       So courteous an outlaw as he was one       Was never none else found.    In the days of good King Harry the Second of England--he of the warring  sons--there were certain forests in the north country set aside for the  King's hunting, and no man might shoot deer therein under penalty of  death. These forests were guarded by the King's Foresters, the chief  of whom, in each wood, was no mean man but equal in authority to the  Sheriff in his walled town, or even to my lord Bishop in his abbey.    One of the greatest of royal preserves was Sherwood and Barnesdale  forests near the two towns of Nottingham and Barnesdale. Here for some  years dwelt one Hugh Fitzooth as Head Forester, with his good wife and  son Robert. The boy had been born in Lockesley town--in the year 1160,  stern records say--and was often called Lockesley, or Rob of Lockesley.  He was a comely, well-knit stripling, and as soon as he was strong  enough to walk his chief delight was to go with his father into the  forest. As soon as his right arm received thew and sinew he learned to  draw the long bow and speed a true arrow. While on winter evenings his  greatest joy was to hear his father tell of bold Will o' the Green, the  outlaw, who for many summers defied the King's Foresters and feasted  with his men upon King's deer. And on other stormy days the boy learned  to whittle out a straight shaft for the long bow, and tip it with gray  goose feathers.    The fond mother sighed when she saw the boy's face light up at these  woodland tales. She was of gentle birth, and had hoped to see her son  famous at court or abbey. She taught him to read and to write, to doff  his cap without awkwardness and to answer directly and truthfully both  lord and peasant. But the boy, although he took kindly to these lessons  of breeding, was yet happiest when he had his beloved bow in hand and  strolled at will, listening to the murmur of the trees.    Two playmates had Rob in these gladsome early days. One was Will  Gamewell, his father's brother's son, who lived at Gamewell Lodge, hard  by Nottingham town. The other was Marian Fitzwalter, only child of the  Earl of Huntingdon. The castle of Huntingdon could be seen from the top  of one of the tall trees in Sherwood; and on more than one bright day  Rob's white signal from this tree told Marian that he awaited her there:  for you must know that Rob did not visit her at the castle. His father  and her father were enemies. Some people whispered that Hugh Fitzooth  was the rightful Earl of Huntingdon, but that he had been defrauded out  of his lands by Fitzwalter, who had won the King's favor by a crusade to  the Holy Land. But little cared Rob or Marian for this enmity, however  it had arisen. They knew that the great green--wood was open to them,  and that the wide, wide world was full of the scent of flowers and the  song of birds.    Days of youth speed all too swiftly, and troubled skies come all too  soon. Rob's father had two other enemies besides Fitzwalter, in  the persons of the lean Sheriff of Nottingham and the fat Bishop of  Hereford. These three enemies one day got possession of the King's ear  and whispered therein to such good--or evil--purpose that Hugh Fitzooth  was removed from his post of King's Forester. He and his wife and Rob,  then a youth of nineteen, were descended upon, during a cold winter's  evening, and dispossessed without warning. The Sheriff arrested the  Forester for treason--of which, poor man, he was as guiltless as you or  I--and carried him to Nottingham jail. Rob and his mother were sheltered  over night in the jail, also, but next morning were roughly bade to go  about their business. Thereupon they turned for succor to their only  kinsman, Squire George of Gamewell, who sheltered them in all kindness.    But the shock, and the winter night's journey, proved too much for  Dame Fitzooth. She had not been strong for some time before leaving the  forest. In less than two months she was no more. Rob felt as though his  heart was broken at this loss. But scarcely had the first spring flowers  begun to blossom upon her grave, when he met another crushing blow in  the loss of his father. That stern man had died in prison before his  accusers could agree upon the charges by which he was to be brought to  trial.    Two years passed by. Rob's cousin Will was away at school; and Marian's  father, who had learned of her friendship with Rob, had sent his  daughter to the court of Queen Eleanor. So these years were lonely ones  to the orphaned lad. The bluff old Squire was kind to him, but secretly  could make nothing of one who went about brooding and as though seeking  for something he had lost. The truth is that Rob missed his old life  in the forest no less than his mother's gentleness, and his father's  companionship. Every time he twanged the string of the long bow against  his shoulder and heard the gray goose shaft sing, it told him of happy  days that he could not recall.    One morning as Rob came in to breakfast, his uncle greeted him with, \"I  have news for you, Rob, my lad!\" and the hearty old Squire finished his  draught of ale and set his pewter tankard down with a crash.    \"What may that be, Uncle Gamewell?\" asked the young man.    \"Here is a chance to exercise your good long bow and win a pretty prize.  The Fair is on at Nottingham, and the Sheriff proclaims an archer's  tournament. The best fellows are to have places with the King's  Foresters, and the one who shoots straightest of all will win for prize  a golden arrow--a useless bauble enough, but just the thing for your lady  love, eh, Rob my boy?\" Here the Squire laughed and whacked the table  again with his tankard.    Rob's eyes sparkled. \"'Twere indeed worth shooting for, uncle mine,\" he  said. \"I should dearly love to let arrow fly alongside another man. And  a place among the Foresters is what I have long desired. Will you let me  try?\"    \"To be sure,\" rejoined his uncle. \"Well I know that your good mother  would have had me make a clerk of you; but well I see that the greenwood  is where you will pass your days. So, here's luck to you in the bout!\"  And the huge tankard came a third time into play.    The young man thanked his uncle for his good wishes, and set about  making preparations for the journey. He traveled lightly; but his yew  bow must needs have a new string, and his cloth-yard arrows must be of  the straightest and soundest.    One fine morning, a few days after, Rob might have been seen passing  by way of Lockesley through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham town. Briskly  walked he and gaily, for his hopes were high and never an enemy had he  in the wide world. But 'twas the very last morning in all his life  when he was to lack an enemy! For, as he went his way through Sherwood,  whistling a blithe tune, he came suddenly upon a group of Foresters,  making merry beneath the spreading branches of an oak-tree. They had a  huge meat pie before them and were washing down prodigious slices of it  with nut brown ale.    One glance at the leader and Rob knew at once that he had found  an enemy. 'Twas the man who had usurped his father's place as Head  Forester, and who had roughly turned his mother out in the snow. But  never a word said he for good or bad, and would have passed on his way,  had not this man, clearing his throat with a huge gulp, bellowed out:  \"By my troth, here is a pretty little archer! Where go you, my lad, with  that tupenny bow and toy arrows? Belike he would shoot at Nottingham  Fair! Ho! Ho!\"    A roar of laughter greeted this sally. Rob flushed, for he was mightily  proud of his shooting.    \"My bow is as good as yours,\" he retorted, \"and my shafts will carry as  straight and as far. So I'll not take lessons of any of ye.\"    They laughed again loudly at this, and the leader said with frown:    \"Show us some of your skill, and if you can hit the mark here's twenty  silver"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#1)"],[1,"PHOENIX AND THE CARPET    E.

THE EGG      It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a  doubt arose in some breast--Robert's, I fancy--as to the quality of the  fireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration.    'They were jolly cheap,' said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert,  'and suppose they didn't go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would  have something to snigger about then.'    'The ones _I_ got are all right,' Jane said; 'I know they are, because  the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--'    'I'm sure thribble isn't grammar,' Anthea said.    'Of course it isn't,' said Cyril; 'one word can't be grammar all by  itself, so you needn't be so jolly clever.'    Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very  disagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how  the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the  top of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for  not having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on  the mat when they came home from school.    So Anthea only said, 'Don't be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And  the fireworks look all right, and you'll have the eightpence that your  tram fares didn't cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to  get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.'    'I daresay,' said Cyril, coldly; 'but it's not YOUR eightpence anyhow--'    'But look here,' said Robert, 'really now, about the fireworks. We don't  want to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because  they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.'    'I wouldn't wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to be  beheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,' said Anthea, with scorn.    Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the  steadiness with which he can stick.    'I think we ought to test them,' he said.    'You young duffer,' said Cyril, 'fireworks are like postage-stamps. You  can only use them once.'    'What do you suppose it means by \"Carter's tested seeds\" in the  advertisement?'    There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his  finger and shook his head.    'A little wrong here,' he said. 'I was always afraid of that with poor  Robert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so  often--it's bound to tell--'    'Dry up,' said Robert, fiercely. 'Don't you see? You can't TEST seeds if  you do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those  grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you call  it?--Father told me--\"up to sample\". Don't you think we ought to sample  the fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try  them.'    'But it's raining cats and dogs,' said Jane.    'And Queen Anne is dead,' rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good  temper. 'We needn't go out to do them; we can just move back the table,  and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don't  know what YOU think, but _I_ think it's time we did something, and  that would be really useful; because then we shouldn't just HOPE the  fireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.'    'It WOULD be something to do,' Cyril owned with languid approval.    So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that  had been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most  awfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook  wasn't looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole.    Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four  children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped  something. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles;  but Jane's fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the  Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the  party--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declared  that Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of  it was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything  even faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those  of the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a  toss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however  much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out.    'I didn't mean to,' said Jane, near tears. 'I don't care, I'll draw  another--'    'You know jolly well you can't,' said Cyril, bitterly. 'It's settled.  It's Medium and Persian. You've done it, and you'll have to stand by  it--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU'LL have your pocket-money  before the Fifth. Anyway, we'll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get  the most out of it we can.'    So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were  all that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the  Jack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril  said. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with  matches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket  of father's second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then  Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms  and dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice  and like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the  bees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used  for cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She  came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when  it was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long  ago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and  she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was  trying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The  Jack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin  acted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt  up and burnt off Cyril's eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all  four before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous  bounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of  fire reached from floor to ceiling.    'My hat,' said Cyril, with emotion, 'You've done it this time, Anthea.'    The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in  Mr Rider Haggard's exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and  Cyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the  carpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire,  and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful  smell of lamps that have been turned too low.    All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a  bundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their  feet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpet  moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at  last allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate  violence inside the carpet.    Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the  window and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and  Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the  firework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath  the table.    Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a  few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and  the children stood looking at each other's black faces, and, out of the  corners of their eyes, at mother's white one.    The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little  surprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the  immediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to  Rome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure  that many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do.    The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased  when father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said,  'Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?'    You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and  that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that  they all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with  which father handled them.    Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to  be deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be  whitewashed.    And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a"]]]
