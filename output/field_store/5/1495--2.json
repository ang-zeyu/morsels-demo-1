No thorough investigation of this epos can be said  to have appeared in print, anywhere, prior to the publication, in  1913, of the monumental _Synopses of Aryan Mythology_ by Angelo  de Ruiz. It is unnecessary to observe that in this exhaustive digest  Professor de Ruiz has given (VII, p. 415 _et sequentia_) a  summary of the greater part of these legends as contained in the  collections of Verville and Buelg; and has discussed at length and  with much learning the esoteric meaning of these folk-stories and  their bearing upon questions to which the \"solar theory\" of myth  explanation has given rise. To his volumes, and to the pages of Mr.  Lewistam's _Key to the Popular Tales of Poictesme_, must be  referred all those who may elect to think of Jurgen as the  resplendent, journeying and procreative sun.    Equally in reading hereinafter will the judicious waive all  allegorical interpretation, if merely because the suggestions  hitherto advanced are inconveniently various. Thus Verville  finds the Nessus shirt a symbol of retribution, where Buelg,  with rather wide divergence, would have it represent the dangerous  gift of genius. Then it may be remembered that Dr. Codman says,  without any hesitancy, of Mother Sereda: \"This Mother Middle is  the world generally (an obvious anagram of _Erda es_), and this  Sereda rules not merely the middle of the working-days but the  midst of everything. She is the factor of _middleness_, of  mediocrity, of an avoidance of extremes, of the eternal compromise  begotten by use and wont. She is the Mrs. Grundy of the Leshy; she is  Comstockery: and her shadow is common-sense.\" Yet Codman speaks with  certainly no more authority than Prote, when the latter, in his  _Origins of Fable_, declares this epos is \"a parable of ... man's  vain journeying in search of that rationality and justice which his  nature craves, and discovers nowhere in the universe: and the shirt  is an emblem of this instinctive craving, as ... the shadow symbolizes  conscience. Sereda typifies a surrender to life as it is, a giving up  of man's rebellious self-centredness and selfishness: the anagram being  _se dare_.\"    Thus do interpretations throng and clash, and neatly equal the  commentators in number. Yet possibly each one of these unriddlings,  with no doubt a host of others, is conceivable: so that wisdom will  dwell upon none of them very seriously.    With the origin and the occult meaning of the folklore of Poictesme  this book at least is in no wise concerned: its unambitious aim has  been merely to familiarize English readers with the Jurgen epos for  the tale's sake. And this tale of old years is one which, by rare  fortune, can be given to English readers almost unabridged, in view  of the singular delicacy and pure-mindedness of the Jurgen mythos:  in all, not more than a half-dozen deletions have seemed expedient  (and have been duly indicated) in order to remove such sparse and  unimportant outcroppings of mediaeval frankness as might conceivably  offend the squeamish.    Since this volume is presented simply as a story to be read for  pastime, neither morality nor symbolism is hereinafter educed, and  no \"parallels\" and \"authorities\" are quoted. Even the gaps are left  unbridged by guesswork: whereas the historic and mythological  problems perhaps involved are relinquished to those really  thoroughgoing scholars whom erudition qualifies to deal with such  topics, and tedium does not deter....    In such terms, and thus far, ran the Foreword to the first issues of  this book, whose later fortunes have made necessary the lengthening  of the Foreword with a postscript. The needed addition--this much at  least chiming with good luck--is brief. It is just that fragment  which some scholars, since the first appearance of this volume, have  asserted--upon what perfect frankness must describe as not  indisputable grounds--to be a portion of the thirty-second chapter  of the complete form of _La Haulte Histoire de Jurgen_.    And in reply to what these scholars assert, discretion says nothing.  For this fragment was, of course, unknown when the High History was  first put into English, and there in consequence appears, here,  little to be won either by endorsing or denying its claims to  authenticity. Rather, does discretion prompt the appending, without  any gloss or scholia, of this fragment, which deals with        _The Judging of Jurgen._    Now a court was held by the Philistines to decide whether or no King  Jurgen should be relegated to limbo. And when the judges were  prepared for judging, there came into the court a great tumblebug,  rolling in front of him his loved and properly housed young ones.  With the creature came pages, in black and white, bearing a sword, a  staff and a lance.    This insect looked at Jurgen, and its pincers rose erect in horror.  The bug cried to the three judges, \"Now, by St. Anthony! this Jurgen  must forthwith be relegated to limbo, for he is offensive and lewd  and lascivious and indecent.\"    \"And how can that be?\" says Jurgen.    \"You are offensive,\" the bug replied, \"because this page has a sword  which I choose to say is not a sword. You are lewd because that page  has a lance which I prefer to think is not a lance. You are  lascivious because yonder page has a staff which I elect to declare  is not a staff. And finally, you are indecent for reasons of which a  description would be objectionable to me, and which therefore I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

CARY, M.A.            HELL          Cantos 1 - 34        CANTO I      IN the midway of this our mortal life,  I found me in a gloomy wood, astray  Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell  It were no easy task, how savage wild  That forest, how robust and rough its growth,  Which to remember only, my dismay  Renews, in bitterness not far from death.  Yet to discourse of what there good befell,  All else will I relate discover'd there.  How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,  Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd  My senses down, when the true path I left,  But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd  The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,  I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad  Already vested with that planet's beam,  Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.    Then was a little respite to the fear,  That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,  All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:  And as a man, with difficult short breath,  Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,  Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands  At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd  Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,  That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame  After short pause recomforted, again  I journey'd on over that lonely steep,    The hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent  Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,  And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,  Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove  To check my onward going; that ofttimes  With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.    The hour was morning's prime, and on his way  Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,  That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd  Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope  All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin  Of that swift animal, the matin dawn  And the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas'd,  And by new dread succeeded, when in view  A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,    With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,  That e'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf  Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd  Full of all wants, and many a land hath made  Disconsolate ere now.  She with such fear  O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,  That of the height all hope I lost.  As one,  Who with his gain elated, sees the time  When all unwares is gone, he inwardly  Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,  Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,  Who coming o'er against me, by degrees  Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.    While to the lower space with backward step  I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,  Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.  When him in that great desert I espied,  \"Have mercy on me!\" cried I out aloud,  \"Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!\"    He answer'd: \"Now not man, man once I was,  And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both  By country, when the power of Julius yet  Was scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past  Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time  Of fabled deities and false.  A bard  Was I, and made Anchises' upright son  The subject of my song, who came from Troy,  When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.  But thou, say wherefore to such perils past  Return'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount  Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?\"  \"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,  From which such copious floods of eloquence  Have issued?\"  I with front abash'd replied.  \"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!  May it avail me that I long with zeal  Have sought thy volume, and with love immense  Have conn'd it o'er.  My master thou and guide!  Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd  That style, which for its beauty into fame  Exalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled.  O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!\"    \"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame  She hath made tremble.\"  He, soon as he saw  That I was weeping, answer'd, \"Thou must needs  Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape  From out that savage wilderness.  This beast,  At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none  To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:  So bad and so accursed in her kind,  That never sated is her ravenous will,  Still after food more craving than before.  To many an animal in wedlock vile  She fastens, and shall yet to many more,  Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy  Her with sharp pain.  He will not life support  By earth nor its base metals, but by love,  Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be  The land 'twixt either Feltro.  In his might  Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,  For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,  Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.  He with incessant chase through every town  Shall worry, until he to hell at length  Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.  I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,  That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide  Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,  Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see  Spirits of old tormented, who invoke  A second death; and those next view, who dwell  Content in fire, for that they hope to come,  Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,  Into whose regions if thou then desire  T' ascend, a spirit worthier than I  Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,  Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,  Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,  Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,  That to his city none through me should come.  He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds  His citadel and throne.  O happy those,  Whom there he chooses!\"  I to him in few:  \"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,  I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse  I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,  That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those  Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight.\"    Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.          CANTO II    NOW was the day departing, and the air,  Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd  All animals on earth; and I alone  Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,  Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,  Which my unerring memory shall retrace.    O Muses!  O high genius! now vouchsafe  Your aid!  O mind! that all I saw hast kept  Safe in a written record, here thy worth  And eminent endowments come to proof.    I thus began: \"Bard! thou who art my guide,  Consider well, if virtue be in me  Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise  Thou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,  Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among  Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there  Sensible present.  Yet if heaven's great Lord,  Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,  In contemplation of the high effect,  Both what and who from him should issue forth,  It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:  Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,  In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:  Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd  And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits  Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.  He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,  Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise  And to the papal robe.  In after-times  The chosen vessel also travel'd there,  To bring us back assurance in that faith,  Which is the entrance to salvation's way.  But I, why should I there presume?  or who  Permits it?  not Aeneas I nor Paul.  Myself I deem not worthy, and none else  Will deem me.  I, if on this voyage then  I venture, fear it will in folly end.  Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,  Than I can speak.\"  As one, who unresolves  What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts  Changes his purpose, from his first intent  Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,  Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first  So eagerly embrac'd.  \"If right thy words  I scan,\" replied that shade magnanimous,  \"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft  So overcasts a man, that he recoils  From noblest resolution, like a beast  At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.  That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,  I will instruct thee why I came, and what  I heard in that same instant, when for thee  Grief touch'd me first.  I was among the tribe,  Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest  And lovely, I besought her to command,  Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star  Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft  Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:  \"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame  Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!  A friend, not of my fortune but myself,  On the wide desert in his road has met  Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.  Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,  And I be ris'n too late for his relief,  From what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,  And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,  And by all means for his deliverance meet,  Assist him.  So to me will comfort spring.  I who now bid thee on this errand forth  Am Beatrice; from a place I come    (Note: Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is  pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four  syllables, of which the third is a long one.)    Revisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,  Who prompts my speech.  When in my Master's sight  I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.\"    She then was silent, and I thus began:  \"O Lady! by whose influence alone,  Mankind excels whatever is contain'd  Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,  So thy command delights me, that to obey,  If it were done already, would seem late.  No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;  Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth  To leave that ample space, where to return  Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.\"    She then: \"Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,  I will instruct thee briefly,"]]]
