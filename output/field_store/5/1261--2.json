Exposition of the Myth of Providence.--Retrogression of God        INTRODUCTION.    Before entering upon the subject-matter of these new memoirs, I  must explain an hypothesis which will undoubtedly seem strange,  but in the absence of which it is impossible for me to proceed  intelligibly: I mean the hypothesis of a God.    To suppose God, it will be said, is to deny him.  Why do you not  affirm him?    Is it my fault if belief in Divinity has become a suspected  opinion; if the bare suspicion of a Supreme Being is already  noted as evidence of a weak mind; and if, of all philosophical  Utopias, this is the only one which the world no longer  tolerates?  Is it my fault if hypocrisy and imbecility everywhere  hide behind this holy formula?    Let a public teacher suppose the existence, in the universe, of  an unknown force governing suns and atoms, and keeping the whole  machine in motion.  With him this supposition, wholly gratuitous,  is perfectly natural; it is received, encouraged: witness  attraction--an hypothesis which will never be verified, and  which, nevertheless, is the glory of its originator.  But when,  to explain the course of human events, I suppose, with all  imaginable caution, the intervention of a God, I am sure to shock  scientific gravity and offend critical ears: to so wonderful an  extent has our piety discredited Providence, so many tricks  have been played by means of this dogma or fiction by charlatans  of every stamp!  I have seen the theists of my time, and  blasphemy has played over my lips; I have studied the belief of  the people,--this people that Brydaine called the best friend of  God,--and have shuddered at the negation which was about to  escape me.  Tormented by conflicting feelings, I appealed to  reason; and it is reason which, amid so many dogmatic  contradictions, now forces the hypothesis upon me.  A priori  dogmatism, applying itself to God, has proved fruitless: who  knows whither the hypothesis, in its turn, will lead us?    I will explain therefore how, studying in the silence of my  heart, and far from every human consideration, the mystery of  social revolutions, God, the great unknown, has become for me an  hypothesis,--I mean a necessary dialectical tool.        I.    If I follow the God-idea through its successive transformations,  I find that this idea is preeminently social: I mean by this that  it is much more a collective act of faith than an individual  conception.  Now, how and under what circumstances is this act of  faith produced?  This point it is important to determine.    From the moral and intellectual point of view, society, or the  collective man, is especially distinguished from the individual  by spontaneity of action,--in other words, instinct.  While the  individual obeys, or imagines he obeys, only those motives of  which he is fully conscious, and upon which he can at will  decline or consent to act; while, in a word, he thinks himself  free, and all the freer when he knows that he is possessed of  keener reasoning faculties and larger information,--society is  governed by impulses which, at first blush, exhibit no  deliberation and design, but which gradually seem to be directed  by a superior power, existing outside of society, and pushing it  with irresistible might toward an unknown goal.  The  establishment of monarchies and republics, caste-distinctions,  judicial institutions, etc., are so many manifestations of this  social spontaneity, to note the effects of which is much easier  than to point out its principle and show its cause.  The whole  effort, even of those who, following Bossuet, Vico, Herder,  Hegel, have applied themselves to the philosophy of history, has  been hitherto to establish the presence of a providential destiny  presiding over all the movements of man.  And I observe, in this  connection, that society never fails to evoke its genius previous  to action: as if it wished the powers above to ordain what its  own spontaneity has already resolved on.  Lots, oracles,  sacrifices, popular acclamation, public prayers, are the  commonest forms of these tardy deliberations of society.    This mysterious faculty, wholly intuitive, and, so to speak,  super-social, scarcely or not at all perceptible in persons, but  which hovers over humanity like an inspiring genius, is the  primordial fact of all psychology.    Now, unlike other species of animals, which, like him, are  governed at the same time by individual desires and collective  impulses, man has the privilege of perceiving and designating to  his own mind the instinct or fatum which leads him; we shall see  later that he has also the power of foreseeing and even  influencing its decrees.  And the first act of man, filled and  carried away with enthusiasm (of the divine breath), is to adore  the invisible Providence on which he feels that he depends, and  which he calls GOD,--that is, Life, Being, Spirit, or, simpler  still, Me; for all these words, in the ancient tongues, are  synonyms and homophones.  \"I am ME,\" God said to Abraham,  \"and I covenant with THEE.\"....  And to Moses:  \"I am the Being.  Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, `The Being hath sent  me unto you.'\"  These two words, the Being and Me, have in the  original language--the most religious that men have ever  spoken--the same characteristic.[1]  Elsewhere, when Ie-hovah,  acting as law-giver through the instrumentality of Moses, attests  his eternity and swears by his own essence, he uses, as a form of  oath, _I_; or else, with redoubled force, _I_, THE BEING.  Thus  the God of the Hebrews is the most personal and wilful of all the  gods, and none express better than he the intuition of humanity.      [1] Ie-hovah, and in composition Iah, the Being; Iao, ioupitur,  same meaning; ha-iah, Heb., he was; ei, Gr., he is, ei-nai, to  be; an-i, Heb., and in conjugation th-i, me; e-go, io, ich, i,  m-i, me, t-ibi, te, and all the personal pronouns in which the  vowels i, e, ei, oi, denote personality in general, and the  consonants, m or n, s or t, serve to indicate the number of the  person.  For the rest, let who will dispute over these analogies;  I have no objections: at this depth, the science of the  philologist is but cloud and mystery.  The important point to  which I wish to call attention is that the phonetic relation of  names seems to correspond to the metaphysical relation of ideas.        God appeared to man, then, as a me, as a pure and permanent  essence, placing himself before him as a monarch before his  servant, and expressing himself now through the mouth of poets,  legislators, and soothsayers, musa, nomos, numen; now through the  popular voice, vox populi vox Dei.  This may serve, among other  things, to explain the existence of true and false oracles; why  individuals secluded from birth do not attain of themselves to  the idea of God, while they eagerly grasp it as soon as it is  presented to them by the collective mind; why, finally,  stationary races, like the Chinese, end by losing it.[2]  In the  first place, as to oracles, it is clear that all their  accuracy depends upon the universal conscience which inspires  them; and, as to the idea of God, it is easily seen why isolation  and statu quo are alike fatal to it.  On the one hand, absence of  communication keeps the mind absorbed in animal  self-contemplation; on the other, absence of motion, gradually  changing social life into mechanical routine, finally eliminates  the idea of will and providence.  Strange fact! religion, which  perishes through progress, perishes also through quiescence.      [2] The Chinese have preserved in their traditions the  remembrance of a religion which had ceased to exist among them  five or six centuries before our era.

RIVERSIDE, CAMBRIDGE:       STEREOTYPED AND PRINTED BY       H. O. HOUGHTON AND COMPANY.          PREFACE.      No apology is offered for presenting to the public the only authentic  account of Brigham Young, of his polygamous family, and of that  complicated and incongruous system of social and political machinery,  called Mormonism.    The only form of religion in this country which refuses to conform  either to the spirit of progress and improvement and enlightened  humanity which characterizes the age in which we live, or to our laws  and the genius of our free institutions,--drawing constantly from  foreign countries hosts of votaries, impelled hither _not_ by a love of  republicanism, but rather by a desire to exchange a political for a  religious monarchy,--is Mormonism, which presents an antagonism to our  Government, and can scarcely fail to result in national trouble.    The elements of a second rebellion are in active progress in Utah, and,  as in the case of the slavery rebellion, the great danger lies in  failing to place a proper estimate upon the power of those elements for  mischief, and to take the proper precautions in time. Religious  fanaticism is more active, and, when hostile, more dangerous, than  political ambition; hence the arrogant and intolerant spirit, and the  bitter hostility of the Mormons, are more worthy the serious attention  of our statesmen than would be the opposition of so many mere political  traitors.    Again; their power for mischief is much increased by the position they  occupy upon the great thoroughfare between the eastern and western  portions of our country.    It is with the view of calling the attention of the Government and of  the people of the country to the dangerous character of this monarchy  growing up in the midst of the Republic, that the political history of  Utah has been written.    The chief interest of the work, however, with a large class of readers,  will doubtless consist in the information it contains, relative to the  family and social relations of the celebrated Mormon leader. These, and  all other facts contained in this volume, may be relied upon as true,  and many of them are now published for the first time.    The subject of polygamy is treated thoroughly, and as dispassionately as  the writer's utter abhorrence of the system will permit. A residence of  two years in the midst of this state of society, could not fail to  afford me a tolerably good view of its inside workings, and this view I  have presented to my readers.    Some of the facts narrated in this volume have been furnished by persons  in Salt Lake, who are thoroughly conversant with them; in some cases, by  persons who have long been in the service of Young, and know whereof  they relate. While I am not at liberty to mention their names, I take  this opportunity to return them my thanks for such valuable information.    This book is believed to be a desideratum demanded by the social and  political well-being of the country, and as such it is presented to the  consideration of the people of this country, and especially to my own  sex, who are deeply interested in preventing the framework of our social  system from being broken up and superseded by the customs and maxims of  the worst ages of barbarism.    To the suffering women of Utah, I especially dedicate this result of my  labors in their behalf; and I am not without hope that many of them may,  upon a perusal of its pages, be induced to retrace their steps, and  rescue themselves from the snares of the religious impostors now seeking  their destruction.
