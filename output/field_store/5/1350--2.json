The \"Bride of the Nile\" needs no preface. For the professional student I  may observe that I have relied on the authority of de Goeje in adhering  to my own original opinion that the word Mukaukas is not to be regarded  as a name but as a title, since the Arab writers to which I have made  reference apply it to the responsible representatives of the Byzantine  Emperor in antagonism to the Moslem power. I was unfortunately unable to  make further use of Karabacek's researches as to the Mukaukas.    I shall not be held justified in placing the ancient Horus Apollo  (Horapollo) in the seventh century after Christ by any one who  regards the author of the Hieroglyphica as identical with the Egyptian  philosopher of the same name who, according to Suidas, lived under  Theodosius, and to whom Stephanus of Byzantium refers, writing so  early as at the end of the fifth century. But the lexicographer Suidas  enumerates the works of Horapollo, the philologer and commentator  on Greek poetry, without naming the Hieroglyphica, which is the only  treatise alluded to by Stephanus. Besides, all the other ancient writers  who mention Horapollo at all leave us quite free to suppose that there  may have been two sages of the same name--as does C. Leemans, who is  most intimately versed in the Hieroglyphica--and the second certainly  cannot have lived earlier than the VIIth century, since an accurate  knowledge of hieroglyphic writing must have been lost far more  completely in his time than we can suppose possible in the IVth century.  It must be remembered that we still possess well-executed hieroglyphic  inscriptions dating from the time of Decius, 250 years after Christ.  Thus the Egyptian commentator on Greek poetry could hardly have needed a  translator, whereas the Hieroglyphica seems to have been first rendered  into Greek by Philippus. The combination by which the author called  in Egyptian Horus (the son of Isis) is supposed to have been born in  Philae, where the cultus of the Egyptian heathen was longest practised,  and where some familiarity with hieroglyphics must have been preserved  to a late date, takes into due account the real state of affairs at the  period I have selected for my story.                           GEORG EBERS.     October 1st, 1886.            BOOK 1.          CHAPTER I.    Half a lustrum had elapsed since Egypt had become subject to the  youthful power of the Arabs, which had risen with such unexampled vigor  and rapidity. It had fallen an easy prey, cheaply bought, into the  hands of a small, well-captained troop of Moslem warriors; and the fair  province, which so lately had been a jewel of the Byzantine Empire and  the most faithful foster-mother to Christianity, now owned the sway of  the Khalif Omar and saw the Crescent raised by the side of the Cross.    It was long since a hotter season had afflicted the land; and the Nile,  whose rising had been watched for on the Night of Dropping--the 17th of  June--with the usual festive preparations, had cheated the hopes of the  Egyptians, and instead of rising had shrunk narrower and still narrower  in its bed.--It was in this time of sore anxiety, on the 10th of July,  A.D. 643, that a caravan from the North reached Memphis.    It was but a small one; but its appearance in the decayed and deserted  city of the Pyramids--which had grown only lengthwise, like a huge  reed-leaf, since its breadth was confined between the Nile and the  Libyan Hills--attracted the gaze of the passers-by, though in former  years a Memphite would scarcely have thought it worth while to turn his  head to gaze at an interminable pile of wagons loaded with merchandise,  an imposing train of vehicles drawn by oxen, the flashing maniples of  the imperial cavalry, or an endless procession wending its way down the  five miles of high street.    The merchant who, riding a dromedary of the choicest breed, conducted  this caravan, was a lean Moslem of mature age, robed in soft silk. A  vast turban covered his small head and cast a shadow over his delicate  and venerable features.    The Egyptian guide who rode on a brisk little ass by his side, looked  up frequently and with evident pleasure at the merchant's face--not in  itself a handsome one with its hollow cheeks, meagre beard and large  aquiline nose--for it was lighted up by a pair of bright eyes, full  of attractive thoughtfulness and genuine kindness. But that this  fragile-looking man, in whose benevolent countenance grief and  infirmities had graven many a furrow, could not only command but compel  submission was legible alike in his thin, firmly-closed lips and in the  zeal with which his following of truculent and bearded fighting men,  armed to the teeth, obeyed his slightest sign.    His Egyptian attendant, the head of the Hermeneutai--the guild of the  Dragomans of that period--was a swarthy and surly native of Memphis;  whenever he accidentally came too close to the fierce-looking riders of  the dromedaries he shrunk his shoulders as if he expected a blow or a  push, while he poured out question and answer to the Merchant Haschim,  the owner of the caravan, without timidity and with the voluble  garrulity of his tribe.    \"You seem very much at home here in Memphis,\" he observed, when the old  man had expressed his surprise at the decadence and melancholy change in  the city.    \"Thirty years ago,\" replied the merchant, \"my business often brought me  hither. How many houses are now empty and in ruins where formerly only  heavy coin could secure admittance! Ruins on all sides!--Who has so  cruelly mutilated that fine church? My fellow-believers left every  Christian fane untouched--that I know from our chief Amru himself.\"    \"It was the principal church of the Melchites, the Emperor's minions,\"  cried the guide, as if that were ample explanation of the fact. The  merchant, however, did not take it so.    \"Well,\" he said, \"and what is there so dreadful in their creed?\"    \"What?\" said the Egyptian, and his eye flashed wrathfully. \"What?--They  dismember the divine person of the Saviour and attribute to it two  distinct natures. And then!--All the Greeks settled here, and encouraged  by the protection of the emperor, treated us, the owners of the land,  like slaves, till your nation came to put an end to their oppression.  They drove us by force into their churches, and every true-born Egyptian  was punished as a rebel and a leper. They mocked at us and persecuted us  for our faith in the one divine nature of our Lord.\"    \"And so,\" interrupted the merchant, \"as soon as we drove out the  Greeks you behaved more unmercifully to them and their sanctuaries than  we--whom you scorn as infidels--did to you!\"    \"Mercy?--for them!\" cried the Egyptian indignantly, as he cast an evil  eye on the demolished edifice. \"They have reaped what they sowed; and  now every one in Egypt who does not believe in your One God--blessed be  the Saviour!--confesses the one sole nature of our Lord Jesus Christ.  You drove out the Melchite rabble, and then it was our part to demolish  the temples of their wretched Saviour, who lost His divine Unity at the  synod of Chalcedon--damnation wait upon it!\"    \"But still the Melchites are fellow-believers with you--they are  Christians,\" said the merchant.    \"Christians?\" echoed the guide with a contemptuous shrug. \"They may  regard themselves as Christians; but I, with every one else great and  small in this land, am of opinion that they have no right whatever to  call themselves our fellow-believers and Christians. They all are  and shall be for ever accursed with their hundreds--nay thousands of  devilish heresies, by which they degrade our God and Redeemer to the  level of that idol on the stone pillar. Half a cow and half a man! Why,  what rational being, I ask you, could pray to such a mongrel thing? We  Jacobites or Monophysites or whatever they choose to call us will not  yield a jot or tittle of the divine nature of our Lord and Saviour; and  if the old faith must die out, I will turn Moslem and be converted  to your One Omnipotent God; for before I confess the heresies of the  Melchites I will be hewn in pieces, and my wife and children with me.  Who knows what may be coming to pass? And there are many advantages in  going over to your side: for the power is in your hands, and long may  you keep it! We have got to be ruled by strangers; and who would not  rather pay small tribute to the wise and healthy Khalif at Medina than  a heavy one to the sickly imperial brood of Melchites at Constantinople.  The Mukaukas George, to be sure, is not a bad sort of man, and as he so  soon gave up all idea of resisting you he was no doubt of my opinion.  Regarding you as just and pious folks, as our next neighbors, and  perhaps even of our own race and blood, he preferred you--my brother  told me so--to those Byzantine heretics, flayers of men and thirsting  for blood, but yet, the Mukaukas is as good a Christian as breathes.\"    The Arab had listened attentively and with a subtle smile to the  Memphite, whose duties as guide now compelled him to break off. The  Egyptian made the whole caravan turn down an alley that led into a  street running parallel to the river, where a few fine houses still  stood in the midst of their gardens. When men and beasts were making  their way along a better pavement the merchant observed: \"I knew the  father of the man you were speaking of, very well. He was wealthy  and virtuous; of his son too I hear nothing but good. But is he  still allowed to bear the title of governor, or, what did you call  him?--Mukaukas?\"    \"Certainly, Master,\" said the guide. \"There is no older family than his  in all Egypt, and if old Menas was rich the Mukaukas is richer, both  by inheritance and by his wife's dower. Nor could we wish for a more  sensible or a juster governor!

J.B.            PART I        CHAPTER ONE    The Wicket-Gate    I spent one-third of my journey looking out of the window of a  first-class carriage, the next in a local motor-car following the  course of a trout stream in a shallow valley, and the last tramping  over a ridge of downland through great beech-woods to my quarters for  the night. In the first part I was in an infamous temper; in the second  I was worried and mystified; but the cool twilight of the third stage  calmed and heartened me, and I reached the gates of Fosse Manor with a  mighty appetite and a quiet mind.    As we slipped up the Thames valley on the smooth Great Western line I  had reflected ruefully on the thorns in the path of duty. For more than  a year I had never been out of khaki, except the months I spent in  hospital. They gave me my battalion before the Somme, and I came out of  that weary battle after the first big September fighting with a crack  in my head and a D.S.O. I had received a C.B. for the Erzerum business,  so what with these and my Matabele and South African medals and the  Legion of Honour, I had a chest like the High Priest's breastplate. I  rejoined in January, and got a brigade on the eve of Arras. There we  had a star turn, and took about as many prisoners as we put infantry  over the top. After that we were hauled out for a month, and  subsequently planted in a bad bit on the Scarpe with a hint that we  would soon be used for a big push. Then suddenly I was ordered home to  report to the War Office, and passed on by them to Bullivant and his  merry men. So here I was sitting in a railway carriage in a grey tweed  suit, with a neat new suitcase on the rack labelled C.B. The initials  stood for Cornelius Brand, for that was my name now. And an old boy in  the corner was asking me questions and wondering audibly why I wasn't  fighting, while a young blood of a second lieutenant with a wound  stripe was eyeing me with scorn.    The old chap was one of the cross-examining type, and after he had  borrowed my matches he set to work to find out all about me. He was a  tremendous fire-eater, and a bit of a pessimist about our slow progress  in the west. I told him I came from South Africa and was a mining  engineer.    'Been fighting with Botha?' he asked.    'No,' I said. 'I'm not the fighting kind.'    The second lieutenant screwed up his nose.    'Is there no conscription in South Africa?'    'Thank God there isn't,' I said, and the old fellow begged permission  to tell me a lot of unpalatable things. I knew his kind and didn't give  much for it. He was the sort who, if he had been under fifty, would  have crawled on his belly to his tribunal to get exempted, but being  over age was able to pose as a patriot. But I didn't like the second  lieutenant's grin, for he seemed a good class of lad. I looked steadily  out of the window for the rest of the way, and wasn't sorry when I got  to my station.    I had had the queerest interview with Bullivant and Macgillivray. They  asked me first if I was willing to serve again in the old game, and I  said I was. I felt as bitter as sin, for I had got fixed in the  military groove, and had made good there. Here was I--a brigadier and  still under forty, and with another year of the war there was no saying  where I might end. I had started out without any ambition, only a great  wish to see the business finished. But now I had acquired a  professional interest in the thing, I had a nailing good brigade, and I  had got the hang of our new kind of war as well as any fellow from  Sandhurst and Camberley. They were asking me to scrap all I had learned  and start again in a new job. I had to agree, for discipline's  discipline, but I could have knocked their heads together in my  vexation.    What was worse they wouldn't, or couldn't, tell me anything about what  they wanted me for. It was the old game of running me in blinkers. They  asked me to take it on trust and put myself unreservedly in their  hands. I would get my instructions later, they said.    I asked if it was important.    Bullivant narrowed his eyes. 'If it weren't, do you suppose we could  have wrung an active brigadier out of the War Office? As it was, it was  like drawing teeth.'    'Is it risky?' was my next question.    'In the long run--damnably,' was the answer.    'And you can't tell me anything more?'    'Nothing as yet. You'll get your instructions soon enough. You know  both of us, Hannay, and you know we wouldn't waste the time of a good  man on folly. We are going to ask you for something which will make a  big call on your patriotism. It will be a difficult and arduous task,  and it may be a very grim one before you get to the end of it, but we  believe you can do it, and that no one else can ... You know us pretty  well. Will you let us judge for you?'    I looked at Bullivant's shrewd, kind old face and Macgillivray's steady  eyes. These men were my friends and wouldn't play with Me.    'All right,' I said. 'I'm willing. What's the first step?'    'Get out of uniform and forget you ever were a soldier. Change your  name. Your old one, Cornelis Brandt, will do, but you'd better spell it  \"Brand\" this time. Remember that you are an engineer just back from  South Africa, and that you don't care a rush about the war. You can't  understand what all the fools are fighting about, and you think we  might have peace at once by a little friendly business talk. You  needn't be pro-German--if you like you can be rather severe on the Hun.  But you must be in deadly earnest about a speedy peace.'    I expect the corners of my mouth fell, for Bullivant burst out laughing.    'Hang it all, man, it's not so difficult. I feel sometimes inclined to  argue that way myself, when my dinner doesn't agree with me. It's not  so hard as to wander round the Fatherland abusing Britain, which was  your last job.'    'I'm ready,' I said. 'But I want to do one errand on my own first. I  must see a fellow in my brigade who is in a shell-shock hospital in the  Cotswolds. Isham's the name of the place.'    The two men exchanged glances. 'This looks like fate,' said Bullivant.  'By all means go to Isham. The place where your work begins is only a  couple of miles off. I want you to spend next Thursday night as the  guest of two maiden ladies called Wymondham at Fosse Manor. You will go  down there as a lone South African visiting a sick friend. They are  hospitable souls and entertain many angels unawares.'    'And I get my orders there?'    'You get your orders, and you are under bond to obey them.' And  Bullivant and Macgillivray smiled at each other.    I was thinking hard about that odd conversation as the small Ford car,  which I had wired for to the inn, carried me away from the suburbs of  the county town into a land of rolling hills and green water-meadows.  It was a gorgeous afternoon and the blossom of early June was on every  tree. But I had no eyes for landscape and the summer, being engaged in  reprobating Bullivant and cursing my fantastic fate. I detested my new  part and looked forward to naked shame. It was bad enough for anyone to  have to pose as a pacifist, but for me, strong as a bull and as  sunburnt as a gipsy and not looking my forty years, it was a black  disgrace. To go into Germany as an anti-British Afrikander was a  stoutish adventure, but to lounge about at home talking rot was a very  different-sized job. My stomach rose at the thought of it, and I had  pretty well decided to wire to Bullivant and cry off. There are some  things that no one has a right to ask of any white man.    When I got to Isham and found poor old Blaikie I didn't feel happier.  He had been a friend of mine in Rhodesia, and after the German  South-West affair was over had come home to a Fusilier battalion, which  was in my brigade at Arras. He had been buried by a big crump just  before we got our second objective, and was dug out without a scratch  on him, but as daft as a hatter. I had heard he was mending, and had  promised his family to look him up the first chance I got. I found him  sitting on a garden seat, staring steadily before him like a lookout at  sea. He knew me all right and cheered up for a second, but very soon he  was back at his staring, and every word he uttered was like the careful  speech of a drunken man. A bird flew out of a bush, and I could see him  holding himself tight to keep from screaming. The best I could do was  to put a hand on his shoulder and stroke him as one strokes a  frightened horse. The sight of the price my old friend had paid didn't  put me in love with pacificism.    We talked of brother officers and South Africa, for I wanted to keep  his thoughts off the war, but he kept edging round to it.    'How long will the damned thing last?' he asked.    'O"]]]
