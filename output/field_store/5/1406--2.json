DEDICATED    TO    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  SIR WILFRID LAURIER, G. C. M. G.  PREMIER OF CANADA      PREFACE      What young man of our race would not gladly give a year of his life  to roll backward the scroll of time for five decades and live that  year in the romantic bygone-days of the Wild West; to see the great  Missouri while the Buffalo pastured on its banks, while big game  teemed in sight and the red man roamed and hunted, unchecked by  fence or hint of white man's rule; or, when that rule was represented  only by scattered trading-posts, hundreds of miles apart, and  at best the traders could exchange the news by horse or canoe and  months of lonely travel?    I for one, would have rejoiced in tenfold payment for the privilege  of this backward look in our age, and had reached the middle life  before I realised that, at a much less heavy cost, the miracle was  possible today.    For the uncivilised Indian still roams the far reaches of absolutely  unchanged, unbroken forest and prairie leagues, and has knowledge  of white men only in bartering furs at the scattered trading-posts,  where locomotive and telegraph are unknown; still the wild Buffalo  elude the hunters, fight the Wolves, wallow, wander, and breed;  and still there is hoofed game by the million to be found where the  Saxon is as seldom seen as on the Missouri in the times of Lewis  and Clarke. Only we must seek it all, not in the West, but in the  far North-west; and for \"Missouri and Mississippi\" read \"Peace and  Mackenzie Rivers,\" those noble streams that northward roll their  mile-wide turbid floods a thousand leagues to the silent Arctic  Sea.    This was the thought which spurred me to a six months' journey  by canoe. And I found what I went in search of, but found, also,  abundant and better rewards that were not in mind, even as Saul,  the son of Kish, went seeking asses and found for himself a crown  and a great kingdom.    Four years have gone by since I lived through these experiences.  Such a lapse of time may have made my news grow stale, but it has  also given the opportunity for the working up of specimens and  scientific records. The results, for the most part, will be found  in the Appendices, and three of these, as indicated--namely, the  sections on Plants, Mammals, and Birds--are the joint work of my  assistant, Mr. Edward A. Preble, and myself.    My thanks are due here to the Right Honourable Lord Strathcona, G.  C. M. G., Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, for giving me access  to the records of the Company whenever I needed them for historical  purposes; to the Honourable Frank Oliver, Minister of the Interior,  Canada, for the necessary papers and permits to facilitate scientific  collection, and also to Clarence C. Chipman, Esq., of Winnipeg,  the Hudson's Bay Company's Commissioner, for practical help in  preparing my outfit, and for letters of introduction to the many  officers of the Company, whose kind help was so often a Godsend.    ERNEST THOMPSON SETON.          CHAPTER I    DEPARTURE FOR THE NORTH        In 1907 I set out to journey by canoe down the Athabaska and adjoining  waters to the sole remaining forest wilds--the far north-west of  Canada--and the yet more desert Arctic Plains, where still, it was  said, were to be seen the Caribou in their primitive condition.    My only companion was Edward A. Preble, of Washington, D. C., a  trained naturalist,--an expert canoeist and traveller, and a man  of three seasons' experience in the Hudson's Bay Territory and the  Mackenzie Valley. While my chief object was to see the Caribou,  and prove their continued abundance, I was prepared incidentally  to gather natural-history material of all kinds, and to complete  the shore line of the ambiguous lake called \"Aylmer,\" as well as  explore its sister, the better-known Clinton-Colden.    I went for my own pleasure at my own expense, and yet I could not  persuade my Hudson's Bay Company friends that I was not sent by  some government, museum or society for some secret purpose.    On the night of May 5 we left Winnipeg, and our observations began  with the day at Brandon.    From that point westward to Regina we saw abundant evidence that  last year had been a \"rabbit year,\" that is, a year in which the  ever-fluctuating population of Northern Hares (Snowshoe-rabbits  or White-rabbits) had reached its maximum, for nine-tenths of the  bushes in sight from the train had been barked at the snow level.  But the fact that we saw not one Rabbit shows that \"the plague\" had  appeared, had run its usual drastic course, and nearly exterminated  the species in this particular region.    Early next morning at Kininvie (40 miles west of Medicine Hat,  Alberta) we saw a band of 4 Antelope south of the track; later  we saw others all along as far as Gleichen. All were south of the  track. The bands contained as follows: 4, 14, 18, 8, 12, 8, 4, 1,  4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 18, 2, 6, 34, 6, 3, 1, 10, 25, 16, 3, 7, 9 (almost  never 2, probably because this species does not pair), or 232  Antelope in 26 bands along 70 miles of track; but all were on the  south side; not one was noted on the north.    The case is simple. During the past winter, while the Antelope were  gone southward, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had fenced its  track. In spring the migrants, returning, found themselves cut off  from their summer feeding-grounds by those impassable barb-wires, and  so were gathered against the barrier. One band of 8, at a stopping  place, ran off when they saw passengers alighting, but at half a  mile they turned, and again came up against the fence, showing how  strong is the northward impulse.    Unless they learn some way of mastering the difficulty, it means  extermination for the Antelope of the north Saskatchewan.    From Calgary we went by train to Edmonton. This is the point  of leaving the railway, the beginning of hard travel, and here we  waited a few days to gather together our various shipments of food  and equipment, and to await notice that the river was open.    In the north the grand event of the year is the opening of the  rivers. The day when the ice goes out is the official first day  of spring, the beginning of the season; and is eagerly looked for,  as every day's delay means serious loss to the traders, whose men  are idle, but drawing pay as though at work.    On May 11, having learned that the Athabaska was open, we left  Edmonton in a livery rig, and drove 94 miles northward though a most  promising, half-settled country, and late the next day arrived at  Athabaska Landing, on the great east tributary of the Mackenzie,  whose waters were to bear us onward for so many weeks.    Athabaska Landing is a typical frontier town. These are hard words,  but justified. We put up at the principal hotel; the other lodgers  told me it was considered the worst hotel in the world. I thought  I knew of two worse, but next morning accepted the prevailing view.    Our canoe and provisions arrived, but the great convoy of scows  that were to take the annual supplies of trade stuff for the far  north was not ready, and we needed the help and guidance of its  men, so must needs wait for four days.    This gave us the opportunity to study the local natural history  and do a little collecting, the results of which appear later.    The great size of the timber here impressed me. I measured a typical  black poplar (P. balsamifera), 100 feet to the top, 8 feet 2 inches  in circumference, at 18 inches from the ground, and I saw many  thicker, but none taller.    At the hotel, also awaiting the scows, was a body of four  (dis-)Mounted Police, bound like ourselves for the far north. The  officer in charge turned out to be an old friend from Toronto, Major  A. M. Jarvis. I also met John Schott, the gigantic half-breed, who  went to the Barren Grounds with Caspar Whitney in 1895. He seemed  to have great respect for Whitney as a tramper, and talked much of  the trip, evidently having forgotten his own shortcomings of the  time. While I sketched his portrait, he regaled me with memories  of his early days on Red River, where he was born in 1841. 1 did  not fail to make what notes I could of those now historic times.  His accounts of the Antelope on White Horse Plain, in 1855, and  Buffalo about the site of Carberry, Manitoba, in 1852, were new  and valuable light on the ancient ranges of these passing creatures.    All travellers who had preceded me into the Barren Grounds had  relied on the abundant game, and in consequence suffered dreadful  hardships; in some cases even starved to death. I proposed to rely  on no game, but to take plenty of groceries, the best I could buy  in Winnipeg, which means the best in the world; and, as will be  seen later, the game, because I was not relying on it, walked into  camp every day.    But one canoe could not carry all these provisions, so most of it  I shipped on the Hudson's Bay Company scows, taking with us, in  the canoe, food for not more than a week, which with camp outfit  was just enough for ballast.    Of course I was in close touch with the Hudson's Bay people. Although  nominally that great trading company parted with its autocratic  power and exclusive franchise in 1870, it is still the sovereign  of the north. And here let me correct an error that is sometimes  found even in respectable print--the Company has at all times been  ready to assist scientists to the utmost of its very ample power.  Although jealous of its trading rights, every one is free to enter  the territory without taking count of the Company, but there has  not yet been a successful scientific expedition into the region  without its active co-operati"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#1)"],[1,"Lucia    by E. F. Benson          Chapter ONE      Though the sun was hot on this July morning Mrs Lucas preferred to  cover the half-mile that lay between the station and her house on her  own brisk feet, and sent on her maid and her luggage in the fly that  her husband had ordered to meet her. After those four hours in the  train a short walk would be pleasant, but, though she veiled it from  her conscious mind, another motive, sub-consciously engineered,  prompted her action. It would, of course, be universally known to all  her friends in Riseholme that she was arriving today by the 12.26, and  at that hour the village street would be sure to be full of them. They  would see the fly with luggage draw up at the door of The Hurst, and  nobody except her maid would get out.    That would be an interesting thing for them: it would cause one of  those little thrills of pleasant excitement and conjectural exercise  which supplied Riseholme with its emotional daily bread. They would all  wonder what had happened to her, whether she had been taken ill at the  very last moment before leaving town and with her well-known fortitude  and consideration for the feelings of others, had sent her maid on to  assure her husband that he need not be anxious. That would clearly be  Mrs Quantock's suggestion, for Mrs Quantock's mind, devoted as it was  now to the study of Christian Science, and the determination to deny  the existence of pain, disease and death as regards herself, was always  full of the gloomiest views as regards her friends, and on the  slightest excuse, pictured that they, poor blind things, were suffering  from false claims. Indeed, given that the fly had already arrived at  The Hurst, and that its arrival had at this moment been seen by or  reported to Daisy Quantock, the chances were vastly in favour of that  lady's having already started in to give Mrs Lucas absent treatment.  Very likely Georgie Pillson had also seen the anticlimax of the fly's  arrival, but he would hazard a much more probable though erroneous  solution of her absence. He would certainly guess that she had sent on  her maid with her luggage to the station in order to take a seat for  her, while she herself, oblivious of the passage of time, was spending  her last half hour in contemplation of the Italian masterpieces at the  National Gallery, or the Greek bronzes at the British Museum. Certainly  she would not be at the Royal Academy, for the culture of Riseholme,  led by herself, rejected as valueless all artistic efforts later than  the death of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and a great deal of what went before.  Her husband with his firm grasp of the obvious, on the other hand,  would be disappointingly capable even before her maid confirmed his  conjecture, of concluding that she had merely walked from the station.    The motive, then, that made her send her cab on, though subconsciously  generated, soon penetrated into her consciousness, and these guesses at  what other people would think when they saw it arrive without her,  sprang from the dramatic element that formed so large a part of her  mentality, and made her always take, as by right divine, the leading  part in the histrionic entertainments with which the cultured of  Riseholme beguiled or rather strenuously occupied such moments as could  be spared from their studies of art and literature, and their social  engagements. Indeed she did not usually stop at taking the leading  part, but, if possible, doubled another character with it, as well as  being stage-manager and adapter, if not designer of scenery. Whatever  she did--and really she did an incredible deal--she did it with all the  might of her dramatic perception, did it in fact with such earnestness  that she had no time to have an eye to the gallery at all, she simply  contemplated herself and her own vigorous accomplishment. When she  played the piano as she frequently did, (reserving an hour for practice  every day), she cared not in the smallest degree for what anybody who  passed down the road outside her house might be thinking of the  roulades that poured from her open window: she was simply Emmeline  Lucas, absorbed in glorious Bach or dainty Scarletti, or noble  Beethoven. The latter perhaps was her favorite composer, and many were  the evenings when with lights quenched and only the soft effulgence of  the moon pouring in through the uncurtained windows, she sat with her  profile, cameo-like (or like perhaps to the head on a postage stamp)  against the dark oak walls of her music-room, and entranced herself and  her listeners, if there were people to dinner, with the exquisite  pathos of the first movement of the Moonlight Sonata. Devotedly as she  worshipped the Master, whose picture hung above her Steinway Grand, she  could never bring herself to believe that the two succeeding movements  were on the same sublime level as the first, and besides they \"went\"  very much faster. But she had seriously thought, as she came down in  the train today and planned her fresh activities at home of trying to  master them, so that she could get through their intricacies with  tolerable accuracy. Until then, she would assuredly stop at the end of  the first movement in these moonlit seances, and say that the other two  were more like morning and afternoon. Then with a sigh she would softly  shut the piano lid, and perhaps wiping a little genuine moisture from  her eyes, would turn on the electric light and taking up a book from  the table, in which a paper-knife marked the extent of her penetration,  say:    \"Georgie, you must really promise me to read this life of Antonino  Caporelli the moment I have finished it. I never understood the rise of  the Venetian School before. As I read I can smell the salt tide  creeping up over the lagoon, and see the campanile of dear Torcello.\"    And Georgie would put down the tambour on which he was working his copy  of an Italian cope and sigh too.    \"You are too wonderful!\" he would say. \"How do you find time for  everything?\"    She rejoined with the apophthegm that made the rounds of Riseholme next  day.    \"My dear, it is just busy people that have time for everything.\"    It might be thought that even such activities as have here been  indicated would be enough to occupy anyone so busily that he would  positively not have time for more, but such was far from being the case  with Mrs Lucas. Just as the painter Rubens amused himself with being  the ambassador to the Court of St. James--a sufficient career in itself  for most busy men--so Mrs Lucas amused herself, in the intervals of her  pursuit of Art for Art's sake, with being not only an ambassador but a  monarch. Riseholme might perhaps according to the crude materialism of  maps, be included in the kingdom of Great Britain, but in a more real  and inward sense it formed a complete kingdom of its own, and its queen  was undoubtedly Mrs Lucas, who ruled it with a secure autocracy  pleasant to contemplate at a time when thrones were toppling, and  imperial crowns whirling like dead leaves down the autumn winds. The  ruler of Riseholme, happier than he of Russia, had no need to fear the  finger of Bolshevism writing on the wall, for there was not in the  whole of that vat which seethed so pleasantly with culture, one bubble  of revolutionary ferment. Here there was neither poverty nor discontent  nor muttered menace of any upheaval: Mrs Lucas, busy and serene, worked  harder than any of her subjects, and exercised an autocratic control  over a nominal democracy.    Something of the consciousness of her sovereignty was in her mind, as  she turned the last hot corner of the road and came in sight of the  village street that constituted her kingdom. Indeed it belonged to her,  as treasure trove belongs to the Crown, for it was she who had been the  first to begin the transformation of this remote Elizabethan village  into the palace of culture that was now reared on the spot where ten  years ago an agricultural population had led bovine and unilluminated  lives in their cottages of grey stone or brick and timber. Before that,  while her husband was amassing a fortune, comfortable in amount and  respectable in origin, at the Bar, she had merely held up a small dim  lamp of culture in Onslow Gardens. But both her ambition and his had  been to bask and be busy in artistic realms of their own when the  materialistic needs were provided for by sound investments, and so when  there were the requisite thousands of pounds in secure securities she  had easily persuaded him to buy three of these cottages that stood  together in a low two-storied block. Then, by judicious removal of  partition-walls, she had, with the aid of a sympathetic architect,  transmuted them into a most comfortable dwelling, subsequently building  on to them a new wing, that ran at right angles at the back, which was,  if anything, a shade more inexorably Elizabethan than the stem onto  which it was grafted, for here was situated the famous smoking-parlour,  with rushes on the floor, and a dresser ranged with pewter tankards,  and leaded lattice-windows of glass so antique that it was practically  impossible to see out of them. It had a huge open fireplace framed in  oak-beams with a seat on each side of the iron-backed hearth within the  chimney, and a genuine spit hung over the middle of the fire. Here,  though in the rest of the house she had for the sake of convenience  allowed the installation of electric light, there was no such  concession made, and sconces on the walls held dim iron lamps, so that  only those of the most acute vision were able to read. Even then  reading was difficult, for the book-stand on the table contained  nothing but a few crabbed black-letter volumes dating from not later  than the early seventeenth century, and you had to be in a frantically  Elizabethan frame of mind to be at ease there. But Mrs Lucas often  spent some of her rare"]]]
