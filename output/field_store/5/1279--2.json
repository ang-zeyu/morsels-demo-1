Phil Brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house  where he lived with his step-mother and her son, when a snow-ball, moist  and hard, struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis. The pain  was considerable, and Phil's anger rose.    He turned suddenly, his eyes flashing fiercely, intent upon discovering  who had committed this outrage, for he had no doubt that it was  intentional.    He looked in all directions, but saw no one except a mild old gentleman  in spectacles, who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way  through the obstructed street.    Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had  taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him. So he looked farther, but  his ears gave him the first clew.    He heard a chuckling laugh, which seemed to proceed from behind the  stone wall that ran along the roadside.    \"I will see who it is,\" he decided, and plunging through the snow he  surmounted the wall, in time to see a boy of about his own age running  away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow.    \"So it's you, Jonas!\" he shouted wrathfully. \"I thought it was some  sneaking fellow like you.\"    Jonas Webb, his step-brother, his freckled face showing a degree of  dismay, for he had not calculated on discovery, ran the faster, but  while fear winged his steps, anger proved the more effectual spur, and  Phil overtook him after a brief run, from the effects of which both boys  panted.    \"What made you throw that snow-ball?\" demanded Phil angrily, as he  seized Jonas by the collar and shook him.    \"You let me alone!\" said Jonas, struggling ineffectually in his grasp.    \"Answer me! What made you throw that snowball?\" demanded Phil, in a tone  that showed he did not intend to be trifled with.    \"Because I chose to,\" answered Jonas, his spite getting the better of  his prudence. \"Did it hurt you?\" he continued, his eyes gleaming with  malice.    \"I should think it might. It was about as hard as a cannon-ball,\"  returned Phil grimly. \"Is that all you've got to say about it?\"    \"I did it in fun,\" said Jonas, beginning to see that he had need to be  prudent.    \"Very well! I don't like your idea of fun. Perhaps you won't like mine,\"  said Phil, as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow, and  then kneeling by his side, rubbed his face briskly with snow.    \"What are you doin'? Goin' to murder me?\" shrieked Jonas, in anger and  dismay.    \"I am going to wash your face,\" said Phil, continuing the operation  vigorously.    \"I say, you quit that! I'll tell my mother,\" ejaculated Jonas,  struggling furiously.    \"If you do, tell her why I did it,\" said Phil.    Jonas shrieked and struggled, but in vain. Phil gave his face an  effectual scrubbing, and did not desist until he thought he had avenged  the bad treatment he had suffered.    \"There, get up!\" said he at length.    Jonas scrambled to his feet, his mean features working convulsively with  anger.    \"You'll suffer for this!\" he shouted.    \"You won't make me!\" said Phil contemptuously.    \"You're the meanest boy in the village.\"    \"I am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me.\"    \"I'll tell my mother!\"    \"Go home and tell her!\"    Jonas started for home, and Phil did not attempt to stop him.    As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward, he said to  himself:    \"I suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I can't help it. Mrs.  Brent always stands up for her precious son, who is as like her as can  be. Well, it won't make matters much worse than they have been.\"    Phil concluded not to go home at once, but to allow a little time for  the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story. So he  delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door. He  opened the door, brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom  that stood behind the door, and opening the inner door, stepped into the  kitchen.    No one was there, as Phil's first glance satisfied him, and he was  disposed to hope that Mrs. Brent--he never called her mother--was out,  but a thin, acid, measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon  satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve.    \"Philip Brent, come here!\"    Phil entered the sitting-room.    In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman, with a sharp visage,  cold eyes and firmly compressed lips, to whom no child would voluntarily  draw near.    On a sofa lay outstretched the hulking form of Jonas, with whom he had  had his little difficulty.    \"I am here, Mrs. Brent,\" said Philip manfully.    \"Philip Brent,\" said Mrs. Brent acidly, \"are you not ashamed to look me  in the face?\"    \"I don't know why I should be,\" said Philip, bracing himself up for the  attack.    \"You see on the sofa the victim of your brutality,\" continued Mrs.  Brent, pointing to the recumbent figure of her son Jonas.    Jonas, as if to emphasize these words, uttered a half groan.    Philip could not help smiling, for to him it seemed ridiculous.    \"You laugh,\" said his step-mother sharply. \"I am not surprised at it.  You delight in your brutality.\"    \"I suppose you mean that I have treated Jonas brutally.\"    \"I see you confess it.\"    \"No, Mrs. Brent, I do not confess it. The brutality you speak of was all  on the side of Jonas.\"    \"No doubt,\" retorted Mrs. Brent, with sarcasm.    \"It's the case of the wolf and the lamb over again.\"    \"I don't think Jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened,\"  said Phil. \"Did he tell you that he flung a snow-ball at my head as hard  as a lump of ice?\"    \"He said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him  like a tiger.\"    \"There's a little mistake in that,\" said Phil. \"The snow-ball was hard  enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher. I wouldn't be hit  like that again for ten dollars.\"    \"That ain't so! Don't believe him, mother!\" said Jonas from the sofa.    \"And what did you do?\" demanded Mrs. Brent with a frown.    \"I laid him down on the snow and washed his face with soft snow.\"    \"You might have given him his death of cold,\" said Mrs. Brent, with  evident hostility. \"I am not sure but the poor boy will have pneumonia  now, in consequence of your brutal treatment.\"    \"And you have nothing to say as to his attack upon me?\" said Phil  indignantly.    \"I have no doubt you have very much exaggerated it.\"    \"Yes, he has,\" chimed in Jonas from the sofa.    Phil regarded his step-brother with scorn.    \"Can't you tell the truth now and then, Jonas?\" he asked contemptuously.    \"You shall not insult my boy in my presence!\" said Mrs. Brent, with a  little spot of color mantling her high cheek-bones. \"Philip Brent, I  have too long endured your insolence. You think because I am a woman you  can be insolent with impunity, but you will find yourself mistaken. It  is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your  tone. Learn, then, that you have not a cent of your own. You are wholly  dependent upon my bounty.\"    \"What! Did my father leave you all his money?\" asked Philip.    \"He was NOT your father!\" answered Mrs. Brent coldly.        CHAPTER II.    A STRANGE REVELATION.    Philip started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from  the lips of his step-mother. It seemed to him as if the earth were  crumbling beneath his feet, for he had felt no more certain of the  existence of the universe than of his being the son of Gerald Brent.    He was not the only person amazed at this declaration. Jonas, forgetting  for the moment the part he was playing, sat bolt upright on the sofa,  with his large mouth wide open, staring by turns at Philip and his  mother.    \"Gosh!\" he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and  bewilderment.    \"Will you repeat that, Mrs. Brent?\" asked Philip, after a brief pause,  not certain that he had heard aright.    \"I spoke plain English, I believe,\" said Mrs. Brent coldly, enjoying the  effect of her communication.    \"I said that Mr. Brent, my late husband, was not your father.\"    \"I don't believe you!\" burst forth Philip impetuously.    \"You don't wish to believe me, you mean,\" answered his step-mother,  unmoved.    \"No, I don't wish to believe you,\" said the boy, looking her in the eye.    \"You are very polite to doubt a lady's word,\" said Mrs. Brent with  sarcasm.    \"In such a matter as that I believe no one's word,\" said Phil. \"I ask  for proof.\"    \"Well, I am prepared to satisfy you. Sit down and I will tell you the  story.\"    Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother  fixedly.    \"Whose son am I,\" he demanded, \"if not Mr. Brent's?\"    \"You are getting on too fast. Jonas,\" continued his mother, suddenly  turning to her hulking son, on whose not very intelligent countenance  there was an expression of greedy curiosity, \"do you understand that  what I am going to say is to be a secret, not to be spoken of to any  one?\"    \"Yes'm,\" answered Jonas readily.    \"Very well. Now to proceed. Philip, you have heard probably that when  you were very small your father--I mean Mr. Brent--lived in a small town  in Ohio, called Fultonville?\"    \"Yes, I have heard him say so.\"    \"Do you remember in what business he was then engaged?\"    \"He kept a hotel.\"    \"Yes; a small hotel, but as large as the place required. He was not  troubled by many guests. The few who stopped at his house were business  men from towns near by, or drummers from the great cities, who had  occasion to stay over a night.

ROBERTS    AUTHOR OF    \"THE GOSPEL,\" \"THE LIFE OF JOHN TAYLOR,\" \"OUTLINES OF ECCLESIASTICAL  HISTORY,\" \"SUCCESSION IN THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH,\" ETC., ETC.    * * * *    \"Some millions must be wrong, that's pretty clear. * * * * 'Tis time  that some new prophet should appear.\"    * * * *    PUBLISHED BY GEORGE Q. CANNON & SONS COMPANY, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.  1895.        PREFACE.    Three quarters of a century have passed away since Joseph Smith  first declared that he had received a revelation from God. From that  revelation and others that followed there has sprung into existence  what men call a new religion--\"Mormonism;\" and a new church, the  institution commonly known as the \"Mormon Church,\" the proper name of  which, however, is THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    Though it may seem a small matter, the reader should know that  \"Mormonism\" is not a new religion. Those who accept it do not so regard  it; it makes no such pretentions. The institution commonly called the  \"Mormon Church,\" is not a new church; it makes no such pretensions, as  will be seen by its very name--the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. This of itself discloses what \"The Mormon Church\" claims to  be--the Church of Jesus Christ; and to distinguish it from the Church  of Jesus Christ that existed in former days, the phrase \"of Latter-day  Saints\" is added. \"Mormonism,\" I repeat, is not a new religion; it is  the Old Religion, the Everlasting Gospel, restored again to the earth  through the revelations received by Joseph Smith.    At a glance the reader will observe that these claims in behalf of  \"Mormonism\" pre-suppose the destruction of the primitive Christian  Church, a complete apostasy from the Christian religion; and hence,  from the standpoint of a believer, \"Mormonism\" is the Gospel of Jesus  Christ restored; and the institution which grows out of it--the  church--is the Church of Jesus Christ re-established among men.    During the three quarters of a century that have elapsed since the  first revelation was announced by Joseph Smith, the world has been  flooded with all manner of rumors concerning the origin of \"Mormonism,\"  its doctrines, its organization, its purposes, its history. Books  enough to make a respectable library, as to size, have been written on  these subjects, but the books, in the main, are the works of avowed  enemies, or of sensational writers who chose \"Mormonism\" for a subject  because in it they supposed they had a theme that would be agreeable to  their own vicious tastes and perverted talents, and give satisfactory  returns in money for their labor. This latter class of writers have  not only written without regard to truth, but without shame. They are  ghouls who have preyed upon the misfortunes of an unpopular people  solely for the money or notoriety they could make out of the enterprise.    That I may not be thought to overstate the unreliability of anti-Mormon  literature, I make an excerpt from a book written by Mr. Phil  Robinson, called _Sinners and Saints_. [1] Mr. Robinson came to Utah  in 1882 as a special correspondent of _The New York World,_ and stayed  in Utah some five or six months, making \"Mormonism\" and the Latter-day  Saints a special study. On the untrustworthiness of the literature in  question, he says:    \"Whence have the public derived their opinions about Mormonism? From  anti-Mormons only. I have ransacked the literature of the subject,  and yet I really could not tell anyone where to go for an impartial  book about Mormonism later in date than Burton's 'City of the Saints,'  published in 1862. * * * But put Burton on one side, and I think I  can defy any one to name another book about the Mormons worthy of  honest respect. From that truly _awful_ book, 'The History of the  Saints,' published by one Bennett (even an anti-Mormon has styled him  'the greatest rascal that ever came to the West,') in 1842, down to  Stenhouse's in 1873, there is not to my knowledge a single Gentile work  before the public that is not utterly unreliable from its distortion of  facts. Yet it is from these books--for there are no others--that the  American public has acquired nearly all its ideas about the people of  Utah.\"    It may be asked why have not the Saints themselves written books  refuting the misrepresentations of their detractors, and giving correct  information about themselves and their religion. To that inquiry there  are several answers. One is that they _have_ made the attempt. Perhaps  not on a sufficiently extensive scale. They may not have appreciated  fully the importance of doing so; but chiefly the reason they have  not published more books in their own defense, and have not been more  solicitous about refuting slanders published against them, is because  of the utter impossibility of getting a hearing. The people to whom  they appealed were hopelessly prejudiced against them. Their case was  prejudged and they themselves condemned before a hearing could be had.  These were the disadvantages under which they labored; and how serious  such disadvantages are, only those know who have felt the cruel tyranny  of prejudice.    Now, however, there seems to be a change in the tide of their  affairs. Prejudice has somewhat subsided. There is in various  quarters indications of a willingness to hear what accredited  representatives of the \"Mormon\" faith may have to say in its behalf.  It is this circumstance that has induced the author to present for the  consideration of his fellow-men this work, which is written, however,  not with a view of defending the character of the Latter-day Saints,  but to set forth the message that \"Mormonism\" has to proclaim to the  world, and point out the evidences of divine inspiration in him through  whom that message was delivered.    The author has chosen for his work the title, \"A NEW WITNESS FOR GOD,\"  because that is the relation Joseph Smith, the great modern prophet,  sustains to this generation; and it is the author's purpose to prove,  first, that the world stands in need of such a witness; and, second,  that Joseph Smith is that witness.    The subject is treated under four THESES.    I.    _The world needs a New Witness for God._    II.    _The Church of Christ was destroyed; there has been an apostasy from  the Christian religion so complete and universal as to make necessary a  New Dispensation of the Gospel;_    III.    _The Scriptures declare that the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the last  days--in the hour of God's judgment--will be restored to the earth by a  re-opening of the heavens, and giving a New Dispensation thereof to the  children of men._    IV.    _Joseph Smith is the New Witness for God; a prophet divinely authorized  to preach the Gospel and re-establish the Church of Jesus Christ on  earth._    How well the writer has succeeded in sustaining these propositions, the  reader will judge for himself; he only asks that his treatment of the  subjects be considered with candor.    To guard against error or inaccuracy in doctrine the writer applied to  the First Presidency of the Church for a committee of brethren well  known for their soundness in the faith, and broad knowledge of the  doctrines of the Church, to hear read the manuscript of this book.  Whereupon Elder Franklin D. Richards, one of the Twelve Apostles of the  New Dispensation, and Church Historian; Elder George Reynolds, one of  the author's fellow-Presidents in the First Council of the Seventies;  and Elder John Jaques, Assistant Church Historian, were appointed as  such committee; and to these brethren, for their patient labor in  reading the manuscript, and for their suggestions and corrections, the  writer is under lasting obligations.
