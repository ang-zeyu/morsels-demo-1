GERARD    LATE AMBASSADOR TO THE GERMAN IMPERIAL COURT          TO MY SMALL BUT TACTFUL FAMILY OF ONE    MY WIFE        FOREWORD    I am writing what should have been the last chapter of this book  as a foreword because I want to bring home to our people the  gravity of the situation; because I want to tell them that the  military and naval power of the German Empire is unbroken; that of  the twelve million men whom the Kaiser has called to the colours  but one million, five hundred thousand have been killed, five  hundred thousand permanently disabled, not more than five hundred  thousand are prisoners of war, and about five hundred thousand  constitute the number of wounded or those on the sick list of  each day, leaving at all times about nine million effectives  under arms.    I state these figures because Americans do not grasp either the  magnitude or the importance of this war. Perhaps the statement  that over five million prisoners of war are held in the various  countries will bring home to Americans the enormous mass of men  engaged.    There have been no great losses in the German navy, and any losses  of ships have been compensated for by the building of new ones.  The nine million men, and more, for at least four hundred thousand  come of military age in Germany every year, because of their  experience in two and a half years of war are better and more  efficient soldiers than at the time when they were called to  the colours. Their officers know far more of the science of this  war and the men themselves now have the skill and bearing of  veterans.    Nor should anyone believe that Germany will break under starvation  or make peace because of revolution.    The German nation is not one which makes revolutions. There will  be scattered riots in Germany, but no simultaneous rising of the  whole people. The officers of the army are all of one class,  and of a class devoted to the ideals of autocracy. A revolution  of the army is impossible; and at home there are only the boys  and old men easily kept in subjection by the police.    There is far greater danger of the starvation of our Allies than  of the starvation of the Germans. Every available inch of ground  in Germany is cultivated, and cultivated by the aid of the old  men, the boys and the women, and the two million prisoners of  war.    The arable lands of Northern France and of Roumania are being  cultivated by the German army with an efficiency never before  known in these countries, and most of that food will be added  to the food supplies of Germany. Certainly the people suffer;  but still more certainly this war will not be ended because of  the starvation of Germany.    Although thinking Germans know that if they do not win the war  the financial day of reckoning will come, nevertheless, owing to  the clever financial handling of the country by the government  and the great banks, there is at present no financial distress in  Germany; and the knowledge that, unless indemnities are obtained  from other countries, the weight of the great war debt will fall  upon the people, perhaps makes them readier to risk all in a  final attempt to win the war and impose indemnities upon not  only the nations of Europe but also upon the United States of  America.    We are engaged in a war against the greatest military power the  world has ever seen; against a people whose country was for so  many centuries a theatre of devastating wars that fear is bred  in the very marrow of their souls, making them ready to submit  their lives and fortunes to an autocracy which for centuries has  ground their faces, but which has promised them, as a result of  the war, not only security but riches untold and the dominion of  the world; a people which, as from a high mountain, has looked  upon the cities of the world and the glories of them, and has  been promised these cities and these glories by the devils of  autocracy and of war.    We are warring against a nation whose poets and professors, whose  pedagogues and whose parsons have united in stirring its people  to a white pitch of hatred, first against Russia, then against  England and now against America.    The U-Boat peril is a very real one for England. Russia may either  break up into civil wars or become so ineffective that the millions  of German troops engaged on the Russian front may be withdrawn  and hurled against the Western lines. We stand in great peril,  and only the exercise of ruthless realism can win this war for us.  If Germany wins this war it means the triumph of the autocratic  system. It means the triumph of those who believe not only in  war as a national industry, not only in war for itself but also  in war as a high and noble occupation. Unless Germany is beaten  the whole world will be compelled to turn itself into an armed  camp, until the German autocracy either brings every nation under  its dominion or is forever wiped out as a form of government.    We are in this war because we were forced into it: because Germany  not only murdered our citizens on the high seas, but also filled  our country with spies and sought to incite our people to civil  war. We were given no opportunity to discuss or negotiate. The  forty-eight hour ultimatum given by Austria to Serbia was not,  as Bernard Shaw said, \"A decent time in which to ask a man to  pay his hotel bill.\" What of the six-hour ultimatum given to  me in Berlin on the evening of January thirty-first, 1917, when  I was notified at six that ruthless warfare would commence at  twelve? Why the German government, which up to that moment had  professed amity and a desire to stand by the _Sussex_ pledges,  knew that it took almost two days to send a cable to America! I  believe that we are not only justly in this war, but prudently  in this war. If we had stayed out and the war had been drawn  or won by Germany we should have been attacked, and that while  Europe stood grinning by: not directly at first, but through an  attack on some Central or South American State to which it would  be at least as difficult for us to send troops as for Germany.  And what if this powerful nation, vowed to war, were once firmly  established in South or Central America? What of our boasted  isolation then?    It is only because I believe that our people should be informed  that I have consented to write this book. There are too many  thinkers, writers and speakers in the United States; from now  on we need the doers, the organisers, and the realists who alone  can win this contest for us, for democracy and for permanent  peace!    Writing of events so new, I am, of course, compelled to exercise  a great discretion, to keep silent on many things of which I  would speak, to suspend many judgments and to hold for future  disclosure many things, the relation of which now would perhaps  only serve to increase bitterness or to cause internal dissension  in our own land.    The American who travels through Germany in summer time or who  spends a month having his liver tickled at Homburg or Carlsbad,  who has his digestion restored by Dr. Dapper at Kissingen or  who relearns the lost art of eating meat at Dr. Dengler's in  Baden, learns little of the real Germany and its rulers; and in  this book I tell something of the real Germany, not only that  my readers may understand the events of the last three years  but also that they may judge of what is likely to happen in our  future relations with that country.

Clemens)                               Part 1.          PREFACE    The ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are  historical, and the episodes which are used to illustrate them  are also historical.  It is not pretended that these laws and  customs existed in England in the sixth century; no, it is only  pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the English and other  civilizations of far later times, it is safe to consider that it is  no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in  practice in that day also.  One is quite justified in inferring  that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that  remote time, its place was competently filled by a worse one.    The question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right  of kings is not settled in this book.  It was found too difficult.  That the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty  character and extraordinary ability, was manifest and indisputable;  that none but the Deity could select that head unerringly, was  also manifest and indisputable; that the Deity ought to make that  selection, then, was likewise manifest and indisputable; consequently,  that He does make it, as claimed, was an unavoidable deduction.  I mean, until the author of this book encountered the Pompadour,  and Lady Castlemaine, and some other executive heads of that kind;  these were found so difficult to work into the scheme, that it  was judged better to take the other tack in this book (which  must be issued this fall), and then go into training and settle  the question in another book.  It is, of course, a thing which  ought to be settled, and I am not going to have anything particular  to do next winter anyway.    MARK TWAIN    HARTFORD, July 21, 1889            A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT          A WORD OF EXPLANATION    It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger  whom I am going to talk about.  He attracted me by three things:  his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor,  and the restfulness of his company--for he did all the talking.  We fell together, as modest people will, in the tail of the herd  that was being shown through, and he at once began to say things  which interested me.  As he talked along, softly, pleasantly,  flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world  and time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country;  and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that I seemed  to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray  antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!  Exactly as I would  speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most familiar  neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Launcelot  of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the  Table Round--and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry  and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on!  Presently  he turned to me and said, just as one might speak of the weather,  or any other common matter--    \"You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about  transposition of epochs--and bodies?\"    I said I had not heard of it.  He was so little interested--just  as when people speak of the weather--that he did not notice  whether I made him any answer or not. There was half a moment  of silence, immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the  salaried cicerone:    \"Ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur  and the Round Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor  le Desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in  the left breast; can't be accounted for; supposed to have been  done with a bullet since invention of firearms--perhaps maliciously  by Cromwell's soldiers.\"    My acquaintance smiled--not a modern smile, but one that must  have gone out of general use many, many centuries ago--and muttered  apparently to himself:    \"Wit ye well, _I saw it done_.\"  Then, after a pause, added:  \"I did it myself.\"    By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this  remark, he was gone.    All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped  in a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows,  and the wind roared about the eaves and corners.  From time to  time I dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory's enchanting book, and  fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed in  the fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again.  Midnight  being come at length, I read another tale, for a nightcap--this  which here follows, to wit:    HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS, AND MADE A CASTLE FREE       Anon withal came there upon him two great giants,     well armed, all save the heads, with two horrible     clubs in their hands.  Sir Launcelot put his shield     afore him, and put the stroke away of the one     giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder.     When his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were     wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,     and Sir Launcelot after him with all his might,     and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to     the middle.  Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall,     and there came afore him three score ladies and     damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked     God and him of their deliverance.  For, sir, said     they, the most part of us have been here this     seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all     manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all     great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time,     knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast     done the most worship that ever did knight in the     world, that will we bear record, and we all pray     you to tell us your name, that we may tell our     friends who delivered us out of prison.  Fair     damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du     Lake.  And so he departed from them and betaught     them unto God.  And then he mounted upon his     horse, and rode into many strange and wild     countries, and through many waters and valleys,     and evil was he lodged.  And at the last by     fortune him happened against a night to come to     a fair courtilage, and therein he found an old     gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will,     and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.     And when time was, his host brought him into a     fair garret over the gate to his bed. There     Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness     by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on     sleep. So, soon after there came one on     horseback, and knocked at the gate in great     haste.  And when Sir Launcelot heard this he rose     up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the     moonlight three knights come riding after that     one man, and all three lashed on him at once     with swords, and that one knight turned on them     knightly again and defended him. Truly, said     Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help,     for it were shame for me to see three knights     on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his     death.  And therewith he took his harness and     went out at a window by a sheet down to the four     knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high,     Turn you knights unto me, and leave your     fighting with that knight. And then they all     three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot,     and there began great battle, for they alight     all three, and strake many strokes at Sir     Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then     Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir     Launcelot.  Nay, sir, said he, I will none of     your help, therefore as ye will have my help     let me alone with them.  Sir Kay for the pleasure     of the knight suffered him for to do his will,     and so stood aside. And then anon within six     strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.       And then they all three cried, Sir Knight, we     yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  As     to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take     your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield     you unto Sir Kay the seneschal, on that covenant     I will save your lives and else not.  Fair knight,     said they, that were we loath to do; for as for     Sir Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome     him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto     him it were no reason.  Well, as to that, said     Sir Launcelot, advise you well, for ye may     choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be     yielden, it shall be unto Sir Kay.  Fair knight,     then they said, in saving our lives we will do     as thou commandest us.  Then shall ye, said Sir     Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming go unto the     court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield     you unto Queen Guenever, and put you all three     in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay     sent you thither to be her prisoners.  On the morn     Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay     sleeping; and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armor     and his shield and armed him, and so he went to     the stable and took his horse, and took his leave     of his host, and so he departed.  Then soon after     arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot; and     then he espied that he had his armor and his     horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will     grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on     him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I,     and that will beguile them; and because of his     armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace.     And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and     thanked his host.      As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my  stranger came in.  I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him  welcome.  I also comforted him with a hot Scotch"]]]
