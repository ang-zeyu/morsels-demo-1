Frontispiece caption= THE SCENE OF OUR HISTORY IS LAID UPON A LITTLE  PLANET, LOST IN THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE.      To JIMMIE \"What is the use of a book without pictures?\" said Alice.          FOREWORD    For Hansje and Willem:      WHEN I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of mine who gave me  my love for books and pictures promised to take me upon a memorable  expedition. I was to go with him to the top of the tower of Old Saint  Lawrence in Rotterdam.    And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that of Saint  Peter opened a mysterious door. \"Ring the bell,\" he said, \"when you come  back and want to get out,\" and with a great grinding of rusty old hinges  he separated us from the noise of the busy street and locked us into a  world of new and strange experiences.    For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon of  audible silence. When we had climbed the first flight of stairs, I added  another discovery to my limited knowledge of natural phenomena--that of  tangible darkness. A match showed us where the upward road continued.  We went to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had  lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly we had  plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with the roof of the  church, and it was used as a storeroom. Covered with many inches of  dust, there lay the abandoned symbols of a venerable faith which had  been discarded by the good people of the city many years ago. That which  had meant life and death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and  rubbish. The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images  and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the outspread  arms of a kindly saint.    The next floor showed us from where we had derived our light. Enormous  open windows with heavy iron bars made the high and barren room the  roosting place of hundreds of pigeons. The wind blew through the iron  bars and the air was filled with a weird and pleasing music. It was  the noise of the town below us, but a noise which had been purified and  cleansed by the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking  of horses' hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing sound  of the patient steam which had been set to do the work of man in  a thousand different ways--they had all been blended into a softly  rustling whisper which provided a beautiful background for the trembling  cooing of the pigeons.    Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And after the  first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel his way with a  cautious foot) there was a new and even greater wonder, the town-clock.  I saw the heart of time. I could hear the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid  seconds--one--two--three--up to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise  when all the wheels seemed to stop and another minute had been chopped  off eternity. Without pause it began again--one--two--three--until at  last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels a thunderous  voice, high above us, told the world that it was the hour of noon.    On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and their  terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made me turn stiff  with fright when I heard it in the middle of the night telling a story  of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it seemed to reflect upon those  six hundred years during which it had shared the joys and the sorrows of  the good people of Rotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue  jars in an old-fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who  twice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the country-folk  who had come to market to buy and sell and hear what the big world had  been doing. But in a corner--all alone and shunned by the others--a big  black bell, silent and stern, the bell of death.    Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and even more  dangerous than those we had climbed before, and suddenly the fresh air  of the wide heavens. We had reached the highest gallery. Above us the  sky. Below us the city--a little toy-town, where busy ants were hastily  crawling hither and thither, each one intent upon his or her particular  business, and beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the  open country.    It was my first glimpse of the big world.    Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have gone to the top  of the tower and enjoyed myself. It was hard work, but it repaid in full  the mere physical exertion of climbing a few stairs.    Besides, I knew what my reward would be. I would see the land and the  sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind friend the watchman,  who lived in a small shack, built in a sheltered corner of the gallery.  He looked after the clock and was a father to the bells, and he warned  of fires, but he enjoyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and  thought his own peaceful thoughts. He had gone to school almost fifty  years before and he had rarely read a book, but he had lived on the top  of his tower for so many years that he had absorbed the wisdom of that  wide world which surrounded him on all sides.    History he knew well, for it was a living thing with him. \"There,\" he  would say, pointing to a bend of the river, \"there, my boy, do you see  those trees? That is where the Prince of Orange cut the dikes to drown  the land and save Leyden.\" Or he would tell me the tale of the old  Meuse, until the broad river ceased to be a convenient harbour and  became a wonderful highroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp  upon that famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that the sea  might be free to all.    Then there were the little villages, clustering around the protecting  church which once, many years ago, had been the home of their Patron  Saints. In the distance we could see the leaning tower of Delft. Within  sight of its high arches, William the Silent had been murdered and there  Grotius had learned to construe his first Latin sentences. And still  further away, the long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home  of the man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of many an  emperor, the charity-boy whom the world came to know as Erasmus.    Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast,  immediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys and houses  and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways, which we called our  home. But the tower showed us the old home in a new light. The confused  commotion of the streets and the market-place, of the factories and  the workshop, became the well-ordered expression of human energy  and purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which  surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the problems of  the future when we had gone back to our daily tasks.    History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst  the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy task to reach the top  of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view. There is  no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done.    Here I give you the key that will open the door.    When you return, you too will understand the reason for my enthusiasm.    HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON.        CONTENTS         1.

Besides which, all that I could say of the Story, to any purpose, I have  endeavoured to say in it.    It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfully  the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years' imaginative task; or  how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself  into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of his brain  are going from him for ever. Yet, I have nothing else to tell; unless,  indeed, I were to confess (which might be of less moment still) that no  one can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I have  believed it in the writing.    Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward. I cannot close  this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful glance towards  the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month,  and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have  fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy.         London, October, 1850.          PREFACE TO THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION      I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book, that I did not find it  easy to get sufficiently far away from it, in the first sensations of  having finished it, to refer to it with the composure which this formal  heading would seem to require. My interest in it was so recent and  strong, and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret--pleasure  in the achievement of a long design, regret in the separation from many  companions--that I was in danger of wearying the reader with personal  confidences and private emotions.    Besides which, all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose, I  had endeavoured to say in it.    It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know how sorrowfully the  pen is laid down at the close of a two-years' imaginative task; or how  an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into  the shadowy world, when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going  from him for ever. Yet, I had nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I  were to confess (which might be of less moment still), that no one can  ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I believed it in  the writing.    So true are these avowals at the present day, that I can now only take  the reader into one confidence more. Of all my books, I like this the  best. It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child  of my fancy, and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I  love them. But, like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a  favourite child. And his name is    DAVID COPPERFIELD.         1869          THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER        CHAPTER 1. I AM BORN        Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that  station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my  life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have  been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night.  It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry,  simultaneously.    In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by  the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a  lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility  of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be  unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and  spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to  all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a  Friday night.    I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show  better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified  by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark,  that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still  a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of  having been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in  the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.    I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the  newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going  people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and  preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but  one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the  bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance  in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher  bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead  loss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the  market then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle  down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a  head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I  remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of  myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by  an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it  the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny  short--as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to  endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will  be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,  but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it  was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the  water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which  she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation  at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go  'meandering' about the world. It was in vain to represent to her  that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this  objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and  with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us  have no meandering.'    Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.    I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they say in  Scotland. I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon  the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is  something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw  me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have  of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the  churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it  lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour  was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of"]]]
