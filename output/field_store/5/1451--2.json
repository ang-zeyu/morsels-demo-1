THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS    FROM THE QUARTO OF 1604.                Enter CHORUS.         CHORUS. Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene,       Where Mars did mate[1] the Carthaginians;       Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,       In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;       Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,       Intends our Muse to vaunt[2] her[3] heavenly verse:       Only this, gentlemen,--we must perform       The form of Faustus' fortunes, good or bad:       To patient judgments we appeal our plaud,       And speak for Faustus in his infancy.       Now is he born, his parents base of stock,       In Germany, within a town call'd Rhodes:       Of riper years, to Wertenberg he went,       Whereas[4] his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.       So soon he profits in divinity,       The fruitful plot of scholarism grac'd,       That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name,       Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes       In heavenly matters of theology;       Till swoln with cunning,[5] of a self-conceit,       His waxen wings did mount above his reach,       And, melting, heavens conspir'd his overthrow;       For, falling to a devilish exercise,       And glutted now[6] with learning's golden gifts,       He surfeits upon cursed necromancy;       Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,       Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss:       And this the man that in his study sits.            [Exit.]              FAUSTUS discovered in his study.[7]         FAUSTUS. Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin       To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:       Having commenc'd, be a divine in shew,       Yet level at the end of every art,       And live and die in Aristotle's works.       Sweet Analytics, 'tis thou[8] hast ravish'd me!       Bene disserere est finis logices.       Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end?       Affords this art no greater miracle?       Then read no more; thou hast attain'd that[9] end:       A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit:       Bid Economy[10] farewell, and[11] Galen come,       Seeing, Ubi desinit philosophus, ibi incipit medicus:       Be a physician, Faustus; heap up gold,       And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure:       Summum bonum medicinae sanitas,       The end of physic is our body's health.       Why, Faustus, hast thou not attain'd that end?       Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?       Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,       Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague,       And thousand desperate maladies been eas'd?       Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.       Couldst[12] thou make men[13] to live eternally,       Or, being dead, raise them to life again,       Then this profession were to be esteem'd.       Physic, farewell!  Where is Justinian?              [Reads.]       Si una eademque res legatur[14] duobus, alter rem,       alter valorem rei, &c.         A pretty case of paltry legacies!              [Reads.]       Exhoereditare filium non potest pater, nisi, &c.[15]         Such is the subject of the institute,       And universal body of the law:[16]       This[17] study fits a mercenary drudge,       Who aims at nothing but external trash;       Too servile[18] and illiberal for me.       When all is done, divinity is best:       Jerome's Bible, Faustus; view it well.              [Reads.]       Stipendium peccati mors est.                                     Ha!                                          Stipendium, &c.         The reward of sin is death:  that's hard.              [Reads.]       Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas;         If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and       there's no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so       consequently die:       Ay, we must die an everlasting death.       What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,[19]       What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!       These metaphysics of magicians,       And necromantic books are heavenly;       Lines, circles, scenes,[20] letters, and characters;       Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.       O, what a world of profit and delight,       Of power, of honour, of omnipotence,       Is promis'd to the studious artizan!       All things that move between the quiet poles       Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings       Are but obeyed in their several provinces,       Nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds;       But his dominion that exceeds in this,       Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;       A sound magician is a mighty god:       Here, Faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.              Enter WAGNER.[22]         Wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,       The German Valdes and Cornelius;       Request them earnestly to visit me.         WAGNER. I will, sir.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. Their conference will be a greater help to me       Than all my labours, plod I ne'er so fast.              Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.         GOOD ANGEL. O, Faustus, lay that damned book aside,       And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,       And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!       Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.         EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art       Wherein all Nature's treasure[23] is contain'd:       Be thou on earth as Jove[24] is in the sky,       Lord and commander of these elements.[25]            [Exeunt Angels.]         FAUSTUS. How am I glutted with conceit of this!       Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,       Resolve[26] me of all ambiguities,       Perform what desperate enterprise I will?       I'll have them fly to India for gold,       Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,       And search all corners of the new-found world       For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;       I'll have them read me strange philosophy,       And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;       I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,       And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg;       I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,[27]       Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad;       I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,       And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,       And reign sole king of all the[28] provinces;       Yea, stranger engines for the brunt of war,       Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp's bridge,[29]       I'll make my servile spirits to invent.              Enter VALDES and CORNELIUS.         Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,       And make me blest with your sage conference.       Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,       Know that your words have won me at the last       To practice magic and concealed arts:       Yet not your words only,[30] but mine own fantasy,       That will receive no object; for my head       But ruminates on necromantic skill.       Philosophy is odious and obscure;       Both law and physic are for petty wits;       Divinity is basest of the three,       Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:[31]       'Tis magic, magic, that hath ravish'd me.       Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;       And I, that have with concise syllogisms[32]       Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,       And made the flowering pride of Wertenberg       Swarm to my problems, as the infernal spirits       On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,       Will be as cunning[33] as Agrippa[34] was,       Whose shadow[35] made all Europe honour him.         VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,       Shall make all nations to canonize us.       As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,       So shall the spirits[36] of every element       Be always serviceable to us three;       Like lions shall they guard us when we please;       Like Almain rutters[37] with their horsemen's staves,       Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;       Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,       Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows       Than have the[38] white breasts of the queen of love:       From[39] Venice shall they drag huge argosies,       And from America the golden fleece       That yearly stuffs old Philip's treasury;       If learned Faustus will be resolute.         FAUSTUS. Valdes, as resolute am I in this       As thou to live:  therefore object it not.         CORNELIUS. The miracles that magic will perform       Will make thee vow to study nothing else.       He that is grounded in astrology,       Enrich'd with tongues, well seen in[40] minerals,       Hath all the principles magic doth require:       Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd,[41]       And more frequented for this mystery       Than heretofore the Delphian oracle.

HENRY VAN DYKE, D.D.    EDITED BY LOGAN MARSHALL    Author of \"Life of Theodore Roosevelt,\" etc.    ILLUSTRATED With Numerous Authentic Photographs and Drawings        Dedication    To the 1635 souls who were lost with the ill-fated Titanic, and  especially to those heroic men, who, instead of trying to save  themselves, stood aside that women and children might have their chance;  of each of them let it be written, as it was written of a Greater  One--\"He Died that Others might Live\"      \"I stood in unimaginable trance And agony that cannot be  remembered.\"--COLERIDGE      Dr. Van Dyke's Spiritual Consolation to the Survivors of the Titanic      The Titanic, greatest of ships, has gone to her ocean grave. What has  she left behind her? Think clearly.    She has left debts. Vast sums of money have been lost. Some of them are  covered by insurance which will be paid. The rest is gone. All wealth is  insecure.    She has left lessons. The risk of running the northern course when it  is menaced by icebergs is revealed. The cruelty of sending a ship to  sea without enough life-boats and life-rafts to hold her company is  exhibited and underlined in black.    She has left sorrows. Hundreds of human hearts and homes are in mourning  for the loss of dear companions and friends. The universal sympathy  which is written in every face and heard in every voice proves that man  is more than the beasts that perish. It is an evidence of the divine in  humanity. Why should we care? There is no reason in the world, unless  there is something in us that is different from lime and carbon and  phosphorus, something that makes us mortals able to suffer together--              \"For we have all of us an human heart.\"    But there is more than this harvest of debts, and lessons, and sorrows,  in the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic. There is a great ideal.  It is clearly outlined and set before the mind and heart of the modern  world, to approve and follow, or to despise and reject.    It is, \"Women and children first!\"    Whatever happened on that dreadful April night among the arctic ice,  certainly that was the order given by the brave and steadfast captain;  certainly that was the law obeyed by the men on the doomed ship. But  why? There is no statute or enactment of any nation to enforce such an  order. There is no trace of such a rule to be found in the history of  ancient civilizations. There is no authority for it among the heathen  races to-day. On a Chinese ship, if we may believe the report of an  official representative, the rule would have been \"Men First, children  next, and women last.\"    There is certainly no argument against this barbaric rule on physical or  material grounds. On the average, a man is stronger than a woman, he is  worth more than a woman, he has a longer prospect of life than a woman.  There is no reason in all the range of physical and economic science,  no reason in all the philosophy of the Superman, why he should give his  place in the life-boat to a woman.    Where, then, does this rule which prevailed in the sinking Titanic come  from? It comes from God, through the faith of Jesus of Nazareth.    It is the ideal of self-sacrifice. It is the rule that \"the strong  ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak.\" It is the divine  revelation which is summed up in the words: \"Greater love hath no man  than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"    It needs a tragic catastrophe like the wreck of the Titanic to bring out  the absolute contradiction between this ideal and all the counsels of  materialism and selfish expediency.    I do not say that the germ of this ideal may not be found in other  religions. I do not say that they are against it. I do not ask any man  to accept my theology (which grows shorter and simpler as I grow older),  unless his heart leads him to it. But this I say: The ideal that the  strength of the strong is given them to protect and save the weak,  the ideal which animates the rule of \"Women and children first,\" is in  essential harmony with the spirit of Christ.    If what He said about our Father in Heaven is true, this ideal is  supremely reasonable. Otherwise it is hard to find arguments for it. The  tragedy of facts sets the question clearly before us. Think about it. Is  this ideal to survive and prevail in our civilization or not?    Without it, no doubt, we may have riches and power and dominion. But  what a world to live in!    Only through the belief that the strong are bound to protect and save  the weak because God wills it so, can we hope to keep self-sacrifice,  and love, and heroism, and all the things that make us glad to live and  not afraid to die.
