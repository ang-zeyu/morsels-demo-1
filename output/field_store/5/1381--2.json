No historical fact is, however, better established than  that till nearly the end of the nineteenth century it was the general  belief that the ancient industrial system, with all its shocking social  consequences, was destined to last, with possibly a little patching, to  the end of time. How strange and wellnigh incredible does it seem that  so prodigious a moral and material transformation as has taken place  since then could have been accomplished in so brief an interval! The  readiness with which men accustom themselves, as matters of course, to  improvements in their condition, which, when anticipated, seemed to  leave nothing more to be desired, could not be more strikingly  illustrated. What reflection could be better calculated to moderate the  enthusiasm of reformers who count for their reward on the lively  gratitude of future ages!    The object of this volume is to assist persons who, while desiring to  gain a more definite idea of the social contrasts between the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are daunted by the formal aspect of  the histories which treat the subject. Warned by a teacher's experience  that learning is accounted a weariness to the flesh, the author has  sought to alleviate the instructive quality of the book by casting it  in the form of a romantic narrative, which he would be glad to fancy  not wholly devoid of interest on its own account.    The reader, to whom modern social institutions and their underlying  principles are matters of course, may at times find Dr. Leete's  explanations of them rather trite--but it must be remembered that to  Dr. Leete's guest they were not matters of course, and that this book  is written for the express purpose of inducing the reader to forget for  the nonce that they are so to him. One word more. The almost universal  theme of the writers and orators who have celebrated this bimillennial  epoch has been the future rather than the past, not the advance that  has been made, but the progress that shall be made, ever onward and  upward, till the race shall achieve its ineffable destiny. This is  well, wholly well, but it seems to me that nowhere can we find more  solid ground for daring anticipations of human development during the  next one thousand years, than by \"Looking Backward\" upon the progress  of the last one hundred.    That this volume may be so fortunate as to find readers whose interest  in the subject shall incline them to overlook the deficiencies of the  treatment is the hope in which the author steps aside and leaves Mr.  Julian West to speak for himself.    JTABLE 5 28 1    Chapter 1    I first saw the light in the city of Boston in the year 1857. \"What!\"  you say, \"eighteen fifty-seven? That is an odd slip. He means nineteen  fifty-seven, of course.\" I beg pardon, but there is no mistake. It was  about four in the afternoon of December the 26th, one day after  Christmas, in the year 1857, not 1957, that I first breathed the east  wind of Boston, which, I assure the reader, was at that remote period  marked by the same penetrating quality characterizing it in the present  year of grace, 2000.    These statements seem so absurd on their face, especially when I add  that I am a young man apparently of about thirty years of age, that no  person can be blamed for refusing to read another word of what promises  to be a mere imposition upon his credulity. Nevertheless I earnestly  assure the reader that no imposition is intended, and will undertake,  if he shall follow me a few pages, to entirely convince him of this. If  I may, then, provisionally assume, with the pledge of justifying the  assumption, that I know better than the reader when I was born, I will  go on with my narrative. As every schoolboy knows, in the latter part  of the nineteenth century the civilization of to-day, or anything like  it, did not exist, although the elements which were to develop it were  already in ferment. Nothing had, however, occurred to modify the  immemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as  they may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were  far greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and  the poor, the educated and the ignorant. I myself was rich and also  educated, and possessed, therefore, all the elements of happiness  enjoyed by the most fortunate in that age. Living in luxury, and  occupied only with the pursuit of the pleasures and refinements of  life, I derived the means of my support from the labor of others,  rendering no sort of service in return. My parents and grand-parents  had lived in the same way, and I expected that my descendants, if I had  any, would enjoy a like easy existence.    But how could I live without service to the world? you ask. Why should  the world have supported in utter idleness one who was able to render  service? The answer is that my great-grandfather had accumulated a sum  of money on which his descendants had ever since lived. The sum, you  will naturally infer, must have been very large not to have been  exhausted in supporting three generations in idleness. This, however,  was not the fact. The sum had been originally by no means large. It  was, in fact, much larger now that three generations had been supported  upon it in idleness, than it was at first. This mystery of use without  consumption, of warmth without combustion, seems like magic, but was  merely an ingenious application of the art now happily lost but carried  to great perfection by your ancestors, of shifting the burden of one's  support on the shoulders of others. The man who had accomplished this,  and it was the end all sought, was said to live on the income of his  investments. To explain at this point how the ancient methods of  industry made this possible would delay us too much. I shall only stop  now to say that interest on investments was a species of tax in  perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry which a person  possessing or inheriting money was able to levy. It must not be  supposed that an arrangement which seems so unnatural and preposterous  according to modern notions was never criticized by your ancestors. It  had been the effort of lawgivers and prophets from the earliest ages to  abolish interest, or at least to limit it to the smallest possible  rate. All these efforts had, however, failed, as they necessarily must  so long as the ancient social organizations prevailed. At the time of  which I write, the latter part of the nineteenth century, governments  had generally given up trying to regulate the subject at all.    By way of attempting to give the reader some general impression of the  way people lived together in those days, and especially of the  relations of the rich and poor to one another, perhaps I cannot do  better than to compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach  which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely  along a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted  no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow. Despite the  difficulty of drawing the coach at all along so hard a road, the top  was covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest  ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up  out of the dust, their occupants could enjoy the scenery at their  leisure, or critically discuss the merits of the straining team.  Naturally such places were in great demand and the competition for them  was keen, every one seeking as the first end in life to secure a seat  on the coach for himself and to leave it to his child after him. By the  rule of the coach a man could leave his seat to whom he wished, but on  the other hand there were many accidents by which it might at any time  be wholly lost. For all that they were so easy, the seats were very  insecure, and at every sudden jolt of the coach persons were slipping  out of them and falling to the ground, where they were instantly  compelled to take hold of the rope and help to drag the coach on which  they had before ridden so pleasantly. It was naturally regarded as a  terrible misfortune to lose one's seat, and the apprehension that this  might happen to them or their friends was a constant cloud upon the  happiness of those who rode.    But did they think only of themselves? you ask. Was not their very  luxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with the lot of their  brothers and sisters in the harness, and the knowledge that their own  weight added to their toil? Had they no compassion for fellow beings  from whom fortune only distinguished them? Oh, yes; commiseration was  frequently expressed by those who rode for those who had to pull the  coach, especially when the vehicle came to a bad place in the road, as  it was constantly doing, or to a particularly steep hill. At such  times, the desperate straining of the team, their agonized leaping and  plunging under the pitiless lashing of hunger, the many who fainted at  the rope and were trampled in the mire, made a very distressing  spectacle, which often called forth highly creditable displays of  feeling on the top of the coach. At such times the passengers would  call down encouragingly to the toilers of the rope, exhorting them to  patience, and holding out hopes of possible compensation in another  world for the hardness of their lot, while others contributed to buy  salves and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#1)"],[1,"LOVE OF BOOKS    THE PHILOBIBLON OF RICHARD DE BURY      TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH    BY    E. C. THOMAS        \"TAKE THOU A BOOK INTO THINE HANDS AS SIMON THE JUST TOOK THE CHILD  JESUS INTO HIS ARMS TO CARRY HIM AND KISS HIM.  AND WHEN THOU HAST  FINISHED READING, CLOSE THE BOOK AND GIVE THANKS FOR EVERY WORD OUT OF  THE MOUTH OF GOD; BECAUSE IN THE LORD'S FIELD THOU HAST FOUND A HIDDEN  TREASURE.\"    THOMAS A KEMPIS: Doctrinale Juvenum          PREFACE    The Author of the Book.    Richard de Bury (1281-1345), so called from being born near Bury St.  Edmunds, was the son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He studied at Oxford;  and was subsequently chosen to be tutor to Prince Edward of Windsor,  afterwards Edward III.  His loyalty to the cause of Queen Isabella and  the Prince involved him in danger.  On the accession of his pupil he  was made successively Cofferer, Treasurer of the Wardrobe, Archdeacon  of Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield, Keeper of  the Privy Purse, Ambassador on two occasions to Pope John XXII, who  appointed him a chaplain of the papal chapel, Dean of Wells, and  ultimately, at the end of the year 1333, Bishop of Durham; the King and  Queen, the King of Scots, and all the magnates north of the Trent,  together with a multitude of nobles and many others, were present at  his enthronization.  It is noteworthy that during his stay at Avignon,  probably in 1330, he made the acquaintance of Petrarch, who has left us  a brief account of their intercourse.  In 1332 Richard visited  Cambridge, as one of the King's commissioners, to inquire into the  state of the King's Scholars there, and perhaps then became a member of  the Gild of St. Mary--one of the two gilds which founded Corpus Christi  College.    In 1334 he became High Chancellor of England, and Treasurer in 1336,  resigning the former office in 1335, so that he might help the King in  dealing with affairs abroad and in Scotland, and took a most  distinguished part in diplomatic negociations between England and  France.  In 1339 he was again in his bishopric.  Thereafter his name  occurs often among those appointed to treat of peace with Philip of  France, and with Bruce of Scotland.  It appears that he was not in  Parliament in 1344.  Wasted by long sickness--longa infirmitate  decoctus--on the 14th of April, 1345, Richard de Bury died at Auckland,  and was buried in Durham Cathedral.    Dominus Ricardus de Bury migravit ad Dominum.        The Bishop as Booklover.    According to the concluding note, the Philobiblon was completed on the  bishop's fifty-eighth birthday, the 24th of January, 1345, so that even  though weakened by illness, Richard must have been actively engaged in  his literary efforts to the very end of his generous and noble life.  His enthusiastic devoted biographer Chambre[1] gives a vivid account of  the bishop's bookloving propensities, supplementary to what can be  gathered from the Philobiblon itself.  Iste summe delectabatur in  multitudine librorum; he had more books, as was commonly reported, than  all the other English bishops put together.  He had a separate library  in each of his residences, and wherever he was residing, so many books  lay about his bed-chamber, that it was hardly possible to stand or move  without treading upon them.  All the time he could spare from business  was devoted either to religious offices or to his books.  Every day  while at table he would have a book read to him, unless some special  guest were present, and afterwards would engage in discussion on the  subject of the reading.  The haughty Anthony Bec delighted in the  appendages of royalty--to be addressed by nobles kneeling, and to be  waited on in his presence-chamber and at his table by Knights  bare-headed and standing; but De Bury loved to surround himself with  learned scholars.  Among these were such men as Thomas Bradwardine,  afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and author of the De Causa Dei;  Richard Fitzralph, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, and famous for his  hostility to the mendicant orders; Walter Burley, who dedicated to him  a translation of the Politics of Aristotle made at his suggestion; John  Mauduit, the astronomer; Robert Holkot, author of many books; Richard  de Kilvington; Richard Benworth, afterwards Bishop of London; and  Walter Seagrave, who became Dean of Chichester.\"[2]        [1] Cp. Surtees Society's edition of Scriptores Tres; also Wharton's  Anglia Sacra.    [2] An unsuccessful attempt has been made to transfer the authorship of  the book to Robert Holkot.  Various theories have been advanced against  Richard's claims.  It is noteworthy that his contemporary Adam Murimuth  disparages him as \"mediocriter literatus, volens tamen magnus clericus  reputari,\" but such disparagement must be taken with the utmost  caution. The really difficult fact to be accounted for is the omission  on the part of Chambre to mention the book.        The Bishop's Books.    In the Philobiblon, Richard de Bury frankly and clearly describes his  means and method of collecting books.  Anyhow his object was clearly  not selfish.  The treatise contains his rules for the library of the  new College at Oxford--Durham College (where Trinity College now  stands)--which he practically founded, though his successor, Bishop  Hatfield, carried the scheme into effect.  It is traditionally reported  that Richard's books were sent, in his lifetime or after his death, to  the house of the Durham Benedictines at Oxford, and there remained  until the dissolution of the College by Henry VIII., when they were  dispersed, some going into Duke Humphrey's (the University) library,  others to Balliol College, and the remainder passing into the hands of  Dr. George Owen, who purchased the site of the dissolved College.[3]    [3] Mr. J. W. Clark puts the matter as follows:--\"Durham College,  maintained by the Benedictines of Durham, was supplied with books from  the mother-house, lists of which have been preserved; and subsequently  a library was built there to contain the collection bequeathed in 1345  by Richard de Bury\" (The Care of Books, p.  142).  Mr. Thomas points  out that De Bury's executors sold at least some portion of his books;  and, moreover, his biographer says nothing of a library at Oxford.  Possibly the scheme was never carried out.  In the British Museum (Roy.  13 D. iv. 3) is a large folio MS. of the works of John of Salisbury,  which was one of the books bought back from the Bishop's executors.    Unfortunately, the \"special catalogue\" of his books prepared by Richard  has not come down to us; but \"from his own book and from the books  cited in the works of his friends and housemates, who may reasonably be  supposed to have drawn largely from the bishop's collection, it would  be possible to restore a hypothetical but not improbable Bibliotheca  Ricardi de Bury.  The difficulty would be with that contemporary  literature, which they would think below the dignity of quotation, but  which we know the Bishop collected.\"        Early Editions of the Philobiblon.    The book was first printed at Cologne in 1473, at Spires in 1483, and  at Paris in 1500.  The first English edition appeared in 1598-9, edited  by Thomas James, Bodley's first librarian.  Other editions appeared in  Germany in 1610, 1614, 1674 and 1703; at Paris in 1856; at Albany in  1861.  The texts were, with the exception of those issued in 1483 and  1599, based on the 1473 edition; though the French edition and  translation of 1856, prepared by M. Cocheris, claimed to be a critical  version, it left the text untouched, and merely gave the various  readings of the three Paris manuscripts at the foot of the pages; these  readings are moreover badly chosen, and the faults of the version are  further to be referred to the use of the ill-printed 1703 edition as  copy.    In 1832 there appeared an anonymous English translation, now known to  have been by J. B. Inglis; it followed the edition of 1473, with all  its errors and inaccuracies.    Mr. E. C. Thomas' Text.--The first true text of the Philobiblon, the  result of a careful examination of twenty-eight MSS., and of the  various printed editions, appeared in the year 1888:    \"The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, Treasurer and  Chancellor of Edward III, edited and translated by Ernest C.  Thomas,  Barrister-at-law, late Scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, and  Librarian of the Oxford Union.  London: Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co.\"    For fifteen years the enthusiastic editor--an ideal Bibliophile--had  toiled at his labour of love, and his work was on all sides received  with the recognition due to his monumental achievement.  To the great  loss of English learning, he did not long survive the conclusion of his  labours.  The very limited edition of the work was soon exhausted, and  it is by the most generous permission of his father, Mr. John Thomas,  of Lower Broughton, Manchester, that the translation--the only  trustworthy rendering of Richard de Bury's precious treatise--is now,  for the first time, made accessible to the larger book-loving public,  and fittingly inaugurates the present series of English classics.  The  general Editor desires to express his best thanks to Mr. John Thomas,  as also to Messrs. Kegan Paul, for their kindness in allowing him to  avail himself of the materials included in the 1888 edition of the  work.  He has attempted, in the brief Preface and Notes, to condense  Mr. Thomas' labours in such a way as would have been acceptable to the  lamented scholar, and though he has made bold to explain some few  textual difficulties, and to add some few references, he would fain  hope that these additions have been made with modest caution--with the  reverence due to the unstinted toil of a Bibliophile after Richard de  Bury's own pattern.  Yet once again Richard de Bury's Philobiblon,  edited and translated into English by E. C. Thomas, is presented to "]]]
