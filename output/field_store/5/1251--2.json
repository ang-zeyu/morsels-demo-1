These things are quite improbable, to be sure; but are they impossible?    Our big world rolls over as smoothly as it did centuries ago, without a  squeak to show it needs oiling after all these years of revolution.  But times change because men change, and because civilization, like  John Brown's soul, goes ever marching on.    The impossibilities of yesterday become the accepted facts of to-day.    Here is a fairy tale founded upon the wonders of electricity and  written for children of this generation.  Yet when my readers shall  have become men and women my story may not seem to their children like  a fairy tale at all.    Perhaps one, perhaps two--perhaps several of the Demon's devices will  be, by that time, in popular use.    Who knows?          1.  Rob's Workshop      When Rob became interested in electricity his clear-headed father  considered the boy's fancy to be instructive as well as amusing; so he  heartily encouraged his son, and Rob never lacked batteries, motors or  supplies of any sort that his experiments might require.    He fitted up the little back room in the attic as his workshop, and  from thence a net-work of wires soon ran throughout the house.  Not  only had every outside door its electric bell, but every window was  fitted with a burglar alarm; moreover no one could cross the threshold  of any interior room without registering the fact in Rob's workshop.  The gas was lighted by an electric fob; a chime, connected with an  erratic clock in the boy's room, woke the servants at all hours of the  night and caused the cook to give warning; a bell rang whenever the  postman dropped a letter into the box; there were bells, bells, bells  everywhere, ringing at the right time, the wrong time and all the time.  And there were telephones in the different rooms, too, through which  Rob could call up the different members of the family just when they  did not wish to be disturbed.    His mother and sisters soon came to vote the boy's scientific craze a  nuisance; but his father was delighted with these evidences of Rob's  skill as an electrician, and insisted that he be allowed perfect  freedom in carrying out his ideas.    \"Electricity,\" said the old gentleman, sagely, \"is destined to become  the motive power of the world.  The future advance of civilization will  be along electrical lines.  Our boy may become a great inventor and  astonish the world with his wonderful creations.\"    \"And in the meantime,\" said the mother, despairingly, \"we shall all be  electrocuted, or the house burned down by crossed wires, or we shall be  blown into eternity by an explosion of chemicals!\"    \"Nonsense!\" ejaculated the proud father.  \"Rob's storage batteries are  not powerful enough to electrocute one or set the house on fire.  Do  give the boy a chance, Belinda.\"    \"And the pranks are so humiliating,\" continued the lady.  \"When the  minister called yesterday and rang the bell a big card appeared on the  front door on which was printed the words: 'Busy; Call Again.'  Fortunately Helen saw him and let him in, but when I reproved Robert  for the act he said he was just trying the sign to see if it would  work.\"    \"Exactly!  The boy is an inventor already.  I shall have one of those  cards attached to the door of my private office at once.  I tell you,  Belinda, our son will be a great man one of these days,\" said Mr.  Joslyn, walking up and down with pompous strides and almost bursting  with the pride he took in his young hopeful.    Mrs. Joslyn sighed.  She knew remonstrance was useless so long as her  husband encouraged the boy, and that she would be wise to bear her  cross with fortitude.    Rob also knew his mother's protests would be of no avail; so he  continued to revel in electrical processes of all sorts, using the  house as an experimental station to test the powers of his productions.    It was in his own room, however,--his \"workshop\"--that he especially  delighted.  For not only was it the center of all his numerous \"lines\"  throughout the house, but he had rigged up therein a wonderful array of  devices for his own amusement.  A trolley-car moved around a circular  track and stopped regularly at all stations; an engine and train of  cars moved jerkily up and down a steep grade and through a tunnel; a  windmill was busily pumping water from the dishpan into the copper  skillet; a sawmill was in full operation and a host of mechanical  blacksmiths, scissors-grinders, carpenters, wood-choppers and millers  were connected with a motor which kept them working away at their  trades in awkward but persevering fashion.    The room was crossed and recrossed with wires.  They crept up the  walls, lined the floor, made a grille of the ceiling and would catch an  unwary visitor under the chin or above the ankle just when he least  expected it.  Yet visitors were forbidden in so crowded a room, and  even his father declined to go farther than the doorway.  As for Rob,  he thought he knew all about the wires, and what each one was for; but  they puzzled even him, at times, and he was often perplexed to know how  to utilize them all.    One day when he had locked himself in to avoid interruption while he  planned the electrical illumination of a gorgeous pasteboard palace, he  really became confused over the network of wires.  He had a  \"switchboard,\" to be sure, where he could make and break connections as  he chose; but the wires had somehow become mixed, and he could not tell  what combinations to use to throw the power on to his miniature  electric lights.    So he experimented in a rather haphazard fashion, connecting this and  that wire blindly and by guesswork, in the hope that he would strike  the right combination.  Then he thought the combination might be right  and there was a lack of power; so he added other lines of wire to his  connections, and still others, until he had employed almost every wire  in the room.    Yet it would not work; and after pausing a moment to try to think what  was wrong he went at it again, putting this and that line into  connection, adding another here and another there, until suddenly, as  he made a last change, a quick flash of light almost blinded him, and  the switch-board crackled ominously, as if struggling to carry a  powerful current.    Rob covered his face at the flash, but finding himself unhurt he took  away his hands and with blinking eyes attempted to look at a wonderful  radiance which seemed to fill the room, making it many times brighter  than the brightest day.    Although at first completely dazzled, he peered before him until he  discovered that the light was concentrated near one spot, from which  all the glorious rays seemed to scintillate.    He closed his eyes a moment to rest them; then re-opening them and  shading them somewhat with his hands, he made out the form of a curious  Being standing with majesty and composure in the center of the  magnificent radiance and looking down upon him!          2.  The Demon of Electricity      Rob was a courageous boy, but a thrill of fear passed over him in spite  of his bravest endeavor as he gazed upon the wondrous apparition that  confronted him.  For several moments he sat as if turned to stone, so  motionless was he; but his eyes were nevertheless fastened upon the  Being and devouring every detail of his appearance.    And how strange an appearance he presented!    His jacket was a wavering mass of white light, edged with braid of red  flames that shot little tongues in all directions.  The buttons blazed  in golden fire.  His trousers had a bluish, incandescent color, with  glowing stripes of crimson braid.  His vest was gorgeous with all the  colors of the rainbow blended into a flashing, resplendent mass.  In  feature he was most majestic, and his eyes held the soft but  penetrating brilliance of electric lights.    It was hard to meet the gaze of those searching eyes, but Rob did it,  and at once the splendid apparition bowed and said in a low, clear  voice:    \"I am here.\"    \"I know that,\" answered the boy, trembling, \"but WHY are you here?\"    \"Because you have touched the Master Key of Electricity, and I must  obey the laws of nature that compel me to respond to your summons.\"    \"I--I didn't know I touched the Master Key,\" faltered the boy.    \"I understand that.  You did it unconsciously.  No one in the world has  ever done it before, for Nature has hitherto kept the secret safe  locked within her bosom.\"    Rob took time to wonder at this statement.    \"Then who are you?\" he inquired, at length.    \"The Demon of Electricity,\" was the solemn answer.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Rob, \"a demon!\"    \"Certainly.  I am, in truth, the Slave of the Master Key, and am forced  to obey the commands of any one who is wise and brave enough--or, as in  your own case, fortunate and fool-hardy enough--to touch it.\"    \"I--I've never guessed there was such a thing as a Master Key, or--or a  Demon of Electricity, and--and I'm awfully sorry I--I called you up!\"  stammered the boy, abashed by the imposing appearance of his companion.

Many forces fuse in the progress of such a popular movement, and each  force has its own particular spokesman or leader. The prophet and the  soldier, the poet and the statesman, each gives his share of genius.  Those men who seemed to represent the most potent forces in this history  are included here.

Putting aside  consideration of his tragedies as literature, no student of the  eighteenth century can fail to appreciate his influence over Italian  thought. It was as though a people who had forgotten their nationality  suddenly heard anew the stories of their common folk-lore. The race of  Dante, of Petrarch, and of Tasso spoke again in the words of Alfieri.    It was high time that disunited Italy should find a poet's voice. There  was no vigor, no resolution, no originality from Turin to Naples, people  of all classes were sunk in apathy. No wonder that foreign lovers of  mediaeval Italy turned their eyes away from the seats of so much former  glory; there seemed little hope in a people given over to trivial  personal enjoyment. There was no liberty of speech or action--sentiment,  reason, passion were all measured by the grand-ducal yard-stick.    At about the middle of this artificial eighteenth century, in 1749,  Vittorio Alfieri was born at Asti, in Piedmont. His parents were of the  upper rank in the close social order of the small kingdom, his father  Antonio Alfieri, a man of independent means, who, as one biographer  has it, \"had never soiled his mind with ambition or his hands with  labor.\" His mother was the widow of the Marquis of Cacherano, and had  two daughters and a son before she married Antonio Alfieri. After the  latter's death, which occurred when Vittorio was scarcely a year old,  she married again, and it was this stepfather, the Chevalier Giacinto  Alfieri di Magliano, who stood in place of father to Vittorio and his  sister, as well as to their older half-brother and sisters. Although  these other children were near his own age the boy Vittorio seems to  have passed a lonely childhood, driven into unusual solitude by the  waywardness of his nature.    While still a child, Alfieri was sent away to the Academy of Turin, the  first of those journeys in which he was later to take such delight.  He cared little for books or study of any sort, he was over-critical,  and yet without the ambition to perfect himself. He spent his time, as  he says, in his famous memoirs, in acquiring a profound ignorance of  whatever he was meant to learn; and he left the Academy not only with  no knowledge of what were termed the humanities, but with no interest  in any language, speaking a mixed jargon of French and Piedmontese,  and reading practically nothing. Knowledge was held in small esteem by  all classes at that particular time, and the priests, who formed the  teaching class, were at small pains to spread a zeal for learning which  they did not share. Alfieri says, \"We translated the Lives of Cornelius  Nepos; but none of us, perhaps not even the masters, knew who these men  were whose lives we translated, nor where was their country, nor in what  times they lived, nor under what government, nor what any government  was!\"    In spite of the extraordinary incapacity of his teachers, Alfieri did  succeed in learning something, although he was always at great pains to  decry his early education. He learned sufficient Latin to translate the  Georgics of Virgil into his Italian dialect, and he was fond of reading  Goldoni and Metastasio. A little later he passed into a more advanced  grade, where he met many foreign youths who had been sent to Turin to  study, and where he was allowed some liberty in choosing his own course.  He found as much fault with these new conditions as with the old. \"The  reading of many French romances,\" he says, \"the constant association  with foreigners, and the want of all occasion to speak Italian, or  to hear it spoken, drove from my head that small amount of wretched  Tuscan which I had contrived to put there in those two or three years of  burlesque study of the humanities and asinine rhetoric.\" In place of it  he learned and read much French, then the language of polite society.    In such aimless desultory fashion Alfieri passed his boyhood. He hated  all restraint, and was continually getting into difficulties with the  officers of the Academy. He had more money than was good for him, and  spent it in the wildest extravagances whenever the opportunity offered.  He bade fair to become a more or less typical member of the Piedmont  nobility, perhaps a little more of a free-thinker than most, and  considerably more restive. He chafed at the lack of freedom allowed him  at the Academy, and on the marriage of his sister to the Count Giacinto  Cumiana besought her and the Count to use their influence to have his  scholar's bonds loosened. They succeeded, and Alfieri promptly took  advantage of his liberty to join in all the dissipations of the capital,  and to gratify his passion for riding. In about a year he became the  owner of a stable of eight horses. When his older friends cautioned the  boy against his extravagance he answered that he was his own master and  intended to do as he chose.    While still at the Academy the youth had sought a position in the  army, but very short service as ensign in a militia regiment proved to  him that he was as little fond of military restraint as of scholastic.  He traveled to Genoa with two boy friends and fell in love with their  sister-in-law, a vivacious brunette. He worshiped her from a distance,  becoming, as he writes in his ardent Italian, \"a victim to all the  feelings which Petrarch has so inimitably depicted ... feelings which  few can comprehend, and which fewer still ever experienced.\" On his  return from Genoa he considered himself a great traveler, and spoke as  such, only to be laughed at by the English, French, and German boys who  had been his classmates. Immediately he was seized with a passion for  travel. He was only seventeen years old, and knew that he would not be  permitted to travel alone. Fortunately an English teacher was about to  set out with two scholars on a journey through Italy, and was willing to  have Alfieri join his party. So strict was the court of that day that  the King's consent had to be obtained before the youth could leave the  country. Through his brother-in-law's influence Alfieri obtained the  royal permission to go abroad.    The travels had been looked forward to with the greatest excitement.  When they were begun Alfieri professed himself utterly bored by almost  everything he saw. As one of his biographers says, \"He was driven  from place to place by a demon of unrest, and was mainly concerned,  after reaching a city, in getting away from it as soon as he could. He  gives anecdotes enough in proof of this, and he forgets nothing that  can enhance the surprise of his future literary greatness.\" Whether  this desire to surprise his readers is really the keynote of the first  years in his memoirs or not, it would appear that the youth was about  as restless and turbulent-minded a creature as could be met with.  The further he traveled in Italy the less he liked it; he would not  speak the language or read the literature, he looked at an autograph  manuscript of Petrarch with supreme indifference, and wished to be  mistaken for a Frenchman. Yet this boy was to become, in time, the real  reviver of Italian letters.    After a fortnight in Milan the party traveled to Florence by way of  Parma, Modena, and Bologna. Neither people, buildings, views, pictures,  nor sculpture interested Vittorio; he no sooner reached a city than he  was eager to be posting on. Even Florence, later to be his home, did not  attract him; the only object he found to admire in the city was Michael  Angelo's tomb at Santa Croce. He must have been the worst traveling  companion possible; he hurried his friends from Florence to Rome, and  finding nothing there to interest him except St. Peter's, went on to  Naples. Naples was in the midst of a carnival,"]]]
