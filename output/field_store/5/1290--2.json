The Episode of the Old Bailey          I    THE EPISODE OF THE MEXICAN SEER      My name is Seymour Wilbraham Wentworth. I am brother-in-law and  secretary to Sir Charles Vandrift, the South African millionaire and  famous financier. Many years ago, when Charlie Vandrift was a small  lawyer in Cape Town, I had the (qualified) good fortune to marry his  sister. Much later, when the Vandrift estate and farm near Kimberley  developed by degrees into the Cloetedorp Golcondas, Limited, my  brother-in-law offered me the not unremunerative post of secretary;  in which capacity I have ever since been his constant and attached  companion.    He is not a man whom any common sharper can take in, is Charles  Vandrift. Middle height, square build, firm mouth, keen eyes--the  very picture of a sharp and successful business genius. I have only  known one rogue impose upon Sir Charles, and that one rogue, as the  Commissary of Police at Nice remarked, would doubtless have imposed  upon a syndicate of Vidocq, Robert Houdin, and Cagliostro.    We had run across to the Riviera for a few weeks in the season. Our  object being strictly rest and recreation from the arduous duties  of financial combination, we did not think it necessary to take our  wives out with us. Indeed, Lady Vandrift is absolutely wedded to the  joys of London, and does not appreciate the rural delights of the  Mediterranean littoral. But Sir Charles and I, though immersed in  affairs when at home, both thoroughly enjoy the complete change from  the City to the charming vegetation and pellucid air on the terrace  at Monte Carlo. We _are_ so fond of scenery. That delicious view  over the rocks of Monaco, with the Maritime Alps in the rear, and  the blue sea in front, not to mention the imposing Casino in the  foreground, appeals to me as one of the most beautiful prospects in  all Europe. Sir Charles has a sentimental attachment for the place.  He finds it restores and freshens him, after the turmoil of London,  to win a few hundreds at roulette in the course of an afternoon  among the palms and cactuses and pure breezes of Monte Carlo. The  country, say I, for a jaded intellect! However, we never on any  account actually stop in the Principality itself. Sir Charles thinks  Monte Carlo is not a sound address for a financier's letters. He  prefers a comfortable hotel on the Promenade des Anglais at Nice,  where he recovers health and renovates his nervous system by taking  daily excursions along the coast to the Casino.    This particular season we were snugly ensconced at the Hotel des  Anglais. We had capital quarters on the first floor--salon, study,  and bedrooms--and found on the spot a most agreeable cosmopolitan  society. All Nice, just then, was ringing with talk about a curious  impostor, known to his followers as the Great Mexican Seer, and  supposed to be gifted with second sight, as well as with endless  other supernatural powers. Now, it is a peculiarity of my able  brother-in-law's that, when he meets with a quack, he burns to  expose him; he is so keen a man of business himself that it gives  him, so to speak, a disinterested pleasure to unmask and detect  imposture in others. Many ladies at the hotel, some of whom had met  and conversed with the Mexican Seer, were constantly telling us  strange stories of his doings. He had disclosed to one the present  whereabouts of a runaway husband; he had pointed out to another the  numbers that would win at roulette next evening; he had shown a  third the image on a screen of the man she had for years adored  without his knowledge. Of course, Sir Charles didn't believe a word  of it; but his curiosity was roused; he wished to see and judge for  himself of the wonderful thought-reader.    \"What would be his terms, do you think, for a private seance?\" he  asked of Madame Picardet, the lady to whom the Seer had successfully  predicted the winning numbers.    \"He does not work for money,\" Madame Picardet answered, \"but for  the good of humanity. I'm sure he would gladly come and exhibit for  nothing his miraculous faculties.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Sir Charles answered. \"The man must live. I'd pay him  five guineas, though, to see him alone. What hotel is he stopping at?\"    \"The Cosmopolitan, I think,\" the lady answered. \"Oh no; I remember  now, the Westminster.\"    Sir Charles turned to me quietly. \"Look here, Seymour,\" he  whispered. \"Go round to this fellow's place immediately after  dinner, and offer him five pounds to give a private seance at once  in my rooms, without mentioning who I am to him; keep the name quite  quiet. Bring him back with you, too, and come straight upstairs  with him, so that there may be no collusion. We'll see just how much  the fellow can tell us.\"    I went as directed. I found the Seer a very remarkable and  interesting person. He stood about Sir Charles's own height, but was  slimmer and straighter, with an aquiline nose, strangely piercing  eyes, very large black pupils, and a finely-chiselled close-shaven  face, like the bust of Antinous in our hall in Mayfair. What gave him  his most characteristic touch, however, was his odd head of hair,  curly and wavy like Paderewski's, standing out in a halo round his  high white forehead and his delicate profile. I could see at a  glance why he succeeded so well in impressing women; he had the  look of a poet, a singer, a prophet.    \"I have come round,\" I said, \"to ask whether you will consent to  give a seance at once in a friend's rooms; and my principal wishes  me to add that he is prepared to pay five pounds as the price of the  entertainment.\"    Senor Antonio Herrera--that was what he called himself--bowed to  me with impressive Spanish politeness. His dusky olive cheeks were  wrinkled with a smile of gentle contempt as he answered gravely--    \"I do not sell my gifts; I bestow them freely. If your friend--your  anonymous friend--desires to behold the cosmic wonders that are  wrought through my hands, I am glad to show them to him.  Fortunately, as often happens when it is necessary to convince  and confound a sceptic (for that your friend is a sceptic I feel  instinctively), I chance to have no engagements at all this  evening.\" He ran his hand through his fine, long hair reflectively.  \"Yes, I go,\" he continued, as if addressing some unknown presence  that hovered about the ceiling; \"I go; come with me!\" Then he put on  his broad sombrero, with its crimson ribbon, wrapped a cloak round  his shoulders, lighted a cigarette, and strode forth by my side  towards the Hotel des Anglais.    He talked little by the way, and that little in curt sentences. He  seemed buried in deep thought; indeed, when we reached the door and  I turned in, he walked a step or two farther on, as if not noticing  to what place I had brought him. Then he drew himself up short, and  gazed around him for a moment. \"Ha, the Anglais,\" he said--and I may  mention in passing that his English, in spite of a slight southern  accent, was idiomatic and excellent. \"It is here, then; it is here!\"  He was addressing once more the unseen presence.    I smiled to think that these childish devices were intended to  deceive Sir Charles Vandrift. Not quite the sort of man (as the City  of London knows) to be taken in by hocus-pocus. And all this, I saw,  was the cheapest and most commonplace conjurer's patter.    We went upstairs to our rooms. Charles had gathered together a  few friends to watch the performance. The Seer entered, wrapt in  thought. He was in evening dress, but a red sash round his waist  gave a touch of picturesqueness and a dash of colour. He paused for  a moment in the middle of the salon, without letting his eyes rest  on anybody or anything. Then he walked straight up to Charles, and  held out his dark hand.    \"Good-evening,\" he said. \"You are the host. My soul's sight tells  me so.\"    \"Good shot,\" Sir Charles answered. \"These fellows have to be  quick-witted, you know, Mrs. Mackenzie, or they'd never get on  at it.\"    The Seer gazed about him, and smiled blankly at a person or two  whose faces he seemed to recognise from a previous existence. Then  Charles began to ask him a few simple questions, not about himself,  but about me, just to test him. He answered most of them with  surprising correctness. \"His name? His name begins with an S I  think:--You call him Seymour.\" He paused long between each clause, as  if the facts were revealed to him slowly. \"Seymour--Wilbraham--Earl  of Strafford. No, not Earl of Strafford! Seymour Wilbraham  Wentworth. There seems to be some connection in somebody's mind now  present between Wentworth and Strafford. I am not English. I do not  know what it means. But they are somehow the same name, Wentworth  and Strafford.\"    He gazed around, apparently for confirmation. A lady came to his  rescue.    \"Wentworth was the surname of the great Earl of Strafford,\" she  murmured gently; \"and I was wondering, as you spoke, whether  Mr. Wentworth might possibly be descended from him.\"    \"He is,\" the Seer replied instantly, with a flash of those dark  eyes. And I thought this curious; for though my father always  maintained the reality of the relationship, there was one link  wanting to complete the pedigree. He could not make sure that  the Hon. Thomas Wilbraham Wentworth was the father of Jonathan  Wentworth, the Bristol"]]]
