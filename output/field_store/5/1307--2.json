WACOUSTA;       or,    THE PROPHECY.    Volume One of Three      by    John Richardson            Preface    It is well known to every man conversant with the earlier history of  this country that, shortly subsequent to the cession of the Canadas to  England by France, Ponteac, the great head of the Indian race of that  period, had formed a federation of the various tribes, threatening  extermination to the British posts established along the Western  frontier. These were nine in number, and the following stratagem was  resorted to by the artful chief to effect their reduction. Investing  one fort with his warriors, so as to cut off all communication with the  others, and to leave no hope of succor, his practice was to offer terms  of surrender, which never were kept in the honorable spirit in which  the far more noble and generous Tecumseh always acted with his enemies,  and thus, in turn, seven of these outposts fell victims to their  confidence in his truth.    Detroit and Michilimackinac, or Mackinaw as it is now called, remained,  and all the ingenuity of the chieftain was directed to the possession  of these strongholds. The following plan, well worthy of his invention,  was at length determined upon. During a temporary truce, and while  Ponteac was holding forth proposals for an ultimate and durable peace,  a game of lacrosse was arranged by him to take place simultaneously on  the common or clearing on which rested the forts of Michilimackinac and  Detroit. The better to accomplish their object, the guns of the  warriors had been cut short and given to their women, who were  instructed to conceal them under their blankets, and during the game,  and seemingly without design, to approach the drawbridge of the fort.  This precaution taken, the players were to approach and throw over  their ball, permission to regain which they presumed would not be  denied. On approaching the drawbridge they were with fierce yells to  make a general rush, and, securing the arms concealed by the women, to  massacre the unprepared garrison.    The day was fixed; the game commenced, and was proceeded with in the  manner previously arranged. The ball was dexterously hurled into the  fort, and permission asked to recover it. It was granted. The  drawbridge was lowered, and the Indians dashed forward for the  accomplishment of their work of blood. How different the results in the  two garrisons! At Detroit, Ponteac and his warriors had scarcely  crossed the drawbridge when, to their astonishment and disappointment,  they beheld the guns of the ramparts depressed--the artillerymen with  lighted matches at their posts and covering the little garrison,  composed of a few companies of the 42nd Highlanders, who were also  under arms, and so distributed as to take the enemy most at an  advantage. Suddenly they withdrew and without other indication of their  purpose than what had been expressed in their manner, and carried off  the missing ball. Their design had been discovered and made known by  means of significant warnings to the Governor by an Indian woman who  owed a debt of gratitude to his family, and was resolved, at all  hazards, to save them.    On the same day the same artifice was resorted to at Michilimackinac,  and with the most complete success. There was no guardian angel there  to warn them of danger, and all fell beneath the rifle, the tomahawk,  the war-club, and the knife, one or two of the traders--a Mr. Henry  among the rest--alone excepted.    It was not long after this event when the head of the military  authorities in the Colony, apprised of the fate of these captured  posts, and made acquainted with the perilous condition of Fort Detroit,  which was then reduced to the last extremity, sought an officer who  would volunteer the charge of supplies from Albany to Buffalo, and  thence across the lake to Detroit, which, if possible, he was to  relieve. That volunteer was promptly found in my maternal grandfather,  Mr. Erskine, from Strabane, in the North of Ireland, then an officer in  the Commissariat Department. The difficulty of the undertaking will be  obvious to those who understand the danger attending a journey through  the Western wilderness, beset as it was by the warriors of Ponteac,  ever on the lookout to prevent succor to the garrison, and yet the duty  was successfully accomplished. He left Albany with provisions and  ammunition sufficient to fill several Schnectady boats--I think  seven--and yet conducted his charge with such prudence and foresight,  that notwithstanding the vigilance of Ponteac, he finally and after  long watching succeeded, under cover of a dark and stormy night, in  throwing into the fort the supplies of which the remnant of the  gallant \"Black Watch,\" as the 42nd was originally named, and a company  of whom, while out reconnoitering, had been massacred at a spot in the  vicinity of the town, thereafter called the Bloody Run, stood so  greatly in need. This important service rendered, Mr. Erskine, in  compliance with the instructions he had received, returned to Albany,  where he reported the success of the expedition.    The colonial authorities were not regardless of his interests. When the  Ponteac confederacy had been dissolved, and quiet and security restored  in that remote region, large tracts of land were granted to Mr.  Erskine, and other privileges accorded which eventually gave him the  command of nearly a hundred thousand dollars--enormous sum to have been  realized at that early period of the country. But it was not destined  that he should retain this. The great bulk of his capital was expended  on almost the first commercial shipping that ever skimmed the surface  of Lakes Huron and Erie. Shortly prior to the Revolution, he was  possessed of seven vessels of different tonnage, and the trade in which  he had embarked, and of which he was the head, was rapidly increasing  his already large fortune, when one of those autumnal hurricanes, which  even to this day continue to desolate the waters of the treacherous  lake last named, suddenly arose and buried beneath its engulfing waves  not less than six of these schooners laden with such riches, chiefly  furs, of the West as then were most an object of barter.    Mr. Erskine, who had married the daughter of one of the earliest  settlers from France, and of a family well known in history, a lady who  had been in Detroit during the siege of the British garrison by  Ponteac, now abandoned speculation, and contenting himself with the  remnant of his fortune, established himself near the banks of the  river, within a short distance of the Bloody Run. Here he continued  throughout the Revolution. Early, however, in the present century, he  quitted Detroit and repaired to the Canadian shore, where on a property  nearly opposite, which he obtained in exchange, and which in honor of  his native country he named Strabane--known as such to this day--he  passed the autumn of his days. The last time I beheld him was a day or  two subsequent to the affair of the Thames, when General Harrison and  Colonel Johnson were temporary inmates of his dwelling.    My father, of a younger branch of the Annandale family, the head of  which was attainted in the Scottish rebellion of 1745, was an officer  of Simcoe's well-known Rangers, in which regiment, and about the same  period, the present Lord Hardinge commenced his services in this  country. Being quartered at Fort Erie, he met and married at the house  of one of the earliest Canadian merchants a daughter of Mr. Erskine,  then on a visit to her sister, and by her had eight children, of whom I  am the oldest and only survivor. Having a few years after his marriage  been ordered to St. Joseph's, near Michilimackinac, my father thought  it expedient to leave me with Mr. Erskine at Detroit, where I received  the first rudiments of my education. But here I did not remain long,  for it was during the period of the stay of the detachment of Simcoe's  Rangers at St. Joseph that Mr. Erskine repaired with his family to the  Canadian shore, where on the more elevated and conspicuous part of his  grounds which are situated nearly opposite the foot of Hog Island, so  repeatedly alluded to in \"Wacousta,\" he had caused a flag-staff to be  erected, from which each Sabbath day proudly floated the colors under  which he had served, and which he never could bring himself to disown.    It was at Strabane that the old lady, with whom I was a great favorite,  used to enchain my young interest by detailing various facts connected  with the siege she so well remembered, and infused into me a longing to  grow up to manhood that I might write a book about it. The details of  the Ponteac plan for the capture of the two forts were what she most  enlarged upon, and although a long lapse of years of absence from the  scene, and ten thousand incidents of a higher and more immediate  importance might have been supposed to weaken the recollections of so  early a period of life, the impression has ever vividly remained. Hence  the first appearance of \"Wacousta\" in London in 1832, more than a  quarter of a century later. The story is founded solely on the artifice  of Ponteac to possess himself of those two last British forts. All else  is imaginary.    It is not a little curious that I, only a few years subsequent to the  narration by old Mrs. Erskine of the daring and cunning feats of  Ponteac, and his vain attempt to secure the fort of Detroit, should  myself have entered it in arms. But it was so. I had ever hated school  with a most bitter hatred, and I gladly availed myself of an offer from  General Brock to obtain for me a commission in the King's service.  Meanwhile I did duty as a cadet with the gallant 41st regiment, to  which the English edition of \"Wacousta\" was inscribed, and was one of  the guard of honor who took possession of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                                     _WINGS                               OVER ENGLAND_                                         BY                                ROY J.

The sky was blue as  blue. The trees cast dark shadows across the hillside. The sheep  wandered contentedly along the slope. To Cherry Ramsey, for one full  moment it seemed that nothing could possibly be wrong with the world.    Then with a sudden light spring she shot from her sunny corner to scan  the sky and to exclaim softly to the collie at her feet:    \"Flash old boy, it's an airplane. Perhaps it's a bomb-bomber.\" That last  word always choked her. How she hated those Nazi marauders! No, all was  not right with the world! Perhaps it never would be again for a long,  long time!    \"But Flash old boy,\" there was hot fire in her voice, \"we must all do  our best and trust God. That's what mother always says, and she's nearly  always right.\"    Flash, the splendid golden collie, stood up, appeared to listen, then  whined as if he had truly understood. And who will say he did not?    For one more full moment the scene remained just as it had been. In the  foreground were low hills and sheep feeding. Beyond that lay a level  field where two grown youths in their late teens bent over their task of  harvesting Brussels sprouts. Beyond all this were trees and barns--a  farm home,--Cherry's own home.    As she stood there, lips parted, ears straining in their attempt to  build up a mental picture of the rapidly approaching airplane, she saw  the two boys straighten up, then gaze skyward.    \"Ah! They hear it!\" she whispered. Then she tried with a sudden flash of  the imagination to picture the thoughts running through the minds at  that moment of those strangely different boys. The plane proved to be a  German bomber.    Then suddenly her heart stood still. The plane had come zooming out from  behind the nearby hills, and in a flash she had caught sight of the  hated cross on the right of the plane, the swastika on its tail.    At that same instant the taller of the two boys turned to his companion  to say:    \"I suppose that's what you call a bomber?\" His was the sharp, brisk  accent of a Midwest American.    \"Not precisely that,\" was the slow drawling reply of his typically  English companion. \"It's a Messerschmitt 110, I'd say. They do use them  for daylight bombing. But that plane is really a fighter. The best the  Jerries have. If our boys go after one of them when it flies over to do  a little bombing, it lays eggs and puts off at a fearful rate, or turns  in for a scrap.    \"And I say!\" his voice rose, \"There'll be a scrap! There's a Spitfire  after her. Good old Spitfire! Go after 'em, old boy! Here we are, with a  ringside seat!\" He dropped back to take his place on a bag of Brussels  sprouts. The tall, dark, curly-haired American youth stood where he was,  watching the two planes. His eyes were wide with excitement and wonder.  This was but his third day in England. Until this moment he had seen  nothing of the war. Even now, with the peace of open country all about  him, it did not seem possible that those two silver ships up there in  the sky would really fight an air duel, that men might come hurtling  down from out the sky to a terrible crushing death.    An exclamation from his companion brought him back to reality.    \"Oh! I say!\" came in sharp, rising tones. \"There's another of our  fighters! Now there'll surely be a scrap! That Messerschmitt can't  escape both of them! That,\" he said with a sudden intake of breath, \"is  one of your American fighters. It's called a Tomahawk.\"    \"Are they good?\" Dave asked, his eyes still on the sky.    \"Good!\" Brand exploded, \"Of course they're good! Air cooled engine. Do  350 per hour. And can they climb! Practically straight up! It's going to  be grand!\" he exclaimed, his eyes glued upon the spot where the three  planes were circling. \"They'll do that old Messerschmitt in before you  can say Jack Robinson.\"    \"They should. Two to one,\" Dave Barnes, the other boy spoke slowly, no  sarcasm in his voice, only cool appraisal. He was an American. This was  not his war. For him this was but a ringside seat to something rather  big.    The lips of the English boy, Brandon Ramsey, drew into a tense white  line. This _was_ his war. Perhaps he knew the men in those one-seated  fighters. He could not be sure of that, but there was an airbase for  fighters not three miles from his home. He knew nearly all the fliers.  As for the enemy plane, why was it here? To drop bombs on defenseless  villagers, or to spy out targets for some other plane that carried tons  of explosives. Who could say?    \"Two to one.\" His was not a happy laugh. \"There are three men in that  Messerschmitt. They're in an armored cabin. Our boys are right out there  in the open.\" There was a touch of anger in his voice.    \"I--I'm sorry,\" Dave murmured, brushing a hand before his eyes. \"I've  been in England for so short a time. Guess I don't see things your way  just yet.\"    \"That's all right,\" was the prompt and generous response. Brand gave  Dave's knee a slap. \"You'll pick it up fast. That is,\" he added, \"if  that Messerschmitt isn't still carrying its bombs and if he doesn't land  one of them right on us.\"    \"Why would he do that?\" The American boy's eyes opened wide.    \"Lighten his load. Besides, a bullet might strike a bomb. Then whew!  He'd fly into a thousand pieces. He--\"    The English boy stopped suddenly, for at that instant there came a  sput--sput--sput from the sky.    \"They're at it!\" Dave's voice was low and tense.    The burst of fire which was short and sharp had come from the Spitfire.    \"Short, broadside,\" Brand explained. \"You can't do much with a  broadside. Other plane's going too fast. They're out of range, just like  that. They--    \"Look!\" he exclaimed in a voice tense with emotion. \"The Tomahawk is  going after that plane from behind! He--    \"Nope.\" He let loose a low hiss of disgust.    \"He's gone into a power dive.\"    It was true. All the planes had been high, perhaps up 15,000 feet. Now  the Messerschmitt slipped into a dive that took it half the distance to  earth. The American boy was ready to dodge and run for it when just as  suddenly as it had gone into the dive the Nazi plane came out of it to  level off just above the farm home.    \"Look!\" Brand gripped his companion's arm hard. \"He's dropped a bomb!\"    Terror stricken, fascinated, white-hot with anger, the English boy  watched a silver spot against the dark blue sky go down--down--down.    And on the hillside, far above her home, tall, slender, beautiful  twenty-year old Cherry Ramsey, with the color gone from her cheeks, also  watched the terrifying missile speed from the sky.    \"Where will it strike?\" Her alert"]]]
