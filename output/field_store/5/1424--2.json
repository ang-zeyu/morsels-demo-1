A TRIP TO MANITOBA    BY    MARY FITZGIBBON.        \"Manitoba, the great province which now forms part of the Canadian  Dominion\"    The Rt. Hon. W. E. GLADSTONE, MP at West Calder.        DEDICATED TO LADY DUFFERIN.        PREFATORY NOTE.    The Canada Pacific Railway, so frequently referred to in the following  pages, is now almost an accomplished fact. It will, after traversing for  over a thousand miles the great prairies of the Swan River and  Saskatchewan territories, thread the Rocky Mountains and, running through  British Columbia to Vancouver's Island, unite the Pacific with the  Atlantic. Of the value of this line to the Dominion and the mother  country there cannot be two opinions. The system of granting plots of  land on each side of the railway to the Company, with power to re-sell or  give them to settlers, has been found most advantageous in, as it were,  feeding the line and creating populations along its route. The cars which  carry to distant markets the crops raised by the settlers, bring back to  them the necessaries of civilized life.    Readers who ask with the post-office authorities, \"Where is Manitoba?\"  [Footnote: Pages 58, 59] may be answered that Manitoba is a province in  the great north-west territory of the Canadian Dominion, lying within the  same parallels of latitude as London and Paris. It has one of the most  healthy climates in the world--the death-rate being lower than in any  other part of the globe,--and a soil of wondrous fertility, sometimes  yielding several crops in one year. Immense coal-fields exist within the  province; its mountains abound with ore; and its natural wealth is  enormous.    While the province of Manitoba formed part of the Hudson Bay Company's  territory, its resources were undeveloped. But in 1869 it was transferred  to the Dominion Government, and received a Lieutenant-Governor and the  privilege of sending representatives to the Parliament at Ottawa. Under  the new _régime_ enterprise and industry are amply encouraged.    The original population consisted chiefly of Indians and French  half-breeds; the abolition of the capitation tax on immigrants, however,  has resulted in a large immigration of Europeans, who, with health and  energy, cannot fail to prosper, especially as they are without European  facilities for squandering their money in luxury or intoxication. Of how  universally the Prohibitory Liquor Law prevails in Manitoba, and yet how  difficult it sometimes is to punish its infraction, an amusing instance  in given in Chapter XI. Mr. Alexander Rivington, in a valuable pamphlet  now out of print (\"On the Track of our Emigrants\"), says that when he  visited Canada it was rare to see such a thing as mendicity--too often  the result of intemperance; \"the very climate itself, so fresh and  life-giving, supplies the place of strong drink. Public-houses, the curse  of our own country, have no existence. Pauperism and theft are scarcely  known there--income-tax is not yet dreamt of.\" Free grants of one hundred  acres of prairie and meadow land are still being made to immigrants, and  the population is rapidly increasing.

This is No. 147_      _The Illustrations in this Book were coloured by hand by  Miss Gloria Cardew._             _TO     MY DEAR LITTLE PHIL_          Preface      From the extreme West of the Indo-European world, we go this year to  the extreme East. From the soft rain and green turf of Gaeldom, we  seek the garish sun and arid soil of the Hindoo. In the Land of Ire,  the belief in fairies, gnomes, ogres and monsters is all but dead; in  the Land of Ind it still flourishes in all the vigour of animism.    Soils and national characters differ; but fairy tales are the same in  plot and incidents, if not in treatment. The majority of the tales in  this volume have been known in the West in some form or other, and the  problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in  farthest West and East. Some--as Benfey in Germany, M. Cosquin in  France, and Mr. Clouston in England--have declared that India is the  Home of the Fairy Tale, and that all European fairy tales have been  brought from thence by Crusaders, by Mongol missionaries, by Gipsies,  by Jews, by traders, by travellers. The question is still before the  courts, and one can only deal with it as an advocate. So far as my  instructions go, I should be prepared, within certain limits, to hold  a brief for India. So far as the children of Europe have their fairy  stories in common, these--and they form more than a third of the  whole--are derived from India. In particular, the majority of the  Drolls or comic tales and jingles can be traced, without much  difficulty, back to the Indian peninsula.    Certainly there is abundant evidence of the early transmission by  literary means of a considerable number of drolls and folk-tales from  India about the time of the Crusaders. The collections known in Europe  by the titles of _The Fables of Bidpai_, _The Seven Wise Masters_,  _Gesta Romanorum_, and _Barlaam and Josaphat_, were extremely popular  during the Middle Ages, and their contents passed on the one hand into  the _Exempla_ of the monkish preachers, and on the other into the  _Novelle_ of Italy, thence, after many days, to contribute their quota  to the Elizabethan Drama. Perhaps nearly one-tenth of the main  incidents of European folk-tales can be traced to this source.    There are even indications of an earlier literary contact between  Europe and India, in the case of one branch of the folk-tale, the  Fable or Beast Droll. In a somewhat elaborate discussion[1] I have  come to the conclusion that a goodly number of the fables that pass  under the name of the Samian slave, Aesop, were derived from India,  probably from the same source whence the same tales were utilised in  the Jatakas, or Birth-stories of Buddha. These Jatakas contain a large  quantity of genuine early Indian folk-tales, and form the earliest  collection of folk-tales in the world, a sort of Indian Grimm,  collected more than two thousand years before the good German brothers  went on their quest among the folk with such delightful results. For  this reason I have included a considerable number of them in this  volume; and shall be surprised if tales that have roused the laughter  and wonder of pious Buddhists for the last two thousand years, cannot  produce the same effect on English children. The Jatakas have been  fortunate in their English translators, who render with vigour and  point; and I rejoice in being able to publish the translation of two  new Jatakas, kindly done into English for this volume by Mr. W. H. D.  Rouse, of Christ's College, Cambridge. In one of these I think I have  traced the source of the Tar Baby incident in \"Uncle Remus.\"    [Footnote 1: \"History of the Aesopic Fable,\" the introductory volume to  my edition of Caxton's _Fables of Esope_ (London, Nutt, 1889).]    Though Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are  also from another point of view the youngest. For it is only about  twenty-five years ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of  Indian folk-tales with her charming \"Old Deccan Days\" (London, John  Murray, 1868; fourth edition, 1889). Her example has been followed by  Miss Stokes, by Mrs. Steel, and Captain (now Major) Temple, by the  Pandit Natesa Sastri, by Mr. Knowles and Mr. Campbell, as well as  others who have published folk-tales in such periodicals as the  _Indian Antiquary_ and _The Orientalist_. The story-store of modern  India has been well dipped into during the last quarter of a century,  though the immense range of the country leaves room for any number of  additional workers and collections. Even so far as the materials  already collected go, a large number of the commonest incidents in  European folk-tales have been found in India. Whether brought there or  born there, we have scarcely any criterion for judging; but as some of  those still current among the folk in India can be traced back more  than a millennium, the presumption is in favour of an Indian origin.    From all these sources--from the Jatakas, from the Bidpai, and from  the more recent collections--I have selected those stories which throw  most light on the origin of Fable and Folk-tales, and at the same time  are most likely to attract English children. I have not, however,  included too many stories of the Grimm types, lest I should repeat  the contents of the two preceding volumes of this series. This has to  some degree weakened the case for India as represented by this book.  The need of catering for the young ones has restricted my selection  from the well-named \"Ocean of the Streams of Story,\" _Katha-Sarit  Sagara_ of Somadeva. The stories existing in Pali and Sanskrit I have  taken from translations, mostly from the German of Benfey or the  vigorous English of Professor Rhys-Davids, whom I have to thank for  permission to use his versions of the Jatakas.    I have been enabled to make this book a representative collection of  the Fairy Tales of Ind by the kindness of the original collectors or  their publishers. I have especially to thank Miss Frere, who kindly  made an exception in my favour, and granted me the use of that fine  story, \"Punchkin,\" and that quaint myth, \"How Sun, Moon, and Wind went  out to Dinner.\" Miss Stokes has been equally gracious in granting me  the use of characteristic specimens from her \"Indian Fairy Tales.\" To  Major Temple I owe the advantage of selecting from his admirable  _Wideawake Stories_, and Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. have allowed  me to use Mr. Knowles' \"Folk-tales of Kashmir,\" in their Oriental  Library; and Messrs. W. H. Allen have been equally obliging with  regard to Mrs. Kingscote's \"Tales of the Sun.\" Mr. M. L. Dames has  enabled me add to the published story-store of India by granting me  the use of one from his inedited collection of Baluchi folk-tales.    I have again to congratulate myself on the co-operation of my friend  Mr. J. D. Batten in giving beautiful or amusing form to the creations  of the folk fancy of the Hindoos. It is no slight thing to embody, as  he has done, the glamour and the humour both of the Celt and of the  Hindoo. It is only a further proof that Fairy Tales are something more  than Celtic or Hindoo. They are human.    JOSEPH JACOBS.
