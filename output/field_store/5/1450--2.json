WITH AN  ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE  DURING THE PREVIOUS AND INTERVENING PERIODS.    BY    A. KIPPIS, D.D., F.R.S., & S.A.          TO THE KING.      SIR,    I esteem myself highly honoured in being permitted to dedicate and  present my Narrative of the Life and Actions of Captain James Cook to  your Majesty. It was owing to your Majesty's royal patronage and  bounty, that this illustrious navigator was enabled to execute those  vast undertakings, and to make those extraordinary discoveries, which  have contributed so much to the reputation of the British empire, and  have reflected such peculiar glory on your Majesty's reign. Without  your Majesty's munificence and encouragement, the world would have  remained destitute of that immense light which has been thrown on  geography, navigation, and the most important sciences. To your  Majesty, therefore, a work like the present is with particular  propriety addressed.    It is impossible, on this occasion, to avoid extending my thoughts to  the other noble instances in which your Majesty's liberal protection  of science and literature has been displayed. Your Majesty began your  reign in a career so glorious to princes: and wonderful has been the  increase of knowledge and taste in this country. The improvements in  philosophical science, and particularly in astronomy; the exertions of  experimental and chemical inquiry, the advancement of natural history,  the progress and perfection of the polite arts, and the valuable  compositions that have been produced in every department of learning,  have corresponded with your Majesty's gracious wishes and  encouragement, and have rendered the name of Britain famous in every  quarter of the globe. If there be any persons who, in these respects,  would depreciate the present times, in comparison with those which  have preceded them, it may safely be asserted, that such persons have  not duly attended to the history of literature. The course of my  studies has enabled me to speak with some confidence on the subject;  and to say, that your majesty's reign is eminently distinguished by  one of the greatest glories that can belong to a monarch.    Knowledge and virtue constitute the chief happiness of a nation: and  it is devoutly to be wished that the virtue of this country were equal  to its knowledge. If it be not so, this does not arise from the want  of an illustrious example in the person of your Majesty, and that of  your royal Consort. The pattern which is set by the King and Queen of  Great Britain, of those qualities which are the truest ornaments and  felicities of life, affords a strong incitement to the imitation of  the same excellencies; and cannot fail of contributing to the more  extensive prevalence of that moral conduct on which the welfare of  society so greatly depends.    That your Majesty may possess every felicity in your royal Person and  Family, and enjoy a long and prosperous reign, over an enlightened, a  free, and a happy people, is the sincere and ardent prayer of,    SIR,  Your Majesty's most faithful,  and most obedient,  subject and servant,    ANDREW KIPPIS.  London, _June_ 31, 1788.          PREFACE.      Although I have often appeared before the public as a writer, I never  did it with so much diffidence and anxiety as on the present occasion.  This arises from the peculiar nature of the work in which I have now  engaged. A Narrative of the Life and Actions of Captain Cook must  principally consist of the voyages and discoveries he made, and the  difficulties and dangers to which he was exposed. The private  incidents concerning him, though collected with the utmost diligence,  can never compare, either in number or importance, with his public  transactions. His public transactions are the things that mark the  man, that display his mind and his character; and, therefore they are  the grand objects to which the attention of his biographer must be  directed. However, the right conduct of this business is a point of no  small difficulty and embarrassment. The question will frequently  arise, How far the detail should be extended? There is a danger, on  the one hand, of being carried to an undue length, and of enlarging,  more than is needful, on facts which may be thought already  sufficiently known; and, on the other hand, of giving such a jejune  account, and such a slight enumeration of important events, as shall  disappoint the wishes and expectations of the reader. Of the two  extremes, the last seems to be that which should most be avoided; for,  unless what Captain Cook performed, and what he encountered, be  related somewhat at large, his Life and Actions would be imperfectly  represented to the world. The proper medium appears to be, to bring  forward the things in which he was personally concerned, and to pass  slightly over other matters. Even here it is scarcely possible, nor  would it be desirable, to avoid the introduction of some of the most  striking circumstances which relate to the new countries and  inhabitants that were visited by our great navigator, since these  constitute a part of the knowledge and benefit derived from his  undertakings. Whether I have been so happy as to preserve the due  medium, I presume not to determine. I have been anxious to do it,  without always being able fully to satisfy my own mind that I have  succeeded; on which account I shall not be surprised if different  opinions should be formed on the subject. In that case, all that I can  offer in my own defence will be, that I have acted to the best of my  judgment. At any rate I flatter myself with the hope of having  presented to the public a work not wholly uninteresting or  unentertaining. Those who are best acquainted with Captain Cook's  expeditions, may be pleased with reviewing them in a more compendious  form, and with having his actions placed in a closer point of view, in  consequence of their being divested of the minute nautical, and other  details, which were essentially necessary in the voyages at large. As  to those persons, if there be any, who have hitherto obtained but an  imperfect knowledge of what was done and discovered by this  illustrious man, they will not be offended with the length of the  following narrative.    In various respects, new information will be found in the present  performance; and other things, which were less perfectly known before,  are set in a clearer and fuller light. This, I trust, will appear in  the first, third, fifth, and seventh chapters. It may be observed,  likewise, that the fresh matter now communicated is of the most  authentic kind, and derived from the most respectable sources. My  obligations of this nature are, indeed, very great, and call for my  warmest gratitude. The dates and facts relative to Captain Cook's  different promotions are taken from the books of the Admiralty, by the  directions of the noble lord who is at the head of that Board, and the  favour of Mr. Stephens. I embrace with pleasure this opportunity of  mentioning, that, in the course of my life, I have experienced, in  several instances, Lord Howe's condescending and favourable attention.  To Mr. Stephens I am indebted for other communications besides those  which concern the times of Captain Cook's preferments, and for his  general readiness in forwarding the design of the present work. The  Earl of Sandwich, the great patron of our navigator, and the principal  mover in his mighty undertakings, has honoured me with some important  information concerning him, especially with regard to the  circumstances which preceded his last voyage. To Sir Hugh Palliser's  zeal for the memory of his friend I stand particularly obliged. From a  large communication, with which he was so good as to favour me, I have  derived very material intelligence, as will appear in the course of  the narrative, and especially in the first chapter. In the same  chapter are some facts which I received from Admiral Graves, through  the hands of the Rev. Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Carlisle (whose  admirable Introduction to the Voyage to the Pacific Ocean must be of  the most essential service to every writer of the Life of Captain  Cook). The Captain's amiable and worthy Widow, who is held in just  esteem by all his friends, has given me an account of several domestic  circumstances. I should be deficient in gratitude, were I here to omit  the name of Mr. Samwell: for though what is inserted from him in this  work has already been laid before the public, it should be remembered,  that through the interposition of our common friend, the Rev. Mr.  Gregory, it was originally written for my use, and freely consigned to  my disposal; and that it was at my particular instance and request  that it was separately printed. My obligations to other gentlemen will  be mentioned in their proper places.    But my acknowledgments are, above all, due to Sir Joseph Banks,  President of the Royal Society, for the interest he has taken in the  present publication. It was in consequence of his advice, that it was  given to the world in the form which it now bears; and his assistance  has been invariable through every part of the undertaking. To him the  inspection of the whole has been submitted and to him it is owing,  that the work is, in many respects, far more complete than it would  otherwise have been. The exertions of zeal and friendship, I have been  so happy as to experience from him in writing the account of Captain  Cook, have corresponded with that ardour which Sir Joseph Banks is  always ready to display in promoting whatever he judges to be  subservient to the cause of science and literature.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:    The Esperanto alphabet contains 28 characters. These are the  characters of English, but with \"q\", \"w\", \"x\", and \"y\" removed, and  six diacritical letters added. The diacritical letters are \"c\",  \"g\", \"h\", \"j\" and \"s\" with circumflexes (or \"hats\", as Esperantists  fondly call them), and \"u\" with a breve. Zamenhof himself suggested  that where the diacritical letters caused difficulty, one could  instead use \"ch\", \"gh\", \"hh\", \"jh\", \"sh\" and \"u\". A plain ASCII  file is one such place; there are no ASCII codes for Esperanto's  special letters.    However, there are two problems with Zamenhof's \"h-method\". There  is no difference between \"u\" and \"u\" with a breve, and there is no  way to determine (without prior knowledge of the word(s) involved,  and sometimes a bit of context) whether an \"h\" following one of  those other five letters is really the second half of a diacritical  pair, or just an \"h\" that happened to find itself next to one of  them. Consequently other, unambiguous, methods have been used over  the years. One is the \"x-method\", which uses the digraphs \"cx\",  \"gx\", \"hx\", \"jx\", \"sx\" and \"ux\" to represent the special letters.  There is no ambiguity because the letter \"x\" is not an Esperanto  letter, and each diacritical letter has a unique transliteration.  This is the method used in this Project Gutenberg e-text.

ZAMENHOF                                 THE AUTHOR OF                                 ESPERANTO                         *       *       *       *       *                                      PREFACE.    This volume has been prepared to meet a twofold need. An adequate  presentation of the International Language has become an imperative  necessity. Such presentation, including full and accurate grammatical  explanations, suitably graded reading lessons, and similarly graded  material for translation from English, has not heretofore been  accessible within the compass of a single volume, or in fact within the  compass of any two or three volumes.    The combination of grammar and reader here offered is therefore  unique. It is to furnish not merely an introduction to Esperanto, or  a superficial acquaintance with it, but a genuine understanding of  the language and mastery of its use without recourse to additional  textbooks, readers, etc. In other words, this one volume affords  as complete a knowledge of Esperanto as several years' study of a  grammar and various readers will accomplish for any national language.  Inflection, word-formation and syntax are presented clearly and  concisely, yet with a degree of completeness and in a systematic order  that constitute a new feature. Other points worthy of note are the  following:    The reasons for syntactical usages are given, instead of mere statements  that such usages exist. For example, clauses of purpose and of result  are really explained, instead of being dismissed with the unsatisfactory  remark that \"the imperative follows 'por ke,'\" or the \"use of 'tiel ...  ke' and 'tia ... ke' must be distinguished from that of 'tiel ... kiel'  and 'tia ... kia,'\" etc., with but little intimation of when and why  \"por ke\", \"tiel ... ke\" and \"tia ... ke\" are likely to occur.    Affixes are not mentioned until some familiarity with the general  character of the language is assured, as well as the possession of  a fair vocabulary. They are introduced gradually, with adequate  explanation and illustration. Of importance in connection with  word-formation is an element distinctly new--the explanation and  classification of compound words. Such words, like affixes, are  withheld until the use of simple words is familiar.    Another new feature is the gradual introduction of correlative words in  their logical order, and in their proper grammatical categories, before  they are called \"correlatives,\" or tabulated. The tabulation finally  presented is a real classification, with regard to the meaning and  grammatical character of the words, not merely an arbitrary alphabetical  arrangement. The use of primary adverbs precedes the explanation of  adverb derivation; prepositions, especially \"de\", \"da\", \"je\", etc.,  receive careful attention, also the verb system, and the differentiation  of words whose English equivalents are ambiguous.    A general characteristic of obvious advantage is that almost without  exception new forms and constructions are illustrated by means of  words or roots already familiar. Likewise, the new words or roots of  each lesson recur at least once in the next lesson, and usually in  some lesson thereafter as well. Each reading exercise gives not only a  thorough application of the grammatical principles of the lesson, but a  review of those in the preceding lesson, and no use is made of words or  constructions not yet explained. The comparative ease of the language,  and the lack of necessity for reciting paradigms, permit the reading  exercises to be long enough for the student to feel that he has really  mastered something. These exercises are further unique, in that each  after the fifth is a coherent narrative, and nearly every one is a story  of genuine interest in itself. These stories, if bound separately, would  alone constitute a reader equivalent to those used in first and second  year work in national languages. (For list of titles, see Table of  Contents.)    The second element of the twofold need which this volume meets is the  necessity for a presentation of Esperanto, not as a thing apart, but  in that form which will make it most serviceable as an introduction to  national tongues. A stepping-stone to both ancient and modern languages,  Esperanto may render invaluable aid, and pave the way for surmounting  the many difficulties confronting both student and teacher. Through  Esperanto, the labor in the acquirement of these languages may be  reduced in the same proportion in which the pleasure and thoroughness  of such acquirement are increased. For this reason, the grammatical  constructions of Esperanto are here explained as consistently as  possible in accordance with the usage of national languages, especially  those in the school curriculum, and precise names are assigned to them.  Such matters as \"contrary to fact conditions\", \"indirect quotations\",  \"clauses of purpose\" and \"of result\", \"accusatives of time\" and  \"measure\", \"expressions of separation\", \"reference\", etc., thus  become familiar to the student, long before he meets them in the more  difficult garb of a national tongue, whose exceptions seem to outnumber  its rules, and whose idioms prove more puzzling than its exceptions,  unless approached by the smooth and gradual ascent of the International  Language, Esperanto.
