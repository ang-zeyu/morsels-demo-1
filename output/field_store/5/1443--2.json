Consider the case of Henry  Pifield Rice, detective.    I must explain Henry early, to avoid disappointment. If I simply said  he was a detective, and let it go at that, I should be obtaining the  reader's interest under false pretences. He was really only a sort of  detective, a species of sleuth. At Stafford's International  Investigation Bureau, in the Strand, where he was employed, they did  not require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police. He had  never measured a footprint in his life, and what he did not know about  bloodstains would have filled a library. The sort of job they gave  Henry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain, and note what time  someone inside left it. In short, it is not 'Pifield Rice,  Investigator. No. 1.--The Adventure of the Maharajah's Ruby' that I  submit to your notice, but the unsensational doings of a quite  commonplace young man, variously known to his comrades at the Bureau as  'Fathead', 'That blighter what's-his-name', and 'Here, you!'    Henry lived in a boarding-house in Guildford Street. One day a new girl  came to the boarding-house, and sat next to Henry at meals. Her name  was Alice Weston. She was small and quiet, and rather pretty. They got  on splendidly. Their conversation, at first confined to the weather and  the moving-pictures, rapidly became more intimate. Henry was surprised  to find that she was on the stage, in the chorus. Previous chorus-girls  at the boarding-house had been of a more pronounced type--good girls,  but noisy, and apt to wear beauty-spots. Alice Weston was different.    'I'm rehearsing at present,' she said. 'I'm going out on tour next  month in \"The Girl From Brighton\". What do you do, Mr Rice?'    Henry paused for a moment before replying. He knew how sensational he  was going to be.    'I'm a detective.'    Usually, when he told girls his profession, squeaks of amazed  admiration greeted him. Now he was chagrined to perceive in the brown  eyes that met his distinct disapproval.    'What's the matter?' he said, a little anxiously, for even at this  early stage in their acquaintance he was conscious of a strong desire  to win her approval. 'Don't you like detectives?'    'I don't know. Somehow I shouldn't have thought you were one.'    This restored Henry's equanimity somewhat. Naturally a detective does  not want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right  at the start.    'I think--you won't be offended?'    'Go on.'    'I've always looked on it as rather a _sneaky_ job.'    'Sneaky!' moaned Henry.    'Well, creeping about, spying on people.'    Henry was appalled. She had defined his own trade to a nicety. There  might be detectives whose work was above this reproach, but he was a  confirmed creeper, and he knew it. It wasn't his fault. The boss told  him to creep, and he crept. If he declined to creep, he would be sacked  _instanter_. It was hard, and yet he felt the sting of her words,  and in his bosom the first seeds of dissatisfaction with his occupation  took root.    You might have thought that this frankness on the girl's part would  have kept Henry from falling in love with her. Certainly the dignified  thing would have been to change his seat at table, and take his meals  next to someone who appreciated the romance of detective work a little  more. But no, he remained where he was, and presently Cupid, who never  shoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boarding-house hash,  sniped him where he sat.    He proposed to Alice Weston. She refused him.    'It's not because I'm not fond of you. I think you're the nicest man I  ever met.' A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled Henry to win  this place in her affections. He had worked patiently and well before  actually putting his fortune to the test. 'I'd marry you tomorrow if  things were different. But I'm on the stage, and I mean to stick there.  Most of the girls want to get off it, but not me. And one thing I'll  never do is marry someone who isn't in the profession. My sister  Genevieve did, and look what happened to her. She married a commercial  traveller, and take it from me he travelled. She never saw him for more  than five minutes in the year, except when he was selling gent's  hosiery in the same town where she was doing her refined speciality,  and then he'd just wave his hand and whiz by, and start travelling  again. My husband has got to be close by, where I can see him. I'm  sorry, Henry, but I know I'm right.'    It seemed final, but Henry did not wholly despair. He was a resolute  young man. You have to be to wait outside restaurants in the rain for  any length of time.    He had an inspiration. He sought out a dramatic agent.    'I want to go on the stage, in musical comedy.'    'Let's see you dance.'    'I can't dance.'    'Sing,' said the agent. 'Stop singing,' added the agent, hastily.    'You go away and have a nice cup of hot tea,' said the agent,  soothingly, 'and you'll be as right as anything in the morning.'    Henry went away.    A few days later, at the Bureau, his fellow-detective Simmonds hailed  him.    'Here, you! The boss wants you. Buck up!'    Mr Stafford was talking into the telephone. He replaced the receiver as  Henry entered.    'Oh, Rice, here's a woman wants her husband shadowed while he's on the  road. He's an actor. I'm sending you. Go to this address, and get  photographs and all particulars. You'll have to catch the eleven  o'clock train on Friday.'    'Yes, sir.'    'He's in \"The Girl From Brighton\" company. They open at Bristol.'    It sometimes seemed to Henry as if Fate did it on purpose. If the  commission had had to do with any other company, it would have been  well enough, for, professionally speaking, it was the most important  with which he had ever been entrusted. If he had never met Alice  Weston, and heard her views upon detective work, he would have been  pleased and flattered. Things being as they were, it was Henry's  considered opinion that Fate had slipped one over on him.    In the first place, what torture to be always near her, unable to  reveal himself; to watch her while she disported herself in the company  of other men. He would be disguised, and she would not recognize him;  but he would recognize her, and his sufferings would be dreadful.    In the second place, to have to do his creeping about and spying  practically in her presence--    Still, business was business.    At five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station, a  false beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye.  If you had asked him he would have said that he was a Scotch business  man. As a matter of fact, he looked far more like a motor-car coming  through a haystack.    The platform was crowded. Friends of the company had come to see the  company off. Henry looked on discreetly from behind a stout porter,  whose bulk formed a capital screen. In spite of himself, he was  impressed. The stage at close quarters always thrilled him. He  recognized celebrities. The fat man in the brown suit was Walter  Jelliffe, the comedian and star of the company. He stared keenly at him  through the spectacles. Others of the famous were scattered about. He  saw Alice. She was talking to a man with a face like a hatchet, and  smiling, too, as if she enjoyed it. Behind the matted foliage which he  had inflicted on his face, Henry's teeth came together with a snap.    In the weeks that followed, as he dogged 'The Girl From Brighton'  company from town to town, it would be difficult to say whether Henry  was happy or unhappy. On the one hand, to realize that Alice was so  near and yet so inaccessible was a constant source of misery; yet, on  the other, he could not but admit that he was having the very dickens  of a time, loafing round the country like this.    He was made for this sort of life, he considered. Fate had placed him  in a London office, but what he really enjoyed was this unfettered  travel. Some gipsy strain in him rendered even the obvious discomforts  of theatrical touring agreeable. He liked catching trains; he liked  invading strange hotels; above all, he revelled in the artistic  pleasure of watching unsuspecting fellow-men as if they were so many  ants.    That was really the best part of the whole thing. It was all very well  for Alice to talk about creeping and spying, but, if you considered it  without bias, there was nothing degrading about it at all. It was an  art. It took brains and a genius for disguise to make a man a  successful creeper and spyer. You couldn't simply say to yourself, 'I  will creep.' If you attempted to do it in your own person, you would be  detected instantly. You had to be an adept at masking your personality.  You had to be one man at Bristol and another quite different man at  Hull--especially if, like Henry, you were of a gregarious disposition,  and liked the society of actors.    The stage had always fascinated Henry. To meet even minor members of  the profession off the boards gave him a thrill. There was a resting  juvenile, of fit-up calibre, at his boarding-house who could always get  a shilling out of him simply by talking about how he had jumped in and  saved the show at the hamlets which he had visited in the course of his  wanderings. And on this 'Girl From Brighton' tour he was in constant  touch with men who really amounted to something. Walter Jelliffe had  been a celebrity when Henry was going to school; and Sidney Crane, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477"],[0,"The Book of Wonder (#1)"],[1,"BOOK OF WONDER    BY  LORD DUNSANY        CONTENTS      Preface    The Bride of the Man-Horse    Distressing Tale of Thangobrind The Jeweller    The House of the Sphinx    Probable Adventure of the Three Literary Men    The Injudicious Prayers of Pombo the Idolater    The Loot of Bombasharna    Miss Cubbidge and the Dragon Of Romance    The Quest of the Queen's Tears    The Hoard of the Gibbelins    How Nuth Would Have Practised His Art Upon the Gnoles    How One Came, As Was Foretold, to the City Of Never    The Coronation of Mr. Thomas Shap    Chu-Bu and Sheemish    The Wonderful Window    Epilogue        PREFACE      Come with me, ladies and gentlemen who are in any wise weary of  London: come with me: and those that tire at all of the world we know:  for we have new worlds here.        THE BRIDE OF THE MAN-HORSE      In the morning of his two hundred and fiftieth year Shepperalk the  centaur went to the golden coffer, wherein the treasure of the  centaurs was, and taking from it the hoarded amulet that his father,  Jyshak, in the years of his prime, had hammered from mountain gold and  set with opals bartered from the gnomes, he put it upon his wrist, and  said no word, but walked from his mother's cavern. And he took with  him too that clarion of the centaurs, that famous silver horn, that in  its time had summoned to surrender seventeen cities of Man, and for  twenty years had brayed at star-girt walls in the Siege of  Tholdenblarna, the citadel of the gods, what time the centaurs waged  their fabulous war and were not broken by any force of arms, but  retreated slowly in a cloud of dust before the final miracle of the  gods that They brought in Their desperate need from Their ultimate  armoury. He took it and strode away, and his mother only sighed and  let him go.    She knew that today he would not drink at the stream coming down from  the terraces of Varpa Niger, the inner land of the mountains, that  today he would not wonder awhile at the sunset and afterwards trot  back to the cavern again to sleep on rushes pulled by rivers that know  not Man. She knew that it was with him as it had been of old with his  father, and with Goom the father of Jyshak, and long ago with the  gods. Therefore she only sighed and let him go.    But he, coming out from the cavern that was his home, went for the  first time over the little stream, and going round the corner of the  crags saw glittering beneath him the mundane plain. And the wind of  the autumn that was gilding the world, rushing up the slopes of the  mountain, beat cold on his naked flanks. He raised his head and  snorted.    \"I am a man-horse now!\" he shouted aloud; and leaping from crag to  crag he galloped by valley and chasm, by torrent-bed and scar of  avalanche, until he came to the wandering leagues of the plain, and  left behind him for ever the Athraminaurian mountains.    His goal was Zretazoola, the city of Sombelene. What legend of  Sombelene's inhuman beauty or of the wonder of her mystery had ever  floated over the mundane plain to the fabulous cradle of the centaurs'  race, the Athraminaurian mountains, I do not know. Yet in the blood of  man there is a tide, an old sea-current rather, that is somehow akin  to the twilight, which brings him rumours of beauty from however far  away, as driftwood is found at sea from islands not yet discovered:  and this spring-tide of current that visits the blood of man comes from  the fabulous quarter of his lineage, from the legendary, the old; it  takes him out to the woodlands, out to the hills; he listens to  ancient song. So it may be that Shepperalk's fabulous blood stirred in  those lonely mountains away at the edge of the world to rumours that  only the airy twilight knew and only confided secretly to the bat, for  Shepperalk was more legendary even than man. Certain it was that he  headed from the first for the city of Zretazoola, where Sombelene in her  temple dwelt; though all the mundane plain, its rivers and mountains,  lay between Shepperalk's home and the city he sought.    When first the feet of the centaur touched the grass of that soft  alluvial earth he blew for joy upon the silver horn, he pranced and  caracoled, he gambolled over the leagues; pace came to him like a  maiden with a lamp, a new and beautiful wonder; the wind laughed as it  passed him. He put his head down low to the scent of the flowers, he  lifted it up to be nearer the unseen stars, he revelled through  kingdoms, took rivers in his stride; how shall I tell you, ye that  dwell in cities, how shall I tell you what he felt as he galloped? He  felt for strength like the towers of Bel-Narana; for lightness like  those gossamer palaces that the fairy-spider builds 'twixt heaven and  sea along the coasts of Zith; for swiftness like some bird racing up  from the morning to sing in some city's spires before daylight comes.  He was the sworn companion of the wind. For joy he was as a song; the  lightnings of his legendary sires, the earlier gods, began to mix with  his blood; his hooves thundered. He came to the cities of men, and all  men trembled, for they remembered the ancient mythical wars, and now  they dreaded new battles and feared for the race of man. Not by Clio  are these wars recorded; history does not know them, but what of that?  Not all of us have sat at historians' feet, but all have learned fable  and myth at their mothers' knees. And there were none that did not  fear strange wars when they saw Shepperalk swerve and leap along the  public ways. So he passed from city to city.    By night he lay down unpanting in the reeds of some marsh or a forest;  before dawn he rose triumphant, and hugely drank of some river in the  dark, and splashing out of it would trot to some high place to find  the sunrise, and to send echoing eastwards the exultant greetings of  his jubilant horn. And lo! the sunrise coming up from the echoes, and  the plains new-lit by the day, and the leagues spinning by like water  flung from a top, and that gay companion, the loudly laughing wind,  and men and the fears of men and their little cities; and, after that,  great rivers and waste spaces and huge new hills, and then new lands  beyond them, and more cities of men, and always the old companion, the  glorious wind. Kingdom by kingdom slipt by, and still his breath was  even. \"It is a golden thing to gallop on good turf in one's youth,\"  said the young man-horse, the centaur. \"Ha, ha,\" said the wind of the  hills, and the winds of the plain answered.    Bells pealed in frantic towers, wise men consulted parchments,  astrologers sought of the portent from the stars, the aged made subtle  prophecies. \"Is he not swift?\" said the young. \"How glad he is,\" said  children.    Night after night brought him sleep, and day after day lit his gallop,  till he came to the lands of the Athalonian men who live by the edges  of the mundane plain, and from them he came to the lands of legend  again such as those in which he was cradled on the other side of the  world, and which fringe the marge of the world and mix with the  twilight. And there a mighty thought came into his untired heart, for  he knew that he neared Zretazoola now, the city of Sombelene.    It was late in the day when he neared it, and clouds coloured with  evening rolled low on the plain before him; he galloped on into their  golden mist, and when it hid from his eyes the sight of things, the  dreams in his heart awoke and romantically he pondered all those  rumours that used to come to him from Sombelene, because of the  fellowship of fabulous things. She dwelt (said evening secretly to the  bat) in a little temple by a lone lakeshore. A grove of cypresses  screened her from the city, from Zretazoola of the climbing ways. And  opposite her temple stood her tomb, her sad lake-sepulchre with open  door, lest her amazing beauty and the centuries of her youth should  ever give rise to the heresy among men that lovely Sombelene was  immortal: for only her beauty and her lineage were divine.    Her father had been half centaur and half god; her mother was the  child of a desert lion and that sphinx that watches the pyramids;--she  was more mystical than Woman.    Her beauty was as a dream, was as a song; the one dream of a lifetime  dreamed on enchanted dews, the one song sung to some city by a  deathless bird blown far from his native coasts by storm in Paradise.  Dawn after dawn on mountains of romance or twilight after twilight  could never equal her beauty; all the glow-worms had not the secret  among them nor all the stars of night; poets had never sung it nor  evening guessed its meaning; the morning envied it, it was hidden from  lovers.    She was unwed, unwooed.    The lions came not to woo her because they feared her strength, and  the gods dared not love her because they knew she must die.    This was what evening had whispered to the bat, this was the dream in  the heart of Shepperalk as he cantered blind through the mist. And  suddenly there at his hooves in the dark of the plain appeared the  cleft in the legendary lands, and Zretazoola sheltering in the cleft,  and sunning herself in the evening.    Swiftly and craftily he bounded down by the upper end of the cleft,  and entering Zretazoola by the outer gate which looks out sheer on the  stars, he galloped suddenly down the narrow streets. Many that rushed  out on to balconies as he went clattering by, many that put their  heads from glittering windows, are told of in olden song. Shepperalk  did not tarry to give greetings or to answer challenges from martial  towers, he was down through the earthward gateway like the thunderbolt  of his sires, and, like Leviathan who has leapt at an eagle, he surged  into the water between temple and tomb.    He galloped with half-shut eyes up the temple-steps, and, only seeing  dimly through his lashes, seized Sombelene by the hair, undazzled as  yet by her beauty, and so haled her away;"]]]
