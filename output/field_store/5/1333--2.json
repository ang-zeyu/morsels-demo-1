Published with the consent and by courtesy of the National American  Society,    David I. Nelke, President.    FOREWORD.    The following debate on the \"Origin of the Book of Mormon,\" came about  in the following manner: The writer saw in the _Salt Lake Tribune_ two  numbers of Mr. Schroeder's article and observing the general trend  of the argument felt that a prompt reply should appear in the same  publication, that it might be read by the same people who would read  Mr. Schroeder's article. A letter was accordingly addressed to the  _Tribune,_ to ascertain if that paper would publish a reply to Mr.  Schroeder. The Editor answered that the _Tribune_ was reproducing the  article from the _American Historical Magazine,_ published in New York,  and that perhaps its publishers would be pleased to receive a reply to  Mr. Schroeder. If the publishers of the _Historical Magazine_ accepted  such an article, the _Tribune_ would then be willing to reproduce it,  if the _Deseret News,_ the Mormon Church organ, would agree to publish  Mr. Schroeder's article.    This suggested a too complicated arrangement to suit the writer, hence  he dropped the matter with the _Tribune,_ and took it up with the  publishers of the _American Historical Magazine,_ who gave place to his  answer to Mr. Schroeder in current numbers of that publication, 1908-9.  And the writer has heard nothing from the _Tribune_ or Mr. Schroeder  since.    At the conclusion of the article on the \"Origin of the Book of Mormon,\"  the _Historical Magazine Company,_ Mr. David I. Nelke, President,  announced their willingness to publish in _Americana,_--which in the  meantime had succeeded the _American Historical Magazine_ a detailed  history of the \"Mormon Church,\" if the writer would prepare it.    The History has been running in _Americana_ now for more than two and  a half years, and will continue until the History of the Church is  completed up to date.        *    *    *    *    *    *    And now a word as to the origin of the Book of Mormon before presenting  the discussion. It will be an advantage to the reader if he has before  him Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon. For our  present purpose the account the Prophet gives in his statement to Mr.  John Wentworth, of Chicago, of the origin of the Book of Mormon is,  on account of its brevity and comprehensiveness, most suitable. After  detailing the events of his first vision, received in the Spring of  1820, and the intervening three years, the Prophet comes to the Book of  Mormon part of his narrative:        THE APPEARING OF MORONI.        \"On the evening of the 21st of September, A. D. 1823, while I was      praying unto God and endeavoring to exercise faith in the precious      promises of scripture, on a sudden a light like that of day, only      of a far purer and more glorious appearance and brightness, burst      into the room,--indeed the first sight was as though the house was      filled with consuming fire; the appearance producing a shock that      affected the whole body; in a moment a personage stood before me      surrounded with a glory yet greater than that with which I was      already surrounded. This messenger proclaimed himself to be an      angel of God, sent to bring the joyful tidings that the covenant      which God made with ancient Israel was at hand to be fulfilled;      that the preparatory work for the second coming of the Messiah was      speedily to commence; that the time was at hand for the gospel in      all its fulness to be preached in power unto all nations, that a      people might be prepared for the Millennial reign. I was informed      that I was chosen to be an instrument in the hands of God to bring      about some of His purposes in this glorious dispensation.        THE BOOK OF MORMON.        \"I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of this      country and shown who they were, and whence they came; a brief      sketch of their origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments;      of their righteousness and iniquity, and the blessings of God      being finally withdrawn "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#1)"],[1,"OF ART    STORIES OF THE ITALIAN PAINTERS      BY AMY STEEDMAN    AUTHOR OF 'IN GOD'S GARDEN'        TO FRANCESCA        ABOUT THIS BOOK    What would we do without our picture-books, I wonder? Before we knew  how to read, before even we could speak, we had learned to love them.  We shouted with pleasure when we turned the pages and saw the spotted  cow standing in the daisy-sprinkled meadow, the foolish-looking old  sheep with her gambolling lambs, the wise dog with his friendly eyes.  They were all real friends to us.    Then a little later on, when we began to ask for stories about the  pictures, how we loved them more and more. There was the little girl in  the red cloak talking to the great grey wolf with the wicked eyes; the  cottage with the bright pink roses climbing round the lattice-window,  out of which jumped a little maid with golden hair, followed by the  great big bear, the middle-sized bear, and the tiny bear. Truly those  stories were a great joy to us, but we would never have loved them  quite so much if we had not known their pictured faces as well.    Do you ever wonder how all these pictures came to be made? They had a  beginning, just as everything else had, but the beginning goes so far  back that we can scarcely trace it.    Children have not always had picture-books to look at. In the long-ago  days such things were not known. Thousands of years ago, far away in  Assyria, the Assyrian people learned to make pictures and to carve them  out in stone. In Egypt, too, the Egyptians traced pictures upon the  walls of their temples and upon the painted mummy-cases of the dead.  Then the Greeks made still more beautiful statues and pictures in  marble, and called them gods and goddesses, for all this was at a time  when the true God was forgotten.    Afterwards, when Christ had come and the people had learned that the  pictured gods were not real, they began to think it wicked to make  beautiful pictures or carve marble statues. The few pictures that were  made were stiff and ugly, the figures were not like real men and women,  the animals and trees were very strange-looking things. And instead of  making the sky blue as it really was, they made it a chequered pattern  of gold. After a time it seemed as if the art of making pictures was  going to die out altogether.    Then came the time which is called 'The Renaissance,' a word which  means being born again, or a new awakening, when men began to draw real  pictures of real things and fill the world with images of beauty.    Now it is the stories of the men of that time, who put new life into  Art, that I am going to tell you--men who learned, step by step, to  paint the most beautiful pictures that the world possesses.    In telling these stories I have been helped by an old book called The  Lives of the Painters, by Giorgio Vasari, who was himself a painter. He  took great delight in gathering together all the stories about these  artists and writing them down with loving care, so that he shows us  real living men, and not merely great names by which the famous  pictures are known.    It did not make much difference to us when we were little children  whether our pictures were good or bad, as long as the colours were  bright and we knew what they meant. But as we grow older and wiser our  eyes grow wiser too, and we learn to know what is good and what is  poor. Only, just as our tongues must be trained to speak, our hands to  work, and our ears to love good music, so our eyes must be taught to  see what is beautiful, or we may perhaps pass it carelessly by, and  lose a great joy which might be ours.    So now if you learn something about these great artists and their  wonderful pictures, it will help your eyes to grow wise. And some day  should you visit sunny Italy, where these men lived and worked, you  will feel that they are quite old friends. Their pictures will not only  be a delight to your eyes, but will teach your heart something deeper  and more wonderful than any words can explain.

GIOTTO    It was more than six hundred years ago that a little peasant baby was  born in the small village of Vespignano, not far from the beautiful  city of Florence, in Italy. The baby's father, an honest, hard-working  countryman, was called Bondone, and the name he gave to his little son  was Giotto.    Life was rough and hard in that country home, but the peasant baby grew  into a strong, hardy boy, learning early what cold and hunger meant.  The hills which surrounded the village were grey and bare, save where  the silver of the olive-trees shone in the sunlight, or the tender  green of the shooting corn made the valley beautiful in early spring.  In summer there was little shade from the blazing sun as it rode high  in the blue sky, and the grass which grew among the grey rocks was  often burnt and brown. But, nevertheless, it was here that the sheep of  the village would be turned out to find what food they could, tended  and watched by one of the village boys.    So it happened that when Giotto was ten years old his father sent him  to take care of the sheep upon the hillside. Country boys had then no  schools to go to or lessons to learn, and Giotto spent long happy days,  in sunshine and rain, as he"]]]
