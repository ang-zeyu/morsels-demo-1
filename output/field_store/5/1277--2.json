The city of Maecenas, and of a whole crowd of famous men of later times,  shows no outward signs of being much frequented by travellers. There  is some difficulty there in getting so much as an Italian newspaper,  and, though excellent photographs have been taken of some of the chief  buildings, they must be sought for at Florence; they are not to be  bought at Arezzo. Yet the old Etruscan city has many attractions, among  them surely the singular cleanness of its streets, and, above all, that  clear and pure air which is thought to have had something to do with  nourishing the genius of so many of its citizens in so many different  ways. Perhaps, on the whole, Arezzo does not suffer from not having  yet put on the cosmopolitan character of some of its neighbours. And if  the city does not, either as Arretium or as Arezzo, stand forth in the  first rank of Italian cities, still it has a long history under both  forms of its name. If, again, its buildings do not rank with those of  Pisa or Lucca, still there is quite enough both in the general aspect  of the city, and in some particular objects within its walls, to claim  a day or two's sojourn from any one who is not eager to rush from  Florence to Rome as fast as the so-called express train can carry him.    Arezzo, as to its physical site, holds a middle position between cities  which sit perched on a high hill-top like Fiesole, and cities which,  like Florence, lie flat or nearly so on the banks of a great river.  It has its river, if we may give that name to the mere brook which  presently loses itself in the Chiana, as the Chiana soon loses itself  in the Arno. The river too has a bridge, but both river and bridge have  to be sought for; they form no important points in the general aspect  of the city. The bridge at Arezzo is not one of those to which we  instinctively go the first thing to take a general view of the city as  a whole. The hill is a more real thing, as any one will say who climbs  some of its steeper streets. Still it is one of those hills which seem  to borrow height and steepness from the fact of being built upon. If it  were covered with green grass, it would simply pass as one of several  small hills which break the flat of the rich plain, girded in on all  sides by higher mountains, which rise, in February at least, into vast  snowy heights in the further distance. Still Arezzo has distinctly the  character of a hill city, not of a river city; the hill counts for a  good deal, while the river counts for nothing. The best points for a  general view from below will be found on the town wall, a little way to  the left of the railway station; while to look down on Arezzo we must  climb to the castle in the eastern corner of the city, whose Medicean  fortifications look strong enough without, but which, within, has  gardens and fig trees level with the walls, and rabbits running about  at large among them. The castle therefore forms no special object in  the general view; it simply passes as a more marked part of the line  of the city walls. These last remain in their whole circuit, except  where they have been broken down to make the approach to the railway;  surely a new gate would have been a better way of compassing this  object. A town wall standing free, as those of Arezzo stand in nearly  their whole range, is always a striking object, and one whose circuit  it is pleasant and instructive to make. And it has a special interest  in some cities, of which Arezzo is one, which have, so to speak, a show  side. One side lies open to the world; the ancient roads, the modern  railway, approach it; the city dies away into the country by gradually  descending suburbs. On the other side, the wall suddenly parts the  inhabited town, sometimes from actual desolation, at all events from  open fields; the hill rises sheer above whatever lies beyond it. So it  is with the north-eastern side of Arezzo, if we go behind the cathedral  and the castle; we have not fully taken in the lie of the city without  taking this walk to its rear. Still we must not look to the walls of  Arezzo for the special interest of some other walls. They will not give  us either Roman or Etruscan blocks, nor yet the picturesque outline of  mediaeval towers and gateways. The walls put on their present aspect  in Medicean times, and over one of the gates we see an inscription  which illustrates one stage of a tyrant's progress. The first avowed  sovereign Cosmo appears as \"Duke of Florence and Siena.\" He had  inherited one enslaved commonwealth; he had himself enslaved another;  meanwhile he was waiting for the fitting reward of such exploits in the  higher rank and more sounding title of a Grand Duke of Tuscany.    In the general view of Arezzo there can be hardly said to be any one  dominant object. If the castle made any show, it and the cathedral  church, standing nearly on the same level on the highest ground in the  town, would stand well side by side. As it is, the body of the _duomo_  is the prominent feature in the view. But it is hardly a dominant  feature. It is the only building whose body shows itself, but it rises  among a crowd of towers, ecclesiastical and municipal, and one of  them, the great campanile of St. Mary _della Pieve_, though the body  of its church does not show itself far below, is a distinct rival to  the cathedral, and utterly dwarfs its small and modern, though not  ungraceful, octagon tower. These two churches form the two greatest  architectural objects in Arezzo. The municipal element does not show  itself so largely as might be looked for. The town-house is there, and  the town-tower, and that hard by the _duomo_; but they do not hold,  even comparatively, anything like the same position as their fellows  in the great Florentine piazza. Perhaps this is not wonderful in a  city which was so largely Ghibelin, and whose most noted historical  character was a fighting bishop. Guy Tarlati, bishop and lord of  Arezzo, keeps--though not on its old site--his splendid tomb in the  _duomo_, on which are graven the names and likenesses of the castles  which he won, and how King Lewis of Bavaria took the Lombard crown  at his hands. But Arezzo has little or nothing to show in the way of  houses or palaces or of street arcades. Its most striking building  besides the churches is the front of that called the _Fraternita dei  Laici_, in the open sloping space which seems to mark the forum of  Arretium. This is a work in the mixed style of the fourteenth century,  but so rich and graceful in its detail as to disarm criticism. Within,  it contains the public library and museum. This last has much to show  in many ways; most striking of all, because thoroughly local, are  the huge tusks and other remains of the fossil elephants and other  vast beasts of bygone days. The valley of the Chiana is full of them.  Naturally enough, in the early days of science, when elephants' bones  were no longer thought to be those of giants, they were set down as  relics of the Gaetulian beasts of Hannibal.    Something may be picked up here and there in the other churches of  Arezzo; but it is _Santa Maria della Pieve_ which is the real object  of study. The _duomo_ is absolutely without outline; it is a single  body with nothing to break it, and nothing to finish it at either end.  But its proportions within come somewhat nearer to Northern ideas than  is common in the Italian Gothic, and its apse specially reveals the  German hand to which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#1)"],[1,"[For those interested, there is a note at the end of  this document that details the adaptations made to this  work to fit it into plain ASCII text]                \"THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU\"  CHRISTIANITY NOT AS A MYSTIC RELIGION  BUT AS A NEW THEORY OF LIFE    TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN OF COUNT LEO TOLSTOI  BY CONSTANCE GARNETT  New York, 1894        TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.    The book I have had the privilege of translating is, undoubtedly,  one of the most remarkable studies of the social and psychological  condition of the modern world which has appeared in Europe for  many years, and its influence is sure to be lasting and far  reaching.  Tolstoi's genius is beyond dispute.  The verdict of the  civilized world has pronounced him as perhaps the greatest  novelist of our generation.  But the philosophical and religious  works of his later years have met with a somewhat indifferent  reception.  They have been much talked about, simply because they  were his work, but, as Tolstoi himself complains, they have never  been seriously discussed.  I hardly think that he will have to  repeat the complaint in regard to the present volume.  One may  disagree with his views, but no one can seriously deny the  originality, boldness, and depth of the social conception which he  develops with such powerful logic.  The novelist has shown in this  book the religious fervor and spiritual insight of the prophet;  yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is not wholly lost  in the thinker.  The subtle intuitive perception of the  psychological basis of the social position, the analysis of the  frame of mind of oppressors and oppressed, and of the intoxication  of Authority and Servility, as well as the purely descriptive  passages in the last chapter--these could only have come from the  author of \"War and Peace.\"    The book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of,  and must call forth much criticism.  It must be refuted by those  who disapprove of its teaching, if they do not want it to have  great influence.    One cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they  are to be influenced by ideas, and instinctively distrustful of  all that is logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt to  put Tolstoi's theory of life into practice.  But one may at least  be sure that his destructive criticism of the present social and  political REGIME will become a powerful force in the work of  disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around  us.  Many earnest thinkers who, like Tolstoi, are struggling to  find their way out of the contradictions of our social order will  hail him as their spiritual guide.  The individuality of the  author is felt in every line of his work, and even the most  prejudiced cannot resist the fascination of his genuineness,  sincerity, and profound earnestness.  Whatever comes from a heart  such as his, swelling with anger and pity at the sufferings of  humanity, cannot fail to reach the hearts of others.  No reader  can put down the book without feeling himself better and more  truth-loving for having read it.    Many readers may be disappointed with the opening chapters of the  book.  Tolstoi disdains all attempt to captivate the reader.  He  begins by laying what he considers to be the logical foundation of  his doctrines, stringing together quotations from little-known  theological writers, and he keeps his own incisive logic for the  later part of the book.    One word as to the translation.  Tolstoi's style in his religious  and philosophical works differs considerably from that of his  novels.  He no longer cares about the form of his work, and his  style is often slipshod, involved, and diffuse.  It has been my  aim to give a faithful reproduction of the original.    CONSTANCE GARNETT.  January, 1894          PREFACE.    In the year 1884 I wrote a book under the title \"What I Believe,\"  in which I did in fact make a sincere statement of my beliefs.    In affirming my belief in Christ's teaching, I could not help  explaining why I do not believe, and consider as mistaken, the  Church's doctrine, which is usually called Christianity.    Among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the  doctrine of Christ I pointed out as the principal one the absence  of any commandment of non-resistance to evil by force.  The  perversion of Christ's teaching by the teaching of the Church is  more clearly apparent in this than in any other point of  difference.    I know--as we all do--very little of the practice and the spoken and  written doctrine of former times on the subject of non-resistance to  evil. I knew what had been said on the subject by the fathers of the  Church--Origen, Tertullian, and others--I knew too of the existence of  some so-called sects of Mennonites, Herrnhuters, and Quakers, who do not  allow a Christian the use of weapons, and do not enter military service;  but I knew little of what had been done by these so-called sects toward  expounding the question.    My book was, as I had anticipated, suppressed by the Russian  censorship; but partly owing to my literary reputation, partly  because the book had excited people's curiosity, it circulated in  manuscript and in lithographed copies in Russia and through  translations abroad, and it evolved, on one side, from those who  shared my convictions, a series of essays with a great deal of  information on the subject, on the other side a series of  criticisms on the principles laid down in my book.    A great deal was made clear to me by both hostile and sympathetic  criticism, and also by the historical events of late years; and I  was led to fresh results and conclusions, which I wish now to  expound.    First I will speak of the information I received on the history of  the question of non-resistance to evil; then of the views of this  question maintained by spiritual critics, that is, by professed  believers in the Christian religion, and also by temporal ones,  that is, those who do not profess the Christian religion; and  lastly I will speak of the conclusions to which I have been  brought by all this in the light of the historical events of late  years.

THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN PROFESSED  BY A MINORITY OF MEN FROM THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY.    Of the Book \"What I Believe\"--The Correspondence Evoked by it--Letters  from Quakers--Garrison's Declaration--Adin Ballou, his Works, his  Catechism--Helchitsky's \"Net of Faith\"--The Attitude of the World to  Works Elucidating Christ's Teaching--Dymond's Book \"On War\"--Musser's  \"Non-resistance Asserted\"--Attitude of the Government in 1818 to Men who  Refused to Serve in the Army--Hostile Attitude of Governments Generally  and of Liberals to Those who Refuse to Assist in Acts of State Violence,  and their Conscious Efforts to Silence and Suppress these Manifestations  of Christian Non-resistance.      Among the first responses called forth by my book were some letters from  American Quakers. In these letters, expressing their sympathy with my  views on the unlawfulness for a Christian of war and the use of force of  any kind, the Quakers gave me details of their own so-called sect, which  for more than two hundred years has actually professed the teaching of  Christ on non-resistance to evil by force, and does not make use of  weapons in self-defense. The Quakers sent me books, from which I learnt  how they had, years ago, established beyond doubt the duty for a  Christian of fulfilling the command of non-resistance to evil by force,  and had exposed the error of the Church's teaching in allowing war and  capital punishment.    In a whole series of arguments and texts showing that war--that  is, the wounding and killing of men--is inconsistent with a  religion founded on peace and good will toward men, the Quakers  maintain and prove that nothing has contributed so much to the  obscuring of Christian truth in the eyes of the heathen, and has  hindered so much the diffusion of Christianity through the world,  as the disregard of this"]]]
