WITH NUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPS      VOL. VIII    SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS FUTURE      EDITED BY    LOUIS CRESWICKE      MANCHESTER: KENNETH MACLENNAN  75 PICCADILLY          PREFACE--VOL. VIII.      Everyone who has followed the story of the War in South Africa from  start to finish will assuredly have acquired a keen and lasting interest  in the land which has been won by the expenditure of so much blood and  treasure. Earnestly will he discuss in his mind all questions connected  with the development of the New Dominions of the King, and vigilantly  will he watch every action of the Government in regard to them.    In order rightly to estimate the difficulties to be overcome and the  issues to be hoped for, and to follow these questions with complete  apprehension, it is necessary to be familiar with their aspect in every  possible light. To this end, the Editor has invited the co-operation of  various well-known Authorities, each of whom has kindly contributed his  opinion on matters coming within his special experience.    The Publishers claim, therefore, that in this Volume is collected the  cream of modern thought, furnished at first-hand by those whose mastery  of their subject, and whose interest in the Empire, render them  competent to instruct in the intricacies of the South African problems,  with which for some time to come we must stand face-to-face. That these  writers do not on all points entirely agree is a matter for  congratulation, as readers are thus enabled to view the political  panorama from every reasonable standpoint, and weigh the pros and cons  of their arguments with perspicuity and without prejudice.    At the present juncture, when Mr. Chamberlain, the greatest of Colonial  Secretaries, is visiting South Africa, the Publishers are convinced that  this Volume is the most valuable book on the new Colonies that has yet  been offered to the Public.

Both had observed it, of course. It gave them a sort of  confidence in each other. Between them it hovered in a subtle and  unanalyzed presence that was constantly suggesting to Conniston a line  of action that would have made him a traitor to his oath of duty. For  nearly a month he had crushed down the whispered temptings of this  thing between them. He represented the law. He was the law. For  twenty-seven months he had followed Keith, and always there had been in  his mind that parting injunction of the splendid service of which he  was a part--\"Don't come back until you get your man, dead or alive.\"  Otherwise--    A racking cough split in upon his thoughts. He sat up on the edge of  the cot, and at the gasping cry of pain that came with the red stain of  blood on his lips Keith went to him and with a strong arm supported his  shoulders. He said nothing, and after a moment Conniston wiped the  stain away and laughed softly, even before the shadow of pain had faded  from his eyes. One of his hands rested on a wrist that still bore the  ring-mark of a handcuff. The sight of it brought him back to grim  reality. After all, fate was playing whimsically as well as tragically  with their destinies.    \"Thanks, old top,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"    His fingers closed over the manacle-marked wrist.    Over their heads the arctic storm was crashing in a mighty fury, as if  striving to beat down the little cabin that had dared to rear itself in  the dun-gray emptiness at the top of the world, eight hundred miles  from civilization. There were curious waitings, strange screeching  sounds, and heart-breaking meanings in its strife, and when at last its  passion died away and there followed a strange quiet, the two men could  feel the frozen earth under their feet shiver with the rumbling  reverberations of the crashing and breaking fields of ice out in  Hudson's Bay. With it came a dull and steady roar, like the incessant  rumble of a far battle, broken now and then--when an ice mountain split  asunder--with a report like that of a sixteen-inch gun. Down through  the Roes Welcome into Hudson's Bay countless billions of tons of ice  were rending their way like Hunnish armies in the break-up.    \"You'd better lie down,\" suggested Keith.    Conniston, instead, rose slowly to his feet and went to a table on  which a seal-oil lamp was burning. He swayed a little as he walked. He  sat down, and Keith seated himself opposite him. Between them lay a  worn deck of cards. As Conniston fumbled them in his fingers, he looked  straight across at Keith and grinned.    \"It's queer, devilish queer,\" he said.    \"Don't you think so, Keith?\" He was an Englishman, and his blue eyes  shone with a grim, cold humor. \"And funny,\" he added.    \"Queer, but not funny,\" partly agreed Keith.    \"Yes, it is funny,\" maintained Conniston. \"Just twenty-seven months  ago, lacking three days, I was sent out to get you, Keith. I was told  to bring you in dead or alive--and at the end of the twenty-sixth month  I got you, alive. And as a sporting proposition you deserve a hundred  years of life instead of the noose, Keith, for you led me a chase that  took me through seven different kinds of hell before I landed you. I  froze, and I starved, and I drowned. I haven't seen a white woman's  face in eighteen months. It was terrible. But I beat you at last.  That's the jolly good part of it, Keith--I beat you and GOT you, and  there's the proof of it on your wrists this minute. I won. Do you  concede that? You must be fair, old top, because this is the last big  game I'll ever play.\" There was a break, a yearning that was almost  plaintive, in his voice.    Keith nodded. \"You won,\" he said.    \"You won so square that when the frost got your lung--\"    \"You didn't take advantage of me,\" interrupted Conniston. \"That's the  funny part of it, Keith. That's where the humor comes in. I had you all  tied up and scheduled for the hangman when--bing!--along comes a cold  snap that bites a corner of my lung, and the tables are turned. And  instead of doing to me as I was going to do to you, instead of killing  me or making your getaway while I was helpless--Keith--old pal--YOU'VE  TRIED TO NURSE ME BACK TO LIFE! Isn't that funny? Could anything be  funnier?\"    He reached a hand across the table and gripped Keith's. And then, for a  few moments, he bowed his head while his body was convulsed by another  racking cough. Keith sensed the pain of it in the convulsive clutching  of Conniston's fingers about his own. When Conniston raised his face,  the red stain was on his lips again.    \"You see, I've got it figured out to the day,\" he went on, wiping away  the stain with a cloth already dyed red. \"This is Thursday. I won't see  another Sunday. It'll come Friday night or some time Saturday. I've  seen this frosted lung business a dozen times. Understand? I've got two  sure days ahead of me, possibly a third. Then you'll have to dig a hole  and bury me. After that you will no longer be held by the word of honor  you gave me when I slipped off your manacles. And I'm asking you--WHAT  ARE YOU GOING TO DO?\"    In Keith's face were written deeply the lines of suffering and of  tragedy. Yesterday they had compared ages.    He was thirty-eight, only a little younger than the man who had run him  down and who in the hour of his achievement was dying. They had not put  the fact plainly before. It had been a matter of some little  embarrassment for Keith, who at another time had found it easier to  kill a man than to tell this man that he was going to die. Now that  Conniston had measured his own span definitely and with most amazing  coolness, a load was lifted from Keith's shoulders. Over the table they  looked into each other's eyes, and this time it was Keith's fingers  that tightened about Conniston's. They looked like brothers in the  sickly glow of the seal-oil lamp.    \"What are you going to do?\" repeated Conniston.    Keith's face aged even as the dying Englishman stared at him. \"I  suppose--I'll go back,\" he said heavily.    \"You mean to Coronation Gulf? You'll return to that stinking mess of  Eskimo igloos? If you do, you'll go mad!\"    \"I expect to,\" said Keith. \"But it's the only thing left. You know  that. You of all men must know how they've hunted me. If I went south--\"    It was Conniston's turn to nod his head, slowly and thoughtfully. \"Yes,  of course,\" he agreed. \"They're hunting you hard, and you're giving 'em  a bully chase. But they'll get you, even up there. And I'm--sorry.\"    Their hands unclasped. Conniston filled his pipe and lighted it. Keith  noticed that he held the lighted taper without a tremor. The nerve of  the man was magnificent.    \"I'm sorry,\" he said again. \"I--like you. Do you know, Keith, I wish  we'd been born brothers and you hadn't killed a man. That night I  slipped the ring-dogs on you I felt almost like a devil. I wouldn't say  it if it wasn't for this bally lung. But what's the use of keeping it  back now? It doesn't seem fair to keep a man up in that place for three  years, running from hole to hole like a rat, and then take him down for  a hanging. I know it isn't fair in your case. I feel it. I don't mean  to be inquisitive, old chap, but I'm not believing Departmental 'facts'  any more. I'd make a topping good wager you're not the sort they make  you out. And so I'd like to know--just why--you killed Judge Kirkstone?\"    Keith's two fists knotted in the center of the table. Conniston saw his  blue eyes darken for an instant with a savage fire. In that moment  there came a strange silence over the cabin, and in that silence the  incessant and maddening yapping of the little white foxes rose shrilly  over the distant booming and rumbling of the ice.          II      \"Why did I kill Judge Kirkstone?\" Keith repeated the words slowly.    His clenched hands relaxed, but his eyes held the steady glow of fire.  \"What do the Departmental 'facts' tell you, Conniston?\"    \"That you murdered him in cold blood, and that the honor of the Service  is at stake until you are hung.\"    \"There's a lot in the view-point, isn't there? What if I said I didn't  kill Judge Kirkstone?\"    Conniston leaned forward a little too eagerly. The deadly paroxysm  shook his frame again, and when it was over his breath came pantingly,  as if hissing through a sieve. \"My God, not Sunday--or Saturday,\" he  breathed. \"Keith, it's coming TOMORROW!\"    \"No, no, not then,\" said Keith, choking back something that rose in his  throat. \"You'd better lie down again.\"    Conniston gathered new strength. \"And die like a rabbit? No, thank you,  old chap! I'm after facts, and you can't lie to a dying man. Did you  kill Judge Kirkstone?\"    \"I--don't--know,\" replied Keith slowly, looking steadily into the  other's eyes. \"I think so, and yet I am not positive. I went to his  home that night with the determination to wring justice from him or  kill him. I wish you could look at it all with my eyes, Conniston. You  could if you had known my father. You see, my mother died when I was a  little chap, and my father and I grew up together, chums. I don't  believe I ever thought of him as just simply a father. Fathers are  common. He was more than that. From the time I was ten years old we  were inseparable. I guess I was twenty before he told me of the deadly  feud that existed between him and Kirkstone, and it never troubled me  much--because I didn't think anything would ever come of it--until  Kirkstone got him. Then I realized that all through the years the old  rattlesnake had been watching for his chance. It was a frame-up from  beginning to end, and my father stepped into the trap. Even then he  thought that his political enemies, and not"]]]
