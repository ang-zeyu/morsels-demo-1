I shall commence this chapter by a description of Spanish Guiana  (Provincia de la Guyana), which is a part of the ancient Capitania  general of Caracas. Since the end of the sixteenth century three towns  have successively borne the name of St. Thomas of Guiana. The first  was situated opposite to the island of Faxardo, at the confluence of  the Carony and the Orinoco, and was destroyed* by the Dutch, under the  command of Captain Adrian Janson, in 1579. (* The first of the voyages  undertaken at Raleigh's expense was in 1595; the second, that of  Laurence Keymis, in 1596; the third, described by Thomas Masham, in  1597; and the fourth, in 1617. The first and last only were performed  by Raleigh in person. This celebrated man was beheaded on October the  29th, 1618. It is therefore the second town of Santo Tomas, now called  Vieja Guyana, which existed in the time of Raleigh.) The second,  founded by Antonio de Berrio in 1591, near twelve leagues east of the  mouth of the Carony, made a courageous resistance to Sir Walter  Raleigh, whom the Spanish writers of the conquest know only by the  name of the pirate Reali. The third town, now the capital of the  province, is fifty leagues west of the confluence of the Carony. It  was begun in 1764, under the Governor Don Joacquin Moreno de Mendoza,  and is distinguished in the public documents from the second town,  vulgarly called the fortress (el castillo, las fortalezas), or Old  Guayana (Vieja Guayana), by the name of Santo Thome de la Nueva  Guayana. This name being very long, that of Angostura* (the strait)  has been commonly substituted for it. (* Europe has learnt the  existence of the town of Angostura by the trade carried on by the  Catalonians in the Carony bark, which is the beneficial bark of the  Bonplanda trifoliata. This bark, coming from Nueva Guiana, was called  corteza or cascarilla del Angostura (Cortex Angosturae). Botanists so  little guessed the origin of this geographical denomination that they  began by writing Augustura, and then Augusta.)    Angostura, the longitude and latitude of which I have already  indicated from astronomical observations, stands at the foot of a hill  of amphibolic schist* bare of vegetation. (* Hornblendschiefer.) The  streets are regular, and for the most part parallel with the course of  the river. Several of the houses are built on the bare rock; and here,  as at Carichana, and in many other parts of the missions, the action  of black and strong strata, when strongly heated by the rays of the  sun upon the atmosphere, is considered injurious to health. I think  the small pools of stagnant water (lagunas y anegadizos), which extend  behind the town in the direction of south-east, are more to be feared.  The houses of Angostura are lofty and convenient; they are for the  most part built of stone; which proves that the inhabitants have but  little dread of earthquakes. But unhappily this security is not  founded on induction from any precise data. It is true that the shore  of Nueva Andalusia sometimes undergoes very violent shocks, without  the commotion being propagated across the Llanos. The fatal  catastrophe of Cumana, on the 4th of February, 1797, was not felt at  Angostura; but in the great earthquake of 1766, which destroyed the  same city, the granitic soil of the two banks of the Orinoco was  agitated as far as the Raudales of Atures and Maypures. South of these  Raudales shocks are sometimes felt, which are confined to the basin of  the Upper Orinoco and the Rio Negro. They appear to depend on a  volcanic focus distant from that of the Caribbee Islands. We were told  by the missionaries at Javita and San Fernando de Atabapo that in 1798  violent earthquakes took place between the Guaviare and the Rio Negro,  which were not propagated on the north towards Maypures. We cannot be  sufficiently attentive to whatever relates to the simultaneity of the  oscillations, and to the independence of the movements in contiguous  ground. Everything seems to prove that the propagation of the  commotion is not superficial, but depends on very deep crevices that  terminate in different centres of action.    The scenery around the town of Angostura is little varied; but the  view of the river, which forms a vast canal, stretching from  south-west to north-east, is singularly majestic.    When the waters are high, the river inundates the quays; and it  sometimes happens that, even in the town, imprudent persons become the  prey of crocodiles. I shall transcribe from my journal a fact that  took place during M. Bonpland's illness. A Guaykeri Indian, from the  island of La Margareta, was anchoring his canoe in a cove where there  were not three feet of water. A very fierce crocodile, which  habitually haunted that spot, seized him by the leg, and withdrew from  the shore, remaining on the surface of the water. The cries of the  Indian drew together a crowd of spectators. This unfortunate man was  first seen seeking, with astonishing presence of mind, for a knife  which he had in his pocket. Not being able to find it, he seized the  head of the crocodile and thrust his fingers into its eyes. No man in  the hot regions of America is ignorant that this carnivorous reptile,  covered with a buckler of hard and dry scales, is extremely sensitive  in the only parts of his body which are soft and unprotected, such as  the eyes, the hollow underneath the shoulders, the nostrils, and  beneath the lower jaw, where there are two glands of musk. The  Guaykeri Indian was less fortunate than the negro of Mungo Park, and  the girl of Uritucu, whom I mentioned in a former part of this work,  for the crocodile did not open its jaws and lose hold of its prey. The  animal, overcome by pain, plunged to the bottom of the river, and,  after having drowned the Indian, came up to the surface of the water,  dragging the dead body to an island opposite the port. A great number  of the inhabitants of Angostura witnessed this melancholy spectacle.    The crocodile, owing to the structure of its larynx, of the hyoidal  bone, and of the folds of its tongue, can seize, though not swallow,  its prey under water; thus when a man disappears, the animal is  usually perceived some hours after devouring its prey on a  neighbouring beach. The number of individuals who perish annually, the  victims of their own imprudence and of the ferocity of these reptiles,  is much greater than is believed in Europe. It is particularly so in  villages where the neighbouring grounds are often inundated. The same  crocodiles remain long in the same places. They become from year to  year more daring, especially, as the Indians assert, if they have once  tasted of human flesh. These animals are so wary, that they are killed  with difficulty.

In the Introduction to the first volume of the translation of the  'Vedânta-Sûtras with Sankara's Commentary' (vol. xxxiv of this Series) I  have dwelt at some length on the interest which Râmânuja's Commentary  may claim--as being, on the one hand, the fullest exposition of what may  be called the Theistic Vedânta, and as supplying us, on the other, with  means of penetrating to the true meaning of Bâdarâyana's Aphorisms. I do  not wish to enter here into a fuller discussion of Râmânuja's work in  either of these aspects; an adequate treatment of them would, moreover,  require considerably more space than is at my disposal. Some very useful  material for the right understanding of Râmânuju's work is to be found  in the 'Analytical Outline of Contents' which Messrs. M. Rangâkârya and  M. B. Varadarâja Aiyangâr have prefixed to the first volume of their  scholarly translation of the Srîbhâshya (Madras, 1899).    The question as to what the Stûras really teach is a critical, not a  philosophical one. This distinction seems to have been imperfectly  realised by several of those critics, writing in India, who have  examined the views expressed in my Introduction to the translation of  Sankara's Commentary. A writer should not be taxed with 'philosophic  incompetency,' 'hopeless theistic bias due to early training,' and the  like, simply because he, on the basis of a purely critical investigation,  considers himself entitled to maintain that a certain ancient document  sets forth one philosophical view rather than another. I have nowhere  expressed an opinion as to the comparative philosophical value of the  systems of Sankara and Râmânuja; not because I have no definite opinions  on this point, but because to introduce them into a critical enquiry  would be purposeless if not objectionable.    The question as to the true meaning of the Sûtras is no doubt of some  interest; although the interest of problems of this kind may easily be  over-estimated. Among the remarks of critics on my treatment of this  problem I have found little of solid value. The main arguments which I  have set forth, not so much in favour of the adequacy of Râmânuja's  interpretation, as against the validity of Sankarâkârya's understanding  of the Sûtras, appear to me not to have been touched. I do not by any  means consider the problem a hopeless one; but its solution will not be  advanced, in any direction, but by those who will be at the trouble of  submitting the entire body of the Sûtras to a new and detailed  investigation, availing themselves to the full of the help that is to be  derived from the study of all the existing Commentaries.    The present translation of the Srîbhâshya claims to be faithful on the  whole, although I must acknowledge that I have aimed rather at making it  intelligible and, in a certain sense, readable than scrupulously  accurate. If I had to rewrite it, I should feel inclined to go even  further in the same direction. Indian Philosophy would, in my opinion,  be more readily and widely appreciated than it is at present, if the  translators of philosophical works had been somewhat more concerned to  throw their versions into a form less strange and repellent to the  western reader than literal renderings from technical Sanskrit must  needs be in many passages. I am not unaware of the peculiar dangers of  the plan now advocated--among which the most obvious is the temptation  it offers to the translator of deviating from the text more widely than  regard for clearness would absolutely require. And I am conscious of  having failed in this respect in more than one instance. In other cases  I have no doubt gone astray through an imperfect understanding of the  author's meaning. The fact is, that as yet the time has hardly come for  fully adequate translations of comprehensive works of the type of the  Srîbhâshya, the authors of which wrote with reference--in many cases  tacit--to an immense and highly technical philosophical literature which  is only just beginning to be studied, and comprehended in part, by  European scholars.    It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the help which I have received  from various quarters in preparing this translation. Pandit Gangâdhara  Sâstrin, C. I. E., of the Benares Sanskrit College, has, with unwearying  kindness and patience, supplied me throughout with comments of his own  on difficult sections of the text. Pandit Svâmin Râma Misra Sâstrin has  rendered me frequent assistance in the earlier portion of my task. And  to Mr. A. Venis, the learned Principal of the Benares Sanskrit College,  I am indebted for most instructive notes on some passages of a  peculiarly technical and abstruse character. Nor can I conclude without  expressing my sense of obligation to Colonel G. A. Jacob, whose  invaluable 'Concordance to the Principal Upanishads' lightens to an  incalculable degree the task of any scholar who is engaged in work  bearing on the Vedânta.          VEDÂNTA-SÛTRAS    WITH    RÂMÂNUJA'S SRÎBHÂSHYA    FIRST ADHYÂYA.    FIRST PÂDA.    MAY my mind be filled with devotion towards the highest Brahman, the  abode of Lakshmi who is luminously revealed in the Upanishads; who in  sport produces, sustains, and reabsorbs the entire Universe; whose only  aim is to foster the manifold classes of beings that humbly worship him.    The nectar of the teaching of Parâsara's son (Vyâsa),--which was brought  up from the middle of the milk-ocean of the Upanishads--which restores  to life the souls whose vital strength had departed owing to the heat of  the fire of transmigratory existence--which was well guarded by the  teachers of old--which was obscured by the mutual conflict of manifold  opinions,--may intelligent men daily enjoy that as it is now presented  to them in my words.    The lengthy explanation (vritti) of the Brahma-sûtras which was composed  by the Reverend Bodhâyana has been abridged by former teachers;  according to their views the words of the Sûtras will be explained in  this present work.          1. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman.    In this Sûtra the word 'then' expresses immediate sequence; the word  'therefore' intimates that what has taken place (viz. the study of the  karmakânda of the Veda) constitutes the reason (of the enquiry into  Brahman). For the fact is that the enquiry into (lit.'the desire to  know') Brahman--the fruit of which enquiry is infinite in nature and  permanent--follows immediately in the case of him who, having read the  Veda together with its auxiliary disciplines, has reached the knowledge  that the fruit of mere works is limited and non-permanent, and hence has  conceived the desire of final release.    The compound 'brahmajijñâsâ' is to be explained as 'the enquiry of  Brahman,' the genitive case 'of Brahman' being understood to denote the  object; in agreement with the special rule as to the meaning of the  genitive case, Pânini II, 3, 65. It might be said that even if we  accepted the general meaning of the genitive case--which is that of  connexion in general--Brahman's position (in the above compound) as an  object would be established by the circumstance that the 'enquiry'  demands an object; but in agreement with the principle that the direct  denotation of a word is to be preferred to a meaning inferred we take  the genitive case 'of Brahman' as denoting the object.    The word 'Brahman' denotes the hightest Person (purushottama), who is  essentially free from all imperfections and possesses numberless classes  of auspicious qualities of unsurpassable excellence. The term 'Brahman'  is applied to any things which possess the quality of greatness  (brihattva, from the root 'brih'); but primarily denotes that which  possesses greatness, of essential nature as well as of qualities, in  unlimited fulness; and such is only the Lord of all. Hence the word  'Brahman' primarily denotes him alone, and in a secondary derivative  sense only those things which possess some small part of the Lord's  qualities; for it would be improper to assume several meanings for the  word (so that it would denote primarily or directly more than one thing).  The case is analogous to that of the term 'bhagavat [FOOTNOTE 4:1].' The  Lord only is enquired into, for the sake of immortality, by all those  who are afflicted with the triad of pain. Hence the Lord of all is that  Brahman which, according to the Sûtra, constitutes the object of enquiry.  The word 'jijñâsâ' is a desiderative formation meaning 'desire to know.'  And as in the case of any desire the desired object is the chief thing,  the Sûtra means to enjoin knowledge--which is the object of the desire  of knowledge. The purport of the entire Sûtra then is as follows: 'Since  the fruit of works known through the earlier part of the Mîmâmsâ is  limited and non-permanent,"]]]
