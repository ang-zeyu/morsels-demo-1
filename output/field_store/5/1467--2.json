Book 20        Proverbs    20:001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;    20:001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of             understanding;    20:001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,             and equity;    20:001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and             discretion.    20:001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of             understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:    20:001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of             the wise, and their dark sayings.    20:001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools             despise wisdom and instruction.    20:001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not             the law of thy mother:    20:001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and             chains about thy neck.    20:001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.    20:001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us             lurk privily for the innocent without cause:    20:001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those             that go down into the pit:    20:001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses             with spoil:    20:001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:    20:001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot             from their path:    20:001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.    20:001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.    20:001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for             their own lives.    20:001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which             taketh away the life of the owners thereof.    20:001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:    20:001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of             the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,    20:001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the             scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?    20:001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto             you, I will make known my words unto you.    20:001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my             hand, and no man regarded;    20:001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my             reproof:    20:001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear             cometh;    20:001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction             cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon             you.    20:001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they             shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:    20:001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of             the LORD:    20:001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.    20:001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be             filled with their own devices.    20:001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the             prosperity of fools shall destroy them.    20:001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be             quiet from fear of evil.    20:002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my             commandments with thee;    20:002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine             heart to understanding;    20:002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice             for understanding;    20:002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for             hid treasures;    20:002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the             knowledge of God.    20:002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge             and understanding.    20:002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler             to them that walk uprightly.    20:002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of             his saints.    20:002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and             equity; yea, every good path.    20:002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is             pleasant unto thy soul;    20:002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:    20:002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man             that speaketh froward things;    20:002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of             darkness;    20:002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the             wicked;    20:002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:    20:002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger             which flattereth with her words;    20:002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the             covenant of her God.    20:002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the             dead.    20:002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of             the paths of life.    20:002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the             paths of the righteous.    20:002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall             remain in it.    20:002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the             transgressors shall be rooted out of it.    20:003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my             commandments:    20:003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add             to thee.    20:003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy             neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:    20:003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight             of God and man.    20:003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto             thine own understanding.    20:003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy             paths.    20:003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from             evil.    20:003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.    20:003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits             of all thine increase:    20:003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses             shall burst out with new wine.    20:003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be             weary of his correction:    20:003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the             son in whom he delighteth.    20:003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth             understanding.    20:003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of             silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.    20:003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou             canst desire are not to be compared unto her.    20:003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand             riches and honour.    20:003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are             peace.    20:003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and             happy is every one that retaineth her.    20:003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding             hath he established the heavens.    20:003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop             down the dew.    20:003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom             and discretion:    20:003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.    20:003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not             stumble.    20:003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou             shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.    20:003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the             wicked, when it cometh.    20:003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot             from being taken.    20:003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in             the power of thine hand to do it.    20:003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow             I will give; when thou hast it by thee.    20:003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth             securely by thee.    20:003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no             harm.    20:003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.    20:003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is             with the righteous.    20:003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he             blesseth the habitation of the just.    20:003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the             lowly.    20:003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion             of fools.    20:004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to             know understanding.    20:004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.    20:004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the             sight "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8021"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 21: Ecclesiastes (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by David Widger  with the help of Derek Andrew's text from January 1992  and the work of Bryan Taylor in November 2002.            Book 21        Ecclesiastes    21:001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in             Jerusalem.    21:001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;             all is vanity.    21:001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under             the sun?    21:001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:             but the earth abideth for ever.    21:001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to             his place where he arose.    21:001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the             north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth             again according to his circuits.    21:001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto             the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return             again.    21:001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is             not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.    21:001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that             which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new             thing under the sun.    21:001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?             it hath been already of old time, which was before us.    21:001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there             be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that             shall come after.    21:001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.    21:001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom             concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore             travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised             therewith.    21:001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,             behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.    21:001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which             is wanting cannot be numbered.    21:001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great             estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have             been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great             experience of wisdom and knowledge.    21:001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and             folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.    21:001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth             knowledge increaseth sorrow.    21:002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,             therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.    21:002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?    21:002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet             acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,             till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which             they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.    21:002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me             vineyards:    21:002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of             all kind of fruits:    21:002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that             bringeth forth trees:    21:002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my             house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle             above all that were in Jerusalem before me:    21:002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure             of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women             singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical             instruments, and that of all sorts.    21:002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before             me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.    21:002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I             withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in             all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.    21:002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and             on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was             vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under             the sun.    21:002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:             for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that             which hath been already done.    21:002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light             excelleth darkness.    21:002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in             darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth             to them all.    21:002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it             happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I             said in my heart, that this also is vanity.    21:002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool             for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall             all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.    21:002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under             the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of             spirit.    21:002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:             because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.    21:002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet             shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,             and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is             also vanity.    21:002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the             labour which I took under the sun.    21:002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in             knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured             therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity             and a great evil.    21:002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of             his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?    21:002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his             heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.    21:002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and             drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his             labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.    21:002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?    21:002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and             knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to             gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good             before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.    21:003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose             under the heaven:    21:003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a             time to pluck up that which is planted;    21:003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and             a time to build up;    21:003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a             time to dance;    21:003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones             together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from             embracing;    21:003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time             to cast away;    21:003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and             a time to speak;    21:003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time             of peace.    21:003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?    21:003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of             men to be exercised in it.    21:003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath             set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the             work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.    21:003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to             rejoice, and to do good in his life.    21:003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the             good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.    21:003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:             nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God             doeth it, that men should fear before him.    21:003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath             already been; and God requireth that which is past.    21:003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that             wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that             iniquity was there.    21:003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the             wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for             every work.    21:003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,             that God might manifest them, and that they might see that             they themselves are beasts.    21:003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;             even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the             other; yea, they have all one breath; so"]]]
