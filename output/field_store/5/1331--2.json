D.W.]                                       THE SATYRICON OF                             PETRONIUS ARBITER              Complete and unexpurgated translation by W. C. Firebaugh,            in which are incorporated the forgeries of Nodot and Marchena,            and the readings introduced into the text by De Salas.      Among the difficulties which beset the path of the conscientious  translator, a sense of his own unworthiness must ever take precedence;  but another, scarcely less disconcerting, is the likelihood of  misunderstanding some allusion which was perfectly familiar to the author  and his public, but which, by reason of its purely local significance,  is obscure and subject to the misinterpretation and emendation of a later  generation.    A translation worthy of the name is as much the product of a literary  epoch as it is of the brain and labor of a scholar; and Melmouth's  version of the letters of Pliny the Younger, made, as it was, at a  period when the art of English letter writing had attained its highest  excellence, may well be the despair of our twentieth century apostles of  specialization.  Who, today, could imbue a translation of the Golden Ass  with the exquisite flavor of William Adlington's unscholarly version of  that masterpiece?  Who could rival Arthur Golding's rendering of the  Metamorphoses of Ovid, or Francis Hicke's masterly rendering of Lucian's  True History?  But eternal life means endless change and in nothing is  this truth more strikingly manifest than in the growth and decadence of  living languages and in the translation of dead tongues into the ever  changing tissue of the living.  Were it not for this, no translation  worthy of the name would ever stand in need of revision, except in  instances where the discovery and collation of fresh manuscripts had  improved the text.  In the case of an author whose characters speak in  the argot proper to their surroundings, the necessity for revision is  even more imperative; the change in the cultured speech of a language is  a process that requires years to become pronounced, the evolution of  slang is rapid and its usage ephemeral.  For example Stephen Gaselee, in  his bibliography of Petronius, calls attention to Harry Thurston Peck's  rendering of \"bell um pomum\" by \"he's a daisy,\" and remarks,  appropriately enough, \"that this was well enough for 1898; but we would  now be more inclined to render it 'he's a peach.'\"  Again, Peck renders  \"illud erat vivere\" by \"that was life,\" but, in the words of our lyric  American jazz, we would be more inclined to render it \"that was the  life.\"  \"But,\" as Professor Gaselee has said, \"no rendering of this part  of the Satyricon can be final, it must always be in the slang of the  hour.\"    \"Some,\" writes the immortal translator of Rabelais, in his preface,  \"have deservedly gained esteem by translating; yet not many condescend  to translate but such as cannot invent; though to do the first well,  requires often as much genius as to do the latter.  I wish, reader,  thou mayest be as willing to do the author justice, as I have strove  to do him right.\"    Many scholars have lamented the failure of Justus Lipsius to comment upon  Petronius or edit an edition of the Satyricon.  Had he done so, he might  have gone far toward piercing the veil of darkness which enshrouds the  authorship of the work and the very age in which the composer flourished.  To me, personally, the fact that Laurence Sterne did not undertake a  version, has caused much regret.  The master who delineated Tristram  Shandy's father and the intrigue between the Widow Wadman and Uncle Toby  would have drawn Trimalchio and his peers to admiration.

Of the many masterpieces which classical antiquity has bequeathed to  modern times, few have attained, at intervals, to such popularity; few  have so gripped the interest of scholars and men of letters, as has this  scintillating miscellany known as the Satyricon, ascribed by tradition to  that Petronius who, at the court of Nero, acted as arbiter of elegance  and dictator of fashion.  The flashing, wit, the masterly touches which  bring out the characters with all the detail of a fine old copper  etching; the marvelous use of realism by this, its first prophet; the  sure knowledge of the perspective and background best adapted to each  episode; the racy style, so smooth, so elegant, so simple when the  educated are speaking, beguile the reader and blind him, at first, to the  many discrepancies and incoherences with which the text, as we have it,  is marred.  The more one concentrates upon this author, the more apparent  these faults become and the more one regrets the lacunae in the text.  Notwithstanding numerous articles which deal with this work, some from  the pens of the most profound scholars, its author is still shrouded in  the mists of uncertainty and conjecture.  He is as impersonal as  Shakespeare, as aloof as Flaubert, in the opinion of Charles Whibley,  and, it may be added, as genial as Rabelais; an enigmatic genius whose  secret will never be laid bare with the resources at our present command.  As I am not writing for scholars, I do not intend going very deeply into  the labyrinth of critical controversy which surrounds the author and the  work, but I shall deal with a few of the questions which, if properly  understood, will enhance the value of the Satyricon, and contribute, in  some degree, to a better understanding of the author.  For the sake of  convenience the questions discussed in this introduction will be arranged  in the following order:    1.  The Satyricon.    2.  The Author.       a  His Character.       b  His Purpose in Writing.       c  Time in which the Action is placed.       d  Localization of the Principal Episode.    3.  Realism.       a  Influence of the Satyricon upon the Literature of the World.    4.  The Forgeries.        I    THE SATYRICON.  Heinsius and Scaliger derive the word from the Greek,  whence comes our English word satyr, but Casaubon, Dacier and Spanheim  derive it from the Latin 'satura,' a plate filled with different kinds  of food, and they refer to Porphyrion's 'multis et variis rebus hoc  carmen refertum est.'    The text, as we possess it, may be divided into three divisions: the  first and last relate the adventures of Encolpius and his companions, the  second, which is a digression, describes the Dinner of Trimalchio.  That  the work was originally divided into books, we had long known from  ancient glossaries, and we learn, from the title of the Traguriensian  manuscript, that the fragments therein contained are excerpts from the  fifteenth and sixteenth books.  An interpolation of Fulgentius (Paris  7975) attributes to Book Fourteen the scene related in Chapter 20 of the  work as we have it, and the glossary of St. Benedict Floriacensis cites  the passage 'sed video te totum in illa haerere, quae Troiae halosin  ostendit (Chapter 89), as from Book Fifteen.  As there is no reason to  suppose that the chapters intervening between the end of the Cena  (Chapter 79) and Chapter 89 are out of place, it follows that this  passage may have belonged to Book Sixteen, or even Seventeen, but that it  could not have belonged to Book Fifteen.  From the interpolation of  Fulgentius we may hazard the opinion that the beginning of the fragments,  as we possess them (Chapters 1 to 26), form part of Book Fourteen.  The  Dinner of Trimalchio probably formed a complete book, fifteen, and the  continuation of the adventures of Encolpius down to his meeting with  Eumolpus (end of Chapter 140) Book Sixteen.  The discomfiture of Eumolpus  should have closed this book but not the entire work, as the exit of the  two principal characters is not fixed at the time our fragments come to  an end.  The original work, then, would probably have exceeded Tom Jones  in length.        II    THE AUTHOR.    a--\"Not often,\" says Studer (Rheinisches Museum, 1843), \"has there been  so much dispute about the author, the times, the character and the  purpose of a writing of antiquity as about the fragments of the Satyricon  of Petronius.\"  The discovery and publication of the Trau manuscript  brought about a literary controversy which has had few parallels, and  which has not entirely died out to this day, although the best  authorities ascribe the work to Caius Petronius, the Arbiter Elegantiarum  at the court of Nero.  \"The question as to the date of the narrative of  the adventures of Encolpius and his boon companions must be regarded as  settled,\" says Theodor Mommsen (Hermes, 1878); \"this narrative is  unsurpassed in originality and mastery of treatment among the writings of  Roman literature.  Nor does anyone doubt the identity of its author and  the Arbiter Elegantiarum of Nero, whose end Tacitus relates.\"    In any case, the author of this work, if it be the work of one brain,  must have been a profound psychologist, a master of realism, a  natural-born story teller, and a gentleman.      b--His principal object in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#1)"],[1,"BOOK OF GOOD MANNERS    A GUIDE TO POLITE USAGE  FOR ALL SOCIAL FUNCTIONS    W.

ACCEPTING OR DECLINING INVITATIONS. See INVITATIONS,         ACCEPTING OR DECLINING.        ACCIDENTS. See STREET ETIQUETTE--MEN--ACCIDENTS.        ADDRESS. The address of a person may be stamped         on the stationery.           If the address is stamped, it is not customary         to stamp also the crest or monogram.        ADDRESSING ENVELOPES.      MEN. A man should be addressed as Mr. James         J, Wilson, or James J. Wilson, Esq. Either         the Mr. or the Esq. may be used, but not         the two together.           The title belonging to a man should be         given. It is not customary to use Mr. or         Esq. when Jr. or Sr. is used.      WOMEN. A woman's name should always have         the Miss or Mrs.           A woman should never be given her husband's         official title, as Mrs. Judge Wilson.           If a woman has a title of her own, she         should be addressed as Dr. Minnie Wilson,         when the letter is a professional one. If         a social letter, this should be Miss Minnie         Wilson, or Mrs. Minnie Wilson.        ADDRESSING PERSONS. Young girls should be spoken         of as Minnie Wilson, and not as Miss Minnie,         but are personally addressed as Miss Minnie.         Only the greatest intimacy warrants a man         in addressing a young girl as Minnie.           Parents should introduce their daughter         as My daughter Minnie, but should speak         of them before servants as Miss Minnie.           A married woman should be spoken of as         Mrs. Agnes Wilson, and personally addressed         as Mrs. Wilson.        ADDRESSING AND SIGNING LETTERS. All answers to         invitations should be addressed to the party         issuing them.           Letters to a woman who is a comparative         stranger may begin My dear Mrs. Wilson,         and to a closer acquaintance Dear Mrs.         Wilson.           Letters to a man who is a comparative         stranger may begin My dear Mr. Wilson,         and to a closer acquaintance Dear Mr.         Wilson.           For forms of addressing persons with titles,         as Mayor, see under that title--as, Mayor,         Governor.           The letters may end, Sincerely yours, or         Very truly yours, or I remain yours with         kindest regards.           The signature of a man should be John J.         Wilson or J. Jones Wilson.           An unmarried woman should sign social         letters as Minnie Wilson, and a business letter         as Miss Minnie Wilson. A married woman         should sign a social letter as Agnes Wilson.         In signing a business letter, a married woman         may either sign her name Mrs. Agnes Wilson,         or, preferably,           Agnes Wilson         (Mrs. John Wilson)        AFTERNOON CALLS. These should be made between         three and half-past five, and if possible on         regular at home days.           In making an afternoon call a man should         wear the regulation afternoon dress.      DRESS--MEN. Afternoon dress consists of a         double-breasted frock coat of dark material,         and waistcoat, either single or double-         breasted, of same, or of some fancy material         of late design. The trousers should be of         light color, avoiding of course extremes in         patterns.           White or delicate color linen shirts should         be worn, patent leather shoes, silk hat and         undressed kid gloves of dark color.           Afternoon dress is worn at weddings, afternoon         teas, receptions, garden parties, luncheons,         church funerals, and at all afternoon         functions.             See also EVENING DRESS--MEN. MORNING           DRESS--MEN.        AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS. See AFTERNOON TEAS.    GIVEN BY BACHELORS, See BACHELORS' TEAS.        AFTERNOON TEAS (FORMAL). These are very successful         as a rule, due perhaps to their small expense         and few exactions, and are given with         many purposes: to introduce young women         into society, to allow a hostess to entertain a         number of her friends, to honor some woman         of note, etc.           A formal afternoon tea is one for which         cards have been issued, naming set date.           Awnings and carpet should be provided         from curb to house. A man should be stationed         at the curb to open carriage doors and         call them when the guests leave, and another         African Teas man should be in attendance at the         front door to open it the moment a guest appears         at the top step and to direct him to the dressing-room.           A policeman should be detailed for the occasion         to keep back the onlookers, and should         receive a small fee for his services.           At the door of the drawing-room a man         should ask the name of each guest, which he         announces as the latter enters. The hostess         and those receiving with her should be just         within the door to receive the guests.      CARDS. Each guest should leave a card in the         tray in the hall.           A woman may leave the cards of the men         of her family who have been unable to attend.           Cards should be sent by mail or messenger         by those invited but unable to be present, and         should be timed so that they reach the house         during the function.           A husband and wife each send a card when         the invitation is issued in the name of the         hostess only, and two cards each when issued         in the name of hostess and her daughter. If         issued in the name of both husband and         wife, a husband should send two and his wife         should send one card.      DAUGHTERS. The daughters who have passed         the debutante age usually stand for an hour         beside their mother to receive the guests,         and afterward mingle with the guests to help         to make the function a success.      DEBUTANTE. When a tea is given in honor of         a debutante, she stands beside the hostess         (usually her mother), and each guest is introduced         to her. Flowers should be liberally         provided, and friends may contribute on such         an occasion.           The host and the men all wear the regulation         afternoon dress.           Women wear costumes appropriate to the         afternoon, more elegant in proportion to the         elaborateness of the function.           Guests may suit their convenience in         arriving, provided they do not come at the         opening hour nor at the very end.           After leaving their wraps in the dressing-         rooms, guests enter the drawing-room, leaving         their cards in the tray in the hall, and         then giving their names to the man at the         door, who announces them.           On entering the room, the women precede         the men.           After greeting the hostess and being introduced         to those receiving with her, the guests         move into the middle of the room.           Guests go the dining-room when they         wish without greeting the hostess.           It is not expected that guests at a large reception         will stay all the afternoon. Twenty         minutes is long enough. It is not necessary         to bid the hostess good-bye when leaving.         If guests take leave of host and hostess,         they should shake hands.           In the dining-room the men, assisted by         the waiters, help the women.           When the reception is a small formal one,         the guests may stay a longer time, and usually         it is better to take leave of the hostess,         unless she is much occupied at the time.      HOST. Except when a newly married couple         give a house-warming or a reception, the host         does not stand beside his wife, but spends         the time in making introductions, and doing         his best to make the function a success.           When some married woman or woman         guest of honor assists his wife to receive, he         should at the proper moment escort her to         the dining-room.      HOSTESS. The hostess and those receiving with         her should be just within the door, ready to         receive each guest as announced.           The hostess shakes hands with each guest,         and introduces them to those receiving with         her.           Friends assisting a hostess to entertain are         generally permitted to invite a few of their         own friends, and their cards are sent with         those of the hostess. A pretty feature is the         presence of a number of young women here         and there in the rooms to assist in receiving         the guests. Music is always appropriate.      HOURS. The hours are from 4 to 7 P.M.      INTRODUCTIONS. The hostess should introduce         her guests to those receiving with her.           See also INTRODUCTION.      INVITATIONS. Engraved invitations are sent a         week or ten days in advance, by mail or messenger.           They are usually issued in the name of the         hostess only, though they may be issued in         the name of both husband and wife.           In place of the visiting-card, an \"At         Home\" card may be used, or cards specially         engraved for the purpose.           When cards are sent to a married couple,         the cards are addressed to both husband and         wife.           Invitations are sent in two envelopes-the         inner one"]]]
