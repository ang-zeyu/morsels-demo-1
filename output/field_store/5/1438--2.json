The tales of ancient Egypt have appeared  collectively only in French, in the charming volume of Maspero's \"Contes  Populaires\"; while some have been translated into English at scattered  times in volumes of the \"Records of the Past.\" But research moves  forward; and translations that were excellent twenty years ago may now  be largely improved, as we attain more insight into the language.    For another reason also there is a wide ground for the present volume.  In no case have any illustrations been attempted, to give that basis for  imagination which is all the more needed when reading of an age and a  land unfamiliar to our ideas. When following a narrative, whether of  real events or of fiction, many persons--perhaps most--find themselves  unconsciously framing in their minds the scenery and the beings of which  they are reading. To give a correct picture of the character of each of  the various ages to which these tales belong, has been the aim of the  present illustrations. A definite period has been assigned to each tale,  in accordance with the indications, or the history, involved in it; and,  so far as our present knowledge goes, all the details of life in the  scenes here illustrated are rendered in accord with the period of the  story.    To some purely scholastic minds it may seem presumptuous to  intermingle translations of notable documents with fanciful  illustrations. But, considering the greater precision with which in  recent years we have been able to learn the changes and the fashions  of ancient life in Egypt, and the essentially unhistorical nature of  most of these tales, there seems ample reason to provide such material  for the reader's imagination in following the stories; it may-give  them more life and reality, and may emphasise the differences which  existed between the different periods to which these tales refer.    It will be noticed how the growth of the novel is shadowed out in the  varied grounds and treatment of the tales. The earliest is purely a  collection of marvels or fabulous incidents of the simplest kind. Then  we advance to contrasts between town and country, between Egypt and  foreign lands. Then personal adventure, and the interest in schemes  and successes, becomes the staple material; while only in the later  periods does character come in as the groundwork. The same may be seen  in English literature--first the tales of wonders and strange lands,  then the novel of adventure, and lastly the novel of character.    In translating these documents into English I have freely used the  various translations already published in other languages; but in all  cases more or less revision and retranslation from the original has  been made. In this matter I am indebted to Mr. F. Ll. Griffith, who has  in some cases--as in Anpu and Bata--almost entirely retranslated the  original papyrus. The material followed in each instance will be found  stated in the notes accompanying the tales. As to the actual  phraseology, I am alone responsible for that. How far original idiom  should be retained in any translation is always a debated question, and  must entirely depend on the object in view. Here the purpose of  rendering the work intelligible to ordinary readers required the  modifying of some idioms and the paraphrasing of others. But so far  as possible the style and tone of the original has been preserved, and  whatever could be easily followed has been left to speak for itself. In  many plainnesses of speech the old Egyptian resembled the modern  Oriental, or our own forefathers, more than ourselves in this age of  squeamishness as yet unparalleled in the world. To avoid offence a few  little modifications of words have been made; but rather than give a  false impression by tampering with any of the narrative, I have omitted  the sequel of the last tale and given only an outline of it. The diction  adopted has been the oldest that could be used without affectation when  dealing with the early times. It has been purposely modified in the  later tales; and in the last--which is of Ptolemaic authorship--a  modern style has been followed as more compatible with the later tone of  the narrative.    For the illustrations Mr. Tristram Ellis's familiarity with Egypt has  been of good account in his life-like scenes here used. For each  drawing I have searched for the material among the monuments and  remains of the age in question. The details of the dresses, the  architecture, and the utensils, are all in accord with the period of  each tale. In the tale of Setnau two different styles are introduced.  Ahura is probably of the time of Amenhotep III., whereas Setnau is a  son of Ramessu II.; and the change of fashion between the two  different dynasties has been followed as distinctive of the two  persons, one a _ka_ or double of the deceased, the other a living man.  To the reader who starts with the current idea that all Egyptians were  alike, this continual change from one period to another may seem  almost fanciful. But it rests on such certain authority that we may  hope that this little volume may have its use as an object-lesson in  practical archaeology.    The use and abuse of notes is a matter of dispute. To be constantly  interrupted in reading by some needless and elementary explanation is  an impertinence both to the author and the reader: the one cannot  resent it, the other therefore resents it for both. But what is to be  deemed needless entirely depends on the reader: I have been asked in  what country Pompei is, as it is not in the English Gazetteer. Rather  than intrude, then, on the reader when he is in high discourse with  the ancients, I humbly set up my interpreter's booth next door; and if  he cares to call in, and ask about any difficulties, I shall be glad  to help him if I can. Not even numbers are intruded to refer to notes;  for how often an eager reader has been led off his trail, and turned  blithely to refer to 37 or 186 only to find, \"See J. Z. xxxviii.  377,\" at which he gnashed his teeth and cursed such interruptions. So  those to whom the original tales are obscure are humbly requested to  try for some profit from the remarks after them, that have been  gleaned by the translator.    Much might be said by a \"folk-lorist\"--in proportion to his ardour. But  as there are folk-lorists and folk-lorists, and the schools of Rabbi  Andrew and Rabbi Joseph write different targums, I have left each to  make his own commentary without prejudice.          TALES OF THE MAGICIANS      One day, when King Khufu reigned over all the land, he said to his  chancellor, who stood before him, \"Go call me my sons and my  councillors, that I may ask of them a thing.\" And his sons and his  councillors came and stood before him, and he said to them, \"Know ye a  man who can tell me tales of the deeds of the magicians?\"    Then the royal son Khafra stood forth and said, \"I will tell thy majesty  a tale of the days of thy forefather Nebka, the blessed; of what came to  pass when he went into the temple of Ptah of Ankhtaui.\"          KHAFRA'S TALE      \"His majesty was walking unto the temple of Ptah, and went unto the  house of the chief reciter Uba-aner, with his train. Now when the wife  of Uba-aner saw a page, among those who stood behind the king, her heart  longed after him; and she sent her servant unto him, with a present of a  box full of garments.    \"And he came then with the servant. Now there was a lodge in the garden  of Uba-aner; and one day the page said to the wife of Uba-aner, 'In the  garden of Uba-aner there is now a lodge; behold, let us therein take our  pleasure.' So the wife of Uba-aner sent to the steward who had charge  over the garden, saying, 'Let the lodge which is in the garden be made  ready.' And she remained there, and rested and drank with the page until  the sun went down.    \"And when the even was now come the page went forth to bathe. And the  steward said, 'I must go and tell Uba-aner of this matter.' Now when  this day was past, and another day came, then went the steward to  Uba-aner, and told him of all these things.    \"Then said Uba-aner, 'Bring me my casket of ebony and electrum.' And  they brought it; and he fashioned a crocodile of wax, seven fingers  long: and he enchanted it, and said, 'When the page comes and bathes in  my lake, seize on him.' And he gave it to the steward, and said to him,  'When the page shall go down into the lake to bathe, as he is daily wont  to do, then throw in this crocodile behind him.' And the steward went  forth bearing the crocodile.    \"And the wife of Uba-aner sent to the steward who had charge over the  garden, saying, 'Let the lodge which is in the garden be made ready, for  I come to tarry there.'    \"And the lodge was prepared with all good things; and she came and made  merry therein with the page. And when the even was now come, the page  went forth to bathe as he was wont to do.

H. HUDSON          PREFACE    _Romances of the future, however fantastic they may be, have for most  of us a perennial if mild interest, since they are born of a very common  feeling--a sense of dissatisfaction with the existing order of things,  combined with a vague faith in or hope of a better one to come. The  picture put before us is false; we knew it would be false before looking  at it, since we cannot imagine what is unknown any more than we can  build without materials. Our mental atmosphere surrounds and shuts us in  like our own skins; no one can boast that he has broken out of that  prison. The vast, unbounded prospect lies before us, but, as the poet  mournfully adds, \"clouds and darkness rest upon it.\" Nevertheless we  cannot suppress all curiosity, or help asking one another, What is your  dream--your ideal? What is your News from Nowhere, or, rather, what is  the result of the little shake your hand has given to the old pasteboard  toy with a dozen bits of colored glass for contents? And, most important  of all, can you present it in a narrative or romance which will enable  me to pass an idle hour not disagreeably? How, for instance, does it  compare in this respect with other prophetic books on the shelf?_    _I am not referring to living authors; least of all to that flamingo of  letters who for the last decade or so has been a wonder to our island  birds. For what could I say of him that is not known to every one--that  he is the tallest of fowls, land or water, of a most singular shape, and  has black-tipped crimson wings folded under his delicate rose-colored  plumage? These other books referred to, written, let us say, from thirty  or forty years to a century or two ago, amuse us in a way their poor  dead authors never intended. Most amusing are the dead ones who take  themselves seriously, whose books are pulpits quaintly carved and  decorated with precious stones and silken canopies in which they stand  and preach to or at their contemporaries._    _In like manner, in going through this book of mine after so many years I  am amused at the way it is colored by the little cults and crazes, and  modes of thought of the 'eighties of the last century. They were so  important then, and now, if remembered at all, they appear so trivial!  It pleases me to be diverted in this way at \"A Crystal Age\"--to find, in  fact, that I have not stood still while the world has been moving._    _This criticism refers to the case, the habit, of the book rather than  to its spirit, since when we write we do, as the red man thought, impart  something of our souls to the paper, and it is probable that if I were  to write a new dream of the future it would, though in some respects  very different from this, still be a dream and picture of the human race  in its forest period._    _Alas that in this case the wish cannot induce belief! For now I remember  another thing which Nature said--that earthly excellence can come in no  way but one, and the ending of passion and strife is the beginning of  decay. It is indeed a hard saying, and the hardest lesson we can learn  of her without losing love and bidding good-by forever to hope._    W. H. H.              A CRYSTAL AGE      Chapter 1    I do not quite know how it happened, my recollection of the whole matter  ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition. I fancy I had gone somewhere on  a botanizing expedition, but whether at home or abroad I don't know. At  all events, I remember that I had taken up the study of plants with a  good deal of enthusiasm, and that while hunting for some variety in the  mountains I sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine. Perhaps it was on  the ledge of an overhanging rock; anyhow, if I remember rightly, the  ground gave way all about me, precipitating me below. The fall was a  very considerable one--probably thirty or forty feet, or more, and I was  rendered unconscious. How long I lay there under the heap of earth and  stones carried down in my fall it is impossible to say: perhaps a long  time; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the  _debris_, like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel  the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs. I found myself standing (oddly  enough, on all fours) in an immense pit created by the overthrow of a  gigantic dead tree with a girth of about thirty or forty feet. The tree  itself had rolled down to the bottom of the ravine; but the pit in which  it had left the huge stumps of severed roots was, I found, situated in a  gentle slope at the top of the bank! How, then, I could have fallen  seemingly so far from no height at all, puzzled me greatly: it looked as  if the solid earth had been indulging in some curious transformation  pranks during those moments or minutes of insensibility. Another  singular circumstance was that I had a great mass of small fibrous  rootlets tightly woven about my whole person, so that I was like a  colossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered  with wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had _grown_ round me!  Luckily they were quite sapless and brittle, and without bothering my  brains too much about the matter, I set to work to rid myself of them.  After stripping the woody covering off, I found that my tourist suit of  rough Scotch homespun had not suffered much harm, although the cloth  exuded a damp, moldy smell; also that my thick-soled climbing boots had  assumed a cracked rusty appearance as if I had been engaged in some  brick-field operations; while my felt hat was in such a discolored and  battered condition that I felt almost ashamed to put it on my head. My  watch was gone; perhaps I had not been wearing it, but my pocket-book in  which I had my money was safe in my breast pocket.    Glad and grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a  dangerous accident, I set out walking along the edge of the ravine,  which soon broadened to a valley running between two steep hills; and  then, seeing water at the bottom and feeling very dry, I ran down the  slope to get a drink. Lying flat on my chest to slake my thirst animal  fashion, I was amazed at the reflection the water gave back of my face:  it was, skin and hair, thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets! Having  taken a long drink, I threw off my clothes to have a bath; and after  splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its  accumulations of dirt. While drying in the wind I shook the loose sand  and clay from my garments, then dressed, and, feeling greatly refreshed,  proceeded on my walk.    For an hour or so I followed the valley in its many windings, but,  failing to see any dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of  the surrounding country. The prospect which disclosed itself when I had  got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level, appeared  unfamiliar. The hills among which I had been wandering were now behind  me; before me spread a wide rolling country, beyond which rose a  mountain range resembling in the distance blue banked-up clouds with  summits and peaks of pearly whiteness. Looking on this scene I could  hardly refrain from shouting with joy, so glad did the sunlit expanse of  earth, and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze, make me feel. The  season was late summer--that was plain to see; the ground was moist, as  if from recent showers, and the earth everywhere had that intense living  greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are  over; but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched  here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay. A more tranquil  and soul-satisfying scene could not be imagined: the dear old mother  earth was looking her very best; while the shifting golden sunlight, the  mysterious haze in the distance, and the glint of a wide stream not very  far off, seemed to spiritualize her \"happy autumn fields,\" and bring  them into a closer kinship with the blue over-arching sky. There was one  large house or mansion in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not  one solitary spire. In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently  to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine. This  troubled me not a little, for I had no idea that I had drifted so far  from civilization in my search for specimens, or whatever it was that  brought me to this pretty, primitive wilderness. Not quite a wilderness,  however, for there, within a short hour's walk of the hill, stood the  one great stone mansion, close to the river I had mentioned. There were  also horses and cows in sight, and a number of scattered sheep were  grazing on the hillside beneath me.    Strange to relate, I met with a little misadventure on account of the  sheep--an animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and  inoffensive nature. When I set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house  I have spoken of, in order to make some inquiries there, a few of the  sheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly, as if alarmed, and  by and by they came hurrying after me, apparently in a great state of  excitement. I did not mind them much, but presently a pair of horses,  attracted by their bleatings, also seemed struck at my appearance, and  came at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me. They were  magnificent-looking brutes, evidently a pair of well-groomed carriage  horses, for their coats, which were of a fine bronze color, sparkled  wonderfully in the sunshine. In other respects they were very unlike  carriage animals, for they had tails reaching to the ground, like  funeral horses, and immense black leonine manes, which gave them a  strikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance. For some moments  they stood with heads erect, gazing fixedly at me, and then  simultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment, so loud  and sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun. This tremendous  equine blast brought "]]]
