M. FLINDERS PETRIE,    HON. D.C.L., LL.D.    EDWARDS PROFESSOR OF EGYPTOLOGY, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON    ILLUSTRATED BY TRISTRAM ELLIS    SECOND EDITION      _First Published . . . September 1895  Second Edition . . . February 1913_          PREFACE      As the scope of the first series of these Tales seems to have been  somewhat overlooked, a few words of introduction may not be out of place  before this second volume.    It seems that any simple form of fiction is supposed to be a \"fairy  tale:\" which implies that it has to do with an impossible world of  imaginary beings. Now the Egyptian Tales are exactly the opposite of  this, they relate the doings and the thoughts of men and women who are  human--sometimes \"very human,\" as Mr. Balfour said. Whatever there is of  supernatural elements is a very part of the beliefs and motives of the  people whose lives are here pictured. But most of what is here might  happen in some corner of our own country to-day, where ancient beliefs  may have a home. So far, then, from being fairy tales there is not a  single being that could be termed a fairy in the whole of them.    Another notion that seems to be about is that the only possible object  of reading any form of fiction is for pure amusement, to fill an idle  hour and be forgotten and if these tales are not as amusing as some  jester of to-day, then the idler says, Away with them as a failure! For  such a person, who only looks to have the tedium of a vacuous mind  relieved, these tales are not in the least intended. But the real and  genuine charm of all fiction is that of enabling the reader to place  himself in the mental position of, another, to see with the eyes, to  feel with the thoughts, to reason with the mind, of a wholly different  being. All the greatest work has this charm. It may be to place the reader  in new mental positions, or in a different level of the society that he  already knows, either higher or lower; or it may be to make alive to him  a society of a different land or age. Whether he read \"Treasure Island\"  or \"Plain Tales from the Hills,\" \"The Scarlet Letter,\" \"Old Mortality,\"  or \"Hypatia,\" it is the transplanting of the reader into a new life, the  doubling of his mental experience, that is the very power of fiction.  The same interest attaches to these tales. In place of regarding  Egyptians only as the builders of pyramids and the makers of mummies, we  here see the men and women as they lived, their passions, their foibles,  their beliefs, and their follies. The old refugee Sanehat craving to be  buried with his ancestors in the blessed land, the enterprise and  success of the Doomed Prince, the sweetness of Bata, the misfortunes of  Ahura, these all live before us, and we can for a brief half hour share  the feelings and see with the eyes of those who ruled the world when it  was young. This is the real value of these tales, and the power which  still belongs to the oldest literature in the world.    Erratum in First Edition, 1st Series.

CONTENTS      THE TAKING OF JOPPA    REMARKS    THE DOOMED PRINCE    REMARKS    ANPU AND BATA    REMARKS    SETNA AND THE MAGIC BOOK    REMARKS    INDEX            XVIIITH DYNASTY    THE TAKING OF JOPPA      There was once in the time of King Men-kheper-ra a revolt of the  servants of his majesty who were in Joppa; and his majesty said, \"Let  Tahutia go with his footmen and destroy this wicked Foe in Joppa.\" And  he called one of his followers, and said moreover, \"Hide thou my great  cane, which works wonders, in the baggage of Tahutia that my power may  go with him.\"    Now when Tahutia came near to Joppa, with all the footmen of Pharaoh, he  sent unto the Foe in Joppa, and said, \"Behold now his majesty, King  Men-kheper-ra, has sent all this great army against thee; but what is  that if my heart is as thy heart? Do thou come, and let us talk in the  field, and see each other face to face.\" So Tahutia came with certain of  his men; and the Foe in Joppa came likewise, but his charioteer that was  with him was true of heart unto the king of Egypt. And they spoke with  one another in his great tent, which Tahutia had placed far off from the  soldiers. But Tahutia had made ready two hundred sacks, with cords and  fetters, and had made a great sack of skins with bronze fetters, and  many baskets: and they were in his tent, the sacks and the baskets, and  he had placed them as the forage for the horses is put in baskets. For  whilst the Foe in Joppa drank with Tahutia, the people who were with him  drank with the footmen of Pharaoh, and made merry with them. And when  their bout of drinking was past, Tahutia said to the Foe in Joppa, \"If  it please thee, while I remain with the women and children of thy own  city, let one bring of my people with their horses, that they may give  them provender, or let one of the Apuro run to fetch them.\" So they  came, and hobbled their horses, and gave them provender, and one found  the great cane of Men-kheper-ra (Tahutmes III.), and came to tell of it  to Tahutia. And thereupon the Foe in Joppa said to Tahutia, \"My heart is  set on examining the great cane of Men-kheper-ra, which is named '. . .  tautnefer.' By the _ka_ of the King Men-kheper-ra it will be in thy  hands to-day; now do thou well and bring thou it to me.\" And Tahutia did  thus, and he brought the cane of King Men-kheper-ra. And he laid hold on  the Foe in Joppa by his garment, and he arose and stood up, and said,  \"Look on me, O Foe in Joppa; here is the great cane of King  Men-kheper-ra, the terrible lion, the son of Sekhet, to whom Amen his  father gives power and strength.\" And he raised his hand and struck the  forehead of the Foe in Joppa, and he fell helpless before him. He put  him in the sack of skins and he bound with gyves the hands of the Foe in  Joppa, and put on his feet the fetters with four rings. And he made them  bring the two hundred sacks which he had cleaned, and made to enter into  them two hundred soldiers, and filled the hollows with cords and fetters  of wood, he sealed them with a seal, and added to them their rope-nets  and the poles to bear them. And he put every strong footman to bear  them, in all six hundred men, and said to them, \"When you come  into the town you shall open your burdens, you shall seize on all the  inhabitants of the town, and you shall quickly put fetters upon them.\"    Then one went out and said unto the charioteer of the Foe in Joppa, \"Thy  master is fallen; go, say to thy mistress, 'A pleasant message! For  Sutekh has given Tahutia to us, with his wife and his children; behold  the beginning of their tribute,' that she may comprehend the two hundred  sacks, which are full of men and cords and fetters.\" So he went before  them to please the heart of his mistress, saying, \"We have laid hands on  Tahutia.\" Then the gates of the city were opened before the footmen:  they entered the city, they opened their burdens, they laid hands on  them of the city, both small and great, they put on them the cords and  fetters quickly; the power of Pharaoh seized upon that city. After he  had rested Tahutia sent a message to Egypt to the King Men-kheper-ra his  lord, saying, \"Be pleased, for Amen thy good father has given to thee  the Foe in Joppa, together with all his people, likewise also his city.  Send, therefore, people to take them as captives that thou mayest fill  the house of thy father Amen Ra, king of the gods, with men-servants and  maid-servants, and that they may be overthrown beneath thy feet for ever  and ever.\"          REMARKS      This tale of the taking of Joppa appears to be probably on an historical  basis. Tahutia was a well-known officer of Tahutmes III.; and the  splendid embossed dish of weighty gold which the king presented to him  is one of the principal treasures of the Louvre museum. It is ornamented  with groups of fish in the flat bottom, and a long inscription around  the side.    Unfortunately the earlier part of this tale has been lost; but in order  to render it intelligible I have restored an opening to it, without  introducing any details but what are alluded to, or necessitated, by the  existing story. The original text begins at the star.    It is evident that the basis of the tale is the stratagem of the  Egyptian general, offering to make friends with the rebel of Joppa,  while he sought to trap him. To a Western soldier such an unblushing  offer of being treacherous to his master the king would be enough to  make the good faith of his proposals to the enemy very doubtful. But in  the East offers of wholesale desertion are not rare. In Greek history it  was quite an open question whether Athens or Persia would retain a  general's service; in Byzantine history a commander might be in favour  with the Khalif one year and with the Autokrator the next; and in the  present century the entire transfer of the Turkish fleet to Mohammed Ali  in 1840 is a grand instance of such a case.    The scheme of taking a fortress by means of smuggling in soldiers hidden  in packages has often recurred in history; but this taking of Joppa is  the oldest tale of the kind yet known. Following this we have the wooden  horse of Troy. Then comes in mediaeval times the Arab scheme for taking  Edessa, in 1038 A.D., by a train of five hundred camels bearing presents  for the Autokrator at Constantinople. The governor of Edessa declined to  admit such travellers, and a bystander, hearing some talking in the  baskets slung on the camels, soon gave the alarm, which led to the  destruction of the whole party; the chief alone, less hands, ears, and  nose, being left to take the tale back to Bagdad. And in fiction there  are the stories of a lady avenging her husband by introducing men hidden  in skins, and the best known version of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

The cricket season  had not begun, and except during the cricket season they were in the  habit of devoting their powerful minds at breakfast almost exclusively  to the task of victualling against the labours of the day. In May,  June, July, and August the silence was broken. The three grown-up  Jacksons played regularly in first-class cricket, and there was always  keen competition among their brothers and sisters for the copy of the  _Sportsman_ which was to be found on the hall table with the  letters. Whoever got it usually gloated over it in silence till urged  wrathfully by the multitude to let them know what had happened; when  it would appear that Joe had notched his seventh century, or that  Reggie had been run out when he was just getting set, or, as sometimes  occurred, that that ass Frank had dropped Fry or Hayward in the slips  before he had scored, with the result that the spared expert had made  a couple of hundred and was still going strong.    In such a case the criticisms of the family circle, particularly of  the smaller Jackson sisters, were so breezy and unrestrained that Mrs.  Jackson generally felt it necessary to apply the closure. Indeed,  Marjory Jackson, aged fourteen, had on three several occasions been  fined pudding at lunch for her caustic comments on the batting of her  brother Reggie in important fixtures. Cricket was a tradition in the  family, and the ladies, unable to their sorrow to play the game  themselves, were resolved that it should not be their fault if the  standard was not kept up.    On this particular morning silence reigned. A deep gasp from some  small Jackson, wrestling with bread-and-milk, and an occasional remark  from Mr. Jackson on the letters he was reading, alone broke it.    \"Mike's late again,\" said Mrs. Jackson plaintively, at last.    \"He's getting up,\" said Marjory. \"I went in to see what he was doing,  and he was asleep. So,\" she added with a satanic chuckle, \"I squeezed  a sponge over him. He swallowed an awful lot, and then he woke up, and  tried to catch me, so he's certain to be down soon.\"    \"Marjory!\"    \"Well, he was on his back with his mouth wide open. I had to. He was  snoring like anything.\"    \"You might have choked him.\"    \"I did,\" said Marjory with satisfaction. \"Jam, please, Phyllis, you  pig.\"    Mr. Jackson looked up.    \"Mike will have to be more punctual when he goes to Wrykyn,\" he said.    \"Oh, father, is Mike going to Wrykyn?\" asked Marjory. \"When?\"    \"Next term,\" said Mr. Jackson. \"I've just heard from Mr. Wain,\" he  added across the table to Mrs. Jackson. \"The house is full, but he is  turning a small room into an extra dormitory, so he can take Mike  after all.\"    The first comment on this momentous piece of news came from Bob  Jackson. Bob was eighteen. The following term would be his last at  Wrykyn, and, having won through so far without the infliction of a  small brother, he disliked the prospect of not being allowed to finish  as he had begun.    \"I say!\" he said. \"What?\"    \"He ought to have gone before,\" said Mr. Jackson. \"He's fifteen. Much  too old for that private school. He has had it all his own way there,  and it isn't good for him.\"    \"He's got cheek enough for ten,\" agreed Bob.    \"Wrykyn will do him a world of good.\"    \"We aren't in the same house. That's one comfort.\"    Bob was in Donaldson's. It softened the blow to a certain extent that  Mike should be going to Wain's. He had the same feeling for Mike that  most boys of eighteen have for their fifteen-year-old brothers. He was  fond of him in the abstract, but preferred him at a distance.    Marjory gave tongue again. She had rescued the jam from Phyllis, who  had shown signs of finishing it, and was now at liberty to turn her  mind to less pressing matters. Mike was her special ally, and anything  that affected his fortunes affected her.    \"Hooray! Mike's going to Wrykyn. I bet he gets into the first eleven  his first term.\"    \"Considering there are eight old colours left,\" said Bob loftily,  \"besides heaps of last year's seconds, it's hardly likely that a kid  like Mike'll get a look in. He might get his third, if he sweats.\"    The aspersion stung Marjory.    \"I bet he gets in before you, anyway,\" she said.    Bob disdained to reply. He was among those heaps of last year's  seconds to whom he had referred. He was a sound bat, though lacking  the brilliance of his elder brothers, and he fancied that his cap was  a certainty this season. Last year he had been tried once or twice.  This year it should be all right.    Mrs. Jackson intervened.    \"Go on with your breakfast, Marjory,\" she said. \"You mustn't say 'I  bet' so much.\"    Marjory bit off a section of her slice of bread-and-jam.    \"Anyhow, I bet he does,\" she muttered truculently through it.    There was a sound of footsteps in the passage outside. The door  opened, and the missing member of the family appeared. Mike Jackson  was tall for his age. His figure was thin and wiry. His arms and legs  looked a shade too long for his body. He was evidently going to be  very tall some day. In face, he was curiously like his brother Joe,  whose appearance is familiar to every one who takes an interest in  first-class cricket. The resemblance was even more marked on the  cricket field. Mike had Joe's batting style to the last detail. He was  a pocket edition of his century-making brother. \"Hullo,\" he said,  \"sorry I'm late.\"    This was mere stereo. He had made the same remark nearly every morning  since the beginning of the holidays.    \"All right, Marjory, you little beast,\" was his reference to the  sponge incident.    His third remark was of a practical nature.    \"I say, what's under that dish?\"    \"Mike,\" began Mr. Jackson--this again was stereo--\"you really must  learn to be more punctual----\"    He was interrupted by a chorus.    \"Mike, you're going to Wrykyn next term,\" shouted Marjory.    \"Mike, father's just had a letter to say you're going to Wrykyn next  term.\" From Phyllis.    \"Mike, you're going to Wrykyn.\" From Ella.    Gladys Maud Evangeline, aged three, obliged with a solo of her own  composition, in six-eight time, as follows: \"Mike Wryky. Mike Wryky.  Mike Wryke Wryke Wryke Mike Wryke Wryke Mike Wryke Mike Wryke.\"    \"Oh, put a green baize cloth over that kid, somebody,\" groaned Bob.    Whereat Gladys Maud, having fixed him with a chilly stare for some  seconds, suddenly drew a long breath, and squealed deafeningly for  more milk.    Mike looked round the table. It was a great moment. He rose to it with  the utmost dignity.    \"Good,\" he said. \"I say, what's under that dish?\"           *       *       *       *       *    After breakfast, Mike and Marjory went off together to the meadow at  the end of the garden.
