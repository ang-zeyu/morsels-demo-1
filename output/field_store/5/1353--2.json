He  came of a family of wealthy merchants of Bordeaux, and was educated  at the College de Guyenne, where he had among his teachers the great  Scottish Latinist, George Buchanan. Later he studied law, and held  various public offices; but at the age of thirty-eight he retired to  his estates, where he lived apart from the civil wars of the time,  and devoted himself to study and thought. While he was traveling in  Germany and Italy, in 1580-81, he was elected mayor of Bordeaux, and  this office he filled for four years. He married in 1565, and had  six daughters, only one of whom grew up. The first two books of his  \"Essays\" appeared in 1580; the third in 1588; and four years later  he died.    These are the main external facts of Montaigne's life: of the man  himself the portrait is to be found in his book. \"It is myself I  portray,\" he declares; and there is nowhere in literature a volume  of self-revelation surpassing his in charm and candor. He is frankly  egotistical, yet modest and unpretentious; profoundly wise, yet  constantly protesting his ignorance; learned, yet careless,  forgetful, and inconsistent. His themes are as wide and varied as  his observation of human life, and he has written the finest eulogy  of friendship the world has known. Bacon, who knew his book and  borrowed from it, wrote on the same subject; and the contrast of the  essays is the true reflection of the contrast between the  personalities of their authors.    Shortly after Montaigne's death the \"Essays\" were translated into  English by John Florio, with less than exact accuracy, but in a  style so full of the flavor of the age that we still read Montaigne  in the version which Shakespeare knew. The group of examples here  printed exhibits the author in a variety of moods, easy, serious,  and, in the essay on \"Friendship,\" as nearly impassioned as his  philosophy ever allowed him to become.    Reader, be here a well-meaning Booke. It doth at the firth entrance  forewarne thee, that in contriving the same I have proposed unto my  selfe no other than a familiar and private end: I have no respect or  consideration at all, either to thy service, or to my glory: my  forces are not capable of any such desseigne. I have vowed the same  to the particular commodity of my kinsfolks and friends: to the end,  that losing me (which they are likely to doe ere long), they may  therein find some lineaments of my conditions and humours, and by  that meanes reserve more whole, and more lively foster the knowledge  and acquaintance they have had of me. Had my intention beene to  forestal and purchase the world's opinion and favour, I would surely  have adorned myselfe more quaintly, or kept a more grave and solemne  march. I desire therein to be delineated in mine owne genuine,  simple and ordinarie fashion, without contention, art or study; for  it is myself e I pourtray. My imperfections shall therein be read to  the life, and my naturall forme discerned, so farre-forth as publike  reverence hath permitted me. For if my fortune had beene to have  lived among those nations which yet are said to live under the sweet  liberty of Nature's first and uncorrupted lawes, I assure thee, I  would most willingly have pourtrayed my selfe fully and naked. Thus,  gentle Reader, myself I am the groundworke of my booke: it is then  no reason thou shouldest employ thy time about so frivolous and  vaine a subject.    Therefore farewell.    From MONTAIGNE,    The First of March, 1580.          THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE OF OUR HAPPINESSE UNTILL AFTER OUR DEATH         scilicet ultima semper       Expectanda dies homini est, dicique beatus       Ante obitum nemo, supremaque funera debat.       [Footnote: Ovid. Met. 1, iii. 135.]         We must expect of man the latest day,       Nor ere he die, he's happie, can we say.    The very children are acquainted with the storie of Croesus to this  purpose: who being taken by Cyrus, and by him condemned to die, upon  the point of his execution, cried out aloud: \"Oh Solon, Solon!\"  which words of his, being reported to Cyrus, who inquiring what he  meant by them, told him, hee now at his owne cost verified the  advertisement Solon had before times given him; which was, that no  man, what cheerefull and blandishing countenance soever fortune  shewed them, may rightly deeme himselfe happie, till such time as he  have passed the last day of his life, by reason of the uncertaintie  and vicissitude of humane things, which by a very light motive, and  slight occasion, are often changed from one to another cleane  contrary state and degree. And therefore Agesilaus answered one that  counted the King of Persia happy, because being very young, he had  gotten the garland of so mightie and great a dominion: \"yea but said  he, Priam at the same age was not unhappy.\" Of the Kings of Macedon  that succeeded Alexander the Great, some were afterward seene to  become Joyners and Scriveners at Rome: and of Tyrants of Sicilie,  Schoolemasters at Corinth. One that had conquered halfe the world,  and been Emperour over so many, Armies, became an humble and  miserable suter to the raskally officers of a king of AEgypte: At so  high a rate did that great Pompey purchase the irkesome prolonging  of his life but for five or six moneths. And in our fathers daies,  Lodowicke Sforze, tenth Duke of Millane, under whom the State of  Italic had so long beene turmoiled and shaken, was seene to die a  wretched prisoner at Loches in France, but not till he had lived and  lingered ten yeares in thraldom, which was the worst of his  bargaine. The fairest Queene, wife to the greatest King of  Christendome, was she not lately scene to die by the hands of an  executioner? Oh unworthie and barbarous cruelties And a thousand  such examples. For, it seemeth that as the sea-billowes and surging  waves, rage and storme against the surly pride and stubborne height  of our buildings, so are there above, certaine spirits that envie  the rising prosperities and greatnesse heere below.         Vsque adeb res humanas vis abdita quadam       Obterit, et pulchros fasces sav&sque secures       Proculcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere videtur.       [Footnote: LUCRET. I. v. 1243.]         A hidden power so mens states hath out-worne       Faire swords, fierce scepters, signes of honours borne,       It seemes to trample and deride in scorne.    And it seemeth Fortune doth sometimes narrowly watch the last day of  our life, thereby to shew her power, and in one moment to overthrow  what for many yeares together she had been erecting, and makes us  cry after Laberius, Nimirum hoc die una plus vixi, mihi quam  vivendum fuit. [Footnote: MACHOB, 1, ii. 7.] Thus it is, \"I have  lived longer by this one day than I should.\" So may that good advice  of Solon be taken with reason. But forsomuch as he is a Philosopher,  with whom the favours or disfavours of fortune, and good or ill  lucke have no place, and are not regarded by him; and puissances and  greatnesses, and accidents of qualitie, are well-nigh indifferent: I  deeme it very likely he had a further reach, and meant that the same  good fortune of our life, which dependeth of the tranquillitie and  contentment of a welborne minde, and of the resolution and assurance  of a well ordered soule, should never be ascribed unto man, untill  he have beene scene play the last act of his comedie, and without  doubt the hardest. In all the rest there may be some maske: either  these sophisticall discourses of Philosophie are not in us but by  countenance, or accidents that never touch us to the quick, give us  alwaies leasure to keep our countenance setled. But when that last  part of death, and of our selves comes to be acted, then no  dissembling will availe, then is it high time to speake plaine  English, and put off all vizards: then whatsoever the pot containeth  must be shewne, be it good or bad, foule or cleane, wine or water.          Nam vera voces tum demum pectore ab imo        Ejiciuntur, et eripitur persona, manet res.       [Footnote: LUCEET. 1. iii. 57.]         For then are sent true speeches from the heart,       We are ourselves, we leave to play a part.    Loe heere, why at this last cast, all our lives other actions must  be tride and touched. It is the master-day, the day that judgeth all  others: it is the day, saith an auncient Writer, that must judge of  all my forepassed yeares. To death doe I referre the essay  [Footnote: Assay, exact weighing.] of my studies fruit. There shall  wee see whether my discourse proceed from my heart, or from my  mouth. I have scene divers, by their death, either in good or evill,  give reputation to all their forepassed life. Scipio, father-in-law  to Pompey, in well dying, repaired the ill opinion which untill that  houre men had ever held of him. Epaminondas being demanded which of  the three he esteemed most, either Chabrias, or Iphicrates, or  himselfe: \"It is necessary,\" said he, \"that we be scene to die,  before your question may well be resolved."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],[0,"The Lectures on Faith (#1)"],[1,"Lectures on Faith        LECTURE FIRST    On the Doctrine of the Church of the    Latter Day Saints.    Of Faith.    Section 1.    1. Faith being the first principle in revealed religion, and the  foundation of all righteousness, necessarily claims the first place in  a course of lectures which are designed to unfold to the understanding  the doctrine of Jesus Christ.    2. In presenting the subject of faith, we shall observe the following  order--    3. first, faith itself--what it is.    4. Secondly, the object on which it rests. And,    5. Thirdly, the effects which flow from it.    6. Agreeable to this order we have first to show what faith is.    7. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter  of that epistle and first verse, gives the following definition of the  word faith:    8. Now faith is the substance (assurance) of things hoped for, the  evidence of things not seen.    9. From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of  the existence of things which they have not seen, and the principle of  action in all intelligent beings.    10. If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts  and reflections to the operations of their own minds, they would  readily discover that it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving  cause of all action in them; that without it both mind and body would  be in a state of inactivity, and all their exertions would cease, both  physical and mental.    11. Were this class to go back and reflect upon the history of their  lives, from the period of their first recollection, and ask themselves  what principle excited them to action, or what gave them energy and  activity in all their lawful avocations, callings, and pursuits, what  would be the answer?--Would it not be that it was the assurance which  they had of the existence of things which they had not seen as yet? Was  it not the hope which you had, in consequence of your belief in the  existence of unseen things, which stimulated you to action and exertion  in order to obtain them? Are you not dependent on your faith, or  belief, for the acquisition of all knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence?  Would you exert yourselves to obtain wisdom and intelligence, unless  you did believe that you could obtain them? Would you have ever sown,  if you had not believed that you would reap? Would you have ever  planted, if you had not believed that you would gather? Would you have  ever asked, unless you had believed that you would receive? Would you  have ever sought, unless you had believed that you would have found?  Or, would you have ever knocked, unless you had believed that it would  have been opened unto you? In a word, is there anything that you  would have done, either physical or mental, if you had not previously  believed? Are not all your exertions, of every kind, dependent on your  faith? Or, may we not ask, what have you, or what do you possess, which  you have not obtained by reason of your faith? Your food, your raiment,  your lodgings, are they not all by reason of your faith? Reflect, and  ask yourselves if these things are not so. Turn your thoughts on your  own minds, and see if faith is not the moving cause of all action in  yourselves; and, if the moving cause in you, is it not in all other  intelligent beings?    12. And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal  concerns, so it is in spiritual; for the Savior has said, and that  truly, that he that _believeth_ and is baptized, shall be saved. Mark  16:16.    13. As we receive by faith, all temporal blessings that we do receive,  so we, in like manner, receive by faith all spiritual blessings, that  we do receive. But faith is not only the principle of action, but of  power also, in all intelligent beings whether in heaven or on earth.  Thus says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, 11:3:    14. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word  of God: so that things which are seen were not made of things which do  appear.    15. By this we understand that the principle of power, which existed in  the bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith; and that  it is by reason of this principle of power existing in the Deity, that  all created things exist--so that all things in heaven, on earth, or  under the earth, exist by reason of faith as it existed in HIM.    16. Had it not been for the principle of faith the worlds would never  have been framed, neither would man have been formed of the dust--It is  the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises  power over all temporal as well as eternal things. Take this principle  or attribute, (for it is an attribute) from the Deity and he would  cease to exist.    17. Who cannot see, that if God framed the worlds by faith, that it  is by faith that he exercises power over them, and that faith is the  principle of power? And if the principle of power, it must be so in  man as well as in the Deity? This is the testimony of all the sacred  writers, and the lesson which they have been endeavouring to teach to  man.    18. The Saviour says Matthew 17:19,20, in explaining the reason why  the disciples could not cast out the devil, that it was because of  their unbelief: For verily I say unto you, said he, if ye have faith  as a grain of mustard--seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove  hence to you yonder place! and it shall remove: and nothing shall be  impossible unto you.    19. Moroni, while abridging and compiling the record of his fathers,  has given us the following account of faith as the principle of power:  He says, page 563, that it was the faith of Alma and Amulek which  caused the walls of the prison to be rent, as recorded on the 264th  page; that it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi which caused a change to  be wrought upon the hearts of the Lamanites, when they were immersed  with the Holy Spirit, and with fire, as seen on the 421st page; and  that it was by faith that the mountain Zerin was removed, when the  brother of Jared spake in the name of the Lord. See also 565th page.    20. In addition to this we are told in Hebrews 11:32,33,34,35, that  Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,  through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained  promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire,  escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed  valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens, and that  women received their dead raised to life again, &c., &c.    21. Also, Joshua, in the sight of all Israel, bade the sun and moon to  stand still, and it was done. Josh. 10:12.    22. We here understand, that the sacred writers say, that all these  things were done by faith--It was by faith that the worlds were  framed--God spake, chaos heard, and worlds came into order, by reason  of the faith there was in HIM. So with man also--he spake by faith in  the name of God, and the sun stood still, the moon obeyed, mountains  removed, prisons fell, lions' mouths were closed, the human heart  lost its enmity, fire its violence, armies their power, the sword its  terror, and death its dominion; and all this by reason of the faith  which was in him.    23. Had it not been for the faith which was in men, they might have  spoken to the sun, the moon, the mountains, prisons, the human heart,  fire, armies, the sword, or to death in vain!    24. Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has  power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by  it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain,  agreeably to the will of God. Without it, there is no power, and  without power there could be no creation, nor existence!    OF THEOLOGY    _Question_.--What is theology?    _Answer_.--It is that revealed science which treats of the being and  attributes of God--his relations to us--the dispensations of his  providence--his will With respect to our actions--and his purposes with  respect to our end. [Buck's Theological Dictionary, page 582].    Q. What is the first principle in this revealed science?    A. Faith. [§ I. ¶ 1.]    Q. Why is faith the first principle in this revealed science?    A. Because it is the foundation of all righteousness. Heb 11:6. without  faith it is impossible to please God. 1st John, 3:7 Little children,  let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness, is righteous, even  as he [God] is righteous. [§ I. ¶ 1.]    Q. What arrangement should be followed in presenting the subject of  faith?    A. First, it should be shown what faith is. [§ I. ¶ 3.] Secondly, the  object upon which it rests. [§ I. ¶ 4.]    And, thirdly, the effects which flow from it. [§ I. ¶ 5.]    Q. What is faith?    A. It is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things  not seen (Heb 11:1); that is, it is the assurance we have of the  existence of unseen things. And being the assurance which we have of  the existence of unseen things, must be the principle of action in all  intelligent beings. Heb. 11:3 Through faith we understand the worlds  were framed by the word of God. [§ I. ¶ 8,9.]    Q. How do you prove that faith is the principle of action in all  intelligent beings?    A. First, by duly considering the operations of my own mind; and,  secondly, by the direct declaration of Scripture--Heb. 11:7 By faith  Noah, being warned of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared  an ark to the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world,  and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. Heb. 11:8. By  faith Abraham, when he was called to go into a place which he should  afterwards receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out not  knowing whither he went. Heb. 11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land of  promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac  and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. Heb 11:27"]]]
