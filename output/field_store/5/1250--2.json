Mrs. McFarland was attending the weekly card party held by the  Women's Anti-Gambling League. Sister Nell's young man had called  quite unexpectedly to take her for a long drive. Papa was at the  office, as usual. It was Mary Ann's day out. As for Emeline, she  certainly should have stayed in the house and looked after the  little girl; but Emeline had a restless nature.    \"Would you mind, miss, if I just crossed the alley to speak a word  to Mrs. Carleton's girl?\" she asked Martha.    \"'Course not,\" replied the child. \"You'd better lock the back door,  though, and take the key, for I shall be upstairs.\"    \"Oh, I'll do that, of course, miss,\" said the delighted maid, and  ran away to spend the afternoon with her friend, leaving Martha  quite alone in the big house, and locked in, into the bargain.    The little girl read a few pages in her new book, sewed a few  stitches in her embroidery and started to \"play visiting\" with her  four favorite dolls. Then she remembered that in the attic was a  doll's playhouse that hadn't been used for months, so she decided  she would dust it and put it in order.    Filled with this idea, the girl climbed the winding stairs to the  big room under the roof. It was well lighted by three dormer windows  and was warm and pleasant. Around the walls were rows of boxes and  trunks, piles of old carpeting, pieces of damaged furniture, bundles  of discarded clothing and other odds and ends of more or less value.  Every well-regulated house has an attic of this sort, so I need not  describe it.    The doll's house had been moved, but after a search Martha found it  away over in a corner near the big chimney.    She drew it out and noticed that behind it was a black wooden chest  which Uncle Walter had sent over from Italy years and years  ago--before Martha was born, in fact. Mamma had told her about it  one day; how there was no key to it, because Uncle Walter wished it  to remain unopened until he returned home; and how this wandering  uncle, who was a mighty hunter, had gone into Africa to hunt  elephants and had never been heard from afterwards.    The little girl looked at the chest curiously, now that it had by  accident attracted her attention.    It was quite big--bigger even than mamma's traveling trunk--and was  studded all over with tarnished brassheaded nails. It was heavy,  too, for when Martha tried to lift one end of it she found she could  not stir it a bit. But there was a place in the side of the cover  for a key. She stooped to examine the lock, and saw that it would  take a rather big key to open it.    Then, as you may suspect, the little girl longed to open Uncle  Walter's big box and see what was in it. For we are all curious, and  little girls are just as curious as the rest of us.    \"I don't b'lieve Uncle Walter'll ever come back,\" she thought. \"Papa  said once that some elephant must have killed him. If I only had a  key--\" She stopped and clapped her little hands together gayly as  she remembered a big basket of keys on the shelf in the linen  closet. They were of all sorts and sizes; perhaps one of them would  unlock the mysterious chest!    She flew down the stairs, found the basket and returned with it to  the attic. Then she sat down before the brass-studded box and began  trying one key after another in the curious old lock. Some were too  large, but most were too small. One would go into the lock but would  not turn; another stuck so fast that she feared for a time that she  would never get it out again. But at last, when the basket was  almost empty, an oddly-shaped, ancient brass key slipped easily into  the lock. With a cry of joy Martha turned the key with both hands;  then she heard a sharp \"click,\" and the next moment the heavy lid  flew up of its own accord!    The little girl leaned over the edge of the chest an instant, and  the sight that met her eyes caused her to start back in amazement.    Slowly and carefully a man unpacked himself from the chest, stepped  out upon the floor, stretched his limbs and then took off his hat  and bowed politely to the astonished child.    He was tall and thin and his face seemed badly tanned or sunburnt.    Then another man emerged from the chest, yawning and rubbing his  eyes like a sleepy schoolboy. He was of middle size and his skin  seemed as badly tanned as that of the first.    While Martha stared open-mouthed at the remarkable sight a third man  crawled from the chest. He had the same complexion as his fellows,  but was short and fat.    All three were dressed in a curious manner. They wore short jackets  of red velvet braided with gold, and knee breeches of sky-blue satin  with silver buttons. Over their stockings were laced wide ribbons of  red and yellow and blue, while their hats had broad brims with high,  peaked crowns, from which fluttered yards of bright-colored ribbons.    They had big gold rings in their ears and rows of knives and pistols  in their belts. Their eyes were black and glittering and they wore  long, fierce mustaches, curling at the ends like a pig's tail.    \"My! but you were heavy,\" exclaimed the fat one, when he had pulled  down his velvet jacket and brushed the dust from his sky-blue  breeches. \"And you squeezed me all out of shape.\"    \"It was unavoidable, Luigi,\" responded the thin man, lightly; \"the  lid of the chest pressed me down upon you. Yet I tender you my  regrets.\"    \"As for me,\" said the middle-sized man, carelessly rolling a  cigarette and lighting it, \"you must acknowledge I have been your  nearest friend for years; so do not be disagreeable.\"    \"You mustn't smoke in the attic,\" said Martha, recovering herself at  sight of the cigarette. \"You might set the house on fire.\"    The middle-sized man, who had not noticed her before, at this speech  turned to the girl and bowed.    \"Since a lady requests it,\" said he, \"I shall abandon my cigarette,\"  and he threw it on the floor and extinguished it with his foot.    \"Who are you?\" asked Martha, who until now had been too astonished  to be frightened.    \"Permit us to introduce ourselves,\" said the thin man, flourishing  his hat gracefully. \"This is Lugui,\" the fat man nodded; \"and this  is Beni,\" the middle-sized man bowed; \"and I am Victor. We are three  bandits--Italian bandits.\"    \"Bandits!\" cried Martha, with a look of horror.    \"Exactly. Perhaps in all the world there are not three other bandits  so terrible and fierce as ourselves,\" said Victor, proudly.    \"'Tis so,\" said the fat man, nodding gravely.    \"But it's wicked!\" exclaimed Martha.    \"Yes, indeed,\" replied Victor. \"We are extremely and tremendously  wicked. Perhaps in all the world you could not find three men more  wicked than those who now stand before you.\"    \"'Tis so,\" said the fat man, approvingly.    \"But you shouldn't be so wicked,\" said the girl;  \"it's--it's--naughty!\"    Victor cast down his eyes and blushed.    \"Naughty!\" gasped Beni, with a horrified look.    \"'Tis a hard word,\" said Luigi, sadly, and buried his face in his  hands.    \"I little thought,\" murmured Victor, in a voice broken by emotion,  \"ever to be so reviled--and by a lady! Yet, perhaps you spoke  thoughtlessly. You must consider, miss, that our wickedness has an  excuse. For how are we to be bandits, let me ask, unless we are  wicked?\"    Martha was puzzled and shook her head, thoughtfully. Then she  remembered something.    \"You can't remain bandits any longer,\" said she, \"because you are  now in America.\"    \"America!\" cried the three, together.    \"Certainly. You are on Prairie avenue, in Chicago. Uncle Walter sent  you here from Italy in this chest.\"    The bandits seemed greatly bewildered by this announcement. Lugui  sat down on an old chair with a broken rocker and wiped his forehead  with a yellow silk handkerchief. Beni and Victor fell back upon the  chest and looked at her with pale faces and staring eyes.    When he had somewhat recovered himself Victor spoke.    \"Your Uncle Walter has greatly wronged us,\" he said, reproachfully.  \"He has taken us from our beloved Italy, where bandits are highly  respected, and brought us to a strange country where we shall not  know whom to rob or how much to ask for a ransom.\"    \"'Tis so!\" said the fat man, slapping his leg sharply.    \"And we had won such fine reputations in Italy!\" said Beni,  regretfully.    \"Perhaps Uncle Walter wanted to reform you,\" suggested Martha.    \"Are there, then, no bandits in Chicago?\" asked Victor.    \"Well,\" replied the girl, blushing in her turn, \"we do not call them  bandits.\"    \"Then what shall we do for a living?\" inquired Beni, despairingly.    \"A great deal can be done in a big American city,\" said the child.  \"My father is a lawyer\" (the bandits shuddered), \"and my mother's  cousin is a police inspector.\"    \"Ah,\" said Victor, \"that is a good employment. The police need to be  inspected, especially in Italy.\"    \"Everywhere!\" added Beni.    \"Then you could do other things,\" continued Martha, encouragingly.  \"You could be motor men on trolley cars, or clerks in a department  store. Some people even become aldermen to earn a living.\"    The bandits shook their heads sadly.    \"We are not fitted for such work,\" said Victor. \"Our business is to  rob.\"    Martha tried to think.    \"It is rather hard to get positions in the gas office,\" she said,  \"but you might become politicians.\"    \"N"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#1)"],[1,"JUDITH OF RANDOLPH MASSACHUSETTS          THE SEA FAIRIES    BY L. FRANK BAUM    AUTHOR OF THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ, DOROTHY AND THE  WIZARD IN OZ, OZMA OF OZ, THE ROAD TO OZ,  THE LAND OF OZ, ETC.      ILLUSTRATED BY  JOHN R. NEILL            THE oceans are big and broad. I believe two-thirds of the  earth's surface is covered with water. What people inhabit  this water has always been a subject of curiosity to the  inhabitants of the land. Strange creatures come from the seas  at times, and perhaps in the ocean depths are many, more strange  than mortal eye has ever gazed upon.    This story is fanciful. In it the sea people talk and act  much as we do, and the mermaids especially are not unlike the  fairies with whom we have learned to be familiar. Yet they  are real sea people, for all that, and with the exception of Zog  the Magician they are all supposed to exist in the ocean's depths.    I am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids  or sea-serpents have ever inhabited the oceans, but it would be  very difficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had  lived under the water as Trot and Cap'n Bill did in this story.    I hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's  adventures in the Land of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally  strange experiences. The ocean has always appealed to me as  a veritable wonderland, and this story has been suggested to me  many times by my young correspondents in their letters. Indeed,  a good many children have implored me to \"write something  about the mermaids,\" and I have willingly granted the request.    Hollywood, 1911.    L. FRANK BAUM.

They were seated on a bench built around a giant acacia tree that  grew just at the edge of the bluff. Below them rolled the blue waves  of the great Pacific. A little way behind them was the house, a neat  frame cottage painted white and surrounded by huge eucalyptus and  pepper trees. Still farther behind that--a quarter of a mile distant  but built upon a bend of the coast--was the village, overlooking a  pretty bay.    Cap'n Bill and Trot came often to this tree to sit and watch the  ocean below them. The sailor man had one \"meat leg\" and one \"hickory  leg,\" and he often said the wooden one was the best of the two. Once  Cap'n Bill had commanded and owned the \"Anemone,\" a trading schooner  that plied along the coast; and in those days Charlie Griffiths, who  was Trot's father, had been the Captain's mate. But ever since Cap'n  Bill's accident, when he lost his leg, Charlie Griffiths had been  the captain of the little schooner while his old master lived  peacefully ashore with the Griffiths family.    This was about the time Trot was born, and the old sailor became  very fond of the baby girl. Her real name was Mayre, but when she  grew big enough to walk, she took so many busy little steps every  day that both her mother and Cap'n Bill nicknamed her \"Trot,\" and so  she was thereafter mostly called.    It was the old sailor who taught the child to love the sea, to love  it almost as much as he and her father did, and these two, who  represented the \"beginning and the end of life,\" became firm friends  and constant companions.    \"Why hasn't anybody seen a mermaid and lived?\" asked Trot again.    \"'Cause mermaids is fairies, an' ain't meant to be seen by us mortal  folk,\" replied Cap'n Bill.    \"But if anyone happens to see 'em, what then, Cap'n?\"    \"Then,\" he answered, slowly wagging his head, \"the mermaids give 'em  a smile an' a wink, an' they dive into the water an' gets drownded.\"    \"S'pose they knew how to swim, Cap'n Bill?\"    \"That don't make any diff'rence, Trot. The mermaids live deep down,  an' the poor mortals never come up again.\"    The little girl was thoughtful for a moment. \"But why do folks dive  in the water when the mermaids smile an' wink?\" she asked.    \"Mermaids,\" he said gravely, \"is the most beautiful creatures in the  world--or the water, either. You know what they're like, Trot,  they's got a lovely lady's form down to the waist, an' then the  other half of 'em's a fish, with green an' purple an' pink scales  all down it.\"    \"Have they got arms, Cap'n Bill?\"    \"'Course, Trot; arms like any other lady. An' pretty faces that  smile an' look mighty sweet an' fetchin'. Their hair is long an'  soft an' silky, an' floats all around 'em in the water. When they  comes up atop the waves, they wring the water out'n their hair and  sing songs that go right to your heart. If anybody is unlucky enough  to be 'round jes' then, the beauty o' them mermaids an' their sweet  songs charm 'em like magic; so's they plunge into the waves to get  to the mermaids. But the mermaids haven't any hearts, Trot, no  more'n a fish has; so they laughs when the poor people drown an'  don't care a fig. That's why I says, an' I says it true, that nobody  never sawr a mermaid an' lived to tell the tale.\"    \"Nobody?\" asked Trot.    \"Nobody a tall.\"    \"Then how do you know, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the little girl, looking  up into his face with big, round eyes.    Cap'n Bill coughed. Then he tried to sneeze, to gain time. Then he  took out his red cotton handkerchief and wiped his bald head with  it, rubbing hard so as to make him think clearer. \"Look, Trot; ain't  that a brig out there?\" he inquired, pointing to a sail far out in  the sea.    \"How does anybody know about mermaids if those who have seen them  never lived to tell about them?\" she asked again.    \"Know what about 'em, Trot?\"    \"About their green and pink scales and pretty songs and wet hair.\"    \"They don't know, I guess. But mermaids jes' natcherly has to be  like that, or they wouldn't be mermaids.\"    She thought this over. \"Somebody MUST have lived, Cap'n Bill,\" she  declared positively. \"Other fairies have been seen by mortals; why  not mermaids?\"    \"P'raps they have, Trot, p'raps they have,\" he answered musingly.  \"I'm tellin' you as it was told to me, but I never stopped to  inquire into the matter so close before. Seems like folks wouldn't  know so much about mermaids if they hadn't seen 'em; an' yet  accordin' to all accounts the victim is bound to get drownded.\"    \"P'raps,\" suggested Trot softly, \"someone found a fotygraph of one  of 'em.\"    \"That might o' been, Trot, that might o' been,\" answered Cap'n Bill.    A nice man was Cap'n Bill, and Trot knew he always liked to explain  everything so she could fully understand it. The aged sailor was not  a very tall man, and some people might have called him chubby, or  even fat. He wore a blue sailor shirt with white anchors worked on  the corners of the broad, square collar, and his blue trousers were  very wide at the bottom. He always wore one trouser leg over his  wooden limb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag  because it was so wide and the wooden leg so slender. His rough  kersey coat was a pea-jacket and came down to his waistline. In the  big pockets of his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife, and his  pipe and tobacco, and many bits of string, and matches and keys and  lots of other things. Whenever Cap'n Bill thrust a chubby hand into  one of his pockets, Trot watched him with breathless interest, for  she never knew what he was going to pull out.    The old sailor's face was brown as a berry. He had a fringe of hair  around the back of his head and a fringe of whisker around the edge  of his face, running from ear to ear and underneath his chin. His  eyes were light blue and kind in expression. His nose was big and  broad, and his few teeth were not strong enough to crack nuts with.    Trot liked Cap'n Bill and had a great deal of confidence in his  wisdom, and a great admiration for his ability to make tops and  whistles and toys with that marvelous jackknife of his. In the  village were many boys and girls of her own age, but she never had  as much fun playing with them as she had wandering by the sea  accompanied by the old sailor and listening to his fascinating  stories.    She knew all about the Flying Dutchman, and Davy Jones' Locker, and  Captain Kidd, and how to harpoon a whale or dodge an iceberg or  lasso a seal. Cap'n Bill had been everywhere in the world, almost,  on his many voyages. He had been wrecked on desert islands like  Robinson Crusoe and been attacked by cannibals, and had a host of  other exciting adventures. So he was a delightful comrade for the  little girl, and whatever Cap'n Bill knew Trot was sure to know in  time.    \"How do the mermaids live?\" she asked. \"Are they in caves, or just  in the water like fishes, or how?\"    \"Can't say, Trot,\" he replied. \"I've asked divers about that, but  none of 'em ever run acrost a mermaid's nest yet, as I've heard of.\"    \"If they're fairies,\" she said, \"their homes must be very pretty.\"    \"Mebbe so, Trot, but damp. They are sure to be damp, you know.\"    \"I'd like to see a mermaid, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child earnestly.    \"What, an' git drownded?\" he exclaimed.    \"No, and live to tell the tale. If they're beautiful, and laughing,  and sweet, there can't be much harm in"]]]
