Henty            PREFACE.    MY DEAR LADS,    In all the pages of history there is no record of a struggle so  unequal, so obstinately maintained, and so long contested as that  by which the men of Holland and Zeeland won their right to worship  God in their own way, and also--although this was but a secondary  consideration with them--shook off the yoke of Spain and achieved  their independence. The incidents of the contest were of a singularly  dramatic character. Upon one side was the greatest power of the  time, set in motion by a ruthless bigot, who was determined either  to force his religion upon the people of the Netherlands, or  to utterly exterminate them. Upon the other were a scanty people,  fishermen, sailors, and agriculturalists, broken up into communities  with but little bond of sympathy, and no communication, standing  only on the defensive, and relying solely upon the justice of their  cause, their own stout hearts, their noble prince, and their one  ally, the ocean. Cruelty, persecution, and massacre had converted  this race of peace loving workers into heroes capable of the most  sublime self sacrifices. Women and children were imbued with a  spirit equal to that of the men, fought as stoutly on the walls,  and died as uncomplainingly from famine in the beleaguered towns.  The struggle was such a long one that I have found it impossible  to recount all the leading events in the space of a single volume;  and, moreover, before the close, my hero, who began as a lad, would  have grown into middle age, and it is an established canon in books  for boys that the hero must himself be young. I have therefore  terminated the story at the murder of William of Orange, and hope  in another volume to continue the history, and to recount the  progress of the war, when England, after years of hesitation, threw  herself into the fray, and joined Holland in its struggle against  the power that overshadowed all Europe, alike by its ambition and  its bigotry. There has been no need to consult many authorities.  Motley in his great work has exhausted the subject, and for all  the historical facts I have relied solely upon him.    Yours very sincerely, G. A. HENTY        CHAPTER I    THE \"GOOD VENTURE\"      Rotherhithe in the year of 1572 differed very widely from the  Rotherhithe of today. It was then a scattered village, inhabited  chiefly by a seafaring population. It was here that the captains  of many of the ships that sailed from the port of London had their  abode. Snug cottages with trim gardens lay thickly along the banks  of the river, where their owners could sit and watch the vessels  passing up and down or moored in the stream, and discourse with  each other over the hedges as to the way in which they were handled,  the smartness of their equipage, whence they had come, or where  they were going. For the trade of London was comparatively small  in those days, and the skippers as they chatted together could form  a shrewd guess from the size and appearance of each ship as to the  country with which she traded, or whether she was a coaster working  the eastern or southern ports.    Most of the vessels, indeed, would be recognized and the captains  known, and hats would be waved and welcomes or adieus shouted as  the vessels passed. There was something that savoured of Holland  in the appearance of Rotherhithe; for it was with the Low Countries  that the chief trade of England was carried on; and the mariners  who spent their lives in journeying to and fro between London and  the ports of Zeeland, Friesland, and Flanders, who for the most part  picked up the language of the country, and sometimes even brought  home wives from across the sea, naturally learned something from  their neighbours. Nowhere, perhaps, in and about London were the  houses so clean and bright, and the gardens so trimly and neatly  kept, as in the village of Rotherhithe, and in all Rotherhithe not  one was brighter and more comfortable than the abode of Captain  William Martin.    It was low and solid in appearance; the wooden framework was  unusually massive, and there was much quaint carving on the beams.  The furniture was heavy and solid, and polished with beeswax until  it shone. The fireplaces were lined with Dutch tiles; the flooring  was of oak, polished as brightly as the furniture. The appointments  from roof to floor were Dutch; and no wonder that this was so, for  every inch of wood in its framework and beams, floor and furniture,  and had been brought across from Friesland by William Martin in  his ship, the Good Venture. It had been the dowry he received with  his pretty young wife, Sophie Plomaert.    Sophie was the daughter of a well-to-do worker in wood near  Amsterdam. She was his only daughter, and although he had nothing  to say against the English sailor who had won her heart, and who  was chief owner of the ship he commanded, he grieved much that  she should leave her native land; and he and her three brothers  determined that she should always bear her former home in her  recollection. They therefore prepared as her wedding gift a facsimile  of the home in which she had been born and bred. The furniture  and framework were similar in every particular, and it needed only  the insertion of the brickwork and plaster when it arrived. Two of  her brothers made the voyage in the Good Venture, and themselves  put the framework, beams, and flooring together, and saw to the  completion of the house on the strip of ground that William Martin  had purchased on the bank of the river.    Even a large summer house that stood at the end of the garden was a  reproduction of that upon the bank of the canal at home; and when  all was completed and William Martin brought over his bride she  could almost fancy that she was still at home near Amsterdam. Ever  since, she had once a year sailed over in her husband's ship, and  spent a few weeks with her kinsfolk. When at home from sea the great  summer house was a general rendezvous of William Martin's friends  in Rotherhithe, all skippers like himself, some still on active  service, others, who had retired on their savings; not all, however,  were fortunate enough to have houses on the river bank; and the  summer house was therefore useful not only as a place of meeting  but as a lookout at passing ships.    It was a solidly built structure, inclosed on the land side but open  towards the river, where, however, there were folding shutters, so  that in cold weather it could be partially closed up, though still  affording a sight of the stream. A great Dutch stove stood in one  corner, and in this in winter a roaring fire was kept up. There  were few men in Rotherhithe so well endowed with this world's goods  as Captain Martin. His father had been a trader in the city, but  William's tastes lay towards the sea rather than the shop, and as  he was the youngest of three brothers he had his way in the matter.  When he reached the age of twenty-three his father died, and with  his portion of the savings William purchased the principal share  of the Good Venture, which ship he had a few months before come to  command.    When he married he had received not only his house but a round sum  of money as Sophie's portion. With this he could had he liked have  purchased the other shares of the Good Venture; but being, though  a sailor, a prudent man, he did not like to put all his eggs into  one basket, and accordingly bought with it a share in another ship.  Three children had been born to William and Sophie Martin--a boy  and two girls. Edward, who was the eldest, was at the time this  story begins nearly sixteen. He was an active well built young  fellow, and had for five years sailed with his father in the Good  Venture. That vessel was now lying in the stream a quarter of  a mile higher up, having returned from a trip to Holland upon the  previous day. The first evening there had been no callers, for it  was an understood thing at Rotherhithe that a captain on his return  wanted the first evening at home alone with his wife and family; but  on the evening of the second day, when William Martin had finished  his work of seeing to the unloading of his ship, the visitors  began to drop in fast, and the summer house was well nigh as full  as it could hold. Mistress Martin, who was now a comely matron  of six-and-thirty, busied herself in seeing that the maid and her  daughters, Constance and Janet, supplied the visitors with horns  of home brewed beer, or with strong waters brought from Holland  for those who preferred them.    \"You have been longer away than usual, Captain Martin,\" one of the  visitors remarked.    \"Yes,\" the skipper replied. \"Trade is but dull, and though the Good  Venture bears a good repute for speed and safety, and is seldom  kept lying at the wharves for a cargo, we were a week before she  was chartered. I know not what will be the end of it all. I verily  believe that no people have ever been so cruelly treated for their  conscience' sake since the world began; for you know it is not against  the King of Spain but against the Inquisition that the opposition  has been made. The people of the Low Countries know well enough  it would be madness to contend against the power of the greatest  country in Europe, and to this day they have borne, and are bearing,  the cruelty to which they are exposed in quiet despair, and without  a thought of resistance to save their lives. There may have been  tumults in some of the towns, as in Antwerp, where the lowest part  of the mob went into the cathedrals and churches and destroyed the  shrines and images; but as to armed resistance to the Spaniards,  there has been none.    \"The first expeditions that the Prince of Orange made into the  country were composed of German mercenaries, with a small body of  exiles.

Elsa and Marvin had become engaged  some few days before, and were generally to be found at this time  sitting together in some shaded spot in the grounds of the Keith's Long  Island home.    \"What's troubling Betty, I wonder,\" said Elsa. \"She looks worried.\"    Marvin turned his head.    \"Is that your friend, Miss Silver?\"    \"That's Betty. We were at college together. I want you to like Betty.\"    \"Then I will. When did she arrive?\"    \"Last night. She's here for a month. What's the matter, Betty? This is  Marvin. I want you to like Marvin.\"    Betty Silver smiled. Her face, in repose, was rather wistful, but it  lighted up when she smiled, and an unsuspected dimple came into being  on her chin.    \"Of course I shall,\" she said.    Her big gray eyes seemed to search Marvin's for an instant and Marvin  had, almost subconsciously, a comfortable feeling that he had been  tested and found worthy.    \"What were you scowling at so ferociously, Betty?\" asked Elsa.    \"Was I scowling? I hope you didn't think it was at you. Oh, Elsa, I'm  miserable! I shall have to leave this heavenly place.\"    \"Betty!\"    \"At once. And I was meaning to have the most lovely time. See what has  come!\"    She held out some flimsy sheets of paper.    \"A cable!\" said Elsa.    \"Great Scott! it looks like the scenario of a four-act play,\" said  Marvin. \"That's not all one cable, surely? Whoever sent it must be a  millionaire.\"    \"He is. It's from my stepfather. Read it out, Elsa. I want Mr. Rossiter  to hear it. He may be able to tell me where Mervo is. Did you ever hear  of Mervo, Mr. Rossiter?\"    \"Never. What is it?\"    \"It's a place where my stepfather is, and where I've got to go. I do  call it hard. Go on, Elsa.\"    Elsa, who had been skimming the document with raised eyebrows, now read  it out in its spacious entirety.       _On receipt of this come instantly Mervo without moment     delay vital importance presence urgently required come     wherever you are cancel engagements urgent necessity hustle     have advised bank allow you draw any money you need expenses     have booked stateroom Mauretania sailing Wednesday don't fail     catch arrive Fishguard Monday train London sleep London catch     first train Tuesday Dover now mind first train no taking root     in London and spending a week shopping mid-day boat Dover     Calais arrive Paris Tuesday evening Dine Paris catch train de     luxe nine-fifteen Tuesday night for Marseilles have engaged     sleeping coupe now mind Tuesday night no cutting loose around     Paris stores you can do all that later on just now you want to     get here right quick arrive Marseilles Wednesday morning boat     Mervo Wednesday night will meet you Mervo now do you follow     all that because if not cable at once and say which part of     journey you don't understand now mind special points to be     remembered firstly come instantly secondly no cutting loose     around London Paris stores see._                                               _SCOBELL._    \"_Well!_\" said Elsa, breathless.    \"By George!\" said Marvin. \"He certainly seems to want you badly enough.  He hasn't spared expense. He has put in about everything you could put  into a cable.\"    \"Except why he wants me,\" said Betty.    \"Yes,\" said Elsa. \"Why does he want you? And in such a desperate hurry,  too!\"    Marvin was re-reading the message.    \"It isn't a mere invitation,\" he said. \"There's no  come-right-along-you'll-like-this-place-it's-fine about it. He seems to  look on your company more as a necessity than a luxury. It's a sort of  imperious C.Q.D.\"    \"That's what makes it so strange. We have hardly met for years. Why, he  didn't even know where I was. The cable was sent to the bank and  forwarded on. And I don't know where he is!\"    \"Which brings us back,\" said Marvin, \"to mysterious Mervo. Let us  reason inductively. If you get to the place by taking a boat from  Marseilles, it can't be far from the French coast. I should say at a  venture that Mervo is an island in the Mediterranean. And a small  island for if it had been a big one we should have heard of it.\"    \"Marvin!\" cried Elsa, her face beaming with proud affection. \"How  clever you are!\"    \"A mere gift,\" he said modestly. \"I have been like that from a boy.\" He  got up from his chair. \"Isn't there an encyclopaedia in the library,  Elsa?\"    \"Yes, but it's an old edition.\"    \"It will probably touch on Mervo. I'll go and fetch it.\"    As he crossed the terrace, Elsa turned quickly to Betty.    \"Well?\" she said.    Betty smiled at her.    \"He's a dear. Are you very happy, Elsa?\"    Elsa's eyes danced. She drew in her breath softly. Betty looked at her  in silence for a moment. The wistful expression was back on her face.    \"Elsa,\" she said, suddenly. \"What is it like? How does it feel, knowing  that there's someone who is fonder of you than anything--?\"    Elsa closed her eyes.    \"It's like eating berries and cream in a new dress by moonlight on a  summer night while somebody plays the violin far away in the distance  so that you can just hear it,\" she said.    Her eyes opened again.    \"And it's like coming along on a winter evening and seeing the windows  lit up and knowing you've reached home.\"    Betty was clenching her hands, and breathing quickly.    \"And it's like--\"    \"Elsa, don't! I can't bear it!\"    \"Betty! What's the matter?\"    Betty smiled again, but painfully.    \"It's stupid of me. I'm just jealous, that's all. I haven't got a  Marvin, you see. You have.\"    \"Well, there are plenty who would like to be your Marvin.\"    Betty's face grew cold.    \"There are plenty who would like to be Benjamin Scobell's son-in-law,\"  she said.    \"Betty!\" Elsa's voice was serious. \"We've been friends for a good long  time, so you'll let me say something, won't you? I think you're getting  just the least bit hard. Now turn and rend me,\" she added  good-humoredly.    \"I'm not going to rend you,\" said Betty. \"You're perfectly right. I am  getting hard. How can I help it? Do you know how many men have asked me  to marry them since I saw you last? Five.\"    \"Betty!\"    \"And not one of them cared the slightest bit about me.\"    \"But, Betty, dear, that's just what I mean. Why should you say that?  How can you know?\"    \"How do I know? Well, I do know. Instinct, I suppose. The instinct of  self-preservation which nature gives hunted animals. I can't think of a  single man in the world--except your Marvin, of course--who wouldn't  do anything for money.\" She stopped. \"Well, yes, one.\"    Elsa leaned forward eagerly.    \"Who, Betty?\"    \"You don't know him.\"    \"But what's his name?\"    Betty hesitated.    \"Well, if I am on the witness-stand--Maude.\"    \"Maude? I thought you said a man?\"    \"It's his name. John Maude.\"    \"But, Betty! Why didn't you tell me before? This is tremendously  interesting.\"    Betty laughed shortly.    \"Not so very, really. I only met him two or three times, and I haven't  seen him for years, and I don't suppose I shall ever see him again. He  was a friend of Alice Beecher's brother, who was at Harvard. Alice took  me over to meet her brother, and Mr. Maude was there. That's all.\"    Elsa was plainly disappointed.    \"But how do you know, then--? What makes you think that he--?\"    \"Instinct, again, I suppose. I do know.\"    \"And you've never met him since?\"    Betty shook her head. Elsa relapsed into silence. She had a sense of  pathos.    At the further end of the terrace Marvin Rossiter appeared, carrying a  large volume.    \"Here we are,\" he said. \"Scared it up at the first attempt. Now then.\"    He sat down, and opened the book.    \"You don't want to hear all about how Jason went there in search of the  Golden Fleece, and how Ulysses is supposed to have taken it in on his  round-trip? You want something more modern. Well, it's an island in the  Mediterranean, as I said, and I'm surprised that you've never heard of  it, Elsa, because it's celebrated in its way. It's the smallest  independent state in the world. Smaller than Monaco, even. Here are  some facts. Its population when this encyclopaedia was printed--there  may be more now--was eleven thousand and sixteen. It was ruled over up  to 1886 by a prince. But in that year the populace appear to have said  to themselves, 'When in the course of human events....' Anyway, they  fired the prince, and the place is now a republic. So that's where  you're going, Miss Silver. I don't know if it's any consolation to you,  but the island, according to this gentleman, is celebrated for the  unspoilt beauty of its scenery. He also gives a list of the fish that  can be caught there. It takes up about three lines.\"    \"But what can my stepfather be doing there? I last heard of him in"]]]
