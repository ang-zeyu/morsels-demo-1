The birth of Apollonius Rhodius  is placed by scholars at various times between 296 and 260 B.C., while  the year of his death is equally uncertain. In fact, we have very little  information on the subject. There are two \"lives\" of Apollonius in the  Scholia, both derived from an earlier one which is lost. From these we  learn that he was of Alexandria by birth, [1001] that he lived in the  time of the Ptolemies, and was a pupil of Callimachus; that while still  a youth he composed and recited in public his \"Argonautica\", and that  the poem was condemned, in consequence of which he retired to Rhodes;  that there he revised his poem, recited it with great applause, and  hence called himself a Rhodian. The second \"life\" adds: \"Some say that  he returned to Alexandria and again recited his poem with the utmost  success, so that he was honoured with the libraries of the Museum and  was buried with Callimachus.\" The last sentence may be interpreted by  the notice of Suidas, who informs us that Apollonius was a contemporary  of Eratosthenes, Euphorion and Timarchus, in the time of Ptolemy  Euergetes, and that he succeeded Eratosthenes in the headship of the  Alexandrian Library. Suidas also informs us elsewhere that Aristophanes  at the age of sixty-two succeeded Apollonius in this office. Many modern  scholars deny the \"bibliothecariate\" of Apollonius for chronological  reasons, and there is considerable difficulty about it. The date of  Callimachus' \"Hymn to Apollo\", which closes with some lines (105-113)  that are admittedly an allusion to Apollonius, may be put with much  probability at 248 or 247 B.C. Apollonius must at that date have been at  least twenty years old. Eratosthenes died 196-193 B.C. This would make  Apollonius seventy-two to seventy-five when he succeeded Eratosthenes.  This is not impossible, it is true, but it is difficult. But the  difficulty is taken away if we assume with Ritschl that Eratosthenes  resigned his office some years before his death, which allows us to  put the birth of Apollonius at about 280, and would solve other  difficulties. For instance, if the Librarians were buried within  the precincts, it would account for the burial of Apollonius next to  Callimachus--Eratosthenes being still alive. However that may be, it  is rather arbitrary to take away the \"bibliothecariate\" of Apollonius,  which is clearly asserted by Suidas, on account of chronological  calculations which are themselves uncertain. Moreover, it is more  probable that the words following \"some say\" in the second \"life\" are  a remnant of the original life than a conjectural addition, because the  first \"life\" is evidently incomplete, nothing being said about the end  of Apollonius' career.    The principal event in his life, so far as we know, was the quarrel  with his master Callimachus, which was most probably the cause of his  condemnation at Alexandria and departure to Rhodes. This quarrel appears  to have arisen from differences of literary aims and taste, but, as  literary differences often do, degenerated into the bitterest personal  strife. There are references to the quarrel in the writings of both.  Callimachus attacks Apollonius in the passage at the end of the \"Hymn to  Apollo\", already mentioned, also probably in some epigrams, but most of  all in his \"Ibis\", of which we have an imitation, or perhaps nearly a  translation, in Ovid's poem of the same name. On the part of Apollonius  there is a passage in the third book of the \"Argonautica\" (11. 927-947)  which is of a polemical nature and stands out from the context, and the  well-known savage epigram upon Callimachus. [1002] Various combinations  have been attempted by scholars, notably by Couat, in his \"Poesie  Alexandrine\", to give a connected account of the quarrel, but we have  not data sufficient to determine the order of the attacks, and replies,  and counter-attacks. The \"Ibis\" has been thought to mark the termination  of the feud on the curious ground that it was impossible for abuse to go  further. It was an age when literary men were more inclined to comment  on writings of the past than to produce original work. Literature was  engaged in taking stock of itself. Homer was, of course, professedly  admired by all, but more admired than imitated. Epic poetry was out  of fashion and we find many epigrams of this period--some by  Callimachus--directed against the \"cyclic\" poets, by whom were meant at  that time those who were always dragging in conventional and commonplace  epithets and phrases peculiar to epic poetry. Callimachus was in  accordance with the spirit of the age when he proclaimed \"a great book\"  to be \"a great evil\", and sought to confine poetical activity within the  narrowest limits both of subject and space. Theocritus agreed with  him, both in principle and practice. The chief characteristics of  Alexandrianism are well summarized by Professor Robinson Ellis as  follows: \"Precision in form and metre, refinement in diction, a learning  often degenerating into pedantry and obscurity, a resolute avoidance of  everything commonplace in subject, sentiment or allusion.\" These traits  are more prominent in Callimachus than in Apollonius, but they are  certainly to be seen in the latter. He seems to have written the  \"Argonautica\" out of bravado, to show that he could write an epic poem.  But the influence of the age was too strong. Instead of the unity of an  Epic we have merely a series of episodes, and it is the great beauty  and power of one of these episodes that gives the poem its permanent  value--the episode of the love of Jason and Medea. This occupies the  greater part of the third book. The first and second books are taken  up with the history of the voyage to Colchis, while the fourth book  describes the return voyage. These portions constitute a metrical guide  book, filled no doubt with many pleasing episodes, such as the rape  of Hylas, the boxing match between Pollux and Amyeus, the account of  Cyzicus, the account of the Amazons, the legend of Talos, but there is  no unity running through the poem beyond that of the voyage itself.    The Tale of the Argonauts had been told often before in verse and prose,  and many authors' names are given in the Scholia to Apollonius, but  their works have perished. The best known earlier account that we have  is that in Pindar's fourth Pythian ode, from which Apollonius has taken  many details. The subject was one for an epic poem, for its unity might  have been found in the working out of the expiation due for the crime of  Athamas; but this motive is barely mentioned by our author.    As we have it, the motive of the voyage is the command of Pelias to  bring back the golden fleece, and this command is based on Pelias'  desire to destroy Jason, while the divine aid given to Jason results  from the intention of Hera to punish Pelias for his neglect of the  honour due to her. The learning of Apollonius is not deep but it is  curious; his general sentiments are not according to the Alexandrian  standard, for they are simple and obvious. In the mass of material from  which he had to choose the difficulty was to know what to omit, and much  skill is shown in fusing into a tolerably harmonious whole conflicting  mythological and historical details. He interweaves with his narrative  local legends and the founding of cities, accounts of strange customs,  descriptions of works of art, such as that of Ganymede and Eros playing  with knucklebones, [1003] but prosaically calls himself back to the  point from these pleasing digressions by such an expression as \"but this  would take me too far from my song.\" His business is the straightforward  tale and nothing else. The astonishing geography of the fourth book  reminds us of the interest of the age in that subject, stimulated no  doubt by the researches of Eratosthenes and others.    The language is that of the conventional epic. Apollonius seems to have  carefully studied Homeric glosses, and gives many examples of isolated  uses, but his choice of words is by no means limited to Homer. He freely  avails himself of Alexandrian words and late uses of Homeric words.  Among his contemporaries Apollonius suffers from a comparison with  Theocritus, who was a little his senior, but he was much admired by  Roman writers who derived inspiration from the great classical writers  of Greece by way of Alexandria. In fact Alexandria was a useful bridge  between Athens and Rome. The \"Argonautica\" was translated by Varro  Atacinus, copied by Ovid and Virgil, and minutely studied by Valerius  Flaccus in his poem of the same name. Some of his finest passages have  been appropriated and improved upon by Virgil by the divine right of  superior genius.

The acquaintance of  students with the work of Chretien has been made possible in academic  circles by the admirable critical editions of his romances undertaken  and carried to completion during the past thirty years by Professor  Wendelin Foerster of Bonn. At the same time the want of public  familiarity with Chretien's work is due to the almost complete lack of  translations of his romances into the modern tongues. The man who, so  far as we know, first recounted the romantic adventures of Arthur's  knights, Gawain. Yvain, Erec, Lancelot, and Perceval, has been  forgotten; whereas posterity has been kinder to his debtors, Wolfram  yon Eschenbach, Malory, Lord Tennyson, and Richard Wagner. The present  volume has grown out of the desire to place these romances of adventure  before the reader of English in a prose version based directly upon the  oldest form in which they exist.    Such extravagant claims for Chretien's art have been made in some  quarters that one feels disinclined to give them even an echo here.  The modem reader may form his own estimate of the poet's art, and that  estimate will probably not be high. Monotony, lack of proportion,  vain repetitions, insufficient motivation, wearisome subtleties, and  threatened, if not actual, indelicacy are among the most salient defects  which will arrest, and mayhap confound, the reader unfamiliar with  mediaeval literary craft. No greater service can be performed by an  editor in such a case than to prepare the reader to overlook these  common faults, and to set before him the literary significance of this  twelfth-century poet.    Chretien de Troyes wrote in Champagne during the third quarter of the  twelfth century. Of his life we know neither the beginning nor the  end, but we know that between 1160 and 1172 he lived, perhaps as  herald-at-arms (according to Gaston Paris, based on \"Lancelot\" 5591-94)  at Troyes, where was the court of his patroness, the Countess Marie de  Champagne. She was the daughter of Louis VII, and of that famous Eleanor  of Aquitaine, as she is called in English histories, who, coming from  the South of France in 1137, first to Paris and later to England, may  have had some share in the introduction of those ideals of courtesy and  woman service which were soon to become the cult of European society.  The Countess Marie, possessing her royal mother's tastes and gifts, made  of her court a social experiment station, where these Provencal ideals  of a perfect society were planted afresh in congenial soil. It appears  from contemporary testimony that the authority of this celebrated feudal  dame was weighty, and widely felt. The old city of Troyes, where she  held her court, must be set down large in any map of literary history.  For it was there that Chretien was led to write four romances which  together form the most complete expression we possess from a single  author of the ideals of French chivalry. These romances, written in  eight-syllable rhyming couplets, treat respectively of Erec and Enide,  Cliges, Yvain, and Lancelot. Another poem, \"Perceval le Gallois\", was  composed about 1175 for Philip, Count of Flanders, to whom Chretien was  attached during his last years. This last poem is not included in  the present translation because of its extraordinary length of 32,000  verses, because Chretien wrote only the first 9000 verses, and because  Miss Jessie L. Weston has given us an English version of Wolfram's  well-known \"Parzival\", which tells substantially the same story, though  in a different spirit. To have included this poem, of which he wrote  less than one-third, in the works of Chretien would have been unjust to  him. It is true the romance of \"Lancelot\" was not completed by Chretien,  we are told, but the poem is his in such large part that one would be  over-scrupulous not to call it his. The other three poems mentioned are  his entire. In addition, there are quite generally assigned to the poet  two insignificant lyrics, the pious romance of \"Guillaume d'Angleterre\",  and the elaboration of an episode from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" (vi.,  426-674) called \"Philomena\" by its recent editor (C. de Boer, Paris,  1909). All these are extant and accessible. But since \"Guillaume  d'Angleterre\" and \"Philomena\" are not universally attributed to  Chretien, and since they have nothing to do with the Arthurian material,  it seems reasonable to limit the present enterprise to \"Erec and Enide\",  \"Cliges\", \"Yvain\", and \"Lancelot\".    Professor Foerster, basing his remark upon the best knowledge we possess  of an obscure matter, has called \"Erec and Enide\" the oldest Arthurian  romance extant. It is not possible to dispute this significant claim,  but let us make it a little more intelligible. Scholarship has shown  that from the early Middle Ages popular tradition was rife in Britain  and Brittany. The existence of these traditions common to the Brythonic  peoples was called to the attention of the literary world by William of  Malmesbury (\"Gesta regum Anglorum\") and Geoffrey of Monmouth (\"Historia  regum Britanniae\") in their Latin histories about 1125 and 1137  respectively, and by the Anglo-Norman poet Wace immediately afterward.  Scholars have waged war over the theories of transmission of the  so-called Arthurian material during the centuries which elapsed  between the time of the fabled chieftain's activity in 500 A.D. and  his appearance as a great literary personage in the twelfth century.  Documents are lacking for the dark ages of popular tradition before the  Norman Conquest, and the theorists may work their will. But Arthur and  his knights, as we see them in the earliest French romances, have little  in common with their Celtic prototypes, as we dimly catch sight of them  in Irish, Welsh, and Breton legend. Chretien belonged to a generation  of French poets who rook over a great mass of Celtic folk-lore they  imperfectly understood, and made of what, of course, it had never been  before: the vehicle to carry a rich freight of chivalric customs and  ideals. As an ideal of social conduct, the code of chivalry never  touched the middle and lower classes, but it was the religion of the  aristocracy and of the twelfth-century \"honnete homme\". Never was  literature in any age closer to the ideals of a social class. So true is  this that it is difficult to determine whether social practices  called forth the literature, or whether, as in the case of the  seventeenth-century pastoral romance in France, it is truer to say that  literature suggested to society its ideals. Be that as it may, it is  proper to observe that the French romances of adventure portray  late mediaeval aristocracy as it fain would be. For the glaring  inconsistencies between the reality and the ideal, one may turn to the  chronicles of the period. Yet, even history tells of many an ugly sin  rebuked and of many a gallant deed performed because of the courteous  ideals of chivalry. The debt of our own social code to this literature  of courtesy and frequent self-sacrifice is perfectly manifest.    What Chretien's immediate and specific source was for his romances is of  deep"]]]
