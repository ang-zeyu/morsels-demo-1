From the Spanish of ARMANDO PALACIO VALDÉS.      He was born blind, and had been taught the one thing which the blind  generally learn,--music; for this art he was specially gifted. His  mother died when he was little more than a child, and his father,  who was the first cornetist of a military band, followed her to the  grave a few years later. He had a brother in America from whom he had  never heard; still, through indirect sources he knew him to be well  off, married, and the father of two fine children. To the day of his  death the old musician, indignant at his son's ingratitude, would  not allow his name to be mentioned in his presence; but the blind  boy's affection for his brother remained unchanged. He could not  forget that this elder brother had been the support of his childhood,  the defence of his weakness against the other boys, and that he had  always spoken to him with kindness. The recollection of Santiago's  voice as he entered his room in the morning, shouting, \"Hey there,  Juanito! get up, man; don't sleep so!\" rang in the blind boy's ears  with a more pleasing harmony than could ever be drawn from the keys  of a piano or the strings of a violin. Was it probable that such a  kind heart had grown cold? Juan could not believe it, and was always  striving to justify him. At times the fault was with the mail, or  it might be that his brother did not wish to write until he could  send them a good deal of money; then again, he fancied that he meant  to surprise them by presenting himself some fine day, laden with  gold, in the modest _entresol_ in which they lived. But he never  dared communicate any of these fancies to his father; only when  the old man, wrought to an unusual pitch of exasperation, bitterly  apostrophized the absent one, he found the courage to say: \"You must  not despair, father. Santiago is good, and my heart tells me that we  shall hear from him one of these days.\"    The father died, however, without hearing from his son, between a  priest, who exhorted him, and the blind boy, who clung convulsively  to his hand, as if he meant to detain him in this world by main  force. When the old man's body was removed from the house, the  boy seemed to have lost his reason, and in a frenzy of grief he  struggled with the undertaker's men. Then he was left alone. And what  loneliness was his! No father, no mother, no relatives, no friends;  he was even deprived of the sunlight, which is the friend of all  created things. He was two whole days in his room pacing the floor  like a caged wolf, without tasting food. The chamber-maid, assisted  by a compassionate neighbor, succeeded in saving him from this slow  process of suicide. He was prevailed upon to eat. He spent the rest  of his life praying, and working at his music.    His father, shortly before his death, had obtained for him a position  as organist in one of the churches of Madrid, with a salary of  seventy cents a day. This was scarcely sufficient to meet the running  expenses of a house, however modest; so within a fortnight Juan sold  all that had constituted the furniture of his humble home, dismissed  his servant, and took a room at a boarding-house, for which he paid  forty cents a day; the remaining thirty cents covered all his other  expenses. He lived thus for several months without leaving his room  except to fulfil his obligations. His only walks were from the house  to the church, and from the church back again. His grief weighed  upon him so heavily that he never opened his lips. He spent the long  hours of the day composing a grand requiem Mass for the repose of  his father's soul, depending upon the charity of the parish for its  execution; and although it would be incorrect to say that he strained  his five senses,--on account of his having but four,--it can at least  be said that he threw all the energies of his body and soul into his  work.    The ministerial crisis overtook him before his task was half  finished. I do not remember who came into power, whether the  Radicals, Conservatives, or Constitutionals; at any rate, there was  some great change. The news reached Juan late, and to his sorrow.  The new cabinet soon judged him, in his capacity as an organist, to  be a dangerous citizen, and felt that from the heights of the choir,  at vespers or in the solemnity of the Mass, with the swell and the  roar from all the stops of the organ, he was evincing sentiments of  opposition which were truly scandalous. The new ministers were ill  disposed, as they declared in Congress through the lips of one of  their authorized members, \"to tolerate any form of imposition,\" so  they proceeded with praiseworthy energy to place Juan on the retired  list, and to find him a substitute whose musical manoeuvres might  offer a better guarantee,--a man, in a word, who would prove more  loyal to the institutions. On being officially informed of this,  the blind one experienced no emotion beyond surprise. In the deep  recesses of his heart he was pleased, as he was thus left more time  in which to work at his Mass. The situation appeared to him in its  real light only when his landlady, at the end of the month, came to  him for money. He had none to give her, naturally, as his salary had  been withdrawn; and he was compelled to pawn his father's watch,  after which he resumed his work with perfect serenity and without a  thought of the future. But the landlady came again for money at the  end of another month, and he once more pawned a jewel of the scant  paternal legacy; this was a small diamond ring. In a few months there  was nothing left to pawn. So the landlady, in consideration of his  helplessness, kept him two or three days beyond the time and then  turned him out, with the self-congratulatory feeling of having acted  generously in not claiming his trunk and clothes, from which she  might have realized the few cents that he still owed her.    He looked for another lodging, but was unable to rent a piano, which  was a sore trial to him; evidently he could not finish his Mass. He  knew a shopkeeper who owned a piano and who permitted him to make  use of it. But Juan soon noticed that his visits grew more and more  inopportune, so he left off going. Shortly, too, he was turned out  of his new lodgings, only this time they kept his trunk. Then came  a period of misery and anguish,--of that misery of which it is hard  to conceive. We know that life has few joys for the homeless and  the poor, but if in addition they be blind and alone, surely they  have found the limit of human suffering. Juan was tossed about from  lodging to lodging, lying in bed while his only shirt was being  washed, wandering through the streets of Madrid with torn shoes, his  trousers worn to a fringe about his feet, his hair long, and his  beard unshaven. Some compassionate fellow-lodger obtained a position  for him in a café, from which, however, he was soon turned out, for  its frequenters did not relish his music. He never played popular  dances or peteneras, no fandangos, not even an occasional polka.  His fingers glided over the keys in dreamy ecstasies of Beethoven  and Chopin, and the audience found some difficulty in keeping time  with their spoons. So out he went again through the byways of the  capital. Every now and then some charitable soul, accidentally  brought in contact with his misery, assisted him indirectly, for Juan  shuddered at the thought of begging. He took his meals in some tavern  or other in the lowest quarter of Madrid, ate just enough to keep  from starving, and for two cents he was allowed to sleep in a hovel  between beggars and evil-doers.

PART FIRST.          CHAPTER I.    THE BALL.      The autumn of 18-- was as uncomfortable and _triste_ a season as I have  ever known; commerce and crops alike looked down--respectable prophets  of Tory tendencies shook their heads with redoubled vigor and gloomy  but intense satisfaction at the near approach of that total ruin  they had so often foretold; and the unfortunate devils of starving  mechanics, unable to solve the problem of depression, were raising  shindies by way of relieving their minds. Under these circumstances,  it pleased the Horse Guards, in the plenitude of their power and  inhumanity, to banish Her Majesty's -- Regiment of Light Dragoons to  an infernal region of smoke and \"sansculottism\" situated in the west  of England, and known to mortals as the wealthy and busy town of  Carrington.    Here then were we hurried at the very beginning of grouse shooting,  from first-rate quarters in North Britain.    Terrible was the change which came o'er all our spirits; every thing  was against us; I do not believe I ever saw such rain. Byron talks  about \"nature's tear drops,\"--she gave us a shower bath! The effect  of all this may be imagined. I am certain it was that fatal quarter  confirmed our Major in the deep rooted love for \"Kingston's old port,\"  which finally cut him off at 65, while pretty little Mrs. Pemberton,  the paymaster's wife, no longer guided in the way she should go, by  fashion and the aristocracy, fell from the right path into a meeting  house, and eloped with the preacher! But our rulers care little for our  morals.    _Au commencement_, the rich manufacturers were very civil, and gave  us some most enormous dinners. Their daughters, pretty girls enough,  we found tolerable, as women must always be, even under the most  distressing circumstances; but we had nothing to talk of to them. It  was so confounding to try conversation with girls who had not a single  subject in common with you; who looked on sporting as loss of time, and  to whom all one's allusions, illustrations, and even good stories were  an unknown tongue. Their brothers were \"very awful,\" as Sammy Spectre  says; and, when we asked the fellows to mess, they got so brutally  drunk, and talked such stupid slang, we were thoroughly disgusted; so  when the first terror of burnt mills and broken windows was passed,  and the respectable cotton spinners, taking time to breathe, collected  their scattered faculties, and remembered their dislike to the  military, we were most ready to dispense with their society, and our  communications were soon almost totally cut off.    Such was our position towards the beginning of September, when one  morning, as I was forgetting my misfortunes in Alison's Account of the  Vendean War, which in all probability I should have never read but  for our unlucky change of quarters, Tom Ashley broke into my room,  exclaiming, \"Keep your books for a _dernier ressort_ my dear fellow!  Come along and get your tickets.\"    \"For what,\" said I peevishly, for I am capable of acknowledging an  author's magic sometimes.    \"No humbug! You do not mean to say you have not read the placards  announcing the Festival in the New Music Hall? Grisi, Mario, and all  the rest of them. A grand mass in G, and something still grander in Z?\"    \"No! I know nothing about it.\"    \"Well, know it now! There are to be three days' hard work. Sacred and  scientific in the morning; profane and light in the evening; to wind up  with a fancy and full dress ball on Thursday.\"    \"Well, it is something to do, so I am _à vos ordres, mon cher_,\" said  I, taking my hat.    We found the town full of fresh looking country faces, and, after some  delay and crowding, secured our tickets. The oratorio was very like all  other oratorios; the concert like all other concerts. There were airs  in both that made one think some other world must exist besides this  one of duns and devilry, and art and army agents. But a glance at the  singers, one thought of their characters was quite enough to dispel  any heavenly illusions. I have since tasted the exquisite enjoyment of  hearing the lovely tones and words \"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\"  thrill from pure lips, and then I knew what music meant; but at the  time of which I write I felt that any better feeling roused in me was  false, both in cause and effect.    All our fellows liked music, or were used to it; but I think they were  glad enough to kick their heels at the ball. I found myself there  about eleven o'clock, listening to a very inspiriting quadrille,  and gazing at the pretty little plebs and their snobbish partners,  wondering if they really could be satisfied to waste their sweetness  on such specimens of humanity (for there is a natural refinement  about women); and the brutes were so pre-occupied with self, so  divested of that profound attention I always thought every woman  expected, otherwise there was little to distinguish the gathering  from a ball at Lady Y----s or Lady L----s; the lights, music, and  refreshments, were first rate, the dresses handsome, many in good  taste; the thing wanting was the spirit of easy enjoyment which only  people sufficiently well bred to be natural dare venture on. Occupied  in these philosophic reflections, I stood among a group of my brother  officers, who were mingling their critiques of the morning's concert  with strictures on the mob round us, when my eye was caught by a pair  of fair graceful shoulders to the right in front of me; there was  something indescribable in the proud deer-like carriage of the head,  with its simple classic knot of chestnut brown hair, which made me  almost involuntarily exclaim \"That is a gentlewoman whoever she is;\"  and nervously anxious to see if a _nez retroussé_ or _un nez noble_  adorned the countenance which was hidden from me, I edged my way into  a commanding but unremarkable position. It was neither, but one that  harmonised well with her broad smooth forehead and short tremulous  upper lip; the general expression of the face was a sort of proud  yet gentle sadness, perhaps thoughtfulness is the best word. Above  middle height, her easy rounded figure moved slightly and apparently  unconsciously to the music, while her dress (and this I always  consider a most important characteristic) was very gauzy and white,  and perfectly without ornament except, indeed, a bouquet of brilliant  flowers which seemed to fasten the folds over the bosom. How little  does this miserable description convey the impression of grace and  harmony this fair girl's countenance and figure stamped upon my mind!  but I know were I to write for ever I should still be dissatisfied.    There was a _fierté_ so thorough bred and yet so soft in her air, that  I could have imagined her at home in the most splendid court, and  what rendered this perhaps more striking, was the remarkable contrast  presented by her companions.    She was leaning one arm on the back of a seat occupied by a little thin  woman like a respectable housekeeper, with a fierce contrivance of  lace and flowers on her head; beside her, and also behind the chair,  was a plump comfortable looking man, past middle age, whose round rosy  face was adorned with two little restless laughing twinkling black  eyes; a large bunch of seals to a black ribbon appeared below his  waistcoat in bygone style, held up in a sort of relief by the goodly  protuberance below. As I glanced at these details, this last individual  said something to his beautiful companion with a sort of gravity over  all his face except the eyes; she bent her head gently to hear, and  then her lips parted with such a smile, that I wondered I could have  thought her countenance expressed pride, thought, anything, but happy  merriment: such a smile must come from the heart.        \"And where it most sparkled, no glance could discover      In eyes, lip, or cheek, for she brightened all over.\"    That finished me, \"I must know her, I must dance with her,\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes, but how,\" said Burton, who had been watching me, \"I was trying to  find out who she is before you came in, and no one knows them.\"    \"How very odd,\" said Ashley.    \"She is so strangely unlike the people with her, and all the others,\"  said I.    \"Ah! Egerton has received a death blow.\"    \"Command yourself my dear fellow.\"    \"She must be Cinderella under the chaperonage of the cook and butler.\"    \"I am determined,\" said I, \"to know her, and _selon les régles_; for  that is no young lady to treat with scant ceremony.\"    So saying, I took Burton's arm and moved off to try and catch one  of the Stewards; we succeeded, but the savage would do nothing;  \"didn't like\" and \"could not say.\" So we left him; and Burton was  laughingly pouring forth consolations, when I exclaimed, \"I have  it! I will pretend to recognise her as some acquaintance;--profound  deference--many apologies &c. Eh? get up a little conversation, it  requires nerve, but you know I am half Irish!\"    \"It requires great tact and impudence; I wish you well thro' it,\" said  Burton gravely.    This little conversation took place near a pillar, of which there was a  row, two and two, across both ends of the room, dividing it into three  compartments; the centre and largest of which formed the ball room. On  re-entering it we missed the group of which we were in search, and for  a moment I thought that my inexorable ill-luck had sent them home;  but no! I soon discovered the unmistakeable profile close to the very  pillar at the other side of which we had held our consultation. \"Done!  by all that'"]]]
