Winfield    (Edward Stratemeyer)        INTRODUCTION    My dear boys:    This volume, \"The Rover Boys in the jungle,\" is the third story of  the \"Rover Boys Series,\" and while a complete tale in itself,  forms a companion story to \"The Rover Boys at School\" and \"The  Rover Boys on the Ocean,\" which preceded it.    In the former volumes I told you much of the doings of Dick, Tom,  and Sam at Putnam Hall and during a remarkable chase on the  Atlantic Ocean.  In the present story the scene is shifted from  the military academy, where the boys are cadets, to the wilds of  Africa, whither the lads with their uncle have gone to look for  Anderson Rover, the boys' father, who had disappeared many years  before. A remarkable message from the sea causes the party to  leave this country, and they journey to Africa, little dreaming of  all the stirring adventures which await them in the heart of the  Dark Continent. How they battle against their many perils, and  what the outcome of their remarkable search is, I will leave for  the pages that follow to explain.    In conclusion, let me state that I am extremely grateful for the  kind favor given the previous volumes of this series, and I  sincerely trust that the present tale merits a continuance of your  support.    Affectionately and sincerely yours,    EDWARD STRATEMEYER  November 10, 1899        THE ROVER BOYS IN THE JUNGLE          CHAPTER I    UNPLEASANT NEWS      \"Back to Putnam Hall again, boys!  Hurrah!\"    \"Yes, back again, Tom, and glad of it,\" returned Dick Rover.  \"I  can tell you, the academy is getting to be a regular second home.\"    \"Right you are, Dick,\" came from Sam Rover, the youngest of the  three brothers.  \"I'd rather be here than up to the farm, even if  Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha are kind and considerate.  The farm  is so slow--\"    \"While here we have our full share of adventures and more,\"  finished Tom.  \"I wonder what will happen to us this term?  The  other terms kept us mighty busy, didn't they?\"    \"I'm not looking for any more outside adventures,\" said Dick, with  a serious shake of his head.  \"Our enemies have been disposed of,  and I don't want, to hear of or see them again.\"    \"Nor I--but we'll hear of them, nevertheless, mark my words.  The Baxters won't leave us rest.  They are a hard crowd, and Buddy  Girk is just as bad,\" finished Tom.    It was the opening of the spring term at Putnam Hall Military  Academy, and the three Rover boys had just come up from Cedarville  in the carryall, driven by Peleg Snuggers, the general-utility man  of the place.  Their old chums, Frank Harrington, Fred Garrison,  Larry Colby, and a number of others, had already arrived, so the  boys did not lack for company.  As they entered the spacious  building genial Captain Putnam greeted each with a hearty  handshake, and a pleasant word also came to them from George  Strong, the head assistant.    For the benefit of those who have not read the other books of this  series, entitled \"The Rover Boys at School\" and \"The Rover Boys  on the Ocean,\" I would state that the Rover boys were three in  number, Dick being the oldest, Tom next, and Sam the youngest, as  already mentioned.  Whether the boys were orphans or not was a  question which could not be answered.  Upon the death of their  mother, their father, a rich mine owner and geological expert, had  left the boys in the care of his brother, Randolph Rover, an  eccentric gentleman who devoted his entire time to scientific  farming.  Mr. Anderson Rover had then journeyed to the western  coast of Africa, hoping to locate some valuable gold mines in the  heart of the Dark Continent.  He had plunged into the interior  with a number of natives, and that was the last heard of him,  although Mr. Randolph Rover had made diligent inquiries concerning  his whereabouts.    All of the boys were bright, fun-loving fellows, and to keep them  out of mischief Randolph Rover had sent them off to Putnam Hall, a  first class school, located some distance from Cedarville, a  pretty town on Lake Cayuga, in New York State.  Here the lads had  made numerous friends and incidentally a number of enemies.    Of the friends several have already been named, and others will  come to the front as our story proceeds.  Of the enemies the  principal ones were Arnold Baxter, a man who had tried, years  before, to defraud the boys' father out of a gold mine in the  West, and his son Dan, who had once been the bully of Putnam Hall.  Arnold Baxter's tool was a good-for-nothing scamp named Buddy  Girk, who had once robbed Dick of his watch.  Both of these men  were now in jail charged with an important robbery in Albany, and  the Rover boys had aided in bringing the men to justice.  Dan, the  bully, was also under arrest, charged with the abduction of Dora  Stanhope.  Dora, who was Dick Rover's dearest friend, had been  carried off by the directions of Josiah Crabtree, a former teacher  of Putnam Hall, who wished to marry Mrs. Stanhope and thus get his  hands on the money the widow held in trust for her daughter, but  the abduction had been nipped in the bud and Josiah Crabtree had  fled, leaving Dan Baxter to shoulder the blame of the transaction.  How Dora was restored to her mother and what happened afterward,  old readers already know.    A winter had passed since the events narrated above, and before  and after the holidays the Rover boys had studied diligently, to  make up for the time lost on that never-to-be-forgotten ocean  chase.  Their efforts had not been in vain, and each lad had been  promoted to the next higher class, much to Randolph Rover's  satisfaction and the joy of their tender-hearted Aunt Martha.    \"The boys are all right, even if they do love to play pranks,\" was  Randolph Rover's comment, when he heard of the promotions.  \"I  trust they improve their time during the term to come.\"    \"They are good boys, Randolph,\" returned Mr. Rover.  \"They would  not be real boys if they did not cut up once in a while.  As to  their daring--why, they simply take after their father.  Poor  man.  If only we knew, what had become of him.\"    \"Yes, a great weight would be lifted from our shoulders, Martha,  if we knew that.  But we do not know, and there seems to be no way  of finding out.  I have written to the authorities at various  places in Africa until I know not whom to address next.\"    \"He must be dead, otherwise he would write or come home, Randolph.  He was not one to keep us in the dark so long.\"    \"I cannot believe my brother dead, and the boys will not believe  it either.  Do you know what Dick said to me before he left for  school?  He said, that if we didn't get word he was going to  Africa some day to hunt his father up.\"    \"To Africa!  What will that boy do in such a jungle, and among  such fierce natives?  He will be killed!\"    \"Perhaps not.  The boy is uncommonly shrewd, when it comes to  dealing with his enemies.  Just look how nicely he and Tom and Sam  served Arnold Baxter and those others.  It was wonderful doings--for  boys.\"    \"Yes, but they may not be so successful always, Randolph.  I  should hate to see them run into any more, danger.\"    \"So should I, my dear.  But they will take care of themselves, I  feel that more and more every day,\" concluded Randolph Rover; and  there, for the time being, the subject was dropped.    \"I wonder what has become of old Josiah Crabtree?\" remarked Dick  Rover, as he and his brothers walked around the parade ground to  inspect several improvement which Captain Putnam had caused to be  made.    \"I'm sure I can't guess,\" answered Tom.    \"Like as not he became scared to death.  I suppose you'll be  satisfied if he keeps away from Dora and her mother in the  future?\"    \"Yes; I never want to set eyes on him again, Tom.  He worried the  widow half to death with his strange ways.\"    \"I wonder how the Baxters feel to be locked up?\" put in Sam.  \"I  know Arnold Baxter is used to it, but it's a new experience for  Dan.\"    \"Dan is as bad as his father,\" broke in Larry Colby, who had  joined the brothers.  \"I was glad to hear that Mumps had turned  over a new leaf and cut the bully dead.\"    \"Oh, so were all of us!\" said Tom.  \"By the way, do you know where  Mumps is now?  In the mining business, out West, acting as some  sort of a clerk.\"    \"A spell in the West will take the nonsense out of him,\" came from  Dick.  \"It was a great pity he ever got under Dan Baxter's  influence I wonder how Arnold Baxter is getting along?  He was  quite severely wounded, you know, during that tussle on the  yachts.\"    \"He's about over that, so Frank Harrington says,\" replied Larry.  \"I'll wager he is mighty bitter against you fellows for having put  him where he is.\"    \"It was his own, fault, Larry.  If a person is going to do wrong  he must take the consequences. Mr. Baxter might today be a fairly  well-to-do mine owner of the West and Dan might be a leading cadet  here.  But instead they both threw themselves away--and now they  must take what comes.\"    \"My father used to say it took all kind of people to make a  world,\" went on Larry.  \"But I reckon we could do without the  Baxter and the Buddy Girk kind.\"    \"And the Josiah Crabtree kind,\" added Sam.  \"Don't forget that  miserable sneak.\"    \"Perhaps Crabtree has reformed, like Mumps.\"    \"It wasn't in him to reform, Larry,\" came from Tom.  \"Oh, how I  detested him, with his slick, oily tongue!  I wish they had caught  him and placed him where he deserved to be, with the Baxters.\"    \"Yes, and then we could--\" began Sam, when he stopped.  \"Hullo,  Frank, what are, you running so fast about?\" he cried.    \"Just got a letter from my father!\"  burst out Frank Harrington,  as he came up out of breath.  \"I knew you would want to hear the  news.  Dan Baxter has escaped from jail and the authorities don't  know where to look for him.\"          CHAPTER II  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#1)"],[1,"ROVER BOYS AT SCHOOL    Or    THE CADETS OF PUTNAM HALL    By Arthur M. Winfield  (Edward Stratemeyer)          INTRODUCTION      My Dear Boys:    \"The Rover Boys at School\" has been written that those of you who  have never put in a term or more at an American military academy  for boys may gain some insight into the workings of such an  institution.    While Putnam Hall is not the real name of the particular place of  learning I had in  mind while penning this tale for your amusement  and instruction, there is really such a school, and dear Captain  Putnam is a living person, as are also the lively, wide-awake,  fun-loving Rover brothers, Dick, Tom, and Sam, and their  schoolfellows, Larry, Fred, and Frank.  The same can be said, to a  certain degree, of the bully Dan Baxter, and his toady, the sneak,  commonly known as \"Mumps.\"    The present story is complete in itself, but it is written as the  first of a series, to be followed by \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean\"  and \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" in both of which volumes we  will again meet many of our former characters.    Trusting that this tale will find as much favor in your hands as  have my previous stories, I remain,    Affectionately and sincerely yours,    EDWARD STRATEMEYER          CHAPTER I    INTRODUCING THE ROVER BOYS      \"Hurrah, Sam, it is settled at last that we are to go to boarding  school!\"    \"Are you certain, Tom?  Don't let me raise any false hopes.\"    \"Yes, I am certain, for I heard Uncle Randolph tell Aunt Martha  that he wouldn't keep us in the house another week.  He said he  would rather put up with the Central Park menagerie--think of  that!\" and Tom Rover began  to laugh.    \"That's rather rough on us, but I don't know but what we deserve  it,\" answered Sam Rover, Tom's younger brother.  \"We have been  giving it pretty strong lately, with playing tricks on Sarah the  cook, Jack the hired man, and Uncle Randolph's pet dog Alexander.  But then we had to do something--or go into a dry rot.  Life in  the country is all well enough, but it's mighty slow for me.\"    \"I guess it is slow for anybody brought up in New York, Sam.  Why,  the first week I spent here I thought the stillness would kill me.  I couldn't actually go to sleep because it was so quiet.  I wish  uncle and aunt would move to the city.  They have money enough.\"    \"Aunt Martha likes to be quiet, and uncle is too much wrapped up in  the art of scientific farming, as he calls it. I'll wager he'll stay  on this farm experimenting and writing works on agriculture until he  dies. Well, it's a good enough way to do, I suppose, but it wouldn't  suit me. I want to see something of life--as father did.\"    \"So do I.  Perhaps we'll see something when we get to boarding  school.\"    \"Where are we to go?\"    \"I don't know. Some strict institution, you can be sure of that. Uncle  Randolph told aunty it was time the three of us were taken in hand. He  said Dick wasn't so bad, but you and I--\"    \"Were the bother of his life, eh?\"    \"Something about like that.  He doesn't see any fun in tricks.  He  expects us to just walk around the farm, or study, and, above all  things, keep quiet, so that his scientific investigations are not  disturbed.  Why doesn't he let us go out riding, or boating on the  river, or down to the village to play baseball with the rest of  the fellows?  A real live American boy can't be still all the time,  and he ought to know it,\" and, with a decided shake of his curly  head, Tom Rover took a baseball from his pocket and began to throw  it up against the side of the farmhouse, catching it each time as  it came down.    Tom had thrown the ball up just four times when a pair of blinds  to an upper window flew open with a crash, and the head of a  stern-looking elderly gentleman appeared.  The gentleman had gray  hair, very much tumbled, and wore big spectacles.    \"Hi! hi! boys, what does this mean?\" came in a high-pitched voice.  \"What are you hammering on the house for, when I am just in the  midst of a deep problem concerning the rotation of crops on a  hillside with northern exposure?\"    \"Excuse me, Uncle Randolph, I didn't think to disturb you,\"  answered Tom meekly.  \"I'll put the ball away.\"    \"You never stop to think, Thomas.  Give me that ball.\"    \"Oh, let me keep it, Uncle Randolph!  I won't throw it against the  house again, honor bright.\"    \"You'll forget that promise in ten minutes, Thomas; I know you  well.  Throw the ball up,\" and Mr. Randolph Rover held out his hands.    \"All right, then; here you go,\" answered Tom, somewhat put out to  thus lose a ball which had cost him his week's spending, money;  and he sent the sphere flying upward at a smart speed.  Mr. Rover  made a clutch for it, but the ball slipped through his hands and  landed plump on his nose.    \"Oh!\" he cried, and disappeared from sight, but reappeared a  moment later, to shake his fist at Tom.    \"You young rascal!  You did that on purpose!\" he spluttered, and  brought forth his handkerchief, for his nose had begun to bleed.  \"Was anyone ever tormented so by three boys?\"    \"Now you are in for it again, Tom,\" whispered Sam.    \"I didn't mean to hit you, Uncle Randolph.  Why didn't you catch  it on the fly?\"    \"On the fly?\" repeated the uncle.  \"Do you suppose I am accustomed  to catching cannon balls?\"    \"Didn't you ever play baseball?\"    \"Never.  I spent my time in some useful study.\"  The elderly  gentleman continued to keep his handkerchief to his nose, and  adjusted his glasses.    \"Thank fortune, you are all going to go to boarding school next  week, and we will once more have a little peace and quietness  around Valley Brook!\"    \"Where are we to go, Uncle Randolph?\" asked Sam.    \"You will learn that Monday morning, when you start off.\"    \"It wouldn't hurt to tell us now,\" grumbled Tom.    \"You must learn to be patient, Thomas.  My one hope is that life  at boarding school makes a real man of you.\"    \"Of course we are all to go together?\"    \"Yes, you are to go together, although I can get along with  Richard very well, he is so much more quiet and studious than you  or Samuel.\"    \"I reckon he takes after you, Uncle Randolph.\"    \"If so, he might do worse.  By the way, what were both of you  doing here?\"    \"Nothing,\" came from Sam.    \"We haven't anything to do.  This farm is the slowest place on  earth,\" added Tom.    \"Why do you not study the scientific and agricultural works that I  mentioned to you?  See what I have done for scientific farming.\"    \"I don't want to be a farmer,\" said Tom.  \"I'd rather be a  sailor.\"    \"A sailor!\" gasped Randolph Rover.  \"Of all things!  Why, a sailor  is the merest nobody on earth!\"    \"I guess you mean on the sea, uncle,\" said Sam with a grin.    \"Don't joke me, Samuel.  Yes, Thomas--the calling of a sailor  amounts to absolutely nothing.  Scientific farming is the thing!  Nothing more noble on the face of the earth than to till the  soil.\"    \"I never saw you behind a plow, Uncle Randolph,\" answered Tom,  with a twinkle in his blue eyes.  \"Besides, I heard you say that  the farm ran behind last year.\"    \"Tut, tut, boy!  You know nothing about it.  I made a slight  miscalculation in crops, that was all.  But this year we shall do  better.\"    \"You lost money year before last, too,\" commented Sam.    \"Who told you that?\"    \"Mr. Woddie, the storekeeper at the Corners.\"    \"Mr. Woddie may understand storekeeping, but he knows nothing of  farming, scientific or otherwise.  I spent several thousands of  dollars in experimenting, but the money was not lost.  We shall  soon have grand results.  I shall astonish the whole of New York  State at the next meeting of our agricultural society,\" and Mr.  Randolph Rover waved his hand grandiloquently.  It was easy to see  that scientific farming was his hobby.    \"Randolph!\"  It was the voice of Mrs. Rover, who now appeared  beside her husband.  \"What is the matter with your nose?\"    \"Tom hit me with his ball.  It is all right now, although it did  bleed some.\"    \"The bad boy!  But it is just like him.  Sarah has given notice  that she will leave at the end of her month.  She says she can't  stand the pranks Tom and Sam play on her.\"    \"She need not go--for the boys are going to boarding school, you  know.\"    \"She says you promised to send them off before.\"    \"Well, they shall go this time, rest assured of that.  I cannot  stand their racing up and down stairs, and their noise, any  longer.  They go Monday morning.\"    \"Better send them off tomorrow.\"    \"Well--er--that is rather sudden.\"    \"Sarah's month is up Friday.  She will surely go unless the boys  are out of the house.  And she is the best cook I have ever had.\"    \"Excepting when she burnt the custard pies,\" put in Tom.    \"And when she salted the rice pudding!\" added Sam.    \"Silence, both of you.  Randolph, do send them off.\"    \"Very well, I will.  Boys, you must go away from the house for an  hour or two.\"    \"Can we go fishing or swimming?\" asked Tom.    \"No, I don't want you to go near the river, you may get drowned.\"    \"We can both swim,\" ventured Sam.    \"Never mind--it is not safe--and your poor father left you in  my care.\"    \"Can we go down to the village?\"    \"No, you might get into bad company there.\"    \"Then where shall we go?\" came from both boys simultaneously.    Randolph Rover scratched his head in perplexity.  He had never had  any children of his own, and to manage his brother's offspring was  clearly beyond him.  \"You might go down to the cornfield, and  study the formation of the ears--\"    \"Send them blackberrying,\" suggested Mrs. Rover.  \"We want the  berries for pies tomorrow, and it will give them something to do.\"    \"Very well; boys, you may go blackberrying.  And mind you keep out  of mischief.\"    \"We'll mind,\" answered Tom.  \"But you might let me have that  ball.\"    \"I will give it to you in the morning,\" answered Randolph Rover, and  turned away from the window with his"]]]
