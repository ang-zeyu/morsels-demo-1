THE following pages are a translation of that portion of Professor  Ferri's volume on Criminal Sociology which is immediately  concerned with the practical problems of criminality.  The Report  of the Government committee appointed to inquire into the  treatment of habitual drunkards, the Report of the committee of  inquiry into the best means of identifying habitual criminals, the  revision of the English criminal returns, the Reports of  committees appointed to inquire into the administration of prisons  and the best methods of dealing with habitual offenders, vagrants,  beggars, inebriate and juvenile delinquents, are all evidence of  the fact that the formidable problem of crime is again pressing  its way to the front and demanding re-examination at the hands of  the present generation.  The real dimensions of the question, as  Professor Ferri points out, are partially hidden by the  superficial interpretations which are so often placed upon the  returns relating to crime.  If the population of prisons or  penitentiaries should happen to be declining, this is immediately  interpreted to mean that crime is<p v> <p vi>on the decrease.  And  yet a cursory examination of the facts is sufficient to show that  a decrease in the prison population is merely the result of  shorter sentences and the substitution of fines or other similar  penalties for imprisonment.  If the list of offences for trial  before a judge and jury should exhibit any symptoms of diminution,  this circumstance is immediately seized upon as a proof that the  criminal population is declining, and yet the diminution may  merely arise from the fact that large numbers of cases which used  to be tried before a jury are now dealt with summarily by a  magistrate.  In other words, what we witness is a change of  judicial procedure, but not necessarily a decrease of crime.  Again, when it is pointed out that the number of persons for trial  for indictable offences in England and Wales amounted to 53,044 in  1874-8 and 56,472 in 1889-93, we are at a loss to see what colour  these figures give to the statement that there has been a real and  substantial decrease of crime.  The increase, it is true, may not  be keeping pace with the growth of the general population, but, as  an eminent judge recently stated from the bench, this is to be  accounted for by the fact that the public is every year becoming  more lenient and more unwilling to prosecute.  But an increase of  leniency, however excellent in itself, is not to be confounded  with a decrease of crime.  In the study of social phenomena our  paramount duty is to look at facts and not appearances.    But whether criminality is keeping pace with the growth of  population or not it is a problem of great <p vii>magnitude all  the same, and it will not be solved, as Professor Ferri points  out, by a mere resort to punishments of greater rigour and  severity.  On this matter he is at one with the Scotch  departmental committee appointed to inquire into the best means of  dealing with habitual offenders, vagrants, and juveniles.  As far  as the suppression of vagrancy is concerned the members of the  committee are unanimously of opinion that ``the severest  enactments of the general law are futile, and that the best  results have been obtained by the milder provisions of more recent  statutes.''  They also speak of the ``utter inadequacy of the  present system in all the variety of detail which it offers to  deter the habitual offender from a course of life which devolves  the cost of his maintenance on the prison and the poorhouse when  he is not preying directly on the public.''  The committee state  that they have had testimony from a large number of witnesses  supporting the view that ``long sentences of imprisonment effect  no good result,'' and they arrive at the conclusion that to double  the present sentences would not diminish the number of habitual  offenders.  In this conclusion they are at one with the views of  the Royal Commission on Penal Servitude, which acquiesced in the  objection to the penal servitude system on the ground that it  ``not only fails to reform offenders, but in the case of the less  hardened criminals and especially first offenders produces a  deteriorating effect.''  A similar opinion was recently expressed  by the Prisons Committee presided over by Mr. Herbert Gladstone.  As soon as punishment reaches <p viii>a point at which it makes  men worse than they were before, it becomes useless as an  instrument of reformation or social defence.    The proper method of arriving at a more or less satisfactory  solution of the criminal problem is to inquire into the causes  which are producing the criminal population, and to institute  remedies based upon the results of such an inquiry.  Professor  Ferri's volume has this object in view.  The first chanter, on the  data of Criminal Anthropology, is an inquiry into the individual  conditions which tend to produce criminal habits of mind and  action.  The second chapter, on the data of criminal statistics,  is an examination of the adverse social conditions which tend to  drive certain sections of the population into crime.  It is  Professor Ferri's contention that the volume of crime will not be  materially diminished by codes of criminal law however skilfully  they may be constructed, but by an amelioration of the adverse  individual and social conditions of the community as a whole.  Crime is a product of these adverse conditions, and the only  effective way of grappling with it is to do away as far as  possible with the causes from which it springs.  Although criminal  codes can do comparatively little towards the reduction of crime,  they are absolutely essential for the protection of society.  Accordingly, the last chapter, on Practical Reforms, is intended  to show how criminal law and prison administration may be made  more effective for purposes of social defence.

WILFORD WOODRUFF    THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED        PREFACE.    That which is perhaps best known about Wilford Woodruff is the fact  that he kept throughout his long and eventful life a careful record,  not only of his own life, but of the important affairs in the history  of the Church. In bringing that journal within the compass of one  volume, it has not always been easy to determine what was the most  important for the pages of this biography. All his journals, covering  thousands of pages, I have read with such discriminating judgment as I  could bring to the task. The reader, therefore, need not be reminded  that this biography contains only a small part, the most important part  it is hoped, of the things he wrote.    He was so careful and painstaking, and so completely devoted to the  task of keeping a journal, that his writings have been sought in  compiling much of the important data in Church history which has  already been given to the world. His work, therefore, is not unknown to  those familiar with Church history. Some of his life has been published  in the _Deseret News,_ and _\"Leaves from My Journal\"_ contains  important chapters. Magazines and Church publications have in them  reminiscences which he has given to the readers of those periodicals at  different times.    All missionaries will be interested in the marvelous experiences which  he had while working in the spread of the gospel message. Others will  read with peculiar interest the recital of events in the travels of  the pioneers from the Missouri River to Salt Lake Valley, and others  will read with satisfaction the words that fell from the lips of those  prophets with whom he was immediately associated--Joseph Smith, Brigham  Young, and John Taylor.    The life of Wilford Woodruff was full of marvels. It was a simple life  in which he revealed his heart and his purposes freely. The frankness  of his expressions, his care for details, and his conscientious regard  for the truth made him, perhaps, the best chronicler of events in all  the history of the Church. His journal reveals not so much what he  himself was thinking about the events concerning which he wrote as what  others thought about them. In that respect they reveal wonderfully the  spirit of the times in which he lived.    At the close of the year 1895 in writing of his life, he says: \"For  twenty-one years I was a member of the legislative assembly of the  Territory of Utah.    \"In 1875 I was appointed historian and general recorder of the Church  and held that position until 1889.    \"On the completion of the Temple at St. George in 1877, I was appointed  its President by Brigham Young.    \"Upon the accession of President Taylor, I became President of the  Twelve Apostles; and in April 1889, I was sustained at the general  conference as President of the Church.    \"By my direction the General Church Board of Education was founded  in 1888 to direct the Church system of academies, high schools, and  colleges, which has resulted in a great perfection of the organization.    \"From the beginning of my ministry in 1834 until the close of 1895  I have traveled in all 172,369 miles; held 7,655 meetings; preached  3,526 discourses; organized 51 branches of the Church and 77 preaching  places; my journeys cover England, Scotland, Wales, and 23 states and  5 territories of the Union. My life abounds in incidents which to me  surely indicate the direct interposition of God whom I firmly believe  has guided my every step. On 27 distinct occasions I have been saved  from dangers which threatened my life. I am the father of 17 sons and  16 daughters. I have a posterity of 100 grandchildren and 12 great  grandchildren.\" (At the present time, his grandchildren number at least  145, and his great grandchildren, about 60.)    The hand of God was so abundantly manifested in the life of Wilford  Woodruff, that those who read this book, it is sincerely believed, will  find it both faith-promoting and instructive. The book is given to the  world in the sincerest belief that its pages will greatly add a fresh  interest to the history of the Church, and reveal the subject of this  sketch in such a manner as to make his wonderful labors more highly  appreciated by those not intimately acquainted with him.
