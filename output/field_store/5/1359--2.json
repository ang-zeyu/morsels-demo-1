GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY OF THE LAU LANGUAGE: SOLOMON ISLANDS    BY    WALTER G. IVENS, M. A., LITT. D.    CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON  PUBLICATION NO. 300    PREFACE.    Lau is the name given to the language spoken by the inhabitants of  the artificial islets which lie off the northeast coast of Big  Malaita, Solomon Islands. The language spoken on the coast from Uru  on the northeast to Langalanga, Alite Harbor, on the northwest of  Big Malaita, is practically Lau. On the west coast there is  considerable admixture of Fiu, which is the language of the bush  behind the Langalanga lagoon. In Dr. Codrington's \"Melanesian  Languages,\" pp. 39 et seq., certain words are given as spoken at  Alite in Langalanga.  These words are probably Fiu rather than Lau.    The purest Lau is spoken at Sulufou, one of the artificial islets  near Atta Cove. The inhabitants of Ai-lali, on the mainland of Big  Malaita opposite the island Aio, are an offshoot of the Lau-speaking  peoples.  In Port Adam (Malau) on Little Malaita, some 12 miles  north of Sa'a, there are two villages, Ramarama and Malede,  inhabited by Lau-speaking peoples, and the inhabitants of these  villages hold as a tradition that their forefathers migrated from  Suraina, near Atta Cove, 80 miles away, along the coast to the  north.    The Lau of this grammar and vocabulary was learned from dealings  with the Port Adam natives and also from a stay of several weeks  with Rev.  A. I. Hopkins, at Mangoniia, on the mainland opposite the  artificial islet Ferasubua.    It is not claimed that the Lau here presented is the same as the Lau  of the northeast coast of Big Malaita. Doubtless owing to the Port  Adam peoples being surrounded by Sa'a-speaking peoples, they have  adopted Sa'a words and methods of speech to some extent. The women  of the hill peoples above Port Adam have largely been procured as  wives for the Port Adam men and thus there has been a tendency for  the distinctiveness of the Lau language to disappear and for the  Sa'a words to be adopted. While this tendency was perhaps not very  great previous to the introduction of Christianity (for the village  children always follow the language of the father rather than that  of the mother), the teachers in the village schools, after  Christianity was introduced, necessarily used the Sa'a books and,  when translations were eventually made into Lau, words and phrases  of Sa'a crept in. So far as lay in the power of the present author,  he has endeavored to eliminate these Sa'a elements from the present  work.    In the translations made into Lau, some use has been made of the  gerundive, following the use in Sa'a; but until we have further  evidence of the validity of this usage it must be regarded as not  belonging to the genius of the Lau language, and it is therefore  omitted here.    It will be seen that Lau is a typical Melanesian language and has  few marked peculiarities. In Sa'a there is a distinctive use of the  shortened forms of the pronouns of the first and second persons,  _au_ and _'o_, suffixed to verbs and prepositions as object; in Lau  the same shortening is not effected and the longer forms _nau_,  _oe_, are used.    It has not been thought proper to represent any break in  pronunciation such as occurs in Sa'a in such words, e. g., as _ia_  fish, Sa'a _i'e_.  Lau shows generally the dropping of such  consonants as are dropped in Sa'a, but it is doubtful if the same  break occurs in pronunciation.    The books already printed in Lau are:    1. A translation of the English Prayer Book comprising matins and  evensong, litany, baptism of adults, certain psalms and hymns,  catechism, Holy Communion with Sunday collects.    2. The four Gospels.    The grammar here given is an alteration of the grammar prepared by  the present writer, and printed at Norfolk Island by the Mission  Press in 1914.    W. G. Ivens.

M.L., Codrington's Melanesian Languages.          LAU GRAMMAR.      THE ALPHABET.    The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, with the Italian sounds. All of these  vowels may be long or short, the long sound being represented by a  doubling of the vowel. Closed syllables do not occur, and every word  ends with a vowel. The vowel o in Lau frequently represents a in  Sa'a: _fou_ rock, Sa'a _hau_; _finau_ hook, Sa'a _hinou_; _loulou_  quick, Sa'a _lauleu_.  Where in Sa'a a changes to e in certain words  after a preceding i or u, no such change is made in Lau in the same  words: _ia_ fish, Sa'a _i'e_; _ua_ still, Sa'a _ue_; _i asi_ at sea,  Sa'a i _'esi_.    The diphthongs are ae, ai, ao, eu, ei, ou, as in _sae_, _mai_,  _rao_, _dau_, _mei_, _fou_, pronounced, respectively, as in the  English words eye, iron, hour, how, hey, oh.    The consonants are f, k, g; d, t; b; q, gw; l, r; s; m; mw; n, ng.    The f replaces an h in Sa'a: _fera_ village, Sa'a _hera_ courtyard;  _fuli fera_ village, Sa'a _huli_ bed, _huli nume_ site of house.  The sound represented by f often approximates to v.    Both k and g are hard. The Melanesian g is not heard; as in Sa'a, it  has been dropped in certain words, _ia_ fish, but there is no  noticeable break in the pronunciation. In certain other words this g  is replaced by k: _take_, to stand. Mota _sage_, Sa'a _ta'e_. The g  in Lau may replace a k in Sa'a: _igera_ they, Sa'a _ikire_. A g also  appears in personal pronoun plural 1, excl., where Sa'a has a break:  _igami_ we, Sa'a _i'emi_. A g may also replace an h in Sa'a: _luga_  to loose, Sa'a _luhe_.    There is no preface of n in the sound of d.    In many words a t has been dropped: _angi_ to cry, Oceanic _tangi_;  _asi_ sea, Oceanic _tasi_; _ola_ canoe, Florida _tiola_, Sa'a  _'iola_.    There is no w in Lau. Where it occurs in Sa'a its place is supplied  in Lau by q, the sound of which is kw or ku: _qalu_ eight, Sa'a  _walu_. In Lau the island Ulawa is known as Ulaqa. A q in Lau may  represent an h in Sa'a: _qai_, the reciprocal prefix, is in Sa'a  _hai_. The letter gw may represent a q (pw) in Sa'a: _gwou_ head,  Sa'a _qau_; _gwini_ wet, Sa'a _qini_; _gwou_ deserted, Mota _wou_.  The sound of d is not followed by r, as is the case in Sa'a, nor is  d before i sounded any way differently, as is the case in Sa'a.  Nasal m, i.e., mw, is not so common a sound as it is in Sa'a, but it  is heard in _mwane_ male, _mwela_ child.    There is an interchange between n and l: _nima_ or _lima_ five;  _daluma_ middle, Sa'a _danume_; _inala_ to discern, Sa'a _ilala_.  Both l and r are used and the sounds are distinct; both sounds are  trilled.      ARTICLES.    (a) Demonstrative:  Singular, _na, si; ta, te, ke; maae; fe_.  Plural, _gi; mwai, ote_.    (b) Personal: _a, ni_.    _Na_ denotes a, any, the, and is put to more general use than the  corresponding _nga_ in Sa'a; _na_ is used with both singular and  plural: _na noni_ the body; _na sasigamu_ your brethren. The  conjunction _ma_ (=and) coalesces with _na_; _mana Mwela_ and the  Son. _Na_ is used with the interrogative _taa_ what.    2. _Si_ is more definite and particular in meaning than _na_ and  denotes a part, a piece, any; it is more or less equivalent to  _me'i_ in Sa'a: _si doo ne_ the thing; _gamelu ka ania si taa_ what  are we to eat? _si ere_ a firestick; _si doo gu saea na_ that which  I said; _na_ may be prefixed: _na si baea taa ne_ what words? _si_  can not be used of the plural.    3. _Ta_ means a certain one, every, at all, just, only, and is the  same as the numeral _ta_ one: _ta_ may precede the article _fe_; _ta  fe uo_ every hill, _ni_ may follow _ta_: _tani aiai_ some, other.  _ta_ may mean only: _ta ro ai_ only two people; _ta_ may be used  with the numerals, _ta ro mwane_ two men; _ta ro tangale penny_ 200  pence.    _Te_ has practically the same meanings as _ta_: _te geni sarii_ a  maiden; _te taifilia_ he alone; _te aiai falaete_ one person only.  _Te_ is used of units (as _ata_ in Sa'a), _te fiu fe doo_ only seven  things; _te ai ma te ai_ one by one; _too te ai_ singly. _Si_ may  follow both _ta_ and _te_: _ta si fou_ a certain rock, _te si na  doo_ everything; _te_ may be used as equivalent to the conjunction  and: _te na Mwela_ and the Son.    _Ke_ is used as _te_: _ke si gula iidimani_ a small piece; _ro kesi  kurui bata_ two small pieces of money. _Ke_ and _si_ may be combined  and used with _te_: _e langi asia na teke si doo_ there is nothing  at all.    4. _Maae_ is compounded of _maa_ eye, one, and _e_ the construct  form, and means one, a; _maae_ is used with _fera_ country, _dangi_  day, _rodo_ night, _oru_ wind; _maae"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#1)"],[1,"Fireside Chats of  Franklin Delano Roosevelt    Radio addresses to the American people  broadcast between 1933 and 1944.        March 12, 1933.    I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United  States about banking--with the comparatively few who understand the  mechanics of banking but more particularly with the overwhelming  majority who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing  of checks.  I want to tell you what has been done in the last few  days, why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be.  I  recognize that the many proclamations from state capitols and from  Washington, the legislation, the treasury regulations, etc.,  couched for the most part in banking and legal terms should be  explained for the benefit of the average citizen.  I owe this in  particular because of the fortitude and good temper with which  everybody has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the  banking holiday.  I know that when you understand what we in  Washington have been about I shall continue to have your  cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and help during  the past week.    First of all let me state the simple fact that when you deposit  money in a bank the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit  vault.  It invests your money in many different forms of credit--  bonds, commercial paper, mortgages and many other kinds of loans.  In other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels  of industry and of agriculture turning around.  A comparatively  small part of the money you put into the bank is kept in currency--  an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the  cash needs of the average citizen.  In other words, the total amount  of all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the  total deposits in all of the banks.    What, then, happened during the last few days of February and the  first few days of March?  Because of undermined confidence on the  part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of  our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold--a rush  so great that the soundest banks could not get enough currency to  meet the demand.  The reason for this was that on the spur of the  moment it was, of course, impossible to sell perfectly sound assets  of a bank and convert them into cash except at panic prices far  below their real value.    By the afternoon of March 3d scarcely a bank in the country was  open to do business.  Proclamations temporarily closing them in  whole or in part had been issued by the governors in almost all the  states.    It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the  nation-wide bank holiday, and this was the first step in the  government's reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric.    The second step was the legislation promptly and patriotically  passed by the Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my  powers so that it became possible in view of the requirement of  time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday  gradually.  This law also gave authority to develop a program of  rehabilitation of our banking facilities.  I want to tell our  citizens in every part of the nation that the national Congress--  Republicans and Democrats alike--showed by this action a devotion  to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the  necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in our history.    The third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the  banks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution  of food and household necessities and the payment of payrolls.    This bank holiday, while resulting in many cases in great  inconvenience, is affording us the opportunity to supply the  currency necessary to meet the situation.  No sound bank is a dollar  worse off than it was when it closed its doors last Monday.  Neither  is any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for  immediate opening.  The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve  Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the  banks which reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call.  The  new currency is being sent out by the Bureau of Engraving and  Printing in large volume to every part of the country.  It is sound  currency because it is backed by actual, good assets.    A question you will ask is this:  why are all the banks not to be  reopened at the same time?  The answer is simple.  Your government  does not intend that the history of the past few years shall be  repeated.  We do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank  failures.    As a result, we start tomorrow, Monday, with the opening of banks  in the twelve Federal Reserve Bank cities--those banks which on  first examination by the treasury have already been found to be all  right.  This will be followed on Tuesday by the resumption of all  their functions by banks already found to be sound in cities where  there are recognized clearing houses.  That means about 250 cities  of the United states.    On Wednesday and succeeding days banks in smaller places all  through the country will resume business, subject, of course, to  the government's physical ability to complete its survey.  It is  necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in  order to permit the banks to make applications for necessary loans,  to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements and to enable  the government to make common sense checkups.    Let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the  first day you are by no means justified in believing that it will  not open.  A bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in  exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow.    I know that many people are worrying about state banks not members  of the Federal Reserve System.  These banks can and will receive  assistance from members banks and from the Reconstruction Finance  Corporation.  These state banks are following the same course as the  national banks except that they get their licenses to resume  business from the state authorities, and these authorities have  been asked by the Secretary of the Treasury to permit their good  banks to open up on the same schedule as the national banks.  I am  confident that the state banking departments will be as careful as  the national government in the policy relating to the opening of  banks and will follow the same broad policy.    It is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who  have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals.  Let  me make it clear that the banks will take care of all needs--and it  is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an  exceedingly unfashionable pastime.  It needs no prophet to tell you  that when the people find that they can get their money--that they  can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes--the  phantom of fear will soon be laid.  People will again be glad to  have their money where it will be safely taken care of and where  they can use it conveniently at any time.  I can assure you that it  is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the  mattress.    The success of our whole great national program depends, of course,  upon the cooperation of the public--on its intelligent support and  use of a reliable system.    Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation  is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert  their assets into cash than was the case before.  More liberal  provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the  Reserve Banks and more liberal provision has also been made for  issuing currency on the security of those good assets.  This  currency is not fiat currency.  It is issued only on adequate  security--and every good bank has an abundance of such security.    One more point before I close.  There will be, of course, some banks  unable to reopen without being reorganized.  The new law allows the  government to assist in making these reorganizations quickly and  effectively and even allows the government to subscribe to at least  a part of new capital which may be required.    I hope you can see from this elemental recital of what your  government is doing that there is nothing complex, or radical, in  the process.    We had a bad banking situation.  Some of our bankers had shown  themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the  people's funds.  They had used the money entrusted to them in  speculations and unwise loans.  This was, of course, not true in the  vast majority of our banks, but it was true in enough of them to  shock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put  them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate, but  seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted  them all.  It was the government's job to straighten out this  situation and do it as quickly as possible--and the job is being  performed.    I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that  individual losses will not be suffered, but there will be no losses  that possibly could be avoided; and there would have been more and  greater losses had we continued to drift.  I can even promise you  salvation for some at least of the sorely pressed banks.  We shall  be engaged not merely in reopening sound banks but in the creation  of sound banks through reorganization.    It has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confidence from  all over the country.  I can never be sufficiently grateful to the  people for the loyal support they have given me in their acceptance  of the judgment that has dictated our course, even though all our  processes may not have seemed clear to them.    After all, there is an element in the readjustment of our financial  system more important than currency, more important than gold, and  that is"]]]
