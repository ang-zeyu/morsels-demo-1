Caius Cornelius Tacitus, the Historian, was living under those  Emperors, who reigned from the year 54 to the year 117, of the Christian  era; but the place and the date of his birth are alike uncertain, and  the time of his death is not accurately known. He was a friend of the  younger Pliny, who was born in the year 61; and, it is possible,  they were about the same age. Some of Pliny's letters were written to  Tacitus: the most famous, describes that eruption of Mount Vesuvius,  which caused the death of old Pliny, and overwhelmed the cities of  Pompeii and of Herculaneum. The public life of Tacitus began under  Vespasian; and, therefore, he must have witnessed some part of the reign  of Nero: and we read in him, too, that he was alive after the accession  of the Emperor Trajan. In the year 77, Julius Agricola, then Consul,  betrothed his daughter to Tacitus; and they were married in the  following year. In 88, Tacitus was Praetor; and at the Secular Games of  Domitian, he was one of the _Quindecimviri_: these were sad and solemn  officers, guardians of the Sibylline Verse; and intercessors for the  Roman People, during their grave centenaries of praise and worship.      _Quaeque Aventinum tenet Algidumque,    Quindecim Diana preces virorum    Curet; et vobis pueorum amicas              Applicet aures._    From a passage in \"The Life of Agricola,\" we may believe that Tacitus  attended in the Senate; for he accuses himself as one of that frightened  assembly, which was an unwilling participator in the cruelties of  Domitian. In the year 97, when the Consul Virginius Rufus died, Tacitus'  was made _Consul Suffectus_; and he delivered the funeral oration of his  predecessor: Pliny says, that \"it completed the good fortune of Rufus,  to have his panegyric spoken by so eloquent a man.\" From this, and from  other sayings, we learn that Tacitus was a famous advocate; and his  \"Dialogue about Illustrious Orators\" bears witness to his admirable  taste, and to his practical knowledge of Roman eloquence: of his own  orations, however, not a single fragment has been left. We know not,  whether Tacitus had children; but the Emperor Tacitus, who reigned in  275, traced his genealogy to the Historian. \"If we can prefer personal  merit to accidental greatness,\" Gibbon here observes, \"we shall esteem  the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of Kings. He claimed his  descent from the philosophic historian, whose writings will instruct the  last generations of mankind. From the assiduous study of his immortal  ancestor, he derived his knowledge of the Roman Constitution and of  human nature.\" This Emperor gave orders, that the writings of Tacitus  should be placed in all the public libraries; and that ten copies should  be taken annually, at the public charge. Notwithstanding the Imperial  anxiety, a valuable part of Tacitus is lost: indeed we might argue, from  the solicitude of the Emperor, as well as from his own \"distinction,\"  that Tacitus could not be generally popular; and, in the sixteenth  century, a great portion of him was reduced to the single manuscript,  which lay hidden within a German monastery. Of his literary works, five  remain; some fairly complete, the rest in fragments. Complete, are \"The  Life of Julius Agricola,\" \"The Dialogue on Orators,\" and \"The Account  of Germany\": these are, unfortunately, the minor works of Tacitus. His  larger works are \"The History,\" and \"The Annals.\" \"The History\" extended  from the second Consulship of Galba, in the year 69, to the murder of  Domitian, in the year 96; and Tacitus desired to write the happy times  of Nerva, and of Trajan: we are ignorant, whether infirmity or death  prevented his design. Of \"The History,\" only four books have been  preserved; and they contain the events of a single year: a year, it is  true, which, saw three civil wars, and four Emperors destroyed; a year  of crime, and accidents, and prodigies: there are few sentences more  powerful, than Tacitus' enumeration of these calamities, in the opening  chapters. The fifth book is imperfect; it is of more than common  interest to some people, because Tacitus mentions the siege of Jerusalem  by Titus; though what he says about the Chosen People, here and  elsewhere, cannot be satisfactory to them nor gratifying to their  admirers. With this fragment, about revolts in the provinces of Gaul  and Syria, \"The History\" ends. \"The Annals\" begin with the death of  Augustus, in the year 14; and they were continued until the death of  Nero, in 68. The reign of Tiberius is nearly perfect, though the fall  of Sejanus is missing out of it. The whole of Caligula, the beginning of  Claudius, and the end of Nero, have been destroyed: to those, who know  the style of Tacitus and the lives and genius of Caligula and Nero, the  loss is irreparable; and the admirers of Juvenal must always regret,  that from the hand of Tacitus we have only the closing scene, and not  the golden prime, of Messalina.    The works of Tacitus are too great for a Camelot volume; and, therefore,  I have undertaken a selection of them. I give entire, \"The Account of  Germany\" and \"The Life of Agricola\": these works are entertaining, and  should have a particular interest for English readers. I have added to  them, the greater portion of the first six books of \"The Annals\"; and  I have endeavoured so to guide my choice, that it shall present the  history of Tiberius. In this my volume, the chapters are not numbered:  for the omission, I am not responsible; and I can only lament, what I  may not control. But scholars, who know their Tacitus, will perceive  what I have left out; and to those others, who are not familiar with  him, the omission can be no affront. I would say briefly, that I  have omitted some chapters, which describe criminal events and legal  tragedies in Rome: but of these, I have retained every chapter, which  preserves an action or a saying of Tiberius; and what I have inserted  is a sufficient specimen of the remainder. I have omitted many chapters,  which are occupied with wearisome disputes between the Royal Houses  of Parthia and Armenia: and I have spared my readers the history of  Tacfarinas, an obscure and tedious rebel among the Moors; upon whose  intricate proceedings Tacitus appears to have relied, when he was at a  loss for better material. To reject any part of Tacitus, is a painful  duty; because the whole of him is good and valuable: but I trust, that I  have maintained the unity of my selection, by remembering that it is to  be an history of Tiberius.    Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar, the third master of the Roman world,  derived his origin, by either parent, from the Claudian race; the  proudest family, and one of the most noble and illustrious, in the  ancient Commonwealth: the pages of Livy exhibit the generosity, the  heroism, and the disasters, of the Claudii; who were of unequal fortune  indeed, but always magnificent, in the various events of peace and  war. Suetonius enumerates, among their ancestral honours, twenty-eight  Consulships, five Dictators, seven Censorial commissions, and seven  triumphs: their _cognomen_ of Nero, he says, means in the Sabine tongue  \"vigorous and bold,\" _fortis et strenuus_; and the long history of the  Claudian House does not belie their gallant name. Immediately after the  birth of Tiberius, or perhaps before it, his mother Livia was divorced  from Claudius, and married by Augustus: the Empress is revealed  mysteriously and almost as a divine being, in the progress of \"The  Annals.\" The Emperor adopted the offspring of Claudius: among the  Romans, these legal adoptions were as valid as descent by blood; and  Tiberius was brought up to be the son of Caesar. His natural parts were  improved and strengthened, by the training of the Forum and the camp.  Tiberius became a good orator; and he gained victory and reputation, in  his wars against the savages of Germany and Dalmatia: but his peculiar  talent was for literature; in this, \"he was a great purist, and affected  a wonderful precision about his words.\" He composed some Greek poems,  and a Latin Elegy upon Lucius Caesar: he also wrote an account of his  own life, an _Apologia_; a volume, which the Emperor Domitian was  never tired of reading. But the favourite pursuit of Tiberius was Greek  divinity; like some of the mediaeval Doctors, he frequented the by-ways  of religion, and amused his leisure with the more difficult problems in  theology: \"Who was Hecuba's mother?\" \"What poetry the Sirens chaunted?\"  \"What was Achilles' name, when he lay hid among the women?\" The writings  of Tiberius have all perished; and in these days, we have only too much  cause to regret, that nothing of his \"precision\" has come down to us.

EARLY EUROPEAN HISTORY    BY    HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.                \"There is no part of history so generally useful as that which relates to  the progress of the human mind, the gradual improvement of reason, the  successive advances of science, the vicissitudes of learning and  ignorance, which are the light and darkness of thinking beings, the  extinction and resuscitation of arts, and the revolutions of the  intellectual world.\"    --SAMUEL JOHNSON, _Rasselas_.          PREFACE      This book aims to furnish a concise and connected account of human  progress during ancient, medieval, and early modern times. It should meet  the requirements of those high schools and preparatory schools where  ancient history, as a separate discipline, is being supplanted by a more  extended course introductory to the study of recent times and contemporary  problems. Such a course was first outlined by the Regents of the  University of the State of New York in their _Syllabus for Secondary  Schools_, issued in 1910.    Since the appearance of the Regents' _Syllabus_ the Committee of Five of  the American Historical Association has made its _Report_ (1911),  suggesting a rearrangement of the curriculum which would permit a year's  work in English and Continental history. Still more recently the Committee  on Social Studies of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary  Education, in its _Report_ (1916) to the National Education Association  has definitely recommended the division of European history into two  parts, of which the first should include ancient and Oriental  civilization, English and Continental history to approximately the end of  the seventeenth century, and the period of American exploration.    The first twelve chapters of the present work are based upon the author's  _Ancient History_, published four years ago. In spite of many omissions,  it has been possible to follow without essential modification the plan of  the earlier volume. A number of new maps and illustrations have been added  to these chapters.    The selection of collateral reading, always a difficult problem in the  secondary school, is doubly difficult when so much ground must be covered  in a single course. The author ventures, therefore, to call attention to  his _Readings in Ancient History_. Its purpose, in the words of the  preface, is \"to provide immature pupils with a variety of extended,  unified, and interesting extracts on matters which a textbook treats with  necessary, though none the less deplorable, condensation.\" A companion  volume, entitled _Readings in Medieval and Modern History_, will be  published shortly. References to both books are inserted in footnotes.    At the end of what has been a long and engrossing task, it becomes a  pleasant duty to acknowledge the help which has been received from  teachers in school and college. Various chapters, either in manuscript or  in the proofs, have been read by Professor James M. Leake of Bryn Mawr  College; Professor J. C. Hildt of Smith College; Very Rev. Patrick J.  Healy, Professor of Church History in the Catholic University of America;  Professor E. F. Humphrey of Trinity College; Dr. James Sullivan, Director  of the Division of Archives and History, State Dept. of Education of New  York; Constantine E. McGuire, Assistant Secretary General, International  High Commission, Washington; Miss Margaret E. McGill, of the Newton  (Mass.) High School; and Miss Mabel Chesley, of the Erasmus Hall High  School, Brooklyn. The author would also express appreciation of the labors  of the cartographers, artists, and printers, to whose accuracy and skill  every page of the book bears witness.
