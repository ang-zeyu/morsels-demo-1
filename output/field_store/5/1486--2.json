THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND.    Seventy-five years have passed since Lingard completed his HISTORY OF  ENGLAND, which ends with the Revolution of 1688. During that period  historical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of  materials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have  been thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been  corrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of  our history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost exclusively  to professed historical students. It is believed that the time has come  when the advance which has been made in the knowledge of English history  as a whole should be laid before the public in a single work of fairly  adequate size. Such a book should be founded on independent thought and  research, but should at the same time be written with a full knowledge  of the works of the best modern historians and with a desire to take  advantage of their teaching wherever it appears sound.    The vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a  History of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing  state of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly  advisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an  attempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained  by research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different  writers, each of them chosen as being specially capable of dealing with  the period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each  author as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity  in method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their  contents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History.    As its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,  with the History of England and, after the date of the union with  Scotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of  a nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be  understood without taking into account the various forces acting upon  it, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and  economic progress will also find place in these volumes. The 'footnotes'  will, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,  and references will not be appended to statements which appear to be  matters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume  will have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,  original and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be  compiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long  lists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That the  History will have faults both of its own and such as will always in some  measure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains have  been spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of the  greatness of its subject.    Each volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in  itself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and  will have its own index, and two or more maps.

ON THE SUCCESSFUL ROLLING OF STEEL INGOTS WITH THEIR OWN INITIAL HEAT BY  MEANS OF THE SOAKING PIT PROCESS.    By Mr. JOHN GJERS, Middlesbrough.    [Footnote: Paper read before the Iron and Steel Institute at Vienna.]      When Sir Henry Bessemer, in 1856, made public his great invention, and  announced to the world that he was able to produce malleable steel from  cast iron without the expenditure of any fuel except that which already  existed in the fluid metal imparted to it in the blast furnace, his  statement was received with doubt and surprise. If he at that time had  been able to add that it was also possible to roll such steel into a  finished bar with no further expenditure of fuel, then undoubtedly the  surprise would have been much greater.    Even this, however, has come to pass; and the author of this paper  is now pleased to be able to inform this meeting that it is not only  possible, but that it is extremely easy and practical, by the means to  be described, to roll a steel ingot into, say, a bloom, a rail, or other  finished article with its own initial heat, without the aid of the  hitherto universally adopted heating furnace.    It is well understood that in the fluid steel poured into the mould  there is a larger store of heat than is required for the purpose  of rolling or hammering. Not only is there the mere apparent high  temperature of fluid steel, but there is the store of latent heat in  this fluid metal which is given out when solidification takes place.    It has, no doubt, suggested itself to many that this heat of the ingot  ought to be utilized, and as a matter of fact, there have been, at  various times and in different places, attempts made to do so; but  hitherto all such attempts have proved failures, and a kind of settled  conviction has been established in the steel trade that the theory could  not possibly be carried out in practice.    The difficulty arose from the fact that a steel ingot when newly  stripped is far too hot in the interior for the purpose of rolling, and  if it be kept long enough for the interior to become in a fit state,  then the exterior gets far too cold to enable it to be rolled  successfully. It has been attempted to overcome this difficulty  by putting the hot ingots under shields or hoods, lined with  non-heat-conducting material, and to bury them in non-heat-conducting  material in a pulverized state, for the purpose of retaining and  equalizing the heat; but all these attempts have proved futile in  practice, and the fact remains, that the universal practice in steel  works at the present day all over the world is to employ a heating  furnace of some description requiring fuel.    The author introduced his new mode of treating ingots at the Darlington  Steel and Iron Company's Works, in Darlington, early in June this year,  and they are now blooming the whole of their make, about 125 tons a  shift, or about 300 ingots every twelve hours, by such means.    The machinery at Darlington is not adapted for rolling off in one heat;  nevertheless they have rolled off direct from the ingot treated in the  \"soaking pits\" a considerable number of double-head rails; and the  experience so gained proves conclusively that with proper machinery  there will be no difficulty in doing so regularly. The quality of the  rails so rolled off has been everything that could be desired; and as  many of the defects in rails originate in the heating furnace, the  author ventures to predict that even in this respect the new process  will stand the test.    Many eminently practical men have witnessed the operation at Darlington,  and they one and all have expressed their great surprise at the result,  and at the simple and original means by which it is accomplished.    The process is in course of adoption in several works, both in England  and abroad, and the author hopes that by the time this paper is being  read, there may be some who will from personal experience be able to  testify to the practicability and economy of the process, which is  carried out in the manner now to be described.    A number of upright pits (the number, say, of the ingots in a cast) are  built in a mass of brickwork sunk in the ground below the level of the  floor, such pits in cross-section being made slightly larger than that  of the ingot, just enough to allow for any fins at the bottom, and  somewhat deeper than the longest ingot likely to be used. In practice  the cross section of the pit is made about 3 in. larger than the large  end of the ingot, and the top of the ingot may be anything from 6 in. to  18 in. below the top of the pit. These pits are commanded by an ingot  crane, by preference so placed in relation to the blooming mill that the  crane also commands the live rollers of the mill.    Each pit is covered with a separate lid at the floor level, and after  having been well dried and brought to a red heat by the insertion of hot  ingots, they are ready for operation.    As soon as the ingots are stripped (and they should be stripped as early  as practicable), they are transferred one by one, and placed separately  by means of the crane into these previously heated pits (which the  author calls \"soaking pits\") and forthwith covered over with the lid,  which practically excludes the air. In these pits, thus covered, the  ingots are allowed to stand and soak; that is, the excessive molten  heat of the interior, and any additional heat rendered sensible during  complete solidification, but which was latent at the time of placing  the ingots into the pit, becomes uniformly distributed, or nearly so,  throughout the metallic mass. No, or comparatively little, heat being  able to escape, as the ingot is surrounded by brick walls as hot as  itself, it follows that the surface heat of the ingot is greatly  increased; and after the space of from twenty to thirty minutes,  according to circumstances, the ingot is lifted out of the pit  apparently much hotter than it went in, and is now swung round to the  rolls, by means of the "]]]
