Excellent works of the kind abound in all  civilised countries, and it were useless to attempt another. France  has those of Dadant, Georges de Layens and Bonnier, Bertrand, Hamet,  Weber, Clement, the Abbe Collin, etc. English-speaking countries  have Langstroth, Bevan, Cook, Cheshire, Cowan, Root, etc. Germany  has Dzierzon, Van Berlespoch, Pollmann, Vogel, and many others.    Nor is this book to be a scientific monograph on Apis Mellifica,  Ligustica, Fasciata, Dorsata, etc., or a collection of new  observations and studies. I shall say scarcely anything that those  will not know who are somewhat familiar with bees. The notes and  experiments I have made during my twenty years of beekeeping I shall  reserve for a more technical work; for their interest is necessarily  of a special and limited nature, and I am anxious not to over-burden  this essay. I wish to speak of the bees very simply, as one speaks  of a subject one knows and loves to those who know it not. I do not  intend to adorn the truth, or merit the just reproach Reaumur  addressed to his predecessors in the study of our honey-flies, whom  he accused of substituting for the marvellous reality marvels that  were imaginary and merely plausible. The fact that the hive contains  so much that is wonderful does not warrant our seeking to add to its  wonders. Besides, I myself have now for a long time ceased to look  for anything more beautiful in this world, or more interesting, than  the truth; or at least than the effort one is able to make towards  the truth. I shall state nothing, therefore, that I have not  verified myself, or that is not so fully accepted in the text-books  as to render further verification superfluous. My facts shall be as  accurate as though they appeared in a practical manual or scientific  monograph, but I shall relate them in a somewhat livelier fashion  than such works would allow, shall group them more harmoniously  together, and blend them with freer and more mature reflections. The  reader of this book will not learn therefrom how to manage a hive;  but he will know more or less all that can with any certainty be  known of the curious, profound, and intimate side of its  inhabitants. Nor will this be at the cost of what still remains to  be learned. I shall pass over in silence the hoary traditions that,  in the country and many a book, still constitute the legend of the  hive. Whenever there be doubt, disagreement, hypothesis, when I  arrive at the unknown, I shall declare it loyally; you will find  that we often shall halt before the unknown. Beyond the appreciable  facts of their life we know but little of the bees. And the closer  our acquaintance becomes, the nearer is our ignorance brought to us  of the depths of their real existence; but such ignorance is better  than the other kind, which is unconscious, and satisfied.    Does an analogous work on the bee exist? I believe I have read  almost all that has been written on bees; but of kindred matter I  know only Michelet's chapter at the end of his book \"The Insect,\"  and Ludwig Buchner's essay in his \"Mind in Animals.\" Michelet merely  hovers on the fringe of his subject; Buchner's treatise is  comprehensive enough, but contains so many hazardous statements, so  much long-discarded gossip and hearsay, that I suspect him of never  having left his library, never having set forth himself to question  his heroines, or opened one of the many hundreds of rustling,  wing-lit hives which we must profane before our instinct can be  attuned to their secret, before we can perceive the spirit and  atmosphere, perfume and mystery, of these virgin daughters of toil.  The book smells not of the bee, or its honey; and has the defects of  many a learned work, whose conclusions often are preconceived, and  whose scientific attainment is composed of a vast array of doubtful  anecdotes collected on every side. But in this essay of mine we  rarely shall meet each other; for our starting-point, our aim, and  our point of view are all very different.    {2}    The bibliography of the bee (we will begin with the books so as to  get rid of them as soon as we can and go to the source of the books)  is very extensive. From the beginning this strange little creature,  that lived in a society under complicated laws and executed  prodigious labours in the darkness, attracted the notice of men.  Aristotle, Cato, Varro, Pliny, Columella, Palladius all studied the  bees; to say nothing of Aristomachus, who, according to Cicero,  watched them for fifty-eight years, and of Phyliscus, whose writings  are lost. But these dealt rather with the legend of the bee; and all  that we can gather therefrom--which indeed is exceedingly little--we  may find condensed in the fourth book of Virgil's Georgics.    The real history of the bee begins in the seventeenth century, with  the discoveries of the great Dutch savant Swammerdam. It is well,  however, to add this detail, but little known: before Swammerdam a  Flemish naturalist named Clutius had arrived at certain important  truths, such as the sole maternity of the queen and her possession  of the attributes of both sexes, but he had left these unproved.  Swammerdam founded the true methods of scientific investigation; he  invented the microscope, contrived injections to ward off decay, was  the first to dissect the bees, and by the discovery of the ovaries  and the oviduct definitely fixed the sex of the queen, hitherto  looked upon as a king, and threw the whole political scheme of the  hive into most unexpected light by basing it upon maternity. Finally  he produced woodcuts and engravings so perfect that to this day they  serve to illustrate many books on apiculture. He lived in the  turbulent, restless Amsterdam of those days, regretting \"Het Zoete  Buiten Leve \"--The Sweet Life of the Country--and died, worn-out  with work, at the age of forty-three. He wrote in a pious, formal  style, with beautiful, simple outbursts of a faith that, fearful of  falling away, ascribed all things to the glory of the Creator; and  embodied his observations and studies in his great work \"Bybel der  Natuure,\" which the doctor Boerhave, a century later, caused to be  translated from the Dutch into Latin under the title of \"Biblia  Naturae.\" (Leyden, 1737.)    Then came Reaumur, who, pursuing similar methods, made a vast number  of curious experiments and researches in his gardens at Charenton,  and devoted to the bees an entire volume of his \"Notes to Serve for  a History of Insects.\" One may read it with profit to-day, and  without fatigue. It is clear, direct, and sincere, and possessed of  a certain hard, arid charm of its own. He sought especially the  destruction of ancient errors; he himself was responsible for  several new ones; he partially understood the formation of swarms  and the political establishment of queens; in a word, he discovered  many difficult truths, and paved the way for the discovery of more.  He fully appreciated the marvellous architecture of the hive; and  what he said on the subject has never been better said. It is to  him, too, that we owe the idea of the glass hives, which, having  since been perfected, enable us to follow the entire private life of  these fierce insects, whose work, begun in the dazzling sunshine,  receives its crown in the darkness. To be comprehensive, one should  mention also the somewhat subsequent works and investigations of  Charles Bonnet and Schirach (who solved the enigma of the royal  egg); but I will keep to the broad lines, and pass at once to  Francois Huber, the master and classic of contemporary apiarian  science.    Huber was born in Geneva in 1750, and fell blind in his earliest  youth. The experiments of Reaumur interested him; he sought to  verify them, and soon becoming passionately absorbed in these  researches, eventually, with the assistance of an intelligent and  faithful servant, Francois Burnens, devoted his entire life to the  study of the bee. In the annals of human suffering and human triumph  there is nothing more touching, no lesson more admirable, than the  story of this patient collaboration, wherein the one who saw only  with immaterial light guided with his spirit the eyes and hands of  the other who had the real earthly vision; where he who, as we are  assured, had never with his own eyes beheld a comb of honey, was yet  able, notwithstanding the veil on his dead eyes that rendered double  the veil in which nature enwraps all things, to penetrate the  profound secrets of the genius that had made this invisible comb; as  though to teach us that no condition in life can warrant our  abandoning our desire and search for the truth. I will not enumerate  all that apiarian science owes to Huber; to state what it does not  owe were the briefer task. His \"New Observations on Bees,\" of which  the first volume was written in 1789, in the form of letters to  Charles Bonnet, the second not appearing till twenty years later,  have remained the unfailing, abundant treasure into which every  subsequent writer has dipped. And though a few mistakes may be found  therein, a few incomplete truths; though since his time considerable  additions have been made to the micrography and practical culture of  bees, the handling of queens, etc., there is not a single one of his  principal statements that has been disproved, or discovered in  error; and in our actual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#1)"],[1,"http://mormontextsproject.org/ for a complete list of  Mormon texts available on Project Gutenberg, to help  proofread similar books, or to report typos.              THE HOUSE OF THE LORD    A STUDY OF HOLY SANCTUARIES ANCIENT AND MODERN    INCLUDING FORTY-SIX PLATES ILLUSTRATIVE OF MODERN TEMPLES        By    JAMES E. TALMAGE    One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints        Published by the Church    Salt Lake City, Utah    1912        PREFACE    {iii} Among the numerous sects and churches of the present day, the  Latter-day Saints are distinguished as builders of Temples. In this  respect they resemble Israel of olden time. It is not surprising that  great and widespread interest is manifest respecting this peculiarity  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, nor that questions  are continually arising as to the purpose and motive behind this great  labor, and the nature of the ordinances administered in these modern  Houses of the Lord. To answer some of these questions, and to place  within the reach of earnest inquirers authentic information concerning  the doctrine and practise of Temple ministration, this book has been  written.    By way of affording means of easy comparison between the  Temple-building achievements of past and those of current time, a  brief treatment of the sanctuaries of earlier dispensations has been  included. While detailed information pertaining to ancient Temples and  related sanctuaries is accessible to all, through cyclopedias, Bible  dictionaries and works of more special scope, but little concerning  the Temples of today and the sacred service therein rendered has  been published in separate form. The official \"History of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" contains abundant data on the  subject; but the information is distributed through many tomes, and is  of access to comparatively few.    Among the special publications in this field, most of which are  primarily devoted to the history and description of the Temple at Salt  Lake City, are the following:    {iv} \"Temples: Descriptive and historical sketches of ancient and  modern sacred edifices,\" a pamphlet of 28 pages, by J. M. Sjodahl, Salt  Lake City, 1892. This covers the history of the Salt Lake City Temple  to the time of the laying of the capstone, April, 1892. The pamphlet  contains outline drawings.    \"The Salt Lake Temple,\" an article by James H. Anderson, published in  \"The Contributor,\" Vol. XIV, No. 6, April, 1893, 60 pages with numerous  illustrations of the Temple at different stages, together with details  of construction, and portraits of Church officials and others connected  with the erection of the great structure.    \"Historical and descriptive sketch of the Salt Lake Temple,\" an  illustrated pamphlet of 36 pages published by the Deseret News, Salt  Lake City, April, 1893.    \"A Description of the Great Temple, Salt Lake City, and a statement  concerning the purposes for which it has been built,\" a pamphlet of  40 pages, by D. M. McAllister, Salt Lake City, 1912. This contains  half-tone engravings of both exterior and interior views.    In the present undertaking the author has been the recipient of many  courtesies and much assistance from the officials of the several  Temples, the Church Historian and his assistants, the general  authorities of the Church, and many others. To all who have assisted in  the pleasing labor his obligations are respectfully acknowledged.    The photographs showing interior views of the Salt Lake City Temple are  the work of the C. R. Savage Company, to whom thanks are tendered for  liberal, courteous, and efficient service.    James E. Talmage    Salt Lake City, Utah, September 21, 1912.          CONTENTS      CHAPTER I.

CHAPTER I    A PRE-VIEW OF THE SUBJECT    {1} Both by derivation and common usage the term \"temple,\" in its  literal application, is of restricted and specific meaning. The  essential idea of a temple is and ever has been that of a _place_  specially set apart for service regarded as sacred, and of real or  assumed sanctity; in a more restricted sense, a temple is a _building_  constructed for and exclusively devoted to sacred rites and ceremonies.    The Latin _Templum_ was the equivalent of the Hebrew _Beth Elohim_, and  signified the abode of Deity; hence, as associated with Divine worship,  it meant literally the HOUSE OF THE LORD.[1]    Structures regarded in their entirety as sanctuaries, {2} or enclosing  apartments so designated, have been reared in many different ages, both  by worshippers of idols and by the followers of the true and living  God. Heathen temples of antiquity were regarded as abiding places of  the mythical gods and goddesses whose names they bore, and to whose  service the structures were dedicated. While the purlieus of such  temples were used as places of general assembly and public ceremony,  there were always inner precincts, into which only the consecrated  priests might enter, and wherein, it was claimed, the presence of  the deity was manifest. As evidence of the exclusiveness of ancient  temples, even those of heathen origin, we find that the altar of  pagan worship stood not within the temple proper, but in front of the  entrance. Temples have never been regarded as places of ordinary public  assembly, but as sacred enclosures consecrated to the most solemn  ceremonials of that particular system of worship, idolatrous or Divine,  of which the temple stood as visible symbol and material type.    In olden times the people of Israel were distinguished among nations as  the builders of sanctuaries to the name of the living God. This service  was specifically required of them by Jehovah, whom they professed to  serve. The history of Israel as a nation dates from the exodus. During  the two centuries of their enslavement in Egypt, the children of Jacob  had grown to be a numerous and powerful people; nevertheless they were  in bondage. In due time, however, their sorrows and supplications came  up before the Lord, and He led them forth by the outstretched arm of  power. No sooner had they escaped from the environment of Egyptian  idolatry, than they were required to prepare a sanctuary, wherein  Jehovah {3} would manifest His presence and make known His will as  their accepted Lord and King.    The Tabernacle, which from the time of its construction in the  wilderness and thence onward throughout the period of wandering and for  centuries thereafter, was sacred to Israel as the sanctuary of Jehovah,  had been built according to revealed plan and specifications. It was a  compact and portable structure as the exigencies of migration required.  Though the Tabernacle was but a tent, it was made of the best, the  most prized, and the costliest materials the people possessed. This  condition of excellence was appropriate and fitting, for the finished  structure was a nation's offering unto the Lord. Its construction  was prescribed in minutest detail, both as to design and material;  it was in every respect the best the people could give, and Jehovah  sanctified the proffered gift by His divine acceptance. In passing, let  us be mindful of the fact that whether it be the gift of a man or a  nation, the best, if offered willingly and with pure intent, is always  excellent in the sight of God, however poor by other comparison that  best may be.    To the call for material wherewith to build the Tabernacle, there was  such willing and liberal response that the need was more than met: \"For  the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and  too much.\"[2] Proclamation was made accordingly, and the people were  restrained from bringing more. The artificers and workmen engaged in  the making of the Tabernacle were designated by direct revelation, or  chosen by divinely appointed authority with special reference to their  skill and devotion. The completed Tabernacle, viewed in {4} relation to  its surroundings and considered in connection with the circumstances  of its creation, was an imposing structure. Its frames were of rare  wood, its inner hangings of fine linen and elaborate embroideries with"]]]
