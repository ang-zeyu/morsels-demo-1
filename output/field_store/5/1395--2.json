In the transcription of some words of the Algonquian languages, the     original text of this edition uses a character that resembles an     infinity sign. This is taken from the old system that the Jesuits used     to record these languages, and represents a long, nasalized, unrounded     'o.' It is here represented with an '8.'          CHAMPLAIN'S VOYAGES.    [Illustration: Champlain (Samuel De) d'apres un portrait grave par  Moncornet]    VOYAGES OF SAMUEL DE CHAMPLAIN.    TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH    By CHARLES POMEROY OTIS, Ph.D.    WITH HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS, and a MEMOIR    By the REV. EDMUND F. SLAFTER, A.M.    VOL. I. 1567-1635    FIVE ILLUSTRATIONS.    Editor: The REV EDMUND F SLAFTER, A.M.          PREFACE    The labors and achievements of the navigators and explorers, who visited  our coasts between the last years of the fifteenth and the early years of  the seventeenth centuries, were naturally enough not fully appreciated by  their contemporaries, nor were their relations to the future growth of  European interests and races on this continent comprehended in the age in  which they lived. Numberless events in which they were actors, and personal  characteristics which might have illustrated and enriched their history,  were therefore never placed upon record. In intimate connection with the  career of Cabot, Cartier, Roberval, Ribaut, Laudonniere, Gosnold, Pring,  and Smith, there were vast domains of personal incident and interesting  fact over which the waves of oblivion have passed forever. Nor has  Champlain been more fortunate than the rest. In studying his life and  character, we are constantly finding ourselves longing to know much where  we are permitted to know but little. His early years, the processes of his  education, his home virtues, his filial affection and duty, his social and  domestic habits and mode of life, we know imperfectly; gathering only a few  rays of light here and there in numerous directions, as we follow him along  his lengthened career. The reader will therefore fail to find very much  that he might well desire to know, and that I should have been but too  happy to embody in this work. In the positive absence of knowledge, this  want could only be supplied from the field of pure imagination. To draw  from this source would have been alien both to my judgment and to my taste.    But the essential and important events of Champlain's public career are  happily embalmed in imperishable records. To gather these up and weave them  into an impartial and truthful narrative has been the simple purpose of my  present attempt. If I have succeeded in marshalling the authentic deeds and  purposes of his life into a complete whole, giving to each undertaking and  event its true value and importance, so that the historian may more easily  comprehend the fulness of that life which Champlain consecrated to the  progress of geographical knowledge, to the aggrandizement of France, and to  the dissemination of the Christian faith in the church of which he was a  member, I shall feel that my aim has been fully achieved.    The annotations which accompany Dr. Otis's faithful and scholarly  translation are intended to give to the reader such information as he may  need for a full understanding of the text, and which he could not otherwise  obtain without the inconvenience of troublesome, and, in many instances, of  difficult and perplexing investigations. The sources of my information are  so fully given in connection with the notes that no further reference to  them in this place is required.    In the progress of the work, I have found myself under great obligations to  numerous friends for the loan of rare books, and for valuable suggestions  and assistance. The readiness with which historical scholars and the  custodians of our great depositories of learning have responded to my  inquiries, and the cordiality and courtesy with which they have uniformly  proffered their assistance, have awakened my deepest gratitude. I take this  opportunity to tender my cordial thanks to those who have thus obliged and  aided me. And, while I cannot spread the names of all upon these pages, I  hasten to mention, first of all, my friend, Dr. Otis, with whom I have been  so closely associated, and whose courteous manner and kindly suggestions  have rendered my task always an agreeable one. I desire, likewise, to  mention Mr. George Lamb, of Boston, who has gratuitously executed and  contributed a map, illustrating the explorations of Champlain; Mr. Justin  Winsor, of the Library of Harvard College; Mr. Charles A. Cutter, of the  Boston Athenaeum; Mr. John Ward Dean, of the Library of the New England  Historic Genealogical Society; Mrs. John Carter Brown, of Providence,  R. I.; Miss S. E. Dorr, of Boston; Monsieur L. Delisle, Directeur General  de la Bibliotheque Nationale, of Paris; M. Meschinet De Richemond,  Archiviste de la Charente Inferieure, La Rochelle, France; the Hon. Charles  H. Bell, of Exeter, N. H.; Francis Parkman, LL.D., of Boston; the Abbe H.  R. Casgrain, of Riviere Ouelle, Canada; John G. Shea, LL.D., of New York;  Mr. James M. LeMoine, of Quebec; and Mr. George Prince, of Bath, Maine.    I take this occasion to state for the information of the members of the  Prince Society, that some important facts contained in the Memoir had not  been received when the text and notes of the second volume were ready for  the press, and, to prevent any delay in the completion of the whole work,  Vol. II. was issued before Vol. I., as will appear by the dates on their  respective title-pages.

He was the son of Antoine de Champlain, a  captain in the marine, and his wife Marguerite LeRoy. They lived in the  little village of Brouage, in the ancient province of Saintonge. Of their  son Samuel, no contemporaneous record is known to exist indicating either  the day or year of his birth. The period at which we find him engaged in  active and responsible duties, such as are usually assigned to mature  manhood, leads to the conjecture that he was born about the year 1567. Of  his youth little is known. The forces that contributed to the formation of  his character are mostly to be inferred from the abode of his early years,  the occupations of those by whom he was surrounded, and the temper and  spirit of the times in which he lived.    Brouage is situated in a low, marshy region, on the southern bank of an  inlet or arm of the sea, on the southwestern shores of France, opposite to  that part of the Island of Oleron where it is separated from the mainland  only by a narrow channel. Although this little town can boast a great  antiquity, it never at any time had a large population. It is mentioned by  local historians as early as the middle of the eleventh century. It was a  seigniory of the family of Pons. The village was founded by Jacques de  Pons, after whose proper name it was for a time called Jacopolis, but soon  resumed its ancient appellation of Brouage.    An old chronicler of the sixteenth century informs us that in his time it  was a port of great importance, and the theatre of a large foreign  commerce. Its harbor, capable of receiving large ships, was excellent,  regarded, indeed, as the finest in the kingdom of France. [1] It was a  favorite idea of Charles VIII. to have at all times several war-ships in  this harbor, ready against any sudden invasion of this part of the coast.    At the period of Champlain's boyhood, the village of Brouage had two  absorbing interests. First, it had then recently become a military post of  importance; and second, it was the centre of a large manufacture of salt.  To these two interests, the whole population gave their thoughts, their  energy, and their enterprise.

HISTORY OF KING CHARLES THE SECOND OF ENGLAND.    BY JACOB ABBOTT.          PREFACE.        The author of this series has made it his special object to confine  himself very strictly, even in the most minute details which he records,  to historic truth. The narratives are not tales founded upon history,  but history itself, without any embellishment or any deviations from  the strict truth, so far as it can now be discovered by an attentive  examination of the annals written at the time when the events themselves  occurred. In writing the narratives, the author has endeavored to avail  himself of the best sources of information which this country affords;  and though, of course, there must be in these volumes, as in all  historical accounts, more or less of imperfection and error, there is  no intentional embellishment. Nothing is stated, not even the most  minute and apparently imaginary details, without what was deemed good  historical authority. The readers, therefore, may rely upon the record  as the truth, and nothing but the truth, so far as an honest purpose  and a careful examination have been effectual in ascertaining it.

CONCLUSION          CHAPTER I.    INFANCY.        King Charles the Second was the son and successor of King Charles the  First. These two are the only kings of the name of Charles that have  appeared, thus far, in the line of English sovereigns. Nor is it very  probable that there will soon be another. The reigns of both these  monarchs were stained and tarnished with many vices and crimes, and  darkened by national disasters of every kind, and the name is thus  connected with so many painful associations in the minds of men, that  it seems to have been dropped, by common consent, in all branches of  the royal family.    The reign of Charles the First, as will be seen by the history of his  life in this series, was characterized by a long and obstinate contest  between the king and the people, which brought on, at last, a civil  war, in which the king was defeated and taken prisoner, and in the end  beheaded on a block, before one of his own palaces. During the last  stages of this terrible contest, and before Charles way himself taken  prisoner, he was, as it were, a fugitive and an outlaw in his own  dominions. His wife and family were scattered in various foreign lands,  his cities and castles were in the hands of his enemies, and his oldest  son, the prince Charles, was the object of special hostility. The  prince incurred, therefore, a great many dangers, and suffered many  heavy calamities in his early years. He lived to see these calamities  pass away, and, after they were gone, he enjoyed, so far as his own  personal safety and welfare were concerned, a tranquil and prosperous  life. The storm, however, of trial and suffering which enveloped the  evening of his father's days, darkened the morning of his own. The  life of Charles the First was a river rising gently, from quiet springs,  in a scene of verdure and sunshine, and flowing gradually into rugged  and gloomy regions, where at last it falls into a terrific abyss,  enveloped in darkness and storms. That of Charles the Second, on the  other hand, rising in the wild and rugged mountains where the parent  stream was engulfed, commences its course by leaping frightfully from  precipice to precipice, with turbid and foaming waters, but emerges  at last into a smooth and smiling land, and flows through it  prosperously to the sea.    Prince Charles's mother, the wife of Charles the First, was a French  princess. Her name was Henrietta Maria. She was unaccomplished,  beautiful, and very spirited woman. She was a Catholic, and the English  people, who were very decided in their hostility to the Catholic faith,  were extremely jealous of her. They watched all her movements with the  utmost suspicion. They were very unwilling that an heir to the crown  should arise in her family. The animosity which they felt against her  husband the king, which was becoming every day more and more bitter,  seemed to be doubly inveterate and intense toward her. They published  pamphlets, in which they called her a daughter of Heth, a Canaanite,  and an idolatress, and expressed hopes that from such a worse than  pagan stock no progeny should ever spring.    Henrietta was at this time--1630--twenty-one years of age, and had  been married about four years. She had had one son, who had died a few  days after his birth. Of course, she did not lead a very happy life  in England. Her husband the king, like the majority of the English  people, was a Protestant, and the difference was a far more important  circumstance in those days than it would be now; though even now a  difference in religious faith, on points _which either party deems  essential_, is, in married life, an obstacle to domestic happiness,  which comes to no termination, and admits of no cure. If it were  possible for reason and reflection to control the impetuous impulses  of youthful hearts, such differences of religious faith would be  regarded, where they exist, as an insurmountable objection to a  matrimonial union.    The queen, made thus unhappy by religious dissensions with her husband,  and by the public odium of which she was the object, lived in  considerable retirement and seclusion at St. James's Palace, in  Westminster, which is the western part of London. Here her second son,  the subject of this history, was born, in May, 1630, which was ten  years after the landing of the pilgrims on the Plymouth rock. The babe  was very far from being pretty, though he grew up at last to be quite  a handsome man. King Charles was very much pleased at the birth of his  son. He rode into London the next morning at the head of a long train  of guards and noble attendants, to the great cathedral church of St.  Paul's, to render thanks publicly to God for the birth of his child  and the safety of the queen. While this procession was going through  the streets, all London being out to gaze upon it, the attention of  the vast crowd was attracted to the appearance of a star glimmering  faintly in the sky at midday. This is an occurrence not very uncommon,  though it seldom, perhaps, occurs when it has so many observers to  witness it. The star was doubtless Venus, which, in certain  circumstances, is often bright enough to be seen when the sun is above  the horizon. The populace of London, however, who were not in those  days very profound astronomers, regarded the shining of the star as  a supernatural occurrence altogether, and as portending the future  greatness and glory of the prince whose natal day it thus unexpectedly  adorned.    Preparations were made for the baptism of the young prince in July.  The baptism of a prince is an important affair, and there was one  circumstance which gave a peculiar interest to that of the infant  Charles. The Reformation had not been long established in England, and  this happened to be the first occasion on which an heir to the English  crown had been baptized since the Liturgy of the English Church had  been arranged. There is a chapel connected with the palace of St.  James, as is usual with royal palaces in Europe, and even, in fact,  with the private castles and mansions of the higher nobility. The  baptism took place there. On such occasions it is usual for certain  persons to appear as sponsors, as they are called, who undertake to  answer for the safe and careful instruction of the child in the  principles of the Christian faith. This is, of course, mainly a form,  the real function of the sponsors being confined, as it would appear,  to making magnificent presents to their young godchild, in  acknowledgment of the distinguished honor conferred upon them by their  designation to the office which they hold. The sponsors, on this  occasion, were certain royal personages in France, the relatives of  the queen. They could not appear personally, and so they appointed  proxies from among the higher nobility of England, who appeared at the  baptism in their stead, and made the presents to the child. One of  these proxies was a duchess, whose gift was a jewel valued at a sum  in English money equal to thirty thousand dollars.    The oldest son of a king of England receives the title of Prince of  Wales; and there was an ancient custom of the realm, that an infant  prince of Wales should be under the care, in his earliest years, of  a Welsh nurse, so that the first words which he should learn to speak  might be the vernacular language of his principality. Such a nurse was  provided for Charles. Rockers for his cradle were appointed, and many  other officers of his household, all the arrangements being made in  a very magnificent and sumptuous manner. It is the custom in England  to pay fees to the servants by which a lady or gentleman is attended,  even when a guest in private dwellings; and some idea may be formed  of the scale on which the pageantry of this occasion was conducted,  from the fact that one of the lady sponsors who rode to the palace in  the queen's carriage, which was sent for her on this occasion, paid  a sum equal to fifty dollars each to six running footmen who attended  the carriage, and a hundred dollars to the coachman; while a number  of knights who came on horseback and in armor to attend upon the  carriage, as it moved to the palace, received each a gratuity of two  hundred and fifty dollars.
