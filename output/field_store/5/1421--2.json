G. Wodehouse    1909            PREFACE    It may be thought by some that in the pages which follow I have painted  in too lurid colours the horrors of a foreign invasion of England.  Realism in art, it may be argued, can be carried too far. I prefer to  think that the majority of my readers will acquit me of a desire to be  unduly sensational. It is necessary that England should be roused to a  sense of her peril, and only by setting down without flinching the  probable results of an invasion can this be done. This story, I may  mention, has been written and published purely from a feeling of  patriotism and duty. Mr. Alston Rivers' sensitive soul will be jarred  to its foundations if it is a financial success. So will mine. But in a  time of national danger we feel that the risk must be taken. After all,  at the worst, it is a small sacrifice to make for our country.    P. G. WODEHOUSE.    _The Bomb-Proof Shelter,_ _London, W._            Part One          Chapter 1    AN ENGLISH BOY'S HOME      _August the First, 19--_    Clarence Chugwater looked around him with a frown, and gritted his  teeth.    \"England--my England!\" he moaned.    Clarence was a sturdy lad of some fourteen summers. He was neatly, but  not gaudily, dressed in a flat-brimmed hat, a coloured handkerchief, a  flannel shirt, a bunch of ribbons, a haversack, football shorts, brown  boots, a whistle, and a hockey-stick. He was, in fact, one of General  Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts.    Scan him closely. Do not dismiss him with a passing glance; for you are  looking at the Boy of Destiny, at Clarence MacAndrew Chugwater, who  saved England.    To-day those features are familiar to all. Everyone has seen the  Chugwater Column in Aldwych, the equestrian statue in Chugwater Road  (formerly Piccadilly), and the picture-postcards in the stationers'  windows. That bulging forehead, distended with useful information; that  massive chin; those eyes, gleaming behind their spectacles; that  _tout ensemble_; that _je ne sais quoi_.    In a word, Clarence!    He could do everything that the Boy Scout must learn to do. He could  low like a bull. He could gurgle like a wood-pigeon. He could imitate  the cry of the turnip in order to deceive rabbits. He could smile and  whistle simultaneously in accordance with Rule 8 (and only those who  have tried this know how difficult it is). He could spoor, fell trees,  tell the character from the boot-sole, and fling the squaler. He did  all these things well, but what he was really best at was flinging the  squaler.           *       *       *       *       *    Clarence, on this sultry August afternoon, was tensely occupied  tracking the family cat across the dining-room carpet by its  foot-prints. Glancing up for a moment, he caught sight of the other  members of the family.    \"England, my England!\" he moaned.    It was indeed a sight to extract tears of blood from any Boy Scout. The  table had been moved back against the wall, and in the cleared space  Mr. Chugwater, whose duty it was to have set an example to his  children, was playing diabolo. Beside him, engrossed in cup-and-ball,  was his wife. Reggie Chugwater, the eldest son, the heir, the hope of  the house, was reading the cricket news in an early edition of the  evening paper. Horace, his brother, was playing pop-in-taw with his  sister Grace and Grace's _fiance_, Ralph Peabody. Alice, the other  Miss Chugwater, was mending a Badminton racquet.    Not a single member of that family was practising with the rifle, or  drilling, or learning to make bandages.    Clarence groaned.    \"If you can't play without snorting like that, my boy,\" said Mr.  Chugwater, a little irritably, \"you must find some other game. You made  me jump just as I was going to beat my record.\"    \"Talking of records,\" said Reggie, \"Fry's on his way to his eighth  successive century. If he goes on like this, Lancashire will win the  championship.\"    \"I thought he was playing for Somerset,\" said Horace.    \"That was a fortnight ago. You ought to keep up to date in an important  subject like cricket.\"    Once more Clarence snorted bitterly.    \"I'm sure you ought not to be down on the floor, Clarence,\" said Mr.  Chugwater anxiously. \"It is so draughty, and you have evidently got a  nasty cold. _Must_ you lie on the floor?\"    \"I am spooring,\" said Clarence with simple dignity.    \"But I'm sure you can spoor better sitting on a chair with a nice  book.\"    \"_I_ think the kid's sickening for something,\" put in Horace  critically. \"He's deuced roopy. What's up, Clarry?\"    \"I was thinking,\" said Clarence, \"of my country--of England.\"    \"What's the matter with England?\"    \"_She's_ all right,\" murmured Ralph Peabody.    \"My fallen country!\" sighed Clarence, a not unmanly tear bedewing the  glasses of his spectacles. \"My fallen, stricken country!\"    \"That kid,\" said Reggie, laying down his paper, \"is talking right  through his hat. My dear old son, are you aware that England has never  been so strong all round as she is now? Do you _ever_ read the  papers? Don't you know that we've got the Ashes and the Golf  Championship, and the Wibbley-wob Championship, and the Spiropole,  Spillikins, Puff-Feather, and Animal Grab Championships? Has it come to  your notice that our croquet pair beat America last Thursday by eight  hoops? Did you happen to hear that we won the Hop-skip-and-jump at the  last Olympic Games? You've been out in the woods, old sport.\"    Clarence's heart was too full for words. He rose in silence, and  quitted the room.    \"Got the pip or something!\" said Reggie. \"Rum kid! I say, Hirst's  bowling well! Five for twenty-three so far!\"    Clarence wandered moodily out of the house. The Chugwaters lived in a  desirable villa residence, which Mr. Chugwater had built in Essex. It  was a typical Englishman's Home. Its name was Nasturtium Villa.    As Clarence walked down the road, the excited voice of a newspaper-boy  came to him. Presently the boy turned the corner, shouting, \"Ker-lapse  of Surrey! Sensational bowling at the Oval!\"    He stopped on seeing Clarence.    \"Paper, General?\"    Clarence shook his head. Then he uttered a startled exclamation, for  his eye had fallen on the poster.    It ran as follows:--        SURREY      DOING      BADLY      GERMAN ARMY LANDS IN ENGLAND          Chapter 2    THE INVADERS      Clarence flung the boy a halfpenny, tore a paper from his grasp, and  scanned it eagerly. There was nothing to interest him in the body of  the journal, but he found what he was looking for in the stop-press  space. \"Stop press news,\" said the paper. \"Fry not out, 104. Surrey 147  for 8. A German army landed in Essex this afternoon. Loamshire  Handicap: Spring Chicken, 1; Salome, 2; Yip-i-addy, 3. Seven ran.\"    Essex! Then at any moment the foe might be at their doors; more, inside  their doors. With a passionate cry, Clarence tore back to the house.    He entered the dining-room with the speed of a highly-trained Marathon  winner, just in time once more to prevent Mr. Chugwater lowering his  record.    \"The Germans!\" shouted Clarence. \"We are invaded!\"    This time Mr. Chugwater was really annoyed.    \"If I have told you once about your detestable habit of shouting in the  house, Clarence, I have told you a hundred times. If you cannot be a  Boy Scout quietly, you must stop being one altogether. I had got up to  six that time.\"    \"But, father----\"    \"Silence! You will go to bed this minute; and I shall consider the  question whether you are to have any supper. It will depend largely on  your behaviour between now and then. Go!\"    \"But, father----\"    Clarence dropped the paper, shaken with emotion. Mr. Chugwater's  sternness deepened visibly.    \"Clarence! Must I speak again?\"    He stooped and removed his right slipper.    Clarence withdrew.    Reggie picked up the paper.    \"That kid,\" he announced judicially, \"is off his nut! Hullo! I told you  so! Fry not out, 104. Good old Charles!\"    \"I say,\" exclaimed Horace, who sat nearest the window, \"there are two  rummy-looking chaps coming to the front door, wearing a sort of fancy  dress!\"    \"It must be the Germans,\" said Reggie. \"The paper says they landed here  this afternoon. I expect----\"    A thunderous knock rang through the house. The family looked at one  another. Voices were heard in the hall, and next moment the door opened  and the servant announced \"Mr. Prinsotto and Mr. Aydycong.\"    \"Or, rather,\" said the first of the two newcomers, a tall, bearded,  soldierly man, in perfect English, \"Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig and  Captain the Graf von Poppenheim, his aide-de-camp.\"    \"Just so--just so!\" said Mr. Chugwater, affably. \"Sit down, won't you?\"    The visitors seated themselves. There was an awkward silence.    \"Warm day!\" said Mr. Chugwater.    \"Very!\" said the Prince, a little constrainedly.    \"Perhaps a cup of tea? Have you come far?\"    \"Well--er--pretty far. That is to say, a certain distance. In fact,  from Germany.\"    \"I spent my summer holiday last year at Dresden. Capital place!\"    \"Just so. The fact is, Mr.--er--\"    \"Chugwater. By the way--my wife, Mrs. Chugwater.\"    The prince bowed. So did his aide-de-camp.    \"The fact is, Mr. Jugwater,\" resumed the prince, \"we are not here on a  holiday.\"    \"Quite so, quite so. Business before pleasure.\"    The prince pulled at his moustache. So did his aide-de-camp, who seemed  to be a man of but little initiative and conversational resource.    \"We are invaders.\"    \"Not at all, not at all,\" protested Mr. Chugwater.    \"I must warn you that you will resist at your peril. You wear no  uniform--\"    \"Wouldn't dream of such a thing. Except at the lodge, of course.\"    \"You will be sorely tempted, no doubt. Do not think that I do not  appreciate your feelings. This is an Englishman's Home.\"    Mr. Chugwater tapped him confidentially on the knee.    \"And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#1)"],[1,"AMATEUR CRACKSMAN      BY    E.

The scene of my disaster was much as I had left it.  The baccarat-counters still strewed the table, with the empty glasses  and the loaded ash-trays.  A window had been opened to let the smoke  out, and was letting in the fog instead.  Raffles himself had merely  discarded his dining jacket for one of his innumerable blazers.  Yet he  arched his eyebrows as though I had dragged him from his bed.    \"Forgotten something?\" said he, when he saw me on his mat.    \"No,\" said I, pushing past him without ceremony.  And I led the way  into his room with an impudence amazing to myself.    \"Not come back for your revenge, have you?  Because I'm afraid I can't  give it to you single-handed.  I was sorry myself that the others--\"    We were face to face by his fireside, and I cut him short.    \"Raffles,\" said I, \"you may well be surprised at my coming back in this  way and at this hour.  I hardly know you.  I was never in your rooms  before to-night.  But I fagged for you at school, and you said you  remembered me.  Of course that's no excuse; but will you listen to  me--for two minutes?\"    In my emotion I had at first to struggle for every word; but his face  reassured me as I went on, and I was not mistaken in its expression.    \"Certainly, my dear man,\" said he; \"as many minutes as you like.  Have  a Sullivan and sit down.\"  And he handed me his silver cigarette-case.    \"No,\" said I, finding a full voice as I shook my head; \"no, I won't  smoke, and I won't sit down, thank you.  Nor will you ask me to do  either when you've heard what I have to say.\"    \"Really?\" said he, lighting his own cigarette with one clear blue eye  upon me.  \"How do you know?\"    \"Because you'll probably show me the door,\" I cried bitterly; \"and you  will be justified in doing it!  But it's no use beating about the bush.  You know I dropped over two hundred just now?\"    He nodded.    \"I hadn't the money in my pocket.\"    \"I remember.\"    \"But I had my check-book, and I wrote each of you a check at that desk.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Not one of them was worth the paper it was written on, Raffles.  I am  overdrawn already at my bank!\"    \"Surely only for the moment?\"    \"No.  I have spent everything.\"    \"But somebody told me you were so well off. I heard you had come in for  money?\"    \"So I did.  Three years ago.  It has been my curse; now it's all  gone--every penny!  Yes, I've been a fool; there never was nor will be  such a fool as I've been....  Isn't this enough for you?  Why don't you  turn me out?\"  He was walking up and down with a very long face instead.    \"Couldn't your people do anything?\" he asked at length.    \"Thank God,\" I cried, \"I have no people!  I was an only child.  I came  in for everything there was.  My one comfort is that they're gone, and  will never know.\"    I cast myself into a chair and hid my face. Raffles continued to pace  the rich carpet that was of a piece with everything else in his rooms.  There was no variation in his soft and even footfalls.    \"You used to be a literary little cuss,\" he said at length; \"didn't you  edit the mag. before you left?  Anyway I recollect fagging you to do my  verses; and literature of all sorts is the very thing nowadays; any  fool can make a living at it.\"    I shook my head.  \"Any fool couldn't write off my debts,\" said I.    \"Then you have a flat somewhere?\" he went on.    \"Yes, in Mount Street.\"    \"Well, what about the furniture?\"    I laughed aloud in my misery.  \"There's been a bill of sale on every  stick for months!\"    And at that Raffles stood still, with raised eyebrows and stern eyes  that I could meet the better now that he knew the worst; then, with a  shrug, he resumed his walk, and for some minutes neither of us spoke.  But in his handsome, unmoved face I read my fate and death-warrant; and  with every breath I cursed my folly and my cowardice in coming to him  at all.  Because he had been kind to me at school, when he was captain  of the eleven, and I his fag, I had dared to look for kindness from him  now; because I was ruined, and he rich enough to play cricket all the  summer, and do nothing for the rest of the year, I had fatuously  counted on his mercy, his sympathy, his help!  Yes, I had relied on him  in my heart, for all my outward diffidence and humility; and I was  rightly served.  There was as little of mercy as of sympathy in that  curling nostril, that rigid jaw, that cold blue eye which never glanced  my way.  I caught up my hat.  I blundered to my feet.  I would have  gone without a word; but Raffles stood between me and the door.    \"Where are you going?\" said he.    \"That's my business,\" I replied.  \"I won't trouble YOU any more.\"    \"Then how am I to help you?\"    \"I didn't ask your help.\"    \"Then why come to me?\"    \"Why, indeed!\" I echoed.  \"Will you let me pass?\"    \"Not until you tell me where you are going and what you mean to do.\"    \"Can't you guess?\" I cried.  And for many seconds we stood staring in  each other's eyes.    \"Have you got the pluck?\" said he, breaking the spell in a tone so  cynical that it brought my last drop of blood to the boil.    \"You shall see,\" said I, as I stepped back and whipped the pistol from  my overcoat pocket. \"Now, will you let me pass or shall I do it here?\"    The barrel touched my temple, and my thumb the trigger.  Mad with  excitement as I was, ruined, dishonored, and now finally determined to  make an end of my misspent life, my only surprise to this day is that I  did not do so then and there. The despicable satisfaction of involving  another in one's destruction added its miserable appeal to my baser  egoism; and had fear or horror flown to my companion's face, I shudder  to think I might have died diabolically happy with that look for my  last impious consolation.  It was the look that came instead which held  my hand.  Neither fear nor horror were in it; only wonder, admiration,  and such a measure of pleased expectancy as caused me after all to  pocket my revolver with an oath.    \"You devil!\" I said.  \"I believe you wanted me to do it!\"    \"Not quite,\" was the reply, made with a little start, and a change of  color that came too late. \"To tell you the truth, though, I half  thought you meant it, and I was never more fascinated in my life.  I  never dreamt you had such stuff in you, Bunny!  No, I'm hanged if I let  you go now.  And you'd better not try that game again, for you won't  catch me stand and look on a second time.  We must think of some way  out of the mess.  I had no idea you were a chap of that sort!  There,  let me have the gun.\"    One of his hands fell kindly on my shoulder, while the other slipped  into my overcoat pocket, and I suffered him to deprive me of my weapon  without a murmur.  Nor was this simply because Raffles had the subtle  power of making himself irresistible at will.  He was beyond comparison  the most masterful man whom I have ever known; yet my acquiescence was  due to more than the mere subjection of the weaker nature to the  stronger. The forlorn hope which had brought me to the Albany was  turned as by magic into an almost staggering sense of safety.  Raffles  would help me after all!  A. J. Raffles would be my friend!  It was as  though all the world had come round suddenly to my side; so far  therefore from resisting his action, I caught and clasped his hand with  a fervor as uncontrollable as the frenzy which had preceded it.    \"God bless you!\" I cried.  \"Forgive me for everything.  I will tell you  the truth.  I DID think you might help me in my extremity, though I  well knew that I had no claim upon you.  Still--for the old school's  sake--the sake of old times--I thought you might give me another  chance.  If you wouldn't I meant to blow out my brains--and will still  if you change your mind!\"    In truth I feared that it was changing, with his expression, even as I  spoke, and in spite of his kindly tone and kindlier use of my old  school nickname.  His next words showed me my mistake.    \"What a boy it is for jumping to conclusions! I have my vices, Bunny,  but backing and filling is not one of them.  Sit down, my good fellow,  and have a cigarette to soothe your nerves.  I insist.  Whiskey?  The  worst thing for you; here's some coffee that I was brewing when you  came in.  Now listen to me.  You speak of 'another chance.'  What do  you mean?  Another chance at baccarat?  Not if I know it!  You think  the luck must turn; suppose it didn't?  We should only have made bad  worse.  No, my dear chap, you've plunged enough. Do you put yourself in  my hands or do you not? Very well, then you plunge no more, and I  undertake not to present my check.  Unfortunately there are the other  men; and still more unfortunately, Bunny, I'm as hard up at this moment  as you are yourself!\"    It was my turn to stare at Raffles.  \"You?\" I vociferated.  \"You hard  up?  How am I to sit here and believe that?\"    \"Did I refuse to believe it of you?\" he returned, smiling.  \"And, with  your own experience, do you think that because a fellow has rooms in  this place, and belongs to a club or two, and plays a little cricket,  he must necessarily have a balance at the bank?  I tell you, my dear  man, that at this moment I'm as hard up as you ever were.  I have  nothing but my wits to live on--absolutely nothing else. It was as  necessary for me to win some money this evening as it was for you.  We're in the same boat, Bunny; we'd better pull together.\"    \"Together!\"  I jumped at it.  \"I'll do anything in this world for you,  Raffles,\" I said, \"if "]]]
