Roberts,    Author of \"The Gospel,\" \"Outlines of Ecclesiastical History,\" \"Mormon  Doctrine of Deity,\" \"Defense of the Faith and the Saints,\" \"The  Prophet-Teacher,\" etc., etc.    * * * *    IN THREE VOLUMES    VOL. II.    * * * *    THE DESERET NEWS    Salt Lake City    1909        PREFACE.    The following work was begun twenty-two years ago, in England, when  the author was in that land on a Mission, as assistant Editor of the  _Latter-day Saints' Millennial Star_. It was the author's design then  to make the treatise on the Book of Mormon the first volume under  the general title \"New Witnesses for God\"; but after some progress  in collecting and arranging the materials had been made, the thought  occurred to him that the Prophet Joseph Smith in chronological order,  if not in importance, preceded the Book of Mormon in the introduction  of God's Witnesses in this last and great dispensation. The materials  of this work, therefore, so far as they had been collected, were laid  aside and work was begun on the treatise of Joseph Smith as a Witness  for God; which, however, because of many other demands upon the  author's time, was not published until 1895.    Meantime work was continued from time to time upon the treatise of the  Book of Mormon; and in 1903-4-5, the materials were used, substantially  as in their present form, as Manuals for the Senior Classes of the  Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations. The work has undergone a  thorough revision at the hands of the author, and is now to take the  place in his writings designed for it so long ago.    While the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is but an incident in  God's great work of the last days, and the book itself subordinate to  some other facts in that work, still the incident of its coming forth  and the book are facts of such importance that the whole work of God  may be said, in a manner, to stand or fall with them. That is to say,  if the origin of the Book of Mormon could be proved to be other than  that set forth by Joseph Smith; if the book itself could be proved to  be other than it claims to be, _viz_., and chiefly, an abridged history  of the ancient inhabitants of America, a volume of scripture containing  a message from God to the people to whom it was written--\"to the  Lamanites [American Indians], who are a remnant of the house of Israel;  and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of commandment, and also by  the spirit of prophecy and revelation\"--if, I say, the Book of Mormon  could be proved to be other than this, then the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, and its message and doctrines, which, in some  respects, may be said to have arisen out of the Book of Mormon, must  fall; for if that book is other than it claims to be; if its origin is  other than that ascribed to it by Joseph Smith, then Joseph Smith says  that which is untrue; he is a false prophet of false prophets; and all  he taught, and all his claims to inspiration and divine authority, are  not only vain but wicked; and all that he did as a religious teacher is  not only useless, but mischievous beyond human comprehending.    Nor does this statement of the case set forth sufficiently strong the  situation. Those who accept the Book of Mormon for what it claims to  be, may not so state their case that its security chiefly rests on the  inability of its opponents to prove a negative. The affirmative side  of the question belongs to us who hold out the Book of Mormon to the  world as a revelation from God. The burden of proof rests upon us in  every discussion. It is not enough for us to say that if the origin of  the Book of Mormon is proved to be other than that set forth by Joseph  Smith; if the book itself be proved to be other than it claims to be,  then the institution known as \"Mormonism\" must fall. We must do more  than rest our case on the inability of opponents to prove a negative.  The security of \"Mormonism\" rests on quite other grounds; and, from a  forensic standpoint, upon much more precarious ground; for not only  must the Book of Mormon not be proved to have other origin than that  which we set forth, or be other than what we say it is, _but we must  prove its origin to be what we say it is, and the book itself to be  what we proclaim it to be--a revelation from God_.    From these remarks the reader will observe, I trust, that while I refer  to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon as an incident, and the book  itself as a fact subordinate to some other facts connected with the  great work of God in the last days, I have by no means underrated the  importance of the Book of Mormon in its relation to God's work of the  last days as a whole. It is to meet the requirements of this situation  that I have been anxious to add my contribution to the gradually  accumulating literature on this subject, both within and without the  Church, both upon the affirmative and the negative side of the question.    My treatise is divided into four parts:    I.--The Value of the Book of Mormon as a Witness for the Authenticity  and Integrity of the Bible; and the Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    II.--The Discovery of the Book of Mormon and its Translation,  Migrations, Lands, Intercontinental Movements, Civilizations,  Governments, and the Religions of its Peoples.    III.--Evidences of the Truth of the Book of Mormon.    IV.--Objections to the Book of Mormon Considered.    It will be seen from the titles of these divisions that Parts I and II  are really only preparatory in their nature. The more interesting field  of evidence and argument is not entered until Part III is reached.  But Parts I and II, if not so intensely interesting as the divisions  devoted to argument, they are, nevertheless, every whit as important.  It goes without saying that the success of an argument greatly, and I  may say fundamentally, depends upon the clearness and completeness of  the statement of the matter involved; and it is frequently the case  that a proper setting forth of a subject makes its truth self-evident;  and all other evidence becomes merely collateral, and all argument  becomes of secondary importance. Especially is this the case when  setting forth the Book of Mormon for the world's acceptance; in which  matter we have the right to expect, and the assurance in the book  itself that we shall receive, the co-operation of divine agencies to  confirm to the souls of men the truth of the Nephite record; that as  that record was written in the first instance by divine commandment,  by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation; and as it was preserved  by angelic guardianship, and at last brought forth by revelation, and  translated by what men regard as miraculous means, so it is provided  in God's providences, respecting this volume of scripture, that its  truth shall be attested to individuals by the operations of the Holy  Spirit upon the human mind. \"When ye shall receive these things,\"  says the prophet Moroni, referring to the writings of the Nephites,  \"I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the  name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with  a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will  manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And  by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\"    This must ever be the chief source of evidence for the truth of the  Book of Mormon. All other evidence is secondary to this, the primary  and infallible. No arrangement of evidence, however skilfully ordered;  no argument, however adroitly made, can ever take its place; for this  witness of the Holy Spirit to the souls of men for the truth of the  Nephite volume of scripture, is God's evidence to the truth; and will  ever be the chief reliance of those who accept the Book of Mormon, and  expect to see its acceptance extended throughout the world; for, as the  heavens are higher than the earth, so must the testimony of God forever  stand above and before the testimony of men, and of things.    I confess that these reflections have a saddening effect upon one who  undertakes to set forth what he must confess are but the secondary  evidences to the truth of the Book of Mormon, and make an argument  that he can never regard as of primary importance in the matter of  convincing the world of the truth of the work in the interest of which  he labors. But I trust these reflections will help my readers to a  right apprehension of the importance of Parts I and II, the importance  of a clear and, so far as may be, a complete statement of the incidents  connected with the coming forth of the book, and also of its contents.  To be known, the truth must be stated, and the clearer and more  complete the statement is, the better opportunity will the Holy Spirit  have for testifying to the souls of men that the work is true. While  desiring to make it clear that our chief reliance for evidence to  the truth of the Book of Mormon must ever be the witness of the Holy  Spirit, promised by the prophet Moroni to those who will seek to know  the truth from that source; and desiring, also, as I think is becoming  in man, to acknowledge the superiority of God's witness to the truth  as compared with any evidence that man may set forth--I would not  have it thought that the evidence and argument presented in Parts III  and IV are unimportant. Secondary evidences in support of truth, like  secondary causes in natural phenomena, may be of firstrate importance,  and mighty factors in the achievement of God's purposes. I only desire  by these remarks to place the matters to be considered in their right  relations.    B. H. ROBERTS.    Salt Lake City, March, 1909.        TABLE OF CONTENTS.    PART I.

ROBERTSON SMITH.        P R E F A C E.      The work which forms the greater part of the present volume first  appeared in 1878 under the title \"History of Israel.  By J.  Wellhausen.  In two volumes.  Volume I.\"  The book produced a great  impression throughout Europe, and its main thesis, that \"the Mosaic  history is not the starting-point for the history of ancient  Israel, but for the history of Judaism,\" was felt to be so  powerfully maintained that many of the leading Hebrew teachers of  Germany who had till then stood aloof from the so-called \"Grafian  hypothesis\"--the doctrine, that is, that the Levitical Law and  connected parts of the Pentateuch were not written till after the  fall of the kingdom of Judah, and that the Pentateuch in its  present compass was not publicly accepted as authoritative till  the reformation of Ezra--declared themselves convinced by  Wellhausen's arguments.  Before 1878 the Grafian hypothesis was  neglected or treated as a paradox in most German universities,  although some individual scholars of great name were known to have  reached by independent inquiry similar views to those for which  Graf was the recognised sponsor, and although in Holland the  writings of Professor Kuenen, who has been aptly termed Graf's  goel, had shown in an admirable and conclusive manner that the  objections usually taken to Graf's arguments did not touch the  substance of the thesis for which he contended.   Since 1878, partly through the growing influence of Kuenen, but  mainly through the impression produced by Wellhausen's book, all  this has been changed.  Almost every younger scholar of mark is on  the side of Vatke and Reuss, Lagarde and Graf, Kuenen and  Wellhausen, and the renewed interest in Old Testament study which  is making itself felt throughout all the schools of Europe must be  traced almost entirely to the stimulus derived from a new view of  the history of the Law which sets all Old Testament problems in a  new light.    Our author, who since 1878 had been largely engaged in the study  of other parts of Semitic antiquity, has not yet given to the world  his promised second volume.  But the first volume was a complete  book in itself; the plan was to reserve the whole narrative of the  history of Israel for vol.ii., so that vol.i. was entirely  occupied in laying the critical foundations on which alone a real  history of the Hebrew nation could be built.  Accordingly, the  second edition of the History, vol.i., appeared in 1883 (Berlin,  Reimer), under the new title of \"Prolegomena to the History of  Israel.\"  In this form it is professedly, as it really was before,  a complete and self-contained work; and this is the form of which  a translation, carefully revised by the author, is now offered to  the public.    All English readers interested in the Old Testament will certainly  be grateful to the translators and publishers for a volume which in  its German garb has already produced so profound an impression on  the scholarship of Europe; and even in this country the author's  name is too well known to make it necessary to introduce him at  length to a new public.  But the title of the book has a somewhat  unfamiliar sound to English ears, and may be apt to suggest a  series of dry and learned dissertations meant only for Hebrew  scholars.  It is worth while therefore to point out in a few words  that this would be quite a false impression; that the matters with  which Professor Wellhausen deals are such as no intelligent student  of the Old Testament can afford to neglect; and that the present  volume gives the English reader, for the first time, an  opportunity to form his own judgment on questions which are within  the scope of any one who reads the English Bible carefully and is  able to think clearly, and without prejudice, about its contents.  The history of Israel is part of the history of the faith by  which we live, the New Testament cannot be rightly understood  without understanding the Old, and the main reason why so many  parts of the Old Testament are practically a sealed book even to  thoughtful people is simply that they have not the historical key  to the interpretation of that wonderful literature.    The Old Testament does not furnish a history of Israel, though it  supplies the materials from which such a history can be  constructed. For example, the narrative of Kings gives but the  merest outline of the events that preceded the fall of Samaria; to  understand the inner history of thc time we must fill up this  outline with the aid of the prophets Amos and Hosea.  But the more  the Old Testament has been studied, the more plain has it become  that for many parts of the history something more is needed than  merely to read each part of the narrative books in connection with  the other books that illustrate the same period.  The Historical  Books and the Pentateuch are themselves very composite structures,  in which old narratives occur imbedded in later compilations, and  groups of old laws are overlaid by ordinances of comparatively  recent date.  Now, to take one point only, but that the most  important, it must plainly make a vast difference to our whole  view of the providential course of Israel's history if it appear  that instead of the whole Pentateuchal law having been given to  Israel before the tribes crossed the Jordan, that law really grew  up little by little from its Mosaic germ, and did not attain its  present form till the Israelites were the captives or the subjects  of a foreign power.  This is what the new school of Pentateuch  criticism undertakes to prove, and it does so in a way that should  interest every one.  For in the course of the argument it appears  that the plain natural sense of the old history has constantly  been distorted by the false presuppositions with which we have  been accustomed to approach it--that having a false idea of the  legal and religious culture of the Hebrews when they first entered  Canaan, we continually miss the point of the most interesting  parts of the subsequent story, and above all fail to understand the  great work accomplished by the prophets in destroying Old Israel  and preparing the way first for Judaism and then for the Gospel.  These surely are inquiries which no conscientious student of the  Bible can afford to ignore.    The process of disentangling the twisted skein of tradition is  necessarily a very delicate and complicated one, and involves  certain operations for which special scholarship is indispensable.  Historical criticism is a comparatively modern science, and in its  application to this, as to other histories, it has made many false  and uncertain steps.  But in this, as in other sciences, when the  truth has been reached it can generally be presented in a  comparatively simple form, and the main positions can be justified  even to the general reader by methods much less complicated, and  much more lucid, than those originally followed by the  investigators themselves.  The modern view as to the age of the  Pentateuchal law, which is the key to the right understanding of  the History of Israel, has been reached by a mass of  investigations and discussions of which no satisfactory general  account has ever been laid before the English reader.  Indeed, even  on the Continent, where the subject has been much more studied than  among us, Professor Wellhausen's book was the first complete and  sustained argument which took up the question in all its  historical bearings.    More recently Professor Kuenen of Leyden, whose discussions of  the more complicated questions of Pentateuch analysis are perhaps  the finest things that modern criticism can show, has brought out  the second edition of the first volume of his Onderzoek, and when  this appears in English, as it is soon to do, our Hebrew students  will have in their hands an admirable manual of what I may call  the anatomy of the Pentateuch, in which they can follow from  chapter to chapter the process by which the Pentateuch grew to its  present form.  But for the mass of Bible-readers such detailed  analysis will always be too difficult.  What every one can  understand and ought to try to master, is the broad historical  aspect of the matter.  And this the present volume sets forth in a  way that must be full of interest to every one who has tasted the  intense pleasure of following institutions and ideas in their  growth, and who has faith enough to see the hand of God as clearly  in a long providential development as in a sudden miracle.    The reader will find that every part of the \"Prolegomena\" is  instinct with historical interest, and contributes something to a  vivid realisation of what Old Israel really was, and why it has  so great a part in the history of spiritual faith.  In the first  essay of the Prolegomena a complete picture is given of the  history of the ordinances of worship in Israel, and the  sacrifices, the feasts, the priesthood, are all set in a fresh  light.  The second essay, the history of what the Israelites  themselves believed and recorded about their past, will perhaps to  some readers seem less inviting, and may perhaps best be read  after perusal of the article, reprinted from the \"Encyclopaedia  Britannica\","]]]
