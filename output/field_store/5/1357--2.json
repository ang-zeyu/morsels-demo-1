They lived with their Mother in a  sand-bank, underneath the root of a  very big fir-tree.    \"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs.  Rabbit one morning, \"you may go into  the fields or down the lane, but don't  go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your  Father had an accident there; he was  put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"    \"Now run along, and don't get into  mischief. I am going out.\"      Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket  and her umbrella, and went through  the wood to the baker's. She bought a  loaf of brown bread and five currant  buns.    Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who  were good little bunnies, went down  the lane to gather blackberries;    But Peter, who was very naughty,  ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's  garden, and squeezed under the gate!      First he ate some lettuces and some  French beans; and then he ate some  radishes;    And then, feeling rather sick, he  went to look for some parsley.    But round the end of a cucumber  frame, whom should he meet but Mr.  McGregor!      Mr. McGregor was on his hands  and knees planting out young  cabbages, but he jumped up and ran  after Peter, waving a rake and calling  out, \"Stop thief.\"    Peter was most dreadfully  frightened; he rushed all over the  garden, for he had forgotten the way  back to the gate.    He lost one of his shoes among the  cabbages, and the other shoe  amongst the potatoes.    After losing them, he ran on four  legs and went faster, so that I think he  might have got away altogether if he  had not unfortunately run into a  gooseberry net, and got caught by the  large buttons on his jacket. It was a  blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.      Peter gave himself up for lost, and  shed big tears; but his sobs were  overheard by some friendly sparrows,  who flew to him in great excitement,  and implored him to exert himself.    Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve,  which he intended to pop upon the  top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out  just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.    And rushed into the toolshed, and  jumped into a can. It would have been  a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had  not had so much water in it.      Mr. McGregor was quite sure that  Peter was somewhere in the toolshed,  perhaps hidden underneath a flower-  pot. He began to turn them over  carefully, looking under each.    Presently Peter sneezed--  \"Kertyschoo!\" Mr. McGregor was after  him in no time,    And tried to put his foot upon  Peter, who jumped out of a window,  upsetting three plants. The window  was too small for Mr. McGregor, and  he was tired of running after Peter. He  went back to his work.    Peter sat down to rest; he was out  of breath and trembling with fright,  and he had not the least idea which  way to go. Also he was very damp  with sitting in that can.    After a time he began to wander  about, going lippity--lippity--not  very fast, and looking all around.      He found a door in a wall; but it  was locked, and there was no room  for a fat little rabbit to squeeze  underneath.    An old mouse was running in and  out over the stone doorstep, carrying  peas and beans to her family in the  wood. Peter asked her the way to the  gate, but she had such a large pea in  her mouth that she could not answer.  She only shook her head at him. Peter  began to cry.    Then he tried to find his way  straight across the garden, but he  became more and more puzzled.  Presently, he came to a pond where  Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A  white cat was staring at some  goldfish; she sat very, very still, but  now and then the tip of her tail  twitched as if it were alive. Peter  thought it best to go away without  speaking to her; he has heard about  cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.      He went back towards the toolshed,  but suddenly, quite close to him,  he heard the noise of a hoe--  scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.  Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.  But presently, as nothing happened, he  came out, and climbed upon a  wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The  first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor  hoeing onions. His back was turned  towards Peter, and beyond him was  the gate!    Peter got down very quietly off the  wheelbarrow, and started running as  fast as he could go, along a straight  walk behind some black-currant bushes.    Mr. McGregor caught sight of him  at the corner, but Peter did not care.  He slipped underneath the gate, and  was safe at last in the wood outside  the garden.    Mr. McGregor hung up the little  jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow  to frighten the blackbirds.      Peter never stopped running or  looked behind him till he got home to  the big fir-tree.    He was so tired that he flopped  down upon the nice soft sand on the  floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his  eyes. His mother was busy cooking;  she wondered what he had done with  his clothes. It was the second little  jacket and pair of shoes that Peter  had lost in a fortnight!    I am sorry to say that Peter was not  very well during the evening.    His mother put him to bed, and  made some camomile tea; and she  gave a dose of it to Peter!    \"One table-spoonful to be taken at  bed-time.\"    But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail  had bread and milk and blackberries  for supper.        THE TAILOR OF  GLOUCESTER    \"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass;  And entertain a score or two of tailors.\"  [Richard III]    My Dear Freda:    Because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, I  have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that  nobody has read before.    And the queerest thing about it is--that I heard it in  Gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the  tailor, the waistcoat, and the                 \"No more twist!\"  _Christmas_      In the time of swords and peri wigs  and full-skirted coats with flowered  lappets--when gentlemen wore  ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of  paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a  tailor in Gloucester.    He sat in the window of a little  shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged  on a table from morning till dark.    All day long while the light lasted  he sewed and snippetted, piecing out  his satin, and pompadour, and  lutestring; stuffs had strange names,  and were very expensive in the days of  the Tailor of Gloucester.    But although he sewed fine silk for  his neighbours, he himself was very,  very poor. He cut his coats without  waste; according to his embroidered  cloth, they were very small ends and  snippets that lay about upon the  table--\"Too narrow breadths for  nought--except waistcoats for mice,\"  said the tailor.    One bitter cold day near  Christmastime the tailor began to  make a coat (a coat of cherry-  coloured corded silk embroidered  with pansies and roses) and a cream-  coloured satin waistcoat for the  Mayor of Gloucester.      The tailor worked and worked, and  he talked to himself: \"No breadth at  all, and cut on the cross; it is no  breadth at all; tippets for mice and  ribbons for mobs! for mice!\" said the  Tailor of Gloucester.    When the snow-flakes came down  against the small leaded window-  panes and shut out the light, the tailor  had done his day's work; all the silk  and satin lay cut out upon the table.    There were twelve pieces for the  coat and four pieces for the waistcoat;  and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs  and buttons, all in order. For the  lining of the coat there was fine  yellow taffeta, and for the button-  holes of the waistcoat there was  cherry-coloured twist. And everything  was ready to sew together in the  morning, all measured and  sufficient--except that there was  wanting just one single skein of  cherry-coloured twisted silk.    The tailor came out of his shop at  dark. No one lived there at nights but  little brown mice, and THEY ran in and  out without any keys!      For behind the wooden wainscots  of all the old houses in Gloucester,  there are little mouse staircases and  secret trap-doors; and the mice run  from house to house through those  long, narrow passages.    But the tailor came out of his shop  and shuffled home through the snow.  And although it was not a big house,  the tailor was so poor he only rented  the kitchen.    He lived alone with his cat; it was  called Simpkin.    \"Miaw?\" said the cat when the  tailor opened the door, \"miaw?\"    The tailor replied: \"Simpkin, we  shall make our fortune, but I am  worn to a ravelling. Take this groat  (which is our last fourpence), and,  Simpkin, take a china pipkin, but a  penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of  milk, and a penn'orth of sausages.  And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny  of our fourpence but me one  penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But  do not lose the last penny of the  fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone  and worn to a thread-paper, for I  have NO MORE TWIST.\"      Then Simpkin again said \"Miaw!\"  and took the groat and the pipkin,  and went out into the dark.    The tailor was very tired and  beginning to be ill. He sat down by the  hearth and talked to himself about  that wonderful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#1)"],[1,"AND DARE    or    A BRAVE BOY'S FIGHT FOR FORTUNE    By Horatio Alger, Jr.      NEW YORK          CHAPTER I. THE POST OFFICE AT WAYNEBORO.      \"If we could only keep the post office, mother, we should be all right,\"  said Herbert Carr, as he and his mother sat together in the little  sitting room of the plain cottage which the two had occupied ever since  he was a boy of five.    \"Yes, Herbert, but I am afraid there won't be much chance of it.\"    \"Who would want to take it from you, mother?\"    \"Men are selfish, Herbert, and there is no office, however small, that  is not sought after.\"    \"What was the income last year?\" inquired Herbert.    Mrs. Carr referred to a blank book lying on the table in which the  post-office accounts were kept, and answered:    \"Three hundred and ninety-eight dollars and fifty cents.\"    \"I shouldn't think that would be much of an inducement to an able-bodied  man, who could work at any business.\"    \"Your father was glad to have it.\"    \"Yes, mother, but he had lost an arm in the war, and could not engage in  any business that required both hands.\"    \"That is true, Herbert, but I am afraid there will be more than one who  will be willing to relieve me of the duties. Old Mrs. Allen called at  the office to-day, and told me she understood that there was a movement  on foot to have Ebenezer Graham appointed.\"    \"Squire Walsingham's nephew?\"    \"Yes; it is understood that the squire will throw his influence into the  scale, and that will probably decide the matter.\"    \"Then it's very mean of Squire Walsingham,\" said Herbert, indignantly.  \"He knows that you depend on the office for a living.\"    \"Most men are selfish, my dear Herbert.\"    \"But he was an old schoolfellow of father's, and it was as his  substitute that father went to the war where he was wounded.\"    \"True, Herbert, but I am afraid that consideration won't weigh much with  John Walsingham.\"    \"I have a great mind to go and see him, mother. Have you any  objections?\"    \"I have no objections, but I am afraid it will do no good.\"    \"Mr. Graham ought to be ashamed, with the profits of his store, to want  the post office also. His store alone pays him handsomely.\"    \"Mr. Graham is fond of money. He means to be a rich man.\"    \"That is true enough. He is about the meanest man in town.\"    A few words are needed in explanation, though the conversation explains  itself pretty well.    Herbert's father, returning from the war with the loss of an arm, was  fortunate enough to receive the appointment of postmaster, and thus  earn a small, but, with strict economy, adequate income, until a fever  terminated his earthly career at middle age. Mr. Graham was a rival  applicant for the office, but Mr. Carr's services in the war were  thought to give him superior claims, and he secured it. During the month  that had elapsed since his death, Mrs. Carr had carried on the post  office under a temporary appointment. She was a woman of good business  capacity, and already familiar with the duties of the office, having  assisted her husband, especially during his sickness, when nearly the  whole work devolved upon her. Most of the village people were in favor  of having her retained, but the local influence of Squire Walsingham and  his nephew was so great that a petition in favor of the latter secured  numerous signatures, and was already on file at the department in  Washington, and backed by the congressman of the district, who was  a political friend of the squire. Mrs. Carr was not aware that the  movement for her displacement had gone so far.    It was already nine o'clock when Herbert's conversation with his mother  ended, and he resolved to defer his call upon Squire Walsingham till the  next morning.    About nine o'clock in the forenoon our young hero rang the bell of  the village magnate, and with but little delay was ushered into his  presence.    Squire Walsingham was a tall, portly man of fifty, sleek and evidently  on excellent terms with himself. Indeed, he was but five years older  than his nephew, Ebenezer Graham, and looked the younger of the two,  despite the relationship. If he had been a United States Senator he  could not have been more dignified in his deportment, or esteemed  himself of greater consequence. He was a selfish man, but he was free  from the mean traits that characterized his nephew.    \"You are the Carr boy,\" said the squire, pompously, looking over his  spectacles at Herbert, as he entered the door.    \"My name is Herbert Carr,\" said Herbert, shortly. \"You have known me all  my life.\"    \"Certainly,\" said the squire, a little ruffled at the failure of his  grand manner to impose upon his young visitor. \"Did I not call you the  Carr boy?\"    Herbert did not fancy being called the Carr boy, but he was there to ask  a favor, and he thought it prudent not to show his dissatisfaction. He  resolved to come to the point at once.    \"I have called, Squire Walsingham,\" he commenced, \"to ask if you will  use your influence to have my mother retained in charge of the post  office.\"    \"Ahem!\" said the squire, somewhat embarrassed. \"I am not in charge of  the post-office department.\"    \"No, sir, I am aware of that; but the postmaster general will be  influenced by the recommendations of people in the village.\"    \"Very true!\" said the squire, complacently. \"Very true, and very proper.  I do not pretend to say that my recommendation would not weigh with the  authorities at Washington. Indeed, the member from our district is a  personal friend of mine.\"    \"You know how we are situated,\" continued Herbert, who thought it best  to state his case as briefly as possible. \"Father was unable to save  anything, and we have no money ahead. If mother can keep the post  office, we shall get along nicely, but if she loses it, we shall have a  hard time.\"    \"I am surprised that in your father's long tenure of office he did not  save something,\" said the squire, in a tone which indicated not only  surprise but reproof.    \"There was not much chance to save on a salary of four hundred dollars a  year,\" said Herbert, soberly, \"after supporting a family of three.\"    \"Ahem!\" said the squire, sagely; \"where there's a will there's a way.  Improvidence is the great fault of the lower classes.\"    \"We don't belong to the lower classes,\" said Herbert, flushing with  indignation.    Squire Walmsgham was secretly ambitious of representing his district  some day in Congress, and he felt that he had made a mistake. It won't  do for an aspirant to office to speak of the lower classes, and the  squire hastened to repair his error.    \"That was not the term I intended to imply,\" he condescended to explain.  \"I meant to say that improvidence is the prevailing fault of those whose  income is small.\"    \"We haven't had much chance to be improvident!\" said Herbert \"We have  had to spend all our income, but we are not in debt--that is, we have no  debts that we are unable to pay.\"    \"That is well,\" said Squire Walsingham, \"but, my young constituent--I  mean my young friend--I apprehend that you do not take a right view  of public office. It is not designed to support a privileged class in  luxury.\"    \"Luxury, on four hundred a year!\" replied Herbert.    \"I am speaking in general terms,\" said the squire, hastily. \"I mean to  say that I cannot recommend a person to office simply because he or she  needs the income.\"    \"No, sir, I know that; but my mother understands the duties of the  office, and no complaint has been made that she does not make a good  postmaster.\"    \"Possibly,\" said the squire, non-commitally; \"but I am opposed upon  principle to conferring offices upon women. Men are more efficient, and  better qualified to discharge responsible duties.\"    \"Then, sir,\" said Herbert, his heart sinking, \"I am to understand that  you do not favor the appointment of my mother?\"    \"I should be glad to hear that your mother was doing well,\" said the  squire, \"but I cannot conscientiously favor the appointment of a woman  to be postmaster of Wayneboro.\"    \"That means that he prefers the appointment should go to his nephew,\"  thought Herbert.    \"If my mother were not competent to discharge the duties,\" he said, his  face showing his disappointment in spite of himself, \"I would not ask  your influence, notwithstanding you were a schoolmate of father's, and  he lost his arm while acting as your substitute.\"    \"I have already said that I wish your mother well,\" said the squire,  coloring, \"and in any other way I am ready to help her and you. Indeed,  I may be able to secure you a situation.\"    \"Where, sir?\"    \"Mr. Graham needs a boy in his store, and I think he will take you on my  recommendation.\"    \"Is Tom Tripp going away?\" asked Herbert.    \"The Tripp boy is unsatisfactory, so Mr. Graham tells me.\"    Herbert knew something of what it would be to be employed by Mr. Graham.  Tom Tripp worked early and late for a dollar and a half per week,  without board, for a hard and suspicious taskmaster, who was continually  finding fault with him. But for sheer necessity, he would have left  Mr. Graham's store long ago. He had confided the unpleasantness of  his position to Herbert more than once, and enlisted his sympathy and  indignation. Herbert felt that he would not like to work for Mr. Graham  at any price, more especially as it seemed likely that the storekeeper  was likely to deprive his mother of her office and income.    \"I should not like to work for Mr. Graham, sir,\" he said.    \"It appears to me that you are very particular, young man,\" said Squire  Walsingham.    \"I would be willing to work for you, sir, but not for him.\"    \"Ahem!\" said the squire, somewhat mollified, \"I will think of your  case.\"    Herbert left the house, feeling that his mother's removal was only a  matter of time.          CHAPTER II. HERBERT'S CHANCE.        Herbert left the house of Squire Walsingham in a sober frame of mind. He  saw clearly that his "]]]
