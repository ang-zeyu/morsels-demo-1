But, though the gardeners were many  and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits,  not even grass or shady trees.    The King was in despair about it, when a wise old man said to him:    \"Your gardeners do not understand their business: but what can you  expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters? How should  they have learned to cultivate your garden?\"    \"You are quite right,\" cried the King.    \"Therefore,\" continued the old man, \"you should send for a gardener  whose father and grandfather have been gardeners before him, and very  soon your garden will be full of green grass and gay flowers, and you  will enjoy its delicious fruit.\"    So the King sent messengers to every town, village, and hamlet in his  dominions, to look for a gardener whose forefathers had been gardeners  also, and after forty days one was found.    \"Come with us and be gardener to the King,\" they said to him.    \"How can I go to the King,\" said the gardener, \"a poor wretch like me?\"    \"That is of no consequence,\" they answered. \"Here are new clothes for  you and your family.\"    \"But I owe money to several people.\"    \"We will pay your debts,\" they said.    So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded, and went away with  the messengers, taking his wife and his son with him; and the King,  delighted to have found a real gardener, entrusted him with the care  of his garden. The man found no difficulty in making the royal garden  produce flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year the park was not  like the same place, and the King showered gifts upon his new servant.    The gardener, as you have heard already, had a son, who was a very  handsome young man, with most agreeable manners, and every day he  carried the best fruit of the garden to the King, and all the prettiest  flowers to his daughter. Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and  was just sixteen years old, and the King was beginning to think it was  time that she should be married.    \"My dear child,\" said he, \"you are of an age to take a husband,  therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the son of my prime minister.    \"Father,\" replied the Princess, \"I will never marry the son of the  minister.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the King.    \"Because I love the gardener's son,\" answered the Princess.    On hearing this the King was at first very angry, and then he wept and  sighed, and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter;  but the young Princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry  the gardener's son.    Then the King consulted his ministers. \"This is what you must do,\" they  said. \"To get rid of the gardener you must send both suitors to a  very distant country, and the one who returns first shall marry your  daughter.\"    The King followed this advice, and the minister's son was presented with  a splendid horse and a purse full of gold pieces, while the gardener's  son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of copper money, and  every one thought he would never come back from his journey.    The day before they started the Princess met her lover and said to him:    \"Be brave, and remember always that I love you. Take this purse full of  jewels and make the best use you can of them for love of me, and come  back quickly and demand my hand.\"    The two suitors left the town together, but the minister's son went off  at a gallop on his good horse, and very soon was lost to sight behind  the most distant hills. He traveled on for some days, and presently  reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a  stone.    \"Good-day to you, young traveler,\" said she.    But the minister's son made no reply.    \"Have pity upon me, traveler,\" she said again. \"I am dying of hunger,  as you see, and three days have I been here and no one has given me  anything.\"    \"Let me alone, old witch,\" cried the young man; \"I can do nothing for  you,\" and so saying he went on his way.    That same evening the gardener's son rode up to the fountain upon his  lame gray horse.    \"Good-day to you, young traveler,\" said the beggar-woman.    \"Good-day, good woman,\" answered he.    \"Young traveler, have pity upon me.\"    \"Take my purse, good woman,\" said he, \"and mount behind me, for your  legs can't be very strong.\"    The old woman didn't wait to be asked twice, but mounted behind him,  and in this style they reached the chief city of a powerful kingdom. The  minister's son was lodged in a grand inn, the gardener's son and the old  woman dismounted at the inn for beggars.    The next day the gardener's son heard a great noise in the street, and  the King's heralds passed, blowing all kinds of instruments, and crying:    \"The King, our master, is old and infirm. He will give a great reward to  whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of his youth.\"    Then the old beggar-woman said to her benefactor:    \"This is what you must do to obtain the reward which the King promises.  Go out of the town by the south gate, and there you will find three  little dogs of different colors; the first will be white, the second  black, the third red. You must kill them and then burn them separately,  and gather up the ashes. Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own  color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out, 'A celebrated  physician has come from Janina in Albania. He alone can cure the King  and give him back the strength of his youth.' The King's physicians will  say, This is an impostor, and not a learned man,' and they will make all  sorts of difficulties, but you will overcome them all at last, and will  present yourself before the sick King. You must then demand as much wood  as three mules can carry, and a great cauldron, and must shut yourself  up in a room with the Sultan, and when the cauldron boils you must throw  him into it, and there leave him until his flesh is completely separated  from his bones. Then arrange the bones in their proper places, and throw  over them the ashes out of the three bags. The King will come back to  life, and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old. For your  reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant  you everything you desire. Go, my son, and do not forget any of my  instructions.\"    The young man followed the old beggar-woman's directions. On going out  of the town he found the white, red, and black dogs, and killed and  burnt them, gathering the ashes in three bags. Then he ran to the palace  and cried:    \"A celebrated physician has just come from Janina in Albania. He alone  can cure the King and give him back the strength of his youth.\"    The King's physicians at first laughed at the unknown wayfarer, but the  Sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted. They brought the  cauldron and the loads of wood, and very soon the King was boiling away.  Toward mid-day the gardener's son arranged the bones in their places,  and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old King  revived, to find himself once more young and hearty.    \"How can I reward you, my benefactor?\" he cried. \"Will you take half my  treasures?\"    \"No,\" said the gardener's son.    \"My daughter's hand?\"    \"_No_.\"    \"Take half my kingdom.\"    \"No. Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything  I wish for.\"    \"Alas!\" said the King, \"I set great store by that marvelous ring;  nevertheless, you shall have it.\" And he gave it to him.    The gardener's son went back to say good-by to the old beggar-woman;  then he said to the bronze ring:    \"Prepare a splendid ship in which I may continue my journey. Let the  hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver, the sails of brocade; let  the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance, dressed like  kings. St. Nicholas will be at the helm. As to the cargo, let it be  diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and carbuncles.\"    And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every  particular the description given by the gardener's son, and, stepping  on board, he continued his journey. Presently he arrived at a great town  and established himself in a wonderful palace. After several days he  met his rival, the minister's son, who had spent all his money and was  reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish.  The gardener's son said to him:    \"What is your name, what is your family, and from what country do you  come?\"    \"I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation, and yet see what  a degrading occupation I am reduced to.\"    \"Listen to me; though I don't know anything more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#1)"],[1,"(http://mormontextsproject.org)                THE RISE AND FALL OF NAUVOO.

Once in an ancient city, * * *    Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice    Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,    And in its right hand a sword, as an emblem that justice presided    Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and the homes of the people.    But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;    Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty--    Ruled with an iron rod.--_Evangeline_.    QUEEN ANNE'S war was brought to a close by the treaty of Utrecht, in  1713. By this treaty the French province, Nova Scotia, was ceded by  France to England; and, of course, the inhabitants, nearly exclusively  French, and numbering some three thousand, became subjects of Great  Britain. Less than half a century later, when the French and Indian  war broke out, the French population had increased to eighteen  thousand--outnumbering the English three to one. In fact the presence  of the English amounted to nothing more than a military occupation of  the peninsula. These French peasants, usually called Acadians, had  brought under cultivation large tracts of land; owned about sixty  thousand head of cattle; had built neat cottage homes, established  peaceful hamlets, and lived in a state of plenty, but great simplicity.  They were reputed to be a peaceable, industrious, and amiable race;  governed mostly by their pastors, who exercised a paternal authority  over them.      Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers--    Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from    Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.    Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;    But their dwellings were open as day, and the hearts of their owners;    There the richest were poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.    When the French and Indian war broke out, these people were quietly  cultivating their farms, and manifested no warlike disposition. Still,  the deputy governor of the province, Lawrence by name, pretended to  fear an insurrection, should the French in Canada attempt an invasion  of Acadia. Therefore when General Braddock met in council with the  colonial governors at Alexandria, Lawrence urged the assembly to do  something to overawe the French, and strengthen the English authority.  A plan to humiliate the Acadians was decided upon, and placed in the  hands of the infamous deputy governor, Lawrence, and Colonel Monckton  to execute.    A fleet of forty vessels with three thousand regular troops on board,  left Boston in May, 1755, and after a successful voyage anchored in  Chignecto Bay. Landing their troops, they besieged Fort Beau-Sejour,  which had been erected by the French, on the isthmus connecting  Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. After a feeble resistance the fort  capitulated, and in less than a month, with the loss of only twenty  men, the English had made themselves masters of the whole country. The  inglorious campaign was ended, but the fact still existed that the  obnoxious Acadians outnumbered the English; and the question remained  as it was before the invasion. The deputy governor convened a council  \"to consider what disposal of the Acadians the security of the country  required.\" The result of the deliberations was this: The security of  the country required the banishment of the entire French population!    Lawrence and his associates soon invented a scheme which furnished  an excuse for carrying into effect this infamous order. An oath of  allegiance was formulated to which the Acadians as consistent Catholics  could not subscribe, without doing violence to their consciences. They  refused to take the oath, but declared their loyalty to the English  government. This they were told was insufficient. At one fell stroke  they were adjudged guilty of treason, and the surrender of their boats  and firearms demanded. To these acts of tyranny the Acadians submitted.  They even offered to take the oath first required of them, but the  deputy governor said the day of grace was past; that once having  refused to take it, they must now endure the consequences.    Their lands, houses and cattle were declared forfeited: their peaceful  hamlets were laid waste; their houses given to the flames; the fruits  of years of honest industry and strict economy were wantonly destroyed,  and the people driven to the larger coast towns. In one district two  hundred and thirty-six houses were burned to the ground at once.  Part of the inhabitants who had escaped to the woods beheld all they  possessed wickedly destroyed by bands of marauders, without making  any resistance until their place of worship was wantonly set on fire.  Exasperated by this unhallowed deed, they rushed from their hiding  places, killed about thirty of the incendiaries, and retreated to the  woods.    To render this scheme of tyrannical banishment completely effective,  further treachery was necessary. In each district the people were  commanded to meet at a certain place and day on important business,  the nature of which was carefully concealed from them, until they were  assembled and surrounded by English troops; then the inhuman edict of  banishment was announced to the heart-broken peasants. Very little time  was allowed them for preparation. In mournful crowds they were driven  to the beach. Women with white faces pressed their babes to their  hearts; children dumb with terror clung to their parents; the aged and  the infirm as well as the young and strong shared the common fate.    At the large village of Grand Pre, when the moment for embarkation  arrived, the young men, who were placed in the front, refused to move;  but files of troops with fixed bayonets forced obedience. As soon  as they were on board the British shipping, heavy columns of black  smoke ascending from Grand Pre announced to the wretched Acadians the  destruction of their lovely village.    The "]]]
