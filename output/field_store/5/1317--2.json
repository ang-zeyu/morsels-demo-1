Correspondence between ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, (JR.,) of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and MR. RICHARD C. EVANS, second  counselor (1905) in the Presidency of the \"Reorganized\" Church. A  conclusive refutation of the false charges persistently made by  ministers of the \"Reorganized\" Church against the Latter-day Saints and  their belief. Also a supplement containing a number of affidavits and  other matters bearing on the subjects.    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH    PRINTED IN U.S.A.        INTRODUCTION    The correspondence in this pamphlet was brought about through the  wilful misrepresentation of the doctrines of the Latter-day Saints and  the unwarranted abuse of the authorities of the Church by Mr. Richard  C. Evans, in an interview which appeared in the Toronto (Canada) _Daily  Star_ of January 28, 1905. A copy of the interview was placed in the  hands of the writer, who, on February 19th following, replied to Mr.  Evans in an open letter which was published in the Toronto Star on or  about the 25th of the month.[1] This open letter was answered by Mr.  Evans in a personal letter, and on the 23rd of May, a rejoinder to his  reply was sent to Mr. Evans at his home in London, Ontario, Canada.  In all, four communications--including the interview--have passed  between us, and all of these four communications are here reproduced  _in full_. A copy of the open letter which appeared in the _Star_,  was also sent to Mr. Evans who acknowledged its receipt. Nothing more  was done in regard to this correspondence until August 17th and 24th,  when an article containing a portion of it appeared in the _Zion's  Ensign_, published by the \"Reorganized\" church at Independence, Jackson  County, Missouri, under the title: \"Statements Authenticated,\" in which  it was made to appear that the full and complete communications were  reproduced. But this, however, was not the case.    In a letter from Mr. Evans to the editor of the _Ensign_ which  accompanied the above mentioned article, he said:    Believing that good will be accomplished by the publication of the  entire matter, I herewith mail you the referred to matter.    From this it would naturally be supposed that the _complete_  correspondence would be given. However I was not surprised to see that  Mr. Evans' side of the controversy was _in full_, while a large portion  of my first communication had been purposely suppressed; and that  my second letter _did not appear at all_! And thus was the \"_entire  matter_\" given to the readers of the _Ensign_ that \"good\" might be  \"accomplished.\" (?)    The parts that were purposely left out of my communication by Mr.  Evans, were most vital to the subject and have been indicated as they  appear in the body of this work by being placed in italics, excepting  a few minor matters which he omitted that I have not mentioned,  nevertheless matters that throw light upon the subject.    One of these quotations was in relation to two articles in the first  volume of the _Saints' Herald_ which were important, coming, as they  did from the \"enemy's\" camp. Here is the omitted part:        If you believe your statement to be true, will you kindly explain      the following passage in the _Saints' Herald_, your official organ,      volume I, page 9,--it would be well for you to read the entire      chapter, which is entitled \"Polygamy.\" The quotation is as follows:        \"The death of the Prophet is one fact that has been realized,      although he abhorred and repented of this iniquity (meaning      \"polygamy\") before his death. This branch of the subject we shall      leave to some of our brethren, who are qualified to explain it      satisfactorily.\"        In the same volume, page 27, what is meant by the following: \"He,      (Joseph Smith) caused the revelation on the subject (polygamy) to      be burned, and when he voluntarily came to Nauvoo and resigned      himself into the arms of his enemies he said that he was going to      Carthage to die. At that time he also said that if it had not been      for that accursed spiritual wife doctrine he would not have come to      that.\" Kindly read the context.        There is more evidence that can be produced, but if you will      explain this it may suffice.    The first half of the succeeding paragraph was quoted but the second  half was omitted. I quote in full with the part suppressed in italics:        In the light of the knowledge I have received and the evidence      at my command, I know that the Prophet Joseph Smith made no such      statement as the above, and that he did not have the revelation      burned. _There is, however, value in the above statements from your      \"Herald,\" for they bear witness to the origin and introduction of      the principle of plural marriage and revelation concerning the      same_.    It is easy to perceive that Mr. Evans felt \"that good will be  accomplished by the publication of the 'entire matter'\"; and for  that reason he omitted this evidence which the leaders of the  \"Reorganization\" have been trying so successfully to destroy for lo  these many years. The two articles in the _Saints' Herald_ have caused  the leaders of that sect no end of trouble, and today they are in  the same fix in regard to plural marriage that the first editor of  that paper was when he wrote, for they cannot explain the Prophet's  connection with the principle \"satisfactorily,\" and never will be able  to until they acknowledge the truth.    Another of Mr. Evans' ommissions that \"good\" might be \"accomplished\"  (?) is the following paragraph in reference to President Brigham Young:        It is true that President Young was elected president at      Kanesville; but on what grounds do you charge him with holding      the office in trust for the \"dead president's son?\" Do you not      know that such a statement --contrary to the written word--was      antagonistic to the teachings of President Young, as recorded in      the _Times and Seasons_, as well as since that time?        Will you please explain on what grounds you charge President Young      with being \"under suspicion at the time of Joseph Smith's death?\"      Am I to infer by this that you mean to convey the idea that Brigham      Young was in any way responsible for the death of Joseph Smith? The      Prophet never had a truer friend. You know that at the time of the      martyrdom Brigham Young was on a mission away from home. If this is      the inference you wish to convey, it is not only contemptible but      viciously false.    It appears from the actions of many of those who fight the Latter-day  Saints, that they fully realize their inability to successfully oppose  the doctrines of the Church with truth as a weapon of attack, and,  therefore, resort to falsehood, vilification and abuse, attempting to  blind those who are not acquainted with the facts. The doctrine of  the Church has survived all such onslaughts and continues to spread  throughout the earth, as a witness against those who have adopted such  base methods for its overthrow. It will continue to spread, bless  mankind and prepare all who accept it, and follow its teachings in  righteousness, for an inheritance in the kingdom of God.    The Reorganite ministers are generally in the front rank among those  who oppose the Church and resort to tactics of a doubtful character.  They travel from place to place, never losing an opportunity in  private, on the rostrum or through the press, to \"explain the radical  difference\" between their organization and that of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in denouncing \"the Utah Mormon and his  iniquities.\" On such occasions they will quote garbled and isolated  extracts from sermons and from writings by Elders of the Church, taking  particular pains to cover up the context in order to prejudice the  uninformed mind. In this way many a harmless, inoffensive passage has  been made to do great execution in some quarters and among a certain  class. Nor is this all. Nearly every crime that was committed within a  thousand miles of Utah in early days and many that were invented out of  whole cloth, are brought to bear against the \"dreadful Mormons,\" the  Church and the Gospel, that they may be stigmatized and made to appear  vile and hateful before the world. So much of their time is spent in  this way that they can surely have but little left in which to tell the  world what they themselves believe.    No reason except that of misrepresentation and jealousy can be assigned  for actions of this kind. These men oppose the truth in a spirit  of jealousy and to cover up their own false position, and by such  an attitude prove that they are ashamed of their own faith, being  conscious of its weakness.    The supplement following the correspondence is composed of a number  of affidavits and other testimony bearing on the subjects under  discussion, which, it is hoped, will be of interest and perhaps of  value to the reader.                                                  JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.    Salt Lake City, Utah, September 5, 1905.      Footnotes    1. As I did not receive a copy of the _Toronto Star_ I cannot  positively say that my article appeared in full, but if it did not Mr.  Evans is still without excuse for not considering the _entire matter_  for he received personally a duplicate copy of the article sent the  _Star_ which contained those portions he has failed to include in his  \"entire matter\" in the _Zion's Ensign_.

WHITNEY    Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles      SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH  1914        PREFACE AND DEDICATION.    This little book was written and compiled at the request of the General  Priesthood Committee, under the sanction of the First Presidency of the  Church, for the use and benefit of the Priesthood Classes, throughout  the Stakes and Wards of Zion.    The treatise, \"Gospel Themes,\" represents the best effort I could  make under the circumstances in which that effort was put forth.  Many interruptions occurred, consequent upon the performance of  other duties, and I had no opportunity to submit the manuscript to a  committee of revision, prior to publication; the usual course with  works of this character. I was barely able to get it ready for the  printer within the time allotted for its preparation. But I tried to be  accurate, and am not aware that I made any mistakes.    While lacking the help of a revisory committee, I received, and hereby  gratefully acknowledge, valuable suggestions from Elders David O. McKay  and Edward H. Anderson, members of the Priesthood Committee, and from  others whom I consulted. Moreover, Brother Anderson was with me in  proof-reading the work, and in engineering it through the press.    My aim has been, not to give exhaustive treatment to any subject, but  to throw in sight certain themes, and dwell briefly upon points of  doctrine, prophecy, history, and illustration, that I thought would be  helpful to the brethren of the Priesthood--those who are studying the  Gospel at home, and those who are preaching it abroad. To both classes  this volume is affectionately dedicated.                                                         THE AUTHOR.    Salt Lake City, Christmas, 1913.        CONTENTS.

The Story of God.    CHAPTER I.    A Divine Plan for Human Progress.    The Gospel Defined.--The English word \"Gospel\" comes from the  Anglo-Saxon \"Godspell,\" or God-story--the story of God. It derives its  significance from that great central idea of the Christian faith--the  coming of God as the Son of God to redeem and save mankind. The joyful  intelligence of the advent of the world's Redeemer, proclaimed by the  angels to the shepherds on the Judean hills (Luke 2:10), furnishes  another name for the gospel--\"good tidings,\" or, as it is otherwise  rendered, \"glad tidings of great joy.\"    God the Savior.--\"God himself shall come down among the children of  men, and shall redeem his people, and because he dwelleth in flesh  he shall be called the Son of God\" (Mosiah 15:1,2). prediction by  Abinadi the prophet, centuries before the birth of the Savior, had been  preceded by a This similar prophecy from King Benjamin, another Nephite  seer (Mosiah 3:5). The fulfilment of these foretellings is recorded in  the opening verses of the gospel according to St. John, where reference  is made to \"the Word\" that was in the beginning \"with God\"--the Word  that \"was God,\" and was \"made flesh\" and dwelt among men. In him, as  Paul affirms, \"dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\" (Col.  2:9).    Foundation and Superstructure.--When we speak of the gospel, therefore,  we should bear in mind that the term means something more than faith,  repentance, baptism, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy  Ghost, and other rituals and requirements in the Church of Christ.  We must not isolate \"the laws and ordinances of the gospel\" from the  basic principles upon which they rest--the mighty foundation stones of  sacrifice and redemption, without which all this sacred legislation  would be aimless and of no effect. Nor can the basic principles which  make operative those laws and ordinances be dissociated from the idea  of eternal progression, the great and paramount purpose for which the  gospel code was framed, the gospel in its fulness instituted.    Fulness of the Gospel.--The phrase, \"fulness of the gospel,\" should  be understood in a relative sense, as pertaining to the revealed will  of God. There can be no absolute fulness, with man, until all things  are made known to him. The fulness of the gospel as delivered to  the Nephites and other ancient peoples, and told of in the inspired  records that have come down to us, differed from, in that it was not  so complete as is the fulness of the gospel which the Latter-day  Saints enjoy. Truth is always the same; it never contradicts itself;  but more of its principles have been revealed in modern times than at  any previous period. Never before, upon this earth, has there been  such a gospel fulness as that delivered to the Prophet Joseph Smith.  And the end is not yet; for, as he himself said in one of his latest  recorded utterances: \"Those things which never have been revealed from  the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise  and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the  dispensation of the fulness of times\" (D&C 128:18).    It may help the reader to understand how there can be more than one  \"fulness of the gospel\" by bearing in mind what has been made known  concerning the final judgment, or the various awards of glory to be  meted out to redeemed souls after the resurrection. Their glory shall  be that by which their bodies are quickened, and whether quickened by  a portion of the celestial, the terrestrial, or the telestial glory,  they shall \"receive of the same, even a fulness\" (D&C 88:28-31). But  one fulness can differ from another, even as differ the glories, and  even as capacities differ--the power to receive and contain. The  absolute fulness of the gospel can only come to a people prepared to  receive and make a wise use of it. Until the Latter-day Saints are in  that condition, they must be content with a comparative fulness, or  all that they can contain of the divine wisdom. Paul the apostle was  contemplating this subject when he wrote: \"For we know in part, and we  prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that  which is in part shall be done away\" (1 Cor. 13:9,10).    Gospel Features.--The gospel, in its fullest sense, signifies  everything connected with the redemptive career of that glorious  and divine Being known among men as Jesus of Nazareth, but who was  and is no other than Jehovah, the God of Israel (D&C 110:1-4), who  \"came unto his own\" and was rejected by them, was crucified at their  instigation, and died to redeem the world. The accounts given by  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are properly termed \"gospels,\" because  they are narratives of the personal ministry of our Lord; but they  are only parts of the complete God-story. The Savior's life, death,  resurrection and ascension, with the conditions prescribed by him upon  which fallen man might profit further from his sacrifice for human  redemption,--these are all gospel features, but not the gospel in its  entirety. The full \"story\" of the Redeemer and Savior--the God who  died that man might live--involves events both past and future, events  premortal and post-mortal, scenes in which he was chosen to play his  mighty part in the great tragedy of human experience, and scenes yet to  come in which he will make another and a more glorious appearing upon  the stage of time, enacting the illustrious role of King of kings and  reigning over the earth a thousand years.    Salvation and Exaltation.--Paul defines the Gospel of Christ as \"the  power of God unto salvation\" (Rom. 1:16). He might have gone further,  had he so desired, or had it been timely, and shown that the Gospel  of Christ is the power of God unto exaltation--a plan devised by  Omnipotent Wisdom whereby man, the child of God, may advance from stage  to stage of soul development, until eventually he becomes like unto  his Heavenly Parent, inheriting eternal thrones and dominions, and  receiving \"a fulness of joy.\"    This is exaltation. It is more than salvation, being an extension of  that idea or condition--salvation \"added upon;\" just as salvation  is an extension of, or an addition to, redemption. A soul may be  redeemed--that is, raised from the dead, and yet condemned at the  final judgment for evil deeds done in the body. Likewise may a soul be  redeemed and saved, and yet come short of the glory that constitutes  exaltation. To redeem, save, and glorify, is the threefold purpose of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    Origin and Antiquity of the Gospel.--The gospel originated in the  heavens, before this earth was organized, and was revealed to man, out  of"]]]
