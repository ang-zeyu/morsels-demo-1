HENTY          [Illustration: IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO TRANSFER THE SACKS INTO THE BOAT  _Page 339_]          PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION      The mysterious loss of a large portion of the treasure of the Incas has  never been completely cleared up. By torturing the natives to whom the  secret had been entrusted, the Spaniards made two or three discoveries,  but there can be little doubt that these finds were only a small  proportion of the total amount of the missing hoards, although for  years after their occupation of the country the Spaniards spared no  pains and hesitated at no cruelty to bring to light the hidden wealth.  The story of the boat which put to sea laden with treasure is  historical, and it was generally supposed that she was lost in a storm  that took place soon after she sailed. It was also morally certain that  the Peruvians who left the country when the Spaniards became masters  carried off with them a very large amount of treasure into that part of  South America lying east of Peru. Legends are current that they founded  a great city there, and that their descendants occupy it at the present  time. But the forests are so thick, and the Indian tribes so hostile,  that the country has never yet been explored, and it may be reserved  for some future traveller, possessing the determination of my two  heroes, to clear up the mystery of this city as they penetrated that of  the lost treasure-ship. It need hardly be said that the state of  confusion, misrule, and incessant civil wars which I have described as  prevailing in Peru presents a true picture of the country at the period  in which this story is laid.

Map of Peru    [Illustration: MAP OF PERU]          THE TREASURE OF THE INCAS          CHAPTER I    HOW IT CAME ABOUT      Two men were sitting in the smoking-room of a London club. The room was  almost empty, and as they occupied arm-chairs in one corner of it, they  were able to talk freely without fear of being overheard. One of them  was a man of sixty, the other some five or six and twenty.    \"I must do something,\" the younger man said, \"for I have been kicking  my heels about London since my ship was paid off two years ago. At  first, of course, it didn't matter, for I have enough to live upon; but  recently I have been fool enough to fall in love with a girl whose  parents would never dream of allowing her to marry a half-pay  lieutenant of the navy with no chance in the world of getting employed  again, for I have no interest whatever.\"    \"It is an awkward case certainly, Prendergast,\" the other said; \"and  upon my word, though I sympathize with you, I cannot blame Fortescue.  He is not what you might call a genial man, but there is no doubt that  he was a splendid lawyer and a wonderful worker. For ten years he  earned more than any man at the bar. I know that he was twice offered  the solicitor-generalship, but as he was making two or three times the  official salary, he would not take it. I believe he would have gone on  working till now had he not suddenly come in for a very fine estate,  owing to the death, in the course of two or three years, of four men  who stood between him and it. Besides, I fancy he got hints that in the  general opinion of the bar he had had a wonderfully good innings, and  it was about time that younger men had a share in it. What his savings  were I do not know, but they must be very large. His three sons are all  at the bar, and are rising men, so there was no occasion for him to go  on piling up money for them. But, as I say, he has always had the  reputation of being a hard man, and it is practically certain that he  would never allow his daughter to marry a man whom he would regard as  next door to a pauper. Now, what are you thinking of doing?\"    \"Well, sir, Miss Fortescue has agreed to wait for me for two years, and  of course I am eager to do something, but the question is what? I can  sail a ship, but even could I get the command of a merchantman, it  would not improve my position in the eyes of the parents of the lady in  question. Now, you have been knocking about all over the world, I do  wish you would give me your advice. Where is there money to be got? I  am equally ready to go to the North Pole or the Equator, to enter the  service of an Indian prince, or to start in search of a treasure hidden  by the old bucaneers.\"    \"You talk Spanish, don't you?\"    \"Yes; all my service has been in the Mediterranean. We were two years  off the coast of Spain, and in and out of its ports, and as time hung  heavily on our hands, I got up the language partly to amuse myself and  partly to be able to talk fluently with my partners at a ball.\"    The elder man did not speak for a minute or two.    \"You have not thought of South America?\" he said at last.    \"No, Mr. Barnett; I don't know that I have ever thought of one place  more than another.\"    The other was again silent.    \"I don't think you could do better anywhere,\" he said slowly. \"It is a  land with great possibilities; at any rate it is a land where you could  be understood, and of course it would be folly to go anywhere without a  knowledge of the language. I was, as you know, five years out there,  and came home when the war broke out between Chili and the Spaniards. I  have been more in Peru than in Chili, and as Peru was still in the  hands of the Spanish, it would have been impossible for me to go there  again as long as the war lasted. Knocking about as I did, I heard a  great deal from the natives (I mean the Indians). I gathered from them  a number of their traditions, and I am convinced that they know of any  number of gold mines that were formerly worked, but were blocked up  when the Spaniards invaded the country, and have been kept secret ever  since.    \"The natives have never spoken on the subject at all to the Spaniards.  If they had, they would have been flogged until they revealed all they  knew--that is to say, they would have been flogged to death, for no  tortures will wring from an Indian anything he knows about gold. They  look upon that metal as the source of all the misfortunes that have  fallen upon their race. With an Englishman whom they knew and trusted,  and who, as they also knew, had no wish whatever to discover gold  mines, they were a little less reticent. I never asked them any  questions on a subject in which I had not a shadow of interest, but I  certainly had some curiosity, not of a pecuniary kind, because the  matter had always been a riddle as to the hiding-place of the Incas'  treasures. And from what I learned I should say it is absolutely  certain that a great portion of these escaped the search of their  Spanish tyrants.    \"Whether the men who were employed in the work all died without  revealing the secret, or whether it had been trusted to a chosen few, I  know not; but the natives believe that there are still a few among them  to whom the secret has been passed down from father to son. Anyhow, all  had heard vague traditions. Some said that part of the treasure was  carried hundreds of miles inland and given over to a tribe of fierce  savages, in a country into which no European can enter. Another  tradition is that a portion of it was carried off by sea in a great  canoe, which was never heard of again and was believed to have been  lost. I am not for a moment supposing, Prendergast, that if you went  out there you would have the most remote chance of discovering what the  Spaniards, ever since they landed there, have been in vain trying to  find, and I certainly should not think of recommending a mad-brained  adventure, but undoubtedly there are many rich gold mines yet to be  found. There are openings for trade, too; and I can give you  introductions to merchants both in Chili and Peru. It is not a thing I  should recommend to everyone, far from it; but if you want to combine  adventure with a chance, however small, of making money, I don't know  that you can do better than go to South America. You are fitted for no  calling here; your income, counting your half-pay, would suffice to  keep you out there, and a couple of years of such a life would do you  no harm.\"    \"It is just what I should like,\" the young man said enthusiastically;  \"though I don't know how I should set to work if I did find a mine.\"    \"You would have to bring home specimens, with particulars of the width  of the lode. Of course you would crush pieces up and wash them  yourself, or get your Indian to wash them; that would give you an  approximate idea of the percentage of gold. If it were rich, I could  introduce you to men who would advance money for working it, giving you  a share of the profits. They would send out a mining expert with you.  He would verify your report, and then you would take up the concession.  I don't know whether there have been any changes in the regulations,  but there is no difficulty in learning how to proceed from one or other  of the men to whom I will give you introductions.

The Last Chapter          CHAPTER 1    Why the Princess Has a Story About Her    There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great  country full of mountains and valleys.  His palace was built upon one  of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful.  The princess,  whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her  birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by  country people in a large house, half castle, half farmhouse, on the  side of another mountain, about half-way between its base and its peak.    The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story  begins was about eight years old, I think, but she got older very fast.  Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night sky,  each with a star dissolved in the blue.  Those eyes you would have  thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned  up in that direction.  The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars  in it, as like the sky as they could make it. But I doubt if ever she  saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better  mention at once.    These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns,  and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some  shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in.  There would not have been much known about them, had there not been  mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running  off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the  mountains were full.  In the course of digging, the miners came upon  many of these natural caverns.  A few of them had far-off openings out  on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine.    Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings,  called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins.  There was a  legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground,  and were very like other people.  But for some reason or other,  concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had  laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required  observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with  more severity, in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the  consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the  country.  According to the legend, however, instead of going to some  other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns,  whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed  themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once.  It was  only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains  that they were said to gather even at night in the open air.  Those who  had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in  the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from  the sun, in cold and wet and dark places.  They were now, not  ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously  grotesque both in face and form.  There was no invention, they said, of  the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could  surpass the extravagance of their appearance.  But I suspect those who  said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins  themselves--of which more by and by.  The goblins themselves were not  so far removed from the human as such a description would imply.  And  as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and  cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the  possibility of.  But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief,  and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy  the people who lived in the open-air storey above them.  They had  enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being  absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way;  but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those  who occupied their former possessions and especially against the  descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they  sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as  their inventors; and although dwarfed and misshapen, they had strength  equal to their cunning.  In the process of time they had got a king and  a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own  simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbours.  It will  now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at  night.  They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the  house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had  good reason, as we shall see by and by.        CHAPTER 2    The Princess Loses Herself    I have said the Princess Irene was about eight years old when my story  begins.  And this is how it begins.    One very wet day, when the mountain was covered with mist which was  constantly gathering itself together into raindrops, and pouring down  on the roofs of the great old house, whence it fell in a fringe of  water from the eaves all round about it, the princess could not of  course go out.  She got very tired, so tired that even her toys could  no longer amuse her.  You would wonder at that if I had time to  describe to you one half of the toys she had.  But then, you wouldn't  have the toys themselves, and that makes all the difference: you can't  get tired of a thing before you have it.  It was a picture, though,  worth seeing--the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling  over her head, at a great table covered with her toys.  If the artist  would like to draw this, I should advise him not to meddle with the  toys.  I am afraid of attempting to describe them, and I think he had  better not try to draw them.  He had better not.  He can do a thousand  things I can't, but I don't think he could draw those toys.  No man  could better make the princess herself than he could, though--leaning  with her back bowed into the back of the chair, her head hanging down,  and her hands in her lap, very miserable as she would say herself, not  even knowing what she would like, except it were to go out and get  thoroughly wet, and catch a particularly nice cold, and have to go to  bed and take gruel.  The next moment after you see her sitting there,  her nurse goes out of the room.    Even that is a change, and the princess wakes up a little, and looks  about her.  Then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door,  not the same door the nurse went out of, but one which opened at the  foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak, which looked as if never  anyone had set foot upon it.  She had once before been up six steps,  and that was sufficient reason, in such a day, for trying to find out  what was at the top of it.    Up and up she ran--such a long way it seemed to her!--until she came to  the top of the third flight.  There she found the landing was the end  of a long passage.  Into this she ran.  It was full of doors on each  side.  There were so many that she did not care to open any, but ran on  to the end, where she turned into another passage, also full of doors.  When she had turned twice more, and still saw doors and only doors  about her, she began to get frightened.  It was so silent!  And all  those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them!  That was dreadful.  Also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof.  She turned and  started at full speed, her little footsteps echoing through the sounds  of the rain--back for the stairs and her safe nursery.  So she thought,  but she had lost herself long ago.  It doesn't follow that she was  lost, because she had lost herself, though.    She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be  afraid.  Very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back. Rooms  everywhere, and no stair!  Her little heart beat as fast as her little  feet ran, and a lump of tears was growing in her throat. But she was  too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time.  At last her  hope failed her.  Nothing but passages and doors everywhere!  She threw  herself on the floor, and burst into a wailing cry broken by sobs.    She did not cry long, however, for she was as brave as could be  expected of a princess of her age.  After a good cry, she got up, and  brushed the dust from her frock.  Oh, what old dust it was! Then she  wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don't always have their  handkerchiefs in their pockets, any more than some other little girls I  know of.  Next, like a true princess, she resolved on going wisely to  work to find her way back: she would walk through the passages, and  look in every direction for the stair. This she did, but without  success.  She went over the same ground again an again without knowing  it, for the passages and doors were all alike.  At last, in"]]]
