For we shall be gainers, I take it, if this can be proved.'  Aristotle certainly knew the passage, and it looks as if his treatise on  poetry was an answer to Plato's challenge.    Few of the great works of ancient Greek literature are easy reading.  They nearly all need study and comment, and at times help from a good  teacher, before they yield up their secret. And the _Poetics_ cannot be  accounted an exception. For one thing the treatise is fragmentary. It  originally consisted of two books, one dealing with Tragedy and Epic,  the other with Comedy and other subjects. We possess only the first. For  another, even the book we have seems to be unrevised and unfinished. The  style, though luminous, vivid, and in its broader division systematic,  is not that of a book intended for publication. Like most of Aristotle's  extant writing, it suggests the MS. of an experienced lecturer, full of  jottings and adscripts, with occasional phrases written carefully  out, but never revised as a whole for the general reader. Even to  accomplished scholars the meaning is often obscure, as may be seen by a  comparison of the three editions recently published in England, all the  work of savants of the first eminence, (1) or, still more strikingly, by  a study of the long series of misunderstandings and overstatements  and corrections which form the history of the _Poetics_ since the  Renaissance.    (1) Prof. Butcher, 1895 and 1898; Prof. Bywater, 1909; and Prof.  Margoliouth, 1911.      But it is of another cause of misunderstanding that I wish principally  to speak in this preface. The great edition from which the present  translation is taken was the fruit of prolonged study by one of the  greatest Aristotelians of the nineteenth century, and is itself a  classic among works of scholarship. In the hands of a student who knows  even a little Greek, the translation, backed by the commentary, may lead  deep into the mind of Aristotle. But when the translation is used, as it  doubtless will be, by readers who are quite without the clue provided  by a knowledge of the general habits of the Greek language, there must  arise a number of new difficulties or misconceptions.    To understand a great foreign book by means of a translation is possible  enough where the two languages concerned operate with a common stock  of ideas, and belong to the same period of civilization. But between  ancient Greece and modern England there yawn immense gulfs of human  history; the establishment and the partial failure of a common European  religion, the barbarian invasions, the feudal system, the regrouping  of modern Europe, the age of mechanical invention, and the industrial  revolution. In an average page of French or German philosophy nearly all  the nouns can be translated directly into exact equivalents in English;  but in Greek that is not so. Scarcely one in ten of the nouns on the  first few pages of the _Poetics_ has an exact English equivalent. Every  proposition has to be reduced to its lowest terms of thought and then  re-built. This is a difficulty which no translation can quite deal with;  it must be left to a teacher who knows Greek. And there is a kindred  difficulty which flows from it. Where words can be translated into  equivalent words, the style of an original can be closely followed;  but no translation which aims at being written in normal English can  reproduce the style of Aristotle. I have sometimes played with the idea  that a ruthlessly literal translation, helped out by bold punctuation,  might be the best. For instance, premising that the words _poesis_,  _poetes_ mean originally 'making' and 'maker', one might translate the  first paragraph of the _Poetics_ thus:--    MAKING: kinds of making: function of each, and how the Myths ought to be  put together if the Making is to go right.    Number of parts: nature of parts: rest of same inquiry.    Begin in order of nature from first principles.    Epos-making, tragedy-making (also comedy), dithyramb-making (and most  fluting and harping), taken as a whole, are really not Makings but  Imitations. They differ in three points; they imitate (a) different  objects, (b) by different means, (c) differently (i.e. different  manner).    Some artists imitate (i.e. depict) by shapes and colours. (Obs.  sometimes by art, sometimes by habit.) Some by voice. Similarly the  above arts all imitate by rhythm, language, and tune, and these either  (1) separate or (2) mixed.    Rhythm and tune alone, harping, fluting, and other arts with same  effect--e.g. panpipes.    Rhythm without tune: dancing. (Dancers imitate characters, emotions, and  experiences by means of rhythms expressed in form.)    Language alone (whether prose or verse, and one form of verse or many):  this art has no name up to the present (i.e. there is no name to cover  mimes and dialogues and any similar imitation made in iambics,  elegiacs, &c. Commonly people attach the 'making' to the metre and say  'elegiac-makers', 'hexameter-makers,' giving them a common class-name by  their metre, as if it was not their imitation that makes them 'makers').      Such an experiment would doubtless be a little absurd, but it would give  an English reader some help in understanding both Aristotle's style and  his meaning.    For example, their enlightenment in the literal phrase, 'how the  myths ought to be put together.' The higher Greek poetry did not make  up fictitious plots; its business was to express the heroic saga, the  myths. Again, the literal translation of _poetes_, poet, as 'maker',  helps to explain a term that otherwise seems a puzzle in the _Poetics_.  If we wonder why Aristotle, and Plato before him, should lay such stress  on the theory that art is imitation, it is a help to realize that common  language called it 'making', and it was clearly not 'making' in the  ordinary sense. The poet who was 'maker' of a Fall of Troy clearly did  not make the real Fall of Troy. He made an imitation Fall of Troy. An  artist who 'painted Pericles' really 'made an imitation Pericles by  means of shapes and colours'. Hence we get started upon a theory of art  which, whether finally satisfactory or not, is of immense importance,  and are saved from the error of complaining that Aristotle did not  understand the 'creative power' of art.    As a rule, no doubt, the difficulty, even though merely verbal, lies  beyond the reach of so simple a tool as literal translation. To say that  tragedy 'imitates good men' while comedy 'imitates bad men' strikes a  modern reader as almost meaningless. The truth is that neither 'good'  nor 'bad' is an exact equivalent of the Greek. It would be nearer  perhaps to say that, relatively speaking, you look up to the characters  of tragedy, and down upon those of comedy. High or low, serious or  trivial, many other pairs of words would have to be called in, in order  to cover the wide range of the common Greek words. And the point is  important, because we have to consider whether in Chapter VI Aristotle  really lays it down that tragedy, so far from being the story  of un-happiness that we think it, is properly an imitation of  _eudaimonia_--a word often translated 'happiness', but meaning something  more like 'high life' or 'blessedness'. (1)    (1) See Margoliouth, p. 121. By water, with most editors, emends the  text.    Another difficult word which constantly recurs in the _Poetics_ is  _prattein_ or _praxis_, generally translated 'to act' or 'action'. But  _prattein_, like our 'do', also has an intransitive meaning 'to fare'  either well or ill; and Professor Margoliouth has pointed out that it  seems more true to say that tragedy shows how men 'fare' than how they  'act'. It shows their experiences or fortunes rather than merely their  deeds. But one must not draw the line too bluntly. I should doubt  whether a classical Greek writer was ordinarily conscious of the  distinction between the two meanings. Certainly it is easier to regard  happiness as a way of faring than as a form of action. Yet Aristotle can  use the passive of _prattein_ for things 'done' or 'gone through' (e.g.  52a, 22, 29: 55a, 25).    The fact is that much misunderstanding is often caused by our modern  attempts to limit too strictly the meaning of a Greek word. Greek was  very much a live language, and a language still unconscious of grammar,  not, like ours, dominated by definitions and trained upon dictionaries.  An instance is provided by Aristotle's famous saying that the typical  tragic hero is one who falls from high state or fame, not through vice  or depravity, but by some great _hamartia_. _Hamartia_ means originally  a 'bad shot' or 'error', but is currently used for 'offence' or 'sin'.  Aristotle clearly means that the typical hero is a great man with  'something wrong' in his life or character; but I think it is a mistake  of method to argue whether he means 'an intellectual error' or 'a moral  flaw'. The word is not so precise.

Introductory      These pages record some of the adventures of the First South Carolina  Volunteers, the first slave regiment mustered into the service of the  United States during the late civil war. It was, indeed, the first  colored regiment of any kind so mustered, except a portion of the troops  raised by Major-General Butler at New Orleans. These scarcely belonged  to the same class, however, being recruited from the free colored  population of that city, a comparatively self-reliant and educated race.  \"The darkest of them,\" said General Butler, \"were about the complexion  of the late Mr. Webster.\"    The First South Carolina, on the other hand, contained scarcely a  freeman, had not one mulatto in ten, and a far smaller proportion who  could read or write when enlisted. The only contemporary regiment of a  similar character was the \"First Kansas Colored,\" which began recruiting  a little earlier, though it was not mustered in the usual basis of  military seniority till later. [_See Appendix_] These were the only  colored regiments recruited during the year 1862. The Second South  Carolina and the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts followed early in 1863.    This is the way in which I came to the command of this regiment. One  day in November, 1862, I was sitting at dinner with my lieutenants,  John Goodell and Luther Bigelow, in the barracks of the Fifty-First  Massachusetts, Colonel Sprague, when the following letter was put into  my hands:    BEAUFORT, S. C., November 5, 1862.    MY DEAR SIR.    I am organizing the First Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers, with  every prospect of success. Your name has been spoken of, in connection  with the command of this regiment, by some friends in whose judgment I  have confidence. I take great pleasure in offering you the position of  Colonel in it, and hope that you may be induced to accept. I shall not  fill the place until I hear from you, or sufficient time shall have  passed for me to receive your reply. Should you accept, I enclose a  pass for Port Royal, of which I trust you will feel disposed to avail  yourself at once. I am, with sincere regard, yours truly,    R. SAXTON, _Brig.-Genl, Mil. Gov._    Had an invitation reached me to take command of a regiment of Kalmuck  Tartars, it could hardly have been more unexpected. I had always  looked for the arming of the blacks, and had always felt a wish to be  associated with them; had read the scanty accounts of General Hunter's  abortive regiment, and had heard rumors of General Saxton's renewed  efforts. But the prevalent tone of public sentiment was still opposed to  any such attempts; the government kept very shy of the experiment, and  it did not seem possible that the time had come when it could be fairly  tried.    For myself, I was at the head of a fine company of my own raising, and  in a regiment to which I was already much attached. It did not seem  desirable to exchange a certainty for an uncertainty; for who knew but  General Saxton might yet be thwarted in his efforts by the pro-slavery  influence that had still so much weight at head-quarters? It would be  intolerable to go out to South Carolina, and find myself, after all, at  the head of a mere plantation-guard or a day-school in uniform.    I therefore obtained from the War Department, through Governor Andrew,  permission to go and report to General Saxton, without at once resigning  my captaincy. Fortunately it took but a few days in South Carolina to  make it clear that all was right, and the return steamer took back a  resignation of a Massachusetts commission. Thenceforth my lot was cast  altogether with the black troops, except when regiments or detachments  of white soldiers were also under my command, during the two years  following.    These details would not be worth mentioning except as they show this  fact: that I did not seek the command of colored troops, but it sought  me. And this fact again is only important to my story for this reason,  that under these circumstances I naturally viewed the new recruits  rather as subjects for discipline than for philanthropy. I had been  expecting a war for six years, ever since the Kansas troubles, and my  mind had dwelt on military matters more or less during all that time.  The best Massachusetts regiments already exhibited a high standard of  drill and discipline, and unless these men could be brought tolerably  near that standard, the fact of their extreme blackness would afford me,  even as a philanthropist, no satisfaction. Fortunately, I felt perfect  confidence that they could be so trained, having happily known, by  experience, the qualities of their race, and knowing also that they had  home and household and freedom to fight for, besides that abstraction  of \"the Union.\" Trouble might perhaps be expected from white officials,  though this turned out far less than might have been feared; but there  was no trouble to come from the men, I thought, and none ever came. On  the other hand, it was a vast experiment of indirect philanthropy, and  one on which the result of the war and the destiny of the negro race  might rest; and this was enough to tax all one's powers. I had been an  abolitionist too long, and had known and loved John Brown too well, not  to feel a thrill of joy at last on finding myself in the position where  he only wished to be.    In view of all this, it was clear that good discipline must come first;  after that, of course, the men must be helped and elevated in all ways  as much as possible.    Of discipline there was great need, that is, of order and regular  instruction. Some of the men had already been under fire, but they were  very ignorant of drill and camp duty. The officers, being appointed from  a dozen different States, and more than as many regiments, infantry,  cavalry, artillery, and engineers, had all that diversity of methods  which so confused our army in those early days. The first need,  therefore, was of an unbroken interval of training. During this period,  which fortunately lasted nearly two months, I rarely left the camp, and  got occasional leisure moments for a fragmentary journal, to send home,  recording the many odd or novel aspects of the new experience. Camp-life  was a wonderfully strange sensation to almost all volunteer officers,  and mine lay among eight hundred men suddenly transformed from slaves  into soldiers, and representing a race affectionate, enthusiastic,  grotesque, and dramatic beyond all others. Being such, they naturally  gave material for description. There is nothing like a diary for  freshness, at least so I think, and I shall keep to the diary through  the days of camp-life, and throw the later experience into another form.  Indeed, that matter takes care of itself; diaries and letter-writing  stop when field-service begins.    I am under pretty heavy bonds to tell the truth, and only the truth; for  those who look back to the newspaper correspondence of that period  will see that this particular regiment lived for months in a glare of  publicity, such as tests any regiment severely, and certainly prevents  all subsequent romancing in its historian. As the scene of the only  effort on the Atlantic coast to arm the negro, our camp attracted a  continuous stream of visitors, military and civil. A battalion of black  soldiers, a spectacle since so common, seemed then the most daring of  innovations, and the whole demeanor of this particular regiment was  watched with microscopic scrutiny by friends and foes. I felt sometimes  as if we were a plant trying to take root, but constantly pulled up to  see if we were growing. The slightest camp incidents sometimes came  back to us, magnified and distorted, in letters of anxious inquiry from  remote parts of the Union. It was no pleasant thing to live under such  constant surveillance; but it guaranteed the honesty of any success,  while fearfully multiplying the penalties had there been a failure.  A single mutiny, such as has happened in the infancy of a hundred  regiments, a single miniature Bull Run, a stampede of desertions, and it  would have been all over with us; the party of distrust would have got  the upper hand, and there might not have been, during the whole contest,  another effort to arm the negro.    I may now proceed, without farther preparation to the Diary.          Chapter 2. Camp Diary      CAMP SAXTON, near Beaufort, S. C., November 24, 1862.    Yesterday afternoon we were steaming over a summer sea, the deck level  as a parlor-floor, no land in sight, no sail, until at last appeared one  light-house, said to be Cape Romaine, and then a line of trees and  two distant vessels and nothing more. The sun set, a great illuminated  bubble, submerged in one vast bank of rosy suffusion; it grew dark;  after tea all were on deck, the people sang hymns; then the moon set,  a moon two days old, a curved pencil of light, reclining backwards on a  radiant couch which seemed to rise from the waves to receive it; it sank  slowly, and the last tip wavered and went down like the mast of a vessel  of the skies. Towards morning the boat stopped, and when I came on deck,  before six,      \"The watch-lights glittered on the land,"]]]
