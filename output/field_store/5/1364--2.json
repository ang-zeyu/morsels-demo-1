If the machinery of the Law could be depended on to fathom every case  of suspicion, and to conduct every process of inquiry, with moderate  assistance only from the lubricating influences of oil of gold, the  events which fill these pages might have claimed their share of the  public attention in a Court of Justice.    But the Law is still, in certain inevitable cases, the pre-engaged  servant of the long purse; and the story is left to be told, for the  first time, in this place.  As the Judge might once have heard it, so  the Reader shall hear it now.  No circumstance of importance, from the  beginning to the end of the disclosure, shall be related on hearsay  evidence.  When the writer of these introductory lines (Walter  Hartright by name) happens to be more closely connected than others  with the incidents to be recorded, he will describe them in his own  person.  When his experience fails, he will retire from the position of  narrator; and his task will be continued, from the point at which he  has left it off, by other persons who can speak to the circumstances  under notice from their own knowledge, just as clearly and positively  as he has spoken before them.    Thus, the story here presented will be told by more than one pen, as  the story of an offence against the laws is told in Court by more than  one witness--with the same object, in both cases, to present the truth  always in its most direct and most intelligible aspect; and to trace  the course of one complete series of events, by making the persons who  have been most closely connected with them, at each successive stage,  relate their own experience, word for word.    Let Walter Hartright, teacher of drawing, aged twenty-eight years, be  heard first.        II    It was the last day of July.  The long hot summer was drawing to a  close; and we, the weary pilgrims of the London pavement, were  beginning to think of the cloud-shadows on the corn-fields, and the  autumn breezes on the sea-shore.    For my own poor part, the fading summer left me out of health, out of  spirits, and, if the truth must be told, out of money as well. During  the past year I had not managed my professional resources as carefully  as usual; and my extravagance now limited me to the prospect of  spending the autumn economically between my mother's cottage at  Hampstead and my own chambers in town.    The evening, I remember, was still and cloudy; the London air was at  its heaviest; the distant hum of the street-traffic was at its  faintest; the small pulse of the life within me, and the great heart of  the city around me, seemed to be sinking in unison, languidly and more  languidly, with the sinking sun.  I roused myself from the book which I  was dreaming over rather than reading, and left my chambers to meet the  cool night air in the suburbs.  It was one of the two evenings in every  week which I was accustomed to spend with my mother and my sister.  So  I turned my steps northward in the direction of Hampstead.    Events which I have yet to relate make it necessary to mention in this  place that my father had been dead some years at the period of which I  am now writing; and that my sister Sarah and I were the sole survivors  of a family of five children.  My father was a drawing-master before  me.  His exertions had made him highly successful in his profession;  and his affectionate anxiety to provide for the future of those who  were dependent on his labours had impelled him, from the time of his  marriage, to devote to the insuring of his life a much larger portion  of his income than most men consider it necessary to set aside for that  purpose.  Thanks to his admirable prudence and self-denial my mother  and sister were left, after his death, as independent of the world as  they had been during his lifetime.  I succeeded to his connection, and  had every reason to feel grateful for the prospect that awaited me at  my starting in life.    The quiet twilight was still trembling on the topmost ridges of the  heath; and the view of London below me had sunk into a black gulf in  the shadow of the cloudy night, when I stood before the gate of my  mother's cottage.  I had hardly rung the bell before the house door was  opened violently; my worthy Italian friend, Professor Pesca, appeared  in the servant's place; and darted out joyously to receive me, with a  shrill foreign parody on an English cheer.    On his own account, and, I must be allowed to add, on mine also, the  Professor merits the honour of a formal introduction. Accident has made  him the starting-point of the strange family story which it is the  purpose of these pages to unfold.    I had first become acquainted with my Italian friend by meeting him at  certain great houses where he taught his own language and I taught  drawing.  All I then knew of the history of his life was, that he had  once held a situation in the University of Padua; that he had left  Italy for political reasons (the nature of which he uniformly declined  to mention to any one); and that he had been for many years respectably  established in London as a teacher of languages.    Without being actually a dwarf--for he was perfectly well proportioned  from head to foot--Pesca was, I think, the smallest human being I ever  saw out of a show-room.  Remarkable anywhere, by his personal  appearance, he was still further distinguished among the rank and file  of mankind by the harmless eccentricity of his character.  The ruling  idea of his life appeared to be, that he was bound to show his  gratitude to the country which had afforded him an asylum and a means  of subsistence by doing his utmost to turn himself into an Englishman.  Not content with paying the nation in general the compliment of  invariably carrying an umbrella, and invariably wearing gaiters and a  white hat, the Professor further aspired to become an Englishman in his  habits and amusements, as well as in his personal appearance.  Finding  us distinguished, as a nation, by our love of athletic exercises, the  little man, in the innocence of his heart, devoted himself impromptu to  all our English sports and pastimes whenever he had the opportunity of  joining them; firmly persuaded that he could adopt our national  amusements of the field by an effort of will precisely as he had  adopted our national gaiters and our national white hat.    I had seen him risk his limbs blindly at a fox-hunt and in a  cricket-field; and soon afterwards I saw him risk his life, just as  blindly, in the sea at Brighton.    We had met there accidentally, and were bathing together.  If we had  been engaged in any exercise peculiar to my own nation I should, of  course, have looked after Pesca carefully; but as foreigners are  generally quite as well able to take care of themselves in the water as  Englishmen, it never occurred to me that the art of swimming might  merely add one more to the list of manly exercises which the Professor  believed that he could learn impromptu.  Soon after we had both struck  out from shore, I stopped, finding my friend did not gain on me, and  turned round to look for him.  To my horror and amazement, I saw  nothing between me and the beach but two little white arms which  struggled for an instant above the surface of the water, and then  disappeared from view.  When I dived for him, the poor little man was  lying quietly coiled up at the bottom, in a hollow of shingle, looking  by many degrees smaller than I had ever seen him look before.  During  the few minutes that elapsed while I was taking him in, the air revived  him, and he ascended the steps of the machine with my assistance.  With  the partial recovery of his animation came the return of his wonderful  delusion on the subject of swimming.  As soon as his chattering teeth  would let him speak, he smiled vacantly, and said he thought it must  have been the Cramp.    When he had thoroughly recovered himself, and had joined me on the  beach, his warm Southern nature broke through all artificial English  restraints in a moment.  He overwhelmed me with the wildest expressions  of affection--exclaimed passionately, in his exaggerated Italian way,  that he would hold his life henceforth at my disposal--and declared  that he should never be happy again until he had found an opportunity  of proving his gratitude by rendering me some service which I might  remember, on my side, to the end of my days.    I did my best to stop the torrent of his tears and protestations by  persisting in treating the whole adventure as a good subject for a  joke; and succeeded at last, as I imagined, in lessening Pesca's  overwhelming sense of obligation to me.  Little did I think  then--little did I think afterwards when our pleasant holiday had drawn  to an end--that the opportunity of serving me for which my grateful  companion so ardently longed was soon to come; that he was eagerly to  seize it on the instant;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#1)"],[1,"NIG;    or,    Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, In A Two-Story White House,  North.

PREFACE.      IN offering to the public the following pages, the writer confesses her  inability to minister to the refined and cultivated, the pleasure  supplied by abler pens. It is not for such these crude narrations  appear. Deserted by kindred, disabled by failing health, I am forced to  some experiment which shall aid me in maintaining myself and child  without extinguishing this feeble life. I would not from these motives  even palliate slavery at the South, by disclosures of its appurtenances  North. My mistress was wholly imbued with SOUTHERN principles. I do not  pretend to divulge every transaction in my own life, which the  unprejudiced would declare unfavorable in comparison with treatment of  legal bondmen; I have purposely omitted what would most provoke shame in  our good anti-slavery friends at home.    My humble position and frank confession of errors will, I hope, shield  me from severe criticism. Indeed, defects are so apparent it requires no  skilful hand to expose them.    I sincerely appeal to my colored brethren universally for patronage,  hoping they will not condemn this attempt of their sister to be erudite,  but rally around me a faithful band of supporters and defenders.    H. E. W.            OUR NIG.        CHAPTER I.    MAG SMITH, MY MOTHER.        Oh, Grief beyond all other griefs, when fate      First leaves the young heart lone and desolate      In the wide world, without that only tie      For which it loved to live or feared to die;      Lorn as the hung-up lute, that ne'er hath spoken      Since the sad day its master-chord was broken!        MOORE.        LONELY MAG SMITH! See her as she walks with downcast eyes and heavy  heart. It was not always thus. She HAD a loving, trusting heart. Early  deprived of parental guardianship, far removed from relatives, she was  left to guide her tiny boat over life's surges alone and inexperienced.  As she merged into womanhood, unprotected, uncherished, uncared for,  there fell on her ear the music of love, awakening an intensity of  emotion long dormant. It whispered of an elevation before unaspired to;  of ease and plenty her simple heart had never dreamed of as hers. She  knew the voice of her charmer, so ravishing, sounded far above her. It  seemed like an angel's, alluring her upward and onward. She thought she  could ascend to him and become an equal. She surrendered to him a  priceless gem, which he proudly garnered as a trophy, with those of  other victims, and left her to her fate. The world seemed full of  hateful deceivers and crushing arrogance. Conscious that the great bond  of union to her former companions was severed, that the disdain of  others would be insupportable, she determined to leave the few friends  she possessed, and seek an asylum among strangers. Her offspring came  unwelcomed, and before its nativity numbered weeks, it passed from  earth, ascending to a purer and better life.    \"God be thanked,\" ejaculated Mag, as she saw its breathing cease; \"no  one can taunt HER with my ruin.\"    Blessed release! may we all respond. How many pure, innocent children  not only inherit a wicked heart of their own, claiming life-long  scrutiny and restraint, but are heirs also of parental disgrace and  calumny, from which only long years of patient endurance in paths of  rectitude can disencumber them.    Mag's new home was soon contaminated by the publicity of her fall; she  had a feeling of degradation oppressing her; but she resolved to be  circumspect, and try to regain in a measure what she had lost. Then some  foul tongue would jest of her shame, and averted looks and cold  greetings disheartened her. She saw she could not bury in forgetfulness  her misdeed, so she resolved to leave her home and seek another in the  place she at first fled from.    Alas, how fearful are we to be first in extending a helping hand to  those who stagger in the mires of infamy; to speak the first words of  hope and warning to those emerging into the sunlight of morality! Who  can tell what numbers, advancing just far enough to hear a cold welcome  and join in the reserved converse of professed reformers, disappointed,  disheartened, have chosen to dwell in unclean places, rather than  encounter these \"holier-than-thou\" of the great brotherhood of man!    Such was Mag's experience; and disdaining to ask favor or friendship  from a sneering world, she resolved to shut herself up in a hovel she  had often passed in better days, and which she knew to be untenanted.  She vowed to ask no favors of familiar faces; to die neglected and  forgotten before she would be dependent on any. Removed from the  village, she was seldom seen except as upon your introduction, gentle  reader, with downcast visage, returning her work to her employer, and  thus providing herself with the means of subsistence. In two years many  hands craved the same avocation; foreigners who cheapened toil and  clamored for a livelihood, competed with her, and she could not thus  sustain herself. She was now above no drudgery. Occasionally old  acquaintances called to be favored with help of some kind, which she was  glad to bestow for the sake of the money it would bring her; but the  association with them was such a painful reminder of by-gones, she  returned to her hut morose and revengeful, refusing all offers of a  better home than she possessed. Thus she lived for years, hugging her  wrongs, but making no effort to escape. She had never known plenty,  scarcely competency; but the present was beyond comparison with those  innocent years when the coronet of virtue was hers.    Every year her melancholy increased, her means diminished. At last no  one seemed to notice her, save a kind-hearted African, who often called  to inquire after her health and to see if she needed any fuel, he having  the responsibility of furnishing that article, and she in return mending  or making garments.    \"How much you earn dis week, Mag?\" asked he one Saturday evening.    \"Little enough, Jim. Two or three days without any dinner. I washed for  the Reeds, and did a small job for Mrs. Bellmont; that's all. I shall  starve soon, unless I can get more to do. Folks seem as afraid to come  here as if they expected to get some awful disease. I don't believe  there is a person in the world but would be glad to have me dead and out  of the way.\"    \"No, no, Mag! don't talk so. You shan't starve so long as I have barrels  to hoop. Peter Greene boards me cheap. I'll help you, if nobody else  will.\"    A tear stood in Mag's faded eye. \"I'm glad,\" she said, with a softer  tone than before, \"if there is ONE who isn't glad to see me suffer. I  b'lieve all Singleton wants to see me punished, and feel as if they  could tell when I've been punished long enough. It's a long day ahead  they'll set it, I reckon.\"    After the usual supply of fuel was prepared, Jim returned home. Full of  pity for Mag, he set about devising measures for her relief. \"By golly!\"  said he to himself one day--for he had become so absorbed in Mag's  interest that he had fallen into a habit of musing aloud--\"By golly! I  wish she'd MARRY me.\"    \"Who?\" shouted Pete Greene, suddenly starting from an unobserved corner  of the rude shop.    \"Where you come from, you sly nigger!\" exclaimed Jim.    \"Come, tell me, who is't?\" said Pete; \"Mag Smith, you want to marry?\"    \"Git out, Pete! and when you come in dis shop again, let a nigger know  it. Don't steal in like a thief.\"    Pity and love know little severance. One attends the other. Jim  acknowledged the presence of the former, and his efforts in Mag's behalf  told also of a finer principle.    This sudden expedient which he had unintentionally disclosed, roused his  thinking and inventive powers to study upon the best method of  introducing the subject to Mag.    He belted his barrels, with many a scheme revolving in his mind, none of  which quite satisfied him, or seemed, on the whole, expedient. He  thought of the pleasing contrast between her fair face and his own dark  skin; the smooth, straight hair, which he had once, in expression of  pity, kindly stroked on her now wrinkled but once fair brow. There was a  tempest gathering in his heart, and at last, to ease his pent-up  passion, he exclaimed aloud, \"By golly!\" Recollecting his former  exposure, he glanced around to see if Pete was in hearing again.  Satisfied on this point, he continued: \"She'd be as much of a prize to  me as she'd fall short of coming up to the mark with white folks. I  don't care for past things. I've done things 'fore now I's 'shamed of.  She's good enough for me, any how.\"    One more glance about the premises to be sure Pete was away.    The next Saturday night brought Jim to the hovel again. The cold was  fast coming to tarry its apportioned time. Mag was nearly despairing of  meeting its rigor.    \"How's the wood, Mag?\" asked Jim.    \"All gone; and no more to cut, any how,\" was the reply.    \"Too bad!\" Jim said. His truthful reply would have been, I'm glad.    \"Anything to eat in the house?\" continued he.    \"No,\" replied Mag."]]]
