Written and Compiled by his Sister,    Eliza R. Snow Smith.    \"I know him, that he will command his children after him, and they  shall keep the word of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\"    \"If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God--possessing the  principles which God possesses.\"--Joseph Smith.    Salt Lake City, Utah,    Deseret News Company, Printers.    1884.        Preface.    This Biography and Autobiography of my brother, Lorenzo Snow, has been  written as a tribute of sisterly affection for him; and as a token of  sincere respect to his family.    It is designed to be handed down in lineal descent, from generation to  generation--to be preserved as a family Memorial.    In adapting it to this purpose, both in the matter originated, and in  that compiled, the writer has varied materially from the usual course  of biographers. That it may constitute a historical point to which  my brother's posterity, to the latest generations, who shall honor  the Gospel of the Son of God, may trace their origin in the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and find a record of their  illustrious ancestor--his wives, children and grandchildren--a full  genealogical record is inserted. That his descendants may profit by his  instructions, selections from his letters and discourses are copied  into this work; we also have inscribed missionary sketches of some of  his sons and sons-in-law.
