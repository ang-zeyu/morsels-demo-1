TABLE OF CONTENTS         PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION (1888)       PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION (1890)       PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION (1902)       PROEM: POLAND AND THE POLES       CHAPTERS I-XIX          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION        While the novelist has absolute freedom to follow his artistic instinct  and intelligence, the biographer is fettered by the subject-matter with  which he proposes to deal. The former may hopefully pursue an ideal, the  latter must rest satisfied with a compromise between the desirable and  the necessary. No doubt, it is possible to thoroughly digest all the  requisite material, and then present it in a perfect, beautiful form.  But this can only be done at a terrible loss, at a sacrifice of truth  and trustworthiness. My guiding principle has been to place before the  reader the facts collected by me as well as the conclusions at which I  arrived. This will enable him to see the subject in all its bearings,  with all its pros and cons, and to draw his own conclusions, should  mine not obtain his approval. Unless an author proceeds in this way,  the reader never knows how far he may trust him, how far the evidence  justifies his judgment. For--not to speak of cheats and fools--the  best informed are apt to make assertions unsupported or insufficiently  supported by facts, and the wisest cannot help seeing things through the  coloured spectacles of their individuality. The foregoing remarks are  intended to explain my method, not to excuse carelessness of literary  workmanship. Whatever the defects of the present volumes may be--and, no  doubt, they are both great and many--I have laboured to the full extent  of my humble abilities to group and present my material perspicuously,  and to avoid diffuseness and rhapsody, those besetting sins of writers  on music.    The first work of some length having Chopin for its subject was Liszt's  \"Frederic Chopin,\" which, after appearing in 1851 in the Paris journal  \"La France musicale,\" came out in book-form, still in French, in 1852  (Leipzig: Breitkopf and Hartel.--Translated into English by M. W. Cook,  and published by William Reeves, London, 1877). George Sand describes  it as \"un peu exuberant de style, mais rempli de bonnes choses et de  tres-belles pages.\" These words, however, do in no way justice to the  book: for, on the one hand, the style is excessively, and not merely  a little, exuberant; and, on the other hand, the \"good things\" and  \"beautiful pages\" amount to a psychological study of Chopin, and an  aesthetical study of his works, which it is impossible to over-estimate.  Still, the book is no biography. It records few dates and events, and  these few are for the most part incorrect. When, in 1878, the second  edition of F. Chopin was passing through the press, Liszt remarked to  me:--    \"I have been told that there are wrong dates and other mistakes in my  book, and that the dates and facts are correctly given in Karasowski's  biography of Chopin [which had in the meantime been published]. But,  though I often thought of reading it, I have not yet done so. I got my  information from Paris friends on whom I believed I might depend. The  Princess Wittgenstein [who then lived in Rome, but in 1850 at Weimar,  and is said to have had a share in the production of the book] wished me  to make some alterations in the new edition. I tried to please her, but,  when she was still dissatisfied, I told her to add and alter whatever  she liked.\"    From this statement it is clear that Liszt had not the stuff of a  biographer in him. And, whatever value we may put on the Princess  Wittgenstein's additions and alterations, they did not touch the vital  faults of the work, which, as a French critic remarked, was a symphonie  funebre rather than a biography. The next book we have to notice, M. A.  Szulc's Polish Fryderyk Chopin i Utwory jego Muzyczne (Posen, 1873), is  little more than a chaotic, unsifted collection of notices, criticisms,  anecdotes, &c., from Polish, German, and French books and magazines. In  1877 Moritz Karasowski, a native of Warsaw, and since 1864 a member of  the Dresden orchestra, published his Friedrich Chopin: sein Leben, seine  Werke und seine Briefe (Dresden: F. Ries.--Translated into English by  E. Hill, under the title Frederick Chopin: \"His Life, Letters, and Work,\"  and published by William Reeves, London, in 1879). This was the first  serious attempt at a biography of Chopin. The author reproduced in  the book what had been brought to light in Polish magazines and other  publications regarding Chopin's life by various countrymen of the  composer, among whom he himself was not the least notable. But the most  valuable ingredients are, no doubt, the Chopin letters which the author  obtained from the composer's relatives, with whom he was acquainted.  While gratefully acknowledging his achievements, I must not omit to  indicate his shortcomings--his unchecked partiality for, and boundless  admiration of his hero; his uncritical acceptance and fanciful  embellishments of anecdotes and hearsays; and the extreme paucity of his  information concerning the period of Chopin's life which begins with  his settlement in Paris. In 1878 appeared a second edition of the work,  distinguished from the first by a few additions and many judicious  omissions, the original two volumes being reduced to one. But of more  importance than the second German edition is the first Polish edition,  \"Fryderyk Chopin: Zycie, Listy, Dziela,\" two volumes (Warsaw: Gebethner  and Wolff, 1882), which contains a series of, till then, unpublished  letters from Chopin to Fontana. Of Madame A. Audley's short and readable  \"Frederic Chopin, sa vie et ses oeuvres\" (Paris: E. Plon et Cie., 1880),  I need only say that for the most part it follows Karasowski, and where  it does not is not always correct. Count Wodzinski's \"Les trois Romans  de Frederic Chopin\" (Paris: Calmann Levy, 1886)--according to the title  treating only of the composer's love for Constantia Gladkowska, Maria  Wodzinska, and George Sand, but in reality having a wider scope--cannot  be altogether ignored, though it is more of the nature of a novel than  of a biography. Mr. Joseph Bennett, who based his \"Frederic Chopin\" (one  of Novello's Primers of Musical Biography) on Liszt's and Karasowski's  works, had in the parts dealing with Great Britain the advantage of  notes by Mr. A.J. Hipkins, who inspired also, to some extent at least,  Mr. Hueffer in his essay Chopin (\"Fortnightly Review,\" September, 1877;  and reprinted in \"Musical Studies\"--Edinburgh: A. & C. Black, 1880).  This ends the list of biographies with any claims to originality. There  are, however, many interesting contributions to a biography of Chopin  to be found in works of various kinds. These shall be mentioned in  the course of my narrative; here I will point out only the two most  important ones--namely, George Sand's \"Histoire de ma Vie,\" first  published in the Paris newspaper \"La Presse\" (1854) and subsequently in  book-form; and her six volumes of \"Correspondance,\" 1812-1876 (Paris:  Calmann Levy, 1882-1884).    My researches had for their object the whole life of Chopin, and his  historical, political, artistical, social, and personal surroundings,  but they were chiefly directed to the least known and most interesting  period of his career--his life in France, and his visits to Germany and  Great Britain. My chief sources of information are divisible into two  classes--newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, correspondences, and books;  and conversations I held with, and letters I received from, Chopin's  pupils, friends, and acquaintances. Of his pupils, my warmest thanks are  due to Madame Dubois (nee Camille O'Meara), Madame Rubio (nee Vera de  Kologrivof), Mdlle. Gavard, Madame Streicher (nee Friederike Muller),  Adolph Gutmann, M. Georges Mathias, Brinley Richards, and Lindsay  Sloper; of friends and acquaintances, to Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller,  Franchomme, Charles Valentin Alkan, Stephen Heller, Edouard Wolff, Mr.  Charles Halle, Mr. G. A. Osborne, T. Kwiatkowski, Prof. A. Chodzko, M.  Leonard Niedzwiecki (gallice, Nedvetsky), Madame Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt,  Mr. A. J. Hipkins, and Dr. and Mrs. Lyschinski. I am likewise greatly  indebted to Messrs. Breitkopf and Hartel, Karl Gurckhaus (the late  proprietor of the firm of Friedrich Kistner), Julius Schuberth,  Friedrich Hofmeister, Edwin Ashdown, Richault & Cie, and others, for  information in connection with the publication of Chopin's works. It is  impossible to enumerate all my obligations--many of my informants and  many furtherers of my labours will be mentioned in the body of the book;  many, however, and by no means the least helpful, will remain unnamed.  To all of them I offer the assurance of my deep-felt gratitude. Not a  few of my kind helpers, alas! are no longer among the living; more than  ten years have gone by since I began my researches, and during that time  Death has been reaping a rich harvest.    The Chopin letters will, no doubt, be regarded as a special feature  of the present biography. They may, I think, be called numerous, if we  consider the master's dislike to letter-writing. Ferdinand Hiller--whose  almost unique collection of letters addressed to him by his famous  friends in art and literature is now, and will be for years to come,  under lock and key among the municipal archives at Cologne--allowed  me to copy two letters by Chopin, one of them written conjointly with  Liszt. Franchomme, too, granted me the privilege of copying his friend's  epistolary communications. Besides a number of letters that have here  and there been published, I include, further, a translation of Chopin's  letters to Fontana, which in Karasowski's book (i.e., the Polish  edition) lose much of their value, owing to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#1)"],[1,"TWICE TRAVERSED.

The original journals of the field notes, from which the present  narrative is compiled, were published, as each expedition ended, as  parliamentary papers by the Government of the Colony of South  Australia.    The journals of the first two expeditions, formed a small book, which  was distributed mostly to the patrons who had subscribed to the fund  for my second expedition. The account of the third, found its way into  the South Australian \"Observer,\" while the records of the fourth and  fifth journeys remained as parliamentary documents, the whole never  having appeared together. Thus only fragments of the accounts of my  wanderings became known; and though my name as an explorer has been  heard of, both in Australia and England, yet very few people even in  the Colonies are aware of what I have really done. Therefore it was  thought that a work embodying the whole of my explorations might be  acceptable to both English and Colonial readers.    Some years have been allowed to elapse since these journeys were  commenced; but the facts are the same, and to those not mixed up in  the adventures, the incidents as fresh as when they occurred.    Unavoidably, I have had to encounter a large area of desert country in  the interior of the colonies of South Australia, and Western  Australia, in my various wanderings; but I also discovered  considerable tracts of lands watered and suitable for occupation.    It is not in accordance with my own feelings in regard to Australia  that I am the chronicler of her poorer regions; and although an  Englishman, Australia has no sincerer well-wisher; had it been  otherwise, I could not have performed the work these volumes record.  It has indeed been often a cause of regret that my lines of march  should have led me away from the beautiful and fertile places upon  Australia's shores, where our countrymen have made their homes.    On the subject of the wonderful resources of Australia I am not called  upon to enlarge, and surely all who have heard her name must have  heard also of her gold, copper, wool, wine, beef, mutton, wheat,  timber, and other products; and if any other evidence were wanting to  show what Australia really is, a visit to her cities, and an  experience of her civilisation, not forgetting the great revenues of  her different provinces, would dispel at once all previous inaccurate  impressions of those who, never having seen, perhaps cannot believe in  the existence of them.    In the course of this work my reader will easily discover to whom it  is dedicated, without a more formal statement under such a heading.  The preface, which may seem out of its place, is merely such to my own  journeys. I thought it due to my readers and my predecessors in the  Australian field of discovery, that I should give a rapid epitome  (which may contain some minor errors) of what they had done, and which  is here put forward by way of introduction.    Most of the illustrations, except one or two photographs, were  originally from very rough sketches, or I might rather say scratches,  of mine, improved upon by Mr. Val Prinsep, of Perth, Western  Australia, who drew most of the plates referring to the camel  expeditions, while those relating to the horse journeys were sketched  by Mr. Woodhouse, Junr., of Melbourne; the whole, however, have  undergone a process of reproduction at the hands of London artists.    To Mrs. Cashel Hoey, the well-known authoress and Australian  correspondent, who revised and cleared my original manuscripts, I have  to accord my most sincere thanks. To Mr. Henniker-Heaton, M.P., who  appears to be the Imperial Member in the British Parliament for all  Australia, I am under great obligations, he having introduced me to  Mr. Marston, of the publishing firm who have produced these volumes. I  also have to thank Messrs. Clowes and Sons for the masterly way in  which they have printed this work. Also Messrs. Creed, Robinson,  Fricker, and Symons, of the publishing staff. The maps have been  reproduced by Weller, the well-known geographer.    (ILLUSTRATION: Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London.  \"Victoria D.G. Britanniarum Regina, 1837, Patrona.

Before narrating my own labours in opening out portions of the unknown  interior of Australia, it will be well that I should give a succinct  account of what others engaged in the same arduous enterprise around  the shores and on the face of the great Southern Continent, have  accomplished.    After the wondrous discoveries of Columbus had set the Old World into  a state of excitement, the finding of new lands appears to have become  the romance of that day, as the exploration by land of unknown regions  has been that of our time; and in less than fifty years after the  discovery of America navigators were searching every sea in hopes of  emulating the deeds of that great explorer; but nearly a hundred years  elapsed before it became known in Europe that a vast and misty land  existed in the south, whose northern and western shores had been met  in certain latitudes and longitudes, but whose general outline had not  been traced, nor was it even then visited with anything like a  systematic geographical object. The fact of the existence of such a  land at the European antipodes no doubt set many ardent and  adventurous spirits upon the search, but of their exploits and labours  we know nothing.    The Dutch were the most eager in their attempts, although Torres, a  Spaniard, was, so far as we know, the first to pass in a voyage from  the West Coast of America to India, between the Indian or Malay  Islands, and the great continent to the south, hence we have Torres  Straits. The first authentic voyager, however, to our actual shores  was Theodoric Hertoge, subsequently known as Dirk Hartog--bound from  Holland to India. He arrived at the western coast between the years  1610 and 1616. An island on the west coast bears his name: there he  left a tin plate nailed to a tree with the date of his visit and the  name of his ship, the Endragt, marked upon it. Not very long after  Theodoric Hertoge, and still to the western and north-western coasts,  "]]]
