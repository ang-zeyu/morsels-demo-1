BURTON          TO  THE HONORABLE  JAMES GRANT LUMSDEN,  MEMBER OF COUNCIL, ETC. ETC. BOMBAY.      I have ventured, my dear Lumsden, to address you in, and inscribe to you,  these pages. Within your hospitable walls my project of African travel was  matured, in the fond hope of submitting, on return, to your friendly  criticism, the record of adventures in which you took so warm an interest.  Dis aliter visum! Still I would prove that my thoughts are with you, and  thus request you to accept with your wonted _bonhommie_ this feeble token  of a sincere good will.          PREFACE.      Averse to writing, as well as to reading, diffuse Prolegomena, the author  finds himself compelled to relate, at some length, the circumstances which  led to the subject of these pages.    In May 1849, the late Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm, formerly  Superintendent of the Indian Navy, in conjunction with Mr. William John  Hamilton, then President of the Royal Geographical Society of Great  Britain, solicited the permission of the Court of Directors of the  Honorable East India Company to ascertain the productive resources of the  unknown Somali Country in East Africa. [1] The answer returned, was to the  following effect:--    \"If a fit and proper person volunteer to travel in the Somali Country, he  goes as a private traveller, the Government giving no more protection to  him than they would to an individual totally unconnected with the service.  They will allow the officer who obtains permission to go, during his  absence on the expedition to retain all the pay and allowances he may be  enjoying when leave was granted: they will supply him with all the  instruments required, afford him a passage going and returning, and pay  the actual expenses of the journey.\"    The project lay dormant until March 1850, when Sir Charles Malcolm and  Captain Smyth, President of the Royal Geographical Society of Great  Britain, waited upon the chairman of the Court of Directors of the  Honorable East India Company. He informed them that if they would draw up  a statement of what was required, and specify how it could be carried into  effect, the document should be forwarded to the Governor-General of India,  with a recommendation that, should no objection arise, either from expense  or other causes, a fit person should be permitted to explore the Somali  Country.    Sir Charles Malcolm then offered the charge of the expedition to Dr.  Carter of Bombay, an officer favourably known to the Indian world by his  services on board the \"Palinurus\" brig whilst employed upon the maritime  survey of Eastern Arabia. Dr. Carter at once acceded to the terms proposed  by those from whom the project emanated; but his principal object being to  compare the geology and botany of the Somali Country with the results of  his Arabian travels, he volunteered to traverse only that part of Eastern  Africa which lies north of a line drawn from Berberah to Ras Hafun,--in  fact, the maritime mountains of the Somal. His health not permitting him  to be left on shore, he required a cruizer to convey him from place to  place, and to preserve his store of presents and provisions. By this means  he hoped to land at the most interesting points and to penetrate here and  there from sixty to eighty miles inland, across the region which he  undertook to explore.    On the 17th of August, 1850, Sir Charles Malcolm wrote to Dr. Carter in  these terms:--\"I have communicated with the President of the Royal  Geographical Society and others: the feeling is, that though much valuable  information could no doubt be gained by skirting the coast (as you  propose) both in geology and botany, yet that it does not fulfil the  primary and great object of the London Geographical Society, which was,  and still is, to have the interior explored.\" The Vice-Admiral, however,  proceeded to say that, under the circumstances of the case, Dr. Carter's  plans were approved of, and asked him to confer immediately with Commodore  Lushington; then Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy.    In May, 1851, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm died: geographers and  travellers lost in him an influential and an energetic friend. During the  ten years of his superintendence over the Indian Navy that service rose,  despite the incubus of profound peace, to the highest distinction. He  freely permitted the officers under his command to undertake the task of  geographical discovery, retaining their rank, pay, and batta, whilst the  actual expenses of their journeys were defrayed by contingent bills. All  papers and reports submitted to the local government were favourably  received, and the successful traveller looked forward to distinction and  advancement.    During the decade which elapsed between 1828 and 1838, \"officers of the  Indian Navy journeyed, as the phrase is, _with their lives in their  hands_, through the wildest districts of the East. Of these we name the  late Commander J. A. Young, Lieutenants Wellsted, Wyburd, Wood, and  Christopher, retired Commander Ormsby, the present Capt. H. B. Lynch C.B.,  Commanders Felix Jones and W. C. Barker, Lieutenants Cruttenden and  Whitelock. Their researches extended from the banks of the Bosphorus to  the shores of India. Of the vast, the immeasurable value of such  services,\" to quote the words of the Quarterly Review (No. cxxix. Dec.  1839), \"which able officers thus employed, are in the mean time rendering  to science, to commerce, to their country, and to the whole civilized  world, we need say nothing:--nothing we could say would be too much.\"    \"In five years, the admirable maps of that coral-bound gulf--the Red Sea--  were complete: the terrors of the navigation had given place to the  confidence inspired by excellent surveys. In 1829 the Thetis of ten guns,  under Commander Robert Moresby, convoyed the first coal ship up the Red  Sea, of the coasts of which this skilful and enterprising seaman made a  cursory survey, from which emanated the subsequent trigonometrical  operations which form our present maps. Two ships were employed, the  'Benares' and 'Palinurus,' the former under Commander Elwon, the latter  under Commander Moresby. It remained, however, for the latter officer to  complete the work. Some idea may be formed of the perils these officers  and men went through, when we state the 'Benares' was forty-two times  aground.    \"Robert Moresby, the genius of the Red Sea, conducted also the survey of  the Maldive Islands and groups known as the Chagos Archipelago. He  narrowly escaped being a victim to the deleterious climate of his station,  and only left it when no longer capable of working. A host of young and  ardent officers,--Christopher, Young, Powell, Campbell, Jones, Barker, and  others,--ably seconded him: death was busy amongst them for months and so  paralyzed by disease were the living, that the anchors could scarcely be  raised for a retreat to the coast of India. Renovated by a three months'  stay, occasionally in port, where they were strengthened by additional  numbers, the undaunted remnants from time to time returned to their task;  and in 1837, gave to the world a knowledge of those singular groups which  heretofore--though within 150 miles of our coasts--had been a mystery  hidden within the dangers that environed them. The beautiful maps of the  Red Sea, drafted by the late Commodore Carless [2], then a lieutenant,  will ever remain permanent monuments of Indian Naval Science, and the  daring of its officers and men. Those of the Maldive and Chagos groups,  executed by Commander then Acting Lieutenant Felix Jones, were, we hear,  of such a high order, that they were deemed worthy of special inspection  by the Queen.\"    \"While these enlightening operations were in progress, there were others  of this profession, no less distinguished, employed on similar  discoveries. The coast of Mekran westward from Scinde, was little known,  but it soon found a place in the hydrographical offices of India, under  Captain, then Lieutenant, Stafford Haines, and his staff, who were engaged  on it. The journey to the Oxus, made by Lieut. Wood, Sir. A. Burnes's  companion in his Lahore and Afghan missions, is a page of history which  may not be opened to us again in our own times; while in Lieut. Carless's  drafts of the channels of the Indus, we trace those designs, that the  sword of Sir Charles Napier only was destined to reveal.\"    \"The ten years prior to that of 1839 were those of fitful repose, such as  generally precedes some great outbreak. The repose afforded ample leisure  for research, and the shores of the island of Socotra, with the south  coast of Arabia, were carefully delineated. Besides the excellent maps of  these regions, we are indebted to the survey for that unique work on Oman,  by the late Lieut. Wellsted of this service, and for valuable notices from  the pen of Lieut. Cruttenden. [3]    \"Besides the works we have enumerated, there were others of the same  nature, but on a smaller scale, in operation at the same period around our  own coasts. The Gulf of Cambay, and the dangerous sands known as the  Molucca Banks, were explored and faithfully mapped by Captain Richard  Ethersey, assisted by Lieutenant (now Commander) Fell. Bombay Harbour was  delineated again on a grand scale by Capt. R. Cogan, assisted by Lieut.  Peters, now both dead; and the ink of the Maldive charts had scarcely  dried, when the labours of those employed were demanded of the Indian  Government by Her Majesty's authorities at Ceylon, to undertake  trigonometrical surveys of that Island, and the dangerous and shallow  gulfs on either side of the neck of sand connecting it with India.

CONTENTS.      TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.    KREUTZER SONATA.    IVAN THE FOOL.    A LOST OPPORTUNITY.    POLIKUSHKA    THE CANDLE.            TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.    On comparing with the original Russian some English translations of  Count Tolstoi's works, published both in this country and in England, I  concluded that they were far from being accurate. The majority of them  were retranslations from the French, and I found that the respective  transitions through which they had passed tended to obliterate many of  the beauties of the Russian language and of the peculiar characteristics  of Russian life. A satisfactory translation can be made only by one who  understands the language and SPIRIT of the Russian people. As Tolstoi's  writings contain so many idioms it is not an easy task to render them  into intelligible English, and the one who successfully accomplishes  this must be a native of Russia, commanding the English and Russian  languages with equal fluency.    The story of \"Ivan the Fool\" portrays Tolstoi's communistic ideas,  involving the abolition of military forces, middlemen, despotism, and  money. Instead of these he would establish on earth a kingdom in which  each and every person would become a worker and producer. The author  describes the various struggles through which three brothers passed,  beset as they were by devils large and small, until they reached the  ideal state of existence which he believes to be the only happy one  attainable in this world.    On reading this little story one is surprised that the Russian censor  passed it, as it is devoted to a narration of ideas quite at variance  with the present policy of the government of that country.    \"A Lost Opportunity\" is a singularly true picture of peasant life, which  evinces a deep study of the subject on the part of the writer. Tolstoi  has drawn many of the peculiar customs of the Russian peasant in a  masterly manner, and I doubt if he has given a more comprehensive  description of this feature of Russian life in any of his other works.  In this story also he has presented many traits which are common to  human nature throughout the world, and this gives an added interest to  the book. The language is simple and picturesque, and the characters are  drawn with remarkable fidelity to nature. The moral of this tale points  out how the hero Ivan might have avoided the terrible consequences of a  quarrel with his neighbor (which grew out of nothing) if he had lived in  accordance with the scriptural injunction to forgive his brother's sins  and seek not for revenge.    The story of \"Polikushka\" is a very graphic description of the life led  by a servant of the court household of a certain nobleman, in which the  author portrays the different conditions and surroundings enjoyed by  these servants from those of the ordinary or common peasants. It is a  true and powerful reproduction of an element in Russian life but little  written about heretofore. Like the other stories of this great writer,  \"Polikushka\" has a moral to which we all might profitably give heed. He  illustrates the awful consequences of intemperance, and concludes that  only kind treatment can reform the victims of alcohol.    For much valuable assistance in the work of these translations, I am  deeply indebted to the bright English scholarship of my devoted wife.          THE KREUTZER SONATA.        CHAPTER I.    Travellers left and entered our car at every stopping of the train.  Three persons, however, remained, bound, like myself, for the farthest  station: a lady neither young nor pretty, smoking cigarettes, with  a thin face, a cap on her head, and wearing a semi-masculine outer  garment; then her companion, a very loquacious gentleman of about forty  years, with baggage entirely new and arranged in an orderly manner;  then a gentleman who held himself entirely aloof, short in stature, very  nervous, of uncertain age, with bright eyes, not pronounced in color,  but extremely attractive,--eyes that darted with rapidity from one  object to another.    This gentleman, during almost all the journey thus far, had entered into  conversation with no fellow-traveller, as if he carefully avoided all  acquaintance. When spoken to, he answered curtly and decisively, and  began to look out of the car window obstinately.    Yet it seemed to me that the solitude weighed upon him. He seemed to  perceive that I understood this, and when our eyes met, as happened  frequently, since we were sitting almost opposite each other, he turned  away his head, and avoided conversation with me as much as with the  others. At nightfall, during a stop at a large station, the gentleman  with the fine baggage--a lawyer, as I have since learned--got out with  his companion to drink some tea at the restaurant. During their absence  several new travellers entered the car, among whom was a tall old man,  shaven and wrinkled, evidently a merchant, wearing a large heavily-lined  cloak and a big cap. This merchant sat down opposite the empty seats of  the lawyer and his companion, and straightway entered into conversation  with a young man who seemed like an employee in some commercial house,  and who had likewise just boarded the train. At first the clerk had  remarked that the seat opposite was occupied, and the old man had  answered that he should get out at the first station. Thus their  conversation started.    I was sitting not far from these two travellers, and, as the train was  not in motion, I could catch bits of their conversation when others were  not talking.    They talked first of the prices of goods and the condition of business;  they referred to a person whom they both knew; then they plunged into  the fair at Nijni Novgorod. The clerk boasted of knowing people who were  leading a gay life there, but the old man did not allow him to continue,  and, interrupting him, began to describe the festivities of the previous  year at Kounavino, in which he had taken part. He was evidently proud  of these recollections, and, probably thinking that this would detract  nothing from the gravity which his face and manners expressed, he  related with pride how, when drunk, he had fired, at Kounavino, such a  broadside that he could describe it only in the other's ear.    The clerk began to laugh noisily. The old man laughed too, showing two  long yellow teeth. Their conversation not interesting me, I left the car  to stretch my legs. At the door I met the lawyer and his lady.    \"You have no more time,\" the lawyer said to me. \"The second bell is  about to ring.\"    Indeed I had scarcely reached the rear of the train when the bell  sounded. As I entered the car again, the lawyer was talking with his  companion in an animated fashion. The merchant, sitting opposite them,  was taciturn.    \"And then she squarely declared to her husband,\" said the lawyer with a  smile, as I passed by them, \"that she neither could nor would live with  him, because\" . . .    And he continued, but I did not hear the rest of the sentence, my  attention being distracted by the passing of the conductor and a new  traveller. When silence was restored, I again heard the lawyer's  voice. The conversation had passed from a special case to general  considerations.    \"And afterward comes discord, financial difficulties, disputes between  the two parties, and the couple separate. In the good old days that  seldom happened. Is it not so?\" asked the lawyer of the two merchants,  evidently trying to drag them into the conversation.    Just then the train started, and the old man, without answering, took  off his cap, and crossed himself three times while muttering a prayer.  When he had finished, he clapped his cap far down on his head, and said:    \"Yes, sir, that happened in former times also, but not as often. In the  present day it is bound to happen more frequently. People have become  too learned.\"    The lawyer made some reply to the old man, but the train, ever  increasing its speed, made such a clatter upon the rails that I could  no longer hear distinctly. As I was interested in what the old man was  saying, I drew nearer. My neighbor, the nervous gentleman, was evidently  interested also, and, without changing his seat, he lent an ear.    \"But what harm is there in education?\" asked the lady, with a smile that  was scarcely perceptible. \"Would it be better to marry as in the old  days, when the bride and bridegroom did not even see each other before  marriage?\" she continued, answering, as is the habit of our ladies, not  the words that her interlocutor had spoken, but the words she believed  he was going to speak. \"Women did not know whether they would love or  would be loved, and they were married to the first comer, and suffered  all their lives. Then you think it was better so?\" she continued,  evidently addressing the lawyer and myself, and not at all the old man.    \"People have become too learned,\" repeated the last, looking at the lady  with contempt, and leaving her question unanswered.    \"I should be curious to know how you explain the correlation between  education and conjugal differences,\" said the lawyer, with a slight  smile.    The merchant wanted to make some reply, but the lady interrupted him.    \"No, those days are past.\"    The lawyer cut short her words:--    \"Let him express his thought.\"    \"Because there is no more fear,\" replied the old man.    \"But how will you marry people who do not love each other? Only  animals can be coupled at the will of a proprietor. But people have  inclinations, attachments,\" the lady hastened to say, casting a glance  at the lawyer, at me, and even at the clerk, who, standing up  and leaning his elbow on the back of a seat, was listening to the  conversation with a smile.    \"You are wrong to say that, madam,\" said the"]]]
