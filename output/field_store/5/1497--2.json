INTRODUCTION      When the first days of August loured over the world, time seemed to  stand still. A universal astonishment and confusion fell, as upon a flock  of sheep perplexed by strange dogs. But now, though never before was a  St. Lucy's Day so black with \"absence, darkness, death,\" Christmas is  gone. Spring comes swiftly, the almond trees flourish. Easter will soon  be here. Life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring  hell itself into the world, but that Nature ever patiently waits to be  his natural paradise. Yet still a kind of instinctive blindness blots out  the prospect of the future. Until the long horror of the war is gone from  our minds, we shall be able to think of nothing that has not for its  background a chaotic darkness. Like every obsession, it gnaws at thought,  follows us into our dreams and returns with the morning. But there have  been other wars. And humanity, after learning as best it may their brutal  lesson, has survived them. Just as the young soldier leaves home behind  him and accepts hardship and danger as to the manner born, so, when he  returns again, life will resume its old quiet wont. Nature is not idle  even in the imagination. It is man's salvation to forget no less than it  is his salvation to remember. And it is wise even in the midst of the  conflict to look back on those that are past and to prepare for the  returning problems of the future.    When Whitman wrote his \"Democratic Vistas,\" the long embittered war  between the Northern and Southern States of America was a thing only of  yesterday. It is a headlong amorphous production--a tangled meadow of  \"leaves of grass\" in prose. But it is as cogent to-day as it was when it  was written:        To the ostent of the senses and eyes [he writes], the influences      which stamp the world's history are wars, uprisings, or downfalls      of dynasties.... These, of course, play their part; yet, it may      be, a single new thought, imagination, abstract principle ... put      in shape by some great literatus, and projected among mankind,      may duly cause changes, growths, removals, greater than the      longest and bloodiest war, or the most stupendous merely      political, dynastic, or commercial overturn.    The literatus who realized this had his own message in mind. And yet,  justly. For those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material  comforts of his country, and ask, Are not these better indeed than any  utterances even of greatest rhapsodic, artist, or literatus? he has his  irrefutable answer. He surveys the New York of 1870, \"its facades of  marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design,\" etc., in  his familiar catalogical jargon, and shutting his eyes to its glow and  grandeur, inquires in return, Are there indeed _men_ here worthy the  name? Are there perfect women? Is there a pervading atmosphere of  beautiful manners? Are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people? Is  there a great moral and religious civilization--the only justification of  a great material one? We ourselves in good time shall have to face and to  answer these questions. They search our keenest hopes of the peace that  is coming. And we may be fortified perhaps by the following queer proof  of history repeating itself:        Never, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholster'd exterior      appearance and show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea      of caste, and on the sufficiency of mere outside      acquisition--never were glibness, verbal intellect, more the      test, the emulation--more loftily elevated as head and sample--      than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day.      The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods. The word of      the modern, say these voices, is the word Culture.    Whitman had no very tender regard for the Germany of his time. He fancied  that the Germans were like the Chinese, only less graceful and refined  and more brutish. But neither had he any particular affection for any  relic of Europe. \"Never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract  friendliness of a single _Government_ of the Old World.\" He accepted  selections from its literature for the new American Adam. But even its  greatest poets were not America's, and though he might welcome even  Juvenal, it was for use and not for worship. We have to learn, he  insists, that the best culture will always be that of the manly and  courageous instincts and loving perceptions, and of self-respect. In our  children rests every hope and promise, and therefore in their mothers.  \"Disengage yourselves from parties.... These savage and wolfish parties  alarm me.... Hold yourself judge and master over all of them.\" Only faith  can save us, the faith in ourselves and in our fellow-men which is of the  true faith in goodness and in God. The idea of the mass of men, so fresh  and free, so loving and so proud, filled this poet with a singular awe.  Passionately he pleads for the dignity of the common people. It is the  average man of a land that is important. To win the people back to a  proud belief and confidence in life, to rapture in this wonderful world,  to love and admiration--this was his burning desire. I demand races of  orbic bards, he rhapsodizes, sweet democratic despots, to dominate and  even destroy. The Future! Vistas! The throes of birth are upon us.  Allons, camarado!    He could not despair. \"Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of  the baffled?\" he asks himself in \"Drum-Taps.\" But wildest shuttlecock of  criticism though he is, he has never yet been charged with looking only  on the dark side of things. Once, he says, \"Once, before the war (alas! I  dare not say how many times the mood has come!), I too, was fill'd with  doubt and gloom.\" His part in it soothed, mellowed, deepened his great  nature. He had himself witnessed such misery, cruelty, and abomination as  it is best just now, perhaps, not to read about. One fact alone is  enough; that over fifty thousand Federal soldiers perished of starvation  in Southern prisons. Malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had  wrecked his health. During 1862-65 he visited, he says, eighty to a  hundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers, comprehending all, slighting  none. Rebel or compatriot, it made no difference. \"I loved the young  man,\" he cries again and again. Pity and fatherliness were in his face,  for his heart was full of them. Mr. Gosse has described \"the old Gray\" as  he saw him in 1884, in his bare, littered sun-drenched room in Camden,  shared by kitten and canary:        He sat with a very curious pose of the head thrown backward, as      if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than      other people do, and thus tilting his face a little upwards. With      his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of      the interlocutor he seemed to pass into a state of absolute      passivity ... the glassy eyes half closed, the large knotted      hands spread out before him. He resembled, in fact, nothing so      much as \"a great old grey Angora Tom,\" alert in repose, serenely      blinking under his combed waves of hair, with eyes inscrutably      dreaming.... As I stood in dull, deserted Mickle Street once      more, my heart was full of affection for this beautiful old man      ... this old rhapsodist in his empty room, glorified by patience      and philosophy.    Whitman was then sixty-five. In a portrait of thirty years before there  is just a wraith of that feline dream, perhaps, but it is a face of a  rare grace and beauty that looks out at us, of a profound kindness and  compassion. And, in the eyes, not so much penetration as visionary  absorption. Such was the man to whom nothing was unclean, nothing too  trivial (except \"pale poetlings lisping cadenzas _piano_,\" who then  apparently thronged New York) to take to himself. Intensest,  indomitablest of individualists, he exulted in all that appertains to  that forked radish, Man. This contentious soul of mine, he exclaims  ecstatically; Viva: the attack! I have been born the same as the war was  born; I lull nobody, and you will never understand me: maybe I am  non-literary and un-decorous.... I have written impromptu, and shall let  it all go at that."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/884"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 3 (#1)"],[1,"OF EXTRAORDINARY POPULAR DELUSIONS    Volume III    By Charles Mackay      Author Of The \"Thames And Its Tributaries,\" \"The Hope Of The World,\" Etc.      \"Il est bon de connaitre les delires de l'esprit humain.

So far, however, from being an evil, as at first  might be supposed, it has been the great civiliser of our race; and has  tended, more than anything else, to raise us above the condition of  the brutes. But the same discontent which has been the source of all  improvement, has been the parent of no small progeny of follies and  absurdities; to trace these latter is the object of the present volume.  Vast as the subject appears, it is easily reducible within such limits  as will make it comprehensive without being wearisome, and render its  study both instructive and amusing.    Three causes especially have excited our discontent; and, by impelling  us to seek for remedies for the irremediable, have bewildered us in a  maze of madness and error. These are death, toil, and ignorance of the  future--the doom of man upon this sphere, and for which he shows his  antipathy by his love of life, his longing for abundance, and his  craving curiosity to pierce the secrets of the days to come. The first  has led many to imagine that they might find means to avoid death, or,  failing in this, that they might, nevertheless, so prolong existence as  to reckon it by centuries instead of units. From this sprang the search,  so long continued and still pursued, for the elixir vitae, or water of  life, which has led thousands to pretend to it and millions to believe  in it. From the second sprang the absurd search for the philosopher's  stone, which was to create plenty by changing all metals into gold; and  from the third, the false sciences of astrology, divination, and their  divisions of necromancy, chiromancy, augury, with all their train of  signs, portents, and omens.    In tracing the career of the erring philosophers, or the wilful cheats,  who have encouraged or preyed upon the credulity of mankind, it  will simplify and elucidate the subject, if we divide it into three  classes:--the first comprising alchymists, or those in general who have  devoted themselves to the discovering of the philosopher's stone and  the water of life; the second comprising astrologers, necromancers,  sorcerers, geomancers, and all those who pretended to discover futurity;  and the third consisting of the dealers in charms, amulets, philters,  universal-panacea mongers, touchers for the evil, seventh sons of a  seventh son, sympathetic powder compounders, homeopathists, animal  magnetizers, and all the motley tribe of quacks, empirics, and  charlatans.    But, in narrating the career of such men, it will be found that many  of them united several or all of the functions just mentioned; that the  alchymist was a fortune-teller, or a necromancer--that he pretended to  cure all maladies by touch or charm, and to work miracles of every kind.  In the dark and early ages of European history, this is more especially  the case. Even as we advance to more recent periods, we shall find great  difficulty in separating the characters. The alchymist seldom confined  himself strictly to his pretended science--the sorcerer and necromancer  to theirs, or the medical charlatan to his. Beginning with alchymy, some  confusion of these classes is unavoidable; but the ground will clear for  us as we advance.    Let us not, in the pride of our superior knowledge, turn with contempt  from the follies of our predecessors. The study of the errors into  which great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be  uninstructive. As the man looks back to the days of his childhood  and his youth, and recalls to his mind the strange notions and false  opinions that swayed his actions at that time, that he may wonder at  them, so should society, for its edification, look back to the opinions  which governed the ages fled. He is but a superficial thinker who would  despise and refuse to hear of them merely because they are absurd. No  man is so wise but that he may learn some wisdom from his past errors,  either of thought or action, and no society has made such advances as to  be capable of no improvement from the retrospect of its past folly and  credulity. And not only is such a study instructive: he who reads for  amusement only, will find no chapter in the annals of the human mind  more amusing than this. It opens out the whole realm of fiction--the  wild, the fantastic, and the wonderful, and all the immense variety of  things \"that are not, and cannot be; but that have been imagined and  believed.\"          BOOK I.--THE ALCHYMISTS    OR, SEARCHERS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE WATER OF LIFE.    \"Mercury (loquitur).--The mischief a secret any of them know, above  the consuming of coals and drawing of usquebaugh!

As if  the title of philosopher, that creature of glory, were to be fetched out  of a furnace! I am their crude, and their sublimate, their precipitate,  and their unctions; their male and their female, sometimes their  hermaphrodite--what they list to style me!

For more than a thousand years the art of alchymy captivated many noble  spirits, and was believed in by millions. Its origin is involved in  obscurity. Some of its devotees have claimed for it an antiquity coeval  with the creation of man himself; others, again, would trace it no  further back than the time of Noah. Vincent de Beauvais argues, indeed,  that all the antediluvians must have possessed a knowledge of alchymy;  and particularly cites Noah as having been acquainted with the elixir  vitae, or he could not have lived to so prodigious an age, and have  begotten children when upwards of five hundred. Lenglet du Fresnoy, in  his \"History of the Hermetic Philosophy,\" says, \"Most of them pretended  that Shem, or Chem, the son of Noah, was an adept in the art, and  thought it highly probable that the words chemistry and alchymy were  both derived from his name.\" Others say, the art was derived from the  Egyptians, amongst whom it was first founded by Hermes Trismegistus.  Moses, who is looked upon as a first-rate alchymist, gained his  knowledge in Egypt; but he kept it all to himself, and would not  instruct the children of Israel in its mysteries. All the writers upon  alchymy triumphantly cite the story of the golden calf, in the 32nd  chapter of Exodus, to prove that this great lawgiver was an adept, and  could make or unmake gold at his pleasure. It is recorded, that Moses  was so wroth with the Israelites for their idolatry, \"that he took the  calf which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it to  powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel  drink of it.\" This, say the alchymists, he never could have done, had  he not been in possession of the philosopher's stone; by no other means  could he have made the powder of gold float upon the water. But we must  leave this knotty point for the consideration of the adepts in the art,  if any such there be, and come to more modern periods of its history.  The Jesuit, Father Martini, in his \"Historia Sinica,\" says, it was  practised by the Chinese two thousand five hundred years before the  birth of Christ; but his assertion, being unsupported, is worth nothing.  It would appear, however, that pretenders to the art of making gold and  silver existed in Rome in the first centuries after the Christian era,  and that, when discovered, they"]]]
