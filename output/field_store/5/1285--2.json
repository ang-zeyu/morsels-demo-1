By    Glenn D. Bradley      Author of Winning the Southwest        To My Parents          Preface      This little volume has but one purpose--to give an authentic, useful,  and readable account of the Pony Express. This wonderful enterprise  played an important part in history, and demonstrated what American  spirit can accomplish. It showed that the \"heroes of sixty-one\" were not  all south of Mason and Dixon's line fighting each other. And, strange to  say, little of a formal nature has been written concerning it.    I have sought to bring to light and make accessible to all readers the  more important facts of the Pony Express--its inception, organization  and development, its importance to history, its historical background,  and some of the anecdotes incidental to its operation.    The subject leads one into a wide range of fascinating material, all  interesting though much of it is irrelevant. In itself this material is  fragmentary and incoherent. It would be quite easy to fill many pages  with western adventure having no special bearing upon the central topic.  While I have diverged occasionally from the thread of the narrative, my  purpose has been merely to give where possible more background to the  story, that the account as a whole might be more understandable in its  relation to the general facts of history.    Special acknowledgment is due Frank A. Root of Topeka, Kansas, joint  author with William E. Connelley of The Overland Stage To California, an  excellent compendium of data on many phases of the subject. In preparing  this work, various Senate Documents have been of great value. Some  interesting material is found in Inman and Cody's Salt Lake Trail.    The files of the Century Magazine, old newspaper files, Bancroft's  colossal history of the West and the works of Samuel L. Clemens have  also been of value in compiling the present book.    G.D.B.

It was a system by means of which messages were carried swiftly on  horseback across the plains and deserts, and over the mountains of the  far West. It brought the Atlantic coast and the Pacific slope ten days  nearer to each other.    It had a brief existence of only sixteen months and was supplanted by  the transcontinental telegraph. Yet it was of the greatest importance in  binding the East and West together at a time when overland travel was  slow and cumbersome, and when a great national crisis made the rapid  communication of news between these sections an imperative necessity.    The Pony Express marked the highest development in overland travel prior  to the coming of the Pacific railroad, which it preceded nine years. It,  in fact, proved the feasibility of a transcontinental road and  demonstrated that such a line could be built and operated continuously  the year around--a feat that had always been regarded as impossible.    The operation of the Pony Express was a supreme achievement of physical  endurance on the part of man and his ever faithful companion, the horse.  The history of this organization should be a lasting monument to the  physical sacrifice of man and beast in an effort to accomplish something  worth while. Its history should be an enduring tribute to American  courage and American organizing genius.    The fall of Fort Sumter in April, 1861, did not produce the Civil War  crisis. For many months, the gigantic struggle then imminent, had been  painfully discernible to far-seeing men. In 1858, Lincoln had forewarned  the country in his \"House Divided\" speech. As early as the beginning of  the year 1860 the Union had been plainly in jeopardy. Early in February  of that momentous year, Jefferson Davis, on behalf of the South, had  introduced his famous resolutions in the Senate of the United States.  This document was the ultimatum of the dissatisfied slave-holding  commonwealths. It demanded that Congress should protect slavery  throughout the domain of the United States. The territories, it  declared, were the common property of the states of the Union and hence  open to the citizens of all states with all their personal possessions.  The Northern states, furthermore, were no longer to interfere with the  working of the Fugitive Slave Act. They must repeal their Personal  Liberty laws and respect the Dred Scott Decision of the Federal Supreme  Court. Neither in their own legislatures nor in Congress should they  trespass upon the right of the South to regulate slavery as it best saw  fit.    These resolutions, demanding in effect that slavery be thus  safeguarded--almost to the extent of introducing it into the free  states--really foreshadowed the Democratic platform of 1860 which led  to the great split in that party, the victory of the Republicans under  Lincoln, the subsequent secession of the more radical southern states,  and finally the Civil War, for it was inevitable that the North, when  once aroused, would bitterly resent such pro-slavery demands.    And this great crisis was only the bursting into flame of many smaller  fires that had long been smoldering. For generations the two sections  had been drifting apart. Since the middle of the seventeenth century,  Mason and Dixon's line had been a line of real division separating two  inherently distinct portions of the country.    By 1860, then, war was inevitable. Naturally, the conflict would at once  present intricate military problems, and among them the retention of the  Pacific Coast was of the deepest concern to the Union. Situated at a  distance of nearly two thousand miles from the Missouri river which was  then the nation's western frontier, this intervening space comprised  trackless plains, almost impenetrable ranges of snow-capped mountains,  and parched alkali deserts. And besides these barriers of nature which  lay between the West coast and the settled eastern half of the country,  there were many fierce tribes of savages who were usually on the alert  to oppose the movements of the white race through their dominions.    California, even then, was the jewel of the Pacific. Having a  considerable population, great natural wealth, and unsurpassed climate  and fertility, she was jealously desired by both the North and the  South.    To the South, the acquisition of California meant enhanced  prestige--involving, as it would, the occupation of a large area whose  soils and climate might encourage the perpetuation of slavery; it meant  a rich possession which would afford her a strategic base for waging war  against her northern foe; it meant a romantic field in which opportunity  might be given to organize an allied republic of the Pacific, a power  which would, perchance, forcibly absorb the entire Southwest and a large  section of Northern Mexico. By thus creating counter forces the South  would effectively block the Federal Government on the western half of  the continent.    The North also desired the prestige that would come from holding  California as well as the material strength inherent in the state's  valuable resources. Moreover to hold this region would give the North a  base of operations to check her opponent in any campaign of aggression  in the far West, should the South presume such an attempt. And the  possession of California would also offer to the North the very best  means of protecting the Western frontier, one of the Union's most  vulnerable points of attack.    It was with such vital conditions that the Pony Express was identified;  it was in retaining California for the Union, and in helping  incidentally to preserve the Union, that the Express became an important  factor in American history.    Not to mention the romance, the unsurpassed courage, the unflinching  endurance, and the wonderful exploits which the routine operations of  the Pony Express involved, its identity with problems of nation-wide and  world-wide importance make its story seem worth telling. And with its  romantic existence and its place in history the succeeding pages of this  book will briefly deal.          Chapter II    Inception and Organization of the Pony Express      Following the discovery of gold in California in January 1848, that  region sprang into immediate prominence. From all parts of the country  and the remote corners of the earth came the famous Forty-niners. Amid  the chaos of a great mining camp the Anglo-Saxon love of law and order  soon asserted itself. Civil and religious institutions quickly arose,  and, in the summer of 1850, a little more than a year after the big rush  had started, California entered the Union as a free state.    The boom went on and the census of 1860 revealed a population of 380,000  in the new commonwealth. And when to these figures were added those of  Oregon and Washington Territory, an aggregate of 444,000 citizens of the  United States were found to be living on the Pacific Slope. Crossing the  Sierras eastward and into the Great Basin, 47,000 more were located in  the Territories of Nevada and Utah,--thus making a grand total of  nearly a half million people beyond the Rocky Mountains in 1860.

LET the reader peruse the following story with the same spirit in which  it was written, and not conceive that it is either a pro-slavery or  anti-slavery tale. The \"peculiar institution\" which is herein  introduced, is brought forward simply as an auxiliary, and not as a  feature of the story. It is only referred to where the plot and locality  upon the slave coast have rendered this necessary, and the careful  reader will observe that the subject is treated with entire  impartiality. These few remarks are introduced, because we desire to  appear consistent. Our paper shall neither directly nor indirectly  further any sectional policy or doctrine, and in its conduct shall be  neutral, free and independent.--Editor of The Flag of our Union.          THE SEA-WITCH.      CHAPTER I.    OUTWARD BOUND.      OUR story opens in that broad, far-reaching expanse of water which lies  deep and blue between the two hemispheres, some fifteen degrees north of  the equator, in the latitude of Cuba and the Cape Verd Islands. The  delightful trade winds had not fanned the sea on a finer summer's day  for a twelvemonth, and the waves were daintily swelling upon the heaving  bosom of the deep, as though indicating the respiration of the ocean. It  was scarcely a day's sail beyond the flow of the Caribbean Sea, that one  of those noblest results of man's handiwork, a fine ship, might have  been seen gracefully ploughing her course through the sky-blue waters of  the Atlantic. She was close-hauled on the larboard tack, steering  east-southeast, and to a sailor's eye presented a certain indescribable  something that gave her taut rig and saucy air a dash of mystery, which  would have set him to speculating at once as to her character and the  trade she followed.    Few things can be named that more potently challenge our admiration than  a full-sized ship under way; her myriad of ropes, sails and  appointments, all so complete and well-controlled, the power of her  volition, the promptness with which she obeys the slightest movement of  the helm, the majestic grace of her inclination to the power of the  winds, and the foaming prow and long glistening wake, all go to make up  the charm and peculiarity of a nautical picture. There is true poetry in  such a scene as this, beauty fit to move the heart of an anchorite. No  wonder the sailor loves his ship like a mistress; no wonder he  discourses of her charms with the eloquence of true love and confiding  trust; no landsman can be more enamored of his promised bride.    But the craft to which we especially refer at the present writing, was a  coquette of the first class, beautiful in the extreme, and richly  meriting the name that her owners had placed in golden letters on her  stern--the \"Sea Witch.\" She was one of that class of vessels known as  flat upon the floor, a model that caused her to draw but little water,  and enabled her to run free over a sandbar or into an inlet, where an  ordinary ship's long boat would have grounded. She was very long and  sharp, with graceful concave lines, and might have measured some five  hundred tons. Speed had evidently been the main object aimed at in her  construction, the flatness of her floor giving her great buoyancy, and  her length ensuring fleetness. These were points that would at once have  struck a sailor's eye, as he beheld the ship bowling gracefully on her  course by the power of the trade winds that so constantly befriend the  mariners in these latitudes.    We have said that the \"Sea Witch\" was of peculiar model, and so indeed  she was. Contrary to the usual rig of what are called clipper ships, her  masts, instead of raking, were perfectly upright, for the purpose of  enabling her to carry more press of sail when need be, and to hold on  longer when speed should be of vital importance--that the straighter  construction of the masts furthers this object, is a fact long since  proven in naval architecture. She was very low, too, in her rigging,  having tremendous square yards; enabling the canvass to act more  immediately upon the hull, instead of operating as a lever aloft, and  keeping the ship constantly off an even keel. Though low in the waist,  yet her ends rose gracefully in a curve towards the terminations fore  and aft, making her very dry on either the quarter-deck or forecastle.  She might have numbered fifty men for her crew, and if you had looked in  board over her bulwarks you would have seen that her complement was made  up of men. There were none there but real able-bodied seamen--sea dogs,  who had roughed it in all weather, and on all sorts of allowance.    There was a quiet and orderly mien about the deck and among the watch,  that spoke of the silent yet potent arm of authority. The men spoke to  each other now and then, but it was in an under tone, and there was no  open levity. A few men were lounging about the heel of the bowsprit on  the forecastle, one or two were busy in the waist coiling cable; an  officer of second or third caste a quiet, but decided character, to  judge from his features, stood with folded arms just abaft the  mizzen-mast, and a youthful figure, almost too young seemingly for so  responsible a post, leaned idly against the monkey-rail, near the sage  old tar who was at the helm. At first you might have supposed him a  supercargo, an owner's son as passenger, or something of that sort, from  the quite-at-home air he exhibited; but now and then he cast one of  those searching and understanding glances aloft and fore and aft, taking  in the whole range of the ship's trim, and the way she did her duty,  that you realized at once the fact of his position; and you could not  mistake the fact that he was her commander.    He wore a glazed tarpaulin hat of coarse texture, and his dress was of  little better material than that of the crew he commanded, but it set it  somehow quite jauntily upon his fine, well-developed form, and there  was an unmistakable air of conscious authority about him that showed him  to be no stranger to control, or the position which he filled. The hair,  escaping in glossy curls from beneath his hat, added to a set of very  regular features a fine effect, while a clear, full blue eye, and an  open, ingenuous expression of countenance, told of manliness of heart  and chivalric hardihood of character. Exposure to the elements had  bronzed his skin, but there were no wrinkles there, and Captain Will  Ratlin could not have seen more than two and twenty years, though most  of them had doubtless been passed upon the ocean, for his well-knit form  showed him to be one thoroughly inured to service.    \"She does her work daintily, Captain Ratlin,\" said he who was evidently  an officer, and who had been standing by the mainmast, but now walked  aft.    \"Yes, Mr. Faulkner, 'daintily' is the word. I wish our beauty could be a  little more spunky, time is money in our business, sir,\" was the prompt  reply.    \"But the willing craft does all she can, sir.\"    \"I don't know, Mr. Faulkner, we can make her do almost anything.\"    \"But talk,\" added the mate.    \"Ay, she will do that in her own way, and eloquently, too,\" continued  his superior.    \"In coming out of Matanzas, when you made her back and fill like a  saddle horse, I thought she was little less than a human being,\" said  the mate, honestly.    \"She minds her helm like a beauty, and feels the slightest pull upon her  sheets.\"    \"I never saw a vessel lie closer to the wind,\" said the mate; \"she eats  right into it, and yet has not shaken a foot of canvass this half hour.\"    \"That is well.\"    \"It's uncommon, sir,\" continued the other.    \"She must and can do better, though,\" said the young commander, with an  air of slight impatience. \"Call the watch below, Mr. Faulkner, we will  treat our mistress to a new dress this bright day, and flatter her pride  a little; she is of the coquette school, and will bear a little  dalliance.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" responded the officer, without further parley, walking  forward to the fore hatch, and with a few quick blows with a handspike,  and a clear call, he summoned that portion of the crew whose hours of  release from duty permitted them below. The signal rang sharply through  the ship, and caused an instant response.    A score of dark forms issued forth from the forecastle, embracing  representatives from nearly half the nations of the globe; but they were  sturdy sailors, and used to obey the word of command, men to be relied  upon in an emergency, rough in exterior, but within either soft as women  or hard as steel, according to the occasion.    Now it was that an observer not conversant with the \"Sea Witch,\" and  looking at her from a distance, would have naturally concluded that she  was most appropriately named, for how else could her singular manouvres  and the result that followed be explained? Suddenly the mizzen royal  disappeared, followed by the top-gallant sail, topsail, and cross-jack  courses, seeming to melt away under the eye like a misty veil, while,  almost in a moment of time, there appeared a spanker, gaff topsail and  gaff top-gallantsail in their place, while the vessel "]]]
