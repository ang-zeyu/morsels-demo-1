CHAPTER XXX    INDIRECT EXTERNAL EVIDENCES (Continued)--AMERICAN TRADITIONS.    I.    _The Signs of Messiah's Birth._    The impressive signs given in the western world, according to the Book  of Mormon, of the birth and death of Messiah were of such a character  that they would doubtless obtain a fixed place in the traditions of  the native American people, though, as in the case of all legends, the  events are more or less distorted.    The signs of Messiah's birth, both as prophetically promised and  historically described, are as follows:        And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of      his (Messiah's) coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in      heaven insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be      no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it were      day, therefore there shall be one day and a night, and a day as if      it were one day, and there were no night; and this shall be unto      you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun, and      also if its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that      there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall      not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born. And      behold there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have      beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you. [1]        And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were      fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold at the      going down of the sun, there was no darkness; and the people began      to be astonished, because there was no darkness when the night      came. * * * * * * And it came to pass also, that a new star did      appear, according to the word. [2]    And now the native legends on this subject. From the native Central  American documents compiled and followed by Fuentes y Guzman, quoted by  Juarrors, whom Bancroft follows, it is learned that a certain Quiche  prince, Acxopil, the son of Nimaquiche, observing that his people had  greatly increased in number and influence,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#1)"],[1,"(MormonTextsProject.org), with thanks to Katie Liston and  David Cramer                THE LIFE OF    JOSEPH SMITH    THE PROPHET    BY GEORGE Q. CANNON    SECOND EDITION    Salt Lake City, Utah    1907        PREFACE.    Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet  speak. Their united voice is one of testimony, admonition and warning  to the world.    They lived men of God. They died pure and holy, sealing their testimony  with their blood.    No men ever suffered greater persecution than they: no men were ever  less understood by their generation.    It is in the hope that the Saints may find joy in reading of their  beloved Prophet and Patriarch, and that the world may judge more fairly  of these benefactors of mankind, that this book is written.    To the Author its preparation has been a loving duty. In the midst  of a somewhat busy and laborious life, he has found comfort in the  contemplation of this great subject. The closing chapters, detailing  the final sufferings upon earth of the Prophet of God and his  ever-constant brother, were finished in prison for adherence to the  principles which they taught, and for this, the Life is invested with  a dearer regard. To send the work away now is like being torn from a  beloved companion, when most the solace of his friendly presence is  needed.    In some respects this volume may be imperfect; the circumstances which  surrounded its preparation were not favorable to the collection and  arrangement of materials, but it is believed to be truthful and just.    To many friends the Author is indebted for information here embodied;  and he takes this occasion to thank them, hoping to live yet to meet  them and express his gratitude in the flesh.    That the sublime example and inspired teachings of Joseph the Prophet  of the last Dispensation, may be of eternal benefit to all who read  this Life, is the heart-felt wish of    THE AUTHOR.
