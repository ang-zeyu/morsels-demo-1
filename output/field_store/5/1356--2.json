By William Osmer    London:    Printed for T. Waller, 1756        Summary: Osmer shows us, by what he argues against, the primitive  state of horse-breeding in England where a superstitious belief in  bloodline with no attention to conformation rules. This is  difficult for the modern reader to even visualize, after the late  19th century development of conformation norms for all breeds of  animal. Notable for a description of horse raising and use among  the nomad Arabs, evidence of the survival of the ancient Nisaean  breed in Turkey, and stories of the Godolphin Arabian.      Transcriber's Note: I have retained most of the original  spellings, as it may be valuable to see how such things have  changed over the centuries. These odd spellings are marked with a  double asterisk (**) not referencing any sort of note. The use of  capitalization or all-caps is as in the original.          A DISSERTATION ON HORSES    Whoever supposes that Mess. Heber and Pond, or even Mr. John  Cheney, were the first who published accounts of Horse-racing,  will find himself much mistaken, for there lived others above a  hundred years before them, who not only published accounts of  Horse-racing, but acquainted us with the history of the wrestling,  backsword-playing, boxing, and even foot-racing, that happened in  their days; and from them we learn also who were the victors, and  how the racers came in.    Amongst these, lived a man whose name was Homer, a blind or  obscure man (for they are synonimous** terms) who occasionally  published his book of sports, and to him we are obliged also for  the pedigree of many Horses that were esteemed the best in his  time. This man was said to be poor, in little esteem, and to  travel about the country to sell his books; but though his  circumstances were very low, his understanding, it seems, was not,  for he always took care to pay his court to the great personages  wherever he came, and to flatter them in the blood of their  Horses. But though he was little esteemed in his life-time, yet  his book of pedigrees and genealogy of Horses was thought so  useful, that he was greatly honoured for it after his death. And  what is more strange, though the place of his nativity was  unknown, and no country would receive him as a member of their  community when living, yet when dead, many nations contended for  the honour of it; but whatever arguments each country may produce  for the support of its claim, nothing is more evident than that he  was an Englishman; and there is great reason to believe he was  born somewhere in the North, though I do not take upon me to say  it absolutely was so. His partiality however, to that part of the  kingdom, is manifest enough, for he pretended to say, that a good  racer could be bred in no place but the North; whereas, late  experience has proved that to be a very idle notion. But as the  northern gentlemen were the first breeders of racing Horses, so it  is very probably they were also the first subscribers to his book,  and then we shall find his partiality might arise, either from his  gratitude to these gentlemen, or from its being the place of his  nativity, or perhaps from both.    There was in the North in his time, a very famous Stallion called  Boreas: Whether the present breeders have any of that blood left,  I do not certainly know; but Homer, to flatter the owner, who was  a subscriber to his book, and always gave him two half guineas  instead of one, fabled that this same Boreas begot his colts as  fleet as the wind. This to be sure will be looked upon as nothing  more than a matter of polite partiality to his benefactor: But it  is much to be feared, this partiality has not been confined to  persons alone; for there is reason to believe, that in many cases,  he has varied the true pedigree of his Horses, and (not unlike our  modern breeders) has left out one cross that has been thought not  good, and substituted another in its room held more fashionable.    We have an account in one of his books, (I forget the year when it  was published) of a very famous chariot-race, that was run over  Newmarket between five noblemen; and though it was the custom at  that time to run with a two-wheeled chaise and pair only, instead  of four, we find all other customs nearly the same. The names of  the Horses are given us, their pedigrees, and the names of the  drivers; the course is marked out, judges appointed, betts**  offered, but no crossing or jostling allowed; a plain proof they  depended on winning from the excellence of their Horses alone. But  though a curricle and pair was then the fashion, there lived at  that time a strange mad kind of fellow, haughty and overbearing,  determined that no body should do anything like himself, who  always drove three; and though the recital of this circumstance  may be considered as trivial, or little to the purpose, we shall  find something in the story worth our attention, and with respect  to Horses, a case very singular, such a one as no history, no  tradition, nor our own experience has ever furnished us with a  similar instance of.    It seems these three Horses were so good that no Horses in the  kingdom would match them. Homer, after having been very lavish in  their praise, has given us their names, and the pedigree of two of  them, which it seems were full brothers. He tells us, they were as  swift as the wind, and in his bombast** way of writing, says they  were immortal; which expression is exactly of the same style and  meaning with our modern phrase high-bred, and could mean nothing  else, because in the recital of the pedigree, he tells us, they  were got by this same North-country Horse before mentioned, called  Boreas, and out of a flying Mare called Podarge.  But the  singularity of this case is, that the third Horse, whom he calls  Pedasus**, was absolutely a common Horse, and of no blood. Here I  beg leave to make use of Mr. Pope's words, who, in his  translation, speaking of those Horse, says thus:         \"Who like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,       \"A mortal courser match'd th'immortal race.\"    Now as nothing is more certain, than that no Horses but those of  blood can race in our days, I have long been endeavouring to find  the true reason of this singular instance, and cannot any way  account for it, but by supposing this equality of strength and  elegance might produce an equality of swiftness. This  consideration naturally produced another, which is, that the blood  of all Horses may be merely ideal; and if so, a word of no  meaning. But before I advance any thing more on this hypothesis,  and that I may not be guilty of treason against the received laws  of jockey-ship, I do here lay it down as a certain truth, that no  Horses but such as come from foreign countries, or which are of  extraction totally foreign, can race. In this opinion every man  will readily join me, and this opinion will be confirmed by every  man's experience and observation.    But in discussing this point, I shall beg leave, when speaking of  these Horses, to change the word HIGH-BRED, and in its room  substitute the word foreigner, or of foreign extraction. For  perhaps it may appear, that the excellence we find in these Horses  depends totally on the mechanism of their parts, and not in their  blood; and that all the particular distinctions and fashions  thereof, depend also on the whim and caprice of mankind.    If we take a Horse bred for the cart, and such a one as we call a  hunter, and a horse of foreign extraction, and set them together,  the meanest judge will easily point out the best racer, from the  texture, elegance, and symmetry of their parts, without making any  appeal to blood. Allow but a difference in the texture, elegance,  and symmetry of parts in different Horses, whose extraction is  foreign, this principle will be clearly proved, and the word  HIGH-BRED is of no use, but to puzzle and lead us astray: and every  man's daily observation would teach him, if he was not lost in  this imaginary error, particular blood, that, generally speaking,  such Horses who have the finest texture, elegance of shape, and  the most proportion, are the best racers, let their blood be of  what kind it will, always supposing it to be totally foreign. If I  was asked what beauty was, I should say proportion: if I was asked  what strength was, I should say proportion also: but I would not  be understood to mean, that this strength and beauty alone will  constitute a racer, for we shall find a proper length also will be  wanted for the sake of velocity; and that moreover the very  constituent parts of foreign Horses differ as much from all  others, as their performances. But this, however, will be found a  truth; that in all Horses of every kind, whether designed to draw  or ride, this principle of proportion will determine the principle  of goodness; at least to that part of it which we call bottom. On  the other hand, our daily observation will shew us, that no weak,  loose, disproportioned Horse, let his blood be what it will, ever  yet was a prime racer. If it be objected, that many a plain ugly  Horse has been a good racer; I answer that all goodness is  comparative; and that such Horses who have been winners of plates  about the country, may be improperly called good racers, when  compared to some others: but I can even allow a very plain Horse  to be a prime racer, without giving up the least part of this  system: for instance if we suppose a Horse (with a large head and  long ears, like the Godolphin Arabian) a low mean forehand, slat  sided, and goose rumped, this, I guess, will be allowed a plain  ugly Horse; but yet if such a Horse be strong, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5713"],[0,"Tales of War (#1)"],[1,"OF WAR    By Lord Dunsany      1918          The Prayer of the Men of Daleswood      He said: \"There were only twenty houses in Daleswood. A place you  would scarcely have heard of. A village up top of the hills.    \"When the war came there was no more than thirty men there between  sixteen and forty-five. They all went.    \"They all kept together; same battalion, same platoon. They was like  that in Daleswood. Used to call the hop pickers foreigners, the ones  that come from London. They used to go past Daleswood, some of them,  every year, on their way down to the hop fields. Foreigners they used  to call them. Kept very much to themselves, did the Daleswood people.  Big woods all round them.    \"Very lucky they was, the Daleswood men. They'd lost no more than  five killed and a good sprinkling of wounded. But all the wounded was  back again with the platoon. This was up to March when the big  offensive started.    \"It came very sudden. No bombardment to speak of. Just a burst of Tok  Emmas going off all together and lifting the front trench clean out of  it; then a barrage behind, and the Boche pouring over in thousands.  'Our luck is holding good,' the Daleswood men said, for their trench  wasn't getting it at all. But the platoon on their right got it. And  it sounded bad too a long way beyond that. No one could be quite sure.  But the platoon on their right was getting it: that was sure enough.    \"And then the Boche got through them altogether. A message came to  say so. 'How are things on the right?' they said to the runner. 'Bad,'  said the runner, and he went back, though Lord knows what he went back  to. The Boche was through right enough. 'We'll have to make a  defensive flank,' said the platoon commander. He was a Daleswood man  too. Came from the big farm. He slipped down a communication trench  with a few men, mostly bombers. And they reckoned they wouldn't see  any of them any more, for the Boche was on the right, thick as  starlings.    \"The bullets were snapping over thick to keep them down while the  Boche went on, on the right: machine guns, of course. The barrage was  screaming well over and dropping far back, and their wire was still  all right just in front of them, when they put up a head to look.  There was the left platoon of the battalion. One doesn't bother,  somehow, so much about another battalion as one's own. One's own gets  sort of homely. And there they were wondering how their own officer  was getting on, and the few fellows with them, on his defensive flank.  The bombs were going off thick. All the Daleswood men were firing half  right. It sounded from the noise as if it couldn't last long, as if it  would soon be decisive, and the battle be won, or lost, just there on  the right, and perhaps the war ended. They didn't notice the left.  Nothing to speak of.    \"Then a runner came from the left. 'Hullo!' they said, 'How are  things over there?'    \"'The Boche is through,' he said. 'Where's the officer?' 'Through!'  they said. It didn't seem possible. However did he do that? they  thought. And the runner went on to the right to look for the officer.    \"And then the barrage shifted further back. The shells still screamed  over them, but the bursts were further away. That is always a relief.  Probably they felt it. But it was bad for all that. Very bad. It meant  the Boche was well past them. They realized it after a while.    \"They and their bit of wire were somehow just between two waves of  attack. Like a bit of stone on the beach with the sea coming in. A  platoon was nothing to the Boche; nothing much perhaps just then to  anybody. But it was the whole of Daleswood for one long generation.    \"The youngest full-grown man they had left behind was fifty, and some  one had heard that he had died since the war. There was no one else in  Daleswood but women and children, and boys up to seventeen.    \"The bombing had stopped on their right; everything was quieter, and  the barrage further away. When they began to realize what that meant  they began to talk of Daleswood. And then they thought that when all  of them were gone there would be nobody who would remember Daleswood  just as it used to be. For places alter a little, woods grow, and  changes come, trees get cut down, old people die; new houses are built  now and then in place of a yew tree, or any old thing, that used to be  there before; and one way or another the old things go; and all the  time you have people thinking that the old times were best, and the  old ways when they were young. And the Daleswood men were beginning to  say, 'Who would there be to remember it just as it was?'    \"There was no gas, the wind being wrong for it, so they were able to  talk, that is if they shouted, for the bullets alone made as much  noise as breaking up an old shed, crisper like, more like new timber  breaking; and the shells of course was howling all the time, that is  the barrage that was bursting far back. The trench still stank of  them.    \"They said that one of them must go over and put his hands up, or run  away if he could, whichever he liked, and when the war was over he  would go to some writing fellow, one of those what makes a living by  it, and tell him all about Daleswood, just as it used to be, and he  would write it out proper and there it would be for always. They all  agreed to that. And then they talked a bit, as well as they could  above that awful screeching, to try and decide who it should be. The  eldest, they said, would know Daleswood best. But he said, and they  came to agree with him, that it would be a sort of waste to save the  life of a man what had had his good time, and they ought to send the  youngest, and they would tell him all they knew of Daleswood before  his time, and everything would be written down just the same and the  old time remembered.    \"They had the idea somehow that the women thought more of their own  man and their children and the washing and what-not; and that the deep  woods and the great hills beyond, and the plowing and the harvest and  snaring rabbits in winter and the sports in the village in summer, and  the hundred things that pass the time of one generation in an old, old  place like Daleswood, meant less to them than the men. Anyhow they did  not quite seem to trust them with the past.    \"The youngest of them was only just eighteen. That was Dick. They  told him to get out and put his hands up and be quick getting across,  as soon as they had told him one or two things about the old time in  Daleswood that a youngster like him wouldn't know.    \"Well, Dick said he wasn't going, and was making trouble about it, so  they told Fred to go. Back, they told him, was best, and come up  behind the Boche with his hands up; they would be less likely to shoot  when it was back towards their own supports.    \"Fred wouldn't go, and so on with the rest. Well, they didn't waste  time quarrelling, time being scarce, and they said what was to be  done? There was chalk where they were, low down in the trench, a  little brown clay on the top of it. There was a great block of it  loose near a shelter. They said they would carve with their knives on  the big bowlder of chalk all that they knew about Daleswood. They  would write where it was and just what it was like, and they would  write something of all those little things that pass with a  generation. They reckoned on having the time for it. It would take a  direct hit with something large, what they call big stuff, to do any  harm to that bowlder. They had no confidence in paper, it got so  messed up when you were hit; besides, the Boche had been using  thermite. Burns, that does.    \"They'd one or two men that were handy at carving chalk; used to do  the regimental crest and pictures of Hindenburg, and all that. They  decided they'd do it in reliefs.    \"They started smoothing the chalk. They had nothing more to do but  just to think what to write. It was a great big bowlder with plenty of  room on it. The Boche seemed not to know that they hadn't killed the  Daleswood men, just as the sea mightn't know that one stone stayed dry  at the coming in of the tide. A gap between two divisions probably.    \"Harry wanted to tell of the woods more than anything. He was afraid  they might cut them down because of the war, and no one would know of  the larks they had had there as boys. Wonderful old woods they were,  with a lot of Spanish chestnut growing low, and tall old oaks over it.  Harry wanted them to write down what the foxgloves were like in the  wood at the end of summer, standing there in the evening, 'Great  solemn rows,' he said, 'all odd in the dusk. All odd in the evening,  going there after work; and makes you think of fairies.' There was  lots of things about those woods, he said, that ought to be put down  if people were to remember Daleswood as it used to be when they knew  it. What were the good old days without those woods? he said.    \"But another wanted to tell of the time when they cut the hay with  scythes, working all those long days at the end of June; there would  be no more of that, he said, with machines come in and all.    \"There was room to tell of all that and the woods too, said the  others, so long as they put it short like.    \"And another wanted to tell of the valleys beyond the wood, far  afield where the men went working; the women would remember the hay.  The great valleys he'd tell of. It was they that made Daleswood. The  valleys beyond the wood and the twilight on them in summer. Slopes  covered with mint and thyme, all solemn at evening. A hare on them  perhaps, sitting as though they were his, then lolloping slowly away.  It didn't seem from the way he told of those old valleys that he  thought they could ever be to other folk what they were to the  Daleswood men in the days he remembered. He spoke of them as though  there were something in them, besides the mint and the thyme and the"]]]
