Waverley embraced the age of our fathers, Guy Mannering that of our own  youth, and the Antiquary refers to the last ten years of the eighteenth  century. I have, in the two last narratives especially, sought my  principal personages in the class of society who are the last to feel  the influence of that general polish which assimilates to each other the  manners of different nations. Among the same class I have placed some  of the scenes in which I have endeavoured to illustrate the operation of  the higher and more violent passions; both because the lower orders are  less restrained by the habit of suppressing their feelings, and because  I agree, with my friend Wordsworth, that they seldom fail to express  them in the strongest and most powerful language. This is, I think,  peculiarly the case with the peasantry of my own country, a class with  whom I have long been familiar. The antique force and simplicity  of their language, often tinctured with the Oriental eloquence of  Scripture, in the mouths of those of an elevated understanding, give  pathos to their grief, and dignity to their resentment.    I have been more solicitous to describe manners minutely than to arrange  in any case an artificial and combined narrative, and have but to regret  that I felt myself unable to unite these two requisites of a good Novel.    The knavery of the adept in the following sheets may appear forced  and improbable; but we have had very late instances of the force of  superstitious credulity to a much greater extent, and the reader may be  assured, that this part of the narrative is founded on a fact of actual  occurrence.    I have now only to express my gratitude to the Public for the  distinguished reception which, they have given to works, that have  little more than some truth of colouring to recommend them, and to take  my respectful leave, as one who is not likely again to solicit their  favour.      To the above advertisement, which was prefixed to the first edition  of the Antiquary, it is necessary in the present edition to add a  few words, transferred from the Introduction to the Chronicles of the  Canongate, respecting the character of Jonathan Oldbuck.    \"I may here state generally, that although I have deemed historical  personages free subjects of delineation, I have never on any occasion  violated the respect due to private life. It was indeed impossible that  traits proper to persons, both living and dead, with whom I have had  intercourse in society, should not have risen to my pen in such works  as Waverley, and those which followed it. But I have always studied to  generalise the portraits, so that they should still seem, on the whole,  the productions of fancy, though possessing some resemblance to real  individuals. Yet I must own my attempts have not in this last particular  been uniformly successful. There are men whose characters are so  peculiarly marked, that the delineation of some leading and principal  feature, inevitably places the whole person before you in his  individuality. Thus the character of Jonathan Oldbuck in the Antiquary,  was partly founded on that of an old friend of my youth, to whom I am  indebted for introducing me to Shakspeare, and other invaluable favours;  but I thought I had so completely disguised the likeness, that it could  not be recognised by any one now alive. I was mistaken, however, and  indeed had endangered what I desired should be considered as a secret;  for I afterwards learned that a highly respectable gentleman, one of the  few surviving friends of my father, and an acute critic, had said, upon  the appearance of the work, that he was now convinced who was the author  of it, as he recognised, in the Antiquary, traces of the character of a  very intimate friend* of my father's family.\"    * [The late George Constable of Wallace Craigie, near Dundee.]    I have only farther to request the reader not to suppose that my late  respected friend resembled Mr. Oldbuck, either in his pedigree, or the  history imputed to the ideal personage. There is not a single incident  in the Novel which is borrowed from his real circumstances, excepting  the fact that he resided in an old house near a flourishing seaport, and  that the author chanced to witness a scene betwixt him and the female  proprietor of a stage-coach, very similar to that which commences the  history of the Antiquary. An excellent temper, with a slight degree of  subacid humour; learning, wit, and drollery, the more poignant that  they were a little marked by the peculiarities of an old bachelor; a  soundness of thought, rendered more forcible by an occasional quaintness  of expression, were, the author conceives, the only qualities in which  the creature of his imagination resembled his benevolent and excellent  old friend.    The prominent part performed by the Beggar in the following narrative,  induces the author to prefix a few remarks of that character, as it  formerly existed in Scotland, though it is now scarcely to be traced.    Many of the old Scottish mendicants were by no means to be confounded  with the utterly degraded class of beings who now practise that  wandering trade. Such of them as were in the habit of travelling through  a particular district, were usually well received both in the farmer's  ha', and in the kitchens of the country gentlemen. Martin, author of  the Reliquiae Divi Sancti Andreae, written in 1683, gives the following  account of one class of this order of men in the seventeenth century,  in terms which would induce an antiquary like Mr. Oldbuck to regret its  extinction. He conceives them to be descended from the ancient bards,  and proceeds:--\"They are called by others, and by themselves,  Jockies, who go about begging; and use still to recite the Sloggorne  (gathering-words or war-cries) of most of the true ancient surnames  of Scotland, from old experience and observation. Some of them I have  discoursed, and found to have reason and discretion. One of them told  me there were not now above twelve of them in the whole isle; but he  remembered when they abounded, so as at one time he was one of five that  usually met at St. Andrews.\"    The race of Jockies (of the above description) has, I suppose, been long  extinct in Scotland; but the old remembered beggar, even in my own time,  like the Baccoch, or travelling cripple of Ireland, was expected to  merit his quarters by something beyond an exposition of his distresses.  He was often a talkative, facetious fellow, prompt at repartee, and not  withheld from exercising his powers that way by any respect of persons,  his patched cloak giving him the privilege of the ancient jester. To  be a gude crack, that is, to possess talents for conversation, was  essential to the trade of a \"puir body\" of the more esteemed class; and  Burns, who delighted in the amusement their discourse afforded, seems to  have looked forward with gloomy firmness to the possibility of himself  becoming one day or other a member of their itinerant society. In his  poetical works, it is alluded to so often, as perhaps to indicate that  he considered the consummation as not utterly impossible. Thus in the  fine dedication of his works to Gavin Hamilton, he says,--                         And when I downa yoke a naig,                      Then, Lord be thankit, I can beg.    Again, in his Epistle to Davie, a brother Poet, he states, that in their  closing career--                         The last o't, the warst o't,                           Is only just to beg.    And after having remarked, that                      To lie in kilns and barns at e'en,                    When banes are crazed and blude is thin,    Is doubtless great distress; the bard reckons up, with true poetical  spirit, the free enjoyment of the beauties of nature, which might  counterbalance the hardship and uncertainty of the life, even of  a mendicant. In one of his prose letters, to which I have lost the  reference, he details this idea yet more seriously, and dwells upon it,  as not ill adapted to his habits and powers.    As the life of a Scottish mendicant of the eighteenth century seems to  have been contemplated without much horror by Robert Burns, the author  can hardly have erred in giving to Edie Ochiltree something of poetical  character and personal dignity, above the more abject of his miserable "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by Karl Hagen, Charles Franks,  and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.          ** Transcriber's Notes **    Underscores mark italics; words enclosed in +pluses+ represent boldface;  words enclosed in /slashes/ represent underlined words.

PREFACE.    The plan of \"Graded and Higher Lessons in English\" will perhaps be better  understood if we first speak of two classes of text-books with which this  course is brought into competition.    +Method of One Class of Text-books+.--In one class are those that aim  chiefly to present a course of technical grammar in the order of  Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody. These books give large space  to grammatical Etymology, and demand much memorizing of definitions, rules,  declensions, and conjugations, and much formal word parsing,--work of which  a considerable portion is merely the invention of grammarians, and has  little value in determining the pupil's use of language or in developing  his reasoning faculties. This is a revival of the long-endured, unfruitful,  old-time method.    +Method of Another Class of Text-books+.--In another class are those that  present a miscellaneous collection of lessons in Composition, Spelling,  Pronunciation, Sentence-analysis, Technical Grammar, and General  Information, without unity or continuity. The pupil who completes these  books will have gained something by practice and will have picked up some  scraps of knowledge; but his information will be vague and disconnected,  and he will have missed that mental training which it is the aim of a good  text-book to afford. A text-book is of value just so far as it presents a  clear, logical development of its subject. It must present its science or  its art as a natural growth, otherwise there is no apology for its being.    +The Study of the Sentence for the Proper Use of Words+.--It is the plan of  this course to trace with easy steps the natural development of the  sentence, to consider the leading facts first and then to descend to the  details. To begin with the parts of speech is to begin with details and to  disregard the higher unities, without which the details are scarcely  intelligible. The part of speech to which a word belongs is determined only  by its function in the sentence, and inflections simply mark the offices  and relations of words. Unless the pupil has been systematically trained to  discover the functions and relations of words as elements of an organic  whole, his knowledge of the parts of speech is of little value. It is not  because he cannot conjugate the verb or decline the pronoun that he falls  into such errors as \"How many sounds _have_ each of the vowels?\" \"Five  years' interest _are_ due.\" \"She is older than _me_.\" He probably would not  say \"each _have_,\" \"interest _are_,\" \"_me_ am.\" One thoroughly familiar  with the structure of the sentence will find little trouble in using  correctly the few inflectional forms in English.    +The Study of the Sentence for the Laws of Discourse+.--Through the study  of the sentence we not only arrive at an intelligent knowledge of the parts  of speech and a correct use of grammatical forms, but we discover the laws  of discourse in general. In the sentence the student should find the law of  unity, of continuity, of proportion, of order. All good writing consists of  good sentences properly joined. Since the sentence is the foundation or  unit of discourse, it is all-important that the pupil should know the  sentence. He should be able to put the principal and the subordinate parts  in their proper relation; he should know the exact function of every  element, its relation to other elements and its relation to the whole. He  should know the sentence as the skillful engineer knows his engine, that,  when there is a disorganization of parts, he may at once find the  difficulty and the remedy for it.    +The Study of the Sentence for the Sake of Translation+.--The laws of  thought being the same for all nations, the logical analysis of the  sentence is the same for all languages. When a student who has acquired a  knowledge of the English sentence comes to the translation of a foreign  language, he finds his work greatly simplified. If in a sentence of his own  language he sees only a mass of unorganized words, how much greater must be  his confusion when this mass of words is in a foreign tongue! A study of  the parts of speech is a far less important preparation for translation,  since the declensions and conjugations in English do not conform to those  of other languages. Teachers of the classics and of modern languages are  beginning to appreciate these facts.    +The Study of the Sentence for Discipline+.--As a means of discipline  nothing can compare with a training in the logical analysis of the  sentence. To study thought through its outward form, the sentence, and to  discover the fitness of the different parts of the expression to the parts  of the thought, is to learn to think. It has been noticed that pupils  thoroughly trained in the analysis and the construction of sentences come  to their other studies with a decided advantage in mental power. These  results can be obtained only by systematic and persistent work. Experienced  teachers understand that a few weak lessons on the sentence at the  beginning of a course and a few at the end can afford little discipline and  little knowledge that will endure, nor can a knowledge of the sentence be  gained by memorizing complicated rules and labored forms of analysis. To  compel a pupil to wade through a page or two of such bewildering terms as  \"complex adverbial element of the second class\" and \"compound prepositional  adjective phrase,\" in order to comprehend a few simple functions, is  grossly unjust; it is a substitution of form for content, of words for  ideas.    +Subdivisions and Modifications after the Sentence+.--Teachers familiar  with text books that group all grammatical instruction around the eight  parts of speech, making eight independent units, will not, in the following  lessons, find everything in its accustomed place. But, when it is  remembered that the thread of connection unifying this work is"]]]
