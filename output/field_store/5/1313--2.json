I've been working too  hard, that's a fact.  I need a vacation, and maybe a good baseball  game----\"    He stopped and looked at the magazine he had so hastily slapped down.  Something he had read in it seemed to fascinate him.    \"I wonder if it can possibly be true,\" he went on.  \"It sounds like the  wildest dream of a professional sleep-walker; and yet, when I stop to  think, it isn't much worse than some of the things we've gone through  with, Ned.\"    \"Say, for the love of rice-pudding! will you get down to brass tacks  and strike a trial balance?  What are you talking of, anyhow?  Is it a  joke?\"    \"A joke?\"    \"Yes.  What you just read in that magazine which seems to cause you so  much excitement.\"    \"Well, it may be a joke; and yet the professor seems very much in  earnest about it,\" replied Tom.  \"It certainly is one wonderful story!\"    \"So you said before.  Come on--the 'fillium' is busted.  Splice it, or  else put in a new reel and on with the show.  I'd like to know what's  doing.  What professor are you talking of?\"    \"Professor Swyington Bumper.\"    \"Swyington Bumper?\" and Ned's voice showed that his memory was a bit  hazy.    \"Yes.  You ought to remember him.  He was on the steamer when I went  down to Peru to help the Titus Brothers dig the big tunnel.  That  plotter Waddington, or some of his tools, dropped a bomb where it might  have done us some injury, but Professor Bumper, who was a fellow  passenger, on his way to South America to look for the lost city of  Pelone, calmly picked up the bomb, plucked out the fuse, and saved us  from bad injuries, if not death.  And he was as cool about it as an  ice-cream cone.  Surely you remember!\"    \"Swyington Bumper! Oh, yes, now I remember him,\" said Ned Newton.  \"But  what has he got to do with a wonderful story?  Has he written more  about the lost city of Pelone?  If he has I don't see anything so very  wonderful in that.\"    \"There isn't,\" agreed Tom.  \"But this isn't that,\" and Tom picked up  the magazine and leafed it to find the article he had been reading.    \"Let's have a look at it,\" suggested Ned.  \"You act as though you might  be vitally interested in it.  Maybe you're thinking of joining forces  with the professor again, as you did when you dug the big tunnel.\"    \"Oh, no.  I haven't any such idea,\" Tom said.  \"I've got enough work  laid out now to keep me in Shopton for the next year.  I have no notion  of going anywhere with Professor Bumper.  Yet I can't help being  impressed by this,\" and, having found the article in the magazine to  which he referred, he handed it to his chum.    \"Why, it's by Bumper himself!\" exclaimed Ned.    \"Yes.  Though there's nothing remarkable in that, seeing that he is  constantly contributing articles to various publications or writing  books.  It's the story itself that's so wonderful.  To save you the  trouble of wading through a lot of scientific detail, which I know you  don't care about, I'll tell you that the story is about a queer idol of  solid gold, weighing many pounds, and, in consequence, of great value.\"    \"Of solid gold you say?\" asked Ned eagerly.    \"That's it.  Got on your banking air already,\" Tom laughed.  \"To sum it  up for you--notice I use the word 'sum,' which is very appropriate for  a bank--the professor has got on the track of another lost or hidden  city.  This one, the name of which doesn't appear, is in the Copan  valley of Honduras, and----\"    \"Copan,\" interrupted Ned.  \"It sounds like the name of some new floor  varnish.\"    \"Well, it isn't, though it might be,\" laughed Tom.  \"Copan is a city,  in the Department of Copan, near the boundary between Honduras and  Guatemala.  A fact I learned from the article and not because I  remembered my geography.\"    \"I was going to say,\" remarked Ned with a smile, \"that you were coming  it rather strong on the school-book stuff.\"    \"Oh, it's all plainly written down there,\" and Tom waved toward the  magazine at which Ned was looking.  \"As you'll see, if you take the  trouble to go through it, as I did, Copan is, or maybe was, for all I  know, one of the most important centers of the Mayan civilization.\"    \"What's Mayan?\" asked Ned.  \"You see I'm going to imbibe my information  by the deductive rather than the excavative process,\" he added with a  laugh.    \"I see,\" laughed Tom.  \"Well, Mayan refers to the Mayas, an aboriginal  people of Yucatan.  The Mayas had a peculiar civilization of their own,  thousands of years ago, and their calendar system was so involved----\"    \"Never mind about dates,\" again interrupted Ned.  \"Get down to brass  tacks.  I'm willing to take your word for it that there's a Copan  valley in Honduras.  But what has your friend Professor Bumper to do  with it?\"    \"This.  He has come across some old manuscripts, or ancient document  records, referring to this valley, and they state, according to this  article he has written for the magazine, that somewhere in the valley  is a wonderful city, traces of which have been found twenty to forty  feet below the surface, on which great trees are growing, showing that  the city was covered hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago.\"    \"But where does the idol of gold come in?\"    \"I'm coming to that,\" said Tom.  \"Though, if Professor Bumper has his  way, the idol will be coming out instead of coming in.\"    \"You mean he wants to get it and take it away from the Copan valley,  Tom?\"    \"That's it, Ned.  It has great value not only from the amount of pure  gold that is in it, but as an antique.  I fancy the professor is more  interested in that aspect of it.  But he's written a wonderful story,  telling how he happened to come across the ancient manuscripts in the  tomb of some old Indian whose mummy he unearthed on a trip to Central  America.    \"Then he tells of the trouble he had in discovering how to solve the  key to the translation code; but when he did, he found a great story  unfolded to him.    \"This story has to do with the hidden city, and tells of the ancient  civilization of those who lived in the Copan valley thousands of years  ago.  The people held this idol of gold to be their greatest treasure,  and they put to death many of other tribes who sought to steal it.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Ned.  \"That IS some yarn.  But what is Professor  Bumper going to do about it?\"    \"I don't know.  The article seems to be written with an idea of  interesting scientists and research societies, so that they will raise  money to conduct a searching expedition.    \"Perhaps by this time the party may be organized--this magazine is  several months old.  I have been so busy on my stabilizer patent that I  haven't kept up with current literature.

The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci    Volume 1    Translated by Jean Paul Richter    1888              PREFACE.            A singular fatality has ruled the destiny of nearly all the most  famous of Leonardo da Vinci's works. Two of the three most important  were never completed, obstacles having arisen during his life-time,  which obliged him to leave them unfinished; namely the Sforza  Monument and the Wall-painting of the Battle of Anghiari, while the  third--the picture of the Last Supper at Milan--has suffered  irremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to  which it was recklessly subjected during the XVIIth and XVIIIth  centuries. Nevertheless, no other picture of the Renaissance has  become so wellknown and popular through copies of every description.    Vasari says, and rightly, in his Life of Leonardo, \"that he laboured  much more by his word than in fact or by deed\", and the biographer  evidently had in his mind the numerous works in Manuscript which  have been preserved to this day. To us, now, it seems almost  inexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts  should have remained so long unpublished, and indeed forgotten. It  is certain that during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries their  exceptional value was highly appreciated. This is proved not merely  by the prices which they commanded, but also by the exceptional  interest which has been attached to the change of ownership of  merely a few pages of Manuscript.    That, notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the Manuscripts,  their contents remained a mystery, can only be accounted for by the  many and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them.  The handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable  practice to read even a few detached phrases, much more to solve  with any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative  readings, and to master the sense as a connected whole. Vasari  observes with reference to Leonardos writing: \"he wrote backwards,  in rude characters, and with the left hand, so that any one who is  not practised in reading them, cannot understand them\". The aid of a  mirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only  for a first experimental reading. Speaking from my own experience,  the persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be  practically advisable, considering the enormous mass of Manuscripts  to be deciphered. And as, after all, Leonardo's handwriting runs  backwards just as all Oriental character runs backwards--that is  to say from right to left--the difficulty of reading direct from the  writing is not insuperable. This obvious peculiarity in the writing  is not, however, by any means the only obstacle in the way of  mastering the text. Leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to  himself; he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into  one long one, or, again, he would quite arbitrarily divide a long  word into two separate halves; added to this there is no punctuation  whatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences,  nor are there any accents--and the reader may imagine that such  difficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a  desperate one to a beginner. It is therefore not surprising that the  good intentions of some of Leonardo s most reverent admirers should  have failed.    Leonardos literary labours in various departments both of Art and of  Science were those essentially of an enquirer, hence the analytical  method is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations  and dissertations. The vast structure of his scientific theories is  consequently built up of numerous separate researches, and it is  much to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged  them. His love for detailed research--as it seems to me--was the  reason that in almost all the Manuscripts, the different paragraphs  appear to us to be in utter confusion; on one and the same page,  observations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other  without any connection. A page, for instance, will begin with some  principles of astronomy, or the motion of the earth; then come the  laws of sound, and finally some precepts as to colour. Another page  will begin with his investigations on the structure of the  intestines, and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations  of poetry to painting; and so forth.    Leonardo himself lamented this confusion, and for that reason I do  not think that the publication of the texts in the order in which  they occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions. No  reader could find his way through such a labyrinth; Leonardo himself  could not have done it.    Added to this, more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages  which now remain to us, are written on loose leaves, and at present  arranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of  the collector who first brought them together to make volumes of  more or less extent. Nay, even in the volumes, the pages of which  were numbered by Leonardo himself, their order, so far as the  connection of the texts was concerned, was obviously a matter of  indifference to him. The only point he seems to have kept in view,  when first writing down his notes, was that each observation should  be complete to the end on the page on which it was begun. The  exceptions to this rule are extremely few, and it is certainly  noteworthy that we find in such cases, in bound volumes with his  numbered pages, the written observations: \"turn over\", \"This is the  continuation of the previous page\", and the like. Is not this  sufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that  the writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected, when  he should, at last, carry out the often planned arrangement of his  writings?    What this final arrangement was to be, Leonardo has in most cases  indicated with considerable completeness. In other cases this  authoritative clue is wanting, but the difficulties arising from  this are not insuperable; for, as the subject of the separate  paragraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself, it is  quite possible to construct a well-planned whole, out of the  scattered materials of his scientific system, and I may venture to  state that I have devoted especial care and thought to the due  execution of this responsible task.    The beginning of Leonardo's literary labours dates from about his  thirty-seventh year, and he seems to have carried them on without  any serious interruption till his death. Thus the Manuscripts that  remain represent a period of about thirty years. Within this space  of time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to  judge from it of the date of any particular text. The exact dates,  indeed, can only be assigned to certain note-books in which the year  is incidentally indicated, and in which the order of the leaves has  not been altered since Leonardo used them. The assistance these  afford for a chronological arrangement of the Manuscripts is  generally self evident. By this clue I have assigned to the original  Manuscripts now scattered through England, Italy and France, the  order of their production, as in many matters of detail it is highly  important to be able to verify the time and place at which certain  observations were made and registered. For this purpose the  Bibliography of the Manuscripts given at the end of Vol. II, may be  regarded as an Index, not far short of complete, of all Leonardo s  literary works now extant. The consecutive numbers (from 1 to 1566)  at the head of each passage in this work, indicate their logical  sequence with reference to the subjects; while the letters and  figures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original  Manuscript and number of the page, on which that particular passage  is to be found. Thus the reader, by referring to the List of  Manuscripts at the beginning of Volume I, and to the Bibliography at  the end of Volume II, can, in every instance, easily ascertain, not  merely the period to which the passage belongs, but also exactly  where it stood in the original document. Thus, too, by following the  sequence of the numbers in the Bibliographical index, the reader may  reconstruct the original order of the Manuscripts and recompose the  various texts to be found on the original sheets--so much of it,  that is to say, as by its subject-matter came within the scope of  this work. It may, however, be here observed that Leonardo s  Manuscripts contain, besides the passages here printed, a great  number of notes and dissertations on Mechanics, Physics, and some  other subjects, many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt  with by specialists. I have given as complete a review of these  writings as seemed necessary in the Bibliographical notes.    In 1651, Raphael Trichet Dufresne, of Paris, published a selection  from Leonardo's writings on painting, and this treatise became so  popular that it has since been reprinted about two-and-twenty times,  and in six different languages. But none of these editions were  derived from the original texts, which were supposed to have been  lost, but from early copies, in which Leonardo's text had been more  or less mutilated, and which were all fragmentary. The oldest and on  the whole the best copy of Leonardo's essays and precepts on  Painting is in the Vatican Library; this has been twice printed,  first by Manzi, in 1817, and secondly by Ludwig, in 1882. Still,  this ancient copy, and the published editions of it, contain much  for which it would be rash to hold Leonardo responsible, and some  portions--such as the very important rules for the proportions of  the human figure--are wholly wanting; on the other hand they contain  passages which, if they are genuine, cannot now be verified"]]]
