Long enough, O women of America, have your Mormon sisters been  blasphemed!    From the day that they, in the name and fear of the Lord their  God, undertook to \"build up Zion,\" they have been persecuted for  righteousness sake: \"A people scattered and peeled from the beginning.\"    The record of their lives is now sent unto you, that you may have an  opportunity to judge them in the spirit of righteousness. So shall you  be judged by Him whom they have honored, whose glory they have sought,  and whose name they have magnified.                                 Respectfully,                                                       EDWARD W. TULLIDGE.    _Salt Lake City, March_, 1877.        CONTENTS.    CHAPTER I.--A Strange Religious Epic.

REMINISCENCES    OF    JOSEPH, THE PROPHET,    AND THE COMING FORTH OF    THE BOOK OF MORMON.    BY ELDER EDWARD STEVENSON,    Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    ILLUSTRATED.    SALT LAKE CITY:    PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR.    1893.    [Image: Edward Stevenson, Born May 1st, 1820, at Gibraltar, Spain.]        PREFACE.    In presenting this pamphlet of Reminiscences to the public, the Author  desires to explain the circumstances that induced him to issue it.  While delivering a series of illustrated lectures in the various  tabernacles and public halls throughout the Territory--and which  were repeated on more than 200 different occasions--the Author was  earnestly solicited to publish the lectures, including engravings of  the paintings, in the form in which they now appear.    Having become convinced from the great interest taken in the lectures,  that they were productive of much good, the Author finally determined  to submit the lectures to the public.    The Author having been personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph  Smith, and having been with him in many of his trying experiences,  desires to add his testimony to the truth of the work inaugurated by  him, under instructions from the Almighty, and hopes that the incidents  herein related will induce many to investigate this great and important  work; for he that judgeth without investigation is unwise.    Respectfully, THE AUTHOR.        REMINISCENCES OF JOSEPH THE PROPHET      CHAPTER I.    The Mighty Messenger of the Latter-day Dispensation.--A Brief Record of  a Life fraught with Matchless Heroism, under all manner of Persecution,  Trials, Imprisonment, Hardships and finally Martyrdom.    [Image: Joseph Smith, the Prophet.]    The picture herewith presented is one of the few produced of the  Prophet Joseph Smith. It is here reproduced from one published in  Harper's Pictorial many years ago and now makes its appearance for  the second time. Although it is only a wood cut, there are in it some  true lines and features of the Prophet when he was about the age of  twenty-six. At this early period the science of photography was but  in its infancy and pictures of prominent men were neither so correct  nor plentiful as at the present time. It is, indeed, very proper and  desirable to preserve the best pictures of those who have proven  themselves the benefactors of our country, and more especially so of  him who was chosen and ordained of God to give light and truth and  eternal blessings to mankind.    Of the few likenesses of our martyred Prophet placed before the public,  there has been one presented by his son (Joseph Smith, Jr.), which  purports to be a copy or fac simile of a painting which was evidently  taken when he was quite young. It is a front view and, in some  respects, bears a striking resemblance to the one we present to our  readers, notwithstanding that ours is a side view.    Many efforts have been made to obtain a good portrait, but, it is to be  regretted, without satisfactory results. Brother Nathan T. Porter, of  Centerville, Davis County, Utah, who first saw Joseph Smith in Jackson  County, Mo., in the year 1831, is very much pleased with this picture,  and so also is Aunt Zina D. H. Young, who sees in it many striking  features of the youthful Prophet.    I first saw him in 1834 at Pontiac and the impression made upon my  mind by him at that time causes me now much pleasure in presenting the  picture to his many friends. The love for him, as a true Prophet of  God, was indelibly impressed upon my mind, and has always been with me  from that time, although nearly sixty years have since passed away.    In that same year, 1834, in the midst of many large congregations, the  Prophet testified with great power concerning the visit of the Father  and the Son, and the conversation he had with them. Never before did  I feel such power as was manifested on these occasions, and, although  only a small percentage of those who saw and heard him accepted the  restored Gospel, there was not one who dared to dispute it. Many of  our neighbors were heard to say: \"Well, if Mormonism is true, it will  stand; if not true, it will fall.\" Many of them lived to see it stand  and increase, and while they themselves passed away in death's embrace,  the work continued to flourish and prosper.    The fact that so few received his testimony caused me, for a time, to  greatly marvel. But when I looked back to the period when Jesus and  His chosen Twelve and Seventies labored, with all their might, for the  salvation of a fallen world, even with all manner of signs following  their labors, and saw how few believed in our embraced their testimony  in that day of mighty power, when even the grave was robbed of its  victims and the dead commanded to come forth and live, and that while  the dead lived the living were dead; yea, when I saw and meditated  upon these things, I became somewhat reconciled, and the words of  the Lord, through Jeremiah, recurred to my mind and I was satisfied.  The words were these, \"And I will take you one of a city, and two of  a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you pastors  according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and  understanding.\"--Jer. 3. chap. 14, 15. After these lessons I learned  that while the Gospel was free to every one, yet every one was not free  to receive the Gospel.    While thus speaking of the Prophet's visit to Pontiac, Oakland County,  Michigan (then a Territory), I cannot pass by the predictions which he  then made and which were afterwards literally fulfilled as witnessed by  myself and many others. Joseph said, \"If you will obey the Gospel with  honest hearts, I promise you in the name of the Lord, that the gifts as  promised by our Saviour will follow you, and by this you may prove me  to be a true servant of God.\"    I am, with others, a witness that these gifts did follow many in the  branch of the Church which was raised up in Pontiac. Among them were  Deacon Bent of the Presbyterian Church, who was the first one baptized  (and who afterwards became President of the High Council in Nauvoo).  His daughter Mary was the first one who spoke in tongues in this  branch. Besides Mary Curtis, Joseph Wood, Elijah Fordham and others  also enjoyed that gift. We felt that we were blessed above kings,  rulers and potentates of the earth and truly we were a happy branch of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Our souls were full of  joyous thanksgiving, and our songs of gladness rejoiced the heart by  day, dispelled the gloom of night and welcomed the coming morn. Those  only can realize our happiness and delight who sing with the soul and  understanding the beautiful song of Zion:     We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, To guide us in these latter days;   We thank Thee for sending the Gospel To lighten our minds with its   rays.    The above named Mary Curtis, who afterwards became Sister Reed, will be  remembered as the lady who spoke in tongues in the Logan Temple about  three years ago, on a fast day, and who, on that same day, after having  completed her day's work in the Temple, went home in the evening and  died. Lyman O. Littlefield, of Logan, as well as myself and my Sister  Mary Stevenson Clark, of Farmington, Davis Co., Utah, witnessed the  speaking in tongues by Mary Curtis in Michigan, sixty years ago, and  also on this occasion in Logan Temple.    These, however, were not the only blessings with which we were favored  in the Pontiac branch, for we enjoyed the presence of the venerable and  venerated father of the Prophet (Joseph Smith, Sen.), the Patriarch of  the whole Church of God on the earth. The writer was one of many who,  under his hands, received choice and rare blessings, when the power of  the Holy Ghost filled the house to such an extent that the tears flowed  down the cheeks of even those who lived and died outside of the pale of  the Church.    Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris were also heard by the  writer to testify that they, in open day, stood in the presence of  the God who ministered unto the Prophet. And indeed there was a power  accompanying these testimonies which was irresistible, and which made  deep and lasting impressions.    Although a mere humble widow's son, I felt proud and blessed of God,  when he honored us by coming under our roof and partaking of our  hospitality. Oh! how my heart swelled with delightful emotions of  heavenly love, as I selected and presented to him some of our choice  apples in exchange for the golden nuggets of celestial truth, which he  bestowed upon us as he partook of the humble but hearty hospitality  of a widow's table! We were proud, indeed, to entertain one who had  conversed with the Father and the Son, and been under the tuition of  an angel from Heaven, and who, under the immediate direction of the  Almighty, had organized the true church on the earth, after the exact  pattern of that organized by God, through Jesus Christ, eighteen  hundred years before.    In parting from under our roof the Prophet expressed a desire to have a  loan of a large English Book of Martyrs which we possessed, promising  to return it to us when he should meet us again in Zion, in the State  of Missouri, which he did, and on returning it he said, \"I have, by the  aid of the Urim and Thummim, seen those martyrs, and they were honest,  devoted followers of Christ, according to the light they possessed, and  they will be saved.\"    For the benefit of those who have not been privileged to meet our  beloved martyred Prophet, I deem it a favor to present the picture,  with the incidents here narrated, for the pleasure and consideration of  all who may peruse them.    Joseph Smith was born December 23rd, 1805, in Sharon, Windsor County,  Vermont. At about the age of eight years, he passed "]]]
