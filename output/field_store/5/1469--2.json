THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH,    K.G., ETC.,    WHOSE DEEP INTEREST IN ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH  THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE BRITISH NAVY  IS WELL KNOWN TO ALL WHO HAVE HAD  THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH HIM.      PREFACE.    STRANGE it must appear that the account of perhaps the most celebrated  and, certainly to the English nation, the most momentous voyage of  discovery that has ever taken place--for it practically gave birth to the  great Australasian Colonies--has never before been given to the world in  the very words of its great leader. It has fallen out in this wise.    After the return of the Endeavour it was decided that a full and  comprehensive account of the voyage should be compiled. COOK'S JOURNAL  dealt with matters from the point of view of the seaman, the explorer,  and the head of the expedition, responsible for life, and for its general  success. The Journals of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander looked from the  scientific side on all that presented itself to their enthusiastic  observation.    What could be better than to combine these accounts, and make up a  complete narrative from them all?    The result, however, according to our nineteenth-century ideas, was not  altogether happy. Dr. Hawkesworth, into whose hands the Journals were  put, not only interspersed reflections of his own, but managed to impose  his own ponderous style upon many of the extracts from the united  Journals; and, moreover, as they are all jumbled together, the whole  being put into Cook's mouth, it is impossible to know whether we are  reading Cook, Banks, Solander, or Hawkesworth himself.    The readers of the day were not, however, critical. Hawkesworth's book,*  (* \"Hawkesworth's Voyages\" 3 volumes quarto 1773.) which undoubtedly  contains all the most generally interesting passages of the three  writers, gave a clear description of the events of the voyage in a  connected manner, and was accepted as sufficient; and in the excitement  of devouring the pages which introduced so many new lands and peoples,  probably few wished for more, and the Journals were put away as dealt  with.    Since that time it has been on several occasions in contemplation to  publish Mr. (after Sir Joseph) Banks' Journal; but this has never been  accomplished.    Cook's Journal was in triplicate. The Admiralty Orders of the day  enjoined that the captain should keep a journal of proceedings, a copy of  which was to be forwarded to the Admiralty every six months, or as soon  after as possible. In the case of this voyage the ship was two and a half  years from England before any opportunity of sending this copy occurred.  The ship was the whole of this time in new and savage lands. When Batavia  was reached the duplicate of Cook's Journal was sent home, and six months  later, when the ship arrived in England, the full Journal of the voyage  was deposited at the Admiralty.    The Secretary of the Admiralty, Sir Philip Stephens, a personal friend  and appreciator of Cook, appears to have appropriated the Batavia  duplicate, as we find it in the hands of his descendants, and passing  thence by sale, first to Mr. Cosens in 1868, and then in 1890 to Mr. John  Corner.    The other and complete copy is still in possession of the Admiralty,  though in some unexplained manner it was absent for some years, and was  only recovered by the exertions of Mr. W. Blakeney, R.N.    A third copy of the Journal also terminates a few days before reaching  Batavia. It is in the possession of Her Majesty the Queen, and from its  appearance was kept for, and probably presented to, George III, who took  great interest in the voyage.    Neither private possessors nor the Admiralty have felt moved to publish  this interesting document until Mr. Corner acquired his copy, when, being  an enthusiastic admirer of Captain Cook, he determined to do so, and was  making preliminary arrangements, when he suddenly died, after a few  hours' illness. His son, anxious to carry out his father's wishes, which  included the devotion of any proceeds to the restoration of Hinderwell  Church--the parish church of Staithes, whence Cook ran away to sea--has  completed these arrangements, and the present volume is the result.    The text is taken from Mr. Corner's copy so far as it goes, paragraphs  from the Admiralty copy, which do not appear in the former, being added,  with a notation of their source.    The last portion, from October 23rd, 1770, which is only given in the  Admiralty copy, is necessarily taken from it.    The three copies are, practically, identical, except for the period  August 13th to 19th, 1770, during which the wording is often different,  though the events are the same.    It is not very difficult to account for this.    The two first-mentioned Journals are in the handwriting of an amanuensis,  Mr. Orton, the clerk. No autograph journal is, so far as is known, in  existence, but some rough original must have been kept, as both copies  bear internal evidence of having been written up after the lapse of an  interval after the events described.    This is markedly the case in the Australian part of the Journal.    It is known that Botany Bay was at first called by Cook, Stingray Bay, on  account of the number of rays caught there; but after Banks had examined  his collection, and found all his plants new to science, Cook determined  to call it Botany Bay. It is, however, called Botany Bay from the first  in the Journals.    The name, \"New South Wales,\" was not bestowed without much consideration,  and apparently at one stage New Wales was the appellation fixed upon, for  in Mr. Corner's copy it is so called throughout, whereas the Admiralty  copy has \"New South Wales.\"    It would therefore seem that about the period of the discrepant accounts  Mr. Corner's copy was first made, and that Cook, in the Admiralty copy,  which for this part is fuller, revised the wording of his description of  this very critical portion of the voyage.    The Queen's Copy has been written with especial care, and by several  different hands. It was evidently the last in point of time.    In reading COOK'S JOURNAL of his First Voyage it must be remembered that  it was not prepared for publication. Though no doubt the fair copies we  possess were revised with the care that characterises the man, and which  is evidenced by the interlineations and corrections in his own hand with  which the pages are dotted, it may be supposed, from the example we have  in the published account of his Second Voyage, which was edited by  himself, that further alterations and additions would have been made, to  make the story more complete, had he contemplated its being printed.    This does not, however, in any way detract from the interest of a  transcript of his record on the spot; and though many circumstances  recorded in Hawkesworth, from Banks or others, will not be found, it is  probable that an exact copy of the great navigator's own impressions, and  the disentanglement of them from the other interpolated matter, will be  welcome.    In printing this Journal the only alterations that have been made are the  breaking-up into chapters, with modern headings; the addition of  punctuation; and in the form of the insertion of the daily record of  wind, weather, and position of the ship. These in the original are on the  left hand page in log form. To save space they have been placed at the  end of every day's transactions.    The eccentricities in the spelling have been preserved. A good many of  these would seem to be due to Mr. Orton, the transcriber, as Cook's own  letters are generally correct in their orthography. The use of the  capital letter was usual at the time.    References will be found to sketches and plans which have not been  reproduced.    Cook's knack of finding names for localities was peculiarly happy. Those  who have had to do this, know the difficulty. Wherever he was able to  ascertain the native name, he adopts it; but in the many cases where this  was impossible, he manages to find a descriptive and distinctive  appellation for each point, bay, or island.    He seems to have kept these names very much to himself, as it is seldom  the officers' logs know anything of them; and original plans, still in  existence, in many cases bear different names to those finally pitched  upon.    Cook's names have rarely been altered, and New Zealand and Australian  places will probably for all time bear those which he bestowed.    In the orthography of his native names he was not so successful. The  constant addition of a redundant \"o\" has altered many native sounds, such  as Otaheite for Tahiti, Ohwhyhee for Hawaii; while his spelling generally  has been superseded by more simple forms. This is a matter, however, in  which great difficulties are found to the present day by Englishmen,  whose language presents no certain laws for rendering any given sound  into a fixed combination of letters.    Cook's language is unvarnished and plain, as a sailor's should be. His  incidents, though often related with circumstance, are without  exaggeration; indeed if any fault is to be found, it is that he takes  occurrences involving much labour and hardship as such matters of course,  that it is not easy for the reader, especially if he be a landsman, to  realise what they really entail.

Most footnotes  are added by the editor. They follow modern (19th-century) spelling  conventions. Those that don't are Hakluyt's (and are not always  systematically marked as such by the editor). The sidenotes are Hakluyt's  own. Summarizing sidenotes are labelled [Sidenote: ] and placed before the  sentence to which they apply.

DEDICATION TO THE FIRST EDITION.    TO THE    RIGHT HONOURABLE    SIR ROBERT CECIL KNIGHT,    PRINCIPALL SECRETARIE TO HER MAIESTIE, MASTER OF THE COURT OF WARDES AND    LIUERIES, AND ONE OF HER MAIESTIES MOST HONOURABLE PRIUIE COUNSELL.    Right Honorable, hauing newly finished a Treatise of the long Voyages of  our Nation made into the Leuant within the Streight of Gibraltar, and from  thence ouer-land to the South and Southeast parts of the world, all  circumstances considered, I found none to whom I thought it fitter to bee  presented then to your selfe: wherein hauing begun at the highest  Antiquities of this realme vnder the gouerment of the Romans; next vnder  the Saxons; and thirdly since the conquest vnder the Normans, I haue  continued the histories vnto these our dayes. The time of the Romans  affoordeth small matter. But after that they were called hence by forren  inuasions of their Empire, and the Saxons by degrees became lords in this  Iland, and shortly after receiued the Christian faith, they did not onely  trauell to Rome, but passed farther vnto Ierusalem, and therewith not  contented, Sigelmus bishop of Shireburne in Dorsetshire caried the almes of  king Alfred euen to the Sepulcher of S. Thomas in India, (which place at  this day is called Maliapor) and brought from thence most fragrant spices,  and rich iewels into England: Which iewels, as William of Malmesburie in  two sundry treatises writeth, were remaining in the aforsayd Cathedrall  Church to be seene euen in his time. And this most memorable voyage into  India is not onely mentioned by the aforesayd Malmesburie, but also by  Florentius Wigorniensis, a graue and woorthy Author which liued before him,  and by many others since, and euen by M. Foxe in his first volume of his  acts and Monuments in the life of king Alfred. To omit diuers other of the  Saxon nation, the trauels of Alured bishop of Worcester through Hungarie to  Constantinople, and so by Asia the lesse into Phoenicia and Syria, and the  like course of Ingulphus, not long afterward Abbot of Croiland, set downe  particularly by himselfe, are things in mine opinion right worthy of  memorie. After the comming in of the Normans, in the yeere 1096, in the  reigne of William Rufus, and so downward for the space of aboue 300 yeeres,  such was the ardent desire of our nation to visite the Holy land, and to  expell the Saracens and Mahumetans, that not only great numbers of Erles,  Bishops, Barons, and Knights, but euen Kings, Princes, and Peeres of the  blood Roiall, with incredible deuotion, courage and alacritie intruded  themselues into this glorious expedition. A sufficient proofe hereof are  the voiages of prince Edgar the nephew of Edmund Ironside, of Robert  Curtois brother of William Rufus, the great beneuolence of king Henry the  2. and his vowe to haue gone in person to the succour of Ierusalem, the  personall going into Palestina of his sonne king Richard the first, with  the chiualrie, wealth, and shipping of this realme; the large contribution  of king Iohn, and the trauels of Oliuer Fitz-Roy his sonne, as is supposed,  with Ranulph Glanuile Erle of Chester to the siege of Damiata in Egypt: the  prosperous voyage of Richard Erle of Cornwall, elected afterward king of  the Romans, and brother to Henry the 3, the famous expedition of Prince  Edward, the first king of the Norman race of that name; the iourney of  Henry Erle of Derbie, duke of Hereford, and afterward King of this realme,  by the name of Henry the 4 against the citie of Tunis in Africa, and his  preparation of ships and gallies to go himselfe into the Holy land, if he  had not on the sudden bene preuented by death; the trauel of Iohn of  Holland brother by the mothers side to king Richard the 2 into those parts.  All these, either Kings, Kings sonnes, or Kings brothers, exposed  themselues with inuincible courages to the manifest hazard of their  persons, liues, and liuings, leauing their ease, their countries, wiues and  children; induced with a Zelous deuotion and ardent desire to protect and  dilate the Christian faith. These memorable enterprises in part concealed,  in part scattered, and for the most part vnlooked after, I haue brought  together in the best Method and breuitie that I could deuise. Whereunto I  haue annexed the losse of Rhodes, which although it were originally written  in French, yet maketh it as honourable and often mention of the English  nation, as of any other Christians that serued in that most violent siege.  After which ensueth the princely promise of the bountiful aide of king  Henry the 8 to Ferdinando newly elected king of Hungarie, against Solyman  the mortall enemie of Christendome. These and the like Heroicall intents  and attempts of our Princes, our Nobilitie, our Clergie, and our Chiualry,  I haue in the first place exposed and set foorth to the view of this age,  with the same intention that the old Romans set vp in wax in their palaces  the Statuas or images of their worthy ancestors; whereof Salust in his  treatise of the warre of Iugurtha, writeth in this maner: Sæpe audiui ego  Quintum maximum, Publium Scipionem, præterea ciuitatis nostræ præclaros  viros solitos ita dicere, cum maiorum imagines intuerentur, vehementissimè  animum sibi ad virtutem accendi. Scilicet non ceram illam, neque figuram,  tantam vim in sese habere, sed memoria rerum gestarum flammam eam egregijs  viris in pectore crescere, neque prius sedari, quàm virtus eorum famam et  gloriam adæquauerit. I haue often heard (quoth he) how Quintus maximus,  Publius Scipio, and many other worthy men of our citie were woont to say,  when they beheld the images and portraitures of their ancestors, that they  were most vehemently inflamed vnto vertue. Not that the sayd wax or  portraiture had any such force at all in it selfe, but that by the  remembring of their woorthy actes, that flame was kindled in their noble  breasts, and could neuer be quenched, vntill such time as their owne valure  had equalled the fame and glory of their progenitors. So, though not in  wax, yet in record of writing haue I presented to the noble courages of  this English Monarchie, the like images of their famous predecessors, with  hope of like effect in their posteritie. And here by the way if any man  shall think, that an vniuersall peace with our Christian neighbours will  cut off the emploiment of the couragious increasing youth of this realme,  he is much deceiued.
