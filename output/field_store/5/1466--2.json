Book 18        Job    18:001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and             that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and             eschewed evil.    18:001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.    18:001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three             thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five             hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this             man was the greatest of all the men of the east.    18:001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his             day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to             drink with them.    18:001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone             about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in             the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the             number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have             sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job             continually.    18:001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present             themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.    18:001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan             answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the             earth, and from walking up and down in it.    18:001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant             Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and             an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?    18:001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for             nought?    18:001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,             and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed             the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the             land.    18:001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and             he will curse thee to thy face.    18:001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in             thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So             Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.    18:001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were             eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:    18:001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were             plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:    18:001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they             have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only             am escaped alone to tell thee.    18:001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,             The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the             sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am             escaped alone to tell thee.    18:001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,             The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,             and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with             the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell             thee.    18:001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,             Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in             their eldest brother's house:    18:001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and             smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the             young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to             tell thee.    18:001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and             fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,    18:001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked             shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken             away; blessed be the name of the LORD.    18:001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.    18:002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present             themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to             present himself before the LORD.    18:002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And             Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in             the earth, and from walking up and down in it.    18:002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant             Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and             an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and             still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me             against him, to destroy him without cause.    18:002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all             that a man hath will he give for his life.    18:002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his             flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.    18:002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but             save his life.    18:002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote             Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.    18:002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he             sat down among the ashes.    18:002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine             integrity? curse God, and die.    18:002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish             women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of             God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job             sin with his lips.    18:002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was             come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz             the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the             Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come             to mourn with him and to comfort him.    18:002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,             they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one             his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.    18:002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven             nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his             grief was very great.    18:003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.    18:003:002 And Job spake, and said,    18:003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which             it was said, There is a man child conceived.    18:003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,             neither let the light shine upon it.    18:003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud             dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.    18:003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be             joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the             number of the months.    18:003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come             therein.    18:003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise             up their mourning.    18:003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for             light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the             day:    18:003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid             sorrow from mine eyes.    18:003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost             when I came out of the belly?    18:003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should             suck?    18:003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have             slept: then had I been at rest,    18:003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate             places for themselves;    18:003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with             silver:    18:003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants             which never saw light.    18:003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be             at rest.    18:003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of             the oppressor.    18:003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from             his master.    18:003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life             unto the bitter in soul;    18:003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more             than for hid treasures;    18:003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find             the grave?    18:003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God             hath hedged in?    18:003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured             out like the waters.    18:003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that             which I was afraid of is come unto me.    18:003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;             yet trouble came.    18:004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,    18:004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but             who can withhold himself from speaking?    18:004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened             the weak hands.    18:004:004 Thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8019"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 19: Psalms (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by David Widger   with the help of Derek Andrew's text from January 1992  and the work of Bryan Taylor in November 2002.            Book 19        Psalms    19:001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the             ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in             the seat of the scornful.    19:001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth             he meditate day and night.    19:001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,             that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also             shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.    19:001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind             driveth away.    19:001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor             sinners in the congregation of the righteous.    19:001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of             the ungodly shall perish.    19:002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?    19:002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take             counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,             saying,    19:002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords             from us.    19:002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall             have them in derision.    19:002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in             his sore displeasure.    19:002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.    19:002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou             art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.    19:002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine             inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy             possession.    19:002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them             in pieces like a potter's vessel.    19:002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of             the earth.    19:002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.    19:002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,             when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they             that put their trust in him.    19:003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they             that rise up against me.    19:003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him             in God. Selah.    19:003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the             lifter up of mine head.    19:003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of             his holy hill. Selah.    19:003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.    19:003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set             themselves against me round about.    19:003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all             mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth             of the ungodly.    19:003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy             people. Selah.    19:004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast             enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and             hear my prayer.    19:004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?             how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.    19:004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for             himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.    19:004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon             your bed, and be still. Selah.    19:004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in             the LORD.    19:004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift             thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.    19:004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that             their corn and their wine increased.    19:004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,             only makest me dwell in safety.    19:005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.    19:005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for             unto thee will I pray.    19:005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the             morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.    19:005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:             neither shall evil dwell with thee.    19:005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all             workers of iniquity.    19:005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will             abhor the bloody and deceitful man.    19:005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of             thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy             temple.    19:005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;             make thy way straight before my face.    19:005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part             is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they             flatter with their tongue.    19:005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;             cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for             they have rebelled against thee.    19:005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let             them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them             also that love thy name be joyful in thee.    19:005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt             thou compass him as with a shield.    19:006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in             thy hot displeasure.    19:006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;             for my bones are vexed.    19:006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?    19:006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'             sake.    19:006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who             shall give thee thanks?    19:006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to             swim; I water my couch with my tears.    19:006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because             of all mine enemies.    19:006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath             heard the voice of my weeping.    19:006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my             prayer.    19:006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them             return and be ashamed suddenly.    19:007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all             them that persecute me, and deliver me:    19:007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while             there is none to deliver.    19:007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my             hands;    19:007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;             (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)    19:007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him             tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the             dust. Selah.    19:007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the             rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that             thou hast commanded.    19:007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:             for their sakes therefore return thou on high.    19:007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according             to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is             in me.    19:007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but             establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts             and reins.    19:007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.    19:007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked             every day.    19:007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,             and made it ready.    19:007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he             ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.    19:007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived             mischief, and brought forth falsehood.    19:007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch             which he made.    19:007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent             dealing shall come down upon his own pate.    19:007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and             will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.    19:008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!             who hast set thy glory above the heavens.    19:008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained             strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still             the enemy and the avenger.    19:008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon             and the stars, which thou hast ordained;    19:008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,             that thou visitest him?    19:008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and             hast crowned him with glory and honour.    19:008:006 Thou madest "]]]
