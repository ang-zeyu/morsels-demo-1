H. ROBERTS_    Of the First Council of the Seventy      _To become a Seventy means mental activity, intellectual development,  and the attainment of spiritual power_    Salt Lake City    1907        _INTRODUCTION._    _To become a Seventy means mental activity, intellectual development,  and the attainment of spiritual power_.    The first three opening lessons of this year's course of study are  devoted to the history, organization and duties of the Seventy. They  should be thoroughly mastered by the present membership of the quorums,  and as fast as new members are brought in their attention should be  called to these lessons, and they be required to master them also that  all our Seventies may have a proper understanding of the dignity and  importance and the responsibility of this office in the Holy Priesthood.    The body of the present year's course of study deals with the four  books of the scriptures, recognized by the Church as the only  authoritative written embodiment of the doctrines of the Church;  namely, the Bible, comprising the Old and New Testament, the American  volume of scripture, the Book of Mormon, modern revelation, contained  in the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The year's  course of study is intended to be a rapid survey, not an exhaustive  treatment, of these books; and this in order that all our Seventies  may as soon as possible be made acquainted in a general, even if  only in a superficial way, for the present, with this body of sacred  literature; that they may know something of its history and character.  The dominating idea of the whole course being,    _A Workman Should Know His Tools_.    In the past, a too exclusive adherence to merely \"text methods\" of  work has been followed. That is to say, there has been a selection  of separate and disconnected texts marshalled together in support  of a given subject without sufficient care being taken to know the  context and historical association of the scriptural utterances, often  attended with great danger of forming misconceptions of such texts,  resulting in wrong deductions and conclusions. The present aim is to  make our Seventies familiar with the spirit of the scriptures, learning  something of the individual books, as a whole, something of their  general import and their relationship one to another; that from this  general acquaintance with the whole volume of scripture, the Seventies  may become more competent to use separate passages more intelligently  and effectively, and with less likelihood of making mistakes.    The fear has been expressed that since so many lessons are devoted to  the Bible, nearly half the years' course, there will be some danger of  the work becoming monotonous; but that fear is based upon the common  misconception that the Bible is one book, instead of a collection of  books, thirty-nine in the Old Testament and twenty-seven in the New of  our common English Bibles. Since the books are so many and the time  period covered so great--about 2500 years, from Moses to St. John--and  the books being composed by many writers--there is promise of plenty of  variety, both as to books and subject matter. It is the rapid survey of  a whole library of books that is contemplated, rather than the study  of one book, albeit the many books are bound together in one volume.  The consideration of the American volume of scripture, the Book of  Mormon, and of modern revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants and  Pearl of Great Price, in the latter part of the course, together with  the suggested lectures and the special lessons on present day subjects,  scripture reading exercises, etc., etc., will unquestionably give ample  variety to the year's work.    _THE CLASS TEACHERS_.    The First Council in its circular letter on the subject of the new  order of things in relation to Seventies' meetings, course of study,  etc., has already suggested that the new plans of Seventies' work would  make it necessary for the quorums to find the most efficient teachers  for their classes. \"Where the most efficient teachers are to be found  among the presidents of quorums,\" says the circular letter, \"of course  they will be given preference; but where more efficient men can be  found in the quorum membership they should be selected as teachers and  perform their duties under the direction of the Council of the Quorum,  which, of course, will always be the presiding authority in all quorum  and class meetings, and conduct all the exercises except the class  work. It might be well to select the most proficient man for teacher,  and appoint one or more assistants who should prepare for the class  work, and in the event of the teacher's absence, and even occasionally  when he is present, they could conduct the exercises.    _MANNER OF LESSON TREATMENT_.    It is not desired that there shall be a too slavish adherence to the  letter of the lessons. The lesson forms are merely suggestive. Nor is  it the intention to set forth a stereotyped method of treatment of  what is given. Much will depend upon the teachers. Some will prefer  to assign the whole lesson to the quorum in general and conduct the  exercises as a class; others may prefer to make special assignments of  topics from the subject matter of the lessons and have brief formal  lectures devoted to them, followed by review questions, formulated  either in advance or in the course of the lesson exercises, or at its  close by the one conducting the class. Either of these methods can be  made satisfactory, or a combination of them might be adopted. It is  desirable that the quorums and class teachers exercise their freedom in  these matters, only let them throw life and individuality into the work  and they will succeed.    The class meetings of the quorums can continue throughout the year  practically without interruption. Interruption will only be necessary  in order to attend the Stake Quarterly Conferences, and the ward  conferences where the respective quorums are located, and these  occasions will not exceed five in number. There will be no occasion for  postponing class exercises in order to attend to the business affairs  of the quorum, since half an hour of any regular session of the quorum  will be sufficient for the transaction of any business it may have to  do if prompt and business-like methods are employed. If not, a special  meeting could be called. It is expected, of course, that the council  will continue to hold its council meetings apart from the quorum and  class meetings, but these, too, could be held on the Sunday morning  either before or after the regular meeting.    _HOME READING AND PREPARATION_.    Home reading and preparation outside of class hours should be insisted  upon. It is not intended that the only mental work in connection with  our course of study shall be the two or three hours devoted to the work  on Sunday morning. There must be reading through the week. For example,  during the weeks that the Pentateuch constitutes the lessons--three in  number and hence extending over three weeks of time--it is expected  that members will read the five books of Moses through, not a difficult  task; and so on throughout all the lessons. By reading about one hour a  day an average reader may complete in one year the reading of the four  books of scripture covered by the present year's lessons. Necessarily,  this will be rapid reading, but it should be remembered that we are  only reading the scriptures this time to get a general idea of their  contents, and the relation of the parts to the whole. The object now is  not to ponder deeply over texts and combine them subjectively, or work  out doctrinal or historical themes, hence we can read rapidly in this  first survey of the scriptures proposed in these lessons. In addition  to reading the books of scripture themselves, members should consult as  far as possible the references given on the various books and topics in  the lesson analysis. These references are quite numerous and varied,  made so purposely, so that if the members do not happen to have access  to one of the Dictionaries or Helps or other works of reference, they  might possibly have another--one at least out of the many, and the  notes are given that all may be assured of some assistance in making  lesson preparations by consulting the utterances of those who are  recognized as authorities upon the subjects on which they are quoted.  If this is thought to be a rather heavy course of work let it be  remembered that it is to become a settled conviction with all that,  _To be a Seventy means mental activity, intellectual development, and  the attainment of spiritual power, and this may be done only by hard  persistent work_.    _SCRIPTURE READING AND SPECIAL TEXTS_.    At Lesson XIV, Part II, it will be observed that \"scripture reading\"  is introduced as an exercise to be rendered immediately after the  opening exercises and before taking up the lesson proper. The purpose  of this exercise is as follows: It is well known that in some Christian  families in the world, it is the custom to make the reading of the  scriptures a part of the family worship, and our Elders when visiting  in such families are called upon to read the scripture lesson before  engaging in prayer--an example that could be followed with profit  in our own family worship. The desirability of our Elders being  prepared to acquit themselves well on such occasions as named above,  is obvious, and to do that each one should have in mind a number of  suitable chapters or parts of chapters of the scriptures with which he  is familiar, which are appropriate for inspiring the true spirit of  worship, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

FIGHTING WITH WILD ANIMALS      THE CURTAIN.          PREFACE      During these days of ceaseless conflict, anxiety and unrest among  men, when at times it begins to look as if \"the Caucasian\" really is  \"played out,\" perhaps the English-reading world will turn with a sigh  of relief to the contemplation of wild animals. At all events, the  author has found this diversion in his favorite field mentally  agreeable and refreshing.    In comparison with some of the alleged men who now are cursing this  earth by their baneful presence, the so-called \"lower animals\" do not  seem so very \"low\" after all! As a friend of the animals, this is a  very proper time in which to compare them with men. Furthermore, if  thinking men and women desire to know the leading facts concerning the  intelligence of wild animals, it will be well to consider them now,  before the bravest and the best of the wild creatures of the earth go  down and out under the merciless and inexorable steam roller that we  call Civilization.    The intelligence and the ways of wild animals are large subjects.  Concerning them I do not offer this volume as an all-in-all production.  Out of the great mass of interesting things that might  have been included, I have endeavored to select and set forth only  enough to make a good series of sample exhibits, without involving the  general reader in a hopelessly large collection of details. The most  serious question has been: What shall be left out?    Mr. A. R. Spofford, first Librarian of Congress, used to declare that  \"Books are made from books\"; but I call the reader to bear witness that  this volume is not a mass of quotations. A quoted authority often can  be disputed, and for this reason the author has found considerable  satisfaction in relying chiefly upon his own testimony.    Because I always desire to know the _opinions_ of men who are  writing upon their own observations, I have felt free to express my own  conclusions regarding the many phases of animal intelligence as their  manifestation has impressed me in close-up observations.    I have purposely avoided all temptations to discuss the minds and  manners of domestic animals, partly because that is by itself a large  subject, and partly because their minds have been so greatly influenced  by long and close association with man. The domestic mammals and birds  deserve independent treatment.    A great many stories of occurrences have been written into this  volume, for the purpose of giving the reader all the facts in  order that he may form his own opinions of the animal mentality  displayed.    Most sincerely do I wish that the boys and girls of America, and of the  whole world, may be induced to believe that _the most interesting  thing about a wild animal is its mind and its reasoning,_ and that a  dead animal is only a poor decaying thing. If the feet of the young men  would run more to seeing and studying the wild creatures and less to  the killing of them, some of the world's valuable species might escape  being swept away tomorrow, or the day after.

To assume that every wild beast and bird is a sacred creature,  peacefully dwelling in an earthly paradise, is a mistake. They  have their wisdom and their folly, their joys and their sorrows,  their trials and tribulations.    As the alleged lord of creation, it is man's duty to know the wild  animals truly as they are, in order to enjoy them to the utmost, to  utilize them sensibly and fairly, and to give them a square deal.          I. A SURVEY OF THE FIELD    I    THE LAY OF THE LAND      There is a vast field of fascinating human interest, lying only just  outside our doors, which as yet has been but little explored. It is the  Field of Animal Intelligence.    Of all the kinds of interest attaching to the study of the world's  wild animals, there are none that surpass the study of their minds,  their morals, and the acts that they perform as the results of their  mental processes.    In these pages, the term \"animal\" is not used in its most common  and most restricted sense. It is intended to apply not only to  quadrupeds, but also to all the vertebrate forms,--mammals,  birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes.    For observation and study, the whole vast world of living  creatures is ours, throughout all zones and all lands. It is not  ours to flout, to abuse, or to exterminate as we please. While for  practical reasons we do not here address ourselves to the  invertebrates, nor even to the sea-rovers, we can not keep them  out of the background of our thoughts. The living world is so vast  and so varied, so beautiful and so ugly, so delightful and so  terrible, so interesting and so commonplace, that each step we  make through it reveals things different and previously unknown.    The Frame of Mind. To the inquirer who enters the field of animal  thought with an open mind, and free from the trammels of egotism  and fear regarding man's place in nature, this study will prove an  endless succession of surprises and delights. In behalf of the  utmost tale of results, the inquirer should summon to his aid his  rules of evidence, his common sense, his love of fair play, and  the inexorable logic of his youthful geometry.    And now let us clear away a few weeds from the entrance to our  field, and reveal its cornerstones and boundary lines. To a  correct understanding of any subject a correct point of view is  absolutely essential.    In a commonplace and desultory way man has been mildly interested  in the intelligence of animals for at least 30,000 years. The Cro-  Magnons of that far time possessed real artistic talent, and on  the smooth stone walls and ceilings of the caves of France they  drew many wonderful pictures of mammoths, European bison, wild  cattle, rhinoceroses and other animals of their period.
