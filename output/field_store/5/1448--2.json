THE COUNCIL OF WAYS AND MEANS    This is the story of the different ways we looked for treasure, and I  think when you have read it you will see that we were not lazy about the  looking.    There are some things I must tell before I begin to tell about the  treasure-seeking, because I have read books myself, and I know how  beastly it is when a story begins, \"'Alas!\" said Hildegarde with a deep  sigh, \"we must look our last on this ancestral home\"'--and then some one  else says something--and you don't know for pages and pages where the  home is, or who Hildegarde is, or anything about it. Our ancestral home  is in the Lewisham Road. It is semi-detached and has a garden, not a  large one. We are the Bastables. There are six of us besides Father. Our  Mother is dead, and if you think we don't care because I don't tell you  much about her you only show that you do not understand people at all.  Dora is the eldest. Then Oswald--and then Dicky. Oswald won the Latin  prize at his preparatory school--and Dicky is good at sums. Alice  and Noel are twins: they are ten, and Horace Octavius is my youngest  brother. It is one of us that tells this story--but I shall not tell you  which: only at the very end perhaps I will. While the story is going  on you may be trying to guess, only I bet you don't. It was Oswald  who first thought of looking for treasure. Oswald often thinks of very  interesting things. And directly he thought of it he did not keep it  to himself, as some boys would have done, but he told the others, and  said--    'I'll tell you what, we must go and seek for treasure: it is always what  you do to restore the fallen fortunes of your House.'    Dora said it was all very well. She often says that. She was trying to  mend a large hole in one of Noel's stockings. He tore it on a nail when  we were playing shipwrecked mariners on top of the chicken-house the day  H. O. fell off and cut his chin: he has the scar still. Dora is the only  one of us who ever tries to mend anything. Alice tries to make things  sometimes. Once she knitted a red scarf for Noel because his chest  is delicate, but it was much wider at one end than the other, and he  wouldn't wear it. So we used it as a pennon, and it did very well,  because most of our things are black or grey since Mother died; and  scarlet was a nice change. Father does not like you to ask for new  things. That was one way we had of knowing that the fortunes of the  ancient House of Bastable were really fallen. Another way was that there  was no more pocket-money--except a penny now and then to the little  ones, and people did not come to dinner any more, like they used to,  with pretty dresses, driving up in cabs--and the carpets got holes in  them--and when the legs came off things they were not sent to be mended,  and we gave _up_ having the gardener except for the front garden, and  not that very often. And the silver in the big oak plate-chest that is  lined with green baize all went away to the shop to have the dents  and scratches taken out of it, and it never came back. We think Father  hadn't enough money to pay the silver man for taking out the dents and  scratches. The new spoons and forks were yellowy-white, and not so heavy  as the old ones, and they never shone after the first day or two.    Father was very ill after Mother died; and while he was ill his  business-partner went to Spain--and there was never much money  afterwards. I don't know why. Then the servants left and there was only  one, a General. A great deal of your comfort and happiness depends on  having a good General. The last but one was nice: she used to make jolly  good currant puddings for us, and let us have the dish on the floor  and pretend it was a wild boar we were killing with our forks. But the  General we have now nearly always makes sago puddings, and they are  the watery kind, and you cannot pretend anything with them, not even  islands, like you do with porridge.    Then we left off going to school, and Father said we should go to a good  school as soon as he could manage it. He said a holiday would do us all  good. We thought he was right, but we wished he had told us he couldn't  afford it. For of course we knew.    Then a great many people used to come to the door with envelopes with  no stamps on them, and sometimes they got very angry, and said they  were calling for the last time before putting it in other hands. I asked  Eliza what that meant, and she kindly explained to me, and I was so  sorry for Father.    And once a long, blue paper came; a policeman brought it, and we were  so frightened. But Father said it was all right, only when he went up  to kiss the girls after they were in bed they said he had been crying,  though I'm sure that's not true. Because only cowards and snivellers  cry, and my Father is the bravest man in the world.    So you see it was time we looked for treasure and Oswald said so, and  Dora said it was all very well. But the others agreed with Oswald. So we  held a council. Dora was in the chair--the big dining-room chair, that  we let the fireworks off from, the Fifth of November when we had the  measles and couldn't do it in the garden. The hole has never been  mended, so now we have that chair in the nursery, and I think it was  cheap at the blowing-up we boys got when the hole was burnt.    'We must do something,' said Alice, 'because the exchequer is empty.'  She rattled the money-box as she spoke, and it really did rattle because  we always keep the bad sixpence in it for luck.    'Yes--but what shall we do?' said Dicky. 'It's so jolly easy to say  let's do _something_.' Dicky always wants everything settled exactly.  Father calls him the Definite Article.    'Let's read all the books again. We shall get lots of ideas out of  them.' It was Noel who suggested this, but we made him shut up, because  we knew well enough he only wanted to get back to his old books. Noel  is a poet. He sold some of his poetry once--and it was printed, but that  does not come in this part of the story.    Then Dicky said, 'Look here. We'll be quite quiet for ten minutes by  the clock--and each think of some way to find treasure. And when we've  thought we'll try all the ways one after the other, beginning with the  eldest.'    'I shan't be able to think in ten minutes, make it half an hour,' said  H. O. His real name is Horace Octavius, but we call him H. O. because of  the advertisement, and it's not so very long ago he was afraid to pass  the hoarding where it says 'Eat H. O.' in big letters. He says it was  when he was a little boy, but I remember last Christmas but one, he woke  in the middle of the night crying and howling, and they said it was the  pudding. But he told me afterwards he had been dreaming that they really  _had_ come to eat H. O., and it couldn't have been the pudding, when you  come to think of it, because it was so very plain.    Well, we made it half an hour--and we all sat quiet, and thought and  thought. And I made up my mind before two minutes were over, and I  saw the others had, all but Dora, who is always an awful time over  everything. I got pins and needles in my leg from sitting still so long,  and when it was seven minutes H. O. cried out--'Oh, it must be more than  half an hour!'    H. O. is eight years old, but he cannot tell the clock yet. Oswald could  tell the clock when he was six.    We all stretched ourselves and began to speak at once, but Dora put up  her hands to her ears and said--    'One at a time, please. We aren't playing Babel.' (It is a very good  game. Did you ever play it?)    So Dora made us all sit in a row on the floor, in ages, and then she  pointed at us with the finger that had the brass thimble on. Her silver  one got lost when the last General but two went away. We think she must  have forgotten it was Dora's and put it in her box by mistake. She was a  very forgetful girl. She used to forget what she had spent money on, so  that the change was never quite right.    Oswald spoke first. 'I think we might stop people on Blackheath--with  crape masks and horse-pistols--and say \"Your money or your life!  Resistance is useless, we are armed to the teeth\"--like Dick Turpin  and Claude Duval. It wouldn't matter about not having horses, because  coaches have gone out too.'    Dora screwed up her nose the way she always does when she is going to  talk like the good elder sister in books, and said, 'That would be  very wrong: it's like pickpocketing or taking pennies out of Father's  great-coat when it's hanging in the hall.'    I must say I don't think she need have said that, especially before the  little ones--for it was when I was only four.    But Oswald was not going to let her see he cared, so he said--    'Oh, very well. I can think of lots of other ways. We could rescue an  old gentleman from deadly Highwaymen.'    'There aren't any,' said Dora.    'Oh, well, it's all the same--from deadly peril, then. There's plenty  of that. Then he would turn out to be the Prince of Wales, and he would  say, \"My noble, my cherished preserver! Here is a million pounds a year.  Rise up, Sir Oswald"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7700"],[0,"Lysistrata (#1)"],[1,"Translated from the Greek of    ARISTOPHANES    Illustrations by Norman Lindsay          FOREWORD    _Lysistrata_ is the greatest work by Aristophanes. This blank and rash  statement is made that it may be rejected. But first let it be  understood that I do not mean it is a better written work than the  _Birds_ or the _Frogs_, or that (to descend to the scale of values that  will be naturally imputed to me) it has any more appeal to the  collectors of \"curious literature\" than the _Ecclesiazusae_ or the  _Thesmophoriazusae_. On the mere grounds of taste I can see an at least  equally good case made out for the _Birds_. That brightly plumaged  fantasy has an aerial wit and colour all its own. But there are certain  works in which a man finds himself at an angle of vision where there is  an especially felicitous union of the aesthetic and emotional elements  which constitute the basic qualities of his uniqueness. We recognize  these works as being welded into a strange unity, as having a  homogeneous texture of ecstasy over them that surpasses any aesthetic  surface of harmonic colour, though that harmony also is understood by  the deeper welling of imagery from the core of creative exaltation. And  I think that this occurs in _Lysistrata_. The intellectual and spiritual  tendrils of the poem are more truly interwoven, the operation of their  centres more nearly unified; and so the work goes deeper into life. It  is his greatest play because of this, because it holds an intimate  perfume of femininity and gives the finest sense of the charm of a  cluster of girls, the sweet sense of their chatter, and the contact of  their bodies, that is to be found before Shakespeare, because that  mocking gaiety we call Aristophanies reaches here its most positive  acclamation of life, vitalizing sex with a deep delight, a rare  happiness of the spirit.    Indeed it is precisely for these reasons that it is _not_ considered  Aristophanes' greatest play.    To take a case which is sufficiently near to the point in question, to  make clear what I mean: the supremacy of _Antony and Cleopatra_ in the  Shakespearean aesthetic is yet jealously disputed, and it seems silly to  the academic to put it up against a work like _Hamlet_. But it is the  comparatively more obvious achievement of _Hamlet_, its surface  intellectuality, which made it the favourite of actors and critics. It  is much more difficult to realize the complex and delicately passionate  edge of the former play's rhythm, its tides of hugely wandering emotion,  the restless, proud, gay, and agonized reaction from life, of the blood,  of the mind, of the heart, which is its unity, than to follow the  relatively straightforward definition of Hamlet's nerves. Not that  anything derogatory to _Hamlet_ or the _Birds_ is intended; but the  value of such works is not enhanced by forcing them into contrast with  other works which cover deeper and wider nexus of aesthetic and  spiritual material. It is the very subtlety of the vitality of such  works as _Antony and Cleopatra_ and _Lysistrata_ that makes it so easy  to undervalue them, to see only a phallic play and political pamphlet in  one, only a chronicle play in a grandiose method in the other. For we  have to be in a highly sensitized condition before we can get to that  subtle point where life and the image mix, and so really perceive the  work at all; whereas we can command the response to a lesser work which  does not call so finely on the full breadth and depth of our spiritual  resources.    I amuse myself at times with the fancy that Homer, Sappho, and  Aristophanes are the inviolable Trinity of poetry, even to the extent of  being reducible to One. For the fiery and lucid directness of Sappho, if  her note of personal lyricism is abstracted, is seen to be an element of  Homer, as is the profoundly balanced humour of Aristophanes, at once  tenderly human and cruelly hard, as of a god to whom all sympathies and  tolerances are known, but who is invulnerable somewhere, who sees from a  point in space where the pressure of earth's fear and pain, and so its  pity, is lifted. It is here that the Shakespearean and Homeric worlds  impinge and merge, not to be separated by any academic classifications.  They meet in this sensitivity equally involved and aloof, sympathetic  and arrogant, suffering and joyous; and in this relation we see  Aristophanes as the forerunner of Shakespeare, his only one. We see also  that the whole present aesthetic of earth is based in Homer. We live and  grow in the world of consciousness bequeathed to us by him; and if we  grow beyond it through deeper Shakespearean ardours, it is because those  beyond are rooted in the broad basis of the Homeric imagination. To  shift that basis is to find the marshes of primitive night and fear  alone beneath the feet: Christianity.    And here we return to the question of the immorality of _Lysistrata_.  First we may inquire: is it possible for a man whose work has so  tremendous a significance in the spiritual development of mankind--and I  do not think anyone nowadays doubts that a work of art is the sole  stabilizing force that exists for life--is it possible for a man who  stands so grandly at head of an immense stream of liberating effort to  write an immoral work? Surely the only enduring moral virtue which can  be claimed is for that which moves to more power, beauty and delight in  the future? The plea that the question of changing customs arises is not  valid, for customs ratified by Aristophanes, by Rabelais, by  Shakespeare, have no right to change. If they have changed, let us try  immediately to return from our disgraceful refinements to the nobler and  more rarefied heights of lyric laughter, tragic intensity, and wit, for  we cannot have the first two without the last. And anyhow, how can a  social custom claim precedence over the undying material of the senses  and the emotions of man, over the very generating forces of life?    How could the humanistic emotions, such as pity, justice, sympathy,  exist save as pacifistic quietings of the desire to slay, to hurt, to  torment. Where the desire to hurt is gone pity ceases to be a  significant, a central emotion. It must of course continue to exist, but  it is displaced in the spiritual hierarchy; and all that moves  courageously, desirously, and vitally into the action of life takes on a  deeper and subtler intention. Lust, then, which on the lower plane was  something to be very frightened of, becomes a symbol of the highest  spirituality. It is right for Paul to be terrified of sex and so to hate  it, because he has so freshly escaped a bestial condition of life that  it threatens to plunge him back if he listens to one whisper But it is  also right for a Shakespeare to suck every drop of desire from life,  for he is building into a higher condition, one self-willed,  self-responsible, the discipline of which comes from joy, not fear.    Sex, therefore, is an animal function, one admits, one insists; it may  be only that. But also in the bewildering and humorous and tragic  duality of all life's energies, it is the bridge to every eternity which  is not merely a spectral condition of earth disembowelled of its lusts.  For sex holds the substance of the image. But we must remember with  Heine that Aristophanes is the God of this ironic earth, and that all  argument is apparently vitiated from the start by the simple fact that  Wagner and a rooster are given an analogous method of making love. And  therefore it seems impeccable logic to say that all that is most unlike  the rooster is the most spiritual part of love. All will agree on that,  schisms only arise when one tries to decide what does go farthest from  the bird's automatic mechanism. Certainly not a Dante-Beatrice affair  which is only the negation of the rooster in terms of the swooning  bombast of adolescence, the first onslaught of a force which the  sufferer cannot control or inhabit with all the potentialities of his  body and soul. But the rooster is troubled by no dreams of a divine  orgy, no carnival-loves like Beethoven's _Fourth Symphony_, no heroic  and shining lust gathering and swinging into a merry embrace like the  third act of _Siegfried_. It is desire in this sense that goes farthest  from the animal.    Consciously, no one can achieve the act of love on earth as a completed  thing of grace, with whatever delirium of delight, with whatever  ingenious preciosity, we go through its process. Only as an image of  beauty mated in some strange hermaphroditic ecstasy is that possible. I  mean only as a dream projected into a hypothetical, a real heaven. But  on earth we cannot complete the cycle in consciousness that would give  us the freedom of an image in which two identities mysteriously realize  their separate unities by the absorption of a third thing, the  constructive rhythm of a work of art. It is thus that Tristan and Isolde  become wholly distinct individuals, yet wholly submerged in the unity  that is Wagner; and so reconcile life's duality by balancing its  opposing laughters in a definite form--thereby sending out into life a  profounder duality than existed before. A Platonic equipoise,  Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence--the only real philosophic problem,  therefore one of which these two philosophers alone are aware.    But though Wagner with Mathilde Wesendonck in his arms was Tristan in  the arms of Isolde, he did not find a melody instead of a kiss on his  lips; he did not find a progression of harmonies melting through the  contours of a warm beauty with a blur of desperate ecstasies, semitones  of desire, he found only the anxious happiness of any other lover.  Nevertheless, he was gathering the substance of the second act of  _Tristan und Isolde_. And it is this that Plato means when he says that  fornication is something immortal in mortality. He does not mean that  the act itself is a"]]]
