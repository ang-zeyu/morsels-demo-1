ENLARGED EDITION WITH SELECTED READINGS    _Edited for the use of Schools, in accordance with the recent  Legislation upon Temperance Instruction_    INDORSEMENT.    BOSTON, _June_ 20, 1889.    The Pathfinder Series of Text-books on Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene  consists of the following volumes:    I. Child's Health Primer (for Primary Grades).    II. Hygiene for Young People or, Young People's Physiology. (for  Intermediate Classes)    III. Hygienic Physiology (for Advanced Pupils).    The above are the series originally prepared (as their general title  indicates) to supply the demand created by the laws for temperance  instruction in public schools in the United States. They were written by  experts under the supervision of the Scientific Department of the National  Woman's Christian Temperance Union, published by the instigation of the  same, and have been carefully revised from time to time, under the same  supervision, to keep them abreast with the latest teachings of science.    Being both teachable and well adapted to grade, their educational value,  as proven by schoolroom tests, is of the highest order. We therefore  cordially indorse and highly recommend the Pathfinder Series for use in  schools.    MARY H. HUNT,    _National and International Superintendent of the Scientific Dep't of  the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; Life Director of the National  Educational Association._    ADVISORY BOARD:    JOSEPH COOK, WILLIAM E. SHELDON, ALBERT H. PLUMB, D.D., DANIEL DORCHESTER,  D.D.    PREFACE    The term Physiology, or the science of the functions of the body, has come  to include Anatomy, or the science of its structure, and Hygiene, or the  laws of health; the one being essential to the proper understanding of  physiology, and the other being its practical application to life. The  three are intimately blended, and in treating of the different subjects  the author has drawn no line of distinction where nature has made none.  This work is not prepared for the use of medical students, but for the  instruction of youth in the principles which underlie the preservation of  health and the formation of correct physical habits. All else is made  subservient to this practical knowledge. A simple scientific dress is used  which, while conducing to clearness, also gratifies that general desire of  children to know something of the nomenclature of any study they pursue.    To the description of each organ is appended an account of its most common  diseases, accidents, etc., and, when practicable, their mode of treatment.  A pupil may thus learn, for example, the cause and cure of \"a cold,\" the  management of a wound, or the nature of an inflammation.    The Practical Questions, which have been a prominent feature in other  books of the series, will be found, it is hoped, equally useful in this  work. Directions for preparing simple microscopic objects, and  illustrations of the different organs, are given under each subject.    The Readings, which represent the ideas but not always the exact  phraseology of the author quoted, have, in general, been selected with  direct reference to Practical Hygiene, a subject which now largely  occupies the public mind. The dangers that lurk in foul air and  contaminated water, in bad drainage, leaky gas pipes, and defective  plumbing, in reckless appetites, and in careless dissemination of  contagious diseases, are here portrayed in such a manner as, it is  trusted, will assist the pupil to avoid these treacherous quicksands, and  to provide for himself a solid path of health.    Under the heading of Health and Disease will be found Hints about the sick  room, Directions for the use of Disinfectants, Suggestions as to what to  do \"Till the Doctor comes,\" and a list of antidotes for Poisons. Questions  for Class Use, a full Glossary, and an ample Index complete the book.    Believing in a Divine Architect of the human form, the author can not  refrain from occasionally pointing out His inimitable workmanship, and  impressing the lesson of a Great Final Cause.    The author has gleaned from every field, at home and abroad, to secure  that which would interest and profit his pupils. In general, Flint's great  work on the \"Physiology of Man,\" an undisputed authority on both sides of  the Atlantic, has been adopted as the standard in digestion, respiration,  circulation, and the nervous system. Leidy's \"Human Anatomy,\" and Sappey's  \"Traité d'Anatomie\" have been followed on all anatomical questions, and  have furnished many beautiful drawings. Huxley's \"Physiology\" has afforded  exceedingly valuable aid. Foster's \"Text-Book of Physiology,\" Hinton's  \"Health and its Conditions,\" Black's \"Ten Laws of Health,\" Williams's  practical essay on \"Our Eyes and How to Use them,\" Le Pileur's charming  treatise on \"The Wonders of the Human Body,\" and that quaint volume, \"Odd  Hours of a Physician,\" have aided the author with facts and fancies. The  writings of Draper, Dalton, Carpenter, Yalentin, Mapother, Watson,  Lankester, Letheby, Hall, Hamilton, Bell, Wilson, Bower, Cutter,  Hutchison, Wood, Bigelow, Stille, Holmes, Beigel, and others have been  freely consulted.    PUBLISHERS' NOTE.    An ABRIDGED EDITION of this work is published, to afford a cheaper manual  --adapted to Junior Classes and Common Schools. The abridgment contains  the essence of this text, nearly all its illustrations, and the whole of  the Temperance matter as here presented.

The mere reading of a statement is of little value compared with the  observation of a fact. Every opportunity should therefore be taken of  exhibiting to the pupil the phenomena described, and thus making them  real. A microscope is so essential to the understanding of many subjects,  that it is indispensable to the proper teaching of Physiology. A suitable  instrument and carefully prepared specimens, showing the structure of the  bones, the skin, and the blood of various animals, the pigment cells of  the eye, etc., may be obtained at a small cost from any good optician.    On naming the subject of a paragraph, the pupil should be prepared to tell  all he knows about it. No failure should discourage the teacher in  establishing this mode of study and recitation. A little practice will  produce the most satisfactory results. The unexpected question and the apt  reply develop a certain sharpness and readiness which are worthy of  cultivation. The questions for review, or any others that the wit of the  teacher may suggest, can be effectively used to break the monotony of a  topical recitation, thereby securing the benefits of both systems.    The pupil should expect to be questioned each day upon any subject passed  over during the term, and thus the entire knowledge gained will be within  his grasp for instant use. While some are reciting to the teacher, let  others write on slates or on the blackboard. At the close of the  recitation, let all criticise the ideas, the spelling, the use of  capitals, the pronunciation, the grammar, and the mode of expression.  Greater accuracy and much collateral drill may thus be secured at little  expense of valuable school time.    The Introduction is designed merely to furnish suggestive material for the  first lesson, preparatory to beginning the study. Other subjects for  consideration may be found in the section on Health and Disease, in the  Selected Readings, and among the questions given in the Appendix. Where  time will allow, the Selected Readings may profitably be used in  connection with the topics to which they relate. Questions upon them are  so incorporated with those upon the text proper "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7001"],[0,"History of the Philippine Islands (#1)"],[1,"eBook was produced by Jeroen Hellingman            MORGA'S PHILIPPINE ISLANDS    VOLUME I      Of this work five hundred copies are issued separately from \"The  Philippine Islands, 1493-1898,\" in fifty-five volumes.

Capture of van Noordt's admiral's ship; ut supra, p. 46.        PREFACE    In this volume is presented the first installment of Dr. Antonio  de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas. Events here described  cover the years 1493-1603, and the history proper of the islands from  1565. Morga's work is important, as being written by a royal official  and a keen observer and participator in affairs. Consequently he  touches more on the practical everyday affairs of the islands, and in  his narrative shows forth the policies of the government, its ideals,  and its strengths and weaknesses. His book is written in the true  historic spirit, and the various threads of the history of the islands  are followed systematically. As being one of the first of published  books regarding the Philippines, it has especial value. Political,  social, and economic phases of life, both among the natives and their  conquerors, are treated. The futility of the Spanish policy in making  external expeditions, and its consequent neglect of internal affairs;  the great Chinese question; the growth of trade; communication with  Japan; missionary movements from the islands to surrounding countries;  the jealous and envious opposition of the Portuguese; the dangers of  sea-voyages: all these are portrayed vividly, yet soberly. Morga's  position in the state allowed him access to many documents, and he  seems to have been on general good terms with all classes, so that he  readily gained a knowledge of facts. The character of Morga's work  and his comprehensive treatment of the history, institutions, and  products of the Philippines, render possible and desirable the copious  annotations of this and the succeeding volume. These annotations are  contributed in part by those of Lord Stanley's translation of Morga,  and those of Rizal's reprint, while the Recopilación de leyes de  Indias furnishes a considerable number of laws.    The book is preceded by the usual licenses and authorizations, followed  by the author's dedication and introduction. In the latter he declares  his purpose in writing his book to be that \"the deeds achieved by our  Spaniards in the discovery, conquest, and conversion of the Filipinas  Islands--as well as various fortunes that they have had from time to  time in the great kingdoms and among the pagan peoples surrounding the  islands\" may be known. The first seven chapters of the book treat of  \"discoveries, conquests, and other events ... until the death of Don  Pedro de Acuña.\" The eighth chapter treats of the natives, government,  conversion, and other details.    In rapid survey the author passes the line of demarcation of Alexander  VI, and the voyages of Magalhães and Elcano, Loaisa, Villalobos,  and others, down to the expedition of Legazpi. The salient points  of this expedition are briefly outlined, his peaceful reception  by Tupas and the natives, but their later hostility, because the  Spaniards \"seized their provisions,\" their defeat, the Spaniards'  first settlement in Sebu, and the despatching of the advice-boat to  Nueva España to discover the return passage, and inform the viceroy of  the success of the expedition. From Sebu the conquest and settlement  is extended to other islands, and the Spanish capital is finally moved  to Manila. Events come rapidly. The conquest proceeds \"by force of  arms or by the efforts of the religious who have sown the good seeds  of the gospel.\" Land is allotted to the conquerors, and towns are  gradually founded, and the amount of the natives' tribute is fixed.    At Legazpi's death Guido de Lavezaris assumes his responsibilities  by virtue of a royal despatch among Legazpi's papers, and continues  the latter's plans. The pirate Limahon is defeated after having slain  Martin de Goiti. Trade with China is established \"and as a consequence  has been growing ever since.\" The two towns of Betis and Lubao  allotted by Lavezaris to himself are taken from him later by order  of his successor, Dr. Francisco de Sande, but are restored to him by  express order of the king, together with the office of master-of-camp.    Succeeding Lavezaris in 1575, Dr. Francisco de Sande continues \"the  pacification of the islands .... especially that of the province  of Camarines.\" The town of Nueva Cáceres is founded, and Sande's  partially effective campaign to Borneo, and its offshoot--that of  Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Mindanao--undertaken. The \"San  Juanillo\" is despatched to Nueva España, \"but it was lost at sea  and never heard of again.\" Sande is relieved of his governorship  by Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pefialosa, and after his residencia returns  \"to Nueva España as auditor of Mexico.\"    Chapter III details the events of Gonzalo Ronquillo de  Pefialosa's administration and the interim of government of Diego  Ronquillo. Events, with the greater stability constantly given the  islands, follow more quickly. Gonzalo de Peñalosa, by an agreement with  the king, is to take six hundred colonists--married and single--to  the islands, in return for which he is to be governor for life. He  establishes the town of Arevalo in Panay, builds the Chinese Parián,  endeavors, although unsuccessfully, to discover a return passage  to Nueva España, by the South Sea, and despatches \"a ship to Peru  with merchandise to trade for certain goods which he said that the  Filipinas needed.\" He imposes the two per cent export duty on goods  to Nueva España, and the three per cent duty on Chinese merchandise,  and \"although he was censured for having done this without his  Majesty's orders\" they \"remained in force, and continued to be imposed  thenceforward.\" The first expedition in aid of Tidore is sent for  the conquest of the island of Ternate, but proves a failure. Cagayan  is first pacified, and the town of Nueva Cáceres founded. Gabriel de  Rivera, after an expedition to Borneo, is sent to Spain to consult  the best interests of the islands. Domingo de Salazar receives his  appointment as bishop, and is accompanied to the islands by Antonio  Sedeño and Alonso Sanchez, the first Jesuits in the islands. In 1583  Gonzalo de Peñalosa dies, and is succeeded by his kinsman Diego  Ronquillo. Shortly after occurs Manila's first disastrous fire,  but the city is rebuilt, although with difficulty. In consequence of  Rivera's trip to Spain, the royal Audiencia of Manila is established  with Santiago de Vera as its president and governor of the islands.    In the fourth chapter are related the events of Santiago de Vera's  administration, and the suppression of the Audiencia. Vera reaches  the islands in 1584, whence shortly afterwards he despatches another  expedition to the Malucos which also fails. The pacification continues,  and the islands are freed from a rebellion and insurrection conspired  between Manila and Pampanga chiefs. Fortifications are built and an  artillery foundry established under the charge of natives. During  this term Candish makes his memorable voyage, passing through  some of the islands. Finally the Audiencia is suppressed, through  the representations made by Alonso Sanchez, who is sent to Spain  and Rome with authority to act for all classes of society. On his  return he brings from Rome \"many relics, bulls, and letters for the  Filipinas.\" Through the influence of the Jesuit, Gomez Perez Dasmariñas  receives appointment as governor of the islands; and with his salary  increased to \"ten thousand Castilian ducados\" and with despatches for  the suppression of the Audiencia, and the establishment of regular  soldiers, he arrives at Manila in May, 1590.    Chapter V deals with the term of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas and the  interims of Pedro de Rojas and Luis Perez Dasmariñas. The term of the  new governor is characterized by his great energy and enthusiasm. The  Manila wall and other fortifications, the building of"]]]
