List and learn, ye dainty roses,                        Roses white and roses red,                   Why we bind you into posies                        Ere your morning bloom has fled.                   By a law of maiden's making,                   Accents of a heart that's aching,                   Even though that heart be breaking,                        Should by maiden be unsaid:                   Though they love with love exceeding,                   They must seem to be unheeding                   Go ye then and do their pleading,                        Roses white and roses red!

CHORUS (Girls).     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!         Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.                        Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!

Buon' giorno, signorine, etc.                          DUETMARCO and GIUSEPPE.                          We're called gondolieri,                        But that's a vagary,                        It's quite honorary                             The trade that we ply.

At summer day's nooning,                        When weary lagooning,                        Our mandolins tuning,                             We lazily thrum.                          When vespers are ringing,                        To hope ever clinging,                        With songs of our singing                             A vigil we keep,                        When daylight is fading,                        Enwrapt in night's shading,                        With soft serenading                             We sing them to sleep.

A bias to disclose                        Would be indelicate      GIU.           And therefore we propose                        To let impartial Fate                        Select for us a mate!      ALL.                     Viva!      GIRLS.

Brit. Mus.    SIR,    I return your very curious Roll of Cookery, and I trust with some  Interest, not full I confess nor legal, but the utmost which your  Debtor, from the scantiness of his ability, can at present afford.  Indeed, considering your respectable situation in life, and that  diffusive sphere of knowledge and science in which you are acting, it  must be exceedingly difficult for any one, how well furnished soever,  completely to answer your just, or even most moderate demands. I  intreat the favour of you, however, to accept for once this short  payment in lieu of better, or at least as a public testimony of that  profound regard wherewith I am,    SIR,    Your affectionate friend,  and most obliged servant,  St. George's day, 1780.    S. PEGGE.          PREFACE    TO THE    CURIOUS ANTIQUARIAN READER.    Without beginning _ab ovo_ on a subject so light (a matter of  importance, however, to many a modern Catius or Amasinius), by  investigating the origin of the Art of Cookery, and the nature of it  as practised by the Antediluvians [1]; without dilating on the  several particulars concerning it afterwards amongst the Patriarchs,  as found in the Bible [2], I shall turn myself immediately, and  without further preamble, to a few cursory observations respecting  the Greeks, Romans, Britons, and those other nations, Saxons, Danes,  and Normans, with whom the people of this nation are more closely  connected.    The Greeks probably derived something of their skill from the East,  (from the Lydians principally, whose cooks are much celebrated, [3])  and something from Egypt. A few hints concerning Cookery may be  collected from Homer, Aristophanes, Aristotle, &c. but afterwards  they possessed many authors on the subject, as may be seen in  Athenæus [4]. And as Diætetics were esteemed a branch of the study of  medicine, as also they were afterwards [5], so many of those authors  were Physicians; and _the Cook_ was undoubtedly a character of high  reputation at Athens [6].    As to the Romans; they would of course borrow much of their culinary  arts from the Greeks, though the Cook with them, we are told, was one  of the lowest of their slaves [7]. In the latter times, however, they  had many authors on the subject as well as the Greeks, and the  practitioners were men of some Science [8], but, unhappily for us,  their compositions are all lost except that which goes under the name  of Apicius; concerning which work and its author, the prevailing  opinion now seems to be, that it was written about the time of  _Heliogabalus_ [9], by one _Cælius_, (whether _Aurelianus_ is not so  certain) and that _Apicius_ is only the title of it [10]. However,  the compilation, though not in any great repute, has been several  times published by learned men.    The Aborigines of Britain, to come nearer home, could have no great  expertness in Cookery, as they had no oil, and we hear nothing of  their butter, they used only sheep and oxen, eating neither hares,  though so greatly esteemed at Rome, nor hens, nor geese, from a  notion of superstition. Nor did they eat fish. There was little corn  in the interior part of the island, but they lived on milk and flesh  [11]; though it is expressly asserted by Strabo that they had no  cheese [12]. The later Britons, however, well knew how to make the  best use of the cow, since, as appears from the laws of _Hoel Dda_,  A.D. 943, this animal was a creature so essential, so common and  useful in Wales, as to be the standard in rating fines, &c. [13].    Hengist, leader of the Saxons, made grand entertainments for king  Vortigern [14], but no particulars have come down to us; and  certainly little exquisite can be expected from a people then so  extremely barbarous as not to be able either to read or write.  'Barbari homines a septentrione, (they are the words of Dr. Lister)  caseo et ferina subcruda victitantes, omnia condimenta adjectiva  respuerunt' [15].    Some have fancied, that as the Danes imported the custom of hard and  deep drinking, so they likewise introduced the practice of  gormandizing, and that this word itself is derived from _Gormund_,  the name of that Danish king whom Ælfred the Great persuaded to be  christened, and called Æthelstane [16], Now 'tis certain that  Hardicnut stands on record as an egregious glutton [17], but he is  not particularly famous for being a _curious Viander_; 'tis true  again, that the Danes in general indulged excessively in feasts and  entertainments [18], but we have no reason to imagine any elegance  of Cookery to have flourished amongst them. And though Guthrum, the  Danish prince, is in some authors named _Gormundus_ [19]; yet this is  not the right etymology of our English word _Gormandize_, since it is  rather the French _Gourmand_, or the British _Gormod_ [20]. So that  we have little to say as to the Danes.    I shall take the later English and the Normans together, on account  of the intermixture of the two nations after the Conquest, since, as  lord Lyttelton observes, the English accommodated them elves to the  Norman manners, except in point of temperance in eating and drinking,  and communicated to them their own habits of drunkenness and  immoderate feasting [21]. Erasmus also remarks, that the English in  his time were attached to _plentiful and splendid tables_; and the  same is observed by Harrison [22]. As to the Normans, both William I.  and Rufus made grand entertainments [23]; the former was remarkable  for an immense paunch, and withal was so exact, so nice and curious  in his repasts [24], that when his prime favourite William Fitz-  Osberne, who as steward of the household had the charge of the Cury,  served him with the flesh of a crane scarcely half-roasted, he was so  highly exasperated, that he lifted up his fist, and would have  strucken him, had not Eudo, appointed _Dapiser_ immediately after,  warded off the blow [25].    _Dapiser_, by which is usually understood _steward of the king's  household_ [26], was a high officer amongst the Normans; and  _Larderarius_ was another, clergymen then often occupying this post,  and sometimes made bishops from it [27]. He was under the _Dapiser_,  as was likewise the _Cocus Dominicæ Coquinæ_, concerning whom, his  assistants and allowances, the _Liber Niger_ may be consulted [28].  It appears further from _Fleta_, that the chief cooks were often  providers, as well as dressers, of victuals [29]. But _Magister  Coquinæ_, who was an esquire by office, seems to have had the care of  pourveyance, A.D. 1340 [30], and to have nearly corresponded with  our _clerk of the kitchen_, having authority over the cooks [31].  However, the _Magnus Coquus_, _Coquorum Præpositus_, _Coquus Regius_,  and _Grans Queux_, were officers of considerable dignity in the  palaces of princes; and the officers under them, according to Du  Fresne, were in the French court A.D. 1385, much about the time that  our Roll was made, 'Queus, Aideurs, Asteurs, Paiges, Souffleurs,  Enfans, Saussiers de Commun, Saussiers devers le Roy, Sommiers,  Poulliers, Huissiers' [32].    In regard to religious houses, the Cooks of the greater foundations  were officers of consequence, though under the Cellarer [33], and if  he were not a monk, he nevertheless was to enjoy the portion of a  monk [34]. But it appears from Somner, that at Christ Church,  Canterbury, the _Lardyrer_ was the first or chief cook [35]; and this  officer, as we have seen, was often an ecclesiastic. However, the  great Houses had Cooks of different ranks [36]; and manors and  churches [37] were often given _ad cibum_ and _ad victum monachorum_    [38]. A fishing at Lambeth was allotted to that purpose [39].    But whether the Cooks were Monks or not, the _Magistri Coquinæ_,  Kitcheners, of the monasteries, we may depend upon it, were always  monks; and I think they were mostly ecclesiastics elsewhere: thus  when Cardinal Otto, the Pope's legate, was at Oxford, A. 1238, and  that memorable fray happened between his retinue and the students,  the _Magister Coquorum_ was the Legate's brother, and was there  killed [40]. The reason given in the author, why a person so nearly  allied to the Great Man was assigned to the office, is this, 'Ne  procuraretur aliquid venenorum, quod nimis [i.e. valde] timebat  legatus;' and it is certain that poisoning was but too much in vogue  in these times, both amongst the Italians and the good people of this  island [41]; so that this was a post of signal trust and confidence.  And indeed afterwards, a person was employed to _taste_, or _take  the assaie_, as it was called [42], both of the messes and the water  in the ewer [43], at great tables; but it may be doubted whether a  particular person was appointed to this service, or it was a branch  of the _Sewer's_ and cup-bearer's duty, for I observe, the _Sewer_ is  sometimes called _Prægustator_ [44], and the cup-bearer tastes the  water elsewhere [45]. The religious houses, and their presidents, the  abbots and priors, had their days of _Gala_, as likewise their halls  for strangers, whom, when persons of rank, they often entertained  with splendour and magnificence. And as for the secular clergy,  archbishops and bishops, their feasts, of which we have some upon  record [46], were so superb, that they might vie either with the"]]]
