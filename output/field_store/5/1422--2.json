Henty      [Illustration: GUY AYLMER SAVES THE KING'S LIFE AT THE BATTLE OF  AGINCOURT.]          PREFACE      The long and bloody feud between the houses of Orleans and Burgundy--which  for many years devastated France, caused a prodigious destruction of life  and property, and was not even relaxed in the presence of a common enemy--is very fully recorded in the pages of Monstrellet and other contemporary  historians. I have here only attempted to relate the events of the early  portion of the struggle--from its commencement up to the astonishing  victory of Agincourt, won by a handful of Englishmen over the chivalry of  France. Here the two factions, with the exception of the Duke of Burgundy  himself, laid aside their differences for the moment, only to renew them  while France still lay prostrate at the feet of the English conqueror.    At this distance of time, even with all the records at one's disposal, it  is difficult to say which party was most to blame in this disastrous civil  war, a war which did more to cripple the power of France than was ever  accomplished by English arms. Unquestionably Burgundy was the first to  enter upon the struggle, but the terrible vengeance taken by the  Armagnacs,--as the Orleanists came to be called,--for the murders  committed by the mob of Paris in alliance with him, was of almost  unexampled atrocity in civil war, and was mainly responsible for the  terrible acts of cruelty afterwards perpetrated upon each other by both  parties. I hope some day to devote another volume to the story of this  desperate and unnatural struggle.    G. A. HENTY.          CONTENTS          I. A FEUDAL CASTLE       II. TROUBLES IN FRANCE      III.

His father and grandfather both were Edward's men, and held  their castle for us; his father was a great friend of the Black Prince,  and he, too, took a wife from England. Since then things have not gone  well with us in France, and they say that our lord has had difficulty in  keeping clear of the quarrels that are always going on out there between  the great French lords; and, seeing that we have but little power in  Artois, he has to hold himself discreetly, and to keep aloof as far as he  can from the strife there, and bide his time until the king sends an army  to win back his own again. But I doubt not that, although our lady's  wishes and the queen's favour may have gone some way with him, the king  thought more of the advantage of keeping this French noble,--whose fathers  have always been faithful vassals of the crown, and who was himself  English on his mother's side,--faithful to us, ready for the time when the  royal banner will flutter in the wind again, and blood will flow as it did  at Cressy and Poitiers.    \"The example of a good knight like Sir Eustace taking the field for us  with his retainers might lead others to follow his example; besides, there  were several suitors for our lady's hand, and, by giving her to this  French baron, there would be less offence and heart-burning than if he had  chosen one among her English suitors. And, indeed, I know not that we have  suffered much from its being so; it is true that our lord and lady live  much on their estates abroad, but at least they are here part of their  time, and their castellan does not press us more heavily during their  absence than does our lord when at home.\"    \"He is a goodly knight, is Sir Aylmer, a just man and kindly, and, being a  cousin of our lady's, they do wisely and well in placing all things in his  hands during their absence.\"    \"Ay, we have nought to grumble at, for we might have done worse if we had  had an English lord for our master, who might have called us into the  field when he chose, and have pressed us to the utmost of his rights  whenever he needed money.\"    The speakers were a man and woman, who were standing looking on at a party  of men practising at the butts on the village green at Summerley, one of  the hamlets on the estates of Sir Eustace de Villeroy, in Hampshire.    \"Well shot!\" the man exclaimed, as an archer pierced a white wand at a  distance of eighty yards. \"They are good shots all, and if our lord and  lady have fears of troubles in France, they do right well in taking a band  of rare archers with them. There are but five-and-twenty of them, but they  are all of the best. When they offered prizes here a month since for the  bowmen of Hants and Sussex and Dorset, methought they had some good reason  why they should give such high prizes as to bring hither the best men from  all three counties, and we were all proud that four of our own men should  have held their own so well in such company, and especially that Tom, the  miller's son, should have beaten the best of them. He is captain of the  band, you know, but almost all the others shoot nigh as well; there is not  one of them who cannot send an arrow straight into the face of a foe at a  hundred and twenty yards. There were some others as good who would fain  have been of the party, but our lady said she would take no married men,  and she was right. They go for five years certain, and methinks a man  fights all the better when he knows there is no one in England praying for  his return, and that if he falls, there is no widow or children to bewail  his loss. There are as many stout men-at-arms going too; so the Castle of  Villeroy will be a hard nut for anyone to crack, for I hear they can put a  hundred and fifty of their vassals there in the field.\"    \"We shall miss Sir Aylmer's son Guy,\" the woman said; \"he is ever down at  the village green when there are sports going on. There is not one of his  age who can send an arrow so straight to the mark, and not many of the  men; and he can hold his own with a quarter-staff too.\"    \"Ay, dame; he is a stout lad, and a hearty one. They say that at the  castle he is ever practising with arms, and that though scarce sixteen he  can wield a sword and heavy battle-axe as well as any man-at-arms there.\"    \"He is gentle too,\" the woman said. \"Since his mother's death he often  comes down with wine and other goodies if anyone is ill, and he speaks as  softly as a girl. There is not one on the estate but has a good word for  him, nor doubts that he will grow up as worthy a knight as his father,  though gentler perhaps in his manner, and less grave in face, for he was  ever a merry lad. Since the death of his lady mother two years ago he has  gone about sadly, still of late he has gotten over his loss somewhat, and  he can laugh heartily again. I wonder his father can bear to part with  him.\"    \"Sir Eustace knows well enough that he cannot always keep the boy by his  side, dame; and that if a falcon is to soar well, he must try his wings  early. He goes as page, does he not?\"    \"Ay, but more, methinks, as companion to young Henry, who has, they say,  been sickly from a child, and, though better now, has scarce the making of  a stalwart knight in him. His young brother Charles is a sturdy little  chap, and bids fair to take after his father; and little Lady Agnes, who  comes between them, is full of fire and spirit.    \"Yes; methinks Guy will have a pleasant time of it out there; that is, if  there are no fresh troubles. I doubt not that in two or three years he  will be one of our lord's esquires, and if he has a chance of displaying  his courage and skill, may be back among us a dubbed knight before many  years have passed over our heads. France is a rare place for gaining  honours, and so it may well be, for I see not that we gain much else by  our king's possessions there.\"    \"There was plenty of spoil brought over, dame, after Cressy and Poitiers.\"    \"Ay, but it soon goes; easy come, easy go, you know; and though they say  that each man that fought there brought home a goodly share of spoil, I  will warrant me the best part went down their throats ere many months had  passed.\"    \"'Tis ever so, dame; but I agree with you, and deem that it would be  better for England if we did not hold a foot of ground in France, and if  English kings and nobles "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#1)"],[1,"OF THE BUSH      By Henry Lawson      [Transcriber's notes: The year of first magazine publication is shown in  the table of contents below.

Anyway he woke three or four others who were  sleeping on beds and stretchers, and one on a shake-down on the floor,  in the same room. It had been a wet night, and the shanty was full of  shearers from Big Billabong Shed which had cut out the day before. My  room mates had been drinking and gambling overnight, and they swore  luridly at the intruder for disturbing them.    He was six-foot-three or thereabout. He was loosely built, bony,  sandy-complexioned and grey eyed. He wore a good-humoured grin at most  times, as I noticed later on; he was of a type of bushman that I always  liked--the sort that seem to get more good-natured the longer they grow,  yet are hard-knuckled and would accommodate a man who wanted to fight,  or thrash a bully in a good-natured way. The sort that like to carry  somebody's baby round, and cut wood, carry water and do little things  for overworked married bushwomen. He wore a saddle-tweed sac suit two  sizes too small for him, and his face, neck, great hands and bony wrists  were covered with sun-blotches and freckles.    \"I hope I ain't disturbin' yer,\" he shouted, as he bent over my bunk,  \"but there's a cove--\"    \"You needn't shout!\" I interrupted, \"I'm not deaf.\"    \"Oh--I beg your pardon!\" he shouted. \"I didn't know I was yellin'. I  thought you was the deaf feller.\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" I said. \"What's the trouble?\"    \"Wait till them other chaps is done swearin' and I'll tell yer,\" he  said. He spoke with a quiet, good-natured drawl, with something of the  nasal twang, but tone and drawl distinctly Australian--altogether apart  from that of the Americans.    \"Oh, spit it out for Christ's sake, Long'un!\" yelled One-eyed Bogan, who  had been the worst swearer in a rough shed, and he fell back on his bunk  as if his previous remarks had exhausted him.    \"It's that there sick jackaroo that was pickin'-up at Big Billabong,\"  said the Giraffe. \"He had to knock off the first week, an' he's been  here ever since. They're sendin' him away to the hospital in Sydney by  the speeshall train. They're just goin' to take him up in the wagonette  to the railway station, an' I thought I might as well go round with the  hat an' get him a few bob. He's got a missus and kids in Sydney.\"    \"Yer always goin' round with yer gory hat!\" growled Bogan. \"Yer'd blanky  well take it round in hell!\"    \"That's what he's doing, Bogan,\" muttered Gentleman Once, on the  shake-down, with his face to the wall.    The hat was a genuine \"cabbage-tree,\" one of the sort that \"last a  lifetime.\" It was well coloured, almost black in fact with weather and  age, and it had a new strap round the base of the crown. I looked into  it and saw a dirty pound note and some silver. I dropped in half  a crown, which was more than I could spare, for I had only been a  green-hand at Big Billabong.    \"Thank yer!\" he said. \"Now then, you fellers!\"    \"I wish you'd keep your hat on your head, and your money in your pockets  and your sympathy somewhere else,\" growled Jack Moonlight as he raised  himself painfully on his elbow, and felt under his pillow for two  half-crowns. \"Here,\" he said, \"here's two half-casers. Chuck 'em in and  let me sleep for God's sake!\"    Gentleman Once, the gambler, rolled round on his shake-down, bringing  his good-looking, dissipated face from the wall. He had turned in in his  clothes and, with considerable exertion he shoved his hand down into the  pocket of his trousers, which were a tight fit. He brought up a roll of  pound notes and could find no silver.    \"Here,\" he said to the Giraffe, \"I might as well lay a quid. I'll chance  it anyhow. Chuck it in.\"    \"You've got rats this mornin', Gentleman Once,\" growled the Bogan. \"It  ain't a blanky horse race.\"    \"P'r'aps I have,\" said Gentleman Once, and he turned to the wall again  with his head on his arm.    \"Now, Bogan, yer might as well chuck in somethin,\" said the Giraffe.    \"What's the matter with the ---- jackaroo?\" asked the Bogan, tugging his  trousers from under the mattress.    Moonlight said something in a low tone.    \"The ---- he has!\" said Bogan. \"Well, I pity the ----! Here, I'll chuck  in half a ---- quid!\" and he dropped half a sovereign into the hat.    The fourth man, who was known to his face as \"Barcoo-Rot,\" and behind  his back as \"The Mean Man,\" had been drinking all night, and not even  Bogan's stump-splitting adjectives could rouse him. So Bogan got out of  bed, and calling on us (as blanky female cattle) to witness what he was  about to do, he rolled the drunkard over, prospected his pockets till  he made up five shillings (or a \"caser\" in bush language), and \"chucked\"  them into the hat.    And Barcoo-Rot is probably unconscious to this day that he was ever  connected with an act of charity. The Giraffe struck the deaf jackaroo  in the neat room. I heard the chaps cursing \"Long-'un\" for waking them,  and \"Deaf-'un\" for being, as they thought at first, the indirect cause  of the disturbance. I heard the Giraffe and his hat being condemned  in other rooms and cursed along the veranda where more shearers were  sleeping; and after a while I turned out.    The Giraffe was carefully fixing a mattress and pillows on the floor of  a wagonette, and presently a man, who looked like a corpse, was carried  out and lifted into the trap.    As the wagonette started, the shanty-keeper--a fat, soulless-looking  man--put his hand in his pocket and dropped a quid into the hat which  was still going round, in the hands of the Giraffe's mate, little Teddy  Thompson, who was as far below medium height as the Giraffe was above  it.    The Giraffe took the horse's head and led him along on the most level  parts of the road towards the railway station, and two or three chaps  went along to help get the sick man into the train.    The shearing-season was over in that district, but I got a job of  house-painting, which was my trade, at the Great Western Hotel (a  two-story brick place), and I stayed in Bourke for a couple of months.      The Giraffe was a Victorian native from Bendigo. He was well known in  Bourke and to many shearers who came through the great dry scrubs  from hundreds of miles round. He was stakeholder, drunkard's banker,  peacemaker where possible, referee or second to oblige the chaps when  a fight was on, big brother or uncle to most of the children in town,  final court of appeal when the youngsters had a dispute over a foot-race  at the school picnic, referee at their fights, and he was the stranger's  friend.    \"The feller as knows can battle around for himself,\" he'd say. \"But  I always like to do what I can for a hard-up stranger cove. I was a  green-hand jackaroo once meself, and I know what it is.\"    \"You're always bothering about other people, Giraffe,\" said Tom Hall,  the shearers' union secretary, who was only a couple of inches shorter  than the Giraffe. \"There's nothing in it, you can take it from me--I  ought to know.\"    \"Well, what's a feller to do?\" said the Giraffe. \"I'm only hangin'  round here till shearin' starts agen, an' a cove might as well be doin'  something. Besides, it ain't as if I was like a cove that had old people  or a wife an' kids to look after. I ain't got no responsibilities. A  feller can't be doin' nothin'. Besides, I like to lend a helpin' hand  when I can.\"    \"Well, all I've got to say,\" said Tom, most of whose screw went in  borrowed quids, etc. \"All I've got to say is that you'll get no thanks,  and you might blanky well starve in the end.\"    \"There ain't no fear of me starvin' so long as I've got me hands about  me; an' I ain't a cove as wants thanks,\" said the Giraffe.    He was always helping someone or something. Now it was a bit of a  \"darnce\" that we was gettin' up for the girls; again it was Mrs Smith,  the woman whose husban' was drowned in the flood in the Began River  lars' Crismas, or that there poor woman down by the Billabong--her  husband cleared out and left her with a lot o' kids.
