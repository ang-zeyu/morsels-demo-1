And still the poet made for her little chaplets of song, to deck her  forehead in the courts of Time: and still she wore instead the worthless  garlands, that boisterous citizens flung to her in the ways, made out of  perishable things.    And after a while whenever these garlands died the poet came to her  with his chaplets of song; and still she laughed at him and wore the  worthless wreaths, though they always died at evening.    And one day in his bitterness the poet rebuked her, and said to her:  \"Lovely Fame, even in the highways and the byways you have not  foreborne to laugh and shout and jest with worthless men, and I have  toiled for you and dreamed of you and you mock me and pass me by.\"    And Fame turned her back on him and walked away, but in departing  she looked over her shoulder and smiled at him as she had not smiled  before, and, almost speaking in a whisper, said:    \"I will meet you in the graveyard at the back of the Workhouse in a  hundred years.\"          CHARON      Charon leaned forward and rowed. All things were one with his  weariness.    It was not with him a matter of years or of centuries, but of wide  floods of time, and an old heaviness and a pain in the arms that had  become for him part of the scheme that the gods had made and was  of a piece with Eternity.    If the gods had even sent him a contrary wind it would have divided  all time in his memory into two equal slabs.    So grey were all things always where he was that if any radiance  lingered a moment among the dead, on the face of such a queen  perhaps as Cleopatra, his eyes could not have perceived it.    It was strange that the dead nowadays were coming in such numbers.  They were coming in thousands where they used to come in fifties. It  was neither Charon's duty nor his wont to ponder in his grey soul why  these things might be. Charon leaned forward and rowed.    Then no one came for a while. It was not usual for the gods to send  no one down from Earth for such a space. But the gods knew best.    Then one man came alone. And the little shade sat shivering on a  lonely bench and the great boat pushed off. Only one passenger:  the gods knew best. And great and weary Charon rowed on and on  beside the little, silent, shivering ghost.    And the sound of the river was like a mighty sigh that Grief in the  beginning had sighed among her sisters, and that could not die like  the echoes of human sorrow failing on earthly hills, but was as old  as time and the pain in Charon's arms.    Then the boat from the slow, grey river loomed up to the coast of  Dis and the little, silent shade still shivering stepped ashore, and  Charon turned the boat to go wearily back to the world. Then the  little shadow spoke, that had been a man.    \"I am the last,\" he said.    No one had ever made Charon smile before, no one before had ever  made him weep.          THE DEATH OF PAN      When the travellers from London entered Arcady they lamented one to  another the death of Pan.    And anon they saw him lying stiff and still.    Horned Pan was still and the dew was on his fur; he had not the look  of a live animal. And then they said, \"It is true that Pan is dead.\"    And, standing melancholy by that huge prone body, they looked for  long at memorable Pan.    And evening came and a small star appeared.    And presently from a hamlet of some Arcadian valley, with a sound  of idle song, Arcadian maidens came.    And, when they saw there, suddenly in the twilight, that old recumbent  god, they stopped in their running and whispered among themselves.  \"How silly he looks,\" they said, and thereat they laughed a little.    And at the sound of their laughter Pan leaped up and the gravel flew  from his hooves.    And, for as long as the travellers stood and listened, the crags and  the hill-tops of Arcady rang with the sounds of pursuit.          THE SPHINX AT GIZEH      I saw the other day the Sphinx's painted face.    She had painted her face in order to ogle Time.    And he has spared no other painted face in all the world but hers.    Delilah was younger than she, and Delilah is dust. Time hath loved  nothing but this worthless painted face.    I do not care that she is ugly, nor that she has painted her face, so  that she only lure his secret from Time.    Time dallies like a fool at her feet when he should be smiting cities.    Time never wearies of her silly smile.    There are temples all about her that he has forgotten to spoil.    I saw an old man go by, and Time never touched him.    Time that has carried away the seven gates of Thebes!    She has tried to bind him with ropes of eternal sand, she had hoped  to oppress him with the Pyramids.    He lies there in the sand with his foolish hair all spread about her paws.    If she ever finds his secret we will put out his eyes, so that he shall  find no more our beautiful things--there are lovely gates in Florence  that I fear he will carry away.    We have tried to bind him with song and with old customs, but they  only held him for a little while, and he has always smitten us and  mocked us.    When he is blind he shall dance to us and make sport.    Great clumsy time shall stumble and dance, who liked to kill little  children, and can hurt even the daisies no longer.    Then shall our children laugh at him who slew Babylon's winged bulls,  and smote great numbers of the gods and fairies--when he is shorn  of his hours and his years.    We will shut him up in the Pyramid of Cheops, in the great chamber  where the sarcophagus is. Thence we will lead him out when we  give our feasts. He shall ripen our corn for us and do menial work.    We will kiss they painted face, O Sphinx, if thou wilt betray to us Time.    And yet I fear that in his ultimate anguish he may take hold blindly  of the world and the moon, and slowly pull down upon him the  House of Man.          THE HEN      All along the farmyard gables the swallows sat a-row, twittering  uneasily to one another, telling of many things, but thinking only of  Summer and the South, for Autumn was afoot and the North wind  waiting.    And suddenly one day they were all quite gone. And everyone  spoke of the swallows and the South.    \"I think I shall go South myself next year,\" said a hen.    And the year wore on and the swallows came again, and the year  wore on and they sat again on the gables, and all the poultry discussed  the departure of the hen.    And very early one morning, the wind being from the North, the  swallows all soared suddenly and felt the wind in their wings; and a  strength came upon them and a strange old knowledge and a more  than human faith, and flying high they left the smoke of our cities and  small remembered eaves, and saw at last the huge and homeless sea,  and steering by grey sea-currents went southward with the wind. And  going South they went by glittering fog-banks and saw old islands lifting  their heads above them; they saw the slow quests of the wandering  ships, and divers seeking pearls, and lands at war, till there came in  view the mountains that they sought and the sight of the peaks they  knew; and they descended into an austral valley, and saw Summer  sometimes sleeping and sometimes singing song.    \"I think the wind is about right,\" said the hen; and she spread her  wings and ran out of the poultry-yard. And she ran fluttering out on  to the road and some way down it until she came to a garden.    At evening she came back panting.    And in the poultry-yard she told the poultry how she had gone South  as far as the high road, and saw the great world's traffic going by,  and came to lands where the potato grew, and saw the stubble upon  which men live, and at the end of the road had found a garden, and  there were roses in it--beautiful roses!--and the gardener himself was  there with his braces on.    \"How extremely interesting,\" the poultry said, \"and what a really  beautiful description!\"    And the Winter wore away, and the bitter months went by, and the  Spring of the year appeared, and the swallows came again.    \"We have been to the South,\" they said, \"and the valleys beyond  the sea.\"    But the poultry would not agree that there was a sea in the South:  \"You should hear our hen,\" they said.          WIND AND FOG      \"Way for us,\" said the North Wind as he came down the sea on an  errand of old Winter.    And he saw before him the grey silent fog that lay along the tides.    \"Way for us,\" said the North Wind, \"O ineffectual fog, for I am  Winter's leader in his age-old war with the ships.

LOUISE SMYTHE          PREFACE.      This book originated in a series of little reading lessons prepared  for the first grade pupils in the Santa Rosa public schools. The  object of the lessons was three-fold: to provide reading matter for  the little ones who had only a small vocabulary of sight-words; to  acquaint them early with the heroes who have come down to us in song  and story; and to create a desire for literature.    It has been my endeavor to follow Dr. G. Stanley Hall's suggestions in  his monograph, \"How to Teach Reading,\" where he asks for \"true  child-editions, made by testing many children with the work piece-meal  and cutting and adapting the material till it really and closely  fitted the minds and hearts of the children.\"    Various stories were given to the pupils; discussions followed. After  a time the story was produced orally by the children. Notes were made  on expressions used and points of interest dwelt upon. Later the story  was either written on the blackboard or mimeographed and put into the  pupils' hands to read.    It gave great delight to the children to recognize an old friend in a  new dress, and as interest was aroused, but little difficulty was  encountered in recognizing words that were indeed \"new\" in their sight  vocabulary, but old servants in their oral vocabulary.    The spirit of the book may be illustrated by referring to the roast  turkey in the story of The Little Match Girl. The story was told as  dear old Hans Christian Andersen gave it to the little German children  of fifty years ago. But American children have a different idea of the  fowl which graces the table at Christmas time. The story as it came  from the lips of the children referred to the \"turkey,\" and \"goose\"  was used in only one instance. As the story was to appeal to our  children, the word was changed to suit their ideas.    Again, in the story of Red Riding-Hood we preferred to use the German  ending, as it leaves a far happier impression on the minds of the  children than the accepted English version. The incongruity of the  wolf's swallowing whole the grandmother and child does not destroy the  child's enjoyment of the story, while the happy release of both  grandmother and little girl forms a suitable close.    Also, as this old story handed down in so many languages is an  interpretation of one of the Sun myths, it seems better to cling to  the original, especially when it meets so entirely with the child's  approval.    Before presenting the Norse myths for reading, they had been the  subject of many conversations, queries and illustrations. Some were  even dramatized--in a childlike way, of course. Detailed descriptions  of Mt. Ida, Asgard, and some of the principal heroes, were given. But,  though the little audience seemed interested in the introductory  remarks, these never came back when the children were called upon to  reproduce the story. The narrator at once plunged into the story part.  It is for this reason descriptions of heroes and places have been  omitted in these stories. It is thus left for each teacher who uses  this book to employ her own method of introducing the gods of the  hardy Norseman to her pupils.    The following works will be found useful and quite available to most  teachers: Andersen's Norse Mythology, Mabie's Norse Stories, Mara  Pratt's Stories from Norseland, Fiske's Myths and Myth Makers,  Taylor's Primitive Culture, Vol. I.; and Longfellow's Poems.    Hoping these stories will interest other children as they have  interested those who helped build them, I send them forth.    E. LOUISE SMYTHE.    _Santa Rosa, California._          CONTENTS.

[Illustration: THE DUCK'S NEST.]    She sat on the eggs to keep them warm.    At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out.    Only one egg was left. It was a very large one.    At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling.    \"What a big duckling!\" said the old duck. \"He does not look like  us. Can he be a turkey?--We will see. If he does not like the water,  he is not a duck.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              mother         jumped         duckling            splash         swim           bigger            called         began          little      The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond.    [Illustration: THE DUCK TAKES HER DUCKLINGS TO SWIM.]    Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called  the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The  big, ugly duckling swam, too.    The mother duck said, \"He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck.  He will not be so ugly when he is bigger.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              yard          alone         while            noise         hurt          that            eating        know          want    Then she said to the ducklings, \"Come with me. I want you to see the  other ducks. Stay by me and look out for the cat.\"    They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made!    While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly  duckling.    \"Let him alone,\" said the mother duck. \"He did not hurt you.\"    [Illustration: \"HE DID NOT HURT YOU,\" SAID THE MOTHER DUCK.]    \"I know that,\" said the duck, \"but he is so ugly, I bit him.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              lovely        help            there            walked        bushes          afraid    The next duck they met, said, \"You have lovely ducklings. They  are all pretty but one. He is very ugly.\"    [Illustration: \"YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALL PRETTY EXCEPT ONE.\"]    The mother duck said, \"I know he is not pretty. But he is very good.\"    Then she said to the ducklings, \"Now, my dears, have a good time.\"    But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time.    The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him.    The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But  he could not help it.    He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were  afraid and flew away.           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              because       house           would            away          hard            lived    \"It is all because I am so ugly,\" said the duckling. So he ran away.    At night he came to an old house. The house looked as if it would fall  down. It was so old. But the wind blew so hard that the duckling went  into the house.    [Illustration: THE UGLY DUCKLING FINDS THE OLD HOUSE.]    An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.    The old woman said, \"I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs.\"           *       *       *       *       *       *       *              growl         walk            corner        animals    The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl.    The hen said, \"Can you lay eggs?\" The duckling said, \"No.\"    \"Then keep still,\" said the hen. The cat said, \"Can you growl?\"    [Illustration: THE CAT SAID, \"CAN YOU GROWL?\"]    \"No,\" said the duckling.    \"Then keep still,\" said the cat.    And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He  saw a big pond. He said, \"I will have a good swim.\"    But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly.           *       *       *       *       *              summer        away            cake            winter        swans           spring            flew          bread           leaves    The summer went by.    Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a  hard time.    It is too sad to tell what he did all winter.    At last it was spring.    The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now.    One day he flew far away.    [Illustration: \"OH, SEE THE LOVELY SWAN!\"]    Soon he saw three white swans on the lake.    He said, \"I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill  me, for I am so ugly.\"    He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in  the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan.    The other swans came to see him.    The children said, \"Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last  is the best.\"    And they gave him bread and cake.    It was a happy time for the ugly duckling.

I want gold leaves.\"    Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave  it gold leaves.
