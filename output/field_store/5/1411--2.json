Art had its beginning in the lines  indented in clay, perhaps, or hollowed in the wood of family utensils;  after that came crude colouring and drawing.    Among the first serious efforts to draw were the Egyptian square and  pointed things, animals and men. The most that artists of that day  succeeded in doing was to preserve the fashions of the time. Their  drawings tell us that men wore their beards in bags. They show us,  also, many peculiar head-dresses and strange agricultural  implements. Artists of that day put down what they saw, and they saw  with an untrained eye and made the record with an untrained hand; but  they did not put in false details for the sake of glorifying the  subject. One can distinguish a man from a mountain in their work, but  the arms and legs embroidered upon Mathilde's tapestry, or the figures  representing family history on an Oriental rug, are quite as correct  in drawing and as little of a puzzle. As men became more intelligent,  hence spiritualised, they began to express themselves in ideal ways;  to glorify the commonplace; and thus they passed from Egyptian  geometry to gracious lines and beautiful colouring.    Indian pottery was the first development of art in America and it led  to the working of metals, followed by drawing and portraiture. Among  the Americans, as soon as that term ceased to mean Indians, art took a  most distracting turn. Europe was old in pictures, great and  beautiful, when America was worshipping at the shrine of the chromo;  but the chromo served a good turn, bad as it was. It was a link  between the black and white of the admirable wood-cut and the true  colour picture.    Some of the Colonists brought over here the portraits of their  ancestors, but those paintings could not be considered \"American\" art,  nor were those early settlers Americans; but the generation that  followed gave to the world Benjamin West. He left his Mother Country  for England, where he found a knighthood and honours of every kind  awaiting him.    The earliest artists of America had to go away to do their work,  because there was no place here for any men but those engaged in  clearing land, planting corn, and fighting Indians. Sir Benjamin West  was President of the Royal Academy while America was still revelling  in chromos. The artists who remained chose such objects as Davy  Crockett in the trackless forest, or made pictures of the Continental  Congress.    After the chromo in America came the picture known as the \"buckeye,\"  painted by relays of artists. Great canvases were stretched and  blocked off into lengths. The scene was drawn in by one man, who was  followed by \"artists,\" each in turn painting sky, water, foliage,  figures, according to his specialty. Thus whole yards of canvas could  be painted in a day, with more artists to the square inch than are now  employed to paint advertisements on a barn.    The Centennial Exhibition of 1876 came as a glorious flashlight. For  the first time real art was seen by a large part of our nation. Every  farmer took home with him a new idea of the possibilities of drawing  and colour. The change that instantly followed could have occurred in  no other country than the United States, because no other people would  have travelled from the four points of the compass to see such an  exhibition. Thus it was the American's _penchant_ for travel which  first opened to him the art world, for he was conscious even then of  the educational advantages to be found somewhere, although there  seemed to be few of them in the United States.    After the Centennial arose a taste for the painting of \"plaques,\" upon  which were the heads of ladies with strange-coloured hair; of  leather-covered flatirons bearing flowers of unnatural colour, or of  shovels decorated with \"snow scenes.\" The whole nation began to revel  in \"art.\" It was a low variety, yet it started toward a goal which  left the chromo at the rear end of the course, and it was a better  effort than the mottoes worked in worsted, which had till then been  the chief decoration in most homes. If the \"buckeye\" was  hand-painting, this was \"single-hand\" painting, and it did not take a  generation to bring the change about, only a season. After the  Philadelphia exhibition the daughter of the household \"painted a  little\" just as she played the piano \"a little.\" To-day, much less  than a man's lifetime since then, there is in America a universal love  for refined art and a fair technical appreciation of pictures, while  already the nation has worthily contributed to the world of  artists. Sir Benjamin West, Sully, and Sargent are ours: Inness,  Inman, and Trumbull.    The curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York has declared that  portrait-painting must be the means which shall save the modern  artists from their sins. To quote him: \"An artist may paint a bright  green cow, if he is so minded: the cow has no redress, the cow must  suffer and be silent; but human beings who sit for portraits seem to  lean toward portraits in which they can recognise their own features  when they have commissioned an artist to paint them. A man _will_  insist upon even the most brilliant artist painting him in trousers,  for instance, instead of in petticoats, however the artist-whim may  direct otherwise; and a woman is likely to insist that the artist who  paints her portrait shall maintain some recognised shade of brown or  blue or gray when he paints her eye, instead of indulging in a burnt  orange or maybe pink! These personal preferences certainly put a limit  to an artist's genius and keep him from writing himself down a  madman. Thus, in portrait-painting, with the exactions of truth upon  it, lies the hope of art-lovers!\"    It is the same authority who calls attention to the danger that lies  in extremes; either in finding no value in art outside the \"old  masters,\" or in admiring pictures so impressionistic that the objects  in them need to be labelled before they can be recognised.    The true art-lover has a catholic taste, is interested in all forms of  art; but he finds beauty where it truly exists and does not allow the  nightmare of imagination to mislead him. That which is not beautiful  from one point of view or another is not art, but decadence. That  which is technical to the exclusion of other elements remains  technique pure and simple, workmanship--the bare bones of art. A thing  is not art simply because it is fantastic. It may be interesting as  showing to what degree some imaginations can become diseased, but it  is not pleasing nor is it art. There are fully a thousand pictures  that every child should know, since he can hardly know too much of a  good thing; but there is room in this volume only to acquaint him with  forty-eight and possibly inspire him with the wish to look up the  neglected nine hundred and fifty-two.

CAMBRIDGE:  STEREOTYPED AND PRINTED BY JOHN WILSON AND SON.          PREFACE.    Few passages of history are more striking than those which record the  efforts of the earlier French Jesuits to convert the Indians. Full as  they are of dramatic and philosophic interest, bearing strongly on the  political destinies of America, and closely involved with the history of  its native population, it is wonderful that they have been left so long  in obscurity. While the infant colonies of England still clung feebly to  the shores of the Atlantic, events deeply ominous to their future were  in progress, unknown to them, in the very heart of the continent. It  will be seen, in the sequel of this volume, that civil and religious  liberty found strange allies in this Western World.    The sources of information concerning the early Jesuits of New France  are very copious. During a period of forty years, the Superior of the  Mission sent, every summer, long and detailed reports, embodying or  accompanied by the reports of his subordinates, to the Provincial of the  Order at Paris, where they were annually published, in duodecimo  volumes, forming the remarkable series known as the Jesuit Relations.  Though the productions of men of scholastic training, they are simple  and often crude in style, as might be expected of narratives hastily  written in Indian lodges or rude mission-houses in the forest, amid  annoyances and interruptions of all kinds. In respect to the value of  their contents, they are exceedingly unequal. Modest records of  marvellous adventures and sacrifices, and vivid pictures of forest-life,  alternate with prolix and monotonous details of the conversion of  individual savages, and the praiseworthy deportment of some exemplary  neophyte. With regard to the condition and character of the primitive  inhabitants of North America, it is impossible to exaggerate their value  as an authority. I should add, that the closest examination has left me  no doubt that these missionaries wrote in perfect good faith, and that  the Relations hold a high place as authentic and trustworthy historical  documents. They are very scarce, and no complete collection of them  exists in America. The entire series was, however, republished, in 1858,  by the Canadian government, in three large octavo volumes. [1]    [1] Both editions--the old and the new--are cited in the following  pages. Where the reference is to the old edition, it is indicated by the  name of the publisher (Cramoisy), appended to the citation, in brackets.    In extracts given in the notes, the antiquated orthography and  accentuation are preserved.    These form but a part of the surviving writings of the French-American  Jesuits. Many additional reports, memoirs, journals, and letters,  official and private, have come down to us; some of which have recently  been printed, while others remain in manuscript. Nearly every prominent  actor in the scenes to be described has left his own record of events in  which he bore part, in the shape of reports to his Superiors or letters  to his friends. I have studied and compared these authorities, as well  as a great mass of collateral evidence, with more than usual care,  striving to secure the greatest possible accuracy of statement, and to  reproduce an image of the past with photographic clearness and truth.    The introductory chapter of the volume is independent of the rest; but a  knowledge of the facts set forth in it is essential to the full  understanding of the narrative which follows.    In the collection of material, I have received valuable aid from Mr. J.  G. Shea, Rev. Felix Martin, S.J., the AbbÃ©s LaverdiÃ¨re and H. R.  Casgrain, Dr. J. C. TachÃ©, and the late Jacques Viger, Esq.    I propose to devote the next volume of this series to the discovery and  occupation by the French of the Valley of the Mississippi.
