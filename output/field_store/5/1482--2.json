A. FROST,    AUTHOR OF \"FROST'S LETTER-WRITER,\" ETC.    1869        PREFACE.    For a long time the little book which we now offer to the public  has been wanted in the library of the fashionable world; the  customs, the etiquette, the different obligations which society  imposes upon those who live in its midst, change frequently, and  although the general principles are the same, although politeness  and civility are of all epoques and times, nevertheless there are  few persons so entirely at home in all the forms that they do not  on some occasion feel hesitation as to the proper manner of  conducting themselves.    Indeed, besides the broader and more essential rules of  politeness, there are certain conventionalities adopted by good  society, which, sanctioned by custom and absolute obligation,  cannot, without some good reason, be neglected by the truly polite  gentleman or lady. Every day the question is raised whether such  and such a custom is adopted, received, and proper; there will  constantly arise a doubt about the details of some ceremony, the  proper hour for some entertainment, the true etiquette for some  occasion. At such a time, there is a regret felt that there is not  at hand, in one's own library, a safe guide, an experienced  counsellor, who will answer such questions, so trifling in  appearance, so important in reality.    A breach of etiquette, an involuntarily omission of some point of  politeness, may often have a serious influence upon the future of  the perpetrator. None of these little details are to be scorned  they have each and every one a value.    It is to meet the want already mentioned that this little volume  has been prepared. It makes no claim to originality; but its aim  is to be perfectly reliable. English, French, and American  authorities of weight have been consulted, and nothing admitted  that was not sanctioned by experience and the customs of the best  society.    Books, it is very true, have been already written upon this  subject; but they are for the most part filled with useless  details, and often do not contain what is of most importance. The  aim of the Editor of the present work has been to avoid both  extremes, to select only what was useful, reliable, and well  established, and to reject only what was valueless or mere  repetition.    The subjects treated are all classed that they may have easy  reference, and admit of consultation at a moment's notice.    The little book goes forth with one pretension only, one ambition  alone--to be useful.      CONTENTS.

ETIQUETTE AND ITS USES.    THERE are a great many people, in other respects perfectly  estimable (which makes the complaint against them the more  grievous) who maintain that the laws of nature are the only laws  of binding force among the units which compose society. They do  not assert their doctrine in so many words, but practically they  avow it, and they are not slow to express their contempt for the  \"ridiculous etiquette\" which is declared by their opponents to be  essential to the well being of society. These people are probably  a law to themselves in such matters; they obey in their rules of  conduct those instincts of propriety and good manners which were  implanted in them at their birth, and cultivated probably by their  education, and therefore they have small need to study especially  how to conduct themselves in their intercourse with society. In  such cases, their opposition to a written code of manners is  rather an affair of theory than of practice, and it seems rather  absurd that they should so emphatically denounce the system which  they themselves, by example rather than precept, thoroughly carry  out. They would be probably as averse to committing any act of  rudeness, or any breach of politeness as the warmest admirer of  the primitive life of the Indian would be to living himself in a  dirty tent, and eating his food, half cooked, on a forked-stick  over a camp fire. For such people this little code of the \"Laws  and By-Laws of American Society\" is not written.    There are others who are equally fierce in their denunciations of  the ridiculous etiquette above mentioned, but who have not the  same natural excuse for being so. These are the rude, rough  natures, whom no amount of social rubbing, or intercourse with the  most refined would polish, though the professors of the art of  good breeding polished never so wisely. They act in their rules of  conduct on a principle wholly selfish, making their own ease and  comfort the first, if not indeed the sole aim, regardless entirely  of the amount of inconvenience or discomfort they may occasion to  others. They are obliged to cry down, for mere consistency's sake,  the system which condemns their own course of action, and which  gives certain laws for governing the conduct, and certain other  laws prohibiting many of the acts of rudeness which they find so  agreeable, but which others may reasonably object to as offensive.  Such persons, too, will of course freely express their opinion,  yet their denunciations will probably produce an exactly opposite  effect to the one they intend, their own conduct proving the  pernicious influence of their theory. Their abuse will be, not the  expression, half in badinage, of minds protesting by anticipation  against the abuse of forms and ceremonies; but the ignorant  invective of coarse-minded people against a principle that would  tame them, and mould them into a more agreeable presence. They  exclaim loudly against what they personally dislike, however  beneficial it may be either to themselves or others. For them this  little book of the \"Laws and By-Laws of American Society\" is not  written.    Besides the two classes already mentioned, there is another  exceedingly large class of society, which, far from being boorish  by nature, yet from circumstances lacks the cultivation which  alone will bring the conduct into such training as will fit it  practically for exhibition in society. To the persons comprising  this class, it is not only a source of regret, but of absolute  pain, to be ignorant of the rules which make society cohere, which  mark out the functions and duties of the various members which  comprise it, and which guard alike against annoyances from the  impertinent, and intrusions by the ill-bred, promoting by  organized methods the formation of desirable acquaintanceship and  pleasant friendships, which otherwise might never take place.  Isolation from society, the want of proper instruction, the ill  effect of bad example, the advice of the prejudiced, the  association with the low-bred, and a hundred other causes, may  conspire to prevent that intimacy with the cardinal rules of good  behavior, which decorum and good breeding have dictated for the  better guidance of the community. It is for such persons, and for  the many others who, though not unacquainted with the principles  which should guide them in their conduct, are yet often at fault  upon questions of detail, and sometimes commit errors, which are  the more excusable that absolute rules, deduced from precedent and  established by practice alone could set them right, that this code  of Modern Etiquette has been prepared. To them it is offered as  supplying a need which it is their misfortune, rather than their  fault, to experience, in the hope that it will be found to contain  a complete guide for them in the open paths and by-paths too of  good society.    Before beginning to lay down the rules and ordinances of  Etiquette, it will be well to say a few words upon Etiquette  itself.    Etiquette is, in point of fact, nothing more nor less than the  law, written and unwritten, which regulates the society of  civilized people, distinguishing them from the communities of  barbarous tribes, whose lives are hard and their manners still  harder. It is to a well disciplined and refined mind the  fundamental principle of action in all intercourse with society,  and they are interested in maintaining it in its integrity, and  bound to heed and obey its simplest as well as more formal  precepts. The real law-giver is the general convenience, speaking  with authority and the experience of many years; and it will be  found that even in those cases, where the meaning of its rules may  be somewhat obscure at first sight, there is an underlying reason  for the regulation laid down.    Etiquette, like every other human institution, is of course liable  to abuse; it may be transformed from a convenient and wholesome  means of producing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team                        THE KING IN YELLOW    BY    ROBERT W.

Strange is the night where black stars rise,    And strange moons circle through the skies    But stranger still is        Lost Carcosa.      Songs that the Hyades shall sing,    Where flap the tatters of the King,    Must die unheard in        Dim Carcosa.      Song of my soul, my voice is dead;    Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed    Shall dry and die in        Lost Carcosa.    Cassilda's Song in \"The King in Yellow,\" Act i, Scene 2.          THE REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS      I    \"Ne raillons pas les fous; leur folie dure plus longtemps que  la notre.... Voila toute la difference.\"    Toward the end of the year 1920 the Government of the United States had  practically completed the programme, adopted during the last months of  President Winthrop's administration. The country was apparently tranquil.  Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war  with Germany, incident on that country's seizure of the Samoan Islands,  had left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation  of Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over  repeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General  Von Gartenlaube's forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and  Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of  Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a  superb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land  fortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff,  organized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000  men, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent  squadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the  navigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home  waters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to  acknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary  as law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no  longer represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was  prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had  risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white  city which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good  architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for  decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets  had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted,  squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads  built to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine  bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely  surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send  to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera  brought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was  much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the  Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The  Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks  to the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the  latest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born  Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new  independent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new  laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in  the executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the  Government solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry  scouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations  tacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of  War, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal  Congress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves  and kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many  thought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after  all is a world by itself.    But self-preservation is the first law, and the United States had to look  on in helpless sorrow as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium writhed in the  throes of Anarchy, while Russia, watching from the Caucasus, stooped and  bound them one by one.    In the city of New York the summer of 1899 was signalized by the  dismantling of the Elevated Railroads. The summer of 1900 will live in  the memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was  removed in that year. In the following winter began that agitation for  the repeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its final fruit in  the month of April, 1920, when the first Government Lethal Chamber was  opened on Washington Square.    I had walked down that day from Dr. Archer's house on Madison Avenue,  where I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my horse,  four years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in the back of  my head and neck, but now for months they had been absent, and the doctor  sent me away that day saying there was nothing more to be cured in me. It  was hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself. Still I did  not grudge him the money. What I minded was the mistake which he made at  first. When they picked me up from the pavement where I lay unconscious,  and somebody had mercifully sent a bullet through my horse's head, I was  carried to Dr. Archer, and he, pronouncing my brain affected, placed me  in his private asylum where I was obliged to endure treatment for  insanity. At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind  had always been as sound as his, if not sounder, \"paid my tuition\" as he  jokingly called it, and left. I told him, smiling, that I would get even  with him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call  once in a while. I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but  he gave me none, and I told him I would wait.    The fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the  contrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy  young man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and  above all--oh, above all else--ambitious. There was only one thing which  troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.    During my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, _The  King in Yellow_. I remember after finishing the first act that it  occurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book  into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on  the hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening  words in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped  to pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of  terror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every  nerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my  bedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled  with a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that  troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the  heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon,  when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for  ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as  the writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation,  terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth--a world which now  trembles before the King in Yellow. When the French Government seized the  translated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course,  became eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an  infectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent,  barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit,  censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite  principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine  promulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known  standard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art  had been struck in _The King in Yellow_, all felt that human nature  could not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of  purest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act  only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.    It was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first  Government Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington  Square, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The block which  had formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as cafes  and restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in  the winter of 1898. The French and Italian cafes and restaurants were  torn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and  converted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains. In the  centre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in  architecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns  supported the roof, and the single door was of bronze. A splendid marble  group of the \"Fates\" stood before the door, the work of a young American  sculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years  old.    The inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed"]]]
