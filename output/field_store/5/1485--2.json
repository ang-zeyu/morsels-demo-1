THE ARRIVAL OF VAL    In northern Montana there lies a great, lonely stretch of prairie land,  gashed deep where flows the Missouri. Indeed, there are many such--big,  impassive, impressive in their very loneliness, in summer given over to  the winds and the meadow larks and to the shadows fleeing always over the  hilltops. Wild range cattle feed there and grow sleek and fat for the fall  shipping of beef. At night the coyotes yap quaveringly and prowl abroad  after the long-eared jack rabbits, which bounce away at their hunger-driven  approach. In winter it is not good to be there; even the beasts shrink then  from the bleak, level reaches, and shun the still bleaker heights.    But men will live anywhere if by so doing there is money to be gained, and  so a town snuggled up against the northern rim of the bench land, where the  bleakness was softened a bit by the sheltering hills, and a willow-fringed  creek with wild rosebushes and chokecherries made a vivid green background  for the meager huddle of little, unpainted buildings.    To the passengers on the through trains which watered at the red tank near  the creek, the place looked crudely picturesque--interesting, so long as  one was not compelled to live there and could retain a perfectly impersonal  viewpoint. After five or ten minutes spent hi watching curiously the one  little street, with the long hitching poles planted firmly and frequently  down both sides--usually within a very few steps of a saloon door--and the  horses nodding and stamping at the flies, and the loitering figures  that appeared now and then in desultory fashion, many of them imagined  that they understood the West and sympathized with it, and appreciated its  bigness and its freedom from conventions.    One slim young woman had just told the thin-faced school teacher on a  vacation, with whom she had formed one of those evanescent traveling  acquaintances, that she already knew the West, from instinct and from  Manley's letters. She loved it, she said, because Manley loved it, and  because it was to be her home, and because it was so big and so free.  Out here one could think and grow and really live, she declared, with  enthusiasm. Manley had lived here for three years, and his letters, she  told the thin-faced teacher, were an education in themselves.    The teacher had already learned that the slim young woman, with the  yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, was going to marry  Manley--she had forgotten his other name, though the young woman had  mentioned it--and would live on a ranch, a cattle ranch. She smiled with  somewhat wistful sympathy, and hoped the young woman would be happy; and  the young woman waved her hand, with the glove only half pulled on, toward  the shadow-dappled prairie and the willow-fringed creek, and the hills  beyond.    \"Happy!\" she echoed joyously. \"Could one be anything else, in such a  country? And then--you don't know Manley, you see. It's horribly bad form,  and undignified and all that, to prate of one's private affairs, but I just  can't help bubbling over. I'm not looking for heaven, and I expect to have  plenty of bumpy places in the trail--trail is anything that you travel  over, out here; Manley has coached me faithfully--but I'm going to be  happy. My mind is quite made up. Well, good-by--I'm so glad you happened  to be on this train, and I wish I might meet you again. Isn't it a funny  little depot? Oh, yes--thank you! I almost forgot that umbrella, and I  might need it. Yes, I'll write to you--I should hate to drop out of  your mind completely. Address me Mrs. Manley Fleetwood, Hope, Montana.  Good-by--I wish--\"    She trailed off down the aisle with eyes shining, in the wake of the  grinning porter. She hurried down the steps, glanced hastily along the  platform, up at the car window where the faded little school teacher was  smiling wearily down at her, waved her hand, threw a dainty little kiss,  nodded a gay farewell, smiled vaguely at the conductor, who had been  respectfully pleasant to her--and then she was looking at the rear platform  of the receding train mechanically, not yet quite realizing why it was that  her heart went heavy so suddenly. She turned then and looked about her in  a surprised, inquiring fashion. Manley, it would seem, was not at hand to  welcome her. She had expected his face to be the first she looked upon in  that town, but she tried not to be greatly perturbed at his absence; so  many things may detain one.    At that moment a young fellow, whose clothes emphatically proclaimed him a  cowboy, came diffidently up to her, tilted his hat backward an inch or so,  and left it that way, thereby unconsciously giving himself an air of candor  which should have been reassuring.    \"Fleetwood was detained. You were expecting to--you're the lady he was  expecting, aren't you?\"    She had been looking questioningly at her violin box and two trunks  standing on their ends farther down the platform, and she smiled vaguely  without glancing at him.    \"Yes. I hope he isn't sick, or--\"    \"I'll take you over to the hotel, and go tell him you're here,\" he  volunteered, somewhat curtly, and picked up her bag.    \"Oh, thank you.\" This time her eyes grazed his face inattentively. She  followed him down the rough steps of planking and up an extremely dusty  road--one could scarcely call it a street--to an uninviting building with  crooked windows and a high, false front of unpainted boards.    The young fellow opened a sagging door, let her pass into a narrow hallway,  and from there into a stuffy, hopelessly conventional fifth-rate parlor,  handed her the bag, and departed with another tilt of the hat which placed  it at a different angle. The sentence meant for farewell she did not catch,  for she was staring at a wooden-faced portrait upon an easel, the portrait  of a man with a drooping mustache, and porky cheeks, and dead-looking eyes.    \"And I expected bearskin rugs, and antlers on the walls, and big  fireplaces!\" she remarked aloud, and sighed. Then she turned and pulled  aside a coarse curtain of dusty, machine-made lace, and looked after her  guide. He was just disappearing into a saloon across the street, and she  dropped the curtain precipitately, as if she were ashamed of spying. \"Oh,  well--I've heard all cowboys are more or less intemperate,\" she excused,  again aloud.    She sat down upon an atrocious red plush chair, and wrinkled her  nose spitefully at the porky-cheeked portrait. \"I suppose you're the  proprietor,\" she accused, \"or else the proprietor's son. I wish you  wouldn't squint like that. If I have to stop here longer than ten minutes,  I shall certainly turn you face to the wall.\" Whereupon, with another  grimace, she turned her back upon it and looked out of the window. Then she  stood up impatiently, looked at her watch, and sat down again upon the red  plush chair.    \"He didn't tell me whether Manley is sick,\" she said suddenly, with some  resentment. \"He was awfully abrupt in his manner. Oh, you--\" She rose,  picked up an old newspaper from the marble-topped table with uncertain  legs, and spread it ungently over the portrait upon the easel. Then she  went to the window and looked out again. \"I feel perfectly sure that cowboy  went and got drunk immediately,\" she complained, drumming pettishly upon  the glass. \"And I don't suppose he told Manley at all.\"    The cowboy was innocent of the charge, however, and he was doing his  energetic best to tell Manley. He had gone straight through the saloon and  into the small room behind, where a man lay sprawled upon a bed in one  corner. He was asleep, and his clothes were wrinkled as if he had lain  there long. His head rested upon his folded arms, and he was snoring  loudly. The young fellow went up and took him roughly by the shoulder.    \"Here! I thought I told you to straighten up,\" he cried disgustedly. \"Come  alive! The train's come and gone, and your girl's waiting for you over to  the hotel. D' you hear?\"    \"Uh-huh!\" The man opened one eye, grunted, and closed it again.    The other yanked him half off the bed, and swore. This brought both eyes  open, glassy with whisky and sleep. He sat wobbling upon the edge of the  bed, staring stupidly.    \"Can't you get anything through you?\" his tormentor exclaimed. \"You want  your girl to find out you're drunk? You got the license in your pocket.  You're supposed to get spliced this evening--and look at you!\" He turned  and went out to the bartender.    \"Why didn't you pour that coffee into him, like I told you?\" he demanded.  \"We've got to get him steady on his pins _somehow!_\"    The bartender was sprawled half over the bar, apathetically reading"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#1)"],[1,"TRANSCRIBER'S COMMENTS    Where Hebrew letters appeared within the English text, these have been  transliterated and included in brackets.

The _Pirke Abot_ is indeed a classical bit of that ancient Jewish  classic, the _Mishnah_.    The translation in this edition is based largely upon that of Taylor,  in his _Sayings of the Jewish Fathers_, and upon the excellent version  of Singer, in his _Authorized Daily Prayer Book_.    This edition is intended mainly for popular reading, but it has been  thought wise to amplify the notes, especially with bibliographical  references, so that it may serve the purpose of a teacher's handbook,  and also be useful as a text-book for the higher grades of religious  schools and for study circles.  The references are to books that are  generally accessible, and, wherever possible, to books in English.  The notes are by no means intended to be exhaustive, but rather to be  suggestive.    It is the humble hope of the editor that this little book may be the  means of further popularizing the practical and, at the same time,  high-minded wisdom of the \"Fathers\"; that it may serve as an incentive  to a more detailed study of their philosophy of life, and that its  appearance may help us to lead in a revival of that most ancient and  praiseworthy custom of reading the _Pirke Abot_ in the house of  worship on the Sabbath, during the summer months.  Let him into whose  hands these sayings fall \"meditate upon them day and night,\" for \"he  who would be saintly must fulfil the dicta of the Fathers.\"                JOSEPH I GORFINKLE.    Mt. Vernon, N. Y.     February, 1913.                            INTRODUCTION                    NAME    _The Tractate Abot_ (_Massechet Abot_) is the ninth treatise of _The  Order_ or _Series on Damages_ (_Seder Nezikin_), which is the fourth  section of the _Mishnah_ (1).  It is commonly known in Hebrew as  _Pirke Abot_, _The Chapters of the Fathers_, and has also been termed  _Mishnat ha-Chasidim_, _Instruction for the Pious_, because of the  Rabbinic saying, \"He who wishes to be pious, let him practise the  teachings of _Abot_\" (2).  On account of the nature of its contents,  it is generally designated in English as the _Ethics of the Fathers_.  Taylor entitles his edition _Dibre Aboth ha-Olam_, Sayings of the  Fathers of the World_, and has as the English title, _Sayings of the  Jewish Fathers_.  Gustav Gottheil refers to the _Abot_ as the _Sayings  of the Pharisaic Fathers_ (3).  Its German title is generally _Die  Spruche der Vater_, and in French it is usually rendered _Chapitres_  or _Maximes des Peres_.          (1) See _infra_, [Chapter V], n. 61.          (2) _Baba Kamma_, 30a.  See Taylor, _Sayings of the Jewish        Fathers_, p. 3.  Maimonides refers to this saying in the        _Foreword_ of his _Eight Chapters_; see Gorfinkle, _The Eight        Chapters_, etc., p. 34.          (3) See _Sun and Shield_, p. 321 _et passim_.  See _infra_, n.        8, which accounts for the use of \"_Pharisaic_.\"    The use of the word _Abot_ (fathers), in the title, is of very ancient  date.  We can only guess at the reason for its being used, and,  consequently, there are various explanations for it.  Samuel de Uceda,  in his collective commentary, says that as this tractate of the  _Mishnah_ contains the advice and good counsel, which, for the most  part, come from a father, the Rabbis mentioned in it adopt the role of  \"fathers,\" and are therefore so designated.  This explanation does  not, however, deter him from advancing another to the effect that this  treatise is the basis of all subsequent ethical and moral teachings  and doctrines, and the Rabbis are, in consequence, the \"fathers\" or  prototypes of all ethical teachers and moralists (4).  Loeb attributes  its use to the fact that the Rabbis of _Abot_ are the \"fathers\" or  \"ancestors of Rabbinic Judaism\" (5).  Hoffman states that the word  _abot_ means \"teachers of tradition\" (_Traditionslehrer_), and points  to the expression _abot ha-olam_ (_Eduyot_, I. 4), which, translated  literally, is \"fathers of the world,\" but is used to designate the  most distinguished teachers, which is a true characterization of the  Rabbis of _Abot_ (6).  Taylor says in regard to the title, \"It takes  its name from the fact that it consists to a great extent of the  maxims of the Jewish Fathers whose names are mentioned in the pages\"  (7).  Hoffmann's seems the most acceptable explanation.          (4) _Midrash Shemuel_ (ed. Warsaw, 1876), p. 6.  The _Midrash        Shemuel_ is a collective commentary, first published in Venice        in 1579, and which has since passed through six editions.  See        p. 22, n. 21.          (5) _La Chaine_, etc., p. 307, n. 1.          (6) See Hoffman, _Seder Nesikin, Introd._, p. xx, and p. 258,        n. 36.  In this passage of _Eduyot_, Hillel and Shammai are        referred to as _abot ha-olam_; in _Yerushalmi Shekalim_, III,        47b, Rabbi and Ishmael and Rabbi Akiba, and in _Yerushalmi        Chagigah_, II, 77d, all the pairs of _Abot_ I are similarly        designated.          (7) Taylor, _loc. cit._                      PURPOSE    The original aim of _Abot_ was to show the divine source and authority  of the traditional law revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and to  demonstrate its continuity from Moses through Joshua, the elders, and  the men of the Great Synagogue, down to those Rabbis who lived during  the period between 200 B.C.E. to 200 C.E.  Loeb maintains that _Abot_  was originally a composition of the Pharisaic Rabbis who wished to  indicate that the traditions held and expounded by them, and which the  Sadducees repudiated, were divine and, in time and sequence,  uninterruptedly authoritative (8).  This line of continuous tradition  is plainly seen in the first two chapters.  A second and probably  later purpose was to present a body of practical maxims and aphorisms  for the daily guidance of the people.            (8) _La Chaine_, etc.  The Sadducees belonged to the priestly        and aristocratic families.  They made light of the oral        traditions, did not believe in the future life, and were        indifferent to the independence of the Jewish nation.  The        Pharisees, on the other hand, were constituted largely from        the common people; they were believers in, and strict        observers of, the traditional laws, and were ardent        nationalists.  The bitter attack of Jesus on them, which has        resulted in making the word \"Pharisee\" synonymous with        \"hypocrite\" and \"self-righteous person,\" was, to say the        least, unjust, as Herford has so lucidly pointed out in his        sympathetic study of the Pharisees.  Herford, though not a        Jew, has taken up the cudgels most ably in defence of this        sect, with remarkable insight into the life and literature of        the ancient Jews.  He demonstrates conclusively that though        there were hypocrites among the Pharisees, as among all        classes and creeds, yet the average Pharisee was a man of the        most elevated religious ideals, who misunderstood Jesus, but        who, in turn was misunderstood by him.
