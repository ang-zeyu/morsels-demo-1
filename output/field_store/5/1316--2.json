Smith, Jr.    Salt Lake City    1909        INTRODUCTION.    During the summer of 1906 and continuing until the summer of 1907,  a number of Reorganite ministers who were engaged in missionary  work in Salt Lake City and Ogden, were greatly encouraged by one or  two apostates and the local anti-\"Mormon\" press. Their method of  proselyting was of the usual nature, a tirade of abuse and false  accusation hurled at the authorities of the Church. Encouraged  by the anti-\"Mormon\" help, they became extremely vindictive in  their references to President Brigham Young and the present Church  authorities. Their sermons were so bitter and malignant--which has been  the character of most of their work from the beginning, in Utah--that  they raised considerable protest from many respectable citizens. Even  non-\"Mormons\" declared that in no other community would such vicious  attacks be tolerated. It appeared at times that these missionaries were  attempting to provoke the \"Mormon\" people to some act of violence,  that it might be seized upon and published to the world through the  anti-\"Mormon\" press that they had been mobbed, and thus capital for  their cause be made of it. Fortunately they were not molested to the  credit of the people so constantly abused. One of these meetings was  attended by a prominent gentleman from the East who was somewhat  acquainted with Utah and her people, he said, in conversation with the  writer a few days later, that never in his experience has he witnessed  such a thing before. \"If that fellow\"--referring to a Reorganite who  has since been promoted in his church--\"should come to our town and  abuse the ministers of our church, calling them murderers, thieves and  liars, as he did Brigham Young and your churchmen, we would kick him  off the streets.\"    While this agitation was going on, a number of the young people of  Ogden appealed to their stake presidency asking that some reply to  those assaults be made for the benefit of those who were not grounded  in the faith, and in danger of being deceived. Acting on this request  the presidency of the Weber Stake invited the writer to speak along  these lines in the Ogden Tabernacle. The invitation was accepted and  two discourses were delivered, the first, March 10, 1907, on the  subject of the \"Origin of the Reorganized Church,\" and the other  April 28, 1907, on the question of \"Succession.\" These remarks were  subsequently published in the _Deseret News_, and many requests were  received asking that they be published in pamphlet form, where they  could be preserved by those who had to meet the ministers of the  \"Reorganization.\" An edition was therefore published in the summer  of 1907, which has been disposed of, evidently without supplying the  demand, for in the summer of 1909 the orders for the pamphlet were so  great that is was deemed necessary to issue a second edition. In the  meantime a reply appeared in the Saints' Herald, commencing with the  issue of June 30, and ending that of July 21, 1909. This reply will be  remembered more for the unfair way matters were treated and the fact  that the greater part of the evidence was left untouched, than for any  merit in the argument presented. Wherever it was deemed necessary, for  the sake of those who may be deceived, answers are given in this work  in footnote references to the argument set forth in the Reorganite  \"defense.\" However, there was nothing presented in the \"defense\"  that really required any reply; by reading carefully the discourses  mentioned, the ordinary reader can readily perceive the trickery,  deception and sophistry, of the Reorganite reply.    Part one of this book contains the discourse delivered in Ogden on  the \"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church;\" part two contains the  discourse on the \"Succession in the Presidency,\" and part three deals  with the most prominent differences existing between the Church and  the \"Reorganization,\" wherein they accuse us of departing from the  doctrines of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This matter in part three is  added by request of a number of parties who have had to meet the  sophistry of the Reorganite missionaries.    This book is not put forth to replace any other work, neither with the  idea that it will turn Reorganite ministers from the folly of their  ways; but with the hope that some honest soul who have been deceived  may see the light and embrace the truth, and that the feet of the  weak may be strengthened in the path of righteousness that they may  not falter on their way. Neither is it intended to be an exhaustive  treatise in of the subjects it contains; the idea has been in the main,  to present matters that have not been treated elsewhere.--J. F. S., Jr.        ORIGIN OF THE \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.    The Question of Rejection--Salvation for the Dead    * * * * *    Remarks made in the Weber Stake Tabernacle, Ogden City, March 10, 1907,  by Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr.    * * * * *    My beloved brethren and sisters and friends: The great majority of  you who are assembled here today are, without doubt, members of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I suppose that most of  you have a divine testimony of the truth of this latter-day work--the  Gospel of Christ--which we have received. To you who have a testimony,  my remarks shall not be addressed particularly, but if you will bear  with me in what I have to say that I may be led to say something that  will strengthen the faith of those who may be weak, or that will  encourage those who have no faith at all, I will feel amply paid.    I am not here for the purpose of assailing any man for his religion,  for we Latter-day Saints hold that every man is entitled to his  religious views and should have the privilege of worshiping according  to the dictates of his conscience, let him worship, how, where, or what  he may. And we will protect him in this right. But we are opposed to  the custom adopted by certain men who travel through the settlements  of our people abusing the authorities of the Church, distorting our  doctrines and defaming the dead, for the purpose of destroying the  faith and confidence of the Latter-day Saints. Therefore in treating  the subject of the \"Reorganized\" Church this afternoon, it will be in  the spirit of self-defense.    We will first consider the statement made by the senior senator from  Michigan, Mr. Burrows, in his speech delivered in the United States  Senate on the 11th of last December. After stating that the membership  of the Church at the martyrdom in 1844, was 50,000 adherents, he  continues:        \"The death of Joseph Smith in 1844, carried dismay and      demoralization throughout the entire membership of the Mormon      Church, scattering its adherents in divers directions and for the      time being seemed to presage the complete overthrow and dissolution      of the organization. Recovering, however, from the shock, the      scattered bands soon reappeared in various parts of the country      and promulgated their doctrines with increased zeal, and set to      work to reassemble and reorganize their scattered forces, resulting      finally in the formation of what is now known and recognized as      the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with      headquarters at Lamoni, Iowa, and presided over by Joseph Smith, a      son of the prophet.\"    He continues:        \"During this period of disintegration one Brigham Young, who      had identified himself with the 'Mormon Organization' as early      as 1832, a man of indomitable will and undaunted courage, bold      and unscrupulous, seized upon the occasion of the demoralization      incident to the death of the prophet to place himself at the head      of some 5,000 Mormons, and marching over desert and mountain,      established himself with his adherents in the valley of Salt      Lake, July 24, 1847, then Mexican territory, where he undoubtedly      indulged the hope that the new doctrine of polygamy about to be      publicly proclaimed by him might be promulgated with impunity      and practiced and maintained without interference by the United      States.\"[1]    Now, this is not true. The senior senator from Michigan has here stated  the position of the \"Reorganized\" Church as capably and clearly as any  member of that sect could possibly have done, and in exactly the same  way that they have stated it for the past forty-seven years. Why he was  led to make such a statement he best may know, but it shows the careful  coaching that he has received by members of the \"Reorganized\" Church in  their opposition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    In a pamphlet published by that organization in 1864, the following  appears:        \"The greater portion of the Church did not follow this Brigham      Young, and in obedience to the revelation in relation to gathering,      remained around about the land of Zion, waiting for the Lord to      again reveal Himself; and today where there is one Saint who was in      the Church in the days of Joseph the martyr, now associated with      Brigham Young, there are ten of those old members standing aloof or      rejoicing under the administration of the word of the Lord through      his son Joseph.\"      SAINTS FOLLOWED PRESIDENT YOUNG.    And this is not true. Now I intend to show that at the martyrdom the  Latter-day Saints followed President Brigham Young and the Twelve. And  too, in accordance with divine revelation. For we learn in the Doctrine  and Covenants that the quorum of Apostles is equal in authority with  the First Presidency and it is their right to take the lead of Church  affairs and the presidency in the absence of the First Presidency, or  when that quorum is invaded by the death of the President of the Church.    At the time of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#1)"],[1,"of the Union Addresses of Harry S. Truman        The addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***    Dates of addresses by Harry S. Truman in this eBook:      January 21, 1946    January 6, 1947    January 7, 1948    January 5, 1949    January 4, 1950    January 8, 1951    January 9, 1952    January 7, 1953        ***    State of the Union Address  Harry S. Truman  January 21, 1946    To the Congress of the United States:    A quarter century ago the Congress decided that it could no longer consider  the financial programs of the various departments on a piecemeal basis.  Instead it has called on the President to present a comprehensive Executive  Budget. The Congress has shown its satisfaction with that method by  extending the budget system and tightening its controls. The bigger and  more complex the Federal Program, the more necessary it is for the Chief  Executive to submit a single budget for action by the Congress.    At the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general  program of the Government are actually inseparable. The president bears the  responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of  proposals on all Government activities and their financing. In formulating  policies, as in preparing budgetary estimates, the Nation and the Congress  have the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views  of the various departments and agencies to form a unified program. And that  program requires consideration in connection with the Budget, which is the  annual work program of the Government.    Since our programs for this period which combines war liquidation with  reconversion to a peacetime economy are inevitably large and numerous it is  imperative that they be planned and executed with the utmost efficiency and  the utmost economy. We have cut the war program to the maximum extent  consistent with national security. We have held our peacetime programs to  the level necessary to our national well-being and the attainment of our  postwar objectives. Where increased programs have been recommended, the  increases have been held as low as is consistent with these goals. I can  assure the Congress of the necessity of these programs. I can further  assure the Congress that the program as a whole is well within our capacity  to finance it. All the programs I have recommended for action are included  in the Budget figures.    For these reasons I have chosen to combine the customary Message on the  State of the Union with the annual Budget Message, and to include in the  Budget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress, but  also for those which I recommend for its action.    I am also transmitting herewith the Fifth Quarterly Report of the Director  of War Mobilization and Reconversion.[1] It is a comprehensive discussion of  the present state of the reconversion program and of the immediate and  long-range needs and recommendations.    [Footnote 1: The report dated January 1, 1946, and entitled \"Battle for  Production\" is printed in House Document 398 (79th Cong., 2d sess.).]    This constitutes, then, as complete a report as I find it possible to  prepare now. It constitutes a program of government in relation to the  Nation's needs.    With the growing responsibility of modern government to foster economic  expansion and to promote conditions that assure full and steady employment  opportunities, it has become necessary to formulate and determine the  Government program in the light of national economic conditions as a whole.  In both the executive and the legislative branches we must make  arrangements which will permit us to formulate the Government program in  that light. Such an approach has become imperative if the American  political and economic system is to succeed under the conditions of  economic instability and uncertainty which we have to face. The Government  needs to assure business, labor, and agriculture that Government policies  will take due account of the requirements of a full employment economy. The  lack of that assurance would, I believe, aggravate the economic  instability.    With the passage of a full employment bill which I confidently anticipate  for the very near future, the executive and legislative branches of  government will be empowered to devote their best talents and resources in  subsequent years to preparing and acting on such a program.    I. FROM WAR TO PEACE--THE YEAR    OF DECISION    In his last Message on the State of the Union, delivered one year ago,  President Roosevelt said:    \"This new year of 1945 can be the greatest year of achievement in human  history.    \"1945 can see the final ending of the Nazi-Fascist reign of terror in  Europe.    \"1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center  of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.    \"Most important of all--1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of  the organization of world peace.\"    All those hopes, and more, were fulfilled in the year 1945. It was the  greatest year of achievement in human history. It saw the end of the  Nazi-Fascist terror in Europe, and also the end of the malignant power of  Japan. And it saw the substantial beginning of world organization for  peace. These momentous events became realities because of the steadfast  purpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom  under their flags. The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 1945 by  the United Nations.    Our own part in this accomplishment was not the product of any single  service. Those who fought on land, those who fought on the sea, and those  who fought in the air deserve equal credit. They were supported by other  millions in the armed forces who through no fault of their own could not go  overseas and who rendered indispensable service in this country. They were  supported by millions in all levels of government, including many  volunteers, whose devoted public service furnished basic organization and  leadership. They were also supported by the millions of Americans in  private life--men and women in industry, in commerce, on the farms, and in  all manner of activity on the home front--who contributed their brains and  their brawn in arming, equipping, and feeding them. The country was brought  through four years of peril by an effort that was truly national in  character.    Everlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those  brave men who did not come back, who will never come back--the 330,000 who  died that the Nation might live and progress. All Americans will also  remain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of  soldiers, sailors, and marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their  service. They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be forgotten  or their needs neglected.    The beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and  deservedly confident. We have a record of enormous achievements as a  democratic society in solving problems and meeting opportunities as they  developed. We find ourselves possessed of immeasurable advantages--vast and  varied natural resources; great plants, institutions, and other facilities;  unsurpassed technological and managerial skills; an alert, resourceful, and  able citizenry. We have in the United States Government rich resources in  information, perspective, and facilities for doing whatever may be found  necessary to do in giving support and form to the widespread and  diversified efforts of all our people.    And for the immediate future the business prospects are generally so  favorable that there is danger of such feverish and opportunistic activity  that our grave postwar problems may be neglected. We need to act now with  full regard for pitfalls; we need to act with foresight and balance. We  should not be lulled by the immediate alluring prospects into forgetting  the fundamental complexity of modern affairs, the catastrophe that can come  in this complexity, or the values that can be wrested from it.    But the long-range difficulties we face should no more lead to despair than  our immediate business prospects should lead to the optimism which comes  from the present short-range prospect. On the foundation of our victory we  can build a lasting peace, with greater freedom and security for mankind in  our country and throughout the world. We will more certainly do this if we  are constantly aware of the fact that we face crucial issues and prepare  now to meet them.    To achieve success will require both boldness in setting our sights and  caution in steering our way on an uncharted course. But we have no luxury  of choice. We must move ahead. No return to the past is possible.    Our Nation has always been a land of great opportunities for those people  of the world who sought to become part of us. Now we have become a land of  great responsibilities to all the people of all the world. We must squarely  recognize and face the fact of those responsibilities. Advances in science,  in communication, in transportation, have compressed the world into a  community. The economic and political health of each member of the world  community bears directly on the economic and political health of each other  member.    The evolution of centuries has brought us to a new era in world history in  which manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and  developed in new and intricate ways.    The United Nations Organization now being established represents a minimum  essential beginning. It must be developed rapidly and steadily. Its work  must be amplified to fill in the whole pattern that has been outlined.  Economic collaboration, for example, already charted, now must be carried  on as carefully and as comprehensively as the political and security  measures.    It is important that the nations come together as States in the Assembly  and in the"]]]
