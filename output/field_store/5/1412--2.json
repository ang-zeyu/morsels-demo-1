Frederick Collins, Inventor of the Wireless  Telephone, 1899. Awarded Gold Medal for same, Alaska Yukon Pacific  Exposition, 1909.]          THE RADIO AMATEUR'S HAND BOOK    A Complete, Authentic and Informative Work on Wireless Telegraphy and  Telephony    BY    A. FREDERICK COLLINS    Inventor of the Wireless Telephone 1899; Historian of Wireless  1901-1910; Author of \"Wireless Telegraphy\" 1905            TO    WILLIAM MARCONI    INVENTOR OF THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH          INTRODUCTION      Before delving into the mysteries of receiving and sending messages  without wires, a word as to the history of the art and its present day  applications may be of service. While popular interest in the subject  has gone forward by leaps and bounds within the last two or three  years, it has been a matter of scientific experiment for more than a  quarter of a century.    The wireless telegraph was invented by William Marconi, at Bologna,  Italy, in 1896, and in his first experiments he sent dot and dash  signals to a distance of 200 or 300 feet. The wireless telephone was  invented by the author of this book at Narberth, Penn., in 1899, and  in his first experiments the human voice was transmitted to a distance  of three blocks.    The first vital experiments that led up to the invention of the  wireless telegraph were made by Heinrich Hertz, of Germany, in 1888  when he showed that the spark of an induction coil set up electric  oscillations in an open circuit, and that the energy of these waves  was, in turn, sent out in the form of electric waves. He also showed  how they could be received at a distance by means of a ring detector,  which he called a _resonator_    In 1890, Edward Branly, of France, showed that metal filings in a tube  cohered when electric waves acted on them, and this device he termed a  _radio conductor_; this was improved upon by Sir Oliver Lodge, who  called it a coherer. In 1895, Alexander Popoff, of Russia, constructed  a receiving set for the study of atmospheric electricity, and this  arrangement was the earliest on record of the use of a detector  connected with an aerial and the earth.    Marconi was the first to connect an aerial to one side of a spark gap  and a ground to the other side of it. He used an induction coil to  energize the spark gap, and a telegraph key in the primary circuit to  break up the current into signals. Adding a Morse register, which  printed the dot and dash messages on a tape, to the Popoff receptor he  produced the first system for sending and receiving wireless telegraph  messages.    [Illustration: Collins' Wireless Telephone Exhibited at the Madison  Square Garden, October 1908.]    After Marconi had shown the world how to telegraph without connecting  wires it would seem, on first thought, to be an easy matter to  telephone without wires, but not so, for the electric spark sets up  damped and periodic oscillations and these cannot be used for  transmitting speech. Instead, the oscillations must be of constant  amplitude and continuous. That a direct current arc light transforms a  part of its energy into electric oscillations was shown by Firth and  Rogers, of England, in 1893.    The author was the first to connect an arc lamp with an aerial and a  ground, and to use a microphone transmitter to modulate the sustained  oscillations so set up. The receiving apparatus consisted of a  variable contact, known as a _pill-box_ detector, which Sir Oliver  Lodge had devised, and to this was connected an Ericsson telephone  receiver, then the most sensitive made. A later improvement for  setting up sustained oscillations was the author's _rotating  oscillation arc_.    Since those memorable days of more than two decades ago, wonderful  advances have been made in both of these methods of transmitting  intelligence, and the end is as yet nowhere in sight. Twelve or  fifteen years ago the boys began to get fun out of listening-in to  what the ship and shore stations were sending and, further, they began  to do a little sending on their own account. These youngsters, who  caused the professional operators many a pang, were the first wireless  amateurs, and among them experts were developed who are foremost in  the practice of the art today.    Away back there, the spark coil and the arc lamp were the only known  means for setting up oscillations at the sending end, while the  electrolytic and crystal detectors were the only available means for  the amateur to receive them. As it was next to impossible for a boy to  get a current having a high enough voltage for operating an  oscillation arc lamp, wireless telephony was out of the question for  him, so he had to stick to the spark coil transmitter which needed  only a battery current to energize it, and this, of course, limited  him to sending Morse signals. As the electrolytic detector was  cumbersome and required a liquid, the crystal detector which came into  being shortly after was just as sensitive and soon displaced the  former, even as this had displaced the coherer.    A few years ahead of these amateurs, that is to say in 1905, J. A.  Fleming, of England, invented the vacuum tube detector, but ten more  years elapsed before it was perfected to a point where it could  compete with the crystal detector. Then its use became general and  workers everywhere sought to, and did improve it. Further, they found  that the vacuum tube would not only act as a detector, but that if  energized by a direct current of high voltage it would set up  sustained oscillations like the arc lamp, and the value of sustained  oscillations for wireless telegraphy as well as wireless telephony had  already been discovered.    The fact that the vacuum tube oscillator requires no adjustment of its  elements, that its initial cost is much less than the oscillation arc,  besides other considerations, is the reason that it popularized  wireless telephony; and because continuous waves have many advantages  over periodic oscillations is the reason the vacuum tube oscillator is  replacing the spark coil as a wireless telegraph transmitter.  Moreover, by using a number of large tubes in parallel, powerful  oscillations can be set up and, hence, the waves sent out are radiated  to enormous distances.    While oscillator tubes were being experimented with in the research  laboratories of the General Electric, the Westinghouse, the Radio  Corporation of America, and other big companies, all the youthful  amateurs in the country had learned that by using a vacuum tube as a  detector they could easily get messages 500 miles away. The use of  these tubes as amplifiers also made it possible to employ a loud  speaker, so that a room, a hall, or an out-of-door audience could hear  clearly and distinctly everything that was being sent out.    The boy amateur had only to let father or mother listen-in, and they  were duly impressed when he told them they were getting it from KDKA  (the Pittsburgh station of the Westinghouse Co.), for was not  Pittsburgh 500 miles away! And so they, too, became enthusiastic  wireless amateurs. This new interest of the grown-ups was at once met  not only by the manufacturers of apparatus with complete receiving and  sending sets, but also by the big companies which began broadcasting  regular programs consisting of music and talks on all sorts of  interesting subjects.    This is the wireless, or radio, as the average amateur knows it today.  But it is by no means the limit of its possibilities. On the contrary,  we are just beginning to realize what it may mean to the human race.  The Government is now utilizing it to send out weather, crop and  market reports. Foreign trade conditions are being reported. The Naval  Observatory at Arlington is wirelessing time signals.    Department stores are beginning to issue programs and advertise by  radio! Cities are also taking up such programs, and they will  doubtless be included soon among the regular privileges of the  tax-payers. Politicians address their constituents. Preachers reach  the stay-at-homes. Great singers thrill thousands instead of hundreds.  Soon it will be possible to hear the finest musical programs,  entertainers, and orators, without budging from one's easy chair.    In the World War wireless proved of inestimable value. Airplanes,  instead of flying aimlessly, kept in constant touch with headquarters.  Bodies of troops moved alertly and intelligently. Ships at sea talked  freely, over hundreds of miles. Scouts reported. Everywhere its  invisible aid was invoked.    In time of peace, however, it has proved and will prove the greatest  servant of mankind. Wireless messages now go daily from continent to  continent, and soon will go around the world with the same facility.  Ships in distress at sea can summon aid. Vessels everywhere get the  day's news, even to baseball scores. Daily new tasks are being  assigned this tireless, wireless messenger.    Messages have been sent and received by moving trains, the Lackawanna  and the Rock Island railroads being pioneers in this field. Messages  have also been received by automobiles, and one inventor has  successfully demonstrated a motor car controlled entirely by wireless.  This method of communication is being employed more and more by  newspapers. It is also of great service in reporting forest fires.    Colleges are beginning to take up the subject, some of the first being  Tufts College, Hunter College, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia,  which have regularly organized departments for students in wireless.

The Secrets of the German War Office  Dr. Armgaard Karl Graves  with the collabaration of  Edward Lyell Fox      FOREWORD    In view of the general war into which Europe has been precipitated  just at the moment of going to press, it is of particular interest to  note that the completed manuscript of this book has been in the hands  of the publishers since June 1st.  Further comment on Dr. Graves'  qualifications to speak authoritatively is unnecessary; the chapters  that follow are a striking commentary on his sources of information.    The Publishers  August 7, 1914.      Chapter I. How I Became a Secret Agent    _\"O Jerum, jerum, jerum, quÃ¢ motatio rerum.\"_    Half past three was heard booming from some clock tower on the twelfth  day of June, 1913, when Mr. King, the Liberal representative from  Somerset, was given the floor in the House of Commons.  Mr. King  proceeded to make a sensation.    He demanded that McKinnon Wood, the House Secretary for Scotland,  reveal to the House the secrets of the strange case of Armgaard Karl  Graves, German spy.    A brief word of explanation may be necessary.  Supposed to be serving  a political sentence in a Scotch prison, I had amazed the English  press and people by publicly announcing my presence in New York City.    Mr. King asked if I was still undergoing imprisonment for espionage;  if not, when and why I was released and whether I had been or would be  deported at the end of my term of imprisonment as an undesirable  alien.    Permit me to quote verbatim from the Edinburgh _Scotsman_ of June 12,  1913:    The Secretary for Scotland replied--Graves was released in December  last.  It would not be in accordance with precedent to state reasons  for the exercise of the prerogative.  I have no official knowledge of  his nationality.  The sentence did not include any recommendation in  favor of deportation.    Mr. King--Was he released because of the state of his health?    The Secretary for Scotland--I believe he was in bad health, but I  cannot give any other answer.    Mr. King--Were any conditions imposed at the time of his release?    The Secretary for Scotland--I think I have dealt with that in my  answer.  (Cries of \"No.\")    Mr. King--Can the right hon. gentleman be a little more explicit?  (Laughter.) We are anxious to have the truth.  Unless the right  hon. gentleman can give me an explicit answer as to whether any  conditions were imposed I will put down the question again.  (Laughter.)    The Speaker intervened at this stage, and the subject dropped.    Heckling began at this point; word was quickly sent to the Speaker,  and he intervened, ruling the subject closed.    Now consider the Secretary for Scotland's statement.  \"It would not be  in accordance with precedent to state reasons for the exercise of  prerogative.\"  In other words, high officials in Enghand had found it  advisable secretly to release me from Barlinney Prison by using the  royal prerogative.  Why?  Later you will know.    Also, consider the Secretary for Scotland's statement that he had no  official knowledge as to my _nationality_--significant that, as you  will realize.    There are three things which do not concern the reader: My origin,  nationality and morals.  There are three persons alive who know who I  am.  One of the three is the greatest ruler in the world.  None of the  three, for reasons of his own, is likely to reveal my identity.    I detest sensationalism and wish it clearly understood that this is no  studied attempt to create mystery.  There is a certain dead line which  no one can cross with impunity and none but a fool would attempt to.  Powerful governments have found it advisable to keep silence regarding  my antecedents.  A case in point occurred when McKinnon Wood,  Secretary for Scotland, refused in the House of Commons to give any  information whatsoever about me, this after pressure had been brought  to bear on him by three mernbers of Parliament.  Either the Home  Secretary knew nothing about my antecedents, or his trained discretion  counseled silence.    I was brought up in the traditions of a house actively engaged in the  affairs of its country, for hundreds of years.  As an only son, I was  promptly and efficiently spoiled for anything else but the station in  life which should have been mine--but never has been and, now, never  can be.  I used to have high aspirations, but promises never kept  shattered most of my ideals.  The hard knocks of life have made me a  fatalist, so now I shrug my shoulders.  _\"Che sara sara.\"_ I have had  to lead my own life and, all considered, I have enjoyed it.  I have  crowded into thirty-nine years more sensations than fall to the lot of  the average half a dozen men.    Following the custom of our house, I was trained as a military cadet.  This military apprenticeship was followed by three years at a famous  _gymnasium_, which fitted me for one of the old classic universities  of Europe.  And after spending six semesters there, I took my degrees  in philosophy and medicine.  Not a bad achievement, I take it, for a  young chap before reaching his twenty-second birthday.  I have always  been fond of study and had a special aptitude for sciences and the  languages.  On one occasion I acquired a fair knowledge of Singalese  and Tamul in three months.    From the university I returned home.  I had always been obstinate and  willful, not to say pigheaded, and being steeped in tales of wrongs  done to my house and country, and with the crass assurance of a young  sprig fresh from untrammeled university life, I began to give vent to  utterances that were not at all to the liking of the powers that were.  Soon making myself objectionable, paying no heed to their protests,  and one thing leading to another, my family found it advisable to send  me into utter and complete oblivion.  To them I am dead, and all said  and done, I would rather have it so.    After the complete rupture of my home ties, I began some desultory  globe trotting.  I knocked about in out-of-the-way corners, where I  observed and absorbed all sorts of things which became very useful in  my subsequent career.  A native, and by that I mean an inhabitant, of  non-European countries always fascinated me, and I soon learned the  way of disarming their suspicion and winning their confidence--a  proceeding very difficult to a European.  After a time I found myself  in Australia and New Zealand, where I traveled extensively, and came  to like both countries thoroughly.  I have never been in the western  part of the United States, but from what I have heard and read I  imagine that the life there more closely resembles the clean, healthy,  outdoor life of the Australians than any other locality.    I was just on the point of beginning extensive travels in the South  Sea Islands, when the situation in South Africa became ominous.  War  seemed imminent, and following my usual bent of sticking my nose in  where I was not wanted I made tracks for this potential seat of  trouble.  I caught the first steamer for Cape Town landing there a  month before the outbreak of war.  On horseback I made my way in easy  stages up to the Rand.  Here happened one of those incidents, which,  although small in itself, alters the course of one's life.  What took  place when I rode into a small town on the Rand known as Doorn Kloof  one chilly misty morning, was written in the bowl of fate.    Doorn Kloof is well named; it means \"the hoof of the Devil.\"  A  straggling collection of corrugated iron shanties set in the middle of  a grayish sandy plain as barren of vegetation as the shores of the  Dead Sea, sweltering hot an hour after sunrise, chilly cold an hour  after sunset, populated by about four hundred Boers of the old  narrow-minded ultra Dutch type with as much imagination as a  grasshopper--that is Doorn Kloof.    When I rode into the village I was in a decidedly bad temper.  Hungry,  wet to the skin, the dismal aspect of the place, the absence of  anything resembling a hotel, the incivility of the inhabitants, all  contributed to shorten my, by no means long, temper.  I was ripe for a  row.  As I rode down the solitary street I found a big burly _Dopper_  flogging brutally a half-grown native boy.  This humanitarian had the  usual Boer view that the sambrock is more effective than the Bible as  a civilizing medium.  After convincing him of the technical error of  his method, I attended to the black boy, whose back was as raw as a  beefsteak.  Kim completely adopted me and he is with me still.  I  christened him Kim, after Kipling's hero, for his Basuto name is  unpronounceable.  He has repaid me often for what he considers the  saving or his life.  Not many months later Kim was the unconscious  cause of a radical change in my destiny.  I have ceased to wonder at  such things.    By the time Kim had learned sorne of the duties of a body servant we  had reached Port Natal.  War had broken out and I volunteered with a  Natal field force in a medical capacity.  Field hospital work took me  where the fighting was thickest.  During the battle of the Modder  River among the first of the wounded brought in was one of the many  foreign officers fighting on the Boer side.  It was Kim who found him.  This officer's wound was fairly serious and necessitated close  attention.  Through chance remarks dropped here and there, the officer  placed my identity correctly.  It developed that he was Major Freiherr  von Reitzenstein, one of the few who knew the real reasons of my  exile.    In one of our innumerable chats that grew out of our growing intimacy,  he suggested my entering the service of Germany in a political  capacity.  He urged that with my training and social connections I had  exceptional equipment for such work.  Moreover, he suggested that my  service on political missions would give me the knowledge and  influence necessary to"]]]
