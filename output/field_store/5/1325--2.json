Today, airships of the non-rigid type are taking on a new responsibility  to the nation.

LITCHFIELD      An industrial leader, chairman of the Goodyear board, who has      believed for 30 years that airships would prove useful to his      country in peace or war]          Foreword      High admirals of the American fleet faced in 1940 the gravest  responsibility in the National Defense the Navy had ever known. Wherever  they turned, north, east, south, west, perils lurked. If they swung  their binoculars toward Iceland, toward the Caribbean, toward Singapore,  Alaska, or the Canal, everywhere waited potential threats against our  American way of life, which they must meet with ships and men, with guns  and stout hearts. This was not merely national defense, perhaps not even  hemisphere defense, it was World War.    Surveying their gigantic task, and moving swiftly to meet it, they found  a place in their program for half forgotten craft, long over-shadowed by  other arms of the fleet, the non-rigid airship, sometimes called a  dirigible, but more often a \"blimp.\"    Couldn't the airship be used as a watchdog along the coast, against  enemy submarines, in discovering enemy mines--relieve for sterner tasks  the destroyers and other craft now wallowing their innards out in those  restless shallow waters? Great Britain and France had used airships  effectively in this service over the English Channel during the last  war.    The areas within their patrol range, a hundred or 200 miles out to sea,  within the 100 fathom curve, was a vital one. There steamship lanes  converge, great harbors lie, coastwise merchantmen cruise, there is the  greatest concentration of military and commercial shipping.    With depth bombs and machine guns the blimps might strike a stout blow  of their own, even if they weren't rated as combat craft. At least they  could sound the alarm, call out reinforcements from swift moving  shore-based craft, keep the intruder under surveillance. After all the  main thing was to find the submarines in those endless miles of water.  And in this field the very slowness of the airship, as compared to the  airplane, would be an advantage, permit a more thorough search of the  ocean's surface, while its speed as compared to any man-of-war, would  enable it to cover more ground within a given 24 hours.    So on the Navy's recommendation Congress in 1940 approved the building  of the airship fleet up to substantial proportions, together with bases  from which they might operate along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.  That program is now being put into effect and the Goodyear company which  had built most of the airships used in the first World War, began again  to build ships.    The story of the great rigid airships, the Los Angeles, the Akron, Macon  and Graf Zeppelin is fairly well known. That of the smaller non-rigids  is less familiar. The larger airships still hold vital commercial and  military promise for the future. However, this book will confine itself  to the non-rigid airship, with only enough reference to the larger ships  to round out the picture.    Every new vehicle of combat or transport has had to fight its way to  acceptance against misunderstanding and lack of understanding.  Steamships had to prove themselves against sailing ships. Submarines had  an uphill battle to establish themselves. The airplane was long on  probation, and now the airship is on trial.    This book will tell something about these ships, cite what is claimed  for them and what has been reasonably proved they can do, see what  progress has been made in performance, and point out what may be  expected from them hereafter--not avoiding the moot question of  vulnerability.    Lighter-than-air is older by a century than the heavier-than-air branch  of aeronautics. Its history is marked by long research and experiment  and continued progress. Like every pioneering development it has had its  setbacks. But the sincerity of the effort and solid accomplishment made,  entitles the project to thoughtful consideration.

These activities were overshadowed at the time by graver events, or  hidden by military secrecy. Few people even today know that ships were  sunk and men killed by German U-boats within sight of our coast.[1]    It was in no sense an all-out effort. Only a handful of submarines were  used.

Stanley, G.C.B.    Abridged          CHAPTER I.-- INTRODUCTORY. MY INSTRUCTIONS TO FIND AND RELIEVE  LIVINGSTONE.      On the sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand  eight hundred and sixty-nine, I was in Madrid, fresh from the carnage  at Valencia. At 10 A.M. Jacopo, at No.-- Calle de la Cruz, handed me a  telegram: It read, \"Come to Paris on important business.\" The telegram  was from Mr. James Gordon Bennett, jun., the young manager of the 'New  York Herald.'    Down came my pictures from the walls of my apartments on the second  floor; into my trunks went my books and souvenirs, my clothes were  hastily collected, some half washed, some from the clothes-line half  dry, and after a couple of hours of hasty hard work my portmanteaus were  strapped up and labelled \"Paris.\"    At 3 P.M. I was on my way, and being obliged to stop at Bayonne a  few hours, did not arrive at Paris until the following night. I went  straight to the 'Grand Hotel,' and knocked at the door of Mr. Bennett's  room.    \"Come in,\" I heard a voice say. Entering, I found Mr. Bennett in bed.  \"Who are you?\" he asked.    \"My name is Stanley,\" I answered.    \"Ah, yes! sit down; I have important business on hand for you.\"    After throwing over his shoulders his robe-de-chambre Mr. Bennett asked,  \"Where do you think Livingstone is?\"    \"I really do not know, sir.\"    \"Do you think he is alive?\"    \"He may be, and he may not be,\" I answered.    \"Well, I think he is alive, and that he can be found, and I am going to  send you to find him.\"    \"What!\" said I, \"do you really think I can find Dr Livingstone? Do you  mean me to go to Central Africa?\"    \"Yes; I mean that you shall go, and find him wherever you may hear that  he is, and to get what news you can of him, and perhaps\"--delivering  himself thoughtfully and deliberately--\"the old man may be in  want:--take enough with you to help him should he require it. Of  course you will act according to your own plans, and do what you think  best--BUT FIND LIVINGSTONE!\"    Said I, wondering at the cool order of sending one to Central Africa to  search for a man whom I, in common with almost all other men, believed  to be dead, \"Have you considered seriously the great expense you are  likely, to incur on account of this little journey?\"    \"What will it cost?\" he asked abruptly.    \"Burton and Speke's journey to Central Africa cost between L3,000 and  L5,000, and I fear it cannot be done under L2,500.\"    \"Well, I will tell you what you will do. Draw a thousand pounds now; and  when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that  is spent, draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw  another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.\"    Surprised but not confused at the order--for I knew that Mr. Bennett  when once he had made up his mind was not easily drawn aside from his  purpose--I yet thought, seeing it was such a gigantic scheme, that he  had not quite considered in his own mind the pros and cons of the case;  I said, \"I have heard that should your father die you would sell the  'Herald' and retire from business.\"    \"Whoever told you that is wrong, for there is not, money enough in New  York city to buy the 'New York Herald.' My father has made it a  great paper, but I mean to make it greater. I mean that it shall be a  newspaper in the true sense of the word. I mean that it shall publish  whatever news will be interesting to the world at no matter what cost.\"    \"After that,\" said I, \"I have nothing more to say. Do you mean me to go  straight on to Africa to search for Dr. Livingstone?\"    \"No! I wish you to go to the inauguration of the Suez Canal first,  and then proceed up the Nile. I hear Baker is about starting for Upper  Egypt. Find out what you can about his expedition, and as you go up  describe as well as possible whatever is interesting for tourists; and  then write up a guide--a practical one--for Lower Egypt; tell us about  whatever is worth seeing and how to see it.    \"Then you might as well go to Jerusalem; I hear Captain Warren is making  some interesting discoveries there. Then visit Constantinople, and find  out about that trouble between the Khedive and the Sultan.    \"Then--let me see--you might as well visit the Crimea and those old  battle-grounds, Then go across the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea; I hear  there is a Russian expedition bound for Khiva. From thence you may get  through Persia to India; you could write an interesting letter from  Persepolis.    \"Bagdad will be close on your way to India; suppose you go there, and  write up something about the Euphrates Valley Railway. Then, when you  have come to India, you can go after Livingstone. Probably you will hear  by that time that Livingstone is on his way to Zanzibar; but if not,  go into the interior and find him. If alive, get what news of his  discoveries you can; and if you find he is dead, bring all possible  proofs of his being dead. That is all. Good-night, and God be with you.\"    \"Good-night, Sir,\" I said, \"what it is in the power of human nature to  do I will do; and on such an errand as I go upon, God will be with me.\"    I lodged with young Edward King, who is making such a name in New  England. He was just the man who would have delighted to tell the  journal he was engaged upon what young Mr. Bennett was doing, and what  errand I was bound upon.    I should have liked to exchange opinions with him upon the probable  results of my journey, but I dared not do so. Though oppressed with the  great task before me, I had to appear as if only going to be present at  the Suez Canal. Young King followed me to the express train bound  for Marseilles, and at the station we parted: he to go and read the  newspapers at Bowles' Reading-room--I to Central Africa and--who knows?    There is no need to recapitulate what I did before going to Central  Africa.    I went up the Nile and saw Mr. Higginbotham, chief engineer in Baker's  Expedition, at Philae, and was the means of preventing a duel between  him and a mad young Frenchman, who wanted to fight Mr. Higginbotham with  pistols, because that gentleman resented the idea of being taken for an  Egyptian, through wearing a fez cap. I had a talk with Capt. Warren at  Jerusalem, and descended one of the pits with a sergeant of engineers  to see the marks of the Tyrian workmen on the foundation-stones of the  Temple of Solomon. I visited the mosques of Stamboul with the Minister  Resident of the United States, and the American Consul-General. I  travelled over the Crimean battle-grounds with Kinglake's glorious books  for reference in my hand. I dined with the widow of General Liprandi  at Odessa. I saw the Arabian traveller Palgrave at Trebizond, and Baron  Nicolay, the Civil Governor of the Caucasus, at Tiflis. I lived with the  Russian Ambassador while at Teheran, and wherever I went through  Persia I received the most hospitable welcome from the gentlemen of  the Indo-European Telegraph Company; and following the examples of many  illustrious men, I wrote my name upon one of the Persepolitan monuments.  In the month of August, 1870, I arrived in India.    On the 12th of October I sailed on the barque 'Polly' from Bombay  to Mauritius. As the 'Polly' was a slow sailer, the passage lasted  thirty-seven days. On board this barque was a William Lawrence  Farquhar--hailing from Leith, Scotland--in the capacity of first-mate.  He was an excellent navigator, and thinking he might be useful to me,  I employed him; his pay to begin from the date we should leave Zanzibar  for Bagamoyo. As there was no opportunity of getting, to Zanzibar  direct, I took ship to Seychelles. Three or four days after arriving  at Mahe, one of the Seychelles group, I was fortunate enough to get  a passage for myself, William Lawrence Farquhar, and an Arab boy from  Jerusalem, who was to act as interpreter--on board an American whaling  vessel, bound for Zanzibar; at which port we arrived on the 6th of  January, 1871.    I have skimmed over my travels thus far, because these do not concern  the reader. They led over many lands, but this book is only a narrative  of my search after Livingstone, the great African traveller. It is  an Icarian flight of journalism, I confess; some even have called it  Quixotic; but this is a word I can now refute, as will be seen before  the reader arrives at the \"Finis.\"    I have used the word \"soldiers\" in this book. The armed escort a  traveller engages to accompany him into East Africa is composed of free  black men, natives of Zanzibar, or freed slaves from the interior,  who call themselves \"askari,\" an Indian name which, translated, means  \"soldiers.\" They are armed and equipped like soldiers, though they  engage themselves also as servants; but it would be more pretentious in  me to call them servants, than to use the word \"soldiers;\" and as I  have been more in the habit of calling them soldiers than \"my  watuma\"--servants--this habit has proved too much to be overcome. I have  therefore allowed the word \"soldiers\" to appear, accompanied, however,  with this apology.    But it must be remembered that I am writing a narrative of my own  adventures and travels, and that until I meet Livingstone, I presume  the greatest interest is attached to myself, my marches, my troubles,  my thoughts, and my impressions. Yet though I may sometimes write, \"my  expedition,\" or \"my caravan,\" it by no means follows that I arrogate to  myself this right. For it must be distinctly understood that it is the  \"'New York Herald' Expedition,\" and that I am only charged with its  command by Mr. James Gordon Bennett, the proprietor of the 'New York  Herald,' as a salaried employ of that gentleman.    One thing more; I have adopted the narrative form of relating the story  of "]]]
