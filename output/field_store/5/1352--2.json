E.        PREFACE    _The Story of \"Mormonism\"_ as presented in the following pages  is a revised and reconstructed version of lectures delivered by Dr.  James E. Talmage at the University of Michigan, Cornell  University, and elsewhere.  The \"Story\" first appeared in print  as a lecture report in the _Improvement Era_, and was afterward  issued as a booklet from the office of the _Millennial Star_,  Liverpool.  In 1910 it was issued in a revised form by the Bureau  of Information at Salt Lake City, in which edition the lecture  style of direct address was changed to the ordinary form of  essay.  The present or third American edition has been revised  and amplified by the author.    The \"Story\" has been translated and published abroad.  Already  versions have appeared in Swedish, modern Greek, and Russian.    The subject matter of _The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\"_ was first  presented as a lecture delivered by Dr. Talmage before the  Philosophical Society of Denver.  It appeared later in the  columns of the _Improvement Era_, and translations have been  published in pamphlet form in the Danish and German languages.    The present publication of these two productions is made in  response to a steady demand.                                                     THE PUBLISHERS.    Salt Lake City, Utah,  March, 1914.        THE STORY OF \"MORMONISM\"        CHAPTER I    In the minds of many, perhaps of the majority of people, the  scene of the \"Mormon\" drama is laid almost entirely in Utah;  indeed, the terms \"Mormon question\" and \"Utah question\" have been  often used interchangeably.  True it is, that the development of  \"Mormonism\" is closely associated with the history of the  long-time Territory and present State of Utah; but the origin of  the system must be sought in regions far distant from the present  gathering-place of the Latter-day Saints, and at a period  antedating the acquisition of Utah as a part of our national  domain.    The term \"origin\" is here used in its commonest application--that  of the first stages apparent to ordinary observation--the visible  birth of the system.  But a long, long period of preparation had  led to this physical coming forth of the \"Mormon\" religion, a  period marked by a multitude of historical events, some of them  preceding by centuries the earthly beginning of this modern  system of prophetic trust.  The \"Mormon\" people regard the  establishment of their Church as the culmination of a great  series of notable events.  To them it is the result of causes  unnumbered that have operated through ages of human history, and  they see in it the cause of many developments yet to appear.  This to them establishes an intimate relationship between the  events of their own history and the prophecies of ancient times.    In reading the earliest pages of \"Mormon\" history, we are  introduced to a man whose name will ever be prominent in the  story of the Church--the founder of the organization by common  usage of the term, the head of the system as an earthly  establishment--one who is accepted by the Church as an ambassador  specially commissioned of God to be the first revelator of the  latter-day dispensation.  This man is Joseph Smith, commonly  known as the \"Mormon\" prophet.  Rarely indeed does history  present an organization, religious, social, or political, in  which an individual holds as conspicuous and in all ways as  important a place as does this man in the development of  \"Mormonism.\" The earnest investigator, the sincere truth-seeker,  can ignore neither the man nor his work; for the Church under  consideration has risen from the testimony solemnly set forth and  the startling declarations made by this person, who, at the time  of his earliest announcements, was a farmer's boy in the first  half of his teens.  If his claims to ordination under the hands  of divinely commissioned messengers be fallacious, forming as  they form the foundation of the Church organization, the  superstructure cannot stand; if, on the other hand, such  declarations be true, there is little cause to wonder at the  phenomenally rapid rise and the surprising stability of the  edifice so begun.    Joseph Smith was born at Sharon, Vermont, in December, 1805.  He  was the son of industrious parents, who possessed strong  religious tendencies and tolerant natures.  For generations his  ancestors had been laborers, by occupation tillers of the soil;  and though comfortable circumstances had generally been their  lot, reverses and losses in the father's house had brought the  family to poverty; so that from his earliest days the lad Joseph  was made acquainted with the pleasures and pains of hard work.  He is described as having been more than ordinarily studious for  his years; and when that powerful wave of religious agitation and  sectarian revival which characterized the first quarter of the  last century, reached the home of the Smiths, Joseph with others  of the family was profoundly affected.  The household became  somewhat divided on the subject of religion, and some of the  members identified themselves with the more popular sects; but  Joseph, while favorably impressed by the Methodists in comparison  with others, confesses that his mind was sorely troubled over the  contemplation of the strife and tumult existing among the  religious bodies; and he hesitated.  He tried in vain to solve  the mystery presented to him in the warring factions of what  professed to be the Church of Christ.  Surely, thought he, these  several churches, opposed as they are to one another on what  appear to be the vital points of religion, cannot all be right.  While puzzling over this anomaly he chanced upon this verse in  the epistle of St. James:        \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that      giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and      it shall be given him.\"    In common with so many others, the earnest youth found here  within the scriptures, admonition and counsel as directly  applicable to his case and circumstances as if the lines had been  addressed to him by name.  A brief period of hesitation, in which  he shrank from the thought that a mortal like himself, weak,  youthful, and unlearned, should approach the Creator with a  personal request, was followed by a humble and contrite  resolution to act upon the counsel of the ancient apostle.  The  result, to which he bore solemn record (testifying at first with  the simplicity and enthusiasm of youth, afterward confirming the  declaration with manhood's increasing powers, and at last  voluntarily sealing the testimony with his life's blood,) proved  most startling to the sectarian world--a world in which according  to popular belief no new revelation of truth was possible.  It is  a surprising fact that while growth, progress, advancement,  development of known truths and the acquisition of new ones,  characterize every living science, the sectarian world has  declared that nothing new must be expected as direct revelation  from God.    The testimony of this lad is, that in response to his  supplication, drawn forth by the admonition of an inspired  apostle, he received a divine ministration; heavenly beings  manifested themselves to him--two, clothed in purity, and alike  in form and feature.  Pointing to the other, one said, \"This is  my beloved Son, hear Him.\"  In answer to the lad's prayer, the  heavenly personage so designated informed Joseph that the Spirit  of God dwelt not with warring sects, which, while professing a  form of godliness, denied the power thereof, and that he should  join none of them.  Overjoyed at the glorious manifestation thus  granted unto him, the boy prophet could not withhold from  relatives and acquaintances tidings of the heavenly vision.  From  the ministers, who had been so energetic in their efforts to  convert the boy, he received, to his surprise, abuse and  ridicule.  \"Visions and manifestations from God,\" said they, \"are  of the past, and all such things ceased with the apostles of old;  the canon of scripture is full; religion has reached its  perfection in plan, and, unlike all other systems contrived or  accepted by human kind, is incapable of development or growth.  It is true God lives, but He cares not for His children of modern  times as He did for those of ancient days; He has shut Himself  away from the people, closed the windows of heaven, and has  suspended all direct communication with the people of earth.\"    The persecution thus originating with those who called themselves  ministers of the gospel of Christ spread throughout the  community; and the sects that before could not agree together nor  abide in peace, became as one in their efforts to oppose the  youth who thus testified of facts, which though vehemently  denounced, produced an effect that alarmed them the more.  And  such a spectacle has ofttimes presented itself before the  world--men who cannot tolerate one another in peace swear  fidelity and mutual support in strife with a common opponent.  The importance of this alleged revelation from the heavens to the  earth is such as to demand attentive consideration.  If a fact,  it is a full contradiction of the vague theories that had been  increasing and accumulating for centuries, denying personality  and parts to Deity.    In 1820, there lived one person who knew that the word of the  Creator, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness,\"  had a meaning more than in metaphor.  Joseph Smith, the youthful  prophet and revelator of the nineteenth century, knew that the  Eternal Father and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Midway (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team.

It must be very, very full of plums, you know,\" looking up at him  anxiously, \"for Polly dearly loves plums.\"    \"It shall be that plummy,\" said Jefferson convincingly, \"that you'd  think you never saw such a one for richness. Oh, my! what a pie that  shall be!\" exclaimed the cook, shutting up one eye to look through the  other in a spasm of delight at an imaginary pie; \"so it's for Miss  Mary, is it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, \"it is. Oh, Jefferson, I'm so glad you like to  have me make one,\" she clasped her hands in silent rapture, and sat  down on the lowest stair to think it over a bit, Jefferson looking at  her, forgetful that the under cook was fuming in the deserted domains  over his delay to return. At last he said, bowing respectfully, \"If you  please, Miss, it's about time to begin. Such a pie ain't done without a  deal of care, and we'd best have it a-baking as soon as may be.\"    \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, getting off from her stair, and surrendering her  hand to his big black palm, \"we ought to go right this very minute. But  I must get my apron on;\" she stopped and looked down at her red dress.    \"Oh! you can take one of my aprons,\" said the cook, \"they're as fine,  and big, and white, and I'll just put you in one of 'em and tie you up  as snug; you'll come out as clean and sweet when we're through, as you  are now, Miss.\"    \"Tie me up?\" laughed Phronsie in glee. \"Oh! how nice, Jefferson. Do you  know I love you very much, Jefferson, you're so very good to me?\"    The big fellow drew a long breath. \"No, Miss, I'm big and black, and  just fit to stay downstairs,\" he managed to say.    \"But I love you better because you are black, Jefferson,\" insisted  Phronsie, \"a great deal better. You are not like everybody else, but  you are just yourself,\" clinging to his hand.    \"Well, Miss, I ain't just fit for a lily to touch and that's the  truth,\" looking down at his palm that the small white hand grasped  closely. \"It's clean, Miss,\" he added with pardonable pride, \"but it's  awful black.\"    \"I like it better black, Jefferson,\" said Phronsie again, \"really and  truly I do, because then it's your very, very own,\" in a tone that  thrilled him much as if a queen had knighted him on the spot.    This important declaration over, the two set forth on their way toward  the kitchen, Phronsie clinging to his hand, and chatting merrily over  the particular pie in prospect, with varied remarks on pies in general,  that by and by would be ventured upon if this present one were a  success--and very soon tied up in one of the cook's whitest aprons she  was seated with due solemnity at the end of the baking table, the  proper utensils and materials in delightful confusion before her, and  the lower order of kitchen satellites revolving around her, and  Jefferson the lesser sphere.    \"Now all go back to your work,\" said that functionary when he  considered the staring and muttered admiration had been indulged in  long enough, \"and leave us.\"    \"I want you,\" said his assistant, touching his elbow.    \"Clear out,\" said Jefferson angrily, his face turned quite from  Phronsie.    But she caught the tone and immediately laid down the bit of dough she  was moulding.    \"Do go,\" she begged, \"and come back quickly,\" smiling up into his face.  \"See, I'm going to pat and pat and pat, oh! ever so much before you  come back.\"    So Jefferson followed the under cook, the scullery boy went back to  cleaning the knives, Susan, the parlor maid who was going through the  kitchen with her dustpan and broom, hurried off with a backward glance  or two, and Phronsie was left quite alone to hum her way along in her  blissful culinary attempt.    \"Bless me!\" exclaimed a voice close to her small ear, as she was  attempting for the fifth time to roll out the paste quite as thin as  she had seen Jefferson do, \"what is this? Bless my soul! it's Phronsie!\"    Phronsie set down the heavy rolling-pin and turned in her chair with a  gleeful laugh.    \"Dear, dear Grandpapa!\" she cried, clasping her floury hands, \"oh! I'm  so glad you've come to see me make a pie all by myself. It's for Polly,  and it's to be full of plums; Jefferson let me make it.\"    \"Jefferson? And where is he, pray?\" cried Mr. King irately. \"Pretty  fellow, to bring you down to these apartments, and then go off and  forget you. Jefferson!\" he called sharply, \"here, where are you?\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Phronsie in dire distress, \"I sent him;  Jefferson didn't want to go, Grandpapa dear, really and truly, he went  because I asked him.\"    \"If you please, sir,\" began Jefferson, hurrying up, \"I only stepped off  a bit to the cellar. Bassett sent down a lot of turnips, they ain't  first-rate, and\"--    \"All right,\" said Mr. King, cutting him short with a wave of his hand,  \"if Miss Phronsie sent you off, it's all right; I don't want to hear  any more elaborate explanations.\"    \"Little Miss hasn't been alone but a few minutes,\" said Jefferson in a  worried way.    \"And see,\" said Phronsie, turning back to her efforts, while one hand  grasped the old gentleman's palm, \"I've almost got it to look like  Jefferson's. Almost, haven't I?\" she asked, regarding it anxiously.    \"It will be the most beautiful pie,\" cried Mr. King, a hearty  enthusiasm succeeding his irritability, \"that ever was baked. I wish  you'd make me one sometime, Phronsie.\"    \"Do you?\" she cried in a tremor of delight, \"and will you really have  it on the table, and cut it with Aunt Whitney's big silver knife?\"    \"That I will,\" declared Mr. King solemnly.    \"Then some day I'll come down here again, Jefferson,\" cried Phronsie in  a transport, \"and bake one for my dear Grandpapa. That is, if this one  is good. Oh! you do suppose it will be good, don't you?\" appealingly at  him.    \"It shall,\" said Jefferson stoutly, and seizing the rolling-pin with  extreme determination. \"You want a bit more butter worked in, here,\" a  dab with skillful fingers, and a little manipulation with the flour, a  roll now and then most deftly, and the paste was laid out before  Phronsie. \"Now, Miss, you can put it in the dish.\"    \"But is isn't my pie,\" said Phronsie, and, big girl as she felt herself  to be, she sat back in her chair, her lower lip quivering.    \"Not your pie?\" repeated the cook, bringing himself up straight to gaze  at her.    \"No,\" said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head gravely, \"it isn't my pie  now, Jefferson. You put in the things, and rolled it.\"    \"Leave your fingers off from it, can't you?\" cried Mr. King sharply.  \"Goodness! this pie isn't to have a professional touch about it. Get  some more flour and stuff, whatever it is you make a pie of, and let  her begin again. There, I'll sit down and watch you; then there'll be  some chance of having things straight.\" So he drew up a chair to the  side of the table, first calling off Pete, the scullery boy, from his  knives to come and wipe it off for him, and Mrs. Tucker who was in  kitchen dialect \"Tucker,\" to see that the boy did his work well.    \"Lor' bless you, sir,\" said Tucker, bestowing a final polish with her  apron, \"'twas like satin before, sir--not a wisp of dust.\"    \"I don't want any observations from you,\" said the old gentleman,  depositing himself in the chair. \"There, you can go back to your work,  Mrs. Tucker, and you too, Pete. Now I'll see that this pie is to your  liking, Phronsie.\"    But Phronsie still sat back in her chair, thoughtfully surveying  Jefferson.    \"Grandpapa,\" she said at last slowly, \"I think I'd rather have the  first pie, I really would, Grandpapa, may I?\" She brought her yellow  head forward by a sudden movement, and looked deep into his keen eyes.    \"Bless my soul! Rather have the first pie?\" repeated the old gentleman  in astonishment, \"why, I thought you wanted to make one all yourself.\"    \"I think I'd rather do part of it,\" said Phronsie with great  deliberateness, \"then Polly'll like it, and eat it, and I'll do yours,  Grandpapa dear, just as Jefferson fixed mine, all alone. Please let  me.\" She held him fast with her eyes, and waited for his answer.    \"So you shall!\" cried Mr. King in great satisfaction, \"make mine all  alone. This one would better go as it is. Put away the flour and  things, Jefferson; Miss Phronsie doesn't want them.\"    Phronsie gave a relieved little sigh. \"And, Jefferson, if you hadn't  showed me how, I couldn't ever in all this world make Grandpapa's. Now  give me the little plate, do.\"    \"Here 'tis, Miss,\" said the cook, all his tremor over the blunder he  had made, disappearing, since, after all, things were quite  satisfactory. And the little plate forthcoming, Phronsie tucked away  the paste lovingly in its depths, and began the important work of"]]]
