We shall venture to  propose, that pain and pleasure are not only not necessarily dependent  for their existence on their mutual diminution or removal, but that, in  reality, the diminution or ceasing of pleasure does not operate like  positive pain; and that the removal or diminution of pain, in its  effect, has very little resemblance to positive pleasure.[10] The former  of these propositions will, I believe, be much more readily allowed than  the latter; because it is very evident that pleasure, when it has run  its career, sets us down very nearly where it found us. Pleasure of  every kind quickly satisfies; and, when it is over, we relapse into  indifference, or, rather, we fall into a soft tranquillity which is  tinged with the agreeable color of the former sensation. I own it is not  at first view so apparent that the removal of a great pain does not  resemble positive pleasure: but let us recollect in what state we have  found our minds upon escaping some imminent danger, or on being released  from the severity of some cruel pain. We have on such occasions found,  if I am not much mistaken, the temper of our minds in a tenor very  remote from that which attends the presence of positive pleasure; we  have found them in a state of much sobriety, impressed with a sense of  awe, in a sort of tranquillity shadowed with horror. The fashion of the  countenance and the gesture of the body on such occasions is so  correspondent to this state of mind, that any person, a stranger to the  cause of the appearance, would rather judge us under some consternation,  than in the enjoyment of anything like positive pleasure.        [Greek:      Hos d' hotan andr' ate pykine labe, host' eni patre,      Phota katakteinas, allon exiketo demon,      Andros es aphneiou, thambos d' echei eisoroontas.]                                            Iliad, [Greek: O]. 480.       \"As when a wretch, who, conscious of his crime,      Pursued for murder from his native clime,      Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed;      All gaze, all wonder!\"    This striking appearance of the man whom Homer supposes to have just  escaped an imminent danger, the sort of mixed passion of terror and  surprise, with which he affects the spectators, paints very strongly the  manner in which we find ourselves affected upon occasions any way  similar. For when we have suffered from any violent emotion, the mind  naturally continues in something like the same condition, after the  cause which first produced it has ceased to operate. The tossing of the  sea remains after the storm; and when this remain of horror has entirely  subsided, all the passion which the accident raised subsides along with  it; and the mind returns to its usual state of indifference. In short,  pleasure (I mean anything either in the inward sensation, or in the  outward appearance, like pleasure from a positive cause) has never, I  imagine, its origin from the removal of pain or danger.      SECTION IV.    OF DELIGHT AND PLEASURE, AS OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER.    But shall we therefore say, that the removal of pain or its diminution  is always simply painful? or affirm that the cessation or the lessening  of pleasure is always attended itself with a pleasure? By no means. What  I advance is no more than this; first, that there are pleasures and  pains of a positive and independent nature; and, secondly, that the  feeling which results from the ceasing or diminution of pain does not  bear a sufficient resemblance to positive pleasure, to have it  considered as of the same nature, or to entitle it to be known by the  same name; and thirdly, that upon the same principle the removal or  qualification of pleasure has no resemblance to positive pain. It is  certain that the former feeling (the removal or moderation of pain) has  something in it far from distressing, or disagreeable in its nature.  This feeling, in many cases so agreeable, but in all so different from  positive pleasure, has no name which I know; but that hinders not its  being a very real one, and very different from all others. It is most  certain, that every species of satisfaction or pleasure, how different  soever in its manner of affecting, is of a positive nature in the mind  of him who feels it. The affection is undoubtedly positive; but the  cause may be, as in this case it certainly is, a sort of _privation_.  And it is very reasonable that we should distinguish by some term two  things so distinct in nature, as a pleasure that is such simply, and  without any relation, from that pleasure which cannot exist without a  relation, and that, too, a relation to pain. Very extraordinary it would  be, if these affections, so distinguishable in their causes, so  different in their effects, should be confounded with each other,  because vulgar use has ranged them under the same general title.  Whenever I have occasion to speak of this species of relative pleasure,  I call it _delight_; and I shall take the best care I can to use that  word in no other sense. I am satisfied the word is not commonly used in  this appropriated signification; but I thought it better to take up a  word already known, and to limit its signification, than to introduce a  new one, which would not perhaps incorporate so well with the language.  I should never have presumed the least alteration in our words, if the  nature of the language, framed for the purposes of business rather than  those of philosophy, and the nature of my subject, that leads me out of  the common track of discourse, did not in a manner necessitate me to it.  I shall make use of this liberty with all possible caution. As I make  use of the word _delight_ to express the sensation which accompanies the  removal of pain or danger, so, when I speak of positive pleasure, I  shall for the most part call it simply _pleasure_.      SECTION V.    JOY AND GRIEF.    It must be observed, that the cessation of pleasure affects the mind  three ways. If it simply ceases after having continued a proper time,  the effect is _indifference_; if it be abruptly broken off, there ensues  an uneasy sense called _disappointment_; if the object be so totally  lost that there is no chance of enjoying it again, a passion arises in  the mind which is called _grief_. Now there is none of these, not even  grief, which is the most violent, that I think has any resemblance to  positive pain. The person who grieves suffers his passion to grow upon  him; he indulges it, he loves it: but this never happens in the case of  actual pain, which no man ever willingly endured for any considerable  time. That grief should be willingly endured, though far from a simply  pleasing sensation, is not so difficult to be understood. It is the  nature of grief to keep its object perpetually in its eye, to present it  in its most pleasurable views, to repeat all the circumstances that  attend it, even to the last minuteness; to go back to every particular  enjoyment, to dwell upon each, and to find a thousand new perfections in  all, that were not sufficiently understood before; in grief, the  _pleasure_ is still uppermost; and the affliction we suffer has no  resemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we  endeavor to shake off as soon as possible. The Odyssey of Homer, which  abounds with so many natural and affecting images, has none more  striking than those which Menelaus raises of the calamitous fate of his  friends, and his own manner of feeling it. He owns, indeed, that he  often gives himself some intermission from such melancholy reflections;  but he observes, too, that, melancholy as they are, they give him  pleasure.        [Greek:      All empes pantas men odyromenos kai acheuon,      Pollakis en megaroisi kathemenos hemeteroisin,      Allote men te goo phrena terpomai, allote d' aute      Pauomai; aipseros de koros kryeroio gooio]                                            Hom. Od. [Greek: D]. 100       \"Still in short intervals of _pleasing woe_,      Regardful of the friendly dues I owe,      I to the glorious dead, forever dear,      _Indulge_ the tribute of a _grateful_ tear.\"    On the other hand, when we recover our health, when we escape an  imminent danger, is it with joy that we are affected? The sense on these  occasions is far from that smooth and voluptuous satisfaction which the  assured prospect of pleasure bestows. The delight which arises from the  modifications of pain confesses the stock from whence it sprung, in its  solid, strong, and severe nature.      SECTION VI.    OF THE PASSIONS WHICH BELONG TO SELF-PRESERVATION.    Most of the ideas which are capable of making a powerful impression on  the mind, whether simply of pain or pleasure, or of the modifications of  those, may be reduced very nearly to these two heads,  _self-preservation_, and _society_; to the ends of one or the other of  which all our passions are calculated to answer. The passions which  concern self-preservation, turn mostly on _pain_ or _danger_. The ideas  of _pain_, _sickness_, and _death_, fill the mind with strong emotions  of horror; but _life_ and _health_, though they put us in a capacity of  being affected with pleasure, make no such impression by the simple  enjoyment. The passions therefore which are conversant about the  preservation of the individual turn chiefly on _pain_ and _danger_, and  they are the most powerful of all the passions.      SECTION VII.    OF THE SUBLIME.    Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain and danger,  that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about  terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a  source of the _sublime_; that is, it is productive of the strongest  emotion which the mind is capable of feeling. I say the strongest  emotion, because I am satisfied the ideas of pain are much more powerful  than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#20)"],[1,"d, from the time of embarkation to the present date  81    Convicts unfit for labour, from old age, infirmities, etc.    52    JOHN WHITE, Surgeon.  Sydney Cove, Port Jackson.      Chapter XIII.    June 1788 to July 1788    Particular description of Sydney Cove--Of the buildings actually  erected--and of the intended town--A settlement made at the head of the  harbour.    There are few things more pleasing than the contemplation of order and  useful arrangement, arising gradually out of tumult and confusion; and  perhaps this satisfaction cannot any where be more fully enjoyed than  where a settlement of civilized people is fixing itself upon a newly  discovered or savage coast. The wild appearance of land entirely  untouched by cultivation, the close and perplexed growing of trees,  interrupted now and then by barren spots, bare rocks, or spaces overgrown  with weeds, flowers, flowering shrubs, or underwood, scattered and  intermingled in the most promiscuous manner, are the first objects that  present themselves; afterwards, the irregular placing of the first tents  which are pitched, or huts which are erected for immediate accommodation,  wherever chance presents a spot tolerably free from obstacles, or more  easily cleared than the rest, with the bustle of various hands busily  employed in a number of the most incongruous works, increases rather than  diminishes the disorder, and produces a confusion of effect, which for a  time appears inextricable, and seems to threaten an endless continuance  of perplexity. But by degrees large spaces are opened, plans are formed,  lines marked, and a prospect at least of future regularity is clearly  discerned, and is made the more striking by the recollection of the  former confusion.    To this latter state the settlement at Sydney Cove had now at length  arrived, and is so represented in the plan annexed. Lines are there  traced out which distinguish the principal street of an intended town, to  be terminated by the Governor's house, the main guard, and the criminal  court. In some parts of this space temporary barracks at present stand,  but no permanent buildings will be suffered to be placed, except in  conformity to the plan laid down. Should the town be still further  extended in future, the form of other streets is also traced in such a  manner as to ensure a free circulation of air. The principal streets,  according to this design, will be two hundred feet wide; the ground  proposed for them to the southward is nearly level, and is altogether an  excellent situation for buildings. It is proposed by Governor Phillip  that when houses are to be built here, the grants of land shall be made  with such clauses as will prevent the building of more than one house on  one allotment, which is to consist of sixty feet in front, and one  hundred and fifty feet in depth. These regulations will preserve a kind  of uniformity in the buildings, prevent narrow streets, and exclude many  inconveniences which a rapid increase of inhabitants might otherwise  occasion hereafter. It has been also an object of the Governor's  attention to place the public buildings in situations that will be  eligible at all times, and particularly to give the storehouses and  hospital sufficient space for future enlargement, should it be found  necessary.    The first huts that were erected here were composed of very perishable  materials, the soft wood of the cabbage palm, being only designed to  afford immediate shelter. The necessity of using the wood quite green  made it also the less likely to prove durable. The huts of the convicts  were still more slight, being composed only of upright posts, wattled  with slight twigs, and plaistered up with clay. Barracks and huts were  afterwards formed of materials rather more lasting. Buildings of stone  might easily have been raised, had there been any means of procuring lime  for mortar. The stone which has been found is of three sorts: A fine free  stone, reckoned equal in goodness to that of Portland; an indifferent  kind of sand stone, or firestone; and a sort which appears to contain a  mixture of iron. But neither chalk, nor any species of lime-stone has yet  been discovered. In building a small house for the Governor on the  eastern side of the Cove, (marked 1 in the plan) lime was made of oyster  shells, collected in the neighbouring coves; but it cannot be expected  that lime should be supplied in this manner for many buildings, or indeed  for any of great extent. Till this difficulty shall be removed by the  discovery of chalk or lime-stone, the public buildings must go on very  slowly, unless care be taken to send out those articles as ballast in all  the ships destined for Port Jackson. In the mean time the materials can  only be laid in clay, which makes it necessary to give great thickness to  the walls, and even then they are not so firm as might be wished. Good  clay for bricks is found near Sydney Cove, and very good bricks have been  made. The wood, from the specimens that have been received in England,  appears to be good; it is heavy indeed, but fine grained, and apparently  strong, and free from knots. The imperfections that were found in it at  first arose probably from the want of previous seasoning.    The hospital is placed on the west side of the Cove, in a very healthful  situation, entirely clear of the town; and is built in such a manner as  to last for some years. On the high ground between the hospital and the  town, if water can be found by sinking wells, it is the Governor's  intention to erect the barracks, surrounding them with proper works.  These were to have been begun as soon as the transports were cleared, and  the men hutted, but the progress of work was rendered so slow by the want  of an adequate number of able workmen, that it was necessary to postpone  that undertaking for a time. The ground marked out for a church lies  still nearer to the town, so that this edifice will form in part one side  of the principal parade. The design which demanded the most immediate  execution was that of a storehouse, which might be secure from the danger  of fire. In a country exposed to frequent storms of thunder and  lightning, it was rather an uneasy situation to have all the provisions  and other necessaries lodged in wooden buildings, covered with thatch of  the most combustible kind. On the point of land that forms the west side  of the Cove, and on an elevated spot, a small observatory has been raised  under the direction of Lieutenant Dawes, who was charged by the Board of  Longitude with the care of observing the expected comet. The longitude of  this observatory is ascertained to be 159 deg. 19' 30\" east from Greenwich,  and the latitude 32 deg. 52' 30\" south. A small house, built by the  Lieutenant Governor for himself, forms at present the corner of the  parade; the principal street will be carried on at right angles with the  front of this building. Instead of thatch, they now use shingles made  from a tree in appearance like a fir, but producing a wood not unlike the  English oak. This, though more secure than thatching, is not enough so  for storehouses. For these, if slate-stone should not be found, tiles  must be made of the clay which has been used for bricks. The principal  farm is situated in the next cove to the east of the town, and less than  half a mile from it. When the plan was drawn it contained about nine  acres laid down in corn of different kinds. Later accounts speak of six  acres of wheat, eight of barley, and six of other grain, as raised on the  public account, and in a very promising way.    Sydney cove lies open to the north-east, and is continued in a south-west  direction for near a thousand yards, gradually decreasing from the  breadth of about one thousand four hundred feet, till it terminates in a  point, where it receives a small stream of fresh water. The anchorage  extends about two thousand feet up the cove, and has soundings in general  of four fathoms near the shore, and five, six, or seven, nearer the  middle of the channel. It is perfectly secure in all winds; and for a  considerable way up on both sides, ships can lie almost close to the  shore: nor are there, in any part of it, rocks or shallows to render the  navigation dangerous. Such a situation could not fail to appear  desireable to a discerning man, whose object it was to establish a  settlement, which he knew must for some time depend for support on the  importation of the principal necessaries of life.    It is supposed that metals of various kinds abound in the soil on which  the town is placed. A convict, who had formerly been used to work in the  Staffordshire lead mines, declared very positively, that the ground which  they were now clearing, contains a large quantity of that ore: and copper  is supposed to lie under some rocks which were blown up in sinking a  cellar for the public stock of spirituous liquors. It is the opinion of  the Governor himself that several metals are actually contained in the  earth hereabouts, and that mines may hereafter be worked to great  advantage: but at present he strongly discourages any search of this  kind, very judiciously discerning, that in the present situation of his  people, which requires so many exertions of a very different nature, the  discovering of a mine would be the greatest evil that could befal the  settlement. In some places where they dug, in making wells, they found a  substance which at first was taken for a metal, but which proving  perfectly refractory in a very strong and long continued heat, has since  been concluded to be black lead. The kind of pigment called by painters  Spanish brown, is found in great abundance, and the white clay with which  the natives paint themselves is still in greater plenty. The Abbe le  Receveur was of opinion, that this clay, if cleared from the sand, which  might easily be separated, would make excellent porcelain."]]]
