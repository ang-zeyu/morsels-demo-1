Another night when the Kluxers were riding, the  slaves recognised the voice of their young master. That was the reason  why the Keephart slaves were never molested.    Christmas was a jolly time for the Keephart slaves. They would have a  whole week to celebrate, eating, dancing, and making merry.    \"Free born niggers\" were not allowed to associate with the slaves, as  they were supposed to have no sense, and would contaminate the slaves.      Interviewer's Comment    Mrs. Locke is an intelligent old lady, has been a good dressmaker, and  served for a great number of the \"first families\" of Indianapolis.    She has been married twice; her first husband died shortly after their  marriage, and she was a widow for twenty-five years before she took her  second \"venture.\"    She gets the old age pension and is very happy.

His master was a very cruel man, but was always kind to him, because he  had given him (Bob) as a present to his favorite daughter, Jane Alice,  and she would never permit anyone to mistreat Bob.    Miss Jane Alice was very fond of little Bob, and taught him to read and  write.    His master owned a large farm, but Jane Alice would not let little Bob  work on the farm. Instead, he helped his master in the blacksmith shop.    His master always prepared himself to whip his slaves by drinking a  large glass of whiskey to give him strength to beat his slaves.    Robert remembers seeing his master beat his mother until she would fall  to the ground, and he was helpless to protect her. He would just have to  stand and watch.    He has seen slaves tied to trees and beaten until the master could beat  no longer; then he would salt and pepper their backs.    Once when the Confederate soldiers came to their farm, Robert told them  where the liquor was kept and where the stock had been hidden. For this  the soldiers gave him a handful of money, but it did him no good for his  master took it away from him.    The McKinley family, of course, were Parkers and after the Civil war,  they took the name of their father who was a slave of John McKinley.    A neighbor farmer, Jesse Hayden, was very kind to his slaves, gave them  anything they wanted to eat, because he said they had worked hard, and  made it possible for him to have all he had, and it was part theirs.      The Parker slaves were not allowed to associate with the Hayden slaves.  They were known as the \"rich niggers, who could eat meat without  stealing it.\"    When the \"nigger traders\" came to the Parker farm, the old mistress  would take meat skins and grease the mouths of the slave children to  make it appear she had given them meat to eat.      Interviewer's Comment    Mr. McKinley is an \"herb doctor\" and lives very poorly in a dirty little  house; he was very glad to tell of his early life.    He thinks people live too fast these days, and don't remember there is a  stopping place.    Submitted January 10, 1938  Indianapolis, Indiana          Federal Writers' Project  of the W.P.A.  District #6  Marion County  Anna Pritchett  1200 Kentucky Avenue    FOLKLORE  RICHARD MILLER--AN OLD SOLDIER  1109 North West Street      Richard Miller was born January 12, 1843 in Danville, Kentucky. His  mother was an English subject, born in Bombay, India and was brought  into America by a group of people who did not want to be under the  English government. They landed in Canada, came on to Detroit, stayed  there a short time, then went to Danville, Kentucky. There she married a  slave named Miller. They were the parents of five children.    After slavery was abolished, they bought a little farm a few miles from  Danville, Kentucky.    The mother was very ambitious for her children, and sent them to the  country school.    One day, when the children came home from school, their mother was gone;  they knew not where.    It was learned, she was sending her children to school, and that was not  wanted. She was taken to Texas, and nothing, was heard from her until  1871.    She wrote her brother she was comming to see them, and try to find her  children, if any of them were left.    The boy, Richard, was in the army. He was so anxious to see his mother,  to see what she would look like. The last time he saw her, she was  washing clothes at the branch, and was wearing a blue cotton dress. All  he could remember about her was her beautiful black hair, and the cotton  dress. When he saw her, he didnot recognize her, but she told him of  things he could remember that had happened, and that made him think she  was his mother.    Richard was told who had taken the mother from the children, went to the  man, shot and killed him; nothing was done to him for his deed.    He remembers a slave by the name of Brown, in Texas, who was chained  hand and feet to a woodpile, oil thrown over him, and the wood, then  fire set to the wood, and he was burned to death.    After the fire smoldered down, the white women and children took his  ashes for souvenirs.    When slavery was abolished, a group of them started down to the far  south, to buy farms, to try for themselves, got as far as Madison  County, Kentucky and were told if they went any farther south, they  would be made slaves again, not knowing if that was the truth or not,  they stayed there, and worked on the Madison County farms for a very  small wage. This separated families, and they never heard from each  other ever again.    These separations are the cause of so many of the slave race not being  able to trace families back for generations, as do the white families.    George Band was a very powerful slave, always ready to fight, never  losing a fight, always able to defend himself until one night a band of  Ku Kluxers came to his house, took his wife, hung her to a tree, hacked  her to death with knives. Then went to the house, got George, took him  to see what they had done to his wife. He asked them to let him go back  to the house to get something to wrap his wife in, thinking he was  sincere in his request, they allowed him to go. Instead of getting a  wrapping for his wife, he got his Winchester rifle, shot and killed  fourteen of the Kluxers. The county was never bothered with the Klan  again. However, George left immediately for the North.    The first Monday of the month was sale day. The slaves were chained  together and sent down in Miss., often separating mothers from children,  husbands from wives, never to hear of each other again.      Interviewer's Comment    Mr. Miller lives with his family in a very comfortable home.    He has only one eye, wears a patch over the bad one.    He does not like to talk of his early life as he said it was such a  \"nightmare\" to him; however he answered all questions very pleasantly.    Submitted December 9, 1937  Indianapolis, Indiana          William R. Mays  District 4  Johnson County    HENRY CLAY MOORMAN  BORN IN SLAVERY IN KENTUCKY  427 W. King St., Franklin, Ind.      Henry Clay Moorman has resided in Franklin 34 years, he was born Oct. 1,  1854 in slavery on the Moorman plantation in Breckenridge County,  Kentucky.    Mr. Moorman relates his own personal experiences as well as those handed  down from his mother. He was a boy about 12 years old when freedom was  declared. His father's name was Dorah Moorman who was a cooper by trade,  and had a wife and seven children. They belonged to James Moorman, who  owned about 20 slaves, he was kind to his slaves and never whipped any  of them. These slaves loved their master and was as loyal to him as his  own family.    Mr. Moorman says that when a boy he did small jobs around the plantation  such as tobacco planting and going to the mill. One day he was placed  upon a horse with a sack of grain containing about two bushels, after  the sack of grain was balanced upon the back of the horse he was started  to the mill which was a distance of about five miles, when about half  the distance of the journey the sack of grain became unbalanced and fell  from the horse being too small to lift the sack of grain he could only  cry over the misfortune. There he was, powerless to do any thing about  it. After about two hours there was a white man riding by and seeing the  predicament he was in kindly lifted the sack up on the horse and after  ascertaining his master's name bade him to continue to the mill. It was  the custom at the mill that each await their turn, and do their own  grinding. After the miller had taken his toll, he returned to his master  and told of his experience. Thereafter precautions were taken so he  would not again have the same experience.    The slave owners had so poisoned the minds of the slaves, they were in  constant fear of the soldiers. One day when the slaves were alone at the  plantation they sighted the Union soldiers approaching, they all went  to the woods and hid in the bushes. The smaller children were covered  with leaves. There they remained all night, as the soldiers (about 200  in number) camped all night in the horse lot. These soldiers were very  orderly; however, they appropriated for their own use all the food they  could find.    The slave owners would hide all their silverware and other articles of  worth under the mattresses that were in the negro cabins for safe  keeping.    There were three white children in the master's family.

Beaumarchais, comme un joueur  excite par l'abstinence, tentera de nouveau avec fureur les chances et  la folie des intrigues. Scott, plus insouciant peut-etre, et comme un  voyageur simplement curieux qui a deja vu beaucoup de siecles et de  pays, mais qui n'est pas las encore, se remettra en marche au risque  de repasser, chemin faisant, par les memes aventures. Moliere, penseur  profond, triste au dedans, ayant hate de sortir de lui-meme et  d'echapper a ses peines secretes, sera cette fois d'un comique plus  grave ou plus fou qu'a l'ordinaire. Shakspeare redoublera de grace, de  fantaisie ou d'effroi. Le grand Corneille enfin (car il est de cette  famille), Corneille couvert de cicatrices, epuise, mais infatigable et  sans relache comme ses heros, pareil a ce valeureux comte de Fuentes  dont parle Bossuet, et qui combattit a Rocroi jusqu'au dernier soupir,  Corneille ramenera obstinement au combat ses vieilles bandes espagnoles  et ses drapeaux dechires.    Voila les poetes dramatiques. Dirai-je que Racine ne leur ressembla  jamais dans sa retraite; qu'il ne vit plus rien de ce qu'il avait  quitte; qu'il n'eut point, a ses heures de reverie, des apparitions  charmantes qui remuaient, comme autrefois, son coeur? Ce serait faire  injure a son genie. Mais ces creations memes vers lesquelles un doux  penchant dut le rentrainer d'abord, ces Monime, ces Phedre, ces Berenice  au long voile, ces nobles amantes solitaires qu'il revoyait, a la nuit  tombante, sous les traits de la Champmesle, et qui s'enfuyaient,  comme Didon, dans les bocages, qu'etaient-elles, je le demande? Ou  voulaient-elles le ramener? Differaient-elles beaucoup de l'_Elegie a la  voix gemissante_;      Au ris mele de pleurs, aux longs cheveux epars,    Belle, levant au ciel ses humides regards?    Et quand il se fut tout a fait refugie dans l'amour divin, ces formes  attrayantes d'un amour profane continuerent-elles longtemps a repasser  dans ses songes? Pour moi, je ne le crois point. Il fut prompt a les  dissiper et a les oublier: ses affections bientot allerent toutes  ailleurs; il ne pensait qu'a Port-Royal, alors persecute, et se  complaisait delicieusement dans ses souvenirs d'enfance: \"En effet,  dit-il, il n'y avoit point de maison religieuse qui fut en meilleure  odeur que Port-Royal. Tout ce qu'on en voyoit au dehors inspiroit de la  piete; on admiroit la maniere grave et touchante dont les louanges de  Dieu y etoient chantees, la simplicite et en meme temps la proprete de  leur eglise, la modestie des domestiques, la solitude des parloirs, le  peu d'empressement des religieuses a y soutenir la conversation, leur  peu de curiosite pour savoir les choses du monde et meme les affaires de  leurs proches; en un mot, une entiere indifference pour tout ce qui  ne regardoit point Dieu. Mais combien les personnes qui connoissoient  l'interieur de ce monastere y trouvoient-elles de nouveaux sujets  d'edification! Quelle paix! quel silence! quelle charite! quel amour  pour la pauvrete et pour la mortification! Un travail sans relache, une  priere continuelle, point d'ambition que pour les emplois les plus  vils et les plus humiliants, aucune impatience dans les soeurs,  nulle bizarrerie dans les meres, l'obeissance toujours prompte et le  commandement toujours raisonnable.\" Et vers le meme temps il ecrivait a  son fils: \"M. de Rost m'a appris que la Champmesle etoit a l'extremite,  de quoi il me paroit tres-afflige; mais ce qui est le plus affligeant,  c'est de quoi il ne se soucie guere apparemment, je veux dire  l'obstination avec laquelle cette pauvre malheureuse refuse de renoncer  a la comedie, ayant declare, a ce qu'on m'a dit, qu'elle trouvoit  tres-glorieux pour elle de mourir comedienne. Il faut esperer que, quand  elle verra la mort de plus pres, elle changera de langage comme font  d'ordinaire la plupart de ces gens qui font tant les fiers quand ils  se portent bien. Ce fut madame de Caylus qui m'apprit hier cette  particularite dont elle etoit effrayee, et qu'elle a sue, comme je  crois, de M. le cure de Saint-Sulpice.\" Et dans une autre lettre: \"Le  pauvre M. Boyer est mort fort chretiennement; sur quoi je vous dirai,  en passant, que je dois reparation a la memoire de la Champmesle, qui  mourut avec d'assez bons sentiments, apres avoir renonce a la comedie,  tres-repentante de sa vie passee, mais surtout fort affligee de  mourir: du moins M. Despreaux me l'a dit ainsi, l'ayant appris du cure  d'Auteuil, qui l'assista a la mort; car elle est morte a Auteuil, dans  la maison d'un maitre a danser, ou elle etoit venue prendre l'air.\" On a  besoin de croire, pour excuser ce ton de secheresse, que Racine voulait  faire indirectement la lecon a son fils, et condamner ses propres  erreurs dans la personne de celle qui en avait ete l'objet. Mais, meme  en tenant compte de l'intention, on peut conclure hardiment, apres avoir  lu et compare ces passages, que les sentiments du poete ne prenaient  plus la forme dramatique, et que la figure de la Champmesle lui etait  depuis longtemps sortie de la memoire. Port-Royal avait toute son ame;  il y puisait le calme, il y rapportait ses prieres; il etait plein des  gemissements de cette maison affligee, quand il fit entendre, pour  l'heureuse maison de Saint-Cyr, la melodie touchante des choeurs  d'_Esther_[26]. En un mot, c'etait la disposition lyrique qui  prevalait evidemment dans le poete, et qui le plus souvent, au defaut  d'epanchement convenable, debordait dans ces larmes dont nous avons  parle. Un de nos amis les plus chers, qui, pour etre romantique, a  ce qu'on dit, n'en garde pas moins a Racine un respect profond et un  sincere amour, a essaye de retracer l'etat interieur de cette belle ame  dans une piece de vers qu'il ne nous est pas permis de louer, mais que  nous inserons ici comme achevant de mettre en lumiere notre point de vue  critique.    [Note 26: Racine se trouvait precisement dans l'eglise du monastere  des Champs, quand l'archeveque Harlay de Champvallon y vint, le 17 mai  1679, a neuf heures du matin, pour renouveler la persecution qui avait  ete interrompue durant dix annees, mais qui, a partir de ce jour-la,  ne cessa plus jusqu'a l'entiere ruine. Il causa quelque temps avec le  prelat qui, l'ayant apercu, l'avait fait appeler par politesse. Plus  tard, surtout quand sa tante fut abbesse, il devint a Versailles le  charge d'affaires en titre des pauvres persecutees. Toutes les demandes  d'adoucissement pres de l'archeveque, les suppliques pour obtenir tel ou  tel confesseur, roulaient sur lui. Il usait son temps et son credit a  ces demarches, avec un zele ou il entrait quelque pensee d'expiation.]      LES LARMES DE RACINE.    Racine, qui veut pleurer, viendra a la profession de la soeur Lalie.    (MADAME DE MAINTENON.)      Jean Racine, le grand poete,    Le poete aimant et pieux,    Apres que sa lyre muette    Se fut voilee a tous les yeux,    Renoncant a la gloire humaine,    S'il sentait en son ame pleine    Le flot contenu murmurer,    Ne savait que fondre en priere,    Pencher l'urne dans la poussiere    Aux pieds du Seigneur, et pleurer.      Comme un coeur pur de jeune fille    Qui coule et deborde en secret,    A chaque peine de famille,    Au moindre bonheur, il pleurait;    A voir pleurer sa fille ainee;    A voir sa table couronnee    D'enfants, et lui-meme au declin;    A sentir les inquietudes    De pere, tout causant d'etudes,    Les soirs d'hiver, avec Rollin;      Ou si dans la sainte patrie,    Berceau de ses reves touchants,    Il s'egarait par la prairie    Au fond de Port-Royal-des-Champs;    S'il revoyait du cloitre austere    Les longs murs, l'etang solitaire,    Il pleurait comme un exile;    Pour lui, pleurer avait des charmes.    Le jour que mourait dans les larmes    Ou La Fontaine ou Champmesle[27].      Surtout ces pleurs avec delices    En ruisseaux d'amour s'ecoulaient,    Chaque fois que sous des cilices    Des fronts de seize ans se voilaient;    Chaque fois que des jeunes filles,    Le jour de leurs voeux, sous les grilles    S'en allaient aux yeux des parents,    Et foulant leurs bouquets de fete,    Livrant les cheveux de leur tete,    Epanchaient leur ame a torrents.      Lui-meme il dut payer sa dette;    Au temple il porta son agneau;    Dieu marquant sa fille cadette,    La dota du mystique anneau.    Au pied de l'autel avancee,    La douce et blanche fiancee    Attendait le divin Epoux;    Mais, sans voir la ceremonie,    Parmi l'encens et l'harmonie    Sanglotait le pere a genoux[28].    [Note 27: Il est permis de supposer, malgre ce qu'on a vu plus haut,  que le poete donna secretement a la Champmesle quelques larmes et  quelques prieres.]    [Note 28: Lope de Vega eut aussi une fille, et la plus cherie, qui se  fit religieuse; il composa sur cette prise de voile une piece de vers  fort touchante, ou il decrit avec beaucoup d'exaltation les alternatives  de ses emotions de pere et de ses joies comme chretien (Fauriel; _Vie de  Lope de Vega_). Mais Racine ne put que pleurer.]      Sanglots, soupirs, pleurs de tendresse,    Pareils a ceux qu'en sa ferveur    Madeleine la pecheresse    Repandit aux pieds du Sauveur;    Pareils aux flots de parfum rare    Qu'en pleurant la soeur de Lazare    De ses longs cheveux essuya;    Pleurs abondants comme les votres,    O le plus tendre des apotres,    Avant le jour d'Alleluia!      Priere confuse et muette,    Effusion de saints desirs,    Quel luth se fera l'interprete    De ces sanglots, de ces soupirs?    Qui demelera le mystere    De ce coeur qui ne peut se taire,    Et qui pourtant n'a point de voix?    Qui dira le sens des murmures    Qu'eveille a travers les ramures    Le vent d'automne dans les bois?      C'etait une offrande avec plainte,    Comme Abraham en sut offrir;    C'etait une derniere etreinte    Pour l'enfant qu'on a vu nourrir;    C'etait un retour sur lui-meme,    Pecheur releve d'anatheme,    Et sur les "]]]
