The  mother was not made a minor's guardian. No longer was the estate  protected by the minor's kin as his birthright. A female heir was  expected to marry a man acceptable to the lord. The estate of an  heiress and her land was generally sold to the highest bidder. If  there were no heirs, the land escheated to the lord. If a tenant  committed felony, his land escheated to his lord. The word  \"felony\" came from the Latin word meaning \"to deceive\" and  referred to the feudal crime of betraying or committing treachery  against one's lord.    Astrologers resided with the families of the barons. People went  to fortune tellers' shops. There was horse racing, steeple races,  and chess for recreation. Girls had dolls; boys had toy soldiers,  spinning tops, toy horses, ships, and wooden models.    The state of medicine is indicated by this medical advice brought  to the nation by William's son after treatment on the continent:    \"If thou would have health and vigor Shun cares and avoid anger.  Be temperate in eating And in the use of wine. After a heavy meal  Rise and take the air Sleep not with an overloaded stomach And  above all thou must Respond to Nature when she calls.\"    The Conquerer allowed Jewish traders to follow him from Normandy  and settle in separate sections of the main towns. Then engaged in  long distance trade, money changing, and money lending. They  loaned money for interest for the building of castles and  cathedrals. Christians were not allowed by the church to engage in  this usury. The Jews could not become citizens nor could they have  standing in the local courts. Instead, a royal justiciar secured  justice for them. They could practice their own religion.    William the Conquerer was succeeded as king by his son William II  (Rufus), who transgressed many of the customs of the nation to get  more money for himself. He was killed by an arrow of a fellow  hunter while they and William's younger brother Henry were hunting  together in a crown forest. Henry then became king.                                      - The Law -    The Norman conquerors brought no written law, but affirmed the  laws of the nation. Two they especially enforced were:    Anyone caught in the act of digging up the King's road, felling a  tree across it, or attacking someone so that his blood spilled on  it shall pay a fine to the King.    All freemen shall have a surety who would hand him over to justice  for his offenses or pay the damages or fines due. If an accused  man fled, his surety would have a year to find him to obtain  reimbursement.    The Conquerer proclaimed that:    No cattle shall be sold except in towns and before three  witnesses.    For the sale of ancient chattels, there must be a surety and a  warrantor.    No man shall be sold over the sea. (This ended the slave trade at  the port of Bristol.)    The death penalty for persons tried by court is abolished.                                 - Judicial Procedure -    \"Ecclesiastical\" courts were created for bishops to preside over  cases concerning the cure of souls and criminal cases, in which  the ordeal was used. When the Conquerer did not preside over this  court, an appeal could be made to him.    The hundred and county courts now sat without clergy and handled  only \"civil\" cases. They were conducted by the King's own  appointed sheriff. Only freemen and not bound villeins had  standing in this court. They continued to transact their business  in the English language.    The local jurisdictions of thegns who had grants of sac and soke  or who exercised judicial functions among their free neighbors  were now called \"manors\" under their new owners, who conducted a  manor court.    The Conquerer's Royal Court was called the \"Curia Regis\". When the  Conquerer wished to determine the national laws, he summoned  twelve elected representatives of each county to declare on oath  the ancient lawful customs and law as they existed in the time of  the popular King Edward the Confessor. The recording of this law  was begun. A person could spend months trying to catch up with the  Royal Court to present a case. Sometimes the Conquerer sent the  justiciar or commissioners to hold his Royal Court in the various  districts. The commissioner appointed groups of local men to give  a collective verdict upon oath for each trial he conducted. The  Conquerer allowed, on an ad hoc basis, certain high-level people  such as bishops and abbots and those who made a large payment, to  have land disputes decided by an inquiry of recognitors. Besides  royal issues, the Curia Regis heard appeals from lower court  decisions. It used English, Norman, feudal, Roman, and canon law  legal principles to reach a decision, and was flexible and  expeditious.    A dispute between a Norman and an English man over land or a  criminal act could be decided by trial by combat [battle]. Each  combatant first swore to the truth of his cause and undertook to  prove by his body the truth of his cause by making the other  surrender by crying \"craven\" [craving forgiveness]. The combatants  used weapons like pickaxes and shields. Presumably the man in the  wrong would not fight as well because he was burdened with a  guilty conscience. Although this trial was thought to reflect  God's will, it favored the physically fit and adept person. After  losing the trial by combat, the guilty person would be punished  appropriately.    London had its own traditions. All London citizens met at its  folkmote, which was held three times a year to determine its  public officers, to raise matters of public concern, and to make  ordinances. Its criminal court had the power of outlawry as did  the county courts. Trade, land, and other civil issues were dealt  with by the Hustings Court, which met every Monday in the  Guildhall. The city was divided into wards, each of which was  under the charge of an elected alderman [elder man]. (The election  was by a small governing body and the most wealthy and reputable  men and not a popular election.) The aldermen had special  knowledge of the law and a duty to declare it at the Hustings  Court. Each alderman also conducted wardmotes in his ward and  decided criminal and civil issues between its residents. Within  the wards were the guilds of the city.    The Normans, as foreigners, were protected by the king's peace.  The entire hundred was the ultimate surety for murder and would  have to pay a \"murdrum\" fine of 31 pounds [46 marks] for the  murder of any Norman, if the murderer was not apprehended by his  lord within a few days. The reaction to this was that the murderer  mutilated the corpse to make identification of ethnicity  impossible. So the Conquerer ordered that every murder victim was  assumed to be Norman unless proven English. This began a court  custom in murder cases of first proving the victim to be English.    The Royal Court decided this case: \"At length both parties were  summoned before the King's court, in which there sat many of the  nobles of the land of whom Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, was  delegated by the King's authority as judge of the dispute, with  Ranulf the Vicomte, Neel, son of Neel, Robert de Usepont, and many  other capable judges who diligently and fully examined the origin  of the dispute, and delivered judgment that the mill ought to  belong to St. Michael and his monks forever. The most victorious  King William approved and confirmed this decision.\"                                         - - - Chapter 5 - - -                                - The Times: 1100-1154 -    King Henry I, son of William the Conquerer, furthered peace  between the Normans and native English by his marriage to a niece  of King Edward the Confessor called Matilda. She married him on  condition that he grant a charter of rights undoing some practices  of the past reigns of William I and William II. Peace was also  furthered by the fact that Henry I had been born in England and  English was his native tongue. The private wars of lords were now  replaced by less serious mock battles.    Henry was a shrewd judge of character and of the course of events,  cautious before taking action, but decisive in carrying out his  plans. He was faithful and generous to his friends. He showed a strong  practical element of calculation and foresight. Although illiterate, he  was intelligent and a good administrator. He had an efficient  intelligence gathering network and an uncanny knack of detecting hidden  plans before they became conspiratorial action.  He made many able men  of inferior social position nobles, thus creating a class of career  judges and administrators in opposition to the extant hereditary  aristocracy. He loved books and built a palace at Oxford to which he  invited scholars for lively discussion. Euclid's \"Elements\" \", which  deduced from axioms the properties of lines, circles, and spheres, was  introduced into England.    Queen Matilda served as regent of the kingdom in Henry's absence,  as William's queen had for him. Both queens received special  coronation apart from their husbands; they held considerable  estates which they administered through their own officers, and  were frequently composed of escheated honors. Matilda was learned  and a literary patron. She founded an important literary and  scholastic center. Her compassion was great and her charities  extensive. In London she founded several almshouses and a  caregiving infirmary for lepers. These were next to small monastic  communities. She also had new roads and bridges built.    Henry issued charters restoring customs which had been  subordinated to royal impositions by previous Kings, which set a  precedent for later Kings. His coronation charter describes  certain property rights he restored after the oppressive reign of  his brother.    \"Henry, King of the English, to Samson the bishop, and Urse of  Abbetot, and to all his barons"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#20)"],[1,"them is to be  found the essence of the highest Yogi teachings. While we have  endeavored to present these high truths to you in the simplest possible  form, yet unless your minds have been trained to grasp the thought, you  may have trouble in fully assimilating the essence of the teachings.  But, be not discouraged, for your mind will gradually unfold like the  flower, and the Sun of Truth will reach into its inmost recesses. Do  not be troubled if your comprehension seems dull, or your progress  slow, for all things will come to you in time. You cannot escape the  Truth, nor can the Truth escape you. And it will not come to you one  moment sooner than you are ready to receive it, nor will it be delayed  one moment in its coming, when you are ready for it. Such is the Law,  and none can escape it, nor alter it, nor modify it. All is Well, and  All is Under the Law--nothing ever \"happens.\"    To many, the thought that the Universe and all that is therein  contained, are simply \"Thought Forms\" in the Infinite Mind--Mental  Creations of the Absolute, may seem startling, and a sense of unreality  may pervade one. This is inevitable, but the reaction will come. To  some who have grasped this mighty truth there has come a feeling that  \"All is Nothing,\" which idea is embodied in their teachings and  writings. But this is merely the Negative Phase of the Truth--there is  a Positive Phase which comes as one advances.    The Negative Phase shows us that all that we have considered as real  and permanent--the foundations of the Universe itself--is but a mental  image in the mind of the Absolute, and therefore lacks the fundamental  reality that we had previously associated with it. And realizing this,  we are at first apt to feel that, indeed \"all is nothing,\" and to fall  into a state of apathy, and lack of desire to play our part in the  world. But, then, happily the reaction sets in, sooner or later, and we  begin to see the Positive Phase of the Truth. This Positive Phase shows  us that while all the forms, shapes, and phenomena of the Universe are  but parts of a great show-world, still the _essence of_ all must be  Reality, itself, else there would not be even the \"appearance\" of a  Universe. Before a thing can be a Mental Image, there must be a Mind to  hold that Mental Image, and a BEING to possess that Mind. And, the very  essence of that BEING must pervade and be immanent in every Image in  that Mind. Just as _You_ are really in your Mental Images, as well as  they in You, so must the Absolute be _in_ Its Mental Images, or  Creations, or Thought Forms, as truly as they are in the Mind of the  Absolute. Do you see this plainly? Think well over it--ponder it  well--for in it lies the Truth.    And so, this Positive Phase of the Truth, is far from depressing--it is  the most stimulating conception one can hold, if he but grasps it in  its entirety and fulness.  Even if it be true that all these shapes,  and forms, and appearances, and phenomena, and personalities, be but  illusion as compared to the inner Reality--what of it? Are you not then  assured that the Spirit within Yourself is the Spirit of the  Absolute--that the Reality within You is the Reality of the  Absolute--that you ARE, because the Absolute IS, and cannot be  otherwise? Does not the Peace, and Calm, and Security, and Bliss that  comes to you with this Realization, far more than counterbalance the  petty nothings that you have discarded? We think that there can be but  one answer to this, when you have fully Realized the Truth.    What gives you the greatest Satisfaction and Content in Life? Let us  see. Well, there is the Satisfaction of Immortality. The human mind  instinctively craves this. Well, what that even the highest finite  conceptions of Future Life have given you, can compare with the  assurance of Actual Being, in and of the Absolute? What are your petty  conceptions of \"heavens,\" \"paradises,\" \"happy-hunting-grounds,\" \"divine  regions of the blessed,\" and the other ideas of the various religious  sects, when compared with the conceptions of your Infinite and Eternal  Existence in Spirit--your relation with The One--that conception of  Infinite Wisdom, Being, and Bliss? When you grasp this truth, you will  see that you are \"in Eternity right Now,\" and are Immortal even this  moment, as you have always been.    Now, what we have said above is not intended to deny the  \"heaven-worlds,\" or planes. On the contrary, you will find much in the  teachings regarding these, which the Yogis enter into with much detail.  But, we mean that back of all the \"heavens\" and \"celestial planes,\"  there is a still higher state of being being--the \"Absolute Being.\"  Even the \"heavens,\" and \"heaven-worlds,\" and regions of the _Devas_, or  Archangels, are but relative states--there is a state higher than even  these exalted relative states, and that is the State of the Conscious  Unity and Identity with the One. When one enters into that State, he  becomes more than Man--more than gods--he is then \"in the bosom of the  Father.\"    And now, before proceeding to a consideration of the phenomenal  manifestation of the Absolute--the evolving of the Universe in the  Infinite Mind--we will again call your attention to the fact that  underlies all the Universe of forms, shapes and appearances, and that  is, as we stated in our last lesson:    _All Manifestations and Emanations of the Absolute are Mental Creations  of the Absolute--Thought-Forms held in the Infinite Mind--the Infinite  Spirit in them--and they in the Infinite Spirit. And, the only Real  Thing about Man is the Spirit involved in the Thought-Form--the rest is  mere Personality, which changes and ceases to be. The Spirit in the  Soul of Man, is the Soul of the Soul, which is never born; never  changeth; never dieth--this is The Real Self of Man, in which, indeed,  he is \"One with the Father_.\"    And, now let us consider the Yogi Teachings regarding the creation of  the Universe, and the evolution of the living forms thereon. We shall  endeavor to give you the story as plainly as may be, holding fast to  the main thought, and avoiding the side-paths of details, etc., so far  as is possible.    In the first place, we must imagine ourselves back to the beginning of  a \"Day of Brahm,\"--the first dawn of that Day, which is breaking from  the darkness of a \"Night of Brahm.\" Before we proceed further, we must  tell you something about these \"Days and Nights of Brahm,\" of which you  have seen much mention in the Oriental writings.    The Yogi Teachings contain much regarding the \"Days and Nights of  Brahm;\" the \"In-breathing and Out-breathing of the Creative Principle;\"  the periods of \"_Manvantara_,\" and the periods of \"_Pralaya_.\" This  thought runs through all the Oriental thought, although in different  forms, and with various interpretations. The thought refers to the  occult truth that there is in Cosmic Nature alternate periods of  Activity and Inactivity--Days and Nights--In-breathings and  Out-breathings--Wakefulness and Sleep. This fundamental law manifests  in all Nature, from Universes to Atoms. Let us see it now in its  application to Universes.    At this point we would call the attention of the student that in many  of the presentations of the Hindu Teachings the writers speak as if the  Absolute, _Itself_, were subject to this law of Rhythm, and had Its  Periods of Rest and Work, like Its manifestations. This is incorrect.  The highest teachings do not so hold, although at first glance it would  so appear. The teaching really is that while the Creative Principle  manifests this rhythm, still even this principle, great though it be,  is a manifestation of the Absolute, and not the Absolute itself. The  highest Hindu teachings are firm and unmistakable about this point.    And, another point, in which there is much mistaken teaching. In the  periods of Creative Inactivity in a Universe it must not be supposed  that there is no Activity anywhere. On the contrary, there is never a  cessation of Activity on the part of the Absolute. While it is Creative  Night in one Universe, or System of Universes, there is intense  activity of Mid-Day in others. When we say \"The Universe\" we mean the  Universe of Solar Systems--millions of such systems--that compose the  particular universe of which we have any knowledge. The highest  teachings tell us that this Universe is but one of a System of  Universes, millions in number--and that this System is but one, in a  higher System, and so on and on, to infinity. As one Hindu Sage hath  said: \"Well do we know that the Absolute is constantly creating  Universes in Its Infinite Mind--and constantly destroying them--and,  though millions upon millions of aeons intervene between creation and  destruction, yet doth it seem less than the twinkle of an eye to The  Absolute One.\"    And so the \"Day and Night of Brahm\" means only the statement of the  alternating periods of Activity and Inactivity in some one particular  Universe, amidst the Infinite Universality. You will find a mention of  these periods of Activity and Inactivity in the \"_Bhagavad Gita_,\" the  great Hindu epic. The following quotations, and page references, relate  to the edition published by the Yogi Publication Society, which was  compiled and adapted by the writer of these lessons. In that edition of  the \"_Bhagavad Gita_,\" on page 77, you will find these words attributed  to _Krishna_, the Absolute One in human incarnation:    \"The worlds and universes--yea, even the world of Brahm, a single day  of which is like unto a thousand _Yugas_ (four billion years of the  earth), and his night as much--these worlds must come and go... The  Days of Brahm are succeeded by the Nights of Brahm. In these Brahmic  Days all things emerge from invisibility, and become visible. And, on  the coming of the Brahmic Night, all visible things again melt into  invisibility. The Universe having once existed,"]]]
