The party  have always praised each other most highly--have invariably opposed all  improvements in the Society, all change in the mode of management;  and have maintained, that all those who wished for any alteration were  factious; and, when they discovered any symptoms of independence and  inquiry breaking out in any member of the Council, they have displaced  him as soon as they decently could.    Of the arguments employed by those who support the SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT  by which the Royal Society is governed, I shall give a few samples:  refutation is rendered quite unnecessary--juxta-position is  alone requisite. If any member, seeing an improper appointment in  contemplation, or any abuse in the management of the affairs of the  Society continued, raise a voice against it, the ready answer is, Why  should you interfere? it may not be quite the thing you approve; but it  is no affair of yours.--If, on the other hand, it do relate to himself,  the reply is equally ready. It is immediately urged: The question is  of a personal nature; you are the last person who ought to bring it  forward; you are yourself interested. If any member of the Society,  feeling annoyed at the neglect, or hurt by the injuries or insults of  the Council, show signs of remonstrance, it is immediately suggested to  him that he is irritated, and ought to wait until his feelings subside,  and he can judge more coolly on the subject; whilst with becoming  candour they admit the ill-treatment, but urge forbearance. If, after  an interval, when reflection has had ample time to operate, the offence  seems great as at first, or the insult appears unmitigated by any  circumstances on which memory can dwell,--if it is then brought forward,  the immediate answer is, The affair is out of date--the thing is gone  by--it is too late to call in question a transaction so long past. Thus,  if a man is interested personally, he is unfit to question an abuse;  if he is not, is it probable that he will question it? and if,  notwithstanding this, he do so, then he is to be accounted a meddler. If  he is insulted, and complain, he is told to wait until he is cool;  and when that period arrives, he is then told he is too late. If his  remonstrance relates to the alteration of laws which are never referred  to, or only known by their repeated breach, he is told that any  alteration is useless; it is perfectly well known that they are never  adhered to. If it relate to the impolicy of any regulations attaching to  an office, he is immediately answered, that that is a personal question,  in which it is impossible to interfere--the officer, it seems, is  considered to have not merely a vested right to the continuance of every  abuse, but an interest in transmitting it unimpaired to his successors.    In the same spirit I have heard errors of calculation or observation  defended. If small errors occur, it is said that they are too trifling  to be of any importance. If larger errors are pointed out, it is  immediately contended that they can deceive nobody, because of their  magnitude. Perhaps it might be of some use, if the Council would oblige  the world with their SCALE of ERROR, with illustrations from some of the  most RECENT and APPROVED works, and would favour the uninformed with  the orthodox creed upon all grades, from that which baffles the human  faculties to detect, up to that which becomes innocuous from its size.    The offices connected with the Royal Society are few in number, and  their emolument small in amount; but the proper disposition of them  is, nevertheless, of great importance to the Society, and was so to the  science of England.    In the first place, the President, having in effect the absolute  nomination of the whole Council, could each year introduce a few  gentlemen, whose only qualification to sit on it would be the high  opinion they must necessarily entertain of the penetration of him who  could discover their scientific merits. He might also place in the list  a few nobles or officials, just to gild it. Neither of these classes  would put any troublesome questions, and one of them might be employed,  from its station in society, to check any that might be proposed by  others.    With these ingredients, added to the regular train of the party, and a  star or two of science to shed lustre over the whole, a very manageable  Council might be formed; and such has been its frequent composition.    The duties of the Secretaries, when well executed, are laborious,  although not in this respect equal to those of the same officers who, in  several societies, give their gratuitous aid; and their labours are much  lightened by the Assistant Secretary and his clerk. The following are  their salaries:--         The Senior Secretary ........... 105L.       The Junior Secretary, 105L........ )       5L. for making Index to Phil. Trans... ) 110L.       The Foreign Secretary...........  20L.    Now it is not customary to change these annually; and as these offices  are amongst the \"loaves and fishes\" they are generally given by the  President to some staunch supporters of the system. They have frequently  been bestowed, with very little consideration for the interest, or even  for the dignity of the Society. To notice only one instance: the late  Sir Joseph Banks appointed a gentleman who remained for years in  that situation, although he was confessedly ignorant of every subject  connected with the pursuits of the Society. I will, however, do justice  to his memory, by saying that his respectability was preserved  under such circumstances, by the most candid admission of the fact,  accompanied by a store of other knowledge unfortunately quite foreign to  the pursuits of the Society; and I will add, that I regretted to see him  insulted by one President in a situation improperly given to him by a  former.    Next in order come the Vice-Presidents, who are appointed by the  President; and in this respect the present practice is not inconvenient.    The case, however, is widely different with the office of Treasurer. The  President ought not to usurp the power of his appointment, which ought,  after serious discussion by the Council, to be made by the Society at  large.    Besides the three Secretaries, there is an Assistant Secretary,  and recently another has been added, who may perhaps be called a  Sub-assistant Secretary. All these places furnish patronage to the  President.    Let us now look at the occasional patronage of the President, arising  from offices not belonging to the Society. He is, EX OFFICIO, a Trustee  of the British Museum; and it may seem harsh to maintain that he is not  a fit person to hold such a situation. It is no theoretical view, but it  is the EXPERIENCE of the past which justifies the assertion; and I  fear that unless he has the sole responsibility for some specific  appointments, and unless his judgment is sharpened by the fear of public  discussion, a President of the Royal Society, in the Board-room of the  British Museum, is quite as likely as another person to sacrifice his  public duty to the influence of power, or to private friendship. With  respect to the merits of that Institution, I have no inclination at  present to inquire: but when it is considered that there is at this  moment attached to it no one whose observations or whose writings have  placed him even in the second rank amongst the naturalists of Europe,  the President of the Royal Society has given some grounds for the remark  made by several members of the Society, that he is a little too much  surrounded by the officers of a body who may reasonably be supposed to  entertain towards him feelings either of gratitude or expectation.  [It will be remembered that the name of Mr. Robert Brown has been but  recently attached to the British Museum, and that it is to be attributed  to his possessing a life interest in the valuable collection of the late  Sir Joseph Banks.]    The late Board of Longitude was another source of patronage, which,  although now abolished, it may be useful to hint at.    There were three members to be appointed by the Royal Society: these  were honorary, and, as no salary was attached, it might have been  expected that this limited number of appointments would have been given  in all cases to persons qualified for them. But no: it was convenient  to pay compliments; and Lord Colchester, whose talents and knowledge  insured him respect as Speaker of the House of Commons, or as a  British nobleman, was placed for years in the situation as one of the  Commissioners of the Board of Longitude, for which every competent judge  knew him to be wholly unfit. What was the return which he made for this  indulgence? Little informed respecting the feelings of the Society, and  probably misinformed by the party whose influence had placed him there,  he saved them in the day of their peril.    When the state of the Society had reached such a point that many of  the more scientific members felt that some amendment was absolutely  necessary to its respectability, a committee was formed to suggest to  the Council such improvements as they might consider it expedient to  discuss. [Amongst the names of the persons composing this Committee,  which was proposed by Mr. South, were those of Dr. Wollaston and  Mr. Herschel.] The Council received their report at the close of the  session; and in recording it on the journals, they made an appeal to the  Council for the ensuing year to bestow on it \"THEIR EARLIEST AND MOST  SERIOUS ATTENTION.\"    Now when the party, to whose government some of these improvements would  have been a death-warrant, found that the subject was likely to be taken  up in the Council, they were in dismay: but the learned and grateful  peer came to their assistance, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12169"],[0,"Sakoontala; Or, The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama (#20)"],[1,"MAIDEN.    Provided you let me have half the reward which the god will  bestow in return.    SECOND MAIDEN.    To be sure you shall, and that without asking. Are we not one in  heart and soul, though divided in body?    [_Leans on her friend and plucks a mango-blossom_.]    Ah! here is a bud just bursting into flower. It diffuses a  delicious perfume, though not yet quite expanded.    [_Joining her hands reverentially_.]      God of the bow, who with spring's choicest flowers    Dost point thy five unerring shafts[91]; to thee    I dedicate this blossom; let it serve    To barb thy truest arrow; be its mark    Some youthful heart that pines to be beloved.                                      [_Throws down a mango-blossom_.    CHAMBERLAIN.                            [_Entering in a hurried manner, angrily_.    Hold there, thoughtless woman. What are you about, breaking off  those mango-blossoms, when the King has forbidden the celebration  of the spring festival?    BOTH MAIDENS.                                         [_Alarmed_.    Pardon us, kind Sir, we have heard nothing of it.    CHAMBERLAIN.    You have heard nothing of it? Why, all the vernal plants and  shrubs, and the very birds that lodge in their branches, show  more respect to the King's order than you do.      Yon mango-blossoms, though long since expanded,    Gather no down upon their tender crests;    The flower still lingers in the amaranth[92],    Imprisoned in its bud; the tuneful Koil,    Though winter's chilly dews be overpast,    Suspends the liquid volume of his song    Scarce uttered in his throat; e'en Love, dismayed,    Restores the half-drawn arrow to his quiver.    BOTH MAIDENS.    The mighty power of King Dushyanta is not to be disputed.    FIRST MAIDEN.    It is but a few days since Mitravasu, the King's brother-in-law,  sent us to wait upon his Majesty; and, during the whole of our  sojourn here, we have been entrusted with the charge of the royal  pleasure-grounds. We are therefore strangers in this place, and  heard nothing of the order till you informed us of it.    CHAMBERLAIN.    Well then, now you know it, take care you don't continue your  preparations.    BOTH MAIDENS.    But tell us, kind Sir, why has the King prohibited the usual  festivities? We are curious to hear, if we may.    SANUMATI.                                              [_Aside_.    Men are naturally fond of festive entertainments. There must be  some good reason for the prohibition.    CHAMBERLAIN.    The whole affair is now public; why should I not speak of it?  Has not the gossip about the King's rejection of [S']akoontala  reached your ears yet?    BOTH MAIDENS.    Oh yes, we heard the story from the King's brother-in-law, as  far, at least, as the discovery of the ring.    CHAMBERLAIN.    Then there is little more to tell you. As soon as the King's  memory was restored by the sight of his own ring, he exclaimed:  'Yes, it is all true. I remember now my secret marriage with  [S']akoontala. When I repudiated her, I had lost my recollection!'  Ever since that moment, he has yielded himself a prey to the  bitterest remorse.      He loathes his former pleasures; he rejects    The daily homage of his ministers;    On his lone couch he tosses to and fro,    Courting repose in vain. Whene'er he meets    The ladies of his palace, and would fain    Address them with politeness, he confounds    Their names; or, calling them '[S']akoontala,'    Is straightway silent and abashed with shame.    SANUMATI.                                               [_Aside_.    To me this account is delightful.    CHAMBERLAIN.    In short, the King is so completely out of his mind that the  festival has been prohibited.    BOTH MAIDENS.    Perfectly right.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    The King! the King! This way, Sire, this way.    CHAMBERLAIN.                                        [_Listening_.    Oh! here comes his Majesty in this direction. Pass on, maidens;  attend to your duties.    BOTH MAIDENS.    We will, sir.                                                           [_Exeunt_.    _Enter King_ DUSHYANTA, _dressed in deep mourning, attended his  Jester_, MA[T.]HAVYA, _and preceded by_ VETRAVATI.    CHAMBERLAIN.                               [_Gazing at the_ KING.    Well, noble forms are certainly pleasing, under all varieties of  outward circumstances. The King's person is as charming as ever,  notwithstanding his sorrow of mind.      Though but a single golden bracelet spans    His wasted arm; though costly ornaments    Have given place to penitential weeds;    Though oft-repeated sighs have blanched his lips,    And robbed them of their bloom; though sleepless care    And carking thought have dimmed his beaming eye;    Yet does his form, by its inherent lustre,    Dazzle the gaze; and, like a priceless gem    Committed to some cunning polisher,    Grow more effulgent by the loss of substance.    SANUMATI.                          [_Aside. Looking at the_ KING.    Now that I have seen him, I can well understand why [S']akoontala  should pine after such a man, in spite of his disdainful  rejection of her.    KING.              [_Walking slowly up and down in deep thought_.      When fatal lethargy o'erwhelmed my soul,    My loved one strove to rouse me, but in vain;    And now, when I would fain in slumber deep    Forget myself, full soon remorse doth wake me.    SANUMATI.                                               [_Aside_.    My poor [S']akoontala's sufferings are very similar.    MA[T.]HAVYA.                                              [_Aside_.    He is taken with another attack of this odious [S']akoontala-fever.  How shall we ever cure him?    CHAMBERLAIN.                                      [_Approaching_.    Victory to the King! Great Prince, the royal pleasure-grounds  have been put in order. Your Majesty can resort to them for  exercise and amusement whenever you think proper.    KING.    Vetravati, tell the worthy Pi[S']una, my prime minister, from me,  that I am so exhausted by want of sleep that I cannot sit on the  judgment-seat to-day. If any case of importance be brought before  the tribunal, he must give it his best attention, and inform me  of the circumstances by letter.    VETRAVATI.    Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.                                                             [_Exit_.    KING.                                      [_To the CHAMBERLAIN_.    And you, Vatayana, may go about your own affairs.    CHAMBERLAIN.    I will, Sire.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Now that you have rid yourself of these troublesome fellows, you  can enjoy the delightful coolness of your pleasure-grounds  without interruption.    KING.    Ah! my dear friend, there is an old adage:--'When affliction has  a mind to enter, she will find a crevice somewhere;' and it is  verified in me.      Scarce is my soul delivered from the cloud    That darkened its remembrance of the past,    When lo! the heart-born deity of love    With yonder blossom of the mango barbs    His keenest shaft, and aims it at my breast.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Well, then, wait a moment; I will soon demolish Master Kama's[47]  arrow with a cut of my cane.               [_Raises his stick and strikes off the mango-blossom_.    KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.    That will do. I see very well the god of love is not a match for  a Brahman. And now, my dear friend, where shall I sit down, that  I may enchant my sight by gazing on the twining plants, which  seem to remind me of the graceful shape of my beloved?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Don't you remember? you told your personal attendant, Chaturika,  that you would pass the heat of the day in the jasmine-bower; and  commanded her to bring the likeness of your queen [S']akoontala,  sketched with your own hand.    KING.    True. The sight of her picture will refresh my soul. Lead the way  to the arbour.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    This way, Sire.                               [_Both move on, followed by_ SANUMATI.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Here we are at the jasmine-bower. Look, it has a marble seat, and  seems to bid us welcome with its offerings of delicious flowers.  You have only to enter and sit down.                                   [_Both enter and seat themselves_.    SANUMATI    [_Aside_.    I will lean against these young jasmines. I can easily, from  behind them, glance at my friend's picture, and will then hasten  to inform her of her husband's ardent affection.                              [_Stands leaning against the creepers_.    KING.    Oh! my dear friend, how vividly all the circumstances of my union  with [S']akoontala present themselves to my recollection at this  moment! But tell me now how it was that, between the time of my  leaving her in the hermitage and my subsequent rejection of her,  you never breathed her name to me? True, you were not by my side  when I disowned her; but I had confided to you the story of my  love, and you were acquainted with every particular. Did it pass  out of your mind as it did out of mine?    MA[T.]HAVYA.    No, no; trust me for that. But, if you remember, when you had  finished telling me about it, you added that I was not to take  the story in earnest, for that you were not really in love with a  country girl, but were only jesting; and I was dull and  thick-headed enough to believe you. But so fate decreed, and  there is no help for it.    SANUMATI.                                               [_Aside_.    Exactly.    KING.                                      [_After deep thought_.    My dear friend, suggest some relief for my misery.    MA[T.]HAVYA.    Come, come, cheer up; why do you give way? Such weakness is  unworthy of you. Great men never surrender themselves to  uncontrolled grief. Do not mountains remain unshaken even in a  gale of wind?    KING.    How can I be otherwise than inconsolable, when I call to mind the  agonized demeanour of the dear one on the occasion"]]]
