So on they went till they came in the neighborhood of the palace. There  they met the king's smith; he was on his way to the smithy, and had a  large pair of tongs in his hand. This smith was a merry fellow, and was  always full of mad pranks and tricks, and when he saw this procession  coming jumping and limping along, he began laughing till he was bent in  two, but suddenly he said:    \"This must be a new flock of geese for the princess: but who can tell  which is goose and which is gander? I suppose it must be the gander  toddling on in front. Goosey, goosey!\" he called, and pretended to be  strewing corn out of his hands as when feeding geese.    But they did not stop. The woman and the man only looked in great rage  at the smith for making game of them. So said the smith: \"It would be  great fun to see if I could stop the whole flock, many as they are!\"--He  was a strong man, and seized the old man with his tongs from behind in  his trousers, and the man shouted and struggled hard, but Hans said:    \"If you'll come along, then hang on!\"    And so the smith had to hang on too. He bent his back and stuck his  heels in the ground when they went up a hill and tried to get away, but  it was of no use; he stuck on to the other as if he had been screwed  fast in the great vise in the smithy, and whether he liked it or not, he  had to dance along with the others.    When they came near the palace, the farm-dog ran against them and barked  at them, as if they were a gang of tramps, and when the princess came to  look out of her window to see what was the matter, and saw this  procession, she burst out laughing. But Hans was not satisfied with  that. \"Just wait a bit, and she will laugh still louder very soon,\" he  said, and made a tour round the palace with his followers.    When they came past the kitchen, the door was open and the cook was just  boiling porridge, but when she saw Hans and his train after him, she  rushed out of the door with the porridge-stick in one hand and a big  ladle full of boiling porridge in the other, and she laughed till her  sides shook; but when she saw the smith there as well, she thought she  would have burst with laughter. When she had had a regular good laugh,  she looked at the golden goose again and thought it was so lovely that  she must stroke it.    \"Hans, Hans!\" she cried, and ran after him with the ladle in her hand;  \"just let me stroke that lovely bird of yours.\"    \"Rather let her stroke me!\" said the smith.    \"Very well,\" said Hans.    But when the cook heard this, she got very angry. \"What is it you say!\"  she cried, and gave the smith a smack with the ladle.    \"If you'll come along, then hang on!\" said Hans, and so she stuck fast  to the others too, and for all her scolding and all her tearing and  pulling, she had to limp along with them.    And when they came past the princess's window again, she was still there  waiting for them, but when she saw that they had got hold of the cook  too, with the ladle and porridge-stick, she laughed till the king had to  hold her up. So Hans got the princess and half the kingdom, and they had  a wedding which was heard of far and wide.          XIX    THE STORY OF TOM TIT TOT[8]      Well, once upon a time there were a woman, and she baked five pies. And  when they come out of the oven, they was that overbaked the crust were  too hard to eat. So she says to her darter:    \"Darter,\" says she, \"put you them there pies on the shelf an' leave 'em  there a little, an' they'll come agin--\" She meant, you know, the crust  'ud get soft.    But the gal, she says to herself, \"Well, if they'll come agin, I'll ate  'em now.\" And she set to work and ate 'em all, first and last.    Well, come supper time, the woman she said, \"Goo you and git one o' them  there pies; I daresay they've come agin, now.\"    The gal, she went an' she looked, and there warn't nothin' but the  dishes. So back she come and says she, \"Noo, they ain't come agin.\"    \"Not none on 'em?\" says the mother.    \"Not none on 'em,\" says she.    \"Well, come agin, or not come agin,\" says the woman, \"I'll ha' one for  supper.\"    \"But you can't, if they ain't come,\" says the gal.    \"But I can,\" says she. \"Goo you and bring the best of 'em.\"    \"Best or worst,\" says the gal, \"I've ate 'em all, and you can't ha' one  till that's come agin.\"    Well, the woman she were wholly bate, and she took her spinnin' to the  door to spin, and as she span she sang:        \"My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day--       My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.\"    The king, he were a comin' down the street and he hard her sing, but  what she sang he couldn't hare, so he stopped and said:    \"What were that you was a singin of, woman?\"    The woman, she were ashamed to let him hare what her darter had been  a-doin', so she sang, 'stids o' that:        \"My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day--       My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.\"    \"S'ars o' mine!\" said the king, \"I never heerd tell of any one as could  do that.\"    Then he said: \"Look you here, I want a wife, and I'll marry your darter.  But look you here,\" says he, \"'leven months out o' the year she shall  have all the vittles she likes to eat, and all the gownds she likes to  git, and all the cumpny she likes to hev; but the last month o' the year  she'll ha' to spin five skeins iv'ry day, an' if she doon't, I shall  kill her.\"    \"All right,\" says the woman; for she thowt what a grand marriage that  was. And as for them five skeins, when te come tew, there'd be plenty o'  ways of gettin' out of it, and likeliest, he'd ha' forgot about it.    Well, so they were married. An' for 'leven months the gal had all the  vittles she liked to ate, and all the gownds she liked to git, and all  the cumpny she liked to have.    But when the time was gettin' oover, she began to think about them there  skeins an' to wonder if he had 'em in mind. But not one word did he say  about 'em, an' she whoolly thowt he'd forgot 'em.    Howsivir, the last day o' the last month, he takes her to a room she'd  niver set eyes on afore. There worn't nothin' in it but a spinnin' wheel  and a stool. An' says he, \"Now, me dear, hare you'll be shut in  to-morrow with some vittles and some flax, and if you hain't spun five  skeins by the night, yar hid'll goo off.\"    An' awa' he went about his business.    Well, she were that frightened. She'd allus been such a gatless gal,  that she didn't se much as know how to spin, an' what were she to dew  to-morrer, with no one to come nigh her to help her? She sat down on a  stool in the kitchen, and lork! how she did cry!    Howsivir, all on a sudden she hard a sort of a knockin' low down on the  door. She upped and oped it, an' what should she see but a small little  black thing with a long tail. That looked up at her right kewrious, an'  that said:    \"What are yew a-cryin' for?\"    \"Wha's that to yew?\" says she.    \"Niver yew mind,\" that said, \"but tell me what you're a cryin' for.\"    \"That oon't dew me noo good if I dew,\" says she.    \"Yew doon't know that,\" that said, an' twirled that's tail round.    \"Well,\" says she, \"that oon't dew no harm, if that doon't dew no good,\"  and she upped and told about the pies an' the skeins an' everything.    \"This is what I'll dew,\" says the little black thing: \"I'll come to yar  winder iv'ry mornin' an' take the flax an' bring it spun at night\"    \"What's your pay?\" says she.    That looked out o' the corners o' that's eyes an' that said: \"I'll give  you three guesses every night to guess my name, an' if you hain't  guessed it afore the month's up, yew shall be mine.\"    Well, she thowt she'd be sure to guess that's name afore the month was  up. \"All right,\" says she, \"I agree.\"    \"All right,\" that says, an' lork! how that twirled that's tail.    Well, the next day, har husband, he took her inter the room, an' there  was the flax an' the day's vittles.    \"Now, there's the flax,\" says he, \"an' if that ain't spun up this night,  off goo yar hid.\" An' then he went out an' locked the door.    He'd hardly goon, when there was a knockin' agin the winder.    She upped and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little oo'd  thing a settin' on the ledge.    \"Where's the flax?\" says he.    \"Here te be,\" says she. And she gonned it to him.    Well, come the evenin', a knockin' come agin to the winder. She upped  an' she oped it, and there were the little oo'd thing, with five skeins  of flax on his arm.    \"Here te be,\" says he, an' he gonned it to her.    \"Now, what's my name?\" says he.    \"What, is that Bill?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he. An' he twirled his tail.    \"Is that Ned?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he. An' he twirled his tail.    \"Well, is that Mark?\" says she.    \"Noo, that ain't,\" says he. An' he twirled his tail harder, an' awa' he  flew.    Well, when har husban' he come in, there was the five skeins riddy for  him.    \"I see I shorn't hev for to kill you to-night, me dare,\" says he.  \"You'll hev yar vittles and yar flax in the mornin',\" says he, an' away  he goes.    Well, ivery day the flax an' the vittles, they was browt, an' ivery day  that there little black impet used for to come mornin's and evenin's.  An' all the day the darter, she set a tryin' fur to think of names to  say to it when te come at night. But she niver hot on the right one. An'  as that got to-warts the ind o' the month, the impet that began for to  look soo maliceful, an' that twirled that's tail faster an' faster each  time she gave a guess.    At last te came to the last day but one. The impet that come at night  along o' the five skeins, an' that said:    \"What, hain't yew got my name yet?\"    \"Is that Nicodemus?\" says she.    \"Noo, t'ain't,\" that says.    \"Is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#20)"],[1,"en' z'n): flesh of deer.  vic to ry: triumph.  vol un teer: one who offers himself for a service.    wa ger (wa jer): bet.  wages: carries on.  wand: a small stick.  width: breadth.  wig wam: Indian tent.  wis dom: learning, knowledge.    yarn: thread.
