Schiller has a tragedy on the subject, Casimir Delavigne an  elegy on her, Southey an epic poem on her life and death, and Voltaire  a burlesque.    In regard to her death, M. Octave Delepiere, in his _Doute  Historique_, denies the tradition of her having been burnt to death at  Rouen; and Vignier discovered in a family muniment chest the \"contract  of marriage between\" Robert des Armoise, knight, and Jeanne d'Arc,  surnamed \"The Maid of Orleans.\"    AR'CADES AMBO, both fools alike; both \"sweet innocents;\" both alike  eccentric.

But with the Governments that have declared their  independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have recognized,  we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or  controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any  other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward  the United States.\"    From this time onward, Cuba appears as an almost continuous object of  special interest to both the people and the officials of the United States.  Notwithstanding this disclaimer of President Monroe's message, the idea  of the acquisition of the island, by the United States, soon arose. It  persisted through all the years down to the time of the Teller amendment,  in 1898, and there are many who even now regard annexation as inevitable at  some future time, more or less distant. The plan appears as a suggestion  in a communication, under date of November 30, 1825, from Alexander  H. Everett, then Minister to Madrid, to President Adams. It crops up  repeatedly in various quarters in later years. It would be a difficult and  tedious undertaking to chase through all the diplomatic records of seventy  years the references to Cuba and its affairs.    From that period until the present time, the affairs of the island have  been a matter of constant interest and frequent anxiety in Washington. Fear  of British acquisition of the island appears to have subsided about 1860,  but there were in the island two groups, both relatively small, one of  them working for independence, and the other for annexation to the  United States. The great majority, however, desired some fair measure of  self-government, and relief from economic and financial burdens, under the  Spanish flag. The purchase of the island by the United States was proposed  by President Polk, in 1848; by President Pierce, in 1854; and by President  Buchanan, in his time. Crises appeared from time to time. Among them was  the incident of the _Black Warrior_, in 1854. Mr. Rhodes thus describes the  affair, in his _History of the United States_:    \"_The Black Warrior_ was an American merchant steamer, plying between  Mobile and New York, stopping at Havana for passengers and mail. She had  made thirty-six such voyages, almost always having a cargo for the American  port, and never being permitted to bring freight into Havana. The custom  of her agent was to clear her 'in ballast' the day before her arrival. The  practice, while contrary to the regulations of Cuban ports, had always  been winked at by the authorities. It was well understood that the _Black  Warrior_ generally had a cargo aboard, but a detailed manifest of her load  had never been required. She had always been permitted to sail unmolested  until, when bound from Mobile to New York, she was stopped on the 28th of  February, 1854, by order of the royal exchequer, for having violated  the regulations of the port. The agent, finding that the cause of this  proceeding was the failure to manifest the cargo 'in transit,' offered to  amend the manifest, which under the rules he had a right to do; but this  the collector, on a flimsy pretext, refused to permit. The agent was at the  same time informed that the cargo was confiscated and the captain fined, in  pursuance of the custom-house regulations. The cargo was cotton, valued  at one hundred thousand dollars; and the captain was fined six thousand  dollars. The United States consul applied to the captain-general for  redress, but no satisfaction was obtained. A gang of men with lighters were  sent to the ship under the charge of the _commandante_, who ordered the  captain of the _Black Warrior_ to discharge her cargo. This he refused to  do. The _commandante_ then had the hatches opened, and his men began  to take out the bales of cotton. The captain hauled down his flag and  abandoned the vessel to the Spanish authorities.\"    The news of the incident created great excitement in Washington. President  Pierce sent a message to Congress, stating that demand had been made on  Spain for indemnity, and suggesting provisional legislation that would  enable him, if negotiations failed, \"to insure the observance of our just  rights, to obtain redress for injuries received, and to vindicate the honor  of our flag.\"    Mr. Soule, then the American Minister to Madrid, was the official through  whom the negotiations were conducted. He was a man of somewhat impetuous  temperament, and an ardent advocate of Cuba's annexation. He quite  overstepped both the bounds of propriety and of his authority in his  submission, under instructions, of a demand for three hundred thousand  dollars indemnity. This, and Spanish diplomatic methods, led to delay, and  the excitement died out. In the meantime, Spain released the vessel and its  cargo, disavowed and disapproved the conduct of the local officials, paid  the indemnity claimed by the owners of the vessel, and the ship resumed its  regular trips, being treated with every courtesy when visiting Havana. But  the incident gave rise to active discussion, and for a time threatened  serious results. It followed on the heels of another experience, the Lopez  expeditions, to which reference is made in another chapter, and came at a  time when Cuba and Cuban affairs were topics of a lively public interest.  The subject of acquisition was under general public discussion and occupied  a large share of public attention. Some wanted war with Spain, and others  proposed the purchase of the island from Spain. But the immediate cause  of complaint having been removed by the release of the ship, Soule was  instructed to take no further steps in the matter, and the excitement  gradually passed away.    Immediately following this experience, and growing out of it, came the  incident of the \"Ostend Manifesto.\" At that time, James Buchanan was  Minister to England. John Y. Mason was Minister to France, and Pierre Soule  was Minister to Spain. Secretary of State Marcy suggested a conference  between these three officials. They met at Ostend, but afterward  transferred their deliberations to Aix la Chapelle. The meeting attracted  general attention in Europe. The result of what they reported as \"a full  and unreserved interchange of views and sentiments,\" was a recommendation  that an earnest effort be made immediately to purchase Cuba. They were of  opinion that the sum of one hundred and twenty million dollars be offered.  The report proceeded thus: \"After we shall have offered Spain a price for  Cuba far beyond its present value, and this shall have been refused, it  will then be time to consider the question, does Cuba in the possession  of Spain seriously endanger our internal peace and the existence of our  cherished Union? Should this question be answered in the affirmative, then,  by every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from  Spain if we possess the power; and this upon the very same principle that  would justify an individual in tearing down the burning house of his  neighbor if there were no other means of preventing the flame from  destroying his own home.\" It is evident that Soule dominated the meeting,  and only less evident that he, in some way, cajoled his associates  into signing the report. No action was taken on the matter by the  Administration, and the incident has passed into history somewhat, perhaps,  as one of the curiosities of diplomacy. At all events, all historians note  it, and some give it considerable attention.    The next serious complication arose out of the Ten Years' War, in Cuba,  in 1868, to which reference is made in a chapter on Cuba's revolutions.  Spain's leaders seemed quite incapable of grasping the Cuban situation, of  seeing it in its proper light. It is more than probable that, even then,  the Cubans would have remained loyal if the Spanish authorities had paid  attention to their just and reasonable demands. As stated by Mr. Pepper,  in his _Tomorrow in Cuba_, \"The machete and the torch then gained what  peaceful agitation had not been able to achieve.\" The demands of the  Cubans are thus stated by Senor Cabrera, in his _Cuba and the Cubans_: \"A  constitutional system in place of the autocracy of the Captain-General,  freedom of the press, the right of petition, cessation of the exclusion of  Cubans from public office, unrestricted industrial liberty, abolition of  restrictions on the transfer of landed property, the right of assembly and  of association, representation in the Cortes, and local self-government,\"  all reasonable and just demands from every point of view of modern  civilization. Spain refused all, and on October 10, 1868, an actual  revolution began, the first in the history of the island to be properly  classed as a revolution. The United States soon became concerned and  involved. In his message to Congress on December 6, 1869, President Grant  said: \"For more than a year, a valuable province of Spain, and a near  neighbor of ours, in whom all our people cannot but feel a deep interest,  has been struggling for independence and freedom. The people and the  Government of the United States entertain the same warm feelings and  sympathies for the people of Cuba in their pending struggle that they have  manifested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and her former  colonies (Mexico, Central America and South America) in behalf of the  latter. But the contest has at no time assumed the conditions which amount  to a war in the sense of international law, or which would show the  existence of a _de facto_ political organization of the insurgents  sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency.\" On June 13, 1870,  President Grant sent a special message to Congress, in which he reviewed  the Cuban situation. Another reference appears in his message of December  5, 1870. In his message of December 4, 1871, he stated that \"it is to be  regretted that"]]]
