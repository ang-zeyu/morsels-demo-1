The second criticism--that Buddhists are prone to corrupt their faith--is  just, for their courteous acquiescence in other creeds enfeebles and  denaturalizes their own. In Annam, Korea and some parts of China though  there are temples and priests more or less deserving the name of  Buddhist, there is no idea that Buddhism is a distinct religion or mode  of life. Such statements as that the real religion of the Burmese is not  Buddhism but animism are, I think, incorrect, but even the Burmese are  dangerously tolerant.    This weakness is not due to any positive defect, since Buddhism provides  for those who lead the higher life a strenuous curriculum and for the  laity a system of morality based on rational grounds and differing  little from the standard accepted in both Europe and China, except that  it emphasizes the duties of mankind to animals. The weakness comes from  the absence of any command against superstitious rites and beliefs. When  the cardinal principles of Buddhism are held strongly these accessories  do not matter, but the time comes when the creeper which was once an  ornament grows into the walls of the shrine and splits the masonry. The  faults of western religions are mainly faults of self-assertion--such as  the Inquisition and opposition to science. The faults of Indian  religions are mainly tolerance of what does not belong to them and  sometimes of what is not only foreign to them but bad in itself.    Buddhism has been both praised and blamed as a religion which  acknowledges neither God nor the soul[88] and its acceptance in its  later phases of the supernatural has been regarded as proving the human  mind's natural need of theism. But it is rather an illustration of that  craving for personal though superhuman help which makes Roman Catholics  supplement theism with the worship of saints.    On the whole it is correct to say that Buddhism (except perhaps in very  exceptional sects) has always taken and still takes a point of view  which has little in common with European theism. The world is not  thought of as the handiwork of a divine personality nor the moral law as  his will. The fact that religion can exist without these ideas is of  capital importance[89]. But any statements implying that Buddhism  divorces morality from the doctrine of immortality may be misunderstood  for it teaches that just as an old man may suffer for the follies of his  youth, so faults committed in one life may be punished in another.  Rewards and punishments in another world were part of the creed of Asoka  and tradition represents the missionaries who converted Ceylon as using  this simple argument[90]. It would not however be true to say that  Buddhism makes the value of morality contingent on another world. The  life of an Arhat which includes the strictest morality is commended on  its own account as the best and happiest existence.    European assertions about Buddhism often imply that it sets up as an  ideal and goal either annihilation or some condition of dreamy bliss.  Modern Buddhists who mostly neglect Nirvana as something beyond their  powers, just as the ordinary Christian does not say that he hopes to  become a saint, lose much of the Master's teaching but do it less  injustice than such misrepresentations. The Buddha did not describe  Nirvana as something to be won after death, but as a state of happiness  attainable in this life by strenuous endeavour--a state of perfect peace  but compatible with energy, as his own example showed.      25. _Interest of Indian Thought for Europe_    We are now in a better position to answer the question asked at the  beginning of this introduction, Is Indian thought of value or at least  of interest for Europe?    Let me confess that I cannot share the confidence in the superiority of  Europeans and their ways which is prevalent in the west. Whatever view  we take of the rights and wrongs of the recent war, it is clearly absurd  for Europe as a whole to pose in the presence of such doings as a  qualified instructor in humanity and civilization. Many of those who are  proudest of our fancied superiority escape when the chance offers from  western civilization and seek distraction in exploration, and many who  have spent their lives among what they consider inferior races are  uneasy when they retire and settle at home. In fact European  civilization is not satisfying and Asia can still offer something more  attractive to many who are far from Asiatic in spirit. Yet though most  who have paid even a passing visit to the East feel its charm, the  history, art and literature of Asia are still treated with ignorant  indifference in cultured circles--an ignorance and indifference which are  extraordinary in Englishmen who have so close a connection with India  and devote a disproportionate part of their education to ancient Greece  and Rome. I have heard a professor of history in an English university  say that he thought the history of India began with the advent of the  British and that he did not know that China had any history at all. And  Matthew Arnold in speaking of Indian thought[91] hardly escaped meriting  his own favourite epithets of condemnation, Philistine and _saugrenu_.    Europeans sometimes mention it as an amazing and almost ridiculous  circumstance that an educated Chinese can belong to three religions,  Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. But I find this attitude of mind  eminently sensible. Confucianism is an admirable religion for State  ceremonies and College chapels. By attending its occasional rites one  shows a decent respect for Heaven and Providence and commits oneself to  nothing. And though a rigid Confucianist may have the contempt of a  scholar and statesman for popular ideas, yet the most devout Buddhist  and Taoist can conform to Confucianism without scruple, whereas many who  have attended an English coronation service must have wondered at the  language which they seemed to approve of by their presence. And in China  if you wish to water the aridity of Confucianism, you can find in  Buddhism or Taoism whatever you want in the way of emotion or philosophy  and you will not be accused of changing your religion because you take  this refreshment. This temper is not good for creating new and profound  religious thought, but it is good for sampling and appreciating the  \"varieties of religious experience\" which offer their results as guides  for this and other lives.    For religion is systematized religious experience and this experience  depends on temperament. There can therefore be no one religion in the  European sense and it is one of the Hindus' many merits that they  recognize this. Some people ask of religion forgiveness for their sins,  others communion with the divine: most want health and wealth, many  crave for an explanation of life and death. Indian religion accommodates  itself to these various needs. Nothing is more surprising than the  variety of its phases except the underlying unity.    This power of varying in sympathetic response to the needs of many minds  and growing in harmony with the outlook of successive ages, is a  contrast to the pretended _quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab  omnibus_[92] of Western Churches, for in view of their differences and  mutual hostility it can only be called a pretence. Indians recognize  that only the greatest and simplest religious questions can be asked now  in the same words that came to the lips more than two thousand years ago  and even if the questions are the same, the answers of the thoughtful  are still as widely divergent as the pronouncements of the Buddha and  the Brahmans. But nearly all the propositions contained in a European  creed involve matters of history or science which are obviously affected  by research and discovery as much as are astronomy or medicine, and not  only are the propositions out of date but they mostly refer to problems  which have lost their interest. But Indian religion eschews creeds and  will not die with the spread of knowledge. It will merely change and  enter a new phase of life in which much that is now believed and  practised will be regarded as the gods and rites of the Veda are  regarded now.    I do not think that there is much profit in comparing religions, which  generally means exalting one at the expense of the others, but rather  that it is interesting and useful to learn what others, especially those  least like ourselves, think of these matters. And in religious questions  Asia has a distinct right to be heard.    For if Europeans have any superiority over Asiatics, it lies in  practical science, finance and administration, not in thought or art. If  one were collecting views about philosophy and religion in Europe, one  would not begin by consulting financiers and engineers, and the  policeman who stands in the middle of the street and directs the traffic  to this side and that is not intellectually superior to those who obey  him as if he were something superhuman. Europeans in Asia are like such  a policeman: their gifts are authority and power to organize: in other  respects their superiority is imaginary.    I do not think that Christianity will ever make much progress in Asia,  for what is commonly known by that name is not the teaching of Christ  but a rearrangement of it made in Europe and like most European  institutions practical rather than thoughtful. And as for the teaching  of Christ himself, the Indian finds it excellent but not ample or  satisfying. There is little in it which cannot be found in some of the  many scriptures of Hinduism and it is silent on many points about which  they speak, if not with convincing authority, at least with suggestive  profundity. Neither do I think that Europe is likely to adopt Buddhist  or Brahmanic methods of thought on any large scale.

John of Gorz now proposes the only practicable course, that Abdurrahman  should send a fresh embassy to Otho and ask for instructions for his  ambassadors under the circumstances. Recemundus,[1] a Christian, offers  to go as ambassador, if a vacant bishopric be given him as a reward. He  sets out and reaches Gorz in February 956. Otho gives him a fresh  letter, with instructions to suppress the former one, to conclude an  alliance with the Sultan, and make an arrangement with him for putting  down the brigands who infested the marches.        [1] De Gayangos, on Al Makkari, ii. p. 464, identifies him with      Rabi, a bishop mentioned as an ambassador of Abdurrahman III.      in Al Makkari, i. 236, ii. 139; but Rabi may have been the      bishop who died during the embassy to Otho. Recemundus, as De      Gayangos (1.1.) says, was a katib or clerk of the palace.    Leaving Gorz with Dudo, the emperor's legate, on March 30, he reached  Cordova on June 1st, but the Sultan declined to receive the second  comers till he had received the earlier embassy. So, after three years  semi-captivity, John is released, and told to prepare himself for the  king's presence by shaving, washing, and putting on new apparel. He  declines to go in any otherwise than he is; and even when the king,  thinking his refusal due to poverty, sends him a sum of money, the monk  accepts the gift and distributes it to the poor, but says he will only  see the king as a poor monk. The king good-naturedly said: \"Let him come  as he likes.\" On June 21, 956, the ambassadors were conducted to the  king's presence along a road thronged with sight-seers. The steps of the  palace were laid down with tapestry, and a guard of honour lined both  sides of the approach. On John's entrance, the king, as a great mark of  distinction, gave him his open palm to kiss, and beckoned him to a seat  near his own couch. After a silence Abdurrahman apologised to the monk  for the long delay which he had been obliged to impose on the embassy,  and which was in no sense due to disrespect for John himself, whose  virtue and wisdom he could not but acknowledge. As a proof that this was  no mere empty compliment, the king expressed his readiness to give him  whatever he asked. John's wrath vanishes at these gracious words, and  they talk amicably together. But when the monk asks leave to depart  Abdurrahman says:--\"After waiting so long to see one another, shall we  part so soon?\" He suggests that they should have at least three  interviews. At their next meeting they discourse on the respective power  of the empires of Otho and the Khalif himself; and the Sultan, taught by  the experience of Spain, points out the unwisdom of allowing feudal  subjects to become too powerful, by dividing kingdoms between them.    So ends this unique and interesting fragment, which throws so pleasant a  light on the character and the Court of the greatest of Spanish Sultans,  and proves that the Christians at that time enjoyed considerable  freedom, and even honour, at the hands of the Moslem Government.    The reason why the king was unwilling to receive the first letter  brought by John was not so much because he was reluctant to read words  against Mohammed, as because he would by so doing render himself liable  to the penalty of death, which was ordained by law to any Moslem--king  or slave--who listened to abuse of the Prophet without exacting summary  vengeance from the blasphemer. But--and here was the king's dilemma--he  could not punish the ambassadors without incurring the enmity of Otho.  The only possible alternative was that suggested by John, that Otho  should be asked to withdraw the objectionable letter, without the Sultan  having officially read it, and this Abdurrahman adopted. The moderation  of the king is conspicuous throughout, for we must regard the threat  against the Christians as merely a threat, never really intended to be  put into execution.    In showing tolerance towards their Christian subjects, the Spanish  khalifs might be thought to have forgotten the traditions of Islam; but,  as a matter of fact, Mohammed seems to have been very inconsistent in  his views with regard to Christians and Jews at different times of his  career, and while he enjoined the necessity of Holy Wars,[1] he  permitted the people of the book to be admitted to tribute.[2] In one  passage he even seems to allow the possibility of salvation to Jews,  Christians, and Sabians: \"Verily they who believe, and those who  Judaize, and the Sabians, and the Christians--whoever of these believeth  in God and the last day, and doeth that which is right--there shall come  no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved.\"[3] And there is one  remarkable text to find in the mouth of Mohammed, \"Let there be no  violence in religion.\" [4]    Moreover, some of the best Mohammedan rulers that have ever lived upheld  the same principle of toleration. Abbas II., one of the Persian Sufis,  is reported to have said: \"It is for God, not for me, to judge of men's  consciences, and I will never interfere with what belongs to the  tribunal of the great Creator and Lord of the Universe.\"[5] Again,  Akbar, one of the greatest kings that ever lived, followed in practice  the principle thus expressed by his minister, Abul Fazl: \"Persecution  after all defeats its own ends; it obliges men to conceal their  opinions, but produces no change in them.\"[6] Noble sentiments surely,  and such as we should expect from followers of Christ rather than of  Mohammed!        [1] Tradition attributes even stronger approval of Holy Wars to      Mohammed than can be found in the Koran,--_e.g._, \"The sword is      the key of Paradise and Hell. A drop of blood shed in the cause      of God, a night spent in arms, are of more avail than two      months of fasting and prayer. Whoever falls in battle against      the infidel, his sins are forgiven him.\"        [2] Koran, xlvii., ad init.        [3] Koran, v., v. 73. This may be said in the general sense of      Acts x. 35.        [4] Koran, ii., v. 258.        [5] See Freeman's \"Saracens,\" p. 230; from Malcolm's \"Persia,\"      i. p 583.        [6] _Ibid._, from \"Ayeen Akbery,\" p. 11.    Yet far too often have portions of the Christian Church been conspicuous  for intolerance rather than tolerance. Alcuin, indeed, does say in his  letter to Aquila, Bishop of Winchester, that he does not approve of  punishing heresy with death, because God, by the mouth of His prophet,  had said: \"I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the  wicked turn from his way and live;\"[1] but Alcuin was a man of unusual  mildness and sweet reasonableness, as his letters to Felix and Elipandus  testify. On the other hand, there were too many frantic bigots in the  Church, like Arnold of Citeaux, whose impious words, in connection with  the massacre of Albigensians, are not likely to be forgotten--\"Slay all;  God will know His own.\"    In fact, so opposed did the Christian spirit come to be to the  Mohammedan in this respect, that their toleration was made a principal  argument against the Moors by the Archbishop of Valencia in his memorial  to Philip III. at the end of the sixteenth century.[2]    A very melancholy instance of bigotry and intolerance is afforded by  Bernard, a French monk, who was made Archbishop of Toledo by Alfonso, on  the capture of that city in 1085. By the treaty of capitulation certain  mosques had been expressly reserved to the Moslems, just in the same way  as certain churches had been reserved for the Christians by Musa in 712.  But Bernard, by way of showing his zeal in the cause of God, in defiance  of the king's plighted word, chose to perform mass in the chief mosque.  Alfonso was furiously angry when he heard of his archbishop's  proceedings, but the Moslems, with wonderful forbearance, seeing that  the king had not authorised Bernard's outrageous conduct, came forward  of their own accord and begged him to pardon the act, and even  voluntarily surrendered their mosque.[3]    Not only were the Christians allowed to practise their religion, but  even, as we have seen above, encouraged in it.[4] Almanzor, the champion  of Islam, allowed his Christian servants to rest on Sundays. Christians  in every reign held high posts at court[5] and throughout the land, and  not only timeserving Christians but men like Samson and Leovigild, who  were known to sympathise with the party of zealots, were employed by the  king to write letters to, and negotiate with, the neighbouring kings.  This was no doubt due to their general trustworthiness, their quickness,  and their knowledge of Arabic as well as Latin.        [1] Ezekiel xxxiii. 11.        [2] Prescott, \"Ferd. and Isab.,\" p. 376, n.        [3] Mariana, ix. 10.        [4] See p. 57. Recent history affords a similar instance from      the Christian side. See \"Gordon in Central Africa,\" p. 54--\"I      have made them make a mosque, and keep the Ramadhan.\" _Ibid._,      p. 249, \"I had the mosque cleared out and restored for worship,      and endowed the priests and crier, and had a great ceremony at      the opening of it.... They blessed me and cursed Zebehr Pasha      who took the mosque from them. To me it appears that the      Mussulman worships God as well as I do, and is as acceptable,      if sincere, as any Christian.\"        [5] Such as secretary, farmer of taxes, or even prime minister.    Among the great functionaries of state there was one who held the office  of Kitabatu-dh-dhimam, which, being interpreted, is \"the office of  protection.\" The Christians and Jews were under his general  jurisdiction, and were called \"the people of the protection.\"[1] But  besides this Arab \"Secretary of State for the Christians,\" the latter  had their own counts--a relic of the Gothic system--who, however, did  not always stand up for their interests.[2] There were also"]]]
