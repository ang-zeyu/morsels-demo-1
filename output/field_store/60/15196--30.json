We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced  back from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if  anywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third  order we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This  brings up the question whether wishes arising from these different  sources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the  same power to incite a dream.    On reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this  question, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the  dream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such  as thirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of  the dream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. That a  wish suppressed during the day asserts itself in the dream can be shown  by a great many examples. I shall mention a very simple example of this  class. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose younger friend has become  engaged to be married, is asked throughout the day by her acquaintances  whether she knows and what she thinks of the fiance. She answers with  unqualified praise, thereby silencing her own judgment, as she would  prefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an ordinary person. The  following night she dreams that the same question is put to her, and  that she replies with the formula: \"In case of subsequent orders it will  suffice to mention the number.\" Finally, we have learned from numerous  analyses that the wish in all dreams that have been subject to  distortion has been derived from the unconscious, and has been unable to  come to perception in the waking state. Thus it would appear that all  wishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation.    I am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really  different, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent  determination of the dream-wish. Children's dreams leave no doubt that  an unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But  we must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it  is a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt  whether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream  in an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our  impulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the  formation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to  childhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some  retain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The  differences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of  the originally distinct visual imagination.    In general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the  day are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that  the wish instigators originating in conscious like contribute towards  the incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not  originate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another  source.    That source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a  dream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish  which reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the  psychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes  are always active and ready for expression whenever they find an  opportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and  that they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of  the latter.[1] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has  been realized in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of  this dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the  unconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the  unconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have  borne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the  victorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the  convulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the  repression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned  from the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,  therefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is  unimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,  as follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one_.  In the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no  separation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where  these are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and  unrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception  cannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it  can be frequently demonstrated, even when it was not suspected, and that  it cannot be generally refuted.    The wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,  therefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the  dream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the  material of actual sensations during sleep. If I now take into account  those other psychic instigations remaining from the waking state which  are not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out for me by  this train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally terminating the  sum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go to sleep. He is a  good sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed to have been a  model of this sort. But we do not always succeed in accomplishing it, or  in accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems, harassing cares,  overwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity even during  sleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we have termed  the foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into sleep may be  divided into the following groups: 1, That which has not been terminated  during the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which has been left  unfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power, _i.e._ the  unsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed during the day.  This unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that which has been  excited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the foreconscious.  Finally, we may add group (5) consisting of the indifferent and hence  unsettled impressions of the day.    We should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by  these remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group  of the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for  expression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that  the sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the  excitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by  its becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of  our mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not  asleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the  Forec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the  psychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of  energy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to  motility, which is paralyzed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,  there seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the  assumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the  conditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in  the Force, there remains no other path than that followed by the wish  excitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from  the Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But  what is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?  There is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that  they utilize the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness  even during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream  content, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also  certain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character  as that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for  the theory of wish-fulfillment to see what conditions they must comply  with in order to be received into the dream.    Let us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the  dream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow's  disease. My friend Otto's appearance occasioned me some concern during  the day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this person,  affected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me into  sleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with him.  In the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have  reported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to  show any wish-fulfillment. But I began to investigate for the source of  this incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and  analysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a  certain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one  explanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for  the day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to  identify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realization of one of  the immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive  ideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated  in a waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the  dream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression  through a substitution in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#20)"],[1," children of Abraham.    Paul is saying: \"You know from the example of Abraham and from the plain  testimony of the Scriptures that they are the children of Abraham, who  have faith in Christ, regardless of their nationality, regardless of the  Law, regardless of works, regardless of their parentage. The promise was  made unto Abraham, 'Thou shalt be a father of many nations'; again, 'And  in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.'\" To prevent the  Jews from misinterpreting the word \"nations,\" the Scriptures are careful  to say \"many nations.\" The true children of Abraham are the believers in  Christ from all nations.        VERSE 8. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the    heathen through faith.    \"Your boasting does not get you anywhere,\" says Paul to the Galatians,  \"because the Sacred Scriptures foresaw and foretold long before the  Law was ever given, that the heathen should be justified by the blessed  'seed' of Abraham and not by the Law. This promise was made four hundred  and thirty years before the Law was given. Because the Law was given so  many years after Abraham, it could not abolish the promised blessing.\"  This argument is strong because it is based on the exact factor of time.  \"Why should you boast of the Law, my Galatians, when the Law came four  hundred and thirty years after the promise?\"    The false apostles glorified the Law and despised the promise made  unto Abraham, although it antedated the Law by many years. It was after  Abraham was accounted righteous because of his faith that the Scriptures  first make mention of circumcision. \"The Scriptures,\" says Paul, \"meant  to forestall your infatuation for the righteousness of the Law by  installing the righteousness of faith before circumcision and the Law  ever were ordained.\"        VERSE 8. Preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall    all nations be blessed.    The Jews misconstrue this passage. They want the term \"to bless\" to  mean \"to praise.\" They want the passage to read: In thee shall all the  nations of the earth be praised. But this is a perversion of the  words of Holy Writ. With the words \"Abraham believed\" Paul describes a  spiritual Abraham, renewed by faith and regenerated by the Holy Ghost,  that he should be the spiritual father of many nations. In that way all  the Gentiles could be given to him for an inheritance.    The Scriptures ascribe no righteousness to Abraham except through faith.  The Scriptures speak of Abraham as he stands before God, a man justified  by faith. Because of his faith God extends to him the promise: \"In thee  shall all nations be blessed.\"        VERSE 9. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful    Abraham.    The emphasis lies on the words \"with faithful Abraham.\" Paul  distinguishes between Abraham and Abraham. There is a working and there  is a believing Abraham. With the working Abraham we have nothing to do.  Let the Jews glory in the generating Abraham; we glory in the believing  Abraham of whom the Scriptures say that he received the blessing of  righteousness by faith, not only for himself but for all who believe as  he did. The world was promised to Abraham because he believed. The whole  world is blessed if it believes as Abraham believed.    The blessing is the promise of the Gospel. That all nations are to be  blessed means that all nations are to hear the Gospel. All nations are  to be declared righteous before God through faith in Christ Jesus. To  bless simply means to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ's salvation.  This is the office of the New Testament Church which distributes  the promised blessing by preaching the Gospel, by administering the  sacraments, by comforting the broken-hearted, in short, by dispensing  the benefits of Christ.    The Jews exhibited a working Abraham. The Pope exhibits a working  Christ, or an exemplary Christ. The Pope quotes Christ's saying recorded  in John 13:15, \"I have given you an example, that ye should do as I  have done to you.\" We do not deny that Christians ought to imitate the  example of Christ; but mere imitation will not satisfy God. And bear  in mind that Paul is not now discussing the example of Christ, but  the salvation of Christ. That Abraham submitted to circumcision at the  command of God, that he was endowed with excellent virtues, that he  obeyed God in all things, was certainly admirable of him. To follow  the example of Christ, to love one's neighbor, to do good to them  that persecute you, to pray for one's enemies, patiently to bear  the ingratitude of those who return evil for good, is certainly  praiseworthy. But praiseworthy or not, such virtues do not acquit us  before God. It takes more than that to make us righteous before God. We  need Christ Himself, not His example, to save us. We need a redeeming,  not an exemplary Christ, to save us. Paul is here speaking of the  redeeming Christ and the believing Abraham, not of the model Christ or  the sweating Abraham.    The believing Abraham is not to lie buried in the grave. He is to be  dusted off and brought out before the world. He is to be praised to the  sky for his faith. Heaven and earth ought to know about him and about  his faith in Christ. The working Abraham ought to look pretty small next  to the believing Abraham.    Paul's words contain the implication of contrast. When he quotes  Scripture to the effect that all nations that share the faith of  faithful Abraham are to be blessed, Paul means to imply the contrast  that all nations are accursed without faith in Christ.        VERSE 10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the    curse.    The curse of God is like a flood that swallows everything that is not of  faith. To avoid the curse we must hold on to the promise of the blessing  in Christ.    The reader is reminded that all this has no bearing upon civil laws,  customs, or political matters. Civil laws and ordinances have their  place and purpose. Let every government enact the best possible laws.  But civil righteousness will never deliver a person from the  condemnation of God's Law.    I have good reason for calling your attention to this. People easily  mistake civil righteousness for spiritual righteousness. In civil  life we must, of course, pay attention to laws and deeds, but in the  spiritual life we must not think to be justified by laws and works, but  always keep in mind the promise and blessing of Christ, our only Savior.    According to Paul everything that is not of faith is sin. When our  opponents hear us repeat this statement of Paul, they make it appear as  if we taught that governments should not be honored, as if we favored  rebellion against the constituted authorities, as if we condemned  all laws. Our opponents do us a great wrong, for we make a clear-cut  distinction between civil and spiritual affairs.    Governmental laws and ordinances are blessings of God for this life  only. As for everlasting life, temporal blessings are not good enough.  Unbelievers enjoy more temporal blessings than the Christians. Civil  or legal righteousness may be good enough for this life but not for the  life hereafter. Otherwise the infidels would be nearer heaven than the  Christians, for infidels often excel in civil righteousness.        VERSE 10. For it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in     all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.    Paul goes on to prove from this quotation out of the Book of Deuteronomy  that all men who are under the Law are under the sentence of sin, of  the wrath of God, and of everlasting death. Paul produces his proof in  a roundabout way. He turns the negative statement, \"Cursed is every one  that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the  law to do them,\" into a positive statement, \"As many as are of the works  of the law are under the curse.\" These two statements, one by Paul and  the other by Moses, appear to conflict. Paul declares, \"Whosoever shall  do the works of the Law, is accursed.\" Moses declares, \"Whosoever  shall not do the works of the Law, is accursed.\" How can these two  contradictory statements be reconciled? How can the one statement prove  the other? No person can hope to understand Paul unless he understands  the article of justification. These two statements are not at all  inconsistent.    We must bear in mind that to do the works of the Law does not mean only  to live up to the superficial requirements of the Law, but to obey the  spirit of the Law to perfection. But where will you find the person who  can do that? Let him step forward and we will praise him.    Our opponents have their answer ready-made. They quote Paul's own  statement in Romans 2:13, \"The doers of the law shall be justified.\"  Very well. But let us first find out who the doers of the law are. They  call a \"doer\" of the Law one who performs the Law in its literal sense.  This is not to \"do\" the Law. This is to sin. When our opponents go about  to perform the Law they sin against the first, the second, and the third  commandments, in fact they sin against the whole Law. For God requires  above all that we worship Him in spirit and in faith. In observing the  Law for the purpose of obtaining righteousness without faith in Christ  these law-workers go smack against the Law and against God. They deny  the righteousness of God, His mercy, and His promises. They deny Christ  and all His benefits.    In their ignorance of the true purpose of the Law the exponents of the  Law abuse the Law, as Paul says, Romans 10:3, \"For they, being  ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own  righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of  God.\"    In their folly our opponents rush into the Scriptures, pick out a  sentence here and a sentence there about the Law and imagine they know  all about it. Their work-righteousness is plain"]]]
