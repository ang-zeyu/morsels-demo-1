He was a very  kind and generous man, and loved all the wood-creatures dearly, often  feeding them from his own larder, and protecting them from their  enemies. So the animals and birds loved him as their best friend, and he  was known as the Good Hunter.    The Good Hunter was very brave, and often went to war with the fierce  savages who were the enemies of his tribe. One sad day he set forth with  a war party, and they had a terrible battle, in which the Good Hunter  was slain, and his enemies took away his scalp, leaving him lying dead  in the forest.    The Good Hunter had not remained long cold and lifeless in the shadowy  stillness, when the Fox came trotting through the woods. \"Alack and  alas!\" cried the Fox, spying the body stretched on the leaves. \"Here is  our dear friend, the Good Hunter, slain! Alack and alas! what shall we  do now that our dear friend and protector is gone?\"    The Fox ran out into the forest crying the death lament, which was the  signal to all the beasts that something most sorrowful had happened.  Soon they came flocking to the spot, all the animals of the forest. By  hundreds they came, and surrounding the body of their friend raised the  most doleful howls. For, though they rubbed him with their warm noses,  and licked him with their warm tongues, and nestled against him with  their warm fur, they could not bring him back to warm life.    They called upon Brother Bear to speak and tell them what to do; for he  was the nearest relative to man. The Bear sat up on his haunches and  spoke to the sad assembly with tears in his eyes, begging each animal to  look carefully through his medicine-box and see whether there might not  be some balm which would restore the Good Hunter to life. Then each  animal looked carefully through his medicine-box of herbs and healing  roots, bark and magic leaves, and they tried every remedy that they  knew. But nothing brought the color to their friend's pale cheeks, nor  light into his eyes. He who had helped them so often was helpless now,  and they could not aid him. Again the kind beasts sank back on their  haunches and raised a mighty howl, a requiem for the dead.    Wild and piercing and long-drawn, the sound swept through the forest,  such a sound of sorrow as had never been heard before. The Oriole, who  was flying overhead, heard and was surprised. Soon his brightness came  flashing down through the leafy boughs like a ray of sunlight into the  gloom and darkness of the forest.    \"What has happened, O four-footed friends,\" he asked, \"that you mourn so  mightily?\" Then they showed him the body of the Good Hunter lying in the  midst of their sad company, and the Oriole joined his voice of sorrow to  theirs.    \"O friend of the birds,\" he cried, \"is there no bird who can aid you  now, you who have fed us so many times from the door of your generous  wigwam? I will call all the feathered tribes, and we will do our best.\"    So the Oriole went forth and summoned the birds to the forest council.  There was a great flapping of wings, a great twittering and chirping,  questioning and exclamation when the birds assembled to hear the sad  news. Every one was there, from the tiny Humming Bird to the great  Eagle of the Iroquois, who left his lonely eyrie to pay his respects to  the Good Hunter's memory. The poor little birds tried everything in  their power to bring back to life their dear friend. With beak and claw  and tender wing they strove, but all their efforts were in vain. Their  Good Hunter was dead, and his scalp was gone.    Then the great Eagle, whose head was white with years of wisdom and  experience, spoke to the despairing assemblage of creatures. From his  lofty perch above the world the Eagle had looked down upon centuries of  change and decay. He knew every force of nature and all the strange  things of life. The hoary-headed sage said that the Good Hunter could  not be restored until his scalp was found. Then all the animals clamored  that they might be allowed to go and seek for the missing scalp. But to  the Fox was given this honor, because he had first found the body of the  Good Hunter in the forest. The Fox set out upon his search, in his foxy  way. He visited every hen-roost and every bird's-nest, but no scalp did  he find. \"Of course not!\" screamed the birds when he returned from his  fruitless quest, \"Of course no bird has taken the Good Hunter's scalp.  You should have known better than that, Master Fox.\"    So the next time a bird was sent upon the search. The Pigeon Hawk went  forth, confident that she should be successful. But she was in such a  hurry and flew so fast that she saw nothing, and she too returned  without that for which she sought. Then the White Heron begged that he  might be allowed to try. \"For,\" said he, \"you all know how slowly I fly,  and how careful I am to see everything.\"    \"Yes, especially if it be something good to eat,\" chirped the saucy Jay,  \"do not trust him, birds, he is too greedy.\"    Yet the Heron was allowed to go. He flapped away, slowly and sedately,  and the Council sat down to await his return. But the Heron had not gone  far when he came to a field of luscious wild beans; and he stopped to  take a mouthful or two. He ate, and he ate, and he ate, the greedy  fellow! until he could eat no more. And then he was sleepy, so that he  slept and slept and slept. And when he awoke he was so hungry that he  fell to eating again, while the Council waited and wondered and waited.  At last they grew impatient and began to suspect that the Jay had been  right, which was indeed the case. They decided to wait no longer for the  Heron, who did not return. Then the Crow stepped forward and said, \"Let  me go, I pray you, for I think I know where the scalp may be found; not  in the nest of a bird, not in the den of any animal, not in the watery  haunt of a fish. For all the creatures of earth, air, and water are  friends of the Good Hunter. It is men who are most cruel to men:  therefore in the tents of men must we look for the missing scalp. Let me  go to seek it there, for men are used to see me flying near and will not  suspect why I come.\"    The Crow flew forth upon his errand, and before long came to the wigwam  where lived the warrior who had slain the Good Hunter. And sure enough,  there, outside the tent, was the scalp of the Good Hunter, stretched on  a pole to dry. The Crow flew near, and the warrior saw him, but thought  nothing of it, for he was used to seeing crows about the camp. Presently  when no one was looking the skillful thief managed to steal the scalp,  and away he flew with it to the Council in the forest. Great was the  rejoicing of the birds and beasts when they saw that the Crow had been  successful, and they said more kind things to him than he had heard for  many moons. At once they put the scalp upon the Good Hunter's head, but  it had grown so dry in the smoke of the warrior's wigwam that it would  not fit. Here was a new trouble. What was to be done to make the scalp  soft and flexible once more? The animals did their best, but their  efforts were of no avail.    Once more the great Eagle came forward and bade them listen.    \"My children,\" he said, \"my wings are never furled. Night and day for  hundreds of years the dews of heaven have been collecting upon my back  as I sit on my throne above the clouds. Perhaps this dew may have a  healing power such as no earthly fountain holds. We will see.\"    Gravely the Eagle plucked a long feather, and dipping it in the dew  which moistened his plumage, applied it to the stiffened scalp.  Immediately it became soft, and could be fitted to the head of the Good  Hunter closely as when it had first grown there. The birds and animals  hurried away and brought leaves and flowers, bark and berries and roots,  which they made into a mighty healing balsam to bathe the poor head  which had been so cruelly treated. And presently great was their joy to  see a soft color come into the pale cheeks of the Good Hunter, and light  into his eyes. He breathed, he stirred, he sat up and looked around him  in surprise.    \"Where am I? What has happened?\" he asked.    \"You slept and your friends have wakened you,\" said the great Eagle  tenderly. \"Stand up, Good Hunter, that they may see you walk once more.\"    The Good Hunter stood up and walked, rather unsteadily at first, back to  his own wigwam, followed by a great company of happy forest creatures,  who made the sky ring with their noises of rejoicing. And long, long  after that, the Good Hunter lived to love and protect them.          THE COURTSHIP OF MR. STORK AND MISS HERON      This is a very good story to read at night just before going to sleep.  And if you ask why, I must only tell you that you will find out before  you reach the end of the tale.           *       *       *       *       *    There was once a Heron, a pretty, long-legged, slender lady Heron, who  lived in the mushy-squshy, wady-shady swamp. The lady Heron lived in her  swamp all alone, earning her living by catching little fish; and she was  very happy, never dreaming that she was lonesome, for no one had told  her what lonesome was. She loved to go wading in the cool waters; she  loved to catch the little fish who swam by unsuspectingly while she  stood still upon one leg pretending to think about something a thousand  miles away. And she loved to look at her slender, long-legged blue  reflection in the water; for the lady Heron was just a little bit vain.    Now one day Mr. Stork came flying over the mushy-squshy, wady-shady  swamp where the Heron lived, and he too saw the reflection in the water.  And he said to himself, \"My! How pretty she is! I wonder I never noticed  her before. And how lonesome she must be there all by herself in such a  nasty, moist, mushy-squshy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#20)"],[1,"marshes always commenced;  but along the southern bank of the river, to the point where its mouth  actually disembogued into the open bay, the land was of a fertile  description: the country, even in the dry season, during which we were  there, being covered with rich grass.    I ought here to state that this river is the most southern one that I  have ascertained to be deficient in that universal characteristic of all  those in the south-west of this continent: an estuary. I must observe  that I have not seen the mouths of three or four of the rivers before  enumerated, and cannot therefore say that some of them may not terminate  in estuaries; but the Gascoyne discharges its waters by two mouths of  considerable magnitude, between which lies Babbage Island, the southern  mouth being in latitude 24 degrees 57 minutes.    This is also the most southern river on the western side of this  continent where the rise and fall of tide is sufficiently great to  exercise any influence upon it relatively to the purposes of navigation.  Hence it would appear that the presence of estuaries at the mouths of  rivers on this coast is in some way connected with the amount of tidal  elevation at the points where they are found. The rise and fall here was  about five and a half feet; but there is only one full tide in  twenty-four hours. The first tide rises to a certain point, and it has  scarcely commenced to ebb, ere the second comes slowly in, so that, to a  careless observer, only one tide is perceptible.    PROVINCE OF VICTORIA.    The province of Victoria is situated between the parallels of 27 degrees  30 minutes and 29 degrees 30 minutes south latitude; its most  considerable river is the Hutt, which disembogues into a large estuary. A  few miles above the estuary the river separates into two branches, both  of which were running strong at the time we passed them.    Previously to our reaching the Hutt our boats had all been wrecked; I had  therefore no opportunity of examining whether the estuary of this river  was navigable or not; from its size however I should be inclined to the  affirmative. The other principal streams which drain this district are  the Buller, and the Murchison.    One remarkable feature in the province of Victoria is that the  carboniferous series is here developed throughout a tract of Western  Australia extending in latitude from the bottom of Geographe Bay to near  Cape Cuvier, and which I have carefully examined. The tract above alluded  to is the only one in which I have yet found the rocks belonging to this  series: this circumstance therefore imparts a very high degree of  interest to the district in question.    Within a few weeks after my return from the province of Victoria  applications from settlers were made to the Government of Western  Australia to permit them to occupy a district which had been so highly  spoken of; this application was however unsuccessful, but an expedition  was subsequently sent there to ascertain if there was a navigable  entrance to the Hutt River. In this object the expedition was  unsuccessful, but the vessel touched at the Abrolhos Islands and at some  parts of the adjacent coast, including Port Grey.*    (*Footnote. See above. [The coast to the eastward of the Abrolhos has  been since examined by H.M.'s surveying vessel the Beagle, Captain  Wickham, R.N., and while these sheets were passing through the press an  account of the survey of Port Grey, under the appellation of Champion  Bay, appeared in the Nautical Magazine for July 1841 page 443, from which  periodical it has been copied into Appendix B at the end of this volume.  ED.])    MR. MOORE'S JOURNAL. MR. MOORE'S VOYAGE TO HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS AND PORT  GREY.    An account of some of the places visited was subsequently published in  the Perth Gazette, being contained in extracts from the journal of G.F.  Moore, Esquire, the Queen's Advocate at Perth, who sailed with the  expedition; and as Mr. Moore's description contains several points of  novelty and interest these extracts are again transcribed below.    EXPEDITION TO THE NORTHWARD.    After Captain Grey had the misfortune to have his boats wrecked in  Gantheaume Bay, having started thence with his party and walked to Perth,  he reported that he had passed over extensive tracts of fertile country  in the neighbourhood of Moresby's Flat-topped Range, where there are  several rivers, one of which (the largest) he had called the Hutt River,  after His Excellency the Governor. His Excellency having directed the  Champion schooner to proceed to explore the coast with a view to  ascertain whether there was any practicable entrance to the river, and  whether there was any harbour, shelter, or anchorage in that  neighbourhood, also what sort of anchorage there was about the Houtman's  Abrolhos, it appeared very desirable that such an opportunity should be  taken advantage of to obtain, at the same time, as much information as  circumstances would permit as to the nature and quality of the soil and  its general capabilities with reference to its eligibility as a district  to be occupied by settlers. With this view G.F. Moore, Esquire, embarked  on the trip.    DESCRIPTION OF THE ABROLHOS ISLANDS.    The Abrolhos. Latitude by a good sight on shore, 288 degrees 45 minutes,  subsequently corrected to 288 degrees 40 minutes.    That part of the Abrolhos where we anchored seems to consist of a number  of small islets, perhaps 10 or 12, lying something in the form of an  irregularly shaped horse's shoe, extending for a space of perhaps 20  miles in a north and south direction.    These islets, which are raised only from 10 to 12 feet above the level of  the sea, are a mere mass of coral and shells with a very small variety of  plants struggling to establish themselves upon some of them. I was rather  surprised to find a few plants of the common groundsel on one of the  barest. It is not improbable that these islets are upon the outer rim of  the crater of a volcano, and that not only the entire outer rim, but also  a large space, both interior and exterior, will eventually be elevated.  Nothing can exceed the beauty of the different sorts of coral as seen  under the clear smooth water. We broke of many specimens of the branch-  or tree-coral, which seemed to be in full vigour of life and activity.  These islets appear to be a favourite resort of seals, many of which we  saw, but of the sort called hair-seals. The sailors knocked many of them  upon the head with clubs as they lay sleeping on the shores. One of these  afforded much sport, though rather of a barbarous sort if one had taken  time to think at all on the subject. Sleeping on the brink of a small  lagoon in the interior of one of these islands, he was roused by the  approaching footsteps of his enemy. Seeing the man close to him, with  upraised club over his head, he dropped into the water. This was so  shallow as not to protect him from the stones that were hurled at him  from all sides, and so small that he was completely surrounded. Finding  his retreat cut off he boldly stood up and seemed deliberately to scan  the most practicable mode of breaking his way through us all, but he was  so incessantly plied with stones as entirely to distract him. When a  well-aimed blow struck him he wreaked his vengeance on the stone, and,  diving after it to the bottom, gnashed upon it with his teeth. At last a  gun was brought by one of the party and a well-directed shot under the  ear laid him dead. Rock oysters of a large size and delicious flavour  were found in great abundance. Range of thermometer 67 to 82 degrees.    On Sunday the 12th continued to explore the several islands; unable to  land upon the first we approached on account of a reef which ran all  round it. This was one which lay at the north-east extremity of the  Horseshoe. It was high and sandy, but with some vegetation on the  surface, and we saw many large seals sleeping on the sandy beach. After  this, visited five or six in succession, all of the same formation, some  being mere masses of loose coral and dead shells.    SINGULAR CORAL FORMATIONS.    In passing from island to island we had many opportunities of observing  the different formation and shape of several species of coral; some stood  in masses of the brain-stone and cockscomb coral, some like petrified  sponge, some like fans, some again of the branch-coral interlaced and  intertwined in every direction; again, some broad flat masses lying layer  over layer, like huge sea-lichens, again many presented the appearance of  a fungus or great sea-mushroom, with a broad-spreading head springing  from a small thick base. It is not a little singular that many of the  growing islets which are nearly level with the surface of the water have  a similar form, not rising from the bottom with a perpendicular side, but  with broad overhanging heads resting upon a small base. In many places we  passed over some of these isolated sea-mushrooms, upon which there was  barely water for a small boat, where one step over the ledge would be in  the deep sea, and you might see the hollows underneath as if looking  under an umbrella. Birds were abundant on most of the isles, and on two  of them were hawks' nests, raised to the height of four feet by an  accumulation of sticks, stones, and shells. This day there was but little  breeze; the thermometer ranged from 76 to 86 degrees.    COAST UNDER THE MENAI HILLS.    Saturday morning January 25.    Stood in close along the shore opposite to the Table Hill and the Menai  Hills, and examined the coast from the rigging. There are two openings of  rivers laid down in the chart, that to the south being the larger, and  both nearly abreast of Table Hill and only a few miles distant from one  another; and besides these Captain Grey had marked down in another chart  a considerable river, with a large estuary, close to the north of the  Menai Hills, which he"]]]
