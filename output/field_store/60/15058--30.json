If they repel the advance of Napoleon,  they will oblige him to seek an alliance with Russia, and this was a  danger which even in those days Bismarck never ceased to fear. Prince  Napoleon, cousin of the Emperor, was at that time on a visit to Berlin;  on his way through Frankfort he had singled out Bismarck, and (no doubt  under instructions) had shown great friendliness to him; the _Kreuz  Zeitung_ again took the opportunity of insulting the ruler of France;  Bismarck again remonstrated against the danger of provoking hostility by  these acts of petty rancour, disguised though they might be under the  name of principle. He did not succeed in persuading the King or his  confidant; he was always met by the same answer: \"France is the natural  enemy of Germany; Napoleon is the representative of the Revolution;  there can be no union between the King of Prussia and the Revolution.\"  \"How can a man of your intelligence sacrifice your principles to a  single individual?\" asks Gerlach, who aimed not at shewing that an  alliance with France would be foolish, but that it would be wrong. Five  years before, Bismarck would have spoken as Gerlach did; but in these  years he had seen and learnt much; he had freed himself from the  influence of his early friends; he had outgrown their theoretic  formalism; he had learned to look at the world with his own eyes, and to  him, defending his country against the intrigues of weaker and the  pressure of more powerful States, the world was a different place from  what it was to those who passed their time in the shadow of the Court.  He remembered that it was not by strict obedience to general principles  that Prussia had grown great. Frederick the Second had not allowed  himself to be stopped by these narrow searchings of heart; his successor  had not scrupled to ally himself with revolutionary France. This rigid  insistence on a rule of right, this nice determining of questions of  conscience, seemed better suited to the confessor's chair than to the  advisers of a great monarch. And the principle to which he was asked to  sacrifice the future of his country,--was it after all a true principle?  Why should Prussia trouble herself about the internal constitution of  other States, what did it concern her whether France was ruled by a  Bourbon or an Orleans or a Bonaparte? How could Prussia continue the  policy of the Holy Alliance when the close union of the three Eastern  monarchies no longer existed? If France were to attack Germany, Prussia  could not expect the support of Russia, she could not even be sure of  that of Austria. An understanding with France was required, not by  ambition, but by the simplest grounds of self-preservation.    These and other considerations he advanced in a long and elaborate  memorandum addressed to Manteuffel, which was supplemented by letters to  the Minister and Gerlach. For closeness of reasoning, for clearness of  expression, for the wealth of knowledge and cogency of argument these  are the most remarkable of his political writings. In them he sums up  the results of his apprenticeship to political life, he lays down the  principles on which the policy of the State ought to be conducted, the  principles on which in future years he was himself to act.    \"What,\" he asks, \"are the reasons against an alliance with France? The  chief ground is the belief that the Emperor is the chief representative  of the Revolution and identical with it, and that a compromise with the  Revolution is as inadmissible in internal as in external policy.\" Both  statements he triumphantly overthrows. \"Why should we look at Napoleon  as the representative of the Revolution? there is scarcely a government  in Europe which has not a revolutionary origin.\"      \"What is there now existing in the world of politics which has a    complete legal basis? Spain, Portugal, Brazil, all the American    Republics, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Greece, Sweden,    England, which State with full consciousness is based on the    Revolution of 1688, are all unable to trace back their legal    systems to a legitimate origin. Even as to the German princes we    cannot find any completely legitimate title for the ground which    they have won partly from the Emperor and the Empire, partly from    their fellow-princes, partly from the Estates.\"    He goes farther: the Revolution is not peculiar to France; it did not  even originate there:      \"It is much older than the historical appearance of Napoleon's    family and far wider in its extent than France, if we are to    assign it an origin in this world, we must look for it, not in    France, but in England, or go back even earlier, even to Germany    or Rome, according as we regard the exaggerations of the    Reformation or of the Roman Church as responsible.\"    But if Napoleon is not the sole representative of revolutions, why make  opposition to him a matter of principle? He shews no desire of  propagandism.      \"To threaten other States by means of the Revolution has been for    years the trade of England, and this principle of not associating    with a revolutionary power is itself quite modern: it is not to    be found in the last century. Cromwell was addressed as Brother    by European potentates and they sought his friendship when it    appeared useful. The most honourable Princes joined in alliance    with the States-General before they were recognised by Spain. Why    should Prussia now alone, to its own injury, adopt this excessive    caution?\"    He goes farther: not only does he reject the principle of  legitimacy,--he refuses to be bound by any principles; he did not free  himself from one party to bind himself to another; his profession was  diplomacy and in diplomacy there was no place for feelings of affection  and antipathy.    What is the proper use of principles in diplomacy? It is to persuade  others to adopt a policy which is convenient to oneself.      \"My attitude towards Foreign Governments springs not from any    antipathy, but from the good or evil they may do to Prussia.\" \"A    policy of sentiment is dangerous, for it is one-sided; it is an    exclusively Prussian peculiarity.\" \"Every other Government makes    its own interests the sole criterion of its actions, however much    it may drape them in phrases about justice and sympathy.\" \"My    ideal for foreign policy is freedom from prejudice; that our    decisions should be independent of all impressions of dislike or    affection for Foreign States and their governments.\"    This was the canon by which he directed his own actions, and he expected  obedience to it from others.      \"So far as foreigners go I have never in my life had sympathy for    anyone but England and its inhabitants, and I am even now not    free from it; but they will not let us love them, and as soon as    it was proved to me that it was in the interest of a sound and    well-matured Prussian policy, I would let our troops fire on    French, English, Russian, or Austrian, with the same    satisfaction.\"      \"I cannot justify sympathies and antipathies as regards Foreign    Powers and persons before my feeling of duty in the foreign    service of my country, either in myself or another; therein lies    the embryo of disloyalty against my master or my country. In my    opinion not even the King himself has the right to subordinate    the interests of his country to his own feelings of love or    hatred towards strangers; he is, however, responsible towards God    and not to me if he does so, and therefore on this point I am    silent.\"    This reference to the King is very characteristic. Holding, as he did,  so high an ideal of public duty himself, he naturally regarded with  great dislike the influence which, too often, family ties and domestic  affection exercised over the mind of the sovereign. The German Princes  had so long pursued a purely domestic policy that they forgot to  distinguish between the interests of their families and their land. They  were, moreover, naturally much influenced in their public decisions, not  only by their personal sympathies, but also by the sympathies and  opinions of their nearest relations. To a man like Bismarck, who  regarded duty to the State as above everything, nothing could be more  disagreeable than to see the plans of professional statesmen criticised  by irresponsible people and perhaps overthrown through some woman's  whim. He was a confirmed monarchist but he was no courtier. In his  letters at this period he sometimes refers to the strong influence which  the Princess of Prussia exercised over her husband, who was heir to the  throne. He regarded with apprehension the possible effects which the  proposed marriage of the Prince of Prussia's son to the Princess Royal  of England might have on Prussian policy. He feared it would introduced  English influence and Anglomania without their gaining any similar  influence in England. \"If our future Queen remains in any degree  English, I see our Court surrounded by English influence.\" He was not  influenced in this by any hostility to England; almost at the same time  he had written that England was the only foreign country for which he  had any sympathy. He was only (as so often) contending for that  independence and self-reliance which he so admired in the English. For  two hundred years English traditions had absolutely forbidden the  sovereign to allow his personal and family sympathies to interfere with  the interests of the country. If the House of Hohenzollern were to  aspire to the position of a national monarch it must act in the same  way. At this very time the Emperor Napoleon was discussing the Prussian  marriage with Lord Clarendon. \"It will much influence the policy of the  Queen in favour of Prussia,\" he said. \"No, your Majesty,\" answered the  English Ambassador. \"The private feelings of the Queen can never have  any influence on that which she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#20)"],[1,"  received the intelligence that he was to go down to Alabama with his new  owner the next day, leaving father, mother, wife, and children behind. You  will not wonder that the man required a little judicious soothing under  such circumstances, and you will also, I hope, admire the humanity of the  sale of his wife and children by the owner who was going to take him to  Alabama, because _they_ would be incumbrances rather than otherwise down  there. If Mr. K---- did not do this after he knew that the man was his,  then Mr. ---- gave him to be carried down to the South after his wife and  children were sold to remain in Georgia. I do not know which was the real  transaction, for I have not had the heart to ask; but you will easily  imagine which of the two cases I prefer believing.    When I saw Mr. ---- after this most wretched story became known to me in  all its details, I appealed to him for his own soul's sake not to commit  so great a cruelty. Poor Joe's agony while remonstrating with his master  was hardly greater than mine while arguing with him upon this bitter  piece of inhumanity--how I cried, and how I adjured, and how all my sense  of justice and of mercy and of pity for the poor wretch, and of  wretchedness at finding myself implicated in such a state of things,  broke in torrents of words from my lips and tears from my eyes! God knows  such a sorrow at seeing anyone I belonged to commit such an act was  indeed a new and terrible experience to me, and it seemed to me that I  was imploring Mr. ---- to save himself, more than to spare these  wretches. He gave me no answer whatever, and I have since thought that  the intemperate vehemence of my entreaties and expostulations perhaps  deserved that he should leave me as he did without one single word of  reply; and miserable enough I remained. Towards evening, as I was sitting  alone, my children having gone to bed, Mr. O---- came into the room. I  had but one subject in my mind; I had not been able to eat for it. I  could hardly sit still for the nervous distress which every thought of  these poor people filled me with. As he sat down looking over some  accounts, I said to him, 'Have you seen Joe this afternoon, Mr. O----?'  (I give you our conversation as it took place.) 'Yes, ma'am; he is a  great deal happier than he was this morning.' 'Why, how is that?' asked I  eagerly. 'Oh, he is not going to Alabama. Mr. K---- heard that he had  kicked up a fuss about it (being in despair at being torn from one's wife  and children is called _kicking up a fuss_; this is a sample of overseer  appreciation of human feelings), and said that if the fellow wasn't  willing to go with him, he did not wish to be bothered with any niggers  down there who were to be troublesome, so he might stay behind.' 'And  does Psyche know this?' 'Yes, ma'am, I suppose so.' I drew a long breath;  and whereas my needle had stumbled through the stuff I was sewing for an  hour before, as if my fingers could not guide it, the regularity and  rapidity of its evolutions were now quite edifying. The man was for the  present safe, and I remained silently pondering his deliverance and the  whole proceeding, and the conduct of everyone engaged in it, and above  all Mr. ----'s share in the transaction, and I think for the first time  almost a sense of horrible personal responsibility and implication took  hold of my mind, and I felt the weight of an unimagined guilt upon my  conscience; and yet God knows this feeling of self-condemnation is very  gratuitous on my part, since when I married Mr. ---- I knew nothing of  these dreadful possessions of his, and even if I had, I should have been  much puzzled to have formed any idea of the state of things in which I  now find myself plunged, together with those whose well-doing is as vital  to me almost as my own.    With these agreeable reflections I went to bed. Mr. ---- said not a word  to me upon the subject of these poor people all the next day, and in the  meantime I became very impatient of this reserve on his part, because I  was dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her  children, and so prevent any future separation between her and her  husband, as I supposed he would not again attempt to make a present of  Joe, at least to anyone who did not wish to be _bothered_ with his wife  and children. In the evening I was again with Mr. O---- alone in the  strange bare wooden-walled sort of shanty which is our sitting-room, and  revolving in my mind the means of rescuing Psyche from her miserable  suspense, a long chain of all my possessions, in the shape of bracelets,  necklaces, brooches, ear-rings, &c., wound in glittering procession  through my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of  each separate ornament, and the very doubtful probability of the amount  of the whole being equal to the price of this poor creature and her  children; and then the great power and privilege I had foregone of  earning money by my own labour occurred to me; and I think, for the first  time in my life, my past profession assumed an aspect that arrested my  thoughts most seriously. For the last four years of my life that preceded  my marriage, I literally coined money; and never until this moment, I  think, did I reflect on the great means of good, to myself and others,  that I so gladly agreed to give up for ever, for a maintenance by the  unpaid labour of slaves--people toiling not only unpaid, but under the  bitter conditions the bare contemplation of which was then wringing my  heart. You will not wonder that, when in the midst of such cogitations I  suddenly accosted Mr. O----, it was to this effect. 'Mr. O----, I have a  particular favour to beg of you. Promise me that you will never sell  Psyche and her children without first letting me know of your intention  to do so, and giving me the option of buying them.' Mr. O---- is a  remarkably deliberate man, and squints, so that, when he has taken a  little time in directing his eyes to you, you are still unpleasantly  unaware of any result in which you are concerned; he laid down a book he  was reading, and directed his head and one of his eyes towards me and  answered, 'Dear me, ma'am, I am very sorry--I have sold them.' My work  fell down on the ground, and my mouth opened wide, but I could utter no  sound, I was so dismayed and surprised; and he deliberately proceeded: 'I  didn't know, ma'am, you see, at all, that you entertained any idea of  making an investment of that nature; for I'm sure, if I had, I would  willingly have sold the woman to you; but I sold her and her children  this morning to Mr. ----.' My dear E----, though ---- had resented my  unmeasured upbraidings, you see they had not been without some good  effect, and though he had, perhaps justly, punished my violent outbreak  of indignation about the miserable scene I witnessed by not telling me of  his humane purpose, he had bought these poor creatures, and so, I trust,  secured them from any such misery in future. I jumped up and left Mr.  O---- still speaking, and ran to find Mr. ----, to thank him for what he  had done, and with that will now bid you good bye. Think, E----, how it  fares with slaves on plantations where there is no crazy Englishwoman to  weep and entreat and implore and upbraid for them, and no master willing  to listen to such appeals.      Dear E----. There is one privilege which I enjoy here which I think few  cockneyesses have ever had experience of, that of hearing my own  extemporaneous praises chaunted bard-fashion by our negroes, in rhymes as  rude and to measures as simple as ever any illustrious female of the days  of King Brian Boroihme listened to. Rowing yesterday evening through a  beautiful sunset into a more beautiful moonrise, my two sable boatmen  entertained themselves and me with alternate strophe and anti-strophe of  poetical description of my personal attractions, in which my 'wire waist'  recurred repeatedly, to my intense amusement. This is a charm for the  possession of which M---- (my white nursemaid) is also invariably  celebrated; and I suppose that the fine round natural proportions of the  uncompressed waists of the sable beauties of these regions appear less  symmetrical to eyes accustomed to them than our stay-cased figures, since  'nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.' Occasionally I am celebrated in  these rowing chants as 'Massa's darling,' and S---- comes in for endless  glorification on account of the brilliant beauty of her complexion; the  other day, however, our poets made a diversion from the personal to the  moral qualities of their small mistress, and after the usual tribute to  her roses and lilies came the following rather significant couplet:--        Little Missis Sally,      That's a ruling lady.    At which all the white teeth simultaneously lightened from the black  visages, while the subject of this equivocal commendation sat with  infantine solemnity (the profoundest, I think, that the human countenance  is capable of), surveying her sable dependants with imperturbable gravity.    Yesterday morning I amused myself with an exercise of a talent I once  possessed, but have so neglected that my performance might almost be  called an experiment. I cut out a dress for one of the women. My education  in France--where, in some important respects, I think girls are better  trained than with us--had sent me home to England, at sixteen, an adept in  the female mystery of needlework. Not only owing to the Saturday's  discipline of clothes mending by all the classes--while l'Abbe Millot's  history (of blessed, boring memory) was being read aloud, to prevent 'vain  babblings,' and ensure wholesome mental occupation the while--was I an  expert patcher and mender, darner and piecer (darning and marking were my  specialities), but the white cotton embroidery of which every French woman  has always a piece under her hand _pour les momens perdus_,"]]]
