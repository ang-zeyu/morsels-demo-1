A system  in the sutras is weak and shapeless as a newborn babe, but if  we take it along with its developments down to the beginning  of the seventeenth century it appears as a fully developed man  strong and harmonious in all its limbs. It is therefore not possible  to write any history of successive philosophies of India, but it is  necessity that each system should be studied and interpreted in  all the growth it has acquired through the successive ages of  history from its conflicts with the rival systems as one whole [Footnote  ref 1]. In the history of Indian philosophy we have no place for systems  which had their importance only so long as they lived and were  then forgotten or remembered only as targets of criticism. Each  system grew and developed by the untiring energy of its adherents  through all the successive ages of history, and a history of this  growth is a history of its conflicts. No study of any Indian system  is therefore adequate unless it is taken throughout all the growth  it attained by the work of its champions, the commentators whose  selfless toil for it had kept it living through the ages of history.    ______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: In the case of some systems it is indeed possible to suggest  one or two earlier phases of the system, but this principle cannot be  carried all through, for the supplementary information and arguments  given by the later commentators often appear as harmonious elaborations  of the earlier writings and are very seldom in conflict with them.]    65      Growth of the Philosophic Literature.    It is difficult to say how the systems were originally formulated,  and what were the influences that led to it. We know that a  spirit of philosophic enquiry had already begun in the days of the  earliest Upani@sads. The spirit of that enquiry was that the final  essence or truth was the atman, that a search after it was our  highest duty, and that until we are ultimately merged in it we  can only feel this truth and remain uncontented with everything  else and say that it is not the truth we want, it is not the truth we  want (_neti neti_). Philosophical enquires were however continuing  in circles other than those of the Upani@sads. Thus the Buddha  who closely followed the early Upani@sad period, spoke of and enumerated  sixty-two kinds of heresies [Footnote ref 1], and these can hardly be  traced in the Upani@sads. The Jaina activities were also probably  going on contemporaneously but in the Upani@sads no reference  to these can be found. We may thus reasonably suppose that there  were different forms of philosophic enquiry in spheres other than  those of the Upani@sad sages, of which we have but scanty records.  It seems probable that the Hindu systems of thought originated  among the sages who though attached chiefly to the Upani@sad  circles used to take note of the discussions and views of the antagonistic  and heretical philosophic circles. In the assemblies of these  sages and their pupils, the views of the heretical circles were probably  discussed and refuted. So it continued probably for some time  when some illustrious member of the assembly such as Gautama  or Kanada collected the purport of these discussions on various  topics and problems, filled up many of the missing links, classified  and arranged these in the form of a system of philosophy and  recorded it in sutras. These sutras were intended probably for  people who had attended the elaborate oral discussions and thus  could easily follow the meaning of the suggestive phrases contained  in the aphorisms. The sutras thus contain sometimes  allusions to the views of the rival schools and indicate the way in  which they could be refuted. The commentators were possessed  of the general drift of the different discussions alluded to and  conveyed from generation to generation through an unbroken  chain of succession of teachers and pupils. They were however  free to supplement these traditionary explanations with their own    __________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: _Brahmajala-sutta, Digha_, 1. p. 12 ff.]    66    views or to modify and even suppress such of the traditionary  views with which they did not agree or which they found it difficult  to maintain. Brilliant oppositions from the opposing schools  often made it necessary for them to offer solutions to new problems  unthought of before, but put forward by some illustrious adherent  of a rival school. In order to reconcile these new solutions with  the other parts of the system, the commentators never hesitated to  offer such slight modifications of the doctrines as could harmonize  them into a complete whole. These elaborations or modifications  generally developed the traditionary system, but did not effect any  serious change in the system as expounded by the older teachers,  for the new exponents always bound themselves to the explanations  of the older teachers and never contradicted them. They  would only interpret them to suit their own ideas, or say new things  only in those cases where the older teachers had remained silent.  It is not therefore possible to describe the growth of any system  by treating the contributions of the individual commentators separately.  This would only mean unnecessary repetition. Except  when there is a specially new development, the system is to be  interpreted on the basis of the joint work of the commentators  treating their contributions as forming one whole.    The fact that each system had to contend with other rival  systems in order to hold its own has left its permanent mark  upon all the philosophic literatures of India which are always  written in the form of disputes, where the writer is supposed to  be always faced with objections from rival schools to whatever  he has got to say. At each step he supposes certain objections  put forth against him which he answers, and points out the defects  of the objector or shows that the objection itself is ill founded. It  is thus through interminable byways of objections, counter-objections  and their answers that the writer can wend his way to his  destination. Most often the objections of the rival schools are  referred to in so brief a manner that those only who know the  views can catch them. To add to these difficulties the Sanskrit  style of most of the commentaries is so condensed and different  from literary Sanskrit, and aims so much at precision and brevity,  leading to the use of technical words current in the diverse systems,  that a study of these becomes often impossible without the aid  of an expert preceptor; it is difficult therefore for all who are not  widely read in all the different systems to follow any advanced    67    work of any particular system, as the deliberations of that particular  system are expressed in such close interconnection with  the views of other systems that these can hardly be understood  without them. Each system of India has grown (at least in  particular epochs) in relation to and in opposition to the growth  of other systems of thought, and to be a thorough student of Indian  philosophy one should study all the systems in their mutual  opposition and relation from the earliest times to a period at  which they ceased to grow and came to a stop--a purpose for  which a work like the present one may only be regarded as  forming a preliminary introduction.    Besides the sutras and their commentaries there are also independent  treatises on the systems in verse called _karikas_, which  try to summarize the important topics of any system in a succinct  manner; the _Sa@mkhya karika_ may be mentioned as a work of this  kind. In addition to these there were also long dissertations,  commentaries, or general observations on any system written in  verses called the varttikas; the _S'lokavarttika_, of Kumarila or the  _Varttika_ of Sures'vara may be mentioned as examples. All these  of course had their commentaries to explain them. In addition  to these there were also advanced treatises on the systems in prose  in which the writers either nominally followed some selected  sutras or proceeded independently of them. Of the former class  the _Nyayamanjari_ of Jayanta may be mentioned as an example  and of the latter the _Pras'astapada bha@sya_, the _Advaitasiddhi_ of  Madhusudana Sarasvati or the _Vedanta-paribha@sa_ of Dharmarajadhvarindra.  The more remarkable of these treatises were of a masterly nature in  which the writers represented the systems they adhered to in a highly  forcible and logical manner by dint of their own great mental powers  and genius. These also had their commentaries to explain and elaborate  them. The period of the growth of the philosophic literatures of India  begins from about 500 B.C. (about the time of the Buddha) and practically  ends in the later half of the seventeenth century, though even now some  minor publications are seen to come out.      The Indian Systems of Philosophy.    The Hindus classify the systems of philosophy into two classes,  namely, the _nastika_ and the _astika_. The nastika (_na asti_ \"it is  not\") views are those which neither regard the Vedas as infallible    68    nor try to establish their own validity on their authority. These are  principally three in number, the Buddhist, Jaina and the Carvaka.  The astika-mata or orthodox schools are six in number, Sa@mkhya,  Yoga, Vedanta, Mima@msa, Nyaya and Vais'e@sika, generally known  as the six systems (_@sa@ddars'ana_ [Footnote ref 1]).    The Sa@mkhya is ascribed to a mythical Kapila, but the  earliest works on the subject are probably now lost. The Yoga  system is attributed to Patanjali and the original sutras are called  the _Patanjala Yoga sutras_.

And that's not  what you're doin' by me. I ask your pardon if I say what I have a right  to say in language not as good as I'd like to talk to yu' with. But at  South Fork Crossin' who did any introducin'? Did yu' complain I was a  stranger then?\"    \"I--no!\" she flashed out; then, quite sweetly, \"The driver told me it  wasn't REALLY so dangerous there, you know.\"    \"That's not the point I'm makin'. You are a grown-up woman, a  responsible woman. You've come ever so far, and all alone, to a  rough country to instruct young children that play games,--tag, and  hide-and-seek, and fooleries they'll have to quit when they get old.  Don't you think pretendin' yu' don't know a man,--his name's nothin',  but him,--a man whom you were glad enough to let assist yu' when  somebody was needed,--don't you think that's mighty close to  hide-and-seek them children plays? I ain't so sure but what there's a  pair of us children in this hyeh room.\"    Molly Wood was regarding him saucily. \"I don't think I like you,\" said  she.    \"That's all square enough. You're goin' to love me before we get  through. I wish yu'd come a-ridin, ma'am.\"    \"Dear, dear, dear! So I'm going to love you? How will you do it? I know  men think that they only need to sit and look strong and make chests at  a girl--\"    \"Goodness gracious! I ain't makin' any chests at yu'!\" Laughter overcame  him for a moment, and Miss Wood liked his laugh very much. \"Please come  a-ridin',\" he urged. \"It's the prettiest kind of a day.\"    She looked at him frankly, and there was a pause. \"I will take back two  things that I said to you,\" she then answered him. \"I believe that I do  like you. And I know that if I went riding with you, I should not  have an immature protector.\" And then, with a final gesture of  acknowledgment, she held out her hand to him. \"And I have always  wanted,\" she said, \"to thank you for what you did at the river.\"    He took her hand, and his heart bounded. \"You're a gentleman!\" he  exclaimed.    It was now her turn to be overcome with merriment. \"I've always wanted  to be a man,\" she said.    \"I am mighty glad you ain't,\" said he, looking at her.    But Molly had already received enough broadsides for one day. She could  allow no more of them, and she took herself capably in hand. \"Where did  you learn to make such pretty speeches?\" she asked. \"Well, never mind  that. One sees that you have had plenty of practice for one so young.\"    \"I am twenty-seven,\" blurted the Virginian, and knew instantly that he  had spoken like a fool.    \"Who would have dreamed it!\" said Molly, with well-measured mockery. She  knew that she had scored at last, and that this day was hers. \"Don't  be too sure you are glad I'm not a man,\" she now told him. There was  something like a challenge in her voice.    \"I risk it,\" he remarked.    \"For I am almost twenty-three myself,\" she concluded. And she gave him a  look on her own account.    \"And you'll not come a-ridin'?\" he persisted.    \"No,\" she answered him; \"no.\" And he knew that he could not make her.    \"Then I will tell yu' good-by,\" said he. \"But I am comin' again. And  next time I'll have along a gentle hawss for yu'.\"    \"Next time! Next time! Well, perhaps I will go with you. Do you live  far?\"    \"I live on Judge Henry's ranch, over yondeh.\" He pointed across the  mountains. \"It's on Sunk Creek. A pretty rough trail; but I can come  hyeh to see you in a day, I reckon. Well, I hope you'll cert'nly enjoy  good health, ma'am.\"    \"Oh, there's one thing!\" said Molly Wood, calling after him rather  quickly. \"I--I'm not at all afraid of horses. You needn't bring such  a gentle one. I--was very tired that day, and--and I don't scream as a  rule.\"    He turned and looked at her so that she could not meet his glance.  \"Bless your heart!\" said he. \"Will yu' give me one o' those flowers?\"    \"Oh, certainly! I'm always so glad when people like them.\"    \"They're pretty near the color of your eyes.\"    \"Never mind my eyes.\"    \"Can't help it, ma'am. Not since South Fork.\"    He put the flower in the leather band of his hat, and rode away on his  Monte horse. Miss Wood lingered a moment, then made some steps toward  her gate, from which he could still be seen; and then, with something  like a toss of the head, she went in and shut her door.    Later in the day the Virginian met Mr. McLean, who looked at his hat and  innocently quoted, \"'My Looloo picked a daisy.'\"    \"Don't yu', Lin,\" said the Southerner.    \"Then I won't,\" said Lin.    Thus, for this occasion, did the Virginian part from his lady--and  nothing said one way or another about the handkerchief that had  disappeared during the South Fork incident.    As we fall asleep at night, our thoughts will often ramble back and  forth between the two worlds.    \"What color were his eyes?\" wondered Molly on her pillow. \"His mustache  is not bristly like so many of them. Sam never gave me such a look  at Hoosic Junction. No.... You can't come with me.... Get off your  horse.... The passengers are all staring....\"    And while Molly was thus dreaming that the Virginian had ridden his  horse into the railroad car, and sat down beside her, the fire in the  great stone chimney of her cabin flickered quietly, its gleams now and  again touching the miniature of Grandmother Stark upon the wall.    Camped on the Sunk Creek trail, the Virginian was telling himself in his  blankets: \"I ain't too old for education. Maybe she will lend me books.  And I'll watch her ways and learn...stand still, Monte. I can learn a  lot more than the kids on that. There's Monte...you pie-biter, stop....  He has ate up your book, ma'am, but I'll get yu'...\"    And then the Virginian was fast asleep.          XII. QUALITY AND EQUALITY      To the circle at Bennington, a letter from Bear Creek was always a  welcome summons to gather and hear of doings very strange to Vermont.  And when the tale of the changed babies arrived duly by the post, it  created a more than usual sensation, and was read to a large number of  pleased and scandalized neighbors. \"I hate her to be where such things  can happen,\" said Mrs. Wood.    \"I wish I could have been there,\" said her son-in-law, Andrew Bell.    \"She does not mention who played the trick,\" said Mrs. Andrew Bell.    \"We shouldn't be any wiser if she did,\" said Mrs. Wood.    \"I'd like to meet the perpetrator,\" said Andrew.    \"Oh, no!\" said Mrs. Wood. \"They're all horrible.\"    And she wrote at once, begging her daughter to take good care of  herself, and to see as much of Mrs. Balaam as possible. \"And of any  other ladies that are near you. For you seem to me to be in a community  of roughs. I wish you would give it all up. Did you expect me to laugh  about the babies?\"    Mrs. Flynt, when this story was repeated to her (she had not been  invited in to hear the letter), remarked that she had always felt that  Molly Wood must be a little vulgar, ever since she began to go about  giving music lessons like any ordinary German.    But Mrs. Wood was considerably relieved when the next letter arrived. It  contained nothing horrible about barbecues or babies. It mentioned the  great beauty of the weather, and how well and strong the fine air was  making the writer feel. And it asked that books might be sent, many  books of all sorts, novels, poetry, all the good old books and any good  new ones that could be spared. Cheap editions, of course.    \"Indeed she shall have them!\" said Mrs. Wood. \"How her mind must be  starving in that dreadful place!\" The letter was not a long one, and,  besides the books, spoke of little else except the fine weather and  the chances for outdoor exercise that this gave. \"You have no idea,\"  it said, \"how delightful it is to ride, especially on a spirited horse,  which I can do now quite well.\"    \"How nice that is!\" said Mrs. Wood, putting down the letter. \"I hope the  horse is not too spirited.\"    \"Who does she go riding with?\" asked Mrs. Bell.    \"She doesn't say, Sarah. Why?\"    \"Nothing. She has a queer way of not mentioning things, now and then.\"    \"Sarah!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wood, reproachfully. \"Oh, well, mother, you  know just as well as I do that she can be very independent and  unconventional.\"    \"Yes; but not in that way. She wouldn't ride with poor Sam Bannett, and  after all he is a suitable person.\"    Nevertheless, in her next letter, Mrs. Wood cautioned her daughter about  trusting herself with any one of whom Mrs. Balaam did not thoroughly  approve. The good lady could never grasp that Mrs. Balaam lived a long  day's journey from Bear Creek, and that Molly saw her about once every  three months. \"We have sent your books,\" the mother wrote; \"everybody  has contributed from their store,--Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning,  Longfellow; and a number of novels by Scott, Thackeray, George Eliot,  Hawthorne, and lesser writers; some volumes of Emerson; and Jane Austen  complete, because you admire her so particularly.\"    This consignment of literature reached Bear Creek about a week before  Christmas time.    By New Year's Day, the Virginian had begun his education.    \"Well, I have managed to get through 'em,\" he said, as he entered  Molly's cabin in February. And he laid two volumes upon her table.    \"And what do you think of them?\" she inquired.    \"I think that I've cert'nly earned a good long ride to-day.\"    \"Georgie Taylor has sprained his ankle.\"    \"No, I don't mean that kind of a ride. I've earned a ride with just us  two alone. I've read every word of both of 'em, yu' know.\"    \"I'll think about it. Did you like them?\"    \"No. Not much. If I'd knowed that one was a detective story, I'd have  got yu' to try something else on me. Can you guess the murderer, or is  the author too smart for yu'? That's all they amount to. Well, he was  too smart for me this time,"]]]
