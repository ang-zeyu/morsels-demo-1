Anticipating a little, we may notice that the Viceroy of Audh, at  the very climax of his good fortune, met the only enemy whom  neither force can subdue nor policy deceive. Shujaa-ud-daulah  died in January, 1775; and as it was not possible for so  conspicuous a public character to pass away without exciting  popular notice, the following explanation of the affair was  circulated at the time; which, whether a fact or a fiction,  deserves to be mentioned as the sort of ending which was  considered in his case probable and appropriate. It was believed  that, the family of Rahmat Khan having fallen into his hands,  Shujaa-ud-daulah sent for one of the fallen chief's daughters,  and that the young lady, in the course of the interview, avenged  the death of her father by stabbing his conqueror with a poisoned  knife. \"Although,\" says the author of the Siar-ul-Mutakharin, who  is the authority for the story, \"there may be no foundation of  truth in this account, yet it was at the time as universally  believed as that God is our Refuge.\"    The editor of the Calcutta translation of 1789 asserts that he  had satisfactory proof of the truth of this story. The Viceroy  died of a cancer in the groin; and the women of his Zanana, who  were let out on the occasion, and with one of whom he (the  translator) was acquainted, had made a song upon the subject.  They gave full particulars of the affair, and stated that the  young lady  she was only seventeen  had been put to death on  the day the Viceroy received the wound. (S. U. M., III. 268.)    The death of the Viceroy-Vazir, however occasioned, was a serious  blow to the reduced Empire of Dehli, which was just then  beginning to enjoy a gleam of sunshine such as had not visited it  since the day when Mir Mannu and the eldest son of Mohammad Shah  defeated the Abdali, in 1743. Had the career of Shujaa-ud-daulah  been prolonged a few years, it is possible that his ambitious  energy, supported by British skill and valour, and kept within  bounds by Mirza Najaf Khan's loyal and upright character, would  have effectually strengthened the Empire against the Mahrattas,  and altered the whole subsequent course of Indian history.    But Shujaa's son and successor was a weak voluptuary, who never  left his own provinces; and although the Mirza, his deputy in the  Vazirship and real locum tenens, received for his lifetime the  reward of his merits, yet he was unable of himself to give a  permanent consolidation to the tottering fabric.    It has been seen that he was meditating a campaign against the  Jats, whom Zabita's recent fall had again thrown into discontent,  when summoned to Rohilkand, in 1774. In fact, he had already  wrested from them the fort of Agra, and occupied it with a  garrison of his own, under a Moghul officer, Mohammad Beg, of  Hamadan. Not daunted by this reverse, Ranjit Singh, the then  ruler of that bold tribe the Jats, advanced upon the capital, and  occupied Sikandrabad with 10,000 horse. The forces left in Dehli  consisted of but 5,000 horse and two battalions of sepoys; but  they sufficed to expel the intruder. He shortly afterwards,  however, returned, reinforced by the regulars and guns under  Sumroo; but by this time the Mirza was returned from Rohilkand,  and after the rains of 1774, marched against them, aided by a  chief from Hariana, named after himself Najaf Kuli Khan, who  brought into the field some 10,000 troops. This man, who was a  good soldier and a faithful follower of the minister, was a  converted Hindu, of the Rathur tribe; a native of the Bikanir  country bordering on Rajputana Proper to the south, and to the  north on Hariana and other states immediately surrounding the  metropolis. Having been in service at Allahabad, under the father  of Mohammad Kuli, the connection and early patron of the Mirza,  he became a Mohammadan under the sponsorship of the latter, and  ever after continued a member of his household. At the time of  which I write, he had been appointed to the charge of districts  returning twenty lakhs a year, with the title of Saif-ud-daulah.    The departure of the Mirza for this campaign was extremely  agreeable to the Diwan, Majad-ud-daulah, for he never lost an  opportunity of prejudicing the Emperor's mind against this  powerful rival, in whose recent appointment to the office of Naib  Vazir, moreover, he had found a special disappointment. Indeed,  Shah Alam, between these two ministers, was like the hero of  medi¾val legend between his good and evil angels; only differing  in this, that in his case the good influence was also, to a great  extent, the most powerful. What the wily Kashmirian might have  done in the way of supplanting the Mirza, if the latter had been  signally worsted, and he himself had been otherwise fortunate,  cannot now be certainly conjectured, for a fresh revolt of  Zabita's summoned the Diwan to the northward, whilst his rival  was successfully engaged with the Jats. In this expedition  Majad-ud-daulah displayed a great want of spirit and of skill, so  that Zabita became once more extremely formidable. Fortunately at  this crisis Dehli was visited by an envoy, soliciting investiture  for the new Viceroy of Audh, Asaf-ud-daulah. Accompanying the  embassy was a force of 5,000 good troops, with a train of  artillery, the whole under command of the deceased Shujaa's  favourite general, Latafat Khan. This timely reinforcement saved  the metropolis, and allowed of a settlement being made with the  incorrigible Zabita, which preserved, to some extent at least,  the dignity of the Government (Vide next chapter).    Meanwhile the Imperialists had found the Jats, under their  chieftain, intrenched near Hodal, a town sixty miles from Dehli,  on the Mathra road. Dislodged from this, they fell back a few  miles, and again took up a position in a fortified village called  Kotban, where the Mirza endeavoured to blockade them. After  amusing him with skirmishes for about a fortnight, they again  fell back on Dig, a stronghold, to become the scene of still more  important events a few years later. Dig  the name is perhaps a  corruption of some such word as Dirajgarh  is a strong fort,  with a beautiful palace and pleasure-grounds adjoining, on the  shores of an artificial lake, fed by the drainage of part of the  Alwar Highlands. Observing that the sallies of the Jats had  ceased, the Mirza left their camp at Dig in his rear, and marched  to Barsana, where a pitched battle was fought.    1775.  The van of the Imperialists was commanded by Najaf Kuli.  In the centre of the main line was the Mirza himself, with  battalions of sepoys and artillery, under officers trained by the  English in Bengal, on the two wings. In the rear was the Moghul  cavalry. The enemy's regular infantry  5,000 strong, and led by  Sumroo  advanced to the attack, covered by clouds of Jat  skirmishers, and supported by a heavy cannonade, to which the  Mirza's artillery briskly replied, but from which he lost several  of his best officers and himself received a wound. A momentary  confusion ensued; but the Mirza, fervently invoking the God of  Islam, presently charged the Jats at the head of the Moghul  horse, who were, it will be remembered, his personal followers.  Najaf Kuli, accompanied by the regular infantry, following at the  double, the Jats were broken; and the resistance of Sumroo's  battalions only sufficed to cover the rout of the rest of the  army, and preserve some appearance of order as he too retreated,  though in somewhat better order, towards Dig. An immense quantity  of plunder fell into the hands of the victors, who soon reduced  the open country, and closely invested the beaten army. Such,  however, was the store of grain in the Fort of Dig, that the  strictest blockade proved fruitless for a twelvemonth; nor was  the Fort finally reduced till the end of March, 1776, when the  garrison found means  not improbably by connivance  to escape  to the neighbouring castle of Kumbhair with portable property on  elephants. The rest of the Thakur's wealth was seized by the  victors  his silver plate, his stately equipages and  paraphernalia, and his military chest, containing six lakhs of  rupees  which may perhaps be regarded as not very inferior, in  relative value, to a quarter of a million sterling of our modern  money.    In the midst of these successes, and whilst he was occupied in  settling the conquered country, the Mirza received intelligence  from Court that Zabita Khan, emboldened by his easy triumph over  the Diwan, Majad-ud-daulah (Abdul Ahid Khan), had taken into his  pay a large body of Sikhs, with whom he was about to march upon  the metropolis.    The enterprising minister returned at once to Dehli, where he was  received with high outward honour. He was, on this occasion,  attended by the condottiere Sumroo, who, in his usual fashion,  had transferred his battalions to the strongest side soon after  the battle of Barsana. Sumroo's original patron, Mir Kasim, died  about the same time, in the neighbourhood of Dehli, where he had  settled, after years of skulking and misery, in the vain hope of  obtaining employment in the Imperial service. The date of his  death is given by Broome (Hist. of Beng. Army, p. 467) as 6th  dune, 1777: it is added that his last shawl was sold to pay for a  winding-sheet, and that his family were plundered of the last  wreck of their possessions. But the detail of this year's events  and their consequences requires a fresh chapter.        NOTEThe following is the text of the supplemental treaty of  1772, as given by Captain Hamilton. (The former portion having  provided in general terms for an alliance, offensive and  defensive.) \"The Vuzeer of the Empire shall establish the  Rohillas,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#20)"],[1,"man chooses to take slaves into a  Territory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.  This being so, and this decision being made, one of the points that the  Judge approved, and one in the approval of which he says he means to  keep me down,--_put_ me down I should not say, for I have never been up!  He says he is in favour of it, and sticks to it, and expects to win his  battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as  squatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a  Territory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it,  and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it. When that  is so, how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty, I  should like to know?    When we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make  a constitution. Kansas was settled, for example, in 1854. It was a  Territory yet, without having formed a constitution, in a very regular  way, for three years. All this time negro slavery could be taken in by  any few individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which  the Judge approves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but  when they come to make a constitution they may say they will not have  slavery. But it is there; they are obliged to tolerate it in some way,  and all experience shows it will be so,--for they will not take the  negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them. All experience  shows this to be so. All that space of time that runs from the beginning  of the settlement of the Territory until there is a sufficiency of  people to make a State constitution,--all that portion of time popular  sovereignty is given up. The seal is absolutely put down upon it by the  court decision, and Judge Douglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet  he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion  to popular sovereignty.    Again, when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a  State constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without  slavery,--if that is anything new I confess I don't know it. Has there  ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a  Territory itself should form a constitution? What is now in it that  Judge Douglas should have fought several years of his life, and pledge  himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for? Can Judge  Douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a  constitution for a people?... It is enough for my purpose to ask,  whenever a Republican said anything against it? They never said anything  against it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whosoever will  undertake to examine the platform and the speeches of responsible men of  the party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable  to find one word from anybody in the Republican ranks opposed to that  popular sovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks he has invented. I  suppose that Judge Douglas will claim in a little while that he is the  inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves; that  nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward. We do  not remember that in that old Declaration of Independence it is said  that \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable  rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among  men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" There  is the origin of popular sovereignty. Who, then, shall come in at this  day and claim that he invented it? The Lecompton constitution connects  itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the Lecompton  constitution that our friend Judge Douglas claims such vast credit. I  agree that in opposing the Lecompton constitution, so far as I can  perceive, he was right. I do not deny that at all; and, gentlemen, you  will readily see why I could not deny it, even if I wanted to. But I do  not wish to, for all the Republicans in the nation opposed it, and they  would have opposed it just as much without Judge Douglas's aid as with  it. They had all taken ground against it long before he did. Why, the  reason that he urges against that constitution I urged against him a  year before. I have the printed speech in my hand. The argument that he  makes why that constitution should not be adopted, that the people were  not fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out in a speech a  year ago, which I hold in my hand now, that no fair chance was to be  given to the people.    ... A little more now as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the  Lecompton constitution. The Lecompton constitution, as the Judge tells  us, was defeated. The defeat of it was a good thing, or it was not. He  thinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I; and we agree in  that. Who defeated it? [A voice: \"Judge Douglas.\"] Yes, he furnished  himself; and if you suppose he controlled the other Democrats that went  with him, he furnished three votes, while the Republicans furnished  twenty.    That is what he did to defeat it. In the House of Representatives he and  his friends furnished some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished  ninety odd. Now, who was it that did the work? [A voice: \"Douglas.\"]  Why, yes, Douglas did it? To be sure he did!    Let us, however, put that proposition another way. The Republicans could  not have done it without Judge Douglas. Could he have done it without  them? Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other?  Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did  it. The proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one.  [A voice: \"Why don't they come out on it?\"] You don't know what you are  talking about, my friend; I am quite willing to answer any gentleman in  the crowd who asks an intelligent question.    Now, who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of Judge  Douglas's way of thinking, and who have acted upon this main question,  that have ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull? I  defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic meeting. I  take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution, large  or small, of a Democratic meeting in favour of Judge Trumbull, or any of  the five to one Republicans who beat that bill. Everything must be for  the Democrats! They did everything, and the five to the one that really  did the thing, they snub over, and they do not seem to remember that  they have an existence upon the face of the earth.    Gentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious. I leave this branch of  the subject to take hold of another. I take up that part of Judge  Douglas's speech in which he respectfully attended to me.    Judge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech at Springfield. He  says they are to be the issues of this campaign. The first one of these  points he bases upon the language in a speech which I delivered at  Springfield, which I believe I can quote correctly from memory. I said  that \"we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted  for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end  to slavery agitation; under the operation of that policy, that agitation  has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. I believe it will  not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house  divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot  endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union  to be dissolved,\"--I am quoting from my speech,--\"I do not expect the  house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will  become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery  will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind  shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate  extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become  alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new; North as well as  South.\"    That is the paragraph! In this paragraph which I have quoted in your  hearing, and to which I ask the attention of all, Judge Douglas thinks  he discovers great political heresy. I want your attention particularly  to what he has inferred from it. He says I am in favour of making all  the States of this Union uniform in all their internal regulations; that  in all their domestic concerns I am in favour of making them entirely  uniform. He draws this inference from the language I have quoted to you.  He says that I am in favour of making war by the North upon the South  for the extinction of slavery; that I am also in favour of inviting (as  he expresses it) the South to a war upon the North for the purpose of  nationalizing slavery. Now, it is singular enough, if you will carefully  read that passage over, that I did not say that I was in favour of  anything in it. I only said what I expected would take place. I made a  prediction only,--it may have been a foolish one, perhaps. I did not  even say that I desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate  extinction. I do say so now, however; so there need be no longer any  difficulty about that. It may be written down in the great speech.    Gentlemen, Judge Douglas informed you that this speech of mine was  probably carefully prepared. I admit that it was. I am not master of  language; I have not a fine education; I am not capable of entering into  a disquisition upon dialectics, as I believe you call it; but I do not  believe the language I employed bears any such construction as Judge  Douglas puts upon it. But I don't care about a quibble in regard to  words. I know what I meant, and I will not leave this crowd in doubt,"]]]
