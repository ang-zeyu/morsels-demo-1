It deals with the reproductory part of our natures,      and must have a deep hereditary influence. It is a natural result      of the foolish false modesty shown regarding all sex instruction.      Every boy should be taught the simple physiological facts before      his life is forever blighted by this cause.\" Lancaster has had in      his hands one thousand letters, mostly written by young people,      who were usually normal, and addressed to quacks who were duping      them. From time to time the suicides of youths from this cause      are reported, and in many mysterious suicides this has      undoubtedly been the real cause. \"Week after week,\" writes the      _British Medical Journal_ in an editorial (\"Dangerous Quack      Literature: The Moral of a Recent Suicide,\" Oct. 1, 1892), \"we      receive despairing letters from those victims of foul birds of      prey who have obtained their first hold on those they rob,      torture and often ruin, by advertisements inserted by newspapers      of a respectable, nay, even of a valuable and respected,      character.\" It is added that the wealthy proprietors of such      newspapers, often enjoying a reputation for benevolence, even      when the matter is brought before them, refuse to interfere as      they would thereby lose a source of income, and a censorship of      advertisements is proposed. This, however, is difficult, and      would be quite unnecessary if youths received proper      enlightenment from their natural guardians.        Masturbation, and the fear that by an occasional and perhaps      outgrown practice of masturbation they have sometimes done      themselves irreparable injury, is a common source of anxiety to      boys. It has long been a question whether a boy should be warned      against masturbation. At a meeting of the Section of Psychology      of the British Medical Association some years ago, four speakers,      including the President (Dr. Blandford), were decidedly in favor      of parents warning their children against masturbation, while      three speakers were decidedly against that course, mainly on the      ground that it was possible to pass through even a public school      life without hearing of masturbation, and also that the warning      against masturbation might encourage the practice. It is,      however, becoming more and more clearly realized that ignorance,      even if it can be maintained, is a perilous possession, while the      teaching that consists, as it should, in a loving mother's      counsel to the child from his earliest years to treat his sexual      parts with care and respect, can only lead to masturbation in the      child who is already irresistibly impelled to it. Most of the sex      manuals for boys touch on masturbation, sometimes exaggerating      its dangers; such exaggeration should be avoided, for it leads to      far worse evils than those it attempts to prevent. It seems      undesirable that any warnings about masturbation should form part      of school instruction, unless under very special circumstances.      The sexual instruction imparted in the school on sexual as on      other subjects should be absolutely impersonal and objective.        At this point we approach one of the difficulties in the way of      sexual enlightenment: the ignorance or unwisdom of the would-be      teachers. This difficulty at present exists both in the home and      the school, while it destroys the value of many manuals written      for the sexual instruction of the young. The mother, who ought to      be the child's confidant and guide in matters of sexual      education, and could naturally be so if left to her own healthy      instincts, has usually been brought up in false traditions which      it requires a high degree of intelligence and character to escape      from; the school-teacher, even if only called upon to give      instruction in natural history, is oppressed by the same      traditions, and by false shame concerning the whole subject of      sex; the writer of manuals on sex has often only freed himself      from these bonds in order to advocate dogmatic, unscientific, and      sometimes mischievous opinions which have been evolved in entire      ignorance of the real facts. As Moll says (Das _Sexualleben des      Kindes_, p. 276), necessary as sexual enlightenment is, we cannot      help feeling a little skeptical as to its results so long as      those who ought to enlighten are themselves often in need of      enlightenment. He refers also to the fact that even among      competent authorities there is difference of opinion concerning      important matters, as, for instance, whether masturbation is      physiological at the first development of the sexual impulse and      how far sexual abstinence is beneficial. But it is evident that      the difficulties due to false tradition and ignorance will      diminish as sound traditions and better knowledge become more      widely diffused.    The girl at puberty is usually less keenly and definitely conscious of her  sexual nature than the boy. But the risks she runs from sexual ignorance,  though for the most part different, are more subtle and less easy to  repair. She is often extremely inquisitive concerning these matters; the  thoughts of adolescent girls, and often their conversation among  themselves, revolve much around sexual and allied mysteries. Even in the  matter of conscious sexual impulse the girl is often not so widely  different from her brother, nor so much less likely to escape the  contamination of evil communications, so that the scruples of foolish and  ignorant persons who dread to \"sully her purity\" by proper instruction are  exceedingly misplaced.        Conversations dealing with the important mysteries of human      nature, Obici and Marchesini were told by ladies who had formerly      been pupils in Italian Normal Schools, are the order of the day      in schools and colleges, and specially circle around procreation,      the most difficult mystery of all. In England, even in the best      and most modern colleges, in which games and physical exercise      are much cultivated, I am told that \"the majority of the girls      are entirely ignorant of all sexual matters, and understand      nothing whatever about them. But they do wonder about them, and      talk about them constantly\" (see Appendix D, \"The School      Friendships of Girls,\" in the second volume of these _Studies_).      \"The restricted life and fettered mind of girls,\" wrote a      well-known physician some years ago (J. Milner Fothergill,      _Adolescence_, 1880, pp. 20, 22) \"leave them with less to      actively occupy their thoughts than is the case with boys. They      are studiously taught concealment, and a girl may be a perfect      model of outward decorum and yet have a very filthy mind. The      prudishness with which she is brought up leaves her no      alternative but to view her passions from the nasty side of human      nature. All healthy thought on the subject is vigorously      repressed. Everything is done to darken her mind and foul her      imagination by throwing her back on her own thoughts and a      literature with which she is ashamed to own acquaintance. It is      opposed to a girl's best interests to prevent her from having      fair and just conceptions about herself and her nature. Many a      fair young girl is irredeemably ruined on the very threshold of      life, herself and her family disgraced, from ignorance as much as      from vice. When the moment of temptation comes she falls without      any palpable resistance; she has no trained educated power of      resistance within herself; her whole future hangs, not upon      herself, but upon the perfection of the social safeguards by      which she is hedged and surrounded.\" Under the free social order      of America to-day much the same results are found. In an      instructive article (\"Why Girls Go Wrong,\" _Ladies' Home      Journal_, Jan., 1907) B.B. Lindsey, who, as Judge of the Juvenile      Court of Denver, is able to speak with authority, brings forward      ample evidence on this head. Both girls and boys, he has found,      sometimes possess manuscript books in which they had written down      the crudest sexual things. These children were often sweet-faced,      pleasant, refined and intelligent, and they had respectable      parents; but no one had ever spoken to them of sex matters,      except the worst of their school-fellows or some coarse-minded      and reckless adult. By careful inquiry Lindsey found that only in      one in twenty cases had the parents ever spoken to the children      of sexual subjects. In nearly every case the children      acknowledged that it was not from their parents, but in the      street or from older companions, that they learnt the facts of      sex. The parents usually imagined that their children were      absolutely ignorant of these matters, and were astonished to      realize their mistake; \"parents do not know their children, nor      have they the least idea of what their children know, or what      their children talk about and do when away from them.\" The      parents guilty of this neglect to instruct their children, are,      Lindsey declares, traitors to their children. From his own      experience he judges that nine-tenths of the girls who \"go      wrong,\" whether or not they sink in the world, do so owing to the      inattention of their parents, and that in the case of most      prostitutes the mischief is really done before the age of twelve;      \"every wayward girl I have talked to has assured me of this      truth.\" He considers that nine-tenths of school-boys and      school-girls, in town or country, are very inquisitive regarding      matters of sex, and, to his own amazement, he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#20)"],[1,"beholding, took the King by the right hand, saying, _nunquam  inveterascat haec manus_, let this hand never wax old, or be corrupted;  which came to pass. This arm was first deposited at Bamburgh, a  religious place in Yorkshire.[31] Walter of Whittlesey writing the story  thereof, tells that it was brought to the monastery of Burgh by  Winegotus of Bebeberch, but saith not when, therefore I cannot  conjecture better than that it was by the procurement of this Abbot  Elsinus. It is said that this arm wrought many cures upon several  diseased folk; and that it was of such fame in the days of King  Stephen, as that he himself came to Peterburgh purposely to see it; and  offered his ring to S. Oswald, and also remitted to the monastery the  sum of forty marks wherein it was indebted unto him.\" It is specially  recorded in the Chronicle that this abbot took advantage of the poverty  of an abbey in Normandy, the district having been afflicted with a  grievous famine, and purchased from it the body of S. Florentinus, with  the exception of the head, for one hundred pounds of silver.    He was succeeded by =Arwinus= (1055-1057), a monk of the house, but he  resigned the government in two years. Next came =Leofric= (1057-1066), a  very eminent man, said to have been of royal descent. He was nephew to  Leofric, Earl of Coventry. In the time of this abbot, William of  Normandy invaded England, and Leofric was for some time with the English  army. But in consequence of ill health he was obliged to leave it and  return to his monastery, where he died the same year. He is highly  praised in the Chronicle as \"_pulcherrimus Monachorum, flos et decus  Abbatum_.\"    =Brando= (1066-1069), succeeded, and greatly offended King William by  applying to Edgar Atheling for confirmation of his appointment. He was  uncle to Hereward, the Saxon patriot, and created him knight. At his  death a Norman was appointed, =Turold=, of Fescamp (1069-1098); but \"he  neither loved his monastery, nor his convent him.\" During the interval  between Brando's death and Turold's arrival, a partial destruction of  the monastery took place. This has been already described. Some account  for Hereward's share in the attack and in the carrying off of the  treasures by supposing that he meant to restore them when the rule of  the Norman Abbot came to an end. When Turold arrived at Peterborough he  brought with him a force of 160 well-armed Normans. Joining the forces  of Ivo Taillebois he attacked the Camp of Refuge near Ely. The attacking  party was repulsed by Hereward, and Turold taken prisoner, and only  liberated upon paying a heavy ransom. Soon afterwards the Abbot is said  to have received into the monastery two monks from beyond sea, \"who  secretly stole away, and carried many of the Church Goods with them.\" At  length he was made Bishop in France, and the monastery trusted they had  seen the last of him. But he was ignominiously expelled in four days,  and was permitted, upon paying a large sum of money to the king, to  resume his abbacy.    [Illustration: Rose Windows and Details of West Front.]    Another uncle of Hereward's, =Godric= (1099-1103), brother of Brando,  became the next abbot. The monks had purchased from the king the right  to elect their own abbot; and Godric, being considered by this  transaction to have committed simony, was (with the neighbouring abbots  of Ely and Ramsey) deposed by a council held under the presidency of  Archbishop Anselm.    =Matthias= (1103-1105), was brother of Geoffrey, the Chief Justice, who  was drowned at the foundering of The White Ship, when Prince William,  the King's son, was lost. After the death of Matthias there was a  vacancy of three years, until =Ernulf= (1107-1114), Prior of Canterbury  came. He became Bishop of Rochester, and died in 1124.    =John de Sais= (1114-1125), probably came from Sees, in Normandy; though  he is sometimes called John of Salisbury. In 1116 nearly the whole town  was consumed by a fire that lasted nine days. It began in the bakehouse  of the monastery and completely destroyed the church and most of the  abbey buildings, the Chapter House, Refectory and Dormitory alone  escaping. In March 1118 (or, as then written, 1117), the commencement  was made of the building that now exists. Abbot John died in 1125; and  again the King kept the abbey in his own hands for more than two years.    =Henry of Anjou= (1128-1133), where he was Abbot, was a kinsman of the  King. He had numerous preferments abroad; and after five years here was  forced to resign and to betake himself to Anjou.    =Martin de Vecti= (1133-1155), had been Prior of S. Neots. Gunton  considers he came originally from the Isle of Wight, Vectis; Dean  Patrick thinks he derived his name from Bec, in Normandy. He was a great  builder, and was very industrious in repairing the abbey, and especially  the church.    =William of Waterville= (1155-1175), was chaplain to King Henry II. He  devoted himself to the building of the church, and the portion  attributed to him has been indicated in a previous chapter. He was also  very attentive to the management of the estates of the monastery, and to  acquiring new ones; but his business capacity seems to have brought him  into some disrepute and to have raised some enemies, who accused him to  the King; and by the King's order he was deposed in the Chapter-house,  as Dean Patrick relates[32] \"before a multitude of abbots and monks;  being neither convicted of any crime, nor confessing any, but privily  accused to the Archbishop by some monks.\" It is recorded that he  appealed to the Pope against the sentence of deprivation, but without  success.    =Benedict= (1177-1193), was Prior of Canterbury; and, towards the end of  his life, Keeper of the Great Seal. He had a heavy task at the beginning  of his rule in restoring discipline, which had become lax, and in  reforming many evil customs that had crept into the house. He was an  author, and produced a work on the career of S. Thomas of Canterbury,  whose murder had taken place only seven years before Benedict came to  Peterborough. He gave many ornaments and vestments to the church, and  brought several relics; and in particular some of Thomas a Becket (and  those we can certainly believe were more authentic than most relics),  among which are mentioned his shirt and surplice, a great quantity of  his blood in two crystal vessels, and two altars of the stone on which  he fell when he was murdered. He was, as might be expected, very zealous  in completing the chapel at the monastery gate which his predecessor had  begun to raise in honour of the martyred Archbishop. Dean Stanley[33]  speaks of Benedict's acquisition of the relics as \"one of two memorable  acts of plunder ... curiously illustrative of the prevalent passion for  such objects.\" He says Benedict was probably the most distinguished monk  of Christ Church, and after his appointment to Peterborough, \"finding  that great establishment almost entirely destitute of relics, he  returned to his own cathedral, and carried off with him the flagstones  immediately surrounding the sacred spot, with which he formed two altars  in the conventual church of his new appointment, besides two vases of  blood and part of Becket's clothing.\" Benedict, though a member of the  house and probably within the precincts, was not actually present at the  Archbishop's murder. Besides his building operations (he built nearly  all the nave of the church) he was very attentive to the landed property  of the house, successfully recovering some estates which had been  alienated.    =Andrew= (1193-1201) had been Prior. He was \"very mild and peaceable,  and made it his endeavour to plant and establish peace and tranquillity  in his flock.\" Several fresh acquisitions of land were made in his time,  and the monastery was very flourishing.    =Acharius= (1201-1214) came here from S. Albans, where he was Prior. He  devoted himself entirely to the administration of his office, managing  the affairs of the monastery with the greatest care and judgement. He  left behind him a reputation for \"order, honesty, kindness and bounty,  that from him posterity might learn how to behave themselves both in the  cloister and in the world.\"    [Illustration: Tomb of an Abbot, possibly Abbot Andrew, 1201.]    =Robert of Lindsey= (1214-1222) succeeded. This was four years after the  death of his predecessor, during which period King John had kept the  monastery in his own hands. This expression, which is of frequent  occurrence, must be understood to mean that the king took possession of  all the revenues belonging to the Abbot, and probably much more from the  property of the monastery, the expenses of which would be materially  lessened by the mere fact of there being no Abbot. Robert had been  Sacrist here, and when he was advanced to the highest office he effected  many improvements in the furniture and ornaments of the church, and in  the buildings, not only of the monastery itself, but also of the manors  and farms belonging to it. One alteration he effected is worth special  mention; many of the windows of the church previously stuffed with reeds  and straw, were glazed. The civil wars in this reign brought desolation  to many religious houses: but we do not read that Peterborough suffered.  Robert is said to have written a history of the monastery. He died in  1222. He had attended the fourth Lateran Council at Rome, in 1215; and  had fought in person for King Henry III. at Rockingham.    =Alexander of Holderness= (1222-1226), the Prior, was next appointed.  Dean Patrick gives, from Swapham, an account of a noteworthy agreement  that was made for mutual benefit between this Abbot and the Abbot of S.  Edmunds Bury. The convents \"by this league were tied in a bond of  special affection, for mutual counsel and assistance for ever. They were  so linkt together, as to account themselves one and the same convent: so  "]]]
