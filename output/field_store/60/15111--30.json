The blind Milton of \"Paradise  Lost\" (as the late Mr. Grant Allen once remarked to me), dwells much on  scents; in this case it is doubtless to the blindness and not to any  special organic predisposition that we must attribute this direction of  sensory attention.[47] Among our older English poets, also, Herrick  displays a special interest in odors with a definite realization of their  sexual attractiveness.[48] Shelley, who was alive to so many of the  unusual aesthetic aspects of things, often shows an enthusiastic delight in  odors, more especially those of flowers. It may, indeed, be said that most  poets--though to a less degree than those I have mentioned--devote a  special attention to odors, and, since it has been possible to describe  smell as the sense of imagination, this need not surprise us. That  Shakespeare, for instance, ranked this sense very high indeed is shown by  various passages in his works and notably by Sonnet LIV: \"O, how much more  doth beauty beauteous seem?\"--in which he implicitly places the attraction  of odor on at least as high a level as that of vision.[49]    A neurasthenic sensitiveness to odors, specially sexual odors, is  frequently accompanied by lack of sexual vigor. In this way we may account  for the numerous cases in which old men in whom sexual desire survives the  loss of virile powers--probably somewhat abnormal persons at the  outset--find satisfaction in sexual odors. Here, also, we have the basis  for olfactory fetichism. In such fetichism the odor of the woman alone,  whoever she may be and however unattractive she may be, suffices to  furnish complete sexual satisfaction. In many, although not all, of those  cases in which articles of women's clothing become the object of  fetichistic attraction, there is certainly an olfactory element due to the  personal odor attaching to the garments.[50]        Olfactory influences play a certain part in various sexually      abnormal tendencies and practices which do not proceed from an      exclusively olfactory fascination. Thus, _cunnilingus_ and      _fellatio_ derive part of their attraction, more especially in      some individuals, from a predilection for the odors of the sexual      parts. (See, e.g., Moll, _Untersuchungen ueber die Libido      Sexualis_, bd. 1, p. 134.) In many cases smell plays no part in      the attraction; \"I enjoy _cunnilingus_, if I like the girl very      much,\" a correspondent writes, \"_in spite_ of the smell.\" We may      associate this impulse with the prevalence of these practices      among sexual inverts, in whom olfactory attractions are often      specially marked. Those individuals, also, who are sexually      affected by the urinary and alvine excretions (\"_renifleurs_,\"      \"_stereoraires_,\" etc.) are largely, though not necessarily      altogether, moved by olfactory impressions. The attraction was,      however, exclusively olfactory in the case of the young woman      recorded by Moraglia (_Archivio di Psichiatria_, 1892, p. 267),      who was irresistibly excited by the odor of the fermented urine      of men, and possibly also in the case narrated to Moraglia by      Prof. L. Bianchi (ib. p. 568), in which a wife required flatus      from her husband.        The sexual pleasure derived from partial strangulation (discussed      in the study of \"Love and Pain\" in a previous volume) may be      associated with heightened olfactory sexual excitation. Dr.      Kiernan, who points this out to me, has investigated a few      neuropathic patients who like to have their necks squeezed, as      they express it, and finds that in the majority the olfactory      sensibility is thus intensified.    Even in ordinary normal persons, however, there can be no doubt that  personal odor tends to play a not inconsiderable part in sexual  attractions and sexual repulsions. As a sexual excitant, indeed, it comes  far behind the stimuli received through the sense of sight. The  comparative bluntness of the sense of smell in man makes it difficult for  olfactory influence to be felt, as a rule, until the preliminaries of  courtship are already over; so that it is impossible for smell ever to  possess the same significance in sexual attraction in man that it  possesses in the lower animals. With that reservation there can be no  doubt that odor has a certain favorable or unfavorable influence in sexual  relationships in all human races from the lowest to the highest. The  Polynesian spoke with contempt of those women of European race who \"have  no smell,\" and in view of the pronounced personal odor of so many savage  peoples as well as of the careful attention which they so often pay to  odors, we may certainly assume, even in the absence of much definite  evidence, that smell counts for much in their sexual relationships. This  is confirmed by such practices as that found among some primitive  peoples--as, it is stated, in the Philippines--of lovers exchanging their  garments to have the smell of the loved one about them. In the barbaric  stages of society this element becomes self-conscious and is clearly  avowed; personal odors are constantly described with complacency,  sometimes as mingled with the lavish use of artificial perfumes, in much  of the erotic literature produced in the highest stages of barbarism,  especially by Eastern peoples living in hot climates; it is only necessary  to refer to the _Song of Songs_, the _Arabian Nights_, and the Indian  treatises on love. Even in some parts of Europe the same influence is  recognized in the crudest animal form, and Krauss states that among the  Southern Slavs it is sometimes customary to leave the sexual parts  unwashed because a strong odor of these parts is regarded as a sexual  stimulant. Under the usual conditions of life in Europe personal odor has  sunk into the background; this has been so equally under the conditions of  classic, mediaeval, and modern life. Personal odor has been generally  regarded as unaesthetic; it has, for the most part, only been mentioned to  be reprobated, and even those poets and others who during recent centuries  have shown a sensitive delight and interest in odors--Herrick, Shelley,  Baudelaire, Zola, and Huysmans--have seldom ventured to insist that a  purely natural and personal odor can be agreeable. The fact that it may be  so, and that for most people such odors cannot be a matter of indifference  in the most intimate of all relationships, is usually only to be learned  casually and incidentally. There can be no doubt, however, that, as  Kiernan points out, the extent to which olfaction influences the sexual  sphere in civilized man has been much underestimated. We need not,  therefore, be surprised at the greater interest which has recently been  taken in this subject. As usually happens, indeed, there has been in some  writers a tendency to run to the opposite extreme, and we cannot, with  Gustav Jaeger, regard the sexual instinct as mainly or altogether an  olfactory matter.        Of the Padmini, the perfect woman, the \"lotus woman,\" Hindu      writers say that \"her sweat has the odor of musk,\" while the      vulgar woman, they say, smells of fish (_Kama Sutra of      Vatsyayana_). Ploss and Bartels (_Das Weib_, 1901, p. 218) bring      forward a passage from the Tamil _Kokkogam_, minutely describing      various kinds of sexual odor in women, which they regard as      resting on sound observation.        Four things in a woman, says the Arab, should be perfumed: the      mouth, the armpits, the pudenda, and the nose. The Persian poets,      in describing the body, delighted to use metaphors involving      odor. Not only the hair and the down on the face, but the chin,      the mouth, the beauty spots, the neck, all suggested odorous      images. The epithets applied to the hair frequently refer to      musk, ambergris, and civet. (_Anis El-Ochchaq_ translated by      Huart, _Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes_, fasc. 25,      1875.)        The Hebrew _Song of Songs_ furnishes a typical example of a very      beautiful Eastern love-poem in which the importance of the appeal      to the sense of smell is throughout emphasized. There are in this      short poem as many as twenty-four fairly definite references to      odors,--personal odors, perfumes, and flowers,--while numerous      other references to flowers, etc., seem to point to olfactory      associations. Both the lover and his sweetheart express pleasure      in each other's personal odor.            \"My beloved is unto me,\" she sings, \"as a bag of myrrh          That lieth between my breasts;          My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers          In the vineyard of En-gedi.\"        And again: \"His cheeks are as a bed of spices [or balsam], as      banks of sweet herbs.\" While of her he says: \"The smell of thy      breath [or nose] is like apples.\"        Greek and Roman antiquity, which has so largely influenced the      traditions of modern Europe, was lavish in the use of perfumes,      but showed no sympathy with personal odors. For the Roman      satirists, like Martial, a personal odor is nearly always an      unpleasant odor, though, there are a few allusions in classic      literature recognizing bodily smell as a sexual attraction. Ovid,      in his _Ars Amandi_ (Book III), says it is scarcely necessary to      remind a lady that she must not keep a goat in her armpits:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#20)"],[1,"its disturbances as the most important in the whole mechanism of      life. The description of other disorders I could read in cold      blood, but intussusception of the bowels makes me ill even      to-day. I am always extremely pleased to hear that the digestion      of the people around me is in good condition. A man who did not      sufficiently watch over his digestion aroused distrust in me, and      I imagined that wicked men must be horribly indifferent regarding      this weighty matter. Even more than in ordinary persons was I      interested in the digestion of more mysterious beings, like      magicians in legends, or men of other nations. I would willingly      have made an anthropological study of my favorite subject, only      to my annoyance books nearly always pass over the matter in      silence. In history and fiction I regretted the absence of      information concerning the state of my heroes' digestion when      they languished in prison or in some unaccustomed or unhealthy      spot. For this reason I held no book more precious than one which      describes how a young man after being shipwrecked lived for a      long time in a narrow snow-hut, and it was conscientiously stated      that he became aware of digestive disturbances. No immorality      angers me more than the foolish practice of ladies who in society      neglect the satisfaction of their natural needs from misplaced      motives of modesty. On a railway journey I suffer horribly from      the thought that one of my fellow-travelers may be prevented from      fulfilling some imperative natural necessity.        \"I naturally devote the greatest attention to my own digestion.      With painful conscientiousness I go to stool every day at the      same hour; if the operation does not come off to my satisfaction      I feel not so much physical as mental discomfort. To this quite      useful hygienic interest became associated at puberty a sensual      interest. Since my fourteenth year I have had no greater      enjoyment than to defecate undressed (I do not do so now) after      having first carefully examined the distension of my abdomen. In      summer I would go into the woods, undress myself in a secluded      spot and indulge in the voluptuous pleasures of defecation. I      would sometimes combine with this a bath in a stream. I would      exhaust my imagination in the effort to invent specially      enjoyable variations, longed for a desert island where I could go      about naked, fill my body with much nourishing food, hold in the      excrement as long as possible and then discharge it in some      subtly-thought-out spot. These practices and ideas often caused      erections and later on emissions, but the genitals played no part      in my conceptions; their movements were uncomfortable and gave no      pleasure.        \"I soon longed to be associated in these orgies with some boy of      the same age, but I wanted not only a companion in my passion,      but also a real friend. Since there could be no question of      masturbation or paederasty, our love would have been limited to      kisses, embraces, and--as a compensation for coitus--defecation      together. That would have been perfect bliss to me. I will spare      you the unaesthetic contents of my voluptuous dreams. But I      remained without a companion, and, therefore, without real      enjoyment. [He has, however, on various occasions experienced      erections, and even emissions, on seeing, by chance, men or boys      defecate.] Hinc illae lacrimae; the excitement over my own      defecation only took place _faute de mieux_.        \"I knew very well that my thoughts and practices were impure and      contemptible. Ah! how often, when the intoxication was over, have      I thrown myself remorsefully on my knees, praying to God for      pardon! For some weeks I repressed my longing; but at last it was      too strong for me, I tried to justify myself and fell into my      vice anew. That I was guilty of licentiousness and loved boys      sexually first became clear to me later on, when I knew the      significance of erection as a sign of sexual excitement.        \"No one can imagine with what demoniacal joy I am possessed at      the thought of a beautiful naked boy whose abdomen is filled as      the result of long abstinence from stool. The thought powerfully      excites me, a flood of passion goes through my blood and my limbs      tremble. I would never grow tired of feeling that belly and      looking at it. My passion would express itself in tempestuous      caresses, and the boy would have to assume various positions in      order to show off the beauty of his form, i.e., to bring the      parts in question into better view. To observe defecation would      still further increase this peculiar enjoyment. If the boy's      bowels were not sufficiently filled I would feed him with all      sorts of food which produces much excrement, such as potatoes,      coarse bread, etc. If possible I would seek to delay defecation      for two or three days, so that it might be as copious as      possible. When at last it occurred it would be an unspeakable joy      for me to watch the faeces--which would have to be fairly      firm--emerging from the anus.\"        X. would like to be a teacher and thinks he could exert a      beneficial influence on boys. In spite of the pain he has      suffered he does not think he would like to be cured of his      perverse inclinations, for they have given him joy as well as      pain, and the pain has chiefly been owing to the fact that he      could not gratify his inclinations. X. smokes and drinks in      moderation, and has no feminine habits. (The foregoing is a      condensed summary of the case which is fully reported by Moll,      _Kontraere Sexualempfindung_, third edition, pp. 295-305.)        The case of coprolagnia communicated to me is that of a married      man, normal in all other respects, intellectually brilliant and      filling successfully a very responsible position. When a child      the women of his household were always indifferent as to his      presence in their bedrooms, and would satisfy all natural calls      without reserve before him. He would dream of this with      erections. His sexual interests became slowly centered in the act      of defecation, and this fetich throughout life never appealed to      him so powerfully as when associated with the particular type of      household furniture which was used for this purpose in his own      house. The act of defecation in the opposite sex or anything      pertaining to or suggesting the same caused uncontrollable sexual      excitement; the nates also exerted a great attraction. The alvine      excreta exerted this influence even in the absence of the woman;      it was, however, necessary that she should be a sexually      desirable person. The perversion in this case was not complete;      that is to say, that the excitement produced by the act of      defecation or the excretion itself was not actually preferred to      coitus; the sexual idea was normal coitus in the normal manner,      but preceded by the visual and olfactory enjoyment of the      exciting fetich. When coitus was not possible the enjoyment of      the fetich was accompanied by masturbation (as in the analogous      case of urolagnia in a woman summarized on p. 62.) On one      occasion he was discovered by a friend in a bedroom belonging to      a woman, engaged in the act of masturbation over a vessel      containing the desired fetich. In an agony of shame he begged the      mercy of silence concerning this episode, at the same time      revealing his life-history. He has constantly been haunted by the      dread of detection, as well as by remorse and the consciousness      of degradation, also by the fear that his unconquerable obsession      may lead him to the asylum.    The scatalogic groups of sexual perversions, urolagnia and coprolagnia, as  may be sufficiently seen in this brief summary, are not merely olfactory  fetiches. They are, in a larger proportion of cases, dynamic symbols, a  preoccupation with physiological acts which, by associations of contiguity  and still more of resemblance, have gained the virtue of stimulating in  slight cases, and replacing in more extreme cases, the normal  preoccupation with the central physiological act itself. We have seen that  there are various considerations which amply suffice to furnish a basis  for such associations. And when we reflect that in the popular mind, and  to some extent in actual fact, the sexual act itself is, like urination  and defecation, an excretory act, we can understand that the true  excretory acts may easily become symbols of the pseudo-excretory act. It  is, indeed, in the muscular release of accumulated pressures and tensions,  involved by the act of liberating the stored-up excretion, that we have  the closest simulacrum of the tumescence and detumescence of the sexual  process.[32]    In this way the erotic symbolism of urolagnia and coprolagnia is  completely analogous with that dynamic symbolism of the clinging and  swinging garments which Herrick has so accurately described, with the  complex symbolism of flagellation and its play of the rod against the  blushing and trembling nates, with the symbols of sexual strain and stress  which are embodied in the foot and the act of treading.      FOOTNOTES:    [24] Fuchs (_Das Erotische Element In der Karikatur_, p. 26),  distinguishing sharply between the \"erotic\" and the \"obscene,\" reserves  the latter term exclusively for the representation of excretory organs and  acts. He considers that this is etymologically the most exact usage.  However that may be, it seems to me that, in any case, \"obscene\" has  become so vague a term that it is now impracticable to give it a  restricted and precise sense.    [25] In this connection "]]]
