According to recent advices from New Zealand, only L2000 of this  advance has been paid back, and it is the general feeling of the  colony that the project has proved a failure. These, and other  experiments of a similar character, compel us to recognise the  disagreeable fact that a certain proportion of people who are in the  habit of falling out of work are, as a class, extremely difficult to  put properly on their legs. Failure, for some reason or another,  always dogs their steps, and the more Society does for them, the less  they will be disposed to do anything for themselves.    When such persons are sent to prison on charges of begging, or petty  theft, it very often happens that they are assisted on their release  by a Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society. Tools are given them, work is  found for them, yet they do not thrive. Not infrequently the job is  given up on some frivolous pretext; or if it is a temporary one,  little or no effort is made till it actually comes to an end to look  out for another. It is little wonder that men who live in such a  fashion should occasionally be destitute; the only wonder is that they  manage to pass through life at all. Those men hang upon the skirts of  labour and seek shelter under its banner, but it is only for short and  irregular intervals that they march in the ranks of the actual  workers. The real working man knows such people well, and heartily  despises them.    Would it be a right thing to increase the burdens of the taxpayer by  opening State workshops, even if such a plan were feasible, for men of  the stamp we have just been describing? Decidedly it would not. Yet  these men form a fair proportion of the persons whom we have classed  as driven to crime by economic distress. As far, then, as the criminal  population is concerned, no necessity exists for the organisation of  State factories; and so far as destitution is a factor in the  production of crime, it can be grappled with by other agencies. In  fact, if a graduated system of Unions, with a kind of casual ward,  somewhat after the German Naturalverpflegstationen, could be worked  and if Trade Societies adopted, under proper precautions, the  principle of allowing debilitated members of their trade the  opportunity of doing something at a somewhat reduced rate, it would be  impossible for any well-intentioned man to say that he was driven to  crime from sheer want. It is worth while, on the part of the nation,  to make some small sacrifice to attain an object so supremely  important as this. It is very probable that hardly any sacrifice will  be needed. In any case it would get rid of the uncomfortable feeling  entertained by many that there are occasions when human beings are  punished who ought to be fed. It would completely alienate all  sympathy from crime; it would then be known that criminal offenders  deserved the punishment they received, and justice would be able to  deal with them with a firm and even hand.          CHAPTER V.    POVERTY AND CRIME.      Having analysed the part played by destitution in the production of  crime, the cognate question of the extent to which poverty is  responsible for it will now be considered. If actual destitution does  not count for very much in producing criminals, it may be that poverty  makes up the difference, and that the great bulk of delinquency, if  not the whole of it, arises from the combined operation of these two  economic factors. We have examined one of them, let us now go on to  the other. As this examination will have to be conducted from several  different points of view which, for the sake of clearness, it will be  expedient to consider one by one, I shall begin by inquiring what  light international statistics are capable of throwing on the  relations between poverty and crime. At the outset of this inquiry we  are at once met by the old difficulty respecting the value of  international criminal statistics. The imperfection of those  statistics is a matter it is always important to bear in mind, but in  spite of this circumstance the light which they shed on the problem of  poverty and crime is not to be rejected as worthless.    It has been pointed out in the preceding chapter that the offences  people, in a state of destitution, are most likely to commit are  beggary and theft. In the case of persons who are in a state of  poverty, but not destitute, it may be said that the offence they are  most likely to commit is theft in one or other of its forms. What then  are the international statistics of theft, and what is the relative  wealth of the several countries from which these statistics are drawn?  An answer to these two questions will throw a flood of light upon the  nature of the relations between poverty and crime. If these statistics  show that in those countries where there is most poverty there is also  most theft, the elucidation of such a fact will at once raise a strong  presumption that the connection between poverty and offences against  property is one of cause and effect. If, on the other hand,  international statistics are not at all conclusive upon this important  point, it will show that there are other factors at work besides  poverty in the production of offences against property. With these  preliminary remarks I shall now append a table of the number of  persons tried for theft of all kinds in some of the most important  countries of Europe within the last few years. In no two of these  countries is theft classified in the same manner, but in all of them  it is equally recognised as a crime; if, therefore, all offences  against property, of whatever kind, are put together under the common  heading of \"theft,\" and if the number of cases of thefts (as thus  understood) tried in the various countries of Europe are carefully  tabulated, we possess, in such a table, a criterion wherewith to  judge, in a rough way, the respective position of those countries in  the matter of offences against property.    The appended table is extracted from a larger one, the work of Sig. L.  Bodio, Director-General of Statistics for the kingdom of Italy. The  calculations for every country, except Spain, are based on the census  of 1880 or 1881; the calculations for Spain are based on the census of  1877. In all the countries except Germany and Spain the calculations  are based on an average of five years; for Germany and Spain the  average is only two years.    Italy,    1880-84  Annual trials for theft per 100,000 inhabitants 221  France,   1879-83              do.                do.              121  Belgium,  1876-80              do.                do.              143  Germany,  1882-83              do.                do.              262  England,  1880-84              do.                do.              228  Scotland, 1880-84              do.                do.              289  Ireland,  1880-84              do.                do.              101  Hungary,  1876-80              do.                do.               82  Spain,    1883-84              do.                do.               74    To what conclusions do the statistics contained in this table point?  It is useless burdening this chapter with additional figures to prove  that England and France are the two wealthiest countries in Europe.  The wealth of England, for instance, is perhaps six times the wealth  of Italy; but, notwithstanding this fact, more thefts are annually  committed in England than in Italy. The wealth of France is enormously  superior to the wealth of Ireland, both in quantity and distribution,  but the population of France commits more offences against property  than the Irish. Spain is one of the poorest countries in Europe,  Scotland is one of the richest, but side by side with this inequality  of wealth we see that the Scotch commit, per hundred thousand of the  population, almost four times as many thefts as the Spaniards. With  the exception of Italy it is the poorest countries of Europe that are  the least dishonest, and, according to our table, even the Italians  are not so much addicted to offences against property as the  inhabitants of England.    Perhaps the most instructive figures in these international statistics  are those relating to England and Ireland. The criminal statistics of  the two countries are drawn up on very much the same principles; the  ordinary criminal law is very much the same, and there is very much  the same feeling among the population with respect to ordinary crime;  in fact, with the exception of agrarian offences, the administration  of the law in Ireland is as effective as it is in England. On almost  every point the similarity of the criminal law and its administration  in the two countries almost amounts to identity, and a comparison of  their criminal statistics, in so far as they relate to ordinary  offences against property, reaches a high level of exactitude. What  does such a comparison reveal? It shows that the Irish, with all their  poverty, are not half so much addicted to offences against property as  the English with all their wealth, and it serves to confirm the idea  that the connection between poverty and theft is not so close as is  generally imagined.    International statistics then, as far as they go, point to the  conclusion that it is the growth of wealth, rather than the reverse,  which has a tendency to augment the number of offences against  property, and national statistics, as far as England is concerned,  exhibit a similar result. It is perfectly certain, for instance, that  the mass of the population possessed a greater amount of money, and  were earning on the whole higher wages between 1870-74 than between  1884-88. According to the evidence given before the late Lord  Iddesleigh's Commission on the depression of trade, the prosperity of  the country in the five years ended 1874 was something phenomenal.

Washers Fastened on Spools.]    [Illustration: Fig. 190. The Combination Lock.]    We found it necessary to close the entrance of our cave with a door  fastened with a padlock, so as to keep meddlers out. The entire school  had watched us build the cave house, and, of course, knew just where our  entrance lay. Then, in addition to the outer door, we put in another  one, half-way down the dark passageway. On this Bill rigged up a simple  combination lock which would baffle any one who managed to pick the  padlock. This inner door opened outward. It was hinged to the floor of  the passageway, and swung up against a frame set in the passageway. At  the top was a board whose lower edge lay flush with the edge of the door  when it was closed. For the combination lock we used a couple of spools,  each with one head cut off and the central hole plugged up with a stick  of wood. In the floor and the top board of the frame, holes were drilled  just large enough for the shanks of the spools to fit snugly in them.  Next we made a trip to a hardware store for a file and a couple of large  copper washers, about 1-1/4 inches in diameter. The washers were  fastened to the inner ends of the spools after they had been pushed  through the hole. The washer on the door came just to the edge of the  door, while the other extended below the door frame and lapped under the  door washer. Then in the edge of the washer on the frame a notch was  filed, while in the other washer two notches were filed, so as to leave  a tooth which fitted snugly into the notch of the first washer (see  Figs. 188, 189). The door was locked by turning both the washers until  the notch and tooth came in line with each other, then pushing the tooth  through the notch, and turning the washers so that the frame washer  hooked over the door washer. Then the door could be opened only when the  tooth and notch were brought in line.    On the head of each spool we pasted a disk of white cardboard, the edge  of which was graduated, as in Fig. 190. Then we had a secret  combination, say 11-19, which meant that when the spools were turned so  that the number 11 on the door spool came in line with the number 19 on  the frame spool the tooth and notch would be in line, and the door could  then be opened. Of course, this combination was known to the members of  the club only, and any one outside who tried to open the door might have  tried for some time without bringing the tooth and notch into line with  each other. Occasionally we changed the combination by loosening the  screws which held the washers, and turning them so that the notch and  tooth came opposite different numbers on the dials. This was done so  that if any one should chance to learn our combination he could not make  use of it very long.          CHAPTER XVI.    SCOOTERS.      \"Hello, Dutchy! What in thunder have you got there?\"    It was Bill who spoke. We were on our way home for the winter holidays,  and had been held up at Millville by Reddy Schreiner, who had informed  us that Dutchy was down by the river with the boat to give us a sail up  to Lamington.    A vision of a fleet ice boat skimming up the river at express train  speed swam before our eyes. But the next moment, as we turned the corner  into River Street, we were surprised by the sight of our old scow just  off the pier at anchor, and in open water. It was rigged up with a jib  and mainsail, which were flapping idly in the wind. It had also been  altered by decking over the top, with the exception of a small cockpit,  evidently for the purpose of keeping out the water when she heeled over  under the wind. We were disappointed and quite annoyed at not finding  the ice boat on hand; furthermore, our annoyance was considerably  heightened by Dutchy's broad grin of evident delight at our  discomfiture. \"The river wasn't all frozen over,\" he explained, \"and we  couldn't bring the ice boat down, so we rigged up the scow and she came  down splendidly.\"      A SAIL IN THE SCOW.    There was nothing to do but to jump in, though I, for one, would have  taken the train in preference had there been one inside of two hours.  Dutchy, however, seemed to be in a surprisingly good humor, and kept up  a lively chatter about things that the club had made in our absence. The  skis, which have already been described on page 42, had been built under  Reddy's guidance, and they had already used them on Willard's Hill,  coasting down like a streak and shooting way up into the air off a hump  at the bottom. Then there was the toboggan slide down Randall's Hill,  and way across the river on the ice.      OUR CRAFT STRIKES THE ICE.    Dutchy talked so incessantly that we hadn't noticed the field of ice  which we were nearing. Just at this point Bill turned around with an  exclamation.    \"Here, Dutchy, you crazy fellow, where are you going to? Hard to port,  man--hard aport--or you will crash into the ice!\"    But Dutchy only grinned nervously.    \"I tell you, you will smash the boat!\" Bill cried again, making a dive  for the steering oar; but just then the boat struck the ice, and both  Bill and I were thrown backward into the bottom of the boat. But the  boat didn't smash.    [Illustration: A Sail on the Scooter Scow.]    There was a momentary grinding and crunching noise, and, much to my  surprise, I found that the old scow had lifted itself clean out of the  water, and was skating right along on the ice. Then Dutchy could control  himself no longer. He laughed, and laughed, as if he never would stop.  He laughed until the steering oar dropped from his hands, and the old  scow, with the head free, swung around and plunged off the ice ledge  with a heavy splash into the open water again. Then Reddy, who was  almost equally convulsed, came to his senses. \"Now you've done it,  Dutchy; you're a fine skipper, you are! How do you expect to get us back  to shore again?\" The steering oar was left behind us on the ice, and  there we were drifting on the open water, with no rudder and no oar to  bring us back.      THE SCOOTER SCOW.    [Illustration: Fig. 191. Scow with Runners nailed on.]    The only thing we could do was to wait until the wind or current carried  us to the ice or land. In the meantime Dutchy, who had suddenly sobered  down when we took our water plunge, explained how he had rigged up the  scow to travel both on ice and on water. He called the rig a sled boat,  but the name by which such a rig is now known is a \"scooter.\" It was  Dutchy's idea primarily, but Reddy had engineered the work. Along the  bottom of the scow two strips of hickory had been nailed to serve as  runners. The hickory strips had been bent up at the forward end, as  shown in Fig. 191. Each runner was shod with a strip of brass, fastened  on with flathead screws, which were countersunk, so that the heads  should not project below the brass. This virtually made a sledge out of  the old scow, and didn't spoil it for use on the water.      A SPRIT SAIL.    [Illustration: Fig. 192. Mainsail of Scooter Scow.]    [Illustration: Fig. 193. The Snotter.]    [Illustration: Fig. 194. Jib-sail of Scooter Scow.]    A sprit sail and jib were rigged up. The dimensions of these sails,  which were taken from a book in Mr. Van Syckel's library, are given in  the illustrations. A sheet of heavy muslin was made to measure 7 feet  square, as indicated by dotted lines in the drawing; then the corners  were cut off along the full lines shown in the illustration. The edges  were now hemmed all around, and the lower edge of the sail was lashed to  a boom, 7 feet 6 inches long. To the luff were attached a number of mast  rings, which were slipped over a stout mast projecting about 5 feet 6  inches above the deck of the boat. The peak of the sail was held up by a  spar called a sprit. The sprit was sharpened at each end, and the point  at the upper end was inserted in a loop of heavy cord fastened to the  peak of the sail, while the lower point of the sprit rested in the loop  of a rope on the mast, called a \"snotter.\" The snotter was a short piece  of rope with a loop at each end. It was wrapped around the mast, as  shown in the drawing, with one loop holding it in place, like a slip  knot, and the other supporting the end of the sprit. A single halyard  was used to raise this sail. It was attached to the boat and passed over  a block in the mast. When raising the sail it was first partly hoisted,  then the sprit was hooked in the loop and the snotter, after which the  throat halyard was drawn taut. Then the snotter was pulled up the mast  as far as it would go, flattening out the sail. The jib-sail was made  out of the large corner piece left when cutting the mainsail. The  dimensions of the jib-sail are given in Fig. 194. It was such a small  sail that no boom was used with it. In place of a rudder the steering  oar had to be used. This was made of a rake handle with a large trowel  blade fastened to the end of it. The sharp blade cut into the ice, and  so steered the scow when it was running as an ice boat, and in the water  the blade offered sufficient resistance to act as a rudder.      SCOOTER SAILING.    But to return to our sail home to Lamington, we were not out on the open  water long before the current carried us back to the ice ledge. Reddy  jumped off and soon returned with the steering oar; then we proceeded on  our way homeward, now in the water and now on ice. Once or twice the  scow was unable to climb out of the water, because she had not  sufficient headway, and was clumsy and heavy with four boys aboard. Then  we had to push off until we could get a sufficient start. It struck me  that while Dutchy was quite clever to think of such a rig, yet it was  very clumsy and capable of much improvement. Bill wasn't saying very  much all this time, and I could see he was doing a lot of thinking.  Evidently he was"]]]
