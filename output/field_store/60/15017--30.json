VII    HOW INDIA IS GOVERNED    The present form of government in India was adopted in 1858,  after the terrible Sepoy mutiny had demonstrated the inability of  the East India Company to control affairs. By an act of parliament  all territory, revenues, tributes and property of that great  corporation, which had a monopoly of the Indian trade, and, next  to the Hanseatic League of Germany, was the greatest Trust ever  formed, were vested in the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,  who in 1876 assumed the additional title of Empress of India. The  title and authority were inherited by Edward VII. He governs through  the Secretary of State for India, who is a Cabinet minister, and  a Council of not less than ten members, nine of whom must have  the practical knowledge and experience gained by a residence of at  least ten years in India and not more than ten years previous to  the date of their appointment. This Council is more of an advisory  than an executive body. It has no initiative or authority, but  is expected to confer with and review the acts of the Secretary  of State for India, who can make no grants or appropriations  from the revenues or decide any questions of importance without  the concurrence of a majority of its members. The Council meets  every week in London, receives reports and communications and  acts upon them.    The supreme authority in India is the Viceroy, the direct personal  representative of the emperor in all his relations with his  300,000,000 Indian subjects; but, as a matter of convenience,  he makes his reports to and receives his instructions from the  Secretary of State for India, who represents that part of the  empire both in the ministry and in parliament. The present viceroy  is the Right Honorable George Nathaniel Curzon, who was raised  to the peerage in October, 1898, as Baron Curzon of Kedleston.  He is the eldest son of Lord Scarsdale, was born Jan. 11, 1859,  was educated at Eton and Oxford; selected journalism as his  profession; became correspondent of the London Times in China,  India and Persia; was elected to parliament from Lancashire in  1886, and served until 1898; was private secretary to the Marquis  of Salisbury, and under-secretary of state for India in 1891-92;  under-secretary of state for foreign affairs in 1895-98; married  Mary Leiter, daughter of Mr. L. Z. Leiter of Washington and Chicago,  in 1895, and was appointed viceroy of India to succeed the Earl  of Elgin, September, 1898.    There have been twenty-five viceroys or governors general of  India since Warren Hastings in 1774, and the list includes some  of the ablest statesmen in English history, but Lord Curzon is  the only man in the list who has ever been his own successor.  When his first term expired in September, 1903, he was immediately  reappointed for another five years. Whether he continues through  the second term depends upon certain contingencies, but it is  entirely probable that he will remain, because he has undertaken  certain reforms and enterprises that he desires to complete. His  administration has been not only a conspicuous but a remarkable  success. Although he has been severely criticised for his  administrative policy and many of his official acts have been  opposed and condemned, the sources from which the criticisms  have come often corroborate the wisdom and confirm the success  of the acts complained of. Lord Cornwallis was twice Governor  General of India, but there was a long interval between his terms,  the first beginning in 1786 and the second in 1805. He is the only  man except Lord Curzon who has been twice honored by appointment  to the highest office and the greatest responsibility under the  British crown except that of the prime minister.    The Viceroy is assisted in the administration of the government  by a cabinet or council of five members, selected by himself,  subject to the approval of the king. Each member is assigned to  the supervision of one of the executive departments,--finance,  military, public works, revenue, agriculture and legislative.  The viceroy himself takes personal charge of foreign affairs.  The commander in chief of the army in India, at present Lord  Kitchener, is ex-officio member of the council.    For legislative purposes the council is expanded by the addition of  ten members, appointed by the Viceroy from among the most competent  British and native residents of India upon the recommendation  of provincial, industrial and commercial bodies. The remaining  members are the heads of the various executive departments of the  government. By these men, who serve for a period of five years,  and whose proceedings are open to the public and are reported and  printed verbatim, like the proceedings of Congress, the laws  governing India are made, subject to the approval of the Viceroy,  who retains the right of veto, and in turn is responsible to  the British parliament and to the king.    Thus it will be seen that the system of government in India is  simple and liberal. The various industries and financial interests,  and all of the great provinces which make up the empire, have a  voice in framing the laws that apply to the people at large;  but for convenience the territory is divided into nine great  provinces, as follows:    Madras, with a governor whose salary is $40,000 a year.    Bombay, whose governor receives the same salary.    Bengal, with a lieutenant governor; salary, $33,000.    United Provinces, lieutenant governor; salary, $33,000.    Punjab, lieutenant governor; salary, $33,000.    Burma, lieutenant governor; salary, $33,000.    Assam, chief commissioner; salary, $16,500.    Central Provinces, chief commissioner, $16,500.    Northwestern Frontier Province, governed by an agent to the governor  general, whose salary is $16,500.    The governors of Bombay and Madras are appointed by the king;  the lieutenant governors and commissioners by the Viceroy. All of  them have legislative councils and complete executive organizations  similar to that of the general government at Calcutta. Each makes  its own local laws and enjoys administrative independence similar to  that of the states of the American Union, and is seldom interfered  with by the Viceroy or the authorities in London, the purpose  being to encourage home rule as far as possible. The provinces  are divided into districts, which are the units of administration,  and each district is under the control of an executive officer,  who is responsible to the governor of the province.    Exclusive of the great provinces named are eighty-two of the  ancient principalities, most of them retaining their original  boundaries, governed by native chiefs, who are allowed more or  less independence, according to their ability, wisdom and zeal.  The control exercised by the central government varies in the  different states, but there are certain general rules which are  applied to all. The native princes have no right to make war or  peace, or communicate officially with each other or with foreign  governments except through the Viceroy. They are permitted to  maintain a limited independent military force; they are allowed  to impose a certain amount of taxes; no European is allowed to  reside at their courts without their consent, but commerce, trade,  industry, education, religious worship, the press and other rights  and privileges are free to all just as much as in England or the  United States. The native chiefs are not permitted to interfere with  the judiciary, which has a separate and independent organization,  as in Great Britain, with the Viceroy and the council of state  corresponding to the House of Lords, as the highest court of  appeal. Each native chief is \"assisted\" in his government by a  \"Resident,\" who is appointed by and reports to the Viceroy, and  is expected to guide the policy and official acts of the native  ruler with tact and delicacy. He remains in the background as much  as possible, assumes no authority and exercises no prerogatives,  but serves as a sort of ambassador from the Viceroy and friendly  adviser to the native prince.    The following is a list of the ruling native princes in the order  of their rank as recognized by the British government, and the  salutes to which they are entitled:    Salute of twenty-one guns--    Baroda, the Maharaja (Gaikwar) of.

Whatever may have been the artistic merits of  Michelangelo's original conception for the tomb, the spirit was in no  sense Christian. Those rows of captive Arts and Sciences, those  Victories exulting over prostrate cities, those allegorical colossi  symbolising the mundane virtues of a mighty ruler's character, crowned  by the portrait of the Pope, over whom Heaven rejoiced while Cybele  deplored his loss--all this pomp of power and parade of ingenuity  harmonised but little with the humility of a contrite soul returning  to its Maker and its Judge. The new temple, destined to supersede the  old basilica, embodied an aspect of Latin Christianity which had very  little indeed in common with the piety of the primitive Church. S.  Peter's, as we see it now, represents the majesty of Papal Rome, the  spirit of a secular monarchy in the hands of priests; it is the  visible symbol of that schism between the Teutonic and the Latin  portions of the Western Church which broke out soon after its  foundation, and became irreconcilable before the cross was placed upon  its cupola. It seemed as though in sweeping away the venerable  traditions of eleven hundred years, and replacing Rome's time-honoured  Mother-Church with an edifice bearing the brand-new stamp of hybrid  neo-pagan architecture, the Popes had wished to signalise that rupture  with the past and that atrophy of real religious life which marked the  counter-reformation.    Julius II. has been severely blamed for planning the entire  reconstruction of his cathedral. It must, however, be urged in his  defence that the structure had already, in 1447, been pronounced  insecure. Nicholas V. ordered his architects, Bernardo Rossellini and  Leo Battista Alberti, to prepare plans for its restoration. It is, of  course, impossible for us to say for certain whether the ancient  fabric could have been preserved, or whether its dilapidation had gone  so far as to involve destruction. Bearing in mind the recklessness of  the Renaissance and the passion which the Popes had for engaging in  colossal undertakings, one is inclined to suspect that the unsound  state of the building was made a pretext for beginning a work which  flattered the architectural tastes of Nicholas, but was not absolutely  necessary. However this may have been, foundations for a new tribune  were laid outside the old apse, and the wall rose some feet above the  ground before the Pope's death. Paul II. carried on the building; but  during the pontificates of Sixtus, Innocent, and Alexander it seems to  have been neglected. Meanwhile nothing had been done to injure the  original basilica; and when Julius announced his intention of  levelling it to the ground, his cardinals and bishops entreated him to  refrain from an act so sacrilegious. The Pope was not a man to take  advice or make concessions. Accordingly, turning a deaf ear to these  entreaties, he had plans prepared by Giuliano da San Gallo and  Bramante. Those eventually chosen were furnished by Bramante; and San  Gallo, who had hitherto enjoyed the fullest confidence of Julius, is  said to have left Rome in disgust. For reasons which will afterwards  appear, he could not have done so before the summer months of 1506.    It is not yet the proper time to discuss the building of S. Peter's.  Still, with regard to Bramante's plan, this much may here be said. It  was designed in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted with a huge  circular dome and flanked by two towers. Bramante used to boast that  he meant to raise the Pantheon in the air; and the plan, as preserved  for us by Serlio, shows that the cupola would have been constructed  after that type. Competent judges, however, declare that insuperable  difficulties must have arisen in carrying out this design, while the  piers constructed by Bramante were found in effect to be wholly  insufficient for their purpose. For the aesthetic beauty and the  commodiousness of his building we have the strongest evidence in a  letter written by Michelangelo, who was by no means a partial witness.  \"It cannot be denied,\" he says, \"that Bramante's talent as an  architect was equal to that of any one from the times of the ancients  until now. He laid the first plan of S. Peter's, not confused, but  clear and simple, full of light and detached from surrounding  buildings, so that it interfered with no part of the palace. It was  considered a very fine design, and indeed any one can see with his own  eyes now that it is so. All the architects who departed from  Bramante's scheme, as did Antonio da San Gallo, have departed from the  truth.\" Though Michelangelo gave this unstinted praise to Bramante's  genius as a builder, he blamed him severely both for his want of  honesty as a man, and also for his vandalism in dealing with the  venerable church he had to replace. \"Bramante,\" says Condivi, \"was  addicted, as everybody knows, to every kind of pleasure. He spent  enormously, and, though the pension granted him by the Pope was large,  he found it insufficient for his needs. Accordingly he made profit out  of the works committed to his charge, erecting the walls of poor  material, and without regard for the substantial and enduring  qualities which fabrics on so huge a scale demanded. This is apparent  in the buildings at S. Peter's, the Corridore of the Belvedere, the  Convent of San Pietro ad Vincula, and other of his edifices, which  have had to be strengthened and propped up with buttresses and similar  supports in order to prevent them tumbling down.\" Bramante, during his  residence in Lombardy, developed a method of erecting piers with  rubble enclosed by hewn stone or plaster-covered brickwork. This  enabled an unconscientious builder to furnish bulky architectural  masses, which presented a specious aspect of solidity and looked more  costly than they really were. It had the additional merit of being  easy and rapid in execution. Bramante was thus able to gratify the  whims and caprices of his impatient patron, who desired to see the  works of art he ordered rise like the fabric of Aladdin's lamp before  his very eyes. Michelangelo is said to have exposed the architect's  trickeries to the Pope; what is more, he complained with just and  bitter indignation of the wanton ruthlessness with which Bramante set  about his work of destruction. I will again quote Condivi here, for  the passage seems to have been inspired by the great sculptor's verbal  reminiscences: \"The worst was, that while he was pulling down the old  S. Peter's, he dashed those marvellous antique columns to the ground,  without paying the least attention, or caring at all when they were  broken into fragments, although he might have lowered them gently and  preserved their shafts intact. Michelangelo pointed out that it was an  easy thing enough to erect piers by placing brick on brick, but that  to fashion a column like one of these taxed all the resources of art.\"    On the 18th of April 1506, Julius performed the ceremony of laying the  foundation-stone of the new S. Peter's. The place chosen was the great  sustaining pier of the dome, near which the altar of S. Veronica now  stands. A deep pit had been excavated, into which the aged Pope  descended fearlessly, only shouting to the crowd above that they  should stand back and not endanger the falling in of the earth above  him. Coins and medals were duly deposited in a vase, over which a  ponderous block of marble was lowered, while Julius, bareheaded,  sprinkled the stone with holy water and gave the pontifical  benediction. On the same day he wrote a letter to Henry VII. of  England, informing the King that \"by the guidance of our Lord and  Saviour Jesus Christ he had undertaken to restore the old basilica  which was perishing through age.\"      V    The terms of cordial intimacy which subsisted between Julius and  Michelangelo at the close of 1505 were destined to be disturbed. The  Pope intermitted his visits to the sculptor's workshop, and began to  take but little interest in the monument. Condivi directly ascribes  this coldness to the intrigues of Bramante, who whispered into the  Pontiff's ear that it was ill-omened for a man to construct his own  tomb in his lifetime. It is not at all improbable that he said  something of the sort, and Bramante was certainly no good friend to  Michelangelo. A manoeuvring and managing individual, entirely  unscrupulous in his choice of means, condescending to flattery and  lies, he strove to stand as patron between the Pope and subordinate  craftsmen. Michelangelo had come to Rome under San Gallo's influence,  and Bramante had just succeeded in winning the commission to rebuild  S. Peter's over his rival's head. It was important for him to break up  San Gallo's party, among whom the sincere and uncompromising  Michelangelo threatened to be very formidable. The jealousy which he  felt for the man was envenomed by a fear lest he should speak the  truth about his own dishonesty. To discredit Michelangelo with the  Pope, and, if possible, to drive him out of Rome, was therefore  Bramante's interest: more particularly as his own nephew, Raffaello da  Urbino, had now made up his mind to join him there. We shall see that  he succeeded in expelling both San Gallo and Buonarroti during the  course of 1506, and that in their absence he reigned, together with  Raffaello, almost alone in the art-circles of the Eternal City.    I see no reason, therefore, to discredit the story told by Condivi and  Vasari regarding the Pope's growing want of interest in his tomb.  Michelangelo himself, writing from Rome in 1542, thirty-six years  after these events, says that \"all the dissensions between Pope Julius  and me arose from the envy of Bramante and Raffaello da Urbino, and  this"]]]
