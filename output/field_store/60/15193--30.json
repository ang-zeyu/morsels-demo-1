We should be willing  to look the situation fairly in the eye, divesting it of all those rose  colored dreams and fancies; then we should get right down to work.      NOT MANY RULES    \"If you get right down to the bottom, there are in reality not so many  singing rules to learn. You sing on the five vowels, and when you can  do them loudly, softly, and with mezzo voce, you have a foundation upon  which to build vocal mastery. And yet some people study eight, ten years  without really laying the foundation. Why should it take the singer such  a long time to master the material of his equipment? A lawyer or doctor,  after leaving college, devotes three or four years only to preparing  himself for his profession, receives his diploma, then sets up in  business. It ought not to be so much more difficult to learn to sing  than to learn these other professions.      THE EAR    \"Of course the ear is the most important factor, our greatest ally. It  helps us imitate. Imitation forms a large part of our study. We hear a  beautiful tone; we try to imitate it; we try in various ways, with  various placements, until we succeed in producing the sound we have been  seeking. Then we endeavor to remember the sensations experienced in  order that we may repeat the tone at will. So you see Listening,  Imitation and Memory are very important factors in the student's  development.      BEL CANTO    \"I have just spoken of a beautiful tone. The old Italian operas  cultivate the _bel canto_, that is--beautiful singing. Of course it is  well for the singer to cultivate this first of all, for it is excellent,  and necessary for the voice. But modern Italian opera portrays the real  men and women of to-day, who live, enjoy, suffer, are angry and  repentant. _Bel canto_ will not express these emotions. When a man is  jealous or in a rage, he will not stand quietly in the middle of the  stage and sing beautiful tones. He does not think of beautiful tones at  all. Hatred and jealousy should be expressed in the voice as well as in  action and gesture; they are far from lovely in themselves, and to be  natural and true to life, they will not make lovely tones in the voice.  We want singing actors to-day, men and women who can adequately portray  the characters they impersonate through both voice and action.      LEARNING A ROLE    \"In taking up a new part I vocalize the theme first, to get an idea of  the music; then I learn the words. After this I work with the  accompanist who comes to me every morning. Of course, besides this, I do  daily vocalizes and vocal exercises; one must always keep up one's  vocal technic.    \"But learning words and music is only a part of the work to be done on a  role. It must then be interpreted; more than this it must be visualized.  This part of the work rests largely with the singer, and gives  opportunity for his individuality to assert itself. Of course the  general idea of the characterization is given us, the make-up, posturing  and so on. To work out these ideas, to make the part our own, to feel at  home in it, so that it shall not seem like acting, but appear perfectly  natural--all this takes a great deal of thought, time and study. It is  all a mental process, as every one knows; we must project our thought  out to the audience, we must 'get it over,' or it will never strike  fire!\"      INTERPRETATION    On the subject of individuality in interpretation, Mr. Johnson was  convincing. \"I feel that if I have worked out a characterization, I must  stick to my idea, in spite of what others say. It is my own conception,  and I must either stand or fall by it. At times I have tried to follow  the suggestions of this or that critic and have changed my  interpretation to suit their taste. But it always rendered me self  conscious, made my work unnatural and caused me speedily to return to my  own conception.      LEARNING BY DOING    \"The singer finds the stage a great teacher. Before the footlights he  has constant opportunity to try out this or that effect, to note which  placement of the voice best fits the tones he wishes to produce. Then,  too, he soon learns to feel whether he has made the impression he had  hoped, whether he has the audience with him. If he cannot win the  audience, he takes careful thought to see why. In order to win his  hearers, to get his work across the footlights, there are certain things  he must have, virtues he must possess. For instance,\"--and the artist  counted them off on his finger tips,--\"he must have Accent, Diction,  Characterization, and above all, Sincerity. No matter what other good  qualities he may possess, he must be sincere before anything else. If he  lack this the audience soon finds it out. There's nothing that wins its  way like the grace of sincerity. You see I give prominent place to  accent and diction. Whatever fault the critics found with me, they have  always conceded to me both these virtues.    \"But time passes and soon the work of the night will begin. I trust that  our informal conference may contain a few points of personal experience  which may be helpful to those who are striving to enter the field of  opera.\" And with his pleasant smile and genial greeting, Mr. Johnson  closed the conference.          XVIII    =REINALD WERRENRATH=    ACHIEVING SUCCESS ON THE CONCERT STAGE      At the close of a recital by Reinald Werrenrath, the listener feels he  has something to carry away, a tangible impression, a real message. What  is the impression--can it be defined? Perhaps it is more the complete  effect as a whole that makes the deepest impression. The voice is always  agreeable, the diction so clear and distinct that every syllable can be  followed from the topmost corner of Carnegie Hall, so there is no need  to print a program book for this singer. Different qualities of voice  render the picture or mood more vivid, and all is accomplished with  perfect ease, in itself a charm. People settle in their seats as if  certain that a song recital by Werrenrath is sure to bring enjoyment and  satisfaction.    And Mr. Werrenrath has proven, through season after season of concert  giving in America, that he is filling his own special niche in the  scheme of the country's musical life; that he has his own message of  the beautiful--the natural--in vocal art to deliver to the people all  over the land, and he is accomplishing this with ever increasing ability  and success.    To go through a season filled with concert tours, such as a popular  singer has laid out for him, means so many weeks and months of strenuous  toil and travel. There may be a few brief hours or days here and there,  when he can be at home among family and friends; but soon he is off  again--\"on the road.\"    Mr. Werrenrath is the sort of singer who is generally on the wing, or if  not exactly that, is so rushed with work, record making and rehearsing  for occasional opera appearances, that it is very difficult to get a  word with him. I was exceedingly fortunate however, one day recently, to  catch a glimpse of him between a Metropolitan rehearsal on the one hand,  and some concert business on the other. He entered the room where I  waited, tall, vigorous, his fine face lighted by a rapid walk in the  fresh air; he seemed the embodiment of mental vigor and alertness.      VOCAL CONTROL    [Illustration: REINALD WERRENRATH]    I plunged at once into the subject I had come for, telling him I wanted  to know how he had worked to bring about such results as were noted in  his recent recital in Carnegie Hall; in what way he had studied, and  what, in his opinion, were the most important factors, from an  educational point of view, for the young singer to consider.    \"That is entirely too difficult a question to be answered briefly, even  in a half hour, or in an hour's talk. There are too many angles;\" his  clear gray eyes looked at me frankly as he spoke. \"Voice culture, voice  mastery, what is it? It is having control of your instrument to such an  extent that you put it out of your thought completely when you sing. The  voice is your servant and must do your bidding. This control is arrived  at through a variety of means, and can be considered from a thousand  angles, any one of which would be interesting to follow up. I have been  on the concert stage for nearly a score of years, and ought to know  whereof I speak; yet I can say I have not learned it all even now, not  by any means. Vocal technic is something on which you are always  working, something which is never completed, something which is  constantly improving with your mental growth and experience--if you are  working along the right lines. People talk of finishing their vocal  technic; how can that ever be done? You are always learning how to do  better. If you don't make the effect you expected to, in a certain  place, when singing in public, you take thought of it afterward,  consider what was the matter, _why_ you couldn't put it over--why it had  no effect on the audience. Then you work on it, learn how to correct and  improve it.      EARLY EXPERIENCES    \"As you may know, my father was a great singer; he was my first teacher.  After I lost him I studied for several years with Dr. Carl Duft and  later with Arthur Mees. In all this time I had learned a great deal  about music from the intellectual and emotional sides, music in the  abstract and so on. In fact, I thought I knew about all there was to be  learned about the art of song; I settled back on my oars and let the  matter go at that. At last, however, I awoke to see that I didn't know  it all yet; I discovered I couldn't put the feeling and emotion which  surged within me across to others in the way I wanted to--in the way  which could move and impress them; I could not make the effects I  wanted; I was getting into a rut. This was seven years ago. At that time  I went to Percy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#20)"],[1,"prohibitive owing to the losses they entail.    During the exigencies of the heavy fighting which ended in the last week  of November the French and British forces had become somewhat mixed up,  entailing a certain amount of difficulty in matters of supply and in  securing unity of command.    By the end of November I was able to concentrate the army under my  command in one area, and, by holding a shorter line, to establish  effective reserves.    By the beginning of December there was a considerable falling off in  the volume of artillery fire directed against our front by the enemy.  Reconnoissance and reports showed that a certain amount of artillery had  been withdrawn. We judged that the cavalry in our front, with the  exception of one division of the Guard, had disappeared.    There did not, however, appear to have been any great diminution in the  numbers of infantry holding the trenches.    3. Although both artillery and rifle fire were exchanged with the enemy  every day, and sniping went on more or less continuously during the  hours of daylight, the operations which call for special record or  comment are comparatively few.    During the last week in November some successful minor night operations  were carried out in the Fourth Corps.    On the night of Nov. 23-24 a small party of the Second Lincolnshire  Regiment, under Lieut. E.H. Impey, cleared three of the enemy's advanced  trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth Brigade, and withdrew without loss.    On the night of the 24th-25th Capt. J.R. Minshull Ford, Royal Welsh  Fusiliers, and Lieut. E.L. Morris, Royal Engineers, with fifteen men of  the Royal Engineers and Royal Welsh Fusiliers, successfully mined and  blew up a group of farms immediately in front of the German trenches on  the Touquet-Bridoux Road which had been used by German snipers.    On the night of Nov. 26-27 a small party of the Second Scots Guards,  under Lieut. Sir E.H.W. Hulse, Bart., rushed the trenches opposite the  Twentieth Brigade, and after pouring a heavy fire into them returned  with useful information as to the strength of the Germans and the  position of machine guns.    The trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth Brigade were rushed the same  night by a patrol of the Second Rifle Brigade, under Lieut. E. Durham.    On Nov. 23 the One Hundred and Twelfth Regiment of the Fourteenth German  Army Corps succeeded in capturing some 800 yards of the trenches held by  the Indian Corps, but the general officer commanding the Meerut Division  organized a powerful counter-attack, which lasted throughout the night.  At daybreak on Nov. 24 the line was entirely re-established.    The operation was a costly one, involving many casualties, but the enemy  suffered far more heavily.    We captured over 100 prisoners, including 3 officers, as well as 3  machine guns and two trench mortars.    On Dec. 7 the concentration of the Indian Corps was completed by the  arrival of the Sirhind Brigade from Egypt.    On Dec. 9 the enemy attempted to commence a strong attack against the  Third Corps, particularly in front of the trenches held by the Argyll  and Sutherland Highlanders and the Middlesex Regiment.    They were driven back with heavy loss, and did not renew the attempt.  Our casualties were very slight.    During the early days of December certain indications along the whole  front of the allied line induced the French commanders and myself to  believe that the enemy had withdrawn considerable forces from the  western theatre.    Arrangements were made with the commander of the Eighth French Army for  an attack to be commenced on the morning of Dec. 14.    Operations began at 7 A.M. by a combined heavy artillery bombardment by  the two French and the Second British Corps.    The British objectives were the Petit Bois and the Maedelsteed Spur,  lying respectively to the west and the southwest of the village of  Wytschaete.    At 7:45 A.M. the Royal Scots, with great dash, rushed forward and  attacked the former, while the Gordon Highlanders attacked the latter  place.    The Royal Scots, commanded by Major F.J. Duncan, D.S.O., in face of a  terrible machine gun and rifle fire, carried the German trench on the  west edge of the Petit Bois, capturing two machine guns and fifty-three  prisoners, including one officer.    The Gordon Highlanders, with great gallantry, advanced up the  Maedelsteed Spur, forcing the enemy to evacuate their front trench. They  were, however, losing heavily, and found themselves unable to get any  further. At nightfall they were obliged to fall back to their original  position.    Capt. C. Boddam-Whetham and Lieut. W.F.R. Dobie showed splendid dash,  and with a few men entered the enemy's leading trenches; but they were  all either killed or captured.    Lieut. G.R.V. Hume-Gare and Lieut. W.H. Paterson also distinguished  themselves by their gallant leading.    Although not successful, the operation was most creditable to the  fighting spirit of the Gordon Highlanders, most ably commanded by Major  A.W.F. Baird, D.S.O.    As the Thirty-second French Division on the left had been unable to make  any progress, the further advance of our infantry into the Wytschaete  Wood was not practicable.    Possession of the western edge of the Petit Bois was, however, retained.    The ground was devoid of cover and so water-logged that a rapid advance  was impossible, the men sinking deep in the mud at every step they took.    The artillery throughout the day was very skillfully handled by the  C.A.R.A.'s of the Fourth and Fifth Divisions--Major Gen. F.D.V. Wing,  C.B.; Brig. Gen. G.F. Milne, C.B., D.S.O., and Brig. Gen. J.E.W.  Headlam, C.B., D.S.O.    The casualties during the day were about 17 officers and 407 other  ranks. The losses of the enemy were very considerable, large numbers of  dead being found in the Petit Bois and also in the communicating  trenches in front of the Gordon Highlanders, in one of which a hundred  were counted by a night patrol.    On this day the artillery of the Fourth Division, Third Corps, was used  in support of the attack, under orders of the General Officer Commanding  Second Corps.    The remainder of the Third Corps made demonstrations against the enemy  with a view to preventing him from detaching troops to the area of  operations of the Second Corps.    From Dec. 15 to 17 the offensive operations which were commenced on the  14th were continued, but were confined chiefly to artillery bombardment.    The infantry advance against Wytschaete Wood was not practicable until  the French on our left could make some progress to afford protection to  that flank.    On the 17th it was agreed that the plan of attack as arranged should be  modified; but I was requested to continue demonstrations along my line  in order to assist and support certain French operations which were  being conducted elsewhere.    4. In his desire to act with energy up to his instructions to  demonstrate and occupy the enemy, the General Officer Commanding the  Indian Corps decided to take the advantage of what appeared to him a  favorable opportunity to launch attacks against the advanced trenches in  his front on Dec. 18 and 19.    The attack of the Meerut Division on the left was made on the morning of  the 19th with energy and determination, and was at first attended with  considerable success, the enemy's advanced trenches being captured.  Later on, however, a counter-attack drove them back to their original  position with considerable loss.    The attack of the Lahore Division commenced at 4:30 A.M. It was carried  out by two companies each of the First Highland Light Infantry and the  First Battalion, Fourth Gurkha Rifles of the Sirhind Brigade, under  Lieut. Col. R.W.H. Ronaldson. This attack was completely successful, two  lines of the enemy's trenches being captured with little loss.    Before daylight the captured trenches were filled with as many men as  they could hold. The front was very restricted, communication to the  rear impossible.    At daybreak it was found that the position was practically untenable.  Both flanks were in the air, and a supporting attack, which was late in  starting, and, therefore, conducted during daylight, failed, although  attempted with the greatest gallantry and resolution.    Lieut. Col. Ronaldson held on till dusk, when the whole of the captured  trenches had to be evacuated, and the detachment fell back to its  original line.    By the night of Dec. 19 nearly all the ground gained during the day had  been lost.    From daylight on Dec. 20 the enemy commenced a heavy fire from artillery  and trench mortars on the whole front of the Indian Corps. This was  followed by infantry attacks, which were in especial force against  Givenchy, and between that place and La Quinque Rue.    At about 10 A.M. the enemy succeeded in driving back the Sirhind Brigade  and capturing a considerable part of Givenchy, but the Fifty-seventh  Rifles and Ninth Bhopals, north of the canal, and the Connaught Rangers,  south of it, stood firm.    The Fifteenth Sikhs of the Divisional Reserve were already supporting  the Sirhind Brigade. On the news of the retirement of the latter being  received, the Forty-seventh Sikhs were also sent up to reinforce Gen.  Brunker. The First Manchester Regiment, Fourth Suffolk Regiment, and two  battalions of French territorials under Gen. Carnegy were ordered to  launch a vigorous counter-attack to retake by a flank attack the  trenches lost by the Sirhind Brigade.    Orders were sent to Gen. Carnegy to divert his attack on Givenchy  village, and to re-establish the situation there.    A battalion of the Fifty-eighth French Division was sent to Annequin in  support.    About 5 P.M. a gallant attack by the First Manchester Regiment and one  company of the Fourth Suffolk Regiment had captured Givenchy, and had  cleared the enemy out of the two lines of trenches to the northeast.
