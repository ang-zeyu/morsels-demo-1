Charlotte, who was not altogether  of his opinion, remarked this temper in him, and jested with him about  it--he who had always the sharpest thing to say on departed visitors,  was this evening so gentle and tolerant.    With fervor and heartfelt conviction, Edward cried, \"One has only to  love a single creature with all one's heart, and the whole world at once  looks lovely!\"    Ottilie dropped her eyes on the ground, and Charlotte looked straight  before her.    The Captain took up the word, and said, \"It is the same with deep  feelings of respect and reverence: we first learn to recognize what  there is that is to be valued in the world, when we find occasion to  entertain such sentiments toward a particular object.\"    Charlotte made an excuse to retire early to her room where she could  give herself up to thinking over what had passed in the course of the  evening between herself and the Captain.    When Edward sprang on shore, and, pushing off the boat, had himself  committed his wife and his friend to the uncertain element, Charlotte  found herself face to face with the man on whose account she had been  already secretly suffering so bitterly, sitting in the twilight before  her, and sweeping along the boat with the sculls in easy motion. She  felt a depth of sadness, very rare with her, weighing on her spirits.  The undulating movement of the boat, the splash of the oars, the faint  breeze playing over the watery mirror, the sighing of the reeds, the  long flight of the birds, the fitful twinkling of the first stars--there  was something spectral about it all in the universal stillness. She  fancied her friend was bearing her away to set her on some far-off  shore, and leave her there alone; strange emotions were passing through  her, and she could not give way to them and weep.    The Captain was describing to her the manner in which, in his opinion,  the improvements should be continued. He praised the construction of the  boat; it was so convenient, he said, because one person could so easily  manage it with a pair of oars. She should herself learn how to do this;  there was often a delicious feeling in floating along alone upon the  water, one's own ferryman and steersman.    The parting which was impending sank on Charlotte's heart as he was  speaking. Is he saying this on purpose? she thought to herself. Does he  know it yet? Does he suspect it or is it only accident? And is he  unconsciously foretelling me my fate?    A weary, impatient heaviness took hold of her; she begged him to make  for land as soon as possible and return with her to the castle.    It was the first time that the Captain had been upon the water, and,  though generally he had acquainted himself with its depth, he did not  know accurately the particular spots. Dusk was coming on; he directed  his course to a place where he thought it would be easy to get on shore,  and from which he knew the footpath which led to the castle was not far  distant. Charlotte, however, repeated her wish to get to land quickly,  and the place which he thought of being at a short distance, he gave it  up, and exerting himself as much as he possibly could, made straight for  the bank. Unhappily the water was shallow, and he ran aground some way  off from it. From the rate at which he was going the boat was fixed  fast, and all his efforts to move it were in vain. What was to be done?  There was no alternative but to get into the water and carry his  companion ashore.    It was done without difficulty or danger. He was strong enough not to  totter with her, or give her any cause for anxiety; but in her agitation  she had thrown her arms about his neck. He held her fast, and pressed  her to himself--and at last laid her down upon a grassy bank, not  without emotion and confusion * * * she still lay upon his neck * * * he  caught her up once more in his arms, and pressed a warm kiss upon her  lips. The next moment he was at her feet: he took her hand, and held it  to his mouth, and cried:    \"Charlotte, will you forgive me?\"    The kiss which he had ventured to give, and which she had all but  returned to him, brought Charlotte to herself again--she pressed his  hand--but she did not attempt to raise him up. She bent down over him,  and laid her hand upon his shoulder and said:    \"We cannot now prevent this moment from forming an epoch in our lives;  but it depends on us to bear ourselves in a manner which shall be worthy  of us. You must go away, my dear friend; and you are going. The Count  has plans for you, to give you better prospects--I am glad, and I am  sorry. I did not mean to speak of it till it was certain but this moment  obliges me to tell you my secret * * * Since it does not depend on  ourselves to alter our feelings, I can only forgive you, I can only  forgive myself, if we have the courage to alter our situation.\" She  raised him up, took his arm to support herself, and they walked back to  the castle without speaking.    But now she was standing in her own room, where she had to feel and to  know that she was Edward's wife. Her strength and the various discipline  in which through life she had trained herself, came to her assistance in  the conflict. Accustomed as she had always been to look steadily into  herself and to control herself, she did not now find it difficult, with  an earnest effort, to come to the resolution which she desired. She  could almost smile when she remembered the strange visit of the night  before. Suddenly she was seized with a wonderful instinctive feeling, a  thrill of fearful delight which changed into holy hope and longing. She  knelt earnestly down, and repeated the oath which she had taken to  Edward before the altar.    Friendship, affection, renunciation, floated in glad, happy images  before her. She felt restored to health and to herself. A sweet  weariness came over her. She lay down, and sank into a calm, quiet  sleep.          CHAPTER XIII      Edward, on his part, was in a very different temper. So little he  thought of sleeping that it did not once occur to him even to undress  himself. A thousand times he kissed the transcript of the document, but  it was the beginning of it, in Ottilie's childish, timid hand; the end  he scarcely dared to kiss, for he thought it was his own hand which he  saw. Oh, that it were another document! he whispered to himself; and, as  it was, he felt it was the sweetest assurance that his highest wish  would be fulfilled. Thus it remained in his hands, thus he continued to  press it to his heart, although disfigured by a third name subscribed to  it. The waning moon rose up over the wood. The warmth of the night drew  Edward out into the free air. He wandered this way and that way; he was  at once the most restless and the happiest of mortals. He strayed  through the gardens--they seemed too narrow for him; he hurried out  into the park, and it was too wide. He was drawn back toward the castle;  he stood under Ottilie's window. He threw himself down on the steps of  the terrace below. \"Walls and bolts,\" he said to himself, \"may still  divide us, but our hearts are not divided. If she were here before me,  into my arms she would fall, and I into hers; and what can one desire  but that sweet certainty!\" All was stillness round him; not a breath was  moving;--so still it was, that he could hear the unresting creatures  underground at their work, to whom day or night are alike. He abandoned  himself to his delicious dreams; at last he fell asleep, and did not  wake till the sun with his royal beams was mounting up in the sky and  scattering the early mists.    He found himself the first person awake on his domain. The laborers  seemed to be staying away too long: they came; he thought they were too  few, and the work set out for the day too slight for his desires. He  inquired for more workmen; they were promised, and in the course of the  day they came. But these, too, were not enough for him to carry his  plans out as rapidly as he wished. To do the work gave him no pleasure  any longer; it should all be done. And for whom? The paths should be  gravelled that Ottilie might walk presently upon them; seats should be  made at every spot and corner that Ottilie might rest on them. The new  park house was hurried forward. It should be finished for Ottilie's  birthday. In all he thought and all he did, there was no more  moderation. The sense of loving and of being loved, urged him out into  the unlimited. How changed was now to him the look of all the rooms,  their furniture, and their decorations! He did not feel as if he was in  his own house any more. Ottilie's presence absorbed everything. He was  utterly lost in her; no other thought ever rose before him; no  conscience disturbed him; every restraint which had been laid upon his  nature burst loose. His whole being centered upon Ottilie. This  impetuosity of passion did not escape the Captain, who longed, if he  could, to prevent its evil consequences. All those plans which were now  being hurried on with this immoderate speed, had been drawn out and  calculated for a long, quiet, easy execution. The sale of the farm had  been completed; the first instalment had been paid. Charlotte, according  to the arrangement, had taken possession of it. But the very first week  after, she found it more than usually necessary to exercise patience and  resolution, and to keep her eye on what was being done. In the present  hasty style of proceeding, the money which had been set apart for the  purpose would not go far.    Much had been begun, and much yet remained to be done. How could the  Captain leave Charlotte in such a situation? They consulted together,  and agreed that it would be better that they themselves should hurry on  the works, and for this purpose employ money which could be made good  again at the period fixed for the discharge of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#20)"],[1," of the  imperial family, though this did not mean that rivalries came to an end.    On the whole Wen Ti's period of rule passed in comparative peace. For  the first time since the beginning of Chinese history, great areas of  continuous territory were under unified rule, without unending internal  warfare such as had existed under Shih Huang-ti and Kao Tsu. The  creation of so extensive a region of peace produced great economic  advance. The burdens that had lain on the peasant population were  reduced, especially since under Wen Ti the court was very frugal. The  population grew and cultivated fresh land, so that production increased  and with it the exchange of goods. The most outstanding sign of this was  the abandonment of restrictions on the minting of copper coin, in order  to prevent deflation through insufficiency of payment media. As a  consequence more taxes were brought in, partly in kind, partly in coin,  and this increased the power of the central government. The new gentry  streamed into the towns, their standard of living rose, and they made  themselves more and more into a class apart from the general population.  As people free from material cares, they were able to devote themselves  to scholarship. They went back to the old writings and studied them once  more. They even began to identify themselves with the nobles of feudal  times, to adopt the rules of good behaviour and the ceremonial described  in the Confucianist books, and very gradually, as time went on, to make  these their textbooks of good form. From this point the Confucianist  ideals first began to penetrate the official class recruited from the  gentry, and then the state organization itself. It was expected that an  official should be versed in Confucianism, and schools were set up for  Confucianist education. Around 100 B.C. this led to the introduction of  the examination system, which gradually became the one method of  selection of new officials. The system underwent many changes, but  remained in operation in principle until 1904. The object of the  examinations was not to test job efficiency but command of the ideals of  the gentry and knowledge of the literature inculcating them: this was  regarded as sufficient qualification for any position in the service of  the state.    In theory this path to training of character and to admission to the  state service was open to every \"respectable\" citizen. Of the  traditional four \"classes\" of Chinese society, only the first two,  officials (_shih_) and farmers (_nung_) were always regarded as fully  \"respectable\" (_liang-min_). Members of the other two classes, artisans  (_kung_) and merchants (_shang_), were under numerous restrictions.  Below these were classes of \"lowly people\" (_ch'ien-min_) and below  these the slaves which were not part of society proper. The privileges  and obligations of these categories were soon legally fixed. In  practice, during the first thousand years of the existence of the  examination system no peasant had a chance to become an official by  means of the examinations. In the Han period the provincial officials  had to propose suitable young persons for examination, and so for  admission to the state service, as was already mentioned. In addition,  schools had been instituted for the sons of officials; it is interesting  to note that there were, again and again, complaints about the low level  of instruction in these schools. Nevertheless, through these schools all  sons of officials, whatever their capacity or lack of capacity, could  become officials in their turn. In spite of its weaknesses, the system  had its good side. It inoculated a class of people with ideals that were  unquestionably of high ethical value. The Confucian moral system gave a  Chinese official or any member of the gentry a spiritual attitude and an  outward bearing which in their best representatives has always commanded  respect, an integrity that has always preserved its possessors, and in  consequence Chinese society as a whole, from moral collapse, from  spiritual nihilism, and has thus contributed to the preservation of  Chinese cultural values in spite of all foreign conquerors.    In the time of Wen Ti and especially of his successors, the revival at  court of the Confucianist ritual and of the earlier Heaven-worship  proceeded steadily. The sacrifices supposed to have been performed in  ancient times, the ritual supposed to have been prescribed for the  emperor in the past, all this was reintroduced. Obviously much of it was  spurious: much of the old texts had been lost, and when fragments were  found they were arbitrarily completed. Moreover, the old writing was  difficult to read and difficult to understand; thus various things were  read into the texts without justification. The new Confucians who came  forward as experts in the moral code were very different men from their  predecessors; above all, like all their contemporaries, they were  strongly influenced by the shamanistic magic that had developed in the  Ch'in period.    Wen Ti's reign had brought economic advance and prosperity;  intellectually it had been a period of renaissance, but like every such  period it did not simply resuscitate what was old, but filled the  ancient moulds with an entirely new content. Socially the period had  witnessed the consolidation of the new upper class, the gentry, who  copied the mode of life of the old nobility. This is seen most clearly  in the field of law. In the time of the Legalists the first steps had  been taken in the codification of the criminal law. They clearly  intended these laws to serve equally for all classes of the people. The  Ch'in code which was supposedly Li K'uei's code, was used in the Han  period, and was extensively elaborated by Siao Ho (died 193 B.C.) and  others. This code consisted of two volumes of the chief laws for grave  cases, one of mixed laws for the less serious cases, and six volumes on  the imposition of penalties. In the Han period \"decisions\" were added,  so that about A.D. 200 the code had grown to 26,272 paragraphs with over  17,000,000 words. The collection then consisted of 960 volumes. This  colossal code has been continually revised, abbreviated, or expanded,  and under its last name of \"Collected Statues of the Manchu Dynasty\" it  retained its validity down to the present century.    Alongside this collection there was another book that came to be  regarded and used as a book of precedences. The great Confucianist  philosopher Tung Chung-shu (179-104 B.C.), a firm supporter of the  ideology of the new gentry class, declared that the classic Confucianist  writings, and especially the book _Ch'un-ch'iu_, \"Annals of Spring and  Autumn\", attributed to Confucius himself, were essentially books of  legal decisions. They contained \"cases\" and Confucius's decisions of  them. Consequently any case at law that might arise could be decided by  analogy with the cases contained in \"Annals of Spring and Autumn\". Only  an educated person, of course, a member of the gentry, could claim that  his action should be judged by the decisions of Confucius and not by the  code compiled for the common people, for Confucius had expressly stated  that his rules were intended only for the upper class. Thus, right down  to modern times an educated person could be judged under regulations  different from those applicable to the common people, or if judged on  the basis of the laws, he had to expect a special treatment. The  principle of the \"equality before the law\" which the Legalists had  advocated and which fitted well into the absolutistic, totalitarian  system of the Ch'in, had been attacked by the feudal nobility at that  time and was attacked by the new gentry of the Han time. Legalist  thinking remained an important undercurrent for many centuries to come,  but application of the equalitarian principle was from now on never  seriously considered.    Against the growing influence of the officials belonging to the gentry  there came a last reaction. It came as a reply to the attempt of a  representative of the gentry to deprive the feudal princes of the whole  of their power. In the time of Wen Ti's successor a number of feudal  kings formed an alliance against the emperor, and even invited the  Hsiung-nu to join them. The Hsiung-nu did not do so, because they saw  that the rising had no prospect of success, and it was quelled. After  that the feudal princes were steadily deprived of rights. They were  divided into two classes, and only privileged ones were permitted to  live in the capital, the others being required to remain in their  domains. At first, the area was controlled by a \"minister\" of the  prince, an official of the state; later the area remained under normal  administration and the feudal prince kept only an empty title; the tax  income of a certain number of families of an area was assigned to him  and transmitted to him by normal administrative channels. Often, the  number of assigned families was fictional in that the actual income was  from far fewer families. This system differs from the Near Eastern  system in which also no actual enforcement took place, but where  deserving men were granted the right to collect themselves the taxes of  a certain area with certain numbers of families.    Soon after this the whole government was given the shape which it  continued to have until A.D. 220, and which formed the point of  departure for all later forms of government. At the head of the state  was the emperor, in theory the holder of absolute power in the state  restricted only by his responsibility towards \"Heaven\", i.e. he had to  follow and to enforce the basic rules of morality, otherwise \"Heaven\"  would withdraw its \"mandate\", the legitimation of the emperor's rule,  and would indicate this withdrawal by sending natural catastrophes.
