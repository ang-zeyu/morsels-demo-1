We  should have thought of Sevenbergen before, instead of wasting our time  hunting all the odd corners of Tergou for those cursed parchments that  we shall never find till we find the man that took 'em. If he was at  Sevenbergen,' quoth I, 'and they sent the dwarf to him, it must have  been to warn him we are after him. He is leagues away by now,' quoth I.  Confound that chalk-faced girl! she has outwitted us bearded men; and  so I told the burgomaster, but he would not hear reason. A wet jerkin  apiece, that is all we shall get, mates, by this job.\"    Martin grinned coolly in Dierich's face.    \"However,\" added the latter, \"to content the burgomaster, we will search  the house.\"    Martin turned grave directly.    This change of countenance did not escape Dierich. He reflected a  moment.    \"Watch outside two of you, one on each side of the house, that no one  jump from the upper windows. The rest come with me.\"    And he took the candle and mounted the stairs, followed by three of his  comrades.    Martin was left alone.    The stout soldier hung his head. All had gone so well at first; and now  this fatal turn! Suddenly it occurred to him that all was not yet lost.  Gerard must be either in Peter's room or Margaret's; they were not so  very high from the ground. Gerard would leap out. Dierich had left a man  below; but what then? For half a minute Gerard and he would be two to  one, and in that brief space, what might not be done?    Martin then held the back door ajar and watched. The light shone in  Peter's room. \"Curse the fool!\" said he, \"is he going to let them take  him like a girl?\"    The light now passed into Margaret's bedroom. Still no window was  opened. Had Gerard intended to escape that way, he would not have waited  till the men were in the room. Martin saw that at once, and left the  door, and came to the foot-stair and listened.    He began to think Gerard must have escaped by the window while all the  men were in the house. The longer the silence continued, the stronger  grew this conviction. But it was suddenly and rudely dissipated.    Faint cries issued from the inner bedroom--Margaret's.    \"They have taken him,\" groaned Martin; \"they have got him.\"    It now flashed across Martin's mind that if they took Gerard away, his  life was not worth a button; and that, if evil befell him, Margaret's  heart would break. He cast his eyes wildly round like some savage beast  seeking an escape, and in a twinkling formed a resolution terribly  characteristic of those iron times and of a soldier driven to bay. He  stepped to each door in turn, and imitating Dierich Brower's voice,  said sharply, \"Watch the window!\" He then quietly closed and bolted  both doors. He then took up his bow and six arrows; one he fitted to his  string, the others he put into his quiver. His knife he placed upon a  chair behind him, the hilt towards him; and there he waited at the foot  of the stair with the calm determination to slay those four men, or be  slain by them. Two, he knew, he could dispose of by his arrows, ere  they could get near him, and Gerard and he must take their chance  hand-to-hand with the remaining pair. Besides, he had seen men  panic-stricken by a sudden attack of this sort. Should Brower and his  men hesitate but an instant before closing with him, he should shoot  three instead of two, and then the odds would be on the right side.    He had not long to wait. The heavy steps sounded in Margaret's room, and  came nearer and nearer.    The light also approached, and voices.    Martin's heart, stout as it was, beat hard, to hear men coming thus to  their death, and perhaps to his; more likely so than not: for four is  long odds in a battlefield of ten feet square, and Gerard might be bound  perhaps, and powerless to help. But this man, whom we have seen shake in  his shoes at a Giles-o'-lanthorn, never wavered in this awful moment of  real danger, but stood there, his body all braced for combat, and his  eye glowing, equally ready to take life and lose it. Desperate game! to  win which was exile instant and for life, and to lose it was to die that  moment upon that floor he stood on.      Dierich Brower and his men found Peter in his first sleep. They opened  his cupboards, they ran their knives into an alligator he had nailed to  his wall; they looked under his bed: it was a large room, and apparently  full of hiding-places, but they found no Gerard.    Then they went on to Margaret's room, and the very sight of it was  discouraging--it was small and bare, and not a cupboard in it; there  was, however, a large fireplace and chimney. Dierich's eye fell on these  directly. Here they found the beauty of Sevenbergen sleeping on an old  chest not a foot high, and no attempt made to cover it; but the sheets  were snowy white, and so was Margaret's own linen. And there she lay,  looking like a lily fallen into a rut.    Presently she awoke, and sat up in the bed, like one amazed; then,  seeing the men, began to scream faintly, and pray for mercy.    She made Dierich Brower ashamed of his errand.    \"Here is a to-do,\" said he, a little confused. \"We are not going to hurt  you, my pretty maid. Lie you still, and shut your eyes, and think of  your wedding-night, while I look up this chimney to see if Master Gerard  is there.\"    \"Gerard! in my room?\"    \"Why not? They say that you and he--\"    \"Cruel! you know they have driven him away from me--driven him from his  native place. This is a blind. You are thieves; you are wicked men; you  are not men of Sevenbergen, or you would know Margaret Brandt better  than to look for her lover in this room of all others in the world. Oh,  brave! Four great hulking men to come, armed to the teeth, to insult one  poor honest girl! The women that live in your own houses must be naught,  or you would respect them too much to insult a girl of good character.\"    \"There! come away, before we hear worse,\" said Dierich hastily. \"He  is not in the chimney. Plaster will mend what a cudgel breaks; but a  woman's tongue is a double-edged dagger, and a girl is a woman with her  mother's milk still in her.\" And he beat a hasty retreat. \"I told the  burgomaster how 'twould be.\"        CHAPTER XV    Where is the woman that cannot act a part? Where is she who will not  do it, and do it well, to save the man she loves? Nature on these great  occasions comes to the aid of the simplest of the sex, and teaches her  to throw dust in Solomon's eyes. The men had no sooner retired than  Margaret stepped out of bed, and opened the long chest on which she had  been lying down in her skirt and petticoat and stockings, and nightdress  over all; and put the lid, bed-clothes and all, against the wall: then  glided to the door and listened. The footsteps died away through her  father's room and down the stairs.    Now in that chest there was a peculiarity that it was almost impossible  for a stranger to detect. A part of the boarding of the room had been  broken, and Gerard being applied to to make it look neater, and being  short of materials, had ingeniously sawed away a space sufficient just  to admit Margaret's soi-disant bed, and with the materials thus acquired  he had repaired the whole room. As for the bed or chest, it really  rested on the rafters a foot below the boards. Consequently it was full  two feet deep, though it looked scarce one.    All was quiet. Margaret kneeled and gave thanks to Heaven. Then she  glided from the door and leaned over the chest, and whispered tenderly,  \"Gerard!\"    Gerard did not reply.    She then whispered a little louder, \"Gerard, all is safe, thank Heaven!  You may rise; but oh! be cautious!\"    Gerard made no reply.    She laid her hand upon his shoulder--\"Gerard!\"    No reply.    \"Oh, what is this?\" she cried, and her hands ran wildly over his face  and his bosom. She took him by the shoulders; she shook him; she lifted  him; but he escaped from her trembling hands, and fell back, not like a  man, but like a body. A great dread fell on her. The lid had been down.  She had lain upon it. The men had been some time in the room. With all  the strength of frenzy she tore him out of the chest. She bore him in  her arms to the window. She dashed the window open. The sweet air came  in. She laid him in it and in the moonlight. His face was the colour of  ashes; his body was all limp and motionless. She felt his heart. Horror!  it was as still as the rest! Horror of horrors! she had stifled him with  her own body.    The mind cannot all at once believe so great and sudden and strange a  calamity. Gerard, who had got alive into that chest scarce five minutes  ago, how could he be dead?    She called him by all the endearing names that heart could think or  tongue could frame. She kissed him and fondled him and coaxed him and  implored him to speak to her.    No answer to words of love, such as she had never uttered to him before,  nor thought she could utter. Then the poor creature, trembling all over,  began to say over that ashy face little foolish things that were at once  terrible and pitiable.    \"Oh, Gerard! I am very sorry you are dead. I am very sorry I have killed  you. Forgive me for not letting the men take you; it would have been  better than this. Oh, Gerard! I am very, very sorry for what I have  done.\" Then she began suddenly to rave.    \"No! no! such things can't be, or there is no God. It is monstrous. How  can my Gerard be dead? How can I have killed my Gerard? I love him. Oh,  God! you know how I love him. He does not. I never told him. If he knew  my heart, he would speak to me, he would not be so deaf to his poor  Margaret. It is all a trick to make me cry out and betray him; but no!  I love him too well for that. I'll choke first.\" And she seized her own  throat, to check her wild desire to scream in her terror and anguish.    \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#20)"],[1,"ills. There was  not the slightest chance of moving the fighting cars; they were bogged  down to the axle. There was no alternative other than to wait until the  rain stopped and the mud dried. Fortunately our emergency rations were  still untouched.    Our infantry went over at dawn, and won through into the town. If it had  not been for the rain we would have made some important captures. As it  was, the Turks destroyed the bridge across the Hasa Su and retreated to  Altun Kupri by the road on the farther bank. From a hill near by we  watched everything, powerless to help in any way.    At noon the sky unexpectedly cleared and the sun came out. We unloaded a  Ford van, and with much pushing and no little spade work managed to get it  down to a road running in the direction of Kirkuk. We found the surface  equal to the light car, and slowly made our way to the outskirts of the  town, with occasional halts where digging and shoving were required. We  satisfied ourselves that, given a little sun, we could bring the armored  cars out of their bog and through to the town.    [Illustration: Kirkuk]    Next morning, in spite of the fact that more rain had fallen during the  night, I set to work on my tenders, and at length succeeded in putting  them all in Kirkuk. We were billeted in the citadel, a finely built,  substantial affair, with a courtyard that we could turn into a good  garage. The Turks had left in great haste, and, although they had  attempted a wholesale destruction of everything that they could not  take, they had been only partially successful. In my room I found a  quantity of pamphlets describing the American army--with diagrams of  insignia, and pictures of fully equipped soldiers of the different  branches of the service. There was also a map of the United States showing  the population by States. The text was, of course, in Turkish and the  printing excellently done. What the purpose might be I could not make out.    The wherefore of another booklet was more obvious. It was an illustrated  account of alleged British atrocities. Most of the pictures purported to  have been taken in the Sudan, and showed decapitated negroes. Some I am  convinced were pictures of the Armenian massacres that the Turks had  themselves taken and in a thrifty moment put to this useful purpose. This  pamphlet was printed at the press in Kirkuk.    There were a number of excellent buildings--mainly workshops and armories,  but the best was the hospital. The long corridors and deep windows of the  wards looked very cool. An up-to-date impression was given by the  individual patient charts, with the headings for the different diagnoses  printed in Turkish and French. The doctors were mainly Armenians. The  occupants were all suffering from malnutrition, and there was a great deal  of starvation in the town.    I did not wish to return to Baghdad until I could be certain that we were  not going to advance upon Altun Kupri. The engineers patched up the  bridge, and we took the cars over to the other side and went off on a  reconnaissance to ascertain how strongly the town was being held. The long  bridge from which it gets its name could easily be destroyed, and crossing  over the river would be no light matter. The surrounding mountains limited  the avenue of attack. Altogether it would not be an easy nut to crack, and  the Turks had evidently determined on a stand. What decided the army  commander to make any further attempt to advance was most probably the  great length of the line of communications, and the recent floods had made  worse conditions which were bad enough at the best. The ration supply had  fallen very low, and it seemed impossible to hold even Kirkuk unless the  rail-head could be advanced materially.    I put in all my odd moments wandering about the bazaars. The day after  the fall the merchants opened their booths and transacted business as  usual. The population was composed of many races, chiefly Turcoman, Kurd,  and Arab. There were also Armenians, Chaldeans, Syrians, and Jews. The  latter were exceedingly prosperous. Arabic and Kurdish and Turkish were  all three spoken. Kirkuk is of very ancient origin--but of its early  history little is known. The natives point out a mound which they claim to  be Daniel's tomb. Two others are shown as belonging to Shadrach and  Meshech; that of the third of the famous trio has been lost. There are  many artificial hills in the neighborhood, and doubtless in course of time  it will prove a fruitful hunting-ground for archaeologists. As far as I  could learn no serious excavating has hitherto been undertaken in the  vicinity.    The bazaars were well filled with goods of every sort. I picked up one or  two excellent rugs for very little, and a few odds and ends, dating from  Seleucid times, that had been unearthed by Arab laborers in their gardens  or brick-kilns. There were some truck-gardens in the outskirts, and we  traded fresh vegetables for some of our issue rations. There are few  greater luxuries when one has been living on canned foods for a long  time. I saw several ibex heads nailed up over the doors of houses. The  owners told me that they were to be found in the near-by mountains, but  were not plentiful. There is little large game left in Mesopotamia, and  that mainly in the mountains. I once saw a striped hyena. It is a  nocturnal animal, and they may be common, although I never came across but  the one, which I caught sight of slinking among the ruins of Istabulat,  south of Samarra, one evening when I was riding back to camp. Gazelle were  fairly numerous, and we occasionally shot one for venison. It was on the  plains between Kizil Robat and Kara Tepe that I saw the largest bands.  Judging from ancient bas-reliefs lions must at one time have been very  plentiful. In the forties of the last century Sir Henry Layard speaks of  coming across them frequently in the hill country; and later still, in the  early eighties, a fellow countryman, Mr. Fogg, in his _Land of the Arabian  Nights_, mentions that the English captain of a river steamer had recently  killed four lions, shooting from the deck of his boat. Rousseau speaks of  meeting, near Hit, a man who had been badly mauled by a lion, and was  going to town to have his wounds cared for. Leopards and bears are to be  met with in the higher mountain regions, and wild boars are common in many  districts. They inhabit the thickets along the river-banks, in country  that would permit of much sound sport in the shape of pig-sticking.    Game-birds are found in abundance; both greater and lesser bustard; black  and gray partridges, quail, geese, duck, and snipe. A week's leave could  be made provide good shooting and a welcome addition to the usual fare  when the wanderer returned. Every sort of shotgun was requisitioned, from  antiquated muzzle-loaders bought in the bazaar to the most modern  creations of Purdy sent out from India by parcel-post.    After waiting a few days further, to be certain that an attack would not  be unexpectedly ordered, I set out on my return trip to Baghdad. The river  at Taza was still up, but I borrowed six mules from an accommodating  galloping ambulance, and pulled the car across. We went by way of Kifri, a  clean, stone-built town that we found all but empty. The food situation  had become so critical that the inhabitants had drifted off, some to our  lines, others to Persia, and still others to Kirkuk and Mosul. Near Kifri  are some coal-mines about which we had heard much. It is the only place in  the country where coal is worked, and we were hoping that we might put it  to good use. Our experts, however, reported that it was of very poor  quality and worth practically nothing.          VIII    BACK THROUGH PALESTINE      Several days later I embarked at Baghdad on one of the river boats. I took  Yusuf with me to Busra to put me aboard the transport for Egypt. It was  the first time he had ever been that far down-stream, and he showed a fine  contempt for everything he saw, comparing it in most disparaging terms to  his own desolate native town of Samarra. The cheapness, variety, and  plenty of the food in the bazaars of Busra were the only things that he  allowed in any way to impress him.    I was fortunate enough to run into some old friends, and through one of  them met General Sutton, who most kindly and opportunely rescued me from  the dreary \"Rest-Camp\" and took me to his house. While I was waiting for a  chance to get a place on a transport, he one morning asked me to go with  him to Zobeir, where he was to dedicate a hospital. Zobeir is a desert  town of ten thousand or so inhabitants, situated fifteen miles inland  from Busra. The climate is supposed to be more healthful, and many of the  rich and important residents of the river town have houses there to which  they retire during the summer months. To an outsider any comparison would  seem only a refinement of degrees of suffocation. The heat of all the  coastal towns of the Persian Gulf is terrific.    Zobeir is a desert town, with its ideals and feelings true to the  inheritance of the tribesmen. It is a market for the caravans of central  Arabia. A good idea of the Turkish feeling toward it may be gathered from  the fact that the inhabitants were exempt from military service. This was  a clear admission on the part of the Turk that he could not cope with the  situation, and thought it wisest not to attempt something which he had no  hope of putting through. It was, therefore, a great triumph for the  British and a sure wedge into the confidence of the desert folk when the  hospital was opened, for any people that can introduce so marked an  innovation among the hidebound desert communities must have won their  confidence and respect in a remarkable degree. Ibrahim, the hereditary  Sheikh of Zobeir, himself contributed largely to the fund for the  endowment. It was arranged that Doctor Borrie, who"]]]
