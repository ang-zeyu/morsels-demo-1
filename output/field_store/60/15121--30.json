[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#20)"],[1,"of those  softening shades by which courtesy and the respect for open and generous  foemen qualify and mitigate the horrors of war. In time of peace,  therefore, and especially when both, as at present, were engaged in war,  waged in behalf of a common cause, and rendered dear to them by their  ideas of religion, the adventurers of both countries frequently fought  side by side, their national emulation serving only to stimulate them to  excel each other in their efforts against the common enemy.    The frank and martial character of Richard, who made no distinction  betwixt his own subjects and those of William of Scotland, excepting as  they bore themselves in the field of battle, tended much to  conciliate the troops of both nations. But upon his illness, and the  disadvantageous circumstances in which the Crusaders were placed, the  national disunion between the various bands united in the Crusade, began  to display itself, just as old wounds break out afresh in the human body  when under the influence of disease or debility.    The Scottish and English, equally jealous and high-spirited, and apt to  take offence--the former the more so, because the poorer and the weaker  nation--began to fill up by internal dissension the period when the  truce forbade them to wreak their united vengeance on the Saracens.  Like the contending Roman chiefs of old, the Scottish would admit no  superiority, and their southern neighbours would brook no equality.  There were charges and recriminations, and both the common soldiery  and their leaders and commanders, who had been good comrades in time of  victory, lowered on each other in the period of adversity, as if their  union had not been then more essential than ever, not only to the  success of their common cause, but to their joint safety. The same  disunion had begun to show itself betwixt the French and English, the  Italians and the Germans, and even between the Danes and Swedes; but it  is only that which divided the two nations whom one island bred, and who  seemed more animated against each other for the very reason, that our  narrative is principally concerned with.    Of all the English nobles who had followed their King to Palestine,  De Vaux was most prejudiced against the Scottish. They were his near  neighbours, with whom he had been engaged during his whole life in  private or public warfare, and on whom he had inflicted many calamities,  while he had sustained at their hands not a few. His love and devotion  to the King was like the vivid affection of the old English mastiff to  his master, leaving him churlish and inaccessible to all others even  towards those to whom he was indifferent--and rough and dangerous to  any against whom he entertained a prejudice. De Vaux had never observed  without jealousy and displeasure his King exhibit any mark of courtesy  or favour to the wicked, deceitful, and ferocious race born on the  other side of a river, or an imaginary line drawn through waste and  wilderness; and he even doubted the success of a Crusade in which they  were suffered to bear arms, holding them in his secret soul little  better than the Saracens whom he came to combat. It may be added that,  as being himself a blunt and downright Englishman, unaccustomed  to conceal the slightest movement either of love or of dislike, he  accounted the fair-spoken courtesy which the Scots had learned, either  from imitation of their frequent allies, the French, or which might  have arisen from their own proud and reserved character, as a false and  astucious mark of the most dangerous designs against their neighbours,  over whom he believed, with genuine English confidence, they could, by  fair manhood, never obtain any advantage.    Yet, though De Vaux entertained these sentiments concerning his Northern  neighbours, and extended them, with little mitigation, even to such as  had assumed the Cross, his respect for the King, and a sense of the duty  imposed by his vow as a Crusader, prevented him from displaying them  otherwise than by regularly shunning all intercourse with his Scottish  brethren-at-arms as far as possible, by observing a sullen taciturnity  when compelled to meet them occasionally, and by looking scornfully upon  them when they encountered on the march and in camp. The Scottish barons  and knights were not men to bear his scorn unobserved or unreplied to;  and it came to that pass that he was regarded as the determined and  active enemy of a nation, whom, after all, he only disliked, and in some  sort despised. Nay, it was remarked by close observers that, if he had  not towards them the charity of Scripture, which suffereth long, and  judges kindly, he was by no means deficient in the subordinate and  limited virtue, which alleviates and relieves the wants of others.  The wealth of Thomas of Gilsland procured supplies of provisions and  medicines, and some of these usually flowed by secret channels into  the quarters of the Scottish--his surly benevolence proceeding on the  principle that, next to a man's friend, his foe was of most importance  to him, passing over all the intermediate relations as too indifferent  to merit even a thought. This explanation is necessary, in order that  the reader may fully understand what we are now to detail.    Thomas de Vaux had not made many steps beyond the entrance of the royal  pavilion when he was aware of what the far more acute ear of the English  monarch--no mean proficient in the art of minstrelsy--had instantly  discovered, that the musical strains, namely, which had reached their  ears, were produced by the pipes, shalms, and kettle-drums of the  Saracens; and at the bottom of an avenue of tents, which formed a broad  access to the pavilion of Richard, he could see a crowd of idle soldiers  assembled around the spot from which the music was heard, almost in the  centre of the camp; and he saw, with great surprise, mingled amid the  helmets of various forms worn by the Crusaders of different nations,  white turbans and long pikes, announcing the presence of armed  Saracens, and the huge deformed heads of several camels or dromedaries,  overlooking the multitude by aid of their long, disproportioned necks.    Wondering, and displeased at a sight so unexpected and singular--for it  was customary to leave all flags of truce and other communications from  the enemy at an appointed place without the barriers--the baron looked  eagerly round for some one of whom he might inquire the cause of this  alarming novelty.    The first person whom he met advancing to him he set down at once, by  his grave and haughty step, as a Spaniard or a Scot; and presently after  muttered to himself, \"And a Scot it is--he of the Leopard. I have seen  him fight indifferently well, for one of his country.\"    Loath to ask even a passing question, he was about to pass Sir Kenneth,  with that sullen and lowering port which seems to say, \"I know thee, but  I will hold no communication with thee.\" But his purpose was defeated  by the Northern Knight, who moved forward directly to him, and accosting  him with formal courtesy, said, \"My Lord de Vaux of Gilsland, I have in  charge to speak with you.\"    \"Ha!\" returned the English baron, \"with me? But say your pleasure, so it  be shortly spoken--I am on the King's errand.\"    \"Mine touches King Richard yet more nearly,\" answered Sir Kenneth; \"I  bring him, I trust, health.\"    The Lord of Gilsland measured the Scot with incredulous eyes, and  replied, \"Thou art no leech, I think, Sir Scot; I had as soon thought of  your bringing the King of England wealth.\"    Sir Kenneth, though displeased with the manner of the baron's  reply, answered calmly, \"Health to Richard is glory and wealth to  Christendom.--But my time presses; I pray you, may I see the King?\"    \"Surely not, fair sir,\" said the baron, \"until your errand be told more  distinctly. The sick chambers of princes open not to all who inquire,  like a northern hostelry.\"    \"My lord,\" said Kenneth, \"the cross which I wear in common with  yourself, and the importance of what I have to tell, must, for the  present, cause me to pass over a bearing which else I were unapt to  endure. In plain language, then, I bring with me a Moorish physician,  who undertakes to work a cure on King Richard.\"    \"A Moorish physician!\" said De Vaux; \"and who will warrant that he  brings not poisons instead of remedies?\"    \"His own life, my lord--his head, which he offers as a guarantee.\"    \"I have known many a resolute ruffian,\" said De Vaux, \"who valued his  own life as little as it deserved, and would troop to the gallows as  merrily as if the hangman were his partner in a dance.\"    \"But thus it is, my lord,\" replied the Scot. \"Saladin, to whom none will  deny the credit of a generous and valiant enemy, hath sent this  leech hither with an honourable retinue and guard, befitting the high  estimation in which El Hakim [The Physician] is held by the Soldan, and  with fruits and refreshments for the King's private chamber, and such  message as may pass betwixt honourable enemies, praying him to be  recovered of his fever, that he may be the fitter to receive a visit  from the Soldan, with his naked scimitar in his hand, and a hundred  thousand cavaliers at his back. Will it please you, who are of the  King's secret council, to cause these camels to be discharged of  their burdens, and some order taken as to the reception of the learned  physician?\"    \"Wonderful!\" said De Vaux, as speaking to himself.--\"And who will vouch  for the honour of Saladin, in a case when bad faith would rid him at  once of his most powerful adversary?\"    \"I myself,\" replied Sir Kenneth, \"will be his guarantee, with honour,  life, and fortune.\"    \"Strange!\" again ejaculated De Vaux; \"the North vouches for the  South--the Scot for the Turk! May I crave of you, Sir Knight, how you  became concerned in this affair?\"    \"I have been absent on a pilgrimage, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#20)"],[1,"the fish are  cooked, either boiled or cooked by steam. When codfish are thoroughly  cooked, the meat will drop off of the bone in pieces, and it is very  white in color and crisp in texture. These pieces are then broken in  suitable sizes and are ready to place in the cans. The cans are filled  as full as possible, because after processing the fish will shrink  some.      CRAWFISH    The best way to can crawfish is to put it up in a bouillon as follows:  Water, 2 gallons; vinegar, 1 quart; cloves, 10; carrots in slices, 6;  onions in slices, 6; cloves of garlic, 3.    To the above should be added a good quantity of pepper to suit the  taste, a little salt and bunch of parsley and a little thyme. Boil  slowly for about an hour. Throw in the crawfish after the intestines  have been extracted; to do this take the live crawfish in your hand  and tear off the wing which is in the middle of the tail; it will pull  out at the same time a little black intestine which is very bitter.  Boil one or two minutes, never longer, put in cans and process.

Food poisoning--commonly called ptomaine  poisoning--and the effects ascribed to \"salts of tin\" result from  improper handling and improper preparation of the product before  packing, or from allowing the product to stand in the tin after it has  been opened. The raw food products used for canning in tin must be in  sound condition, just as they must be if put into glass containers.    It is true that canned foods may be rendered unfit for use by improper  handling of the product before packing and that decomposition may  occur after canning, owing to insufficient processing, improper  sealing or the use of leaky containers. This condition, however, is no  more likely to be encountered in foods put up in tin than in products  canned in other types of containers. You run no more danger of poison  from your own tin-canned products than from tin-canned food bought at  the store. Most canned foods if in a spoiled condition readily show  this condition by the swelling of the can or by odor or taste. Canned  foods showing such evidences of decomposition should not be used.    Certain foods which are high in protein, such as meats, peas, beans  and fish products, may undergo decomposition without making this  condition obvious to the senses. It is essential, therefore, that the  greatest care be taken to subject such products to proper preparation  and ample processing. It should be remembered that canned foods, after  opening the containers, should be treated as perishable products and  should be handled with the same precautions that are applied when  fresh products are being used.      ADVANTAGES OF CANS    Many housewives ask, \"Why can in tin when we have always used glass  jars?\" There are many advantages in canning in tin which we can well  consider. There is no breakage as in glass; you can handle the tin  cans as carelessly as you choose and you will not hear a snap or crack  indicating a lost jar. Furthermore, tin cans are easier to handle not  only in canning but in storing.    The expense each year of new tin covers or new tin cans is no more  than the purchase of new rubbers and the replacement of broken glass  jars. Furthermore, one big advantage of tin over glass is that tin  cans can be cooled quickly by plunging them into cold water  immediately upon removal from the canner, and thus the cooking is  stopped at the proper moment. The product is consequently better in  form and flavor than when the cooking is prolonged, as it must be in  glass jars. Many women like the large openings of cans because they  can make better packs than when using narrow-necked jars.    If you do not care to bother with the soldering you can purchase a  safe and simple device that will do the work for you. This device is  called a tin-can sealer. With a sealer no soldering is necessary.  Even an inexperienced person, by following directions carefully, can  seal a can as well as an experienced one. The sealed cans look exactly  like those purchased at the store. Two or three cans a minute can be  sealed with this device.    This is the way to operate a can sealer: Prepare the fruits and  vegetables as for any canning, following directions formerly given for  cold-pack canning.    After the fruits or vegetables have been properly prepared, blanched  and cold-dipped if necessary, place them in sanitary, solderless cans.  Put water or sirup on, according to directions. Put the top on the can  and place the can in the sealer.    Raise the can into the chunk by swinging the raising lever at the  bottom of the machine against the frame. Turn the crank, rapidly at  first, with the right hand, and at the same time push the seaming-roll  lever very slowly with the left hand until it will go no farther. This  is one of the most important steps in the use of the machine. Continue  to give the crank several turns after the seaming-roll lever has gone  as far as it will go. This completes the first operation or seam.    Continue turning the crank with the right hand, and with the left hand  pull the seaming-roll lever until it will go no farther in this  direction. After this has been done give the crank several more turns,  and the second and final operation is complete. Bring the seaming-roll  lever back to the middle position and remove the can. The can is then  ready for sterilization.    Before sealing a new lot of cans or after changing for a different  size of can, one or two of the cans about to be used should be tested  for leaks. If this is done and the cans stand the test it will be  unnecessary to test the remaining cans of that same lot. The following  is a simple and safe test:    Put one tablespoon of water into an empty can and seal. Have on hand a  vessel containing enough boiling water to cover the can. Set aside  and, as soon as bubbles disappear from the surface, immerse the can in  the hot water. This heats the water in the can and creates a pressure  within the can. Keep the can under the surface for two minutes, and if  by that time no bubbles rise from the can the can has been sealed  air-tight.      ADJUSTING THE SEAMING ROLLS    If bubbles rise from the can the seam is not sufficiently tight. If  this seam is not sufficiently tight the _second_ seaming roll needs  adjusting, provided the directions regarding seaming rolls given below  have been observed. To set the rolls proceed as follows: Loosen the  nut on the bottom of the seaming-roll pin. With a screw driver turn  the seaming-roll pin counter clockwise--that is, from right to left.  Turn very slightly and, while holding the seaming-roll pin with the  screw driver in the left hand, tighten nut with the right hand, and  test as before.    Occasionally it is well to compare the seam after the first operation  with the sample can which is sent with the machine.    If seaming rolls cut into the can they are set too close, and the  seaming-roll pin should be adjusted in the opposite direction from  above.    After adjusting, always test cans as suggested above before canning.  The seaming rolls are set before the machine leaves the factory and  should not require adjusting for some time, but I have found that  slight variations in cans may make adjusting necessary.    If for any reason the second seaming roll is brought into contact with  the can before the first operation is complete it may injure the can  seriously, thus preventing an air-tight seam.    If the first seaming roll is forced in too rapidly it may ruin the  seam. Push the seaming-roll lever gently and steadily, while turning  the crank with the right hand. This rolls the seam gradually. There is  no danger from bringing in the second seaming roll too quickly if the  first seaming roll has completed its work.    There are thus, as you see, two kinds of tin cans used in home  canning: The sanitary or rim-seal can, which is used with a sealer,  and the cap-and-hole can. The latter consists of a can, and a cover  which carries a rim of solder and is fastened on the can by the  application of heat.    The sanitary can has a cover a trifle larger than the diameter of the  can, thus leaving the full diameter of the can open for filling. That  part of the cover that comes into contact with the can is coated with  a compound or fitted with a paper gasket or ring which makes a perfect  seal when the cover is crimped on the can. Some mechanical device is  necessary for sealing this can, and this is the sealer.    Cans may be had with inside enamel or plain without any enamel. The  following fruits and vegetables should be canned in enamel-lined cans:  All berry fruits, cherries, plums, rhubarb, pumpkin, beets and squash.  All highly colored products should be canned in enamel-lined cans to  prevent the bleaching effect induced by their action upon the plain  tin. Some prefer to can fish and meat in the enamel-li"]]]
