Let us see.\"    He disengaged the frame from the two nails on which it hung, and,  turning it round, glanced at the back; which he then presented for my  inspection. A label on the backing paper bore the words, \"J. Budge,  Frame-maker and Gilder, 16, Gt. Anne Street, W.C.\"    \"Well?\" I said, when I had read the label without gathering from it  anything fresh.    \"The label, you observe, is the right way up as it hangs on the wall.\"    \"So it is,\" I rejoined hastily, a little annoyed that I had not been  quicker to observe so obvious a fact. \"I see your point. You mean that  the frame-maker hung the thing upside down and Jeffrey never noticed the  mistake?\"    \"That is a perfectly sound explanation,\" said Thorndyke. \"But I think  there is something more. You will notice that the label is an old one;  it must have been on some years, to judge by its dingy appearance,  whereas the two mirror-plates look to me comparatively new. But we can  soon put that matter to the test, for the label was evidently stuck on  when the frame was new, and if the plates were screwed on at the same  time, the wood that they cover will be clean and new-looking.\"    He drew from his pocket a \"combination\" knife containing, among other  implements, a screw-driver, with which he carefully extracted the screws  from one of the little brass plates by which the frame had been  suspended from the nails.    \"You see,\" he said, when he had removed the plate and carried the  photograph over to the gasjet, \"the wood covered by the plate is as  dirty and time-stained as the rest of the frame. The plates have been  put on recently.\"    \"And what are we to infer from that?\"    \"Well, since there are no other marks of plates or rings upon the  frame, we may safely infer that the photograph was never hung up until  it came to these rooms.\"    \"Yes, I suppose we may. But what then? What inference does that lead  to?\"    Thorndyke reflected for a few moments and I continued:    \"It is evident that this photograph suggests more to you than it does to  me. I should like to hear your exposition of its bearing on the case, if  it has any.\"    \"Whether or no it has any real bearing on the case,\" Thorndyke answered,  \"it is impossible for me to say at this stage. I told you that I had  proposed to myself one or two hypotheses to account for and explain  Jeffrey Blackmore's will, and I may say that the curious misplacement of  this photograph fits more than one of them. I won't say more than that,  because I think it would be profitable to you to work at this case  independently. You have all the facts that I have and you shall have a  copy of my notes of Marchmont's statement of the case. With this  material you ought to be able to reach some conclusion. Of course  neither of us may be able to make anything of the case--it doesn't look  very hopeful at present--but whatever happens, we can compare notes  after the event and you will be the richer by so much experience of  actual investigation. But I will start you off with one hint, which is  this: that neither you nor Marchmont seem to appreciate in the least the  very extraordinary nature of the facts that he communicated to us.\"    \"I thought Marchmont seemed pretty much alive to the fact that it was a  very queer will.\"    \"So he did,\" agreed Thorndyke. \"But that is not quite what I mean. The  whole set of circumstances, taken together and in relation to one  another, impressed me as most remarkable; and that is why I am giving so  much attention to what looks at first sight like such a very unpromising  case. Copy out my notes, Jervis, and examine the facts critically. I  think you will see what I mean. And now let us proceed.\"    He replaced the brass plate and having reinserted the screws, hung up  the frame, and proceeded to browse slowly round the room, stopping now  and again to inspect the Japanese colour-prints and framed photographs  of buildings and other objects of archaeological interest that formed  the only attempts at wall-decoration. To one of the former he drew my  attention.    \"These things are of some value,\" he remarked. \"Here is one by  Utamaro--that little circle with the mark over it is his signature--and  you notice that the paper is becoming spotted in places with mildew. The  fact is worth noting in more than one connection.\"    I accordingly made a mental note and the perambulation continued.    \"You observe that Jeffrey used a gas-stove, instead of a coal fire, no  doubt to economize work, but perhaps for other reasons. Presumably he  cooked by gas, too; let us see.\"    We wandered into the little cupboard-like kitchen and glanced round. A  ring-burner on a shelf, a kettle, a frying-pan and a few pieces of  crockery were its sole appointments. Apparently the porter was correct  in his statement as to Jeffrey's habits.    Returning to the sitting-room, Thorndyke resumed his inspection, pulling  out the table drawers, peering inquisitively into cupboards and  bestowing a passing glance on each of the comparatively few objects that  the comfortless room contained.    \"I have never seen a more characterless apartment,\" was his final  comment. \"There is nothing that seems to suggest any kind of habitual  activity on the part of the occupant. Let us look at the bedroom.\"    We passed through into the chamber of tragic memories, and, when  Thorndyke had lit the gas, we stood awhile looking about us in silence.  It was a bare, comfortless room, dirty, neglected and squalid. The bed  appeared not to have been remade since the catastrophe, for an  indentation still marked the place where the corpse had lain, and even a  slight powdering of ash could still be seen on the shabby counterpane.  It looked to me a typical opium-smoker's bedroom.    \"Well,\" Thorndyke remarked at length, \"there is character enough  here--of a kind. Jeffrey Blackmore would seem to have been a man of few  needs. One could hardly imagine a bedroom in which less attention seemed  to have been given to the comfort of the occupant.\"    He looked about him keenly and continued: \"The syringe and the rest of  the lethal appliances and material have been taken away, I see.  Probably the analyst did not return them. But there are the opium-pipe  and the jar and the ash-bowl, and I presume those are the clothes that  the undertakers removed from the body. Shall we look them over?\"    He took up the clothes which lay, roughly folded, on a chair and held  them up, garment by garment.    \"These are evidently the trousers,\" he remarked, spreading them out on  the bed. \"Here is a little white spot on the middle of the thigh which  looks like a patch of small crystals from a drop of the solution. Just  light the lamp, Jervis, and let us examine it with a lens.\"    I lit the lamp, and when we had examined the spot minutely and  identified it as a mass of minute crystals, Thorndyke asked:    \"What do you make of those creases? You see there is one on each leg.\"    \"It looks as if the trousers had been turned up. But if they have been  they must have been turned up about seven inches. Poor Jeffrey couldn't  have had much regard for appearances, for they would have been right  above his socks. But perhaps the creases were made in undressing the  body.\"    \"That is possible,\" said Thorndyke: \"though I don't quite see how it  would have happened. I notice that his pockets seem to have been  emptied--no, wait; here is something in the waistcoat pocket.\"    He drew out a shabby, pigskin card-case and a stump of lead pencil, at  which latter he looked with what seemed to me much more interest than  was deserved by so commonplace an object.    \"The cards, you observe,\" said he, \"are printed from type, not from a  plate. I would note that fact. And tell me what you make of that.\"    He handed me the pencil, which I examined with concentrated attention,  helping myself even with the lamp and my pocket lens. But even with  these aids I failed to discover anything unusual in its appearance.  Thorndyke watched me with a mischievous smile, and, when I had finished,  inquired:    \"Well; what is it?\"    \"Confound you!\" I exclaimed. \"It's a pencil. Any fool can see that, and  this particular fool can't see any more. It's a wretched stump of a  pencil, villainously cut to an abominably bad point. It is coloured dark  red on the outside and was stamped with some name that began with  C--O--Co-operative Stores, perhaps.\"    \"Now, my dear Jervis,\" Thorndyke protested, \"don't begin by confusing  speculation with fact. The letters which remain are C--O. Note that fact  and find out what pencils there are which have inscriptions beginning  with those letters. I am not going to help you, because you can easily  do this for yourself. And it will be good discipline even if the fact  turns out to mean nothing.\"    At this moment he stepped back suddenly, and, looking down at the floor,  said:    \"Give me the lamp, Jervis, I've trodden on something that felt like  glass.\"    I brought the lamp to the place where he had been standing, close by  the bed, and we both knelt on the floor, throwing the light of the lamp  on the bare and dusty boards. Under the bed, just within reach of the  foot of a person standing close by, was a little patch of fragments of  glass. Thorndyke produced a piece of paper from his pocket and  delicately swept the little fragments on to it, remarking:    \"By the look of things, I am not the first person who has trodden on  that object, whatever it is. Do you mind holding the lamp while I  inspect the remains?\"    I took the lamp and held it over the paper while he examined the little  heap of glass through his lens.    \"Well,\" I asked. \"What have you found?\"    \"That is what I am asking myself,\" he replied. \"As far as I can judge by  the appearance of these fragments, they appear to be portions of a small  watch-glass. I wish there were some larger pieces.\"    \"Perhaps there are,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#20)"],[1,"wouldn't have to take any more jolts  this season--but maybe I've got more nerves than sense on this land  business. I sure do hate to see old Brown cutting in the way he's  doing--but if he just runs what cattle he can keep under fence, it  won't hurt us none.\"    \"He's fencing a large tract, William--a very large tract. It takes  in--\"    \"Oh, let up, Dilly! I don't want to know how big it is--not right now.  I'm willing to take my dose uh bad medicine when it's time for it--but  I ain't none greedy about swallowing the whole bottle at once! I feel  as if I'd got enough down me to do for a while.\"    \"You are wiser than most people,\" Dill observed dryly.    \"Oh, sure. Say, if I don't see Flora--I'm going to hike back to camp  pretty quick--you tell her I'm going to try and pull in close enough  to take in that dance at Hardup, the Fourth. I heard there was going  to be one. We can't get through by then, and I may not show up at the  ranch, but I'll sure be at the dance. I--I'm in a hurry, and I've  got to go right now.\" Which he did, and his going savored strongly of  flight.    Dill, looking after him queerly, turned and saw Mama Joy standing in  the doorway. With eyes that betrayed her secret she, too, was looking  after Billy.    \"There is something more I wanted to say to William,\" explained Dill  quite unnecessarily, and went striding down the path after him. When  he reached the stable, however, he did not have anything in particular  to say--or if he had, he refrained from disturbing Billy, who was  stretched out upon a pile of hay in one of the stalls.    \"My hoss ain't through eating, yet,\" said Billy, lifting his head  like a turtle. \"I'm going, pretty soon. I sure do love a pile uh fresh  hay.\"    Their eyes met understandingly, and Dill shook his head.    \"Too bad--too bad!\" he said gravely.          CHAPTER XVI.    _Self-defense_.      The wagons of the Double-Crank had stopped to tarry over the Fourth  at Fighting Wolf Spring, which bubbles from under a great rock in a  narrow \"draw\" that runs itself out to a cherry-masked point halfway  up the side of Fighting Wolf Butte. Billy, with wisdom born of much  experience in the ways of a round-up crew when the Fourth of July  draws near, started his riders at day-dawn to rake all Fighting Wolf  on its southern side. \"Better catch up your ridge-runners,\" he had  cautioned, \"because I'll set yuh plumb afoot if yuh don't.\" The boys,  knowing well his meaning and that the circle that day would be a  big one over rough country, saddled their best horses and settled  themselves to a hard day's work.    Till near noon they rode, and branded after dinner to the tune of much  scurrying and bawling and a great deal of dust and rank smoke, urged  by the ever-present fear that they would not finish in time. But their  leader was fully as anxious as they and had timed the work so that by  four o'clock the herd was turned loose, the fires drenched with water  and the branding irons put away.    At sundown the long slope from Fighting Wolf Spring was dotted for  a space with men, fresh-shaven, clean-shirted and otherwise  rehabilitated, galloping eagerly toward Hardup fifteen miles away.  That they had been practically in the saddle since dawn was a trifle  not to be considered; they would dance until another dawn to make up  for it.    Hardup, decked meagrely in the colors that spell patriotism, was  unwontedly alive and full of Fourth of July noises. But even with  the distraction of a holiday and a dance just about to start and the  surrounding country emptied of humans into the town, the clatter  of the Double-Crank outfit--fifteen wiry young fellows hungry for  play--brought men to the doors and into the streets.    Charming Billy, because his eagerness was spiced with expectancy, did  not stop even for a drink, but made for the hotel. At the hotel he  learned that his \"crowd\" was over at the hall, and there he hurried so  soon as he had removed the dust and straightened his tie and brushed  his hair and sworn at his upstanding scalp-lock, in the corner of the  hotel office dedicated to public cleanliness.    It was a pity that such single-hearted effort must go unrewarded, but  the fact remains that he reached the hall just as the couples were  promenading for the first waltz. He was permitted the doubtful  pleasure of a welcoming nod from Flora as she went by with the  Pilgrim. Dill was on the floor with Mama Joy, and at a glance he saw  how it was; the Pilgrim had \"butted in\" and come along with them. He  supposed Flora really could not help it, but it was pretty hard  lines, all the same. For even in the range-land are certain rules of  etiquette which must be observed when men and women foregather in the  pursuit of pleasure. Billy remembered ruefully how a girl must dance  first, last, and oftenest with her partner of the evening, and must  eat supper with him besides, whether she likes or not; to tweak this  rule means to insult the man beyond forgiveness.    \"Well, it wouldn't hurt me none if Flora _did_ cut him off short,\"  Billy concluded, his eyes following them resentfully whenever they  whirled down to his end of the room. \"The way I've got it framed up,  I'd spoke for her first--if Dilly told her what I said.\"    Still, what he thought privately did not seem to have much effect upon  realities. Flora he afterward saw intermittently while they danced a  quadrille together, and she made it plain that she had not considered  Billy as her partner; how could she, when he was trailing around over  the country with the round-up, and nobody knew whether he would come  or not? No, Mr. Walland did not come to the ranch so very often.  She added naively that he was awfully busy. He had ridden in with  them--and why not? Was there any reason--    Billy, though he could think of reasons in plenty, turned just then to  balance on the corner and swing, and to do many other senseless things  at the behest of the man on the platform, so that when they stood  together again for a brief space, both were breathless and she was  anxiously feeling her hair and taking out side combs and putting them  back again, and Billy felt diffident about interrupting her and said  no more about who was her partner.    An hour or so later he was looking about for her, meaning to dance  with her again, when a man pushed him aside hurriedly and went across  the floor and spoke angrily to another. Billy, moving aside so that he  could see, discovered Flora standing up with the Pilgrim for the dance  in another \"set\" that was forming. The man who had jostled him was  speaking to them angrily, but Billy could not catch the words.    \"He's drunk,\" called the Pilgrim to the floor manager. \"Put him out!\"    Several men left their places and rushed over to them. Because Flora  was there and likely to be involved, Billy reached them first.    \"This was _my_ dance!\" the fellow was expostulating. \"She promised it  to me.\"    \"Aw, he's drunk,\" repeated the Pilgrim, turning to Billy. \"It's Gus  Svenstrom. He's got it in for me because I fired him last week. Throw  him out! Miss Bridger isn't going to dance with a drunken stiff like  him.\"    \"Oh, I'll go--I ain't so drunk I've got to be carried!\" retorted the  other, and pushed his way angrily through the crowd.    Flora had kept her place. Though the color had gone from her cheeks,  she seemed to have no intention of quitting the quadrille, so there  was nothing for Billy to do but get off the floor and leave her to her  partner. He went out after the Swede, and, seeing him headed for the  saloon across from the hotel, followed aimlessly. He was not quite  comfortable in the hall, anyway, for he had caught Mama Joy eying him  strangely, and he thought she was wondering why he had not asked her  to dance.    Charming Billy was not by nature a diplomat; it never once occurred to  him that he would better treat Mama Joy as if that half minute in the  kitchen had never been. He had said good evening to her when he first  met her that evening, and he considered his duty done. He did not want  to dance with her, and that was, in his opinion, an excellent reason  for not doing so. He did not like to have her watching him with those  big, round, blue eyes of hers, so he stayed in the saloon for a while  and only left it to go to supper when some one said that the dance  crowd was over there. There might be some chance that would permit him  to eat with Flora.    There are moments in a town when, even with many people coming and  going, one may look and see none. When Billy closed the door of the  saloon behind him and started across to the hotel, not a man did he  see, though there was sound in plenty from the saloons and the hotel  and the hall. He was nearly half across the street when two men came  into sight and met suddenly just outside a window of the hotel. Billy,  in the gloom of starlight and no moon, could not tell who they were;  he heard a sharp sentence or two, saw them close together, heard a  blow. Then they broke apart and there was the flash of a shot. One  man fell and the other whirled about as if he would run, but Billy was  then almost upon them and the man turned back and stood looking down  at the fallen figure.    \"Damn him, he pulled a knife on me!\" he cried defensively. Billy saw  that it was the Pilgrim.    \"Who is he?\" he asked, and knelt beside the form. The man was lying  just where the lamp-light streamed out from the window, but his face  was in shadow. \"Oh, it's that Swede,\" he added, and rose. \"I'll get  somebody; I believe he's dead.\" He left the Pilgrim standing there and  hurried to the door of the hotel office.    In any other locality a shot would have brought on the run every man  who heard it; but in a \"cow-town,\" especially on a dance night,  shots are as common as shouts. In Hardup that night there had been  periodical outbursts which no one, not even the women, minded in the  least.    So it was"]]]
