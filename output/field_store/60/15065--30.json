Why cannot one go on dancing  thus--on and on to the end of time.\"    \"I feel,\" said Amrei, \"just as if we were two doves flying through the  air. Juhu! away into the heavens!\" And \"Juhu!\" cried the lad gleefully,  \"Juhu!\" And the sound shot up heavenward like a fiery rocket. \"Juhu!\"  cried Amrei, rejoicing with him. And on they danced with ever-increasing  joy. Finally Amrei said:    \"Tell me--is the music going on? Are the musicians still playing? I  don't hear them any more.\"    \"Of course they are still playing. Don't you hear them?\"    \"Yes, now I do,\" said Amrei. And now they stopped, for her partner  probably felt that she was becoming giddy with happiness.    The stranger led Amrei to the table, and gave her wine to drink, and did  not let go her hand. He lifted the Swedish ducat that hung from her  necklace, and said:    \"This ducat is in a good place.\"    \"And it came from a good hand,\" answered Amrei. \"That necklace was given  to me when I was a little child.\"    \"By a relative?\"    \"No, the lady was no relative.\"    \"Dancing agrees with you apparently.\"    \"Oh, indeed it does! You see, I'm obliged to jump around so much all the  year around when nobody is playing for me--and therefore I enjoy it  doubly now.\"    \"You look as round as a ball,\" said the stranger in jest. \"You must live  where the food is good.\"    Amrei replied quickly:    \"It's not the food itself that does it, but the way one enjoys it.\"    The stranger nodded; and after a pause, he spoke again, half  questioningly:    \"You are the daughter of Farmer--\"    \"No, I am a maid,\" replied Amrei, looking him full in the face. The  stranger's eyes almost fell; the lids quivered, but he held them open by  force. And this struggle and victory of the bodily eye seemed to be a  symbol of what was going on within him. He felt almost inclined to leave  the girl sitting there; but he resisted and conquered the impulse, and  said:    \"Come, let us have another dance.\"    He held her hand fast, and the pleasure and excitement began again; but  this time it was more quiet and moderate. Both of them seemed to feel  that the sensation of being lifted to the sky was over and past; and  this thought was evidently in Amrei's mind when she said:    \"Well, we have been very happy together once, even if we don't see each  other again in all our lives, and even though neither of us knows the  other's name.\"    The youth nodded and said:    \"You are right.\"    Amrei held the end of her braid between her lips in embarrassment, and  after a pause spoke again:    \"The enjoyment one has once had cannot be taken from one; and whoever  you are, you need never repent of having given a poor girl a pleasure  she will remember all her life.\"    \"I don't repent of it,\" replied her partner. \"But I know that you repent  of having answered me so sharply this morning.\"    \"Oh, yes, you are right there!\" cried Amrei; and then the stranger said:    \"Would you venture to go out into the field with me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And do you trust me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But what will your people say?\"    \"I have nobody but myself to give account of my actions to; I am an  orphan.\"    Hand in hand the two went out of the dancing-room. Barefoot heard  several people whispering and tittering behind her, but she kept her  eyes fixed on the ground. She wondered if she had not ventured too far  after all.    In the fields, where the first ears of wheat were beginning to sprout  and still lay half concealed in their green sheaths, the two stopped and  stood looking at each other in silence. For a long time neither said a  word. But finally it was the man who broke the silence, by saying, half  to himself:    \"I wonder how it is that one, on first sight, can be so--so--I don't  know--so confidential with a person? How is it one can read what is  written in another's face?\" \"Now we have set a poor soul free,\" said  Amrei; \"for you know, when two people think the same thought at the same  time, they are said to set a soul free. And I was thinking the very  words you just spoke.\"    \"Indeed? And do you know why?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Will you tell me?\"    \"Why not? Look you; I have been a goose-keeper--\"    At these words the stranger started again; but he pretended that  something had fallen into his eye, and began to rub that organ  vigorously, while Barefoot went on, undismayed:    \"Look you; when one sits or lies alone out in the fields all day, one  thinks of hundreds of things, and some of them are strange thoughts  indeed. Just try it yourself, and you will certainly find it so. Every  fruit-tree, if you look at it as a whole, has the appearance of the  fruit it bears. Take the apple-tree; does it not look, spread out broad,  and, as it were, in round pieces, like the apple itself? And the same is  true of the pear-tree and the cherry-tree, if only you look at them in  the right way. Look what a long trunk the cherry-tree has--like the stem  of a cherry. And so I think--\"    \"Well, what do you think?\"    \"You'll laugh at me; but just as the fruit-trees look like the fruits  they bear, so is it also with people; one can tell what they are at once  by looking at them. But the trees, to be sure, always have honest faces,  while people can dissemble theirs. But I am talking nonsense, am I not?\"    \"No, you have not kept geese for nothing,\" said the lad; and there was a  strange mixture of feelings in the tone of his voice. \"I like to talk  with you. I should give you a kiss, if I were not afraid of doing what  is wrong.\"    Barefoot trembled all over. She stooped to break off a flower, but did  not break it. There was a long pause, and then the lad went on: \"We  shall most likely never meet again, and so it is best as it is.\"    Hand in hand the two went back to the dancing-room. There they danced  once more together without saying a word to each other, and when the  dance was over, the young man again led her to the table, and said:    \"Now I shall say good-by. But first you must get your breath, and then  drink once more.\"    He handed her the glass, and when she set it down again, he said:    \"You must drain it, for my sake, to the very bottom.\"    Amrei drank and drank; and when the glass was empty in her hand, she  looked around--the stranger was gone! She went down and stood in front  of the house; and there she saw him again, not far away, riding off on  his white horse; but he did not look back.    The mist hung over the valley like a veil of clouds, and the sun had  already set. Barefoot said to herself, almost aloud:    \"I wish tomorrow would never come, but that it would always be  today--always today!\" And then she stood still, lost in dreams.    The night came on quickly. The moon, looking like a thin sickle, was  resting on the summits of the dark mountains. One little Bernese wagon  after another drove away. Barefoot went to find her master's chaise, to  which the horses were now being hitched. Then Rose came and told her  brother that she had promised some young people of her village to go  home in company with them. And it was understood as a matter of course  that the farmer could not drive home alone with the maid. And so the  little Bernese wagon went rattling off toward home with a single  occupant. Rose must have seen Barefoot, but she acted as if she were not  there. And so Barefoot once more wandered forth along the road on which  the stranger had departed. Whither could he have gone? How many hundred  villages and hamlets there were along that road, and to which one was  he bound? Barefoot found the place again where he had first accosted her  in the morning; she repeated aloud to herself his salutation, and the  answer she had given him. And once more she sat down behind the hazel  hedge, where in the morning she had slept and dreamt. A yellowhammer sat  on a slender spray, and its six notes sounded just as if it were saying:  \"And why art thou still here? And why art thou still here?\"    Barefoot had lived through a whole life's history in this one day. Could  it be but a single day? She went back again to the dance, but did not go  up to the room itself. And then she started out homeward alone. She had  gone almost halfway to Haldenbrunn, when she suddenly turned back; she  seemed unable to tear herself away from the place where she had been so  happy. And she said to herself that it was not right for her to go home  alone anyway; she should go in company with the young men and girls from  her village. When she arrived in front of the tavern at Endringen again,  she found several people from her village already assembled there.    \"Ah, are you here, too, Barefoot?\" was the only greeting she received.    And now there was great confusion; for many who had been the first to  urge going home, were still upstairs dancing. And now some strange lads  came and begged and besought them to stay for just one more dance; and  they got their way. Barefoot, too, went upstairs, but only to look on.  At last the cry was: \"Whoever dances now shall be left behind;\" and  after a great deal of difficulty and much rushing to and fro, the  Haldenbrunn contingent was finally assembled in front of the house. Some  of the musicians escorted them through the village, and many a sleepy  father came to the window to see what was going on, while now and then a  woman, who had once been one of the merry-makers herself, but who had  married and so culminated her days of frivolity, would appear at a  window and cry: \"A pleasant journey home!\"    The night was dark, and large pine fagots had been provided for torches;  and the lads who carried them danced about and shouted with joy.  Scarcely had the musicians gone back, and scarcely had the party left  Endringen well behind, when the cry was: \"Put out the torches!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#20)"],[1," at the extremity of the castle D'Artagnan found himself  overlooking a beautiful valley, in which, at the foot of a charming  little lake, stood several scattered houses, which, humble in their  aspect, and covered, some with tiles, others with thatch, seemed to  acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau, built about the  beginning of the reign of Henry IV., and surmounted by four stately,  gilded weather-cocks. D'Artagnan no longer doubted that this was  Porthos's pleasant dwelling place.    The road led straight up to the chateau which, compared to its ancestor  on the hill, was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc d'Enghein  would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles  VII. D'Artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road, followed by  Planchet at the same pace.    In ten minutes D'Artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted  with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate, the points and  crossed bars of which were gilt. In the midst of this avenue was a  nobleman, dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the  iron gate, riding on a tall horse. On his right hand and his left were  two footmen, with the seams of their dresses laced. A considerable  number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord.    \"Ah!\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de  Bracieux de Pierrefonds? Well-a-day! how he has shrunk since he gave up  the name of Porthos!\"    \"This cannot be Monsieur Porthos,\" observed Planchet replying, as it  were, to his master's thoughts. \"Monsieur Porthos was six feet high;  this man is scarcely five.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said D'Artagnan, \"the people are bowing very low to this  person.\"    As he spoke, he rode toward the tall horse--to the man of importance and  his valets. As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this  individual.    \"Jesu!\" cried Planchet, \"can it be?\"    At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty  air, and the two travelers could see, displayed in all their brilliancy,  the large eyes, the vermilion visage, and the eloquent smile  of--Mousqueton.    It was indeed Mousqueton--Mousqueton, as fat as a pig, rolling about  with rude health, puffed out with good living, who, recognizing  D'Artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin, slipped  off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off, so that the  homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun, which  eclipsed the former luminary.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan! Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" cried Mousqueton, his fat  cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy; \"Monsieur  d'Artagnan! oh! what joy for my lord and master, Du Vallon de Bracieux  de Pierrefonds!\"    \"Thou good Mousqueton! where is thy master?\"    \"You stand upon his property!\"    \"But how handsome thou art--how fat! thou hast prospered and grown  stout!\" and D'Artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change  good fortune had produced on the once famished one.    \"Hey, yes, thank God, I am pretty well,\" said Mousqueton.    \"But hast thou nothing to say to thy friend Planchet?\"    \"How, my friend Planchet? Planchet--art thou there?\" cried Mousqueton,  with open arms and eyes full of tears.    \"My very self,\" replied Planchet; \"but I wanted first to see if thou  wert grown proud.\"    \"Proud toward an old friend? never, Planchet! thou wouldst not have  thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well.\"    \"So far so well,\" answered Planchet, alighting, and extending his arms  to Mousqueton, the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched  those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great  lord in disguise, so highly did they estimate the position of  Mousqueton.    \"And now, sir,\" resumed Mousqueton, when he had rid himself of Planchet,  who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend's fat back,  \"now, sir, allow me to leave you, for I could not permit my master to  hear of your arrival from any but myself; he would never forgive me for  not having preceded you.\"    \"This dear friend,\" said D'Artagnan, carefully avoiding to utter either  the former name borne by Porthos or his new one, \"then he has not  forgotten me?\"    \"Forgotten--he!\" cried Mousqueton; \"there's not a day, sir, that we  don't expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of  Monsieur de Gassion, or of Monsieur de Bassompierre.\"    On D'Artagnan's lips there played one of those rare and melancholy  smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul--the last  trace of youth and happiness that had survived life's disillusions.    \"And you--fellows,\" resumed Mousqueton, \"stay near Monsieur le Comte  d'Artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to  prepare my lord for his visit.\"    And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass  at a hand gallop.    \"Ah, there! there's something promising,\" said D'Artagnan. \"No  mysteries, no cloak to hide one's self in, no cunning policy here;  people laugh outright, they weep for joy here. I see nothing but faces a  yard broad; in short, it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday  garb, and that the trees, instead of leaves and flowers, are covered  with red and green ribbons as on gala days.\"    \"As for me,\" said Planchet, \"I seem to smell, from this place, even, a  most delectable perfume of fine roast meat, and to see the scullions in  a row by the hedge, hailing our approach. Ah! sir, what a cook must  Monsieur Pierrefonds have, when he was so fond of eating and drinking,  even whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos!\"    \"Say no more!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"If the reality corresponds with  appearances I am lost; for a man so well off will never change his happy  condition, and I shall fail with him, as I have already done with  Aramis.\"          11. Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness.      D'Artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the  chateau. He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps. Let us  do justice to D'Artagnan. Independently of every selfish wish, his heart  palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor,  which recalled to him a good and brave man.    He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms; the whole body of  servants, arranged in a semi-circle at a respectful distance, looked on  with humble curiosity. Mousqueton, at the head of them, wiped his eyes.  Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend.    \"Ah! how delightful to see you again, dear friend!\" he cried, in a voice  which was now changed from a baritone into a bass, \"you've not then  forgotten me?\"    \"Forget you! oh! dear Du Vallon, does one forget the happiest days of  flowery youth, one's dearest friends, the dangers we have dared  together? On the contrary, there is not an hour we have passed together  that is not present to my memory.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Porthos, trying to give to his mustache a curl which it  had lost whilst he had been alone. \"Yes, we did some fine things in our  time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel.\"    And he heaved a sigh.    \"Under any circumstances,\" he resumed, \"you are welcome, my dear friend;  you will help me to recover my spirits; to-morrow we will hunt the hare  on my plain, which is a superb tract of land, or pursue the deer in my  woods, which are magnificent. I have four harriers which are considered  the swiftest in the county, and a pack of hounds which are unequalled  for twenty leagues around.\"    And Porthos heaved another sigh.    \"But, first,\" interposed D'Artagnan, \"you must present me to Madame du  Vallon.\"    A third sigh from Porthos.    \"I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago,\" he said, \"and you find me still  in affliction on that account. That was the reason why I left my Chateau  du Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux. Poor Madame du  Vallon! her temper was uncertain, but she came at last to accustom  herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes.\"    \"So you are free now, and rich?\"    \"Alas!\" groaned Porthos, \"I am a widower and have forty thousand francs  a year. Let us go to breakfast.\"    \"I shall be happy to do so; the morning air has made me hungry.\"    \"Yes,\" said Porthos; \"my air is excellent.\"    They went into the chateau; there was nothing but gilding, high and low;  the cornices were gilt, the mouldings were gilt, the legs and arms of  the chairs were gilt. A table, ready set out, awaited them.    \"You see,\" said Porthos, \"this is my usual style.\"    \"Devil take me!\" answered D'Artagnan, \"I wish you joy of it. The king  has nothing like it.\"    \"No,\" answered Porthos, \"I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the  cardinal, Monsieur de Mazarin. Taste this cutlet, my dear D'Artagnan;  'tis off one of my sheep.\"    \"You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it.\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Yes, the sheep are fed in my meadows, which are excellent pasture.\"    \"Give me another cutlet.\"    \"No, try this hare, which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens.\"    \"Zounds! what a flavor!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"ah! they are fed on thyme  only, your hares.\"    \"And how do you like my wine?\" asked Porthos; \"it is pleasant, isn't  it?\"    \"Capital!\"    \"It is nothing, however, but a wine of the country.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Yes, a small declivity to the south, yonder on my hill, gives me twenty  hogsheads.\"    \"Quite a vineyard, hey?\"    Porthos sighed for the fifth time--D'Artagnan had counted his sighs. He  became curious to solve the problem.    \"Well now,\" he said, \"it seems, my dear friend, that something vexes  you; you are ill, perhaps? That health, which----\"    \"Excellent, my dear friend; better than ever. I could kill an ox with a  blow of my fist.\"    \"Well, then, family affairs, perhaps?\"    \"Family! I have, happily, only myself in the world to care for.\"    \"But what makes you sigh?\"  "]]]
