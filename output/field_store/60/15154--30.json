At Dale End there was a somewhat similar  erection known as the \"Welsh Cross,\" taking its peculiar name, says  Hutton, from the locality then called \"Welsh End,\" on account of the  number of Welsh people living on that side of the town; though why the  \"Taffies\" were honoured with a distinct little market house of their own  is not made clear. This building was taken down in 1803, the 3-dial  clock, weathercock, &c., being advertised for sale, October 12, 1802.    ~Crown.~--The old Crown Inn, Deritend, is one of the very few specimens  we have of the style of architecture adopted in the days of old, when  timber was largely used in place of our modern bricks. Leland mentions  the Crown Inn as existing in 1538, and a much longer history than that  is claimed for it. In 1817 there was another Old Crown Inn in New  Street, on the spot where Hyam's now stands, access to the Cherry  Orchard being had through its yard, the right of way thus obtained being  the origin of the present Union Passage.    ~Crystal Palaces.~--It was proposed in August, 1853, that the  Corporation should join with the Midland Railway Co. and the Corporation  of Sutton in the erection of a \"Sydenham Palace\" in Sutton Park:  Birmingham to lease 250 acres for 999 years, at 1s. per acre, find from  L20,000 to L30,000 for the building and divide profits, the Midland  Railway Co. being willing to make branch from Bromford and run cheap  trains. The scheme was highly approved, but the Suttonites killed the  goose that was to lay them such golden eggs by refusing to lease the  land for more than ninety-nine years and wanting 20s. per acre rent. In  July, 1877, a \"Sutton Park Crystal Palace Co. (Lim.)\" was registered,  with a capital of L25,000 in L5 shares, for buying Mr. Cole's Promenade  Gardens, erecting Hotel, Aquarium, Skating Rink, Concert Hall, Winter  Gardens, &c., and the shares were readily taken up. Additional grounds  were purchased, and though the original plans have not yet been all  carried out, a very pleasant resort is to be found there. Day's, in  Smallbrook Street, is also called a \"Crystal Palace,\" on account of the  style of decoration, and the immense mirror the proprietor purchased  from the Hyde Park Exhibition of 1851.    ~Curzon Hall~, built originally for the purposes of the Dog Shows, was  opened in 1865. It is the property of a company, and cost about L7,500.  The building is well suited and has been often used for exhibitions,  panoramas, circus entertainments, &c., the hall being 103 ft. long by 91  ft. wide; the stage is of the fullest width, with a depth of 45 ft.  There is room for 3,000 seats.    ~Danielites.~--A tribe who eschew fish, flesh, and fowl, and drink no  alcohol; neither do they snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco. At a fruit  banquet, held on August, 1877, it was decided to organise a \"Garden of  Danielites\" in Birmingham.    ~Dates.~--The most complete work giving the dates of all the leading  events in the world's history is \"Haydn's Book of Dates,\" the latest  edition bringing them down to 1882. For local events, the only \"Local  Book of Dates\" published is that of 1874, but \"Showell's Dictionary of  Birmingham\" (by the same author), will be found to contain more reliable  data than any book hitherto issued. For information of a general  character, respecting the immediate neighbourhood and adjoining  counties, our readers cannot do better than refer to the files of  Birmingham newspapers, preserved in the Reference Library, or write to  the present editors of the said papers, gentlemen noted for their  urbanity, and readiness to tell anybody anything.    ~Dawson,~ George, _See \"Parsons, Preachers, and Priests_,\" and  \"_Statues_.\"    ~Deaf and Dumb Asylum.~--_See \"Philanthropic Institutions_.\"    ~Debating Societies.~--From time immemorial the Brums have had their  little Parliaments, mostly in public-house parlours and clubrooms, and  certain Sunday nights gathering at \"Bob Edmonds\" and other well-known  houses have acquired quite an historical interest; but the  regularly-constituted \"Spouting Clubs\" of the present day cannot claim a  very long existence, the Birmingham Debating Society having held their  first palaver on the 3rd of Dec., 1846. In 1855 they joined the  Edgbastonians. The latest of the kind started in 1884, is known as the  Birmingham Parliamentary Debating Society, and has its premier, parties,  and political fights, in proper Parliamentary style.    ~Deer Stealers.~--There was a taste for venison in more classes than one  in 1765, for it was found necessary to offer rewards for the detection  of those persons who stole the deer from Aston Park.    ~Dental Hospital.~--_See \"Hospitals_.\"    ~Deodands.~--Prior to the passing of 9 and 10 Vict., 1846, Coroner's  Juries had the power of imposing a \"deodand\" or penalty on any article  or animal which had been instrumental in causing the death of a human  being, the said animal or article being forfeited if the owner did not  pay.    ~Deritend.~--In some antique records the name has been spelt  \"Duratehend.\" For this and other reasons it has been thought to have had  its origin rather from the ancient British, as \"dur\" is still the Welsh  word for water, and its situation on the Rea (a Gaelic word signifying a  running stream) seems to give a little foundation therefor. Mr. Tonlmin  Smith, in whose family the \"Old Crown House\" has descended from the time  it was built, and who, therefore, is no mean authority, was of opinion  that the name was formerly \"Der-yat-end,\" or \"Deer-Gate-End,\" from the  belief that in ancient days there was here an ancient deer forest.  Leland said he entered the town by \"Dirtey,\" so perhaps after all  Deritend only means \"the dirty end.\" Like the name of the town itself,  as well as several other parts of it, we can only guess at the origin.    ~Deritend Bridge.~--Old records show that some centuries back there was  a bridge here of some sort, and occasionally we find notes of payments  made for repairs to the roads leading to the gates of the bridge, or to  the watchmen who had charge thereof, who appear to have been in the  habit of locking the gates at night, a procedure which we fear our  \"Dirtyent\" neighbours of to-day would be inclined to resent. The Act for  building the present bridge was obtained in 1784; the work was commenced  in 1789, but not completed till 1814.    ~Dickens,~ Charles, made his first appearance amongst us at a  Polytechnic Conversazione held February 28, 1844, his last visit being  to distribute prizes to students of the Midland Institute, January 6,  1870. In December, 1854, he gave the proceeds of three \"Readings,\"  amounting to L227, to the funds of the Institute, in which he always  took great interest.--_See also \"Theatrical Notes,\" &c._    ~Digbeth,~ or Dyke Path, or Ducks' Bath, another puzzle to the  antiquarians. It was evidently a watery place, and the pathway lay low,  as may be seen at \"Ye Olde Leather Bottel.\"    ~Dining Halls.~--Our grandfathers were content to take their bread and  cheese by the cosy fireside of a public-house kitchen; this was followed  by sundry publicans reserving a better room, in which a joint was served  up for their \"topping customers.\" One who got into trouble and lost his  license, conceived the idea of opposing his successor, and started  dining-rooms, sending out for beer as it was required, but _not_ to his  old shop. This innovation took, and when the railways began bringing in  their streams of strangers, these dining-rooms paid well (as several of  the old ones do still). The next step was the opening of a large room in  Slaney Street (June 8, 1863), and another in Cambridge Street, with the  imposing title of \"Dining Halls,\" wherein all who were hungry could be  fed at wholesale prices--provided they had the necessary cash. Our  people, however, are not sufficiently gregarious to relish this kind of  feeding in flocks, barrackroom fashion, and though the provisions were  good and cheap, the herding together of all sorts spoilt the  speculation, and Dining Halls closed when \"Restaurants\" opened.--See  \"_Luncheon Bars_.\"    ~Diocese.~--Birmingham is in the diocese of Worcester, and in the  Archdeaconry of Coventry.    ~Directories.~--The oldest Birmingham Directory known was printed in  1770, but there had been one advertised a few years earlier, and every  now and then, after this date one or other of our few printers ventured  to issue what they called a directory, but the procuring a complete list  of all and every occupation carried on in Birmingham appears to have  been a feat beyond their powers, even sixty years back. As far as they  did go, however, the old directories are not uninteresting, as they give  us glimpses of trade mutations and changes compared with the present  time that appear strange now even to our oldest inhabitants. Place for  instance the directory of 1824 by the side of White's directory for 1874  (one of the most valuable and carefully compiled works of the kind yet  issued). In the former we find the names of 4,980 tradesmen, the  different businesses under which they are allotted numbering only 141;  in 1874 the trades and professions named tot up to 745, under which  appears no less than 33,462 names. In 1824, if we are to believe the  directory, there were no factors here, no fancy repositories, no  gardeners or florists, no pearl button makers, no furniture brokers or  pawnbrokers (!), no newsagents, and, strange to say, no printer.  Photographers and electro-platers were unknown, though fifty years after  showed 68 of the one, and 77 of the latter. On the other hand, in 1824,  there were 78 auger, awlblade and gimlet makers, against 19 in 1874; 14  bellows makers, against 5; 36 buckle and 810 button makers, against 10  and 265; 52 edge tool makers and 176 locksmiths, against 18 of each in  1874; hinge-makers were reduced from 53 to 23; gilt toy makers, from 265  to 15. (Considering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#20)"],[1,"sandy shores  of Grand Havre and L'Ancresse Bay seemed to be their head  breeding-quarters in Guernsey. Though I only found one set of eggs in  Grand Havre, I am sure there were three or four pairs of birds breeding  there; the two eggs I found were lying with their thick ends just  touching each other and half buried in sand; there was no nest whatever,  not even the sand hollowed out; they were in quite a bare place, just,  and only just, above the high-water line of seaweed. I should not have  found these if it had not been for the tracks of the birds immediately  round them. In L'Ancresse Bay I was not equally fortunate, but there  were quite as many pairs of birds breeding there. In Herm the  shell-beach seems to be their head breeding-quarters, and there Mr.  Howard Saunders, Colonel l'Estrange and myself found several sets of  eggs, generally three in number, but in one or two instances four: these  were probably hard-sat; in one instance, with four eggs, the eggs were  nearly upright in the sand, the small end being buried, and the thick  end just showing above the sand. In no instance in which I saw the eggs  was there the slightest attempt at a nest; but Colonel l'Estrange told  me that in one instance, in which he had found some eggs a day or two  before I got to Guernsey, quite the end of May, he found there was a  slight attempt at a nest, a few bents of the rough herbage which grew in  the sand just above high-water mark having been collected and the nest  lined with them. I have not found any eggs in Alderney, but I have no  doubt they breed in some of the sandy bays to the north of the Island  occasionally, if not always, as I have seen them there in the  breeding-season, both in 1876 and in 1866. This summer (1878) I was so  short a time in that Island that I had not time to search the most  likely places, but Captain Hubbach wrote me--\"I do not think the Kentish  Plover remained here to breed this year, although I saw some about in  April.\"    Professor Ansted includes the Kentish Plover in his list, but only marks  it as occurring in Guernsey. There is one specimen, a male, in the  Museum.      108. TURNSTONE. _Strepsilas interpres_, Linnaeus. French, \"Tourne  pierre,\" \"Tourne pierre a collier.\" The cosmopolitan Turnstone is  resident in the Channel Islands; throughout the year its numbers,  however, are much increased in the autumn by migrants, many of which  remain throughout the winter, leaving the Islands for their  breeding-stations in the spring. Some of those that remain throughout  the summer I have no doubt breed in the Islands, as I have seen the old  birds about with their young and shot one in July; and on the 8th of  June, 1876, I saw a pair in full breeding plumage in L'Ancresse Bay; I  saw them again about the same place on the 16th: these birds were  evidently paired, and I believe had eggs or young on a small rocky  island about two or three hundred yards from the land, but there was no  boat about, and so I could not get over to look for the eggs. Col.  l'Estrange obtained some eggs on one of the rocky islands to the north  of Herm, which certainly were not Tern's eggs as he supposed, and I  believe them to have been Turnstone's; unluckily he did not take the  eggs himself, but the boatman who was with him took them, so he did not  see the bird go off the nest. This last summer (1878) I was in hopes of  being more successful either in Guernsey itself or in Herm, or the rocks  near there, but I did not see a single Turnstone alive the whole time I  was in Guernsey. I think it very likely, however, I should have been  successful in Herm, as I visited it several times both by myself and  with Col. l'Estrange and Mr. Howard Saunders; our first visit was on  June the 21st, when we did not see a single Turnstone; but this was  afterwards accounted for, as on a visit to Jago, the bird-stuffer, a  short time afterwards, I found him skinning a splendid pair of  Turnstones which had been shot in Herm a few days before our visit on  the 17th or 18th of June; the female had eggs ready for extrusion; I  need not say I did not exactly bless the person who, in defiance of the  Guernsey Sea Birds Act, had shot this pair of Turnstones, as had they  been left I have no doubt we should have seen them, and probably found  the eggs, and quite settled the question of the Turnstone's breeding  there. I have long been very sceptical on this subject, but now I have  very little doubt, as I think, seeing the birds about, paired, in  Guernsey in June and the pair shot in Herm, the female with eggs in  June, pretty well removes any doubt as to the Turnstone breeding in the  Islands, and I do not see why it should not, as it breeds quite as far  south in the Azores, and almost certainly in the Canaries.[18] Mr. Rodd,  however, tells me he does not believe in its breeding in the Scilly  Islands, though it is seen about there throughout the year, as it is in  the Channel Islands. Mr. Gallienne, in his remarks on Professor Ansted's  list, merely says, \"The Turnstone is found about the neighbourhood of  Herm throughout the year.\" It occurs also in Alderney in the autumn, but  I have not seen it there in the breeding-season.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, but only marks it as occurring  in Guernsey. There are a male and female, in breeding plumage, in the  Museum, and also one in winter plumage.      109. OYSTERCATCHER, _Haematopus ostralegus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Hiutrier  pie.\"--The Guernsey Bird Act includes these birds under the name  'Piesmarans,' which is the name given to the Oystercatcher by all the  French-speaking fishermen and boatmen, and which I suppose must be  looked upon only as the local name, though I have no doubt it is the  common name also on the neighbouring coast of Normandy and Brittany. The  Oystercatcher is resident all the year, and breeds in all the Islands; I  think, however, its numbers are considerably increased in the autumn by  migratory arrivals; certainly the numbers actually breeding in the  Islands are not sufficient to account for the immense flocks one sees  about in October and November. There seem, however, to be considerable  numbers remaining in flocks throughout the summer, without apparently  the slightest intention of separating for breeding purposes, as I have  often counted as many as forty or fifty together in June and July. The  Oystercatcher breeds in Guernsey itself about the cliffs. Mr. Howard  Saunders, Colonel l'Estrange and myself found one very curiously placed  nest of the Oystercatcher on the ridge of a hog-backed rock at the  bottom of the cliff, near the south end of the Island; it was not much  above high-water mark, and quite within reach of heavy spray when there  was any sea on: we could distinctly see the eggs when looking down from  the cliffs on them, and the two old birds were walking about the ridge  of rock as if dancing on the tight-rope; how they kept their eggs in  place on that narrow ridge, exposed as it was to wind and sea, was a  marvel. The Oystercatcher breeds also in both the small Islands, Jethou  and Herm, on almost all the rocky islands to the north of Herm, in Sark  and Alderney, and on Burhou, near Alderney, where I found one clutch of  three of the most richly marked Oystercatcher's eggs I ever saw: these,  as well as another clutch, also of three eggs, were placed on rather  curious nests; they were on the smooth rock, but in both cases the birds  had collected a number of small stones and made a complete pavement of  them, on which they placed their eggs; there was no protection, however,  to prevent the eggs from rolling off. Both in Burhou as well as on the  Amfroques and other rocks to the north of Herm, the eggs of the  Oystercatchers, as well as of the other sea-birds breeding there, had  been ruthlessly robbed by fishermen and others, who occasionally visit  these wild rocks and carry off everything in the shape of an egg,  without paying any respect to the Bird Act, which professes to protect  the eggs as well as the birds.    Professor Ansted includes the Oystercatcher in his list, but only marks  it as occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is an Oystercatcher and also  a few of the eggs in the Museum.      110. CURLEW. _Numenins arquata_, Linnaeus. French, \"Courlis,\" \"Grand  courlis cendre.\"--A good many Curlews are to be found in the Islands  throughout the year, but I do not believe any of them breed there; I  have seen them in Guernsey, Jethou, Herm and Alderney, all through the  summer, but always in flocks on the mud and seaweed below high-water  mark, whenever they can be there, searching for food, and quite as wild  and wary as in the winter. I have never seen them paired, or in any  place the least likely for them to be breeding. I know Mr. Gallienne, in  his remarks to Professor Ansted's list, says, \"Although I have never  heard of the eggs of either the Curlew or Whimbrel being found, I am  satisfied they breed here (I think at Herm), as they stay with us  throughout the year.\" I cannot from my observation agree with this  supposition of the Curlew breeding in the Islands; nor can I agree with  the statement made by a writer in 'Cassel's Magazine' for June or July,  1878, that he found a young Curlew in the down on one of the Islands  near Jethou, probably from the description 'La Fauconniere.' The writer  of this paper in 'Cassel's Magazine' was evidently no ornithologist,  and must, I think, have mistaken a young Oystercatcher, of which  several pairs were breeding there at the time, for a young Curlew; his  description of the cry of the old birds as they flew round was much more  like that of the Oystercatcher than the Curlew. All of the boatmen also,  with whom I have been about at various times, agree that the Curlews do  not breed in the Islands, though they are quite aware that they remain  throughout the year, and as many of them, in spite of the Guernsey Bird  Act,"]]]
