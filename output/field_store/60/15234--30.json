(#20)"],[1," much devoted to study, he was  perhaps too negligent in those endearments and tender intercourses of  love which a wife has a right to expect. No lady ever yet was fond of  a scholar, who could not join the lover with it; and he who expects to  secure the affections of his wife by the force of his understanding  only, will find himself miserably mistaken: indeed it is no wonder  that women who are formed for tenderness, and whose highest excellence  is delicacy, should pay no great reverence to a proud scholar, who  considers the endearments of his wife, and the caresses of his  children as pleasures unworthy of him. It is agreed by all the  biographers of Milton, that he was not very tender in his disposition;  he was rather boldly honourable, than delicately kind; and Mr. Dryden  seems to insinuate, that he was not much subject to love. \"His rhimes,  says he, flow stiff from him, and that too at an age when love makes  every man a rhymster, tho' not a poet. There are, methinks, in  Milton's love-sonnets more of art than nature; he seems to have  considered the passion philosophically, rather than felt it  intimately.\"    In reading Milton's gallantry the breast will glow, but feel no  palpitations; we admire the poetry, but do not melt with tenderness;  and want of feeling in an author seldom fails to leave the reader  cold; but from whatever cause his aversion proceeded, she was at last  prevailed upon by her relations, who could foresee the dangers of a  matrimonial quarrel, to make a submission, and she was again received  with tenderness.    Mr. Philips has thus related the story.--'It was then generally  thought, says he, that Milton had a design of marrying one of Dr.  Davy's daughters, a very handsome and witty gentlewoman, but averse,  as it is said, to this motion; however the intelligence of this caused  justice Powel's family to let all engines at work to restore the  married woman to the station in which they a little before had planted  her. At last this device was pitched upon. There dwelt in the lane of  St. Martin's Le Grand, which was hard by, a relation of our author's,  one Blackborough, whom it was known he often visited, and upon this  occasion the visits were more narrowly observed, and possibly there  might be a combination between both parties, the friends on both sides  consenting in the same action, tho' in different behalfs. One time  above the rest, making his usual visits, his wife was ready in another  room; on a sudden he was surprized to see one, whom he thought never  to have seen more, making submission, and begging pardon on her knees  before him. He might probably at first make some shew of aversion, and  rejection, but partly his own generous nature, more inclinable to  reconciliation than to perseverance in anger and revenge, and partly  the strong intercession of friends on both sides, soon brought him to  an act of oblivion and a firm league of peace for the future; and it  was at length concluded that she should remain at a friend's house,  till he was settled in his new house in Barbican, and all things  prepared for her reception. The first fruits of her return to her  husband was a brave girl, born within a year after, tho', whether by  ill constitution, or want of care, she grew more and more decrepit.'    Mr. Fenton observes, that it is not to be doubted but the  abovementioned interview between Milton and his wife must wonderfully  affect him; and that perhaps the impressions it made on his  imagination contributed much to the painting of that pathetic scene in  Paradise Lost, b. 10. in which Eve addresses herself to Adam for  pardon and peace, now at his feet submissive in distress.    About the year 1644 our author wrote a small piece in one sheet 4to,  under this title, Education, to Mr. Samuel Hartly, reprinted at the  end of his Poems on several occasions; and in the same year he  published at London in 4to, his Areopagitica, or a speech of Mr. J.  Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing, to the Parliament of  England.    In 1645 his Juvenile Poems were printed at London, and about this time  his zeal for the republican party had so far recommended him, that a  design was formed of making him adjutant-general in Sir William  Waller's army; but the new modelling the army proved an obstruction to  that advancement. Soon after the march of Fairfax and Cromwell with  the whole army through the city, in order to suppress the insurrection  which Brown and Massey were endeavouring to raise there, against the  army's proceedings, he left his great house in Barbican, for a smaller  in High Holborn, where he prosecuted his studies till after the King's  trial and death, when he published his Tenure of Kings and  Magistrates: His Observations on the Articles of peace between James  Earl of Ormond for King Charles I. on the one hand, and the Irish  Rebels and Papists on the other hand; and a letter sent by Ormond to  colonel Jones governor of Dublin; and a representation of the Scotch  Presbytery at Belfast in Ireland.    He was now admitted into the service of the Commonwealth, and was made  Latin Secretary to the Council of State, who resolved neither to write  nor receive letters but in the Latin tongue, which was common to all  states.    'And it were to be wished,' says Dr. Newton, 'that succeeding Princes  would follow their example, for in the opinion of very wise men, the  universality of the French language will make way for the universality  of the French Monarchy. Milton was perhaps the first instance of a  blind man's possessing the place of a secretary; which no doubt was a  great inconvenience to him in his business, tho' sometimes a political  use might be made of it, as men's natural infirmities are often  pleaded in excuse for their not doing what they have no great  inclination to do. Dr. Newton relates an instance of this. When  Cromwell, as we may collect from Whitlocke, for some reasons delayed  artfully to sign the treaty concluded with Sweden, and the Swedish  ambassador made frequent complaints of it, it was excused to him,  because Milton on account of his blindness, proceeded slower in  business, and had not yet put the articles of treaty into Latin. Upon  which the ambassador was greatly surprized that things of such  consequence should be entrusted to a blind man; for he must  necessarily employ an amanuensis, and that amanuensis might divulge  the articles; and said, it was very wonderful there should be only one  man in England who could write Latin, and he a blind one.'    Thus we have seen Milton raised to the dignity of Latin Secretary. It  is somewhat strange, that in times of general confusion, when a man of  parts has the fairest opportunity to play off his abilities to  advantage, that Milton did not rise sooner, nor to a greater  elevation; he was employed by those in authority only as a writer,  which conferred no power upon him, and kept him in a kind of  obscurity, who had from nature all that was proper for the field as  well as the cabinet; for we are assured that Milton was a man of  confirmed courage.    In 1651 our author published his Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio, for  which he was rewarded by the Commonwealth with a present of a thousand  pounds, and had a considerable hand in correcting and polishing a  piece written by his nephew Mr. John Philips, and printed at London  1652, under this title, Joannis Philippi Angli Responsio ad Apologiam  Anonymi cujusdam Tenebrionis pro Rege & Populo Anglicano  infantissimam. During the writing and publishing this book, he lodged  at one Thomson's, next door to the Bull-head tavern Charing-Cross; but  he soon removed to a Garden-house in Petty-France, next door to lord  Scudamore's, where he remained from the year 1652 till within a few  weeks of the Restoration. In this house, his first wife dying in  child-bed, 1652, he married a second, Catherine, the daughter of  Captain Woodcock of Hackney, who died of a consumption in three months  after she had been brought to bed of a daughter. This second marriage  was about two or three years after he had been wholly deprived of his  sight; for by reason of his continual studies, and the head-ach[e], to  which he was subject from his youth, and his perpetual tampering with  physic, his eyes had been decaying for twelve years before.    In 1654 he published his Defensio Secunda; and the year following his  Defensio pro Se. Being now at ease from his state adversaries, and  political controversies, he had leisure again to prosecute his own  studies, and private designs, particularly his History of Britain, and  his new Thesaurus Linguae Latinae according to the method of Robert  Stevens, the manuscript of which contained three large volumes in  folio, and has been made use of by the editors of the Cambridge  Dictionary, printed 4to, 1693.    In 1658 he published Sir Walter Raleigh's Cabinet Council; and in 1659  a Treatise of the Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes, Lond. 12mo.  and Considerations touching the likeliest Means to remove Hirelings  out of the Church; wherein are also Discourses of Tithes, Church-fees,  Church-Revenues, and whether any Maintenance of Ministers can be  settled in Law, Lond. 1659, 12mo.    Upon the dissolution of the Parliament by the army, after Richard  Cromwell had been obliged to resign the Protectorship, Milton wrote a  letter, in which he lays down the model of a commonwealth; not such as  he judged the best, but what might be the readiest settled at that  time, to prevent the restoration of kingly government and domestic  disorders till a more favourable season, and better dispositions for  erecting a perfect democracy. He drew up likewise another piece to the  same purpose, which seems to have been addressed to general Monk; and  he published in February 1659, his ready and easy way to establish a  free Commonwealth. Soon after this he published his brief notes upon a  late sermon, entitled,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#20)"],[1,"1, 1884 \"    \"  31, 1885 ...  161,596 ...  184,820      \"   1, 1885 \"    \"  31, 1886 ...  177,877 ...  162,709 Sheba floated.      \"   1, 1886 \"  Dec. 31, 1886 ...  196,236 ...  154,636 Rand proclaimed                                                              Sept. 8, 1886.

The figures for the period from 1871 to the end of 1887 are taken  from Jeppe's Transvaal Almanac for 1889. They represent the  ordinary Revenue and Expenditure arrived at after the deduction  of the items 'Special Receipts,' 'Special Deposits,' 'Deposits  Withdrawn,' 'Advance Refunded,' 'Advances made' and 'Fixed Deposits'  from the totals given in the Official Government Returns.    The figures for the years 1888 to 1899 are those of the published  Government Returns after the deduction of--    Fixed deposits from 1888 to 1893 inclusive.    The sale and purchase of explosives from 1895 to 1898 inclusive.    The owner's share of claim licenses from 1895 to 1899 inclusive.    Delagoa Bay Customs Dues paid to the Netherlands Railway for 1898 and  1899.    [Dynamite Monopoly.]    The dynamite monopoly has always been a Monopoly very burning  question with the Uitlanders. This concession was granted shortly  after the Barberton Fields were discovered, when the prospects of an  industry in the manufacture of explosives were not really very great.  The concessionaire himself has admitted that had he foreseen to what  proportions this monopoly would eventually grow he would not have had  the audacity to apply for it. This, of course, is merely a personal  question. The fact which concerned the industry was that the right  was granted to one man to manufacture explosives and to sell them at  a price nearly 200 per cent. over that at which they could be  imported. It was found upon investigation after some years of  agitation that the factory at which this 'manufacture' took place was  in reality merely a depot in which the already manufactured article  was manipulated to a moderate extent so as to lend colour to the  President's statement that a local industry was being fostered. An  investigation held by order of the Volksraad exposed the imposition.  The President himself stated that he found he had been deceived and  that the terms of the concession had been broken, and he urged the  Raad to cancel it--which the Raad did. The triumph was considerable  for the mining industry and it was the more appreciated in that it  was the solitary success to which the Uitlanders could point in their  long series of agitations for reform. But the triumph was not  destined to be a lasting one. Within a few months the monopoly was  revived in an infinitely more obnoxious form. It was now called a  Government monopoly, but 'the agency' was bestowed upon a partner of  the gentleman who had formerly owned the concession, the President  himself vigorously defending this course and ignoring his own  judgment on the case uttered a few months previously. _Land en Volk_,  the Pretoria Dutch newspaper, exposed the whole of this transaction,  including the system of bribery by which the concessionaries secured  their renewal, and among other things made the charge which it has  continued to repeat ever since that Mr. J.M.A. Wolmarans, member  of the Executive, received a commission of one shilling per case  on every case sold during the continuance of the agency as a  consideration for his support in the Executive Council, and that he  continues to enjoy this remuneration, which is estimated now to be  not far short of L10,000 a year. Mr. Wolmarans, for reasons of pride  or discretion, has declined to take any notice of the charge,  although frequently pressed to take action in the matter. It is  calculated that the burden imposed upon the Witwatersrand Mines alone  amounts to L600,000 per annum, and is, of course, daily increasing.    [The Franchise Laws.]    The question of the franchise, which has achieved the greatest  prominence in the Uitlander agitation, is one with which few people  even in the Transvaal are familiar, so many and peculiar have been  the changes effected in the law. Lawyers differ as to whether certain  laws revoke or merely supplement previous ones, and the President  himself--to the grim amusement of the Uitlanders--frequently goes  astray when he speaks on franchise. The first law on burgher and  electoral rights is No. 1 of 1876, which remained in force until  1882. By it the possession of landed property or else residence for  one year qualified the settler for full burgher privileges. Law No. 7  of 1882 was the first attempt of the restored Republic to deal with  the question. It was then enacted that an alien could be naturalized  and enfranchised after five years' residence, such residence to be  proved by the Field-cornet's books of registration. It has already  been explained that these records in nine cases out of ten were  either improperly kept or non-existent.    In 1890 Law No. 4 was passed, creating the Second Volksraad and  altering the Grondwet (or constitution) accordingly. By this law the  franchise was indirectly altered without repealing those portions  which may be at variance with or repugnant to the implied  alterations, and this was done by simply defining what class of  electors should vote for members of the First Raad, and what class  for members of the Second. Thus, 'the members of the First Volksraad  shall be elected by those enfranchised burghers who have obtained the  right of voting before this law comes in force, or thereafter by  birth in the State, and on having attained the age of sixteen years.'  Secondly, all those who became naturalized and enfranchised after  this law was passed could not vote for members of the First  Volksraad, but a subsequent article in the law provides that the  higher rights can be obtained by those who shall have been eligible  for ten years for election to the Second Volksraad; and it is then  explained that, in order to be eligible for the Second Volksraad,  it is necessary to be thirty years of age, to be a member of the  Protestant Church, to live and have landed property in the Republic,  and to have been a naturalized subject for two years. Thus the full  electoral privileges were only obtainable after fourteen years'  residence in the State, and the possession of the other  qualifications of religion, property, etc.    Next came Law No. 13 of 1891, which was rather a codification than an  alteration of previous laws. In 1892 another law was passed again  explaining, but not materially altering the franchise. In 1893 Law  No. 14 was passed as an amendment of previous laws: further juggling  the position--further hedging in the sacred preserve. As the law was  superseded in the following year it is unnecessary to go into  details; but note how the measure became law! It was not published in  the _Staats Courant_ for three months as required by law; it was not  published at all; nor was any special resolution taken affirming that  it was a matter of extreme urgency and therefore to be held exempt  from that rule of procedure; so that the High Court ought to be able  to declare it null and void. The circumstances of its introduction  could not be considered to warrant the plea of urgency. On the 29th  and 30th June, 1893, memorials upon the franchise question were laid  before the Raad. From Johannesburg came one memorial bearing 4,507  signatures out of the grand total of 6,665 memorialists. It was in  favour of _extension_ of the franchise. Another memorial from 103  Free State burghers was in favour of _extension_, another from  Barberton from 40 burghers also for _extension_. Seven memorials,  bearing 444 signatures, were _against_ extension. All the others  concerned minor alterations in Law 13 of 1891, and did not affect  the franchise. The Raad appointed a commission and on the 8th of  September received its report, together with a draft law which had  not before seen the light of day. After a discussion lasting part of  one morning the law was passed provisionally; and to be of full force  and effect until confirmed by the Raad in the following year. Thus  again were the fundamental political conditions entirely altered by  the passing of a law which _two hours before_ had not been heard of.    Law No. 3 of 1894 purports to supersede all other laws. Therein it is  laid down that all persons born in the State, or who may have  established their"]]]
