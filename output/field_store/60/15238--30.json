There is  surely a strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this. It may  be said, indeed, that without bones and muscles and the other parts  of the body I cannot execute my purposes. But to say that I do as I do  because of them, and that this is the way in which mind acts, and  not from the choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of  speaking. I wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the  condition, which the many, feeling about in the dark, are always  mistaking and misnaming. And thus one man makes a vortex all round and  steadies the earth by the heaven; another gives the air as a support to  the earth, which is a sort of broad trough. Any power which in arranging  them as they are arranges them for the best never enters into their  minds; and instead of finding any superior strength in it, they rather  expect to discover another Atlas of the world who is stronger and more  everlasting and more containing than the good;--of the obligatory and  containing power of the good they think nothing; and yet this is the  principle which I would fain learn if any one would teach me. But as I  have failed either to discover myself, or to learn of any one else,  the nature of the best, I will exhibit to you, if you like, what I have  found to be the second best mode of enquiring into the cause.    I should very much like to hear, he replied.    Socrates proceeded:--I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation  of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of  my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing  on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only  looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium.  So in my own case, I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether  if I looked at things with my eyes or tried to apprehend them by the  help of the senses. And I thought that I had better have recourse to the  world of mind and seek there the truth of existence. I dare say that  the simile is not perfect--for I am very far from admitting that he who  contemplates existences through the medium of thought, sees them only  'through a glass darkly,' any more than he who considers them in action  and operation. However, this was the method which I adopted: I first  assumed some principle which I judged to be the strongest, and then I  affirmed as true whatever seemed to agree with this, whether relating  to the cause or to anything else; and that which disagreed I regarded  as untrue. But I should like to explain my meaning more clearly, as I do  not think that you as yet understand me.    No indeed, replied Cebes, not very well.    There is nothing new, he said, in what I am about to tell you; but  only what I have been always and everywhere repeating in the previous  discussion and on other occasions: I want to show you the nature of that  cause which has occupied my thoughts. I shall have to go back to those  familiar words which are in the mouth of every one, and first of all  assume that there is an absolute beauty and goodness and greatness, and  the like; grant me this, and I hope to be able to show you the nature of  the cause, and to prove the immortality of the soul.    Cebes said: You may proceed at once with the proof, for I grant you  this.    Well, he said, then I should like to know whether you agree with me  in the next step; for I cannot help thinking, if there be anything  beautiful other than absolute beauty should there be such, that it can  be beautiful only in as far as it partakes of absolute beauty--and I  should say the same of everything. Do you agree in this notion of the  cause?    Yes, he said, I agree.    He proceeded: I know nothing and can understand nothing of any other of  those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person says to me that  the bloom of colour, or form, or any such thing is a source of beauty,  I leave all that, which is only confusing to me, and simply and singly,  and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my own mind that nothing  makes a thing beautiful but the presence and participation of beauty in  whatever way or manner obtained; for as to the manner I am uncertain,  but I stoutly contend that by beauty all beautiful things become  beautiful. This appears to me to be the safest answer which I can give,  either to myself or to another, and to this I cling, in the persuasion  that this principle will never be overthrown, and that to myself or  to any one who asks the question, I may safely reply, That by beauty  beautiful things become beautiful. Do you not agree with me?    I do.    And that by greatness only great things become great and greater  greater, and by smallness the less become less?    True.    Then if a person were to remark that A is taller by a head than B, and  B less by a head than A, you would refuse to admit his statement, and  would stoutly contend that what you mean is only that the greater is  greater by, and by reason of, greatness, and the less is less only by,  and by reason of, smallness; and thus you would avoid the danger of  saying that the greater is greater and the less less by the measure of  the head, which is the same in both, and would also avoid the monstrous  absurdity of supposing that the greater man is greater by reason of the  head, which is small. You would be afraid to draw such an inference,  would you not?    Indeed, I should, said Cebes, laughing.    In like manner you would be afraid to say that ten exceeded eight by,  and by reason of, two; but would say by, and by reason of, number; or  you would say that two cubits exceed one cubit not by a half, but by  magnitude?-for there is the same liability to error in all these cases.    Very true, he said.    Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that the addition of  one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two? And you would  loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes  into existence except by participation in its own proper essence,  and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is  the participation in duality--this is the way to make two, and the  participation in one is the way to make one. You would say: I will let  alone puzzles of division and addition--wiser heads than mine may answer  them; inexperienced as I am, and ready to start, as the proverb says,  at my own shadow, I cannot afford to give up the sure ground of a  principle. And if any one assails you there, you would not mind him,  or answer him, until you had seen whether the consequences which follow  agree with one another or not, and when you are further required to give  an explanation of this principle, you would go on to assume a higher  principle, and a higher, until you found a resting-place in the best of  the higher; but you would not confuse the principle and the consequences  in your reasoning, like the Eristics--at least if you wanted to discover  real existence. Not that this confusion signifies to them, who never  care or think about the matter at all, for they have the wit to be well  pleased with themselves however great may be the turmoil of their ideas.  But you, if you are a philosopher, will certainly do as I say.    What you say is most true, said Simmias and Cebes, both speaking at  once.    ECHECRATES: Yes, Phaedo; and I do not wonder at their assenting. Any  one who has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clearness of  Socrates' reasoning.    PHAEDO: Certainly, Echecrates; and such was the feeling of the whole  company at the time.    ECHECRATES: Yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company,  and are now listening to your recital. But what followed?    PHAEDO: After all this had been admitted, and they had that ideas exist,  and that other things participate in them and derive their names from  them, Socrates, if I remember rightly, said:--    This is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that Simmias is  greater than Socrates and less than Phaedo, do you not predicate of  Simmias both greatness and smallness?    Yes, I do.    But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates, as  the words may seem to imply, because he is Simmias, but by reason of the  size which he has; just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates because he  is Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates, but because he  has smallness when compared with the greatness of Simmias?    True.    And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, this is not because Phaedo is  Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias, who is  comparatively smaller?    That is true.    And therefore Simmias is said to be great, and is also said to be small,  because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness of the one  by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other to exceed his  smallness. He added, laughing, I am speaking like a book, but I believe  that what I am saying is true.    Simmias assented.    I speak as I do because I want you to agree with me in thinking, not  only that absolute greatness will never be great and also small, but  that greatness in us or in the concrete will never admit the small or  admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one of two things will happen,  either the greater will fly or retire before the opposite, which is the  less, or at the approach of the less has already ceased to exist; but  will not, if allowing or admitting of smallness, be changed by that;  even as I, having received and admitted smallness when compared with  Simmias, remain just as I was, and am the same small person. And as the  idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to be or become small, in like  manner the smallness in us cannot be or become great; nor can any other "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#20)"],[1,"ardor.\"    Many incidents are on record of the gallantry of Negro soldiers and  servants also serving as soldiers, in the war with Mexico. Colonel Clay,  a son of Henry Clay, was accompanied into the thick of the battle of  Buena Vista, by his Negro servant. He remained by his side in the fatal  charge and saw Clay stricken from his horse. Although surrounded by the  murderous Mexicans he succeeded in carrying the mangled body of his  master from the field.    It has been stated and the evidence seems strong, that a Negro saved the  life of General Zachary Taylor at the battle of Monterey. The story is  that a Mexican was aiming a deadly blow at the General, when the Negro  sprang between them, slew the Mexican and received a deep wound from a  lance. The Negro was a slave at the time, but was afterwards emancipated  by President Taylor.    Upwards of 200,000 colored soldiers were regularly enlisted in the  Federal army and navy during the Civil war. President Lincoln  commissioned eight Negro surgeons for field and hospital duty. Losses  sustained by the Negro troops amounting to upwards of 37,000 men, are  shown to have been as heavy in proportion to the numbers engaged, as  those of the white forces.    The record of the Negro troops in the Civil war is one of uniform  excellence. Numerous official documents attest this fact, aside from the  spoken and written commendations of many high officers. Their bravery  was everywhere recognized; many distinguished themselves and several  attained to the rank of regularly commissioned officers. Conspicuous in  Negro annals of that time is the case of Charles E. Nash, afterwards a  member of congress. He received a primary education in the schools of  New Orleans, but had educated himself largely by his own efforts. In  1863 he enlisted in the 83rd regiment, United States Chasseurs d'Afrique  and became acting sergeant-major of that command. At the storming of  Fort Blakely he lost a leg and was honorably discharged.    Another, William Hannibal Thomas, afterwards became prominent as an  author, teacher, lawyer and legislator. His best known book was  entitled, \"The American Negro: What he was, what he is, and what he may  become.\" He served as a soldier during the Civil War and lost an arm in  the service.    The exploit of Robert Smalls was so brilliant that no amount of  unfairness or prejudice has been able to shadow it. It is well known to  all students of the War of the Rebellion and is recorded in the  imperishable pages of history.    Smalls was born a slave at Beaufort, South Carolina, but managed to  secure some education. Having led a sea-faring life to some extent, the  early part of the war found him employed as pilot of the Rebel transport  Planter. He was thoroughly familiar with the harbors and inlets of the  South Atlantic coast. On May 31, 1862, the Planter was in Charleston  harbor. All the white officers and crew went ashore, leaving on board a  colored crew of eight men in charge of Smalls. He summoned aboard his  wife and three children and at 2 o'clock in the morning steamed out of  the harbor, passed the Confederate forts by giving the proper signals,  and when fairly out of reach, ran up the Stars and Stripes and headed a  course for the Union fleet, into whose hands he soon surrendered the  ship. He was appointed a pilot in the United States navy and served as  such on the monitor Keokuk in the attack on Fort Sumter; was promoted to  captain for gallant and meritorious conduct, December 1, 1863, and  placed in command of the Planter, a position which he held until the  vessel was taken out of commission in 1866. He was a member of the South  Carolina Constitutional Convention, 1868; elected same year to the  legislature, to the state senate 1870 and 1872, and was a member of the  Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses.    Among the most inspiring pages of Civil War history written by the  Negro, were the campaigns of Port Hudson, Louisiana; Fort Wagner, South  Carolina and Fort Pillow, Kentucky. Negro troops participated in the  siege of the former place by the Federal forces under General Banks,  which began in May 1863, and ended in the surrender of the fort July 8,  1863. Fort Wagner was one of the defenses of Charleston. It was reduced  by General Gilmore, September 6,1863 and Negro troops contributed in a  glorious and heroic manner to the result. Fort Pillow had been taken by  the Federals and was garrisoned by a Negro regiment and a detachment of  cavalry. It was recaptured April 12, 1864 by the Confederates under  General Forrest. Practically the entire garrison was massacred, an act  that will stain forever the name of Forrest, and the cause for which he  struggled.    By the close of the Civil war, the value and fitness of the Negro as a  soldier had been so completely demonstrated that the government decided  to enlarge the Regular army and form fifty percent of the increase from  colored men. In 1866 eight new infantry regiments were authorized of  which four were to be Negroes and four new cavalry regiments of which  two were to be Negroes. The Negro infantry regiments were numbered the  38th 39th, 40th and 41st. The cavalry regiments were known as the 9th  and 10th.    In 1869 there was a general reduction in the infantry forces of the  Regular army and the 38th and 41st were consolidated into one regiment  numbered the 24th and the 39th and 40th into one regiment numbered the  25th. The strength and numerical titles of the cavalry were not changed.  For over forty years the colored American was represented in our Regular  Army by those four regiments. They have borne more than their  proportionate share of hard service, including many Indian campaigns.  The men have conducted themselves so worthily as to call forth the best  praise of the highest military authorities. General Miles and General  Merritt, actively identified with the Indian wars, were unstinting in  their commendation of the valor and skill of Negro fighters.    Between 1869 and 1889, three colored men were regularly graduated and  commissioned from the United States military academy at West Point and  served in the Regular Army as officers. They were John H. Alexander,  Charles Young and H.O. Flipper. The latter was dismissed. All served in  the cavalry. Alexander died shortly before the Spanish-American war and  up to the time of his demise, enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his  associates, white and black. Young became major in the volunteer service  during the Spanish-American war and was placed in command of the Ninth  Battalion of Ohio volunteers. After the Spanish-American war he returned  to the Regular Army with a reduced rank, but ultimately became a Major  in that service. Upon America's entry into the European war he was  elevated to the rank of Colonel.    At the breaking out of the Spanish-American war in 1898, Negro military  organizations existed principally in the Regular Army. These were soon  filled to their maximum strength and the desire of Negroes north and  south to enlist, seemed likely to meet with disappointment. Congress, to  meet the insistence of colored men for service, authorized the raising  of ten Negro volunteer regiments of \"immunes\"--men who had lived in  sections where the yellow fever and other malignant or malarial  visitations had occurred, and who had suffered from them or shown  evidences that they in all probability would be immune from the  diseases. The plan to place white men in all commands above the grade of  second lieutenant, prevented Negroes from enlisting as they otherwise  would have done. Four immune regiments were organized--the 7th, 8th, 9th  and 10th.    Several of the states appreciating the value of the Negro as a soldier  and in response to his intense desire to enlist, placed volunteer Negro  organizations at the disposal of the government. There were the Third  Alabama and Sixth Virginia Infantry; Eighth Illinois Infantry; Companies  A and B Indiana Infantry; Thirty-third Kansas Infantry, and a battalion  of the Ninth Ohio Infantry. The Eighth Illinois was officered by colored  men throughout. J.R. Marshall its first colonel commanded the regiment  during the Spanish-American war and did garrison duty in Santiago  province for some time after the war; being for a while military  governor of San Luis.    Gov. Russell of North Carolina, called out a Negro regiment, the Third  Infantry, officered by colored men throughout. Colonel Charles Young  commanding. It was not mustered into the service.    Company L. Sixth Massachusetts Infantry, was a Negro company serving in  a white regiment. John L. Waller, deceased, a Negro formerly United  States Consul to Madagascar, was a captain in the Kansas regiment.    About one hundred Negro second-lieutenants were commissioned in the  volunteer force during the Spanish-American war. There was a Negro  paymaster, Major John R. Lynch of Mississippi, and two Negro chaplains,  the Rev. C.T. Walker of Georgia and the Rev. Richard Carroll of South  Carolina.    Owing to the briefness of the campaign in Cuba, most of the service of  Negro troops devolved upon the Regulars who were fit and ready. But all  troops were at mobilization or training bases and willing and anxious to  serve. No pages in the history of this country are more replete with the  record of good fighting, military efficiency and soldierly conduct, than  those recording the story of Negro troops in Cuba. Colonel Roosevelt  said that the conduct of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry reflected honor  upon the whole American people, especially on their own race. He could  hardly say otherwise in view of the splendid support given by those two  regiments that--such is, and will continue to be the verdict of history,  saved him and his \"Rough Riders\" from annihilation at San Juan Hill.    Cuba, in her struggles for freedom, had among her own people two  splendid Negro leaders, Antonio and Jose Maceo."]]]
