Mr. Webb, however, has seen this appearance with such a  telescope, of moderate power, used with direct vision; and certainly I  can corroborate Mr. Howlett in the statement that this appearance may be  most distinctly seen when the image of the sun is received within a  well-darkened room.    My space will not permit me to enter here upon the discussion of any of  those interesting speculations which have been broached concerning solar  phenomena. We may hope that the great eclipse of August, 1868, which  promises to be the most favourable (for effective observation) that has  ever taken place, will afford astronomers the opportunity of resolving  some important questions. It seems as if we were on the verge of great  discoveries,--and certainly, if persevering and well-directed labour  would seem in any case to render such discoveries due as man's just  reward, we may well say that he deserves shortly to reap a harvest of  exact knowledge respecting solar phenomena.          THE END.        FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Such a telescope is most powerful with the shortest sight.  It may be remarked that the use of a telescope often reveals a  difference in the sight of the two eyes. In my own case, for instance, I  have found that the left eye is very short-sighted, the sight of the  right eye being of about the average range. Accordingly with my left eye  a 5-1/2-foot object-glass, alone, forms an effective telescope, with  which I can see Jupiter's moons quite distinctly, and under favourable  circumstances even Saturn's rings. I find that the full moon is too  bright to be observed in this way without pain, except at low  altitudes.]    [Footnote 2: Betelgeuse--commonly interpreted the Giant's  Shoulder--_ibt-al-jauza_. The words, however, really signify, \"the  armpit of the central one,\" Orion being so named because he is divided  centrally by the equator.]    [Footnote 3: I have never been able to see more than four with a  3-3/4-inch aperture. I give a view of the trapezium as seen with an  8-inch equatorial.]    [Footnote 4: Sir W. Herschel several times saw [epsilon] Lyrae as a  double. Bessel also relates that when he was a lad of thirteen he could  see this star double. I think persons having average eye-sight could see  it double if they selected a suitable hour for observation. My own  eye-sight is not good enough for this, but I can distinctly see this  star wedged whenever the line joining the components is inclined about  45 deg. to the horizon, and also when Lyra is near the zenith.]    [Footnote 5: They were so described by Admiral Smyth in 1839. Mr. Main,  in 1862, describes them as straw-coloured and reddish, while Mr. Webb,  in 1865, saw them pale-yellow and _lilac_!]    [Footnote 6: Or the observer may sweep from [omicron] towards [nu],  looking for R about two-fifths of the way from [omicron] to [nu].]    [Footnote 7: Here a single period only is taken, to get back to a  convenient hour of the evening.]    [Footnote 8: Here a single period only is taken, to get back to a  convenient hour of the evening.]    [Footnote 9: I have constructed a zodiac-chart, which will enable the  student to mark in the path of a planet, at any season of the year, from  the recorded places in the almanacs.]    [Footnote 10: It is convenient to remember that through precession a  star near the ecliptic shifts as respects the R.A. and Dec. lines,  through an arc of one degree--or nearly twice the moon's diameter--in  about 72 years, all other stars through a less arc.]    [Footnote 11: Mercury is best seen when in quadrature to the sun, but  _not_ (as I have seen stated) at those quadratures in which he attains  his maximum elongation from the sun. This will appear singular, because  the maximum elongation is about 27 deg., the minimum only about 18 deg.. But it  happens that in our northern latitudes Mercury is always _south_ of the  sun when he attains his maximum elongation, and this fact exercises a  more important effect than the mere amount of elongation.]    [Footnote 12: It does not seem to me that the difficulty of detecting  Mercury is due to the difficulty \"of identifying it amongst the  surrounding stars, during the short time that it can be seen\" (Hind's  'Introduction to Astronomy'). There are few stars which are comparable  with Mercury in brilliancy, when seen under the same light.]    [Footnote 13: I may notice another error sometimes made. It is said that  the shadow of a satellite _appears_ elliptical when near the edge of the  disc. The shadow is _in reality_ elliptical when thus situated, but  _appears_ circular. A moment's consideration will show that this should  be so. The part of the disc concealed by a _satellite_ near the limb is  also elliptical, but of course appears round.]    [Footnote 14: From a paper by Mr. Breen, in the 'Popular Science  Review,' October, 1864.]    [Footnote 15: 'Intellectual Observer' for July, 1867, to which magazine  the reader is referred for full details of Mr. Howlett's method of  observation, and for illustrations of the appliances he made use of, and  of some of his results.]    [Footnote 16: As the sun does not attain such an altitude as 18 deg. during  two months in the year, it is well to notice that the true length of the  sun's apparent solar diameter is determinable even immediately after  sun-rise, if the line of graduation is made to coincide with the  _horizontal_ diameter of the picture on the screen--for refraction does  not affect the length of this diameter.]    [Footnote 17: The words \"Left\" and \"Right\" indicate which end of the  sun's ecliptical diameter is uppermost at the dates in upper or lower  row respectively.]          LONDON:    PRINTED BY W.

Alas! each  day brought fresh disappointments. The beautiful feast of  Christmas dawned; still Jesus slept. He left His little ball on  the ground without even glancing that way.    This was indeed a sore trial, but Our Lord, Whose Heart is always  watching, taught me that He granted miracles to those whose faith  is small as a grain of mustard seed, in the hope of strengthening  this slender faith; whilst for His intimate friends, for His  Mother, He did not work miracles till He had proved their faith.  Did He not permit Lazarus to die even though Mary and Martha had  sent word that he was sick? And at the marriage feast of Cana,  when Our Lady asked her Divine Son to aid the master of the house,  did He not answer that His hour had not yet come? But after the  trial what a reward! Water is changed into wine, and Lazarus rises  from the dead. In this way did my Beloved act with His little  Therese; after He had tried her for a long time He granted all her  desires.    For my New Year's gift of 1888, Jesus again gave me His Cross. You  told me, dear Mother, that you had had the Bishop's answer since  December 28, the feast of Holy Innocents; that he authorised my  immediate entry into the Carmel, but that nevertheless you had  decided not to open its doors till after Lent. I could not  restrain my tears at the thought of such a long delay. This trial  affected me in a special manner, for I felt my earthly ties were  severed, and yet the Ark in its turn refused to admit the poor  little dove.    How did these three months pass? They were fruitful in sufferings  and still more so in other graces. At first the thought came into  my mind that I would not put any extra restraint on myself, I  would lead a life somewhat less strictly ordered than was my  custom. But Our Lord made me understand the benefit I might derive  from this time He had granted me, and I then resolved to give  myself up to a more serious and mortified life. When I say  mortified, I do not mean that I imitated the penances of the  Saints; far from resembling those beautiful souls who have  practised all sorts of mortifications from their infancy, I made  mine consist in simply checking my inclinations, keeping back an  impatient answer, doing little services to those around me without  setting store thereby, and a hundred other things of the kind. By  practising these trifles I prepared myself to become the Spouse of  Jesus, and I can never tell you, Mother, how much the added delay  helped me to grow in abandonment, in humility, and in other  virtues.  ______________________________    [1] Joel 2:19.

On the evening before, we were gathered around the  table where I was to take my place for the last time. These  farewells are in themselves heartrending, and just when I would  have liked to be forgotten I received the tenderest expressions of  affection, as if to increase the pain of parting.    The next morning, after a last look at the happy home of my  childhood, I set out for the Carmel, where we all heard Mass. At  the moment of Communion, when Jesus had entered our hearts, I  heard sobs on all sides. I did not shed a tear, but as I led the  way to the cloister door my heart beat so violently that I  wondered if I were going to die. Oh, the agony of that moment! One  must have experienced it in order to understand. I embraced all my  dear ones and knelt for my Father's blessing. He, too, knelt down  and blessed me through his tears. It was a sight to gladden the  Angels, this old man giving his child to God while she was yet in  the springtime of life. At length the doors of the Carmel closed  upon me. . . . I found a welcome in your arms, dear Mother, and  received the embraces of another family, whose devotedness and  love is not dreamt of by the outside world.    At last my desires were realised, and I cannot describe the deep  sweet peace which filled my soul. This peace has remained with me  during the eight and a half years of my life here, and has never  left me even amid the greatest trials.    Everything in the Convent delighted me, especially our little  cell.[1] I fancied myself transported to the desert. I repeat that  my happiness was calm and peaceful--not even the lightest breeze  ruffled the tranquil waters on which my little barque sailed; no  cloud darkened the blue sky. I felt fully recompensed for all I  had gone through, and I kept saying: \"Now I am here for ever.\"  Mine was no passing joy, it did not fade like first illusions.  From illusions God in His Mercy has ever preserved me. I found the  religious life just what I expected, and sacrifice was never a  matter of surprise. Yet you know well that from the beginning my  ways was strewn with thorns rather than with roses.    In the first place, my soul had for its daily food the bread of  spiritual dryness. Then, too, dear Mother, Our Lord allowed you,  unconsciously, to treat me very severely. You found fault with me  whenever you met me. I remember once I had left a cobweb in the  cloister, and you said to me before the whole community: \"It is  easy to see that our cloisters are swept by a child of fifteen. It  is disgraceful! Go and sweep away that cobweb, and be more careful  in future.\"    On the rare occasions when I spent an hour with you for spiritual  direction, you seemed to be scolding me nearly all the time, and  what pained me most of all was that I did not see how to correct  my faults: for instance, my slow ways and want of thoroughness in  my duties, faults which you were careful to point out.    One day it occurred to me that you would certainly prefer me to  spend my free time in work instead of in prayer, as was my custom;  so I plied my needle industriously without even raising my eyes.  No one ever knew of this, as I wished to be faithful to Our Lord  and do things solely for Him to see.    When I was a postulant our Mistress used to send me every  afternoon at half-past four to weed the garden. This was a real  penance, the more so, dear Mother, because I was almost sure to  meet you on the way, and once you remarked: \"Really, this child  does absolutely nothing. What are we to think of a novice who must  have a walk every day?\" And yet, dear Mother, how grateful I am to  you for giving me such a sound and valuable training. It was an  inestimable grace. What should I have become, if, as the world  outside believed, I had been but the pet of the Community?  Perhaps, instead of seeing Our Lord in the person of my superiors,  I should only have considered the creature, and my heart, which  had been so carefully guarded in the world, would have been  ensnared by human affection in the cloister. Happily, your  motherly prudence saved me from such a disaster.    And not only in this matter, but in other and more bitter trials,  I can truly say that Suffering opened her arms to me from the  first, and I took her to my heart. In the solemn examination  before my profession I declared--as was customary--the reason of  my entry into the Carmel: \"I have come to save souls, and  especially to pray for Priests.\" One cannot attain the end without  adopting the means, and as Our Lord made me understand that it was  by the Cross He would give me souls, the more crosses I met with,  the stronger grew my attraction to suffering. For five years this  way was mine, but I alone knew it; this was precisely the flower I  wished to offer to Jesus, a hidden flower which keeps its perfume  only for Heaven.    Two months after my entry Father Pichon was surprised at the  workings of grace in my soul; he thought my piety childlike and my  path an easy one. My conversation with this good Father would have  brought me great comfort, had it not been for the extreme  difficulty I found in opening my heart. Nevertheless I made a  general confession, and after it he said to me: \"Before God, the  Blessed Virgin, and Angels, and all the Saints, I declare that you  have never committed a mortal sin. Thank God for the favours He  has so freely bestowed on you without any merit on your part.\"    Without any merit on my part! That was not difficult to believe.  Fully conscious of my weakness and imperfection, my heart  overflowed with gratitude. I had distressed myself, fearing I  might have stained my baptismal robe, and this assurance, coming  as it did from the lips of a director, a man of wisdom and  holiness, such as our Mother St. Teresa desired, seemed to come  from God Himself. Father Pichon added: \"May Our Lord always be  your Superior and your Novice Master!\" And indeed He ever was, and  likewise my Director. In saying this I do not mean to imply that I  was not communicative with my superiors; far from being reserved,  I always tried to be as an open book.    Our Mistress was a true saint, the perfect type of the first  Carmelites, and I seldom left her side, for she had to teach me  how to work. Her kindness"]]]
