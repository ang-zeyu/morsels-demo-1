The reader who is familiar with the religious observances of India is  probably aware of the extraordinary regard in which the cup is held by  many sects.  In Germany, as Mr Liebich declares, drinking-cups are kept  by the Gipsies with superstitious regard, the utmost care being taken  that they never fall to the ground.  \"Should this happen, the cup is  _never_ used again.  By touching the ground it becomes sacred, and should  no more be used.  When a Gipsy cares for nothing else, he keeps his  drinking-cup under every circumstance.\"  I have not been able to  ascertain whether this species of regard for the cup ever existed in  England, but I know of many who could not be induced to drink from a  white cup or bowl, the reason alleged being the very frivolous and  insufficient one, that it reminded them of a blood-basin.  It is almost  needless to say that this could never have been the origin of the  antipathy.  No such consideration deters English peasants from using  white crockery drinking-vessels.    In Germany, among the Gipsies, if a woman has trodden on any object, or  if the skirt of her dress has swept over or touched it, it is either  destroyed, or if of value, is disposed of or never used again.  I found  on inquiry that the same custom still prevails among the old Gipsy  families in England, and that if the object be a crockery plate or cup,  it is at once broken.  For this reason, even more than for convenience,  real Gipsies are accustomed to hang every cooking utensil, and all that  pertains to the table, high up in their waggons.  It is almost needless  to point out how closely these ideas agree with those of many Hindus.  The  Gipsy eats every and any thing except horseflesh.  Among themselves,  while talking Rommany, they will boast of having eaten _mullo baulors_,  or pigs that have died a natural death, and _hotchewitchi_, or hedgehog,  as did the belle of a Gipsy party to me at Walton-on-Thames in the summer  of 1872.  They can give no reason whatever for this inconsistent  abstinence.  But Mr Simson in his \"History of the Gipsies\" has adduced a  mass of curious facts, indicating a special superstitious regard for the  horse among the Rommany in Scotland, and identifying it with certain  customs in India.  It would be a curious matter of research could we  learn whether the missionaries of the Middle Ages, who made abstinence  from horse-flesh a point of salvation (when preaching in Germany and in  Scandinavia), derived their superstition, in common with the Gipsies,  from India.    There can be no doubt that in seeking for the Indian origin of many Gipsy  words we are often bewildered, and that no field in philology presents  such opportunity for pugnacious critics to either attack or defend the  validity of the proofs alleged.  The very word for \"doubtful\" or  \"ambiguous,\" _dubeni_ or _dub'na_, is of this description.  Is it derived  from the Hindu _dhoobd'ha_, which every Gipsy would pronounce _doobna_,  or from the English _dubious_, which has been made to assume the Gipsy-  Indian termination _na_?  Of this word I was naively told, \"If a juva's  bori (girl is big), that's _dub'ni_; and if she's shuvalo (swelled up),  _that's_ dubni: for it may pen (say) she's kaired a tikno (is  _enceinte_), and it may pen she hasn't.\"  But when we find that the  English Gipsy also employs the word _dukkeni_ for \"doubtful,\" and compare  it with the Hindustani _dhokna_ or _dukna_, the true derivation becomes  apparent.    Had Dr Pott or Dr Paspati had recourse to the plan which I adopted of  reading a copious Hindustani dictionary entirely through, word by word,  to a patient Gipsy, noting down all which he recognised, and his  renderings of them, it is very possible that these learned men would in  Germany and Turkey have collected a mass of overwhelming proof as to the  Indian origin of Rommany.  At present the dictionary which I intend shall  follow this work shows that, so far as the Rommany dialects have been  published, that of England contains a far greater number of almost  unchanged Hindu words than any other, a fact to which I would especially  call the attention of all who are interested in this curious language.  And what is more, I am certain that the supply is far from being  exhausted, and that by patient research among old Gipsies, the  Anglo-Rommany vocabulary might be increased to possibly five or six  thousand words.    It is very possible that when they first came from the East to Europe the  Gipsies had a very copious supply of words, for there were men among them  of superior intelligence.  But in Turkey, as in Germany, they have not  been brought into such close contact with the _Gorgios_ as in England:  they have not preserved their familiarity with so many ideas, and  consequently their vocabulary has diminished.  Most of the Continental  Gipsies are still wild, black wanderers, unfamiliar with many things for  which the English Gipsy has at least a name, and to which he has  continued to apply old Indian words.  Every one familiar with the subject  knows that the English Gipsies in America are far more intelligent than  their German Rommany cousins.  A few years ago a large party of the  latter appeared at an English racecourse, where they excited much  attention, but greatly disgusted the English Roms, not as rivals, but  simply from their habits.  \"They couldn't do a thing but beg,\" said my  informant.  \"They jinned (knew) nothing else: they were the dirtiest  Gipsies I ever saw; and when the juvas suckled the children, they  sikkered their burks (showed their breasts) as I never saw women do  before foki.\"  Such people would not, as a rule, know so many words as  those who looked down on them.    The conclusion which I have drawn from studying Anglo-Rommany, and  different works on India, is that the Gipsies are the descendants of a  vast number of Hindus, of the primitive tribes of Hindustan, who were  expelled or emigrated from that country early in the fourteenth century.  I believe they were chiefly of the primitive tribes, because evidence  which I have given indicates that they were identical with the two castes  of the Doms and Nats--the latter being, in fact, at the present day, the  real Gipsies of India.  Other low castes and outcasts were probably  included in the emigration, but I believe that future research will prove  that they were all of the old stock.  The first Pariahs of India may have  consisted entirely of those who refused to embrace the religion of their  conquerors.    It has been coolly asserted by a recent writer that Gipsies are not  proved to be of Hindu origin because \"a few\" Hindu words are to be found  in their language.  What the proportion of such words really is may be  ascertained from the dictionary which will follow this work.  But  throwing aside all the evidence afforded by language, traditions,  manners, and customs, one irrefutable proof still remains in the physical  resemblance between Gipsies all the world over and the natives of India.  Even in Egypt, the country claimed by the Gipsies themselves as their  remote great-grandfather-land, the native Gipsy is not Egyptian in his  appearance but Hindu.  The peculiar brilliancy of the eye and its  expression in the Indian is common to the Gipsy, but not to the Egyptian  or Arab; and every donkey-boy in Cairo knows the difference between the  _Rhagarin_ and the native as to personal appearance.  I have seen both  Hindus in Cairo and Gipsies, and the resemblance to each other is as  marked as their difference from Egyptians.    A few years ago an article on the Rommany language appeared in the  \"Atlantic Magazine\" (Boston, U.S., America), in which the writer declared  that Gipsy has very little affinity with Hindustani, but a great deal  with Bohemian or Chech--in fact, he maintained, if I remember right, that  a Chech and a Rom could understand one another in either of their  respective tongues.  I once devoted my time for several months to  unintermitted study of Chech, and consequently do not speak in entire  ignorance when I declare that true Rommany contains scores of Hindu words  to one of Bohemian. {133}          CHAPTER IX.

The molasses then gradually  drains from the crystallized portion into the reservoir below,  percolating through the spongy plantain stalks.    On the larger plantations, machinery of very elaborate description is  used, and the most advanced processes known to science are employed in  the manufacture. The principle is, however, the same as has been seen  in the account of the simpler processes. On these larger plantations  there are extensive buildings, quarters for workmen, steam engines,  and all the necessary adjuncts of advanced manufacturing science. In  the sugar mills the cut cane is carried in carts to the mill. It is  then thrown by hand upon an endless flexible conductor which carries  the cane between heavy crushers. The great jaws of the crushers press  the cane into pulp, when it is thrown aside automatically to be carted  away and used as a fertilizer. The juice runs off in the channels of  the conductor into huge pans. The juice is now of a dull gray color  and of a sweet, pleasant taste, and is known as _guarapo_. It must be  clarified at once, for it is of so fermentable a nature that in the  climate of Porto Rico it will run into fermentation inside of half an  hour if the process of clarifying is not commenced. The pans into  which the juice is conducted are pierced like a colander. The liquor  runs through, leaving the refuse matter behind. It is then forced into  tanks by a pump and run to the clarifiers, which are large kettles  heated by steam. Lime is used to assist the clarification. It is then  filtered into vats filled with bone black. The filtering is repeated  until the juice changes color, when it is conveyed to the vacuum pans.  It has now become a thick sirup. It is then pumped into the sirup  clarifiers, skimmed, and again run through bone black, and finally is  conducted into another kettle, where it is allowed to crystallize. The  sirup that fails to crystallize is molasses, and it is here that we  catch up with what we started after. To extract the molasses from the  crystallized mass of sugar, we must go to the purging house. This is  similar to the building spoken of in connection with the simpler  process. It is of two stories. The upper floor is merely a series of  strong frames with apertures for funnel-shaped cylinders. The sugar is  brought into the purging house in great pans, which are placed over  the funnels. The pans are pierced with holes through which the  molasses drains off into troughs which are underneath the floor, all  running to a main trough. From thence the molasses runs into vats,  called _bocoyes_, each of which holds from 1,200 to 1,500 gallons. The  hogsheads in which the molasses is brought to this country are  manufactured principally in Philadelphia and taken to the West Indies.  They are placed in the hold of the vessel and the molasses pumped into  them. The government standard for molasses is 56 degrees polarization.  When not above that test, the duty is four cents per gallon. Above it  the duty is eight cents. This tends to keep molasses pure, as the  addition of glucose increases the quantity of sugar and therefore of  the polarization, and would make necessary the payment of increased  duties. The adulteration of molasses is therefore largely if not  wholly done after it is out of bond and in the hands of the jobber.           *       *       *       *       *          PRIMITIVE IRON MANUFACTURE.      We are indebted for the illustrations and the particulars to Dr.  Percy's invaluable book on iron and steel (probably it is not saying  too much to describe it as the best work on the subject ever written).    [Illustration: SECTION OF INDIAN BLAST FURNACE AND BLOWING MACHINE.]    Fig. 1 shows a sectional elevation, and Fig. 2 shows a plan of furnace  and bellows and tuyeres, indeed, an entire ironworks plant used in  India, not only now, but, so far as we can gather, from time  immemorial. The two figures give a sufficiently clear idea of the form  of furnace used in Lower Bengal, in which portion of our Indian empire  there are entire villages exclusively inhabited by iron smelters, who,  sad to relate, are distinguished from the agricultural villages  surrounding them by their filth, poverty, and generally degraded  condition. There are whole tribes in India who have no other  occupation than iron smelting. They, of course, sink no shafts and  open no mines, and are not permanent in any place. They simply remain  in one place so long as plentiful supplies of ore and wood are  obtainable in the immediate vicinity. In many cases the villages  formerly inhabited by them have passed out of existence, but the  waste, or rather wasted products, of their operations remain.    The furnace shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is built of the sandy soil of the  district, moistened and kneaded and generally strengthened by a sort  of skeleton of strips of flexible wood. In form it varies from a  cylinder, more or less circular, diverging into a tolerably acute  cone, the walls being about 3 in. thick. The height is generally  about 3 ft. and the mean internal diameter about 1 ft., but all these  dimensions vary with different workmen and in different localities.  There are two apertures at the base of the furnace; one in front,  about 1 ft. in height, and rather less in width than the internal  diameter of the furnace, through which, when the smelting of one  charge is finished, the resulting mass of spongy iron is extracted,  and which during the smelting is well plastered up, the small conical  tuyere being inserted at the bottom. This tuyere is usually made of  the same material as the furnace--namely, of a sandy soil; worked by  hand into the required form and sun-dried; but sometimes no other  tuyere is employed than a lump of moist clay with a hole in it, into  which the bamboo pipes communicating with the bellows are inserted.  The other aperture is smaller, and placed at one side of the furnace,  and chiefly below the ground, forming a communication between the  bottom of the furnace chamber and a small trench into which the slag  flows and filters out through a small pile of charcoal. It is this  slag being found in places where iron is not now made that shows that  iron smelting was an occupation there, perhaps many centuries before.    The inclined tray shown at the top of the furnace on Fig. 1 is made of  the same material as the furnace itself, and when kneaded into shape  is supported on a wooden framework. On it is piled a supply of  charcoal, which is raked into the furnace when required.    The blowing apparatus is singularly ingenious, and is certainly as  economical of manual labor as a blowing arrangement depending on  manual labor well can be. A section of the bellows forms the portion  to the right of Fig. 1, showing tuyere forming the connection between  bellows and furnace. It consists of a circular segment of hard wood,  rudely hollowed, and having a piece of buffalo hide with a small hole  in its center tied over the top. Into this hole a strong cord is  passed, with a small piece of wood attached to the end to keep it  inside the bellows, while the other end is attached to a bent bamboo  firmly fixed into the ground close by. This bamboo acts as a spring,  drawing up the string, and consequently the leather cover of the  bellows, to its utmost stretch, while air enters through the central  hole. When thus filled, a man places his foot on the hide, closing the  central hole with his heel, and then throwing the whole weight of his  body on to that foot, he depresses the hide, and drives the air out  through a bamboo tube inserted in the side and communicating with the  furnace. At the same time he pulls down the bamboo with the arm of  that side. Two such bellows are placed side by side, a thin bamboo  tube attached to each, and both entering the one tuyere; and so by  jumping on each bellows alternately, the workman keeps up a continuous  blast.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--PLAN OF INDIAN BLAST FURNACE AND BLOWING  MACHINE.]    The Figs. 1 and 2 are taken from sketches, and the description from  particulars, by Mr. Blandford, who was for some years on the  Geological Survey of India, and had exceptional opportunities in his  journeyings of observing the customs and occupations of the Indian  iron smelters. The blowing machine is an especially wonderful and  effective machine, and was first described and illustrated by Mr.  Robert Rose, in a Calcutta publication, more than half a century ago.  He also had seen it used in iron making in India.--_Colliery  Guardian._           *       *       *       *       *          WOOD OIL.      Wood oil is now made on a large scale in Sweden from the refuse of  timber cuttings and forest clearings, and from stumps and roots.  Although it cannot well be burned in common lamps, on account of the  heavy proportion of carbon it contains, it is said to furnish a  satisfactory light in lamps specially made for it; and in its natural  state it is the cheapest illuminating oil. There are some thirty  factories engaged in its production, and they turn out about 40,000  liters of the oil daily. Turpentine, creosote, acetic acid, charcoal,  coal-tar oils, etc., are also obtained from the same materials as the  wood oil.           *       *       *       *       *          SOAP.    By HENRY LEFFMANN, M.D.      Although the use of soap dates from a rather remote period, the  chemist is still living, at an advanced age, to whom we are indebted  for a knowledge of its composition and mode of formation. Considerably  more than a generation has elapsed since Chevreul announced these  facts, but a full appreciation of the principles involved is scarcely  realized outside of the circle of professional chemists. Learned  medical and physiological writers often speak of glycerin as the  \"sweet principle of fats,\" or term fats compounds of fatty acids and  "]]]
