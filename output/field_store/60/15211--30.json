Yet there is  in him some lively prescription of that innocent and indivisible  virtue that Nature omitted from men and gave only to Dogs. This is  something that has been the cause of much vile verse in bad poets,  of such gruesome twaddle as Senator Vest's dreadful outbark. But it  is a true thing.    How absurd, we will interject, is the saying: \"Love me, love my  dog.\" If he really is my dog, he won't let you love him. Again, one  man's dog is another man's mongrel. Mr. Robert Cortes Holliday, that  quaint philosopher frequently doggishly nicknamed Owd Bob, went to  Washington lately to see President Harding. His eye fell upon the  White House Airedale. Now Owd Bob is himself something of an  Airedale trifler, and cherishes the memory of a certain Tristram  Shandy, an animal that frequently appeared in the lighter editorials  of the _Bookman_ when Mr. Holliday (then the editor) could think of  nothing else to write about. And of Mr. Harding's dog Mr. Holliday  reports, with grave sorrow: \"I don't think he is a good Airedale. He  has too much black on him. Now Shandy had only a small saddle of  black....\"    But such are matters concerning only students of full-bred dogs, of  whom we are not who.    As to Gissing: we were trying to think, while writing the preceding  excursion, how to give you his colour. Yellow is a word too violent,  too vulgarly connotative. Brown is a muddy word. Sandy is too pale.  Gamboge is a word used by artists, who are often immoral and  excitable. Shall we say, the colour of a corncob pipe, singed and  tawnied by much smoking? Or a pigskin tobacco pouch while it is  still rather new? Or the colour of the _Atlantic Monthly_ in the old  days, when it lay longer on the stands than it does now, and got  faintly bleached? And in this colour, whatever it is, you must  discern a dimly ruddy tinge. On his forehead, which is not really a  forehead, but a continuation of a long and very vulpine nose, there  is a small white stripe. It runs upward from between his eyes, but  cants slightly to one side (like a great many journalists). There  is a small white patch on his chin. There is a white waistcoat on  his chest, or bosom if you consider that a more affectionate word.  White also are the last twelve bristles (we have counted them) on  his tail (which is much too long). His front ankles bend inward  rather lopsidedly, as though he had fallen downstairs when very  young. When we stoke the furnace, he extends his forward legs on the  floor (standing erect the while in his rearward edifice) and lays  his head sideways on his paws, and considers us in a manner not  devoid of humour.    Not far from our house, in that desirable but not very residential  region which we have erst described as the Forest of Arden, there is  a pond. It is a very romantic spot, it is not unlike the pond by  which a man smoking a Trichinopoly cigar was murdered in one of the  Sherlock Holmes stories. (The Boscombe Valley Mystery!) It is a  shallow little pond, but the water is very clear; last winter when  it was frozen it always reminded us of the cheerful advertising of  one of the ice companies, it was so delightfully transparent. This  pond is a kind of Union League Club for the frogs at this time of  year; all night long you can hear them reclining in their armchairs  of congenial mud and uttering their opinions, which vary very little  from generation to generation. Most of those frogs are Republicans,  we feel sure, but we love them no less.    In this pond Gissing had his first swim one warm Sunday recently.  The party set out soon after breakfast. Gissing was in the van, his  topaz eyes wild with ambition. Followed a little red express-wagon,  in which sat the Urchiness, wearing her best furry hat which has,  in front, a small imitation mouse-head with glass eyes. The Urchin,  wearing a small Scotch bonnet with ribbons, assisted in hauling the  wagon. Gissing had not yet been tested in the matter of swimming:  this was a sober moment. Would he take gladly to the ocean? (So the  Urchin innocently calls our small sheet of water, having by a  harmless ratiocination concluded that this term applies to any body  of water not surrounded by domestic porcelain.)    Now Gissing is passionate in the matter of chasing sticks hurled  abroad. On seeing a billet seized and held aloft with that sibilant  sound which stirs his ingenuous spirit to prodigies of pursuit, his  eyes were flame, his heart was apoplexy. The stick flew aloft and  curved into the pond, and he rushed to the water's edge. But there,  like the recreant knight in the Arthurian idyl, he paused and  doubted. There was Excalibur, floating ten feet from shore. This was  a new experience. Was it written that sticks should be pursued in  this strange and alien element? He barked querulously, and returned,  his intellect clouded with hesitation. What was this etiquette? He  was embarrassed.    Another stick was flung into the trembling mere. This time there was  no question. When the gods give the same sign twice, the only answer  is obey. A tawny streak crossed the small meadow, and leaped  unquestioningly into the pond. There was a plunging and a spattery  scuffle, and borne up by a million years of heredity he pursued the  floating enemy. It was seized, and a large gulp of water also, but  backward he came bearing it merrily. Then, also unknowing that he  was fulfilling old tradition, he came as near as possible to the  little group of presbyters and dehydrated himself upon them. Thus  was a new experience added to this young creature. The frogs grew  more and more pensive as he spent the rest of the morning churning  the pond hither and thither.    That will be all about Gissing for the present.            [Illustration]        A DIALOGUE      It was our good fortune to overhear a dialogue between Gissing (our  dog) and Mike, the dog who lives next door. Mike, or Crowgill Mike  II, to give him his full entitles, is a very sagacious old person,  in the fifteenth year of his disillusionment, and of excellent  family. If our humble Gissing is to have a three-barrelled name, it  can only be Haphazard Gissing I, for his ancestry is plainly  miscellaneous and impromptu. He is, we like to say, a synthetic dog.  He is young: six months; we fear that some of the errors now  frequently urged against the rising generation are plainly  discernible in him. And Mike, who is grizzled and grown somewhat  dour, shows toward our Gissing much the attitude of Dr. Eliot toward  the younger litter of humans.    In public, and when any one is watching, Mike, who is the Dog  Emeritus of the Salamis Estates, pays no heed to Gissing at all:  ignores him, and prowls austerely about his elderly business. But  secretly spying from a window, we have seen him, unaware of notice,  stroll (a little heavily and stiffly, for an old dog's legs grow  gouty) over to Gissing's kennel. With his tail slightly vibrant, he  conducts a dignified causerie. Unhappily, these talks are always  concluded by some breach of manners on Gissing's part. At first he  is respectful; but presently his enthusiasm grows too much for him;  he begins to leap and frolic and utter uncouth praises of things in  general. Then Mike turns soberly and moves away.    On such an occasion, the chat went like this:    GISSING: Do you believe in God?    MIKE: I acknowledge Him. I don't believe in Him.    GISSING: Oh, I think He's splendid. Hurrah! Hullabaloo! When He puts  on those old khaki trousers and smokes that curve-stem pipe I always  know there's a good time coming.    MIKE: You have made a mistake. That is not God. God is a tall,  placid, slender man, who wears puttees when He works in the garden  and smokes only cigarettes.    GISSING: Not at all. God is quite stout, and of uncertain temper,  but I adore Him.    MIKE: No one knows God at your age. There is but one God, and I have  described Him. There is no doubt about it, because He sometimes  stays away from the office on Saturdays. Only God can do that.    GISSING: What a glorious day this is. What ho! Halleluiah! I don't  suppose you know what fun it is to run round in circles. How  ignorant of life the older generation is.    MIKE: Humph.    GISSING: Do you believe in Right and Wrong? I mean, are they  absolute, or only relative?    MIKE: When I was in my prime Right was Right, and Wrong was Wrong. A  bone, buried on someone else's ground, was sacred. I would not have  dreamed of digging it up----    GISSING (_hastily_): But I am genuinely puzzled. Suppose a motor  truck goes down the road. My instinct tells me that I ought to chase  it and bark loudly. But if God is around He calls me back and  rebukes me, sometimes painfully. Yet I am convinced that there is  nothing essentially wrong in my action.    MIKE: The question of morals is not involved. If you were not so  young and foolish you would know that your God (if you so call Him,  though He is not a patch on mine) knows what is good for you better  than you do yourself. He forbids your chasing cars because you might  get hurt.    GISSING: Then instinct is not to be obeyed?    MIKE: Not when God is around.    GISSING: Yet He encourages me to chase sticks, which my instinct  strongly impels me to do. Prosit! Waes hael! Excuse my enthusiasm,  but you really know very little of the world or you would not take  things so calmly.    MIKE: My dear boy, rheumatism is a great sedative. You will learn by  and by. What are you making such a racket about?    GISSING: I have just learned that there is no such thing as free  will. I don't suppose you ever meditated on these things, you are  such an old stick-in-the-mud. But in my generation we scrutinize  everything.    MIKE: There is plenty of free will when you have learned to will the  right things. But there's no use willing yourself to destroy a motor  truck, because it can't be done.

Then began a tug of war in dead earnest, with the rope  nearly three feet in the Rockleys' favor.          CHAPTER XXII    A SWIM AND SOME SNAKES      The majority of the cadets were now inclined to think that Rockley's  team would win the contest. They had seen Tom's followers sneezing,  but thought this might come from the dampness of the ground.    \"Don't give in, Tom!\" cried Sam, dancing around. \"You've got to beat  him!\"    \"Bah! you act like a monkey,\" said Lew Flapp. \"Rockley's fellows are  bound to win.\"    In the meantime the rope was moving rapidly backward and forward. Once  Rockley and his men had Tom's team dangerously close to the line. But  Tom ordered a drop and there the team clung, refusing to budge an inch  further.    \"Time is almost up,\" said George Strong. \"Three minutes more!\"    \"Up!\" cried Rockley.    \"Up and pull for all you are worth!\" cried Tom. \"Pull, I tell you! Make  every ounce of muscle count!\"    And pull Tom's team did as never before, and Tom with them, watching  for the first sign of returning weakness. But the team was now on its  mettle and made the Rockleys come over the line in spite of the frantic  orders from Rockley himself to drop.    \"It's ours!\" screamed Tom, and with a final haul brought the opponents  over the line with a rush. Rockley, flat on his back on the grass,  trying in vain to dig his heels into the soil, and the others  floundering just as vainly.    A cheer went up for Tom's team, while Rockley and his followers left  the field in disgust.    \"It was well won, Tom!\" said Dick enthusiastically. \"I never saw a  better tug of war in my life.\"    \"I'd like to know who threw that pepper,\" answered Tom, with an angry  glance toward Lew Flapp and his cronies.    \"Did somebody throw pepper?\" asked Mr. Strong.    \"I think they did, although I'm not sure. Anyway, something came along  and made the most of us sneeze.\"    \"It's too bad, Rover. I'll try to make sure of this,\" said the teacher.  But though he made an investigation nothing came of it.    Some of the cadets were so delighted with the success of Tom's team  that they took Tom on their shoulders and marched around the entire  encampment with him.    \"I tell you, Rockley feels sore,\" said Sam, a little later.    \"Around the belt?\" asked Tom with a grin.    \"I mean in his mind. He and Lew Flapp are having a regular quarrel over  the contest. I guess Flapp lost some money.\"    \"Perhaps, if he has, it will cure him of betting,\" put in Dick.    Sam and Tom had received permission to go to the upper end of the lake  in one of the rowboats on the following afternoon. Songbird Powell and  Fred Garrison went along, and all took their fishing outfits and plenty  of bait.    \"Bring home a nice mess of fish,\" said Dick, on parting with his  brothers. \"Sorry I can't go with you.\"    \"Oh, you'll have company enough,\" declared Sam. \"I heard that some of  the country folks are going to visit the encampment to-day and perhaps  those Staton girls will be among them.\"    The four boys were soon on the way, two rowing at a time. The weather  was ideal, and the water as smooth as that of a mill pond.    \"What a beautiful spot this is,\" declared Fred, as they glided long.  \"I'm sure Captain Putnam could not have selected a better.\"    \"I have already gotten some splendid pictures,\" returned Powell, who  possessed a good snap-shot camera, now lying on the stern seat of the  boat. \"I'm going to take some more pictures to-day.\"    On the way to the upper end of the lake Sam did a little fishing and  brought in one bass of fair size.    \"This makes a fellow feel like a true poet,\" murmured Powell, gazing  dreamily at the water, and then he went on:      \"I love to glide,     By the green-clad side     Of the glassy lake,     And there to take     My ease with book     Or line and hook,     And spend the day     Far, far away     From care and toil,     On Nature's soil.\"    \"Just to listen to Songbird!\" cried Tom. \"He grinds it out like a  regular sausage-making machine,\" and then he went on gayly:      \"I love to swim,     In Nature's soil,     By the green-clad side,     Of a mountain wide,     And there to bake,     My little toes,     On a garden rose,     And take a hose,     And wet the lake     With a hot snowflake,     In the middle of June--     If that isn't too soon--     And sail to the moon     In a big balloon--\"    \"Oh, Tom, let up!\" roared Fred. \"Talk about a sausage-making machine--\"      \"And when in the moon,     I'd drive a stake,     And tie my lake     Fast to a star,     Or a trolley car,     Then jump in a sack     And ride right back--\"      \"To where you belong,     And stop that song!\"    finished Sam. \"Oh, but that's the worst yet. Shall we duck him, Fred?\"    \"No, don't pollute the water,\" answered Garrison.    \"He ought to be ducked,\" came from Powell, in disgust. \"Whenever I have  a poetic streak--\"    \"It's catching, as the fly-paper said to the fly,\" finished Tom. \"Let's  call it square and take a new tack. Who's in for a swim when we reach  the end of the lake?\"    \"I am!\" was the united cry from the others. They were passing several  small islands and now came to another turn in Bass Lake. Just beyond  this was a small sandy beach, backed up by a mass of rocks and  brushwood.    \"That looks like a good place for a swim,\" said Powell, forgetting all  about his so-called poetry.    \"Suits me,\" returned Tom. \"Let's pull ashore and tie the boat fast, and  I'll put up--\"    \"A peanut reward for the first fellow in,\" finished Fred. \"Caught you  that time, Tom, just as you caught Songbird with his doggerel.\"    As happy as any boys could be, the four cadets tied up their boat. In  doing this one started to splash in the water, followed by another, and  as a consequence before the cutting-up came to a finish the seats of  the craft were pretty well wetted.    \"Never mind,\" said Tom. \"They'll soon dry in the sun. We can put our  clothes on the rocks.\"    The boys were soon in the water and having a most glorious time. The  lake was fairly deep off the end of the boat and here they took turns  at diving. Fred and Songbird also went in for a race, the former coming  in only a few feet ahead.    \"I guess we had better dress now and try our hand at fishing,\" said Sam  after nearly an hour had passed.    \"One more dive!\" cried Tom and took one full of grace, to the very  bottom of the lake.    As Tom came up to the surface he heard a cry from Sam, quickly followed  by a yell from Fred.    \"What's up?\" he called out, swimming toward the shore.    \"Land on the boat, Tom!\" cried Sam, and leaped into the craft, followed  by Fred and Powell.    \"All right; but what is wrong?\" asked Tom, and climbed tip over the  stern.    \"We can't get our clothes.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Look for yourself.\"    Tom looked and gave a low whistle of astonishment. And not without good  reason, for there on the rocks where they had left their garments  rested a big black snake!    \"This is interesting truly,\" murmured the boy, gazing at his companions  in dismay.    \"I'm going to get a rock and throw it at the snake,\" said Sam.    A stone was close to the boat, and watching his chance, he picked it up  and threw it at the reptile.    The snake darted to one side. It was merely grazed by the rock and now  it hissed viciously.    The hiss appeared to be a signal, and in a moment more another snake  and then another appeared, until fully a dozen reptiles each a yard or  more in length covered the rocks where all of the cadets' wearing  apparel rested!          CHAPTER XXIII    A GLIMPSE OF AN OLD ENEMY      \"We are in a pickle now and no mistake!\" groaned Fred Garrison. He  hated snakes as much as he did poison.    \"It's certainly bad,\" declared Songbird Powell. \"I wonder what we had  best do?\"    \"Has anybody got a pistol?\"    Nobody had, nor was there any weapon handy outside of a jackknife and a  fishing rod.    \"If we only had a shot-gun,\" sighed Sam.    \"But we haven't one and we must do the best we can without it,\"  answered Tom. \"Songbird, supposing you try to charm 'em with some of  that soothing poetry of yours. Or take a picture of 'em.\"    \"This is no joke,\" growled Powell. \"I want my clothes.\"    \"Well, go ahead and take 'em--I shan't stop you.\"    \"I'm going to get another rock,\" said Sam.    \"Let us all get stones,\" suggested Tom. \"Then we can throw together.\"    This was thought to be a good idea, and soon the stones were secured  and each cadet took careful aim.    Three of the snakes were hit, one quite seriously. These retreated, but  the other snakes remained as defiant as ever.    \"There must be a nest under the rocks,\" said Tom. \"Were that not so I  am sure the snakes would leave at once.\"    \"I've got another idea!\" cried Fred. \"Why didn't we think of it  before?\"    \"I haven't thought of it yet, Fred,\" grinned Tom. \"What is it?\"    \"Let us take our fishing rods and tie one fast to another. Then we can  turn the boat around and go fishing on the rocks for our clothes.\"    \"That's the talk,\" rejoined Powell. \"A good idea, Fred.\"    Three of the rods were pieced together, making a fishing pole over  thirty feet long. The boat was then swung around, and while two kept  the craft in place the others went fishing for the clothing.    The task was not so easy as it looked, and the snakes whipped around  and hissed in a most alarming fashion. More than once they had a coat  or other garment on the pole only to drop it again. But they persevered  and soon had everything on board but Fred's shirt and one of Tom's  shoes.    \"Her"]]]
