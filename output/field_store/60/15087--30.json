I gradually removed everything from the room that he could  possibly eat, but still the old proverb of \"Once caught, twice shy,\"  so far applied that he would not enter my trap. After many days,  visiting the apartment one morning, the trap was down, the mouse was  caught; the pangs of hunger were more intolerable than the terrors of  imprisonment. He did not, however, will the unpleasant alternative of  entering the trap until he was so nearly starved that his bones almost  protruded through his skin; and he freely took bits of food from my  fingers through the wires of the cage.\"--_Instinct and Reason_, just  published."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#20)"],[1,"compared  to Buda-Pescht, as the Hungarian calls it. You see I am not only a  lover, but also an enthusiast, for nature. Now I shall soothe my  excited blood with a cup of tea, after Hildebrand has actually put in  an appearance, and shall then go to bed and dream of you, my love.  Last night I had only four hours of sleep, and the court here is  terribly matutinal; the young gentleman himself rises as early as five  o 'clock, so that I should be a bad courtier if I were to sleep much  longer. Therefore I bid you good-night from afar, with a side-glance  at a gigantic teapot and an enticing plate of cold jellied cuts,  tongue, as I see, among the rest. Where did I get that song that  occurs to me continually today--\"_Over the blue mountain, over the  white sea-foam, come, thou beloved one, come to thy lonely home_\"? I  don't know who must have sung that to me, some time in _auld lang  syne_. May God's angels keep you today as hitherto.    Your most faithful v.B.      The 24th.    After having slept very well, although on a wedge-shaped pillow, I bid  you good-morning, my heart. The whole panorama before me is bathed in  such a bright, burning sun that I cannot look out at all without being  blinded. Until I begin my calls I am sitting here breakfasting and  smoking all alone in a very spacious apartment--four rooms, all  thickly vaulted, two something like our dining-room in size, thick  walls as at Schoenhausen, gigantic nut-wood closets, blue silk  furnishings, a profusion of large spots on the floor, an ell in size,  which a more excited fancy than mine might take for blood, but which I  decidedly declare to be ink; an unconscionably awkward scribe must  have lodged here, or another Luther repeatedly hurled big inkstands  at his opponents. * * * Exceedingly strange figures, brown, with broad  hats and wide trousers, are floating about on long wooden rafts in the  Danube below. I regret I am not an artist; I should like to let you  see these wild faces, mustached, long-haired with excited black eyes,  and the ragged, picturesque drapery which hangs about them, as they  appeared to me all day yesterday. * * * Farewell, my heart. God bless  you and our present and future children.    Your most faithful v.B.      Evening.    I have not yet found an opportunity to send this. Again the lights are  shining up from Pesth, lightning appears on the horizon in the  direction of the Theiss, and there is starlight above us. I have been  in uniform most of the day, handed my credentials to the young ruler  of this country at a solemn audience, and received a very pleasing  impression of him--twenty-year-old vivacity, coupled with studied  composure. He _can_ be very winning, I have seen that; whether he  always will, I do not know, and he need not, for that matter. At any  rate, he is for this country exactly what it needs, and more than that  for the peace of its neighbors, if God does not give him a  peace-loving heart. After dinner all the court went on an excursion  into the mountains, to a romantic spot called the Pretty Shepherdess,  who has long been dead, King Matthias Corvinus having loved her many  hundred years ago. Thence the view is over woody hills, like those on  the Neckar banks to Ofen, its castle, and the plain. A popular  festival had brought thousands up to it, and the Emperor, who mingled  with them, was surrounded with noisy cheers; Czardas danced, waltzed,  sang, played, climbed into the trees, and crowded the court-yard. On a  grassy slope was a supper-table of about twenty persons, sitting along  one side only, leaving the other free for a view of wood, hill, city,  and country, high beeches over us, with Hungarians climbing among the  branches; behind us a densely crowded and crowding mass of people near  by, and, beyond, alternate horn-music and singing, wild gipsy  melodies. Illumination, moonlight, and evening glow, interspersed with  torches through the wood; the whole might have been served, unaltered,  as a great scenic effect in a romantic opera. Beside me sat the  whitebearded Archbishop of Gran, primate of Hungary, in a black silk  talar, with a red cape; on the other side a very amiable and elegant  general of cavalry, Prince Liechtenstein. You see, the painting was  rich in contrasts. Then we rode home by moonlight, escorted by  torches; and while I smoke my evening cigar I am writing to my  darling, and leaving the documents until tomorrow. * * * I have  listened today to the story of how this castle was stormed by the  insurgents three years ago, when the brave General Hentzi and the  entire garrison were cut down after a wonderfully heroic defence. The  black spots on my floor are in part burns, and where I am now writing  to you the shells then danced about, and the combat finally raged on  top of smoking _debris_. It was only put in order again a few weeks  ago, against the Emperor's arrival. Now it is very quiet and cozy up  here; I hear only the ticking of a clock and distant rolling of wheels  from below. For the second time from this place I bid you good-night  in the distance. May angels watch over you--a grenadier with a  bear-skin cap does that for me here; I see his bayonet two arm-lengths  away from me, projecting six inches above the windowsill, and  reflecting my light. He is standing on the terrace over the Danube,  and is, perhaps, thinking of his Nan, too.      Tomsjoenaes, August 16, '57.    _My Dearest,_--I make use again of the Sunday quiet to give you a sign  of life, though I do not know what day there will be a chance to send  it out of this wilderness to the mail. I rode about seventy miles  without break, through the desolate forest, in order to reach here,  and before me lie more than a hundred miles more before one gets to  provinces of arable land. Not a city, not a village, far and wide;  only single settlers in wide huts, with a little barley and potatoes,  who find rods of land to till, here and there between dead trees,  pieces of rock, and bushes. Picture to yourself about five hundred  square miles of such desolate country as that around Viartlum, high  heather, alternating with short grass and bog, and with birches,  junipers pines, beeches, oaks, alders, here impenetrably thick, there  thin and barren of foliage, the whole strewn with innumerable stones  of all sizes up to that of a house, smelling of wild rosemary and  rosin, at intervals wonderfully shaped lakes surrounded by woods and  hills of the heath, then you have the land of Smaa, where I am just  now. Really, the land of my dreams, inaccessible to despatches,  colleagues, and Reitzenstein, but unfortunately, to you as well. I  should like ever so much to have a hunting-castle on one of these  quiet lakes and inhabit it for some months with all the dear ones whom  I think of now as assembled in Reinfeld. In winter, to be sure, it  would not be endurable here, especially in the mud that all the rain  would make. Yesterday we turned out at about five, hunted, in burning  heat, up-hill and down, through bush and fen, until eleven, and found  absolutely nothing; walking in bogs and impenetrable juniper thickets,  on large stones and timbers, is very fatiguing. Then we slept in a  hay-shed until two o'clock, drank lots of milk, and hunted again until  sunset, bringing down twenty-five grouse and two mountain-hens. I shot  four of the former; Engel, to his great delight, one of the latter.  Then we dined in the hunting-lodge, a remarkable wooden building on a  peninsula in the lake. My sleeping-room and its three chairs, two  tables, and bedstead are of no other color than that of the natural  pine-boards, like the whole house, whose walls are made of these. A  sofa does not exist; bed very hard; but after such hardships as ours  one does not need to be rocked to sleep. From my window I see a  blooming hill rise from the heath, on it birches rocking in the wind,  and between them I see, in the lake mirror, pine-woods on the other  side. Near the house a camp has been put up for hunters, drivers,  servants, and peasants, then the barricade of wagons, a little city of  dogs, eighteen or twenty huts on both sides of a lane which they form;  from each a throng looks out tired from yesterday's hunt. * * *      Petersburg, April 4, '59.    _My Dear Heart_,--Now that the rush of today noon is past, I sit down  in the evening to write you a few more lines in peace. When I closed  my letter today I did it with the intention of writing to you next a  birthday letter, and thought I had plenty of time for it; it is only  the 23d of March here. I have thought it over, and find that a letter  must go out today exactly to reach Frankfort on the 11th; it is hard  to get used to the seven days' interval which the post needs. So I  hurry my congratulations. May God grant you His rich blessing in soul  and body, for all your love and truth, and give you resignation and  contentment in regard to the various new conditions of life, contrary  to your inclinations, which you will meet here. We cannot get rid of  the sixtieth degree of latitude, and we have not chosen our own lot.  Many live happily here, although the ice is still solid as rock, and  more snow fell in the night, and there are no garden and no Taunus  here.    I could get along very well indeed here if I only knew the same of  you, and, above all, if I had you with me. All official matters--and  in them rests really the calling which in this world has fallen to my  lot, and which you, through your significant \"Yes\" in the Kolziglow  church, are bound to help bear in joy and sorrow--all official matters  are, in comparison with Frankfort, changed from thorns to roses;  whether they will ever blossom is, indeed, uncertain. The aggravations  of the Diet and the palace venom look from here like childishness. If  we do not wantonly make ourselves disagreeable, we are welcome here.  Whenever the carriages are called here, and \"_Prusku passlanika\"_  (\"P"]]]
