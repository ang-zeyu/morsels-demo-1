His black, malignant face will     shut out all memory of sunshine and happiness.  I shall eternally see     his evil eyes as he threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort     to escape from the consequences of his own misdoing.  The more I think     of it, the more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the     whole thing--of course, except his own horrible death.       \"Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear.  It is one     of my most valued treasures--an ermine collar studded with emeralds.  I     had often seen the nigger's eyes gleam covetously when he looked at     it.  Unhappily, I wore it yesterday.  That may have been the cause     that lured the poor man to his doom.  On the very brink of the abyss     he tore the collar from my neck--that was the last I saw of him.  When     he sank into the hole, I was rushing to the iron door, which I pulled     behind me.  When I heard that soul-sickening yell, which marked his     disappearance in the chasm, I was more glad than I can say that my     eyes were spared the pain and horror which my ears had to endure.       \"When I tore myself out of the negro's grasp as he sank into the well-     hole; I realised what freedom meant.  Freedom!  Freedom!  Not only     from that noisome prison-house, which has now such a memory, but from     the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster.  Whilst I live, I     shall always thank you for my freedom.  A woman must sometimes express     her gratitude; otherwise it becomes too great to bear.  I am not a     sentimental girl, who merely likes to thank a man; I am a woman who     knows all, of bad as well as good, that life can give.  I have known     what it is to love and to lose.  But you must not let me bring any     unhappiness into your life.  I must live on--as I have lived--alone,     and, in addition, bear with other woes the memory of this latest     insult and horror.  In the meantime, I must get away as quickly as     possible from Diana's Grove.  In the morning I shall go up to town,     where I shall remain for a week--I cannot stay longer, as business     affairs demand my presence here.  I think, however, that a week in the     rush of busy London, surrounded with multitudes of commonplace people,     will help to soften--I cannot expect total obliteration--the terrible     images of the bygone night.  When I can sleep easily--which will be, I     hope, after a day or two--I shall be fit to return home and take up     again the burden which will, I suppose, always be with me.       \"I shall be most happy to see you on my return--or earlier, if my good     fortune sends you on any errand to London.  I shall stay at the     Mayfair Hotel.  In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers     and horrors we have shared together.  Adieu, and thank you, again and     again, for all your kindness and consideration to me.       \"ARABELLA MARSH.\"    Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle, but he determined to say  nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it well over.  When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast, he was glad that he had taken  time to turn things over in his mind.  The result had been that not only  was he familiar with the facts in all their bearings, but he had already  so far differentiated them that he was able to arrange them in his own  mind according to their values.  Breakfast had been a silent function, so  it did not interfere in any way with the process of thought.    So soon as the door was closed, Sir Nathaniel began:    \"I see, Adam, that something has occurred, and that you have much to tell  me.\"    \"That is so, sir.  I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I  know--all that has happened since I left you yesterday?\"    Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during the  previous evening.  He confined himself rigidly to the narration of  circumstances, taking care not to colour events by any comment of his  own, or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not fully  understand.  At first, Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask questions,  but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the narration was  concise and self-explanatory.  Thenceforth, he contented himself with  quick looks and glances, easily interpreted, or by some acquiescent  motions of his hands, when such could be convenient, to emphasise his  idea of the correctness of any inference.  Until Adam ceased speaking,  having evidently come to an end of what he had to say with regard to this  section of his story, the elder man made no comment whatever.  Even when  Adam took from his pocket Lady Arabella's letter, with the manifest  intention of reading it, he did not make any comment.  Finally, when Adam  folded up the letter and put it, in its envelope, back in his pocket, as  an intimation that he had now quite finished, the old diplomatist  carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book.    \"Your narrative, my dear Adam, is altogether admirable.  I think I may  now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts, and that  our conference had better take the shape of a mutual exchange of ideas.  Let us both ask questions as they may arise; and I do not doubt that we  shall arrive at some enlightening conclusions.\"    \"Will you kindly begin, sir?  I do not doubt that, with your longer  experience, you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which envelops  certain of the things which we have to consider.\"    \"I hope so, my dear boy.  For a beginning, then, let me say that Lady  Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--and also  some things which she did not intend.  But, before I begin to draw  deductions, let me ask you a few questions.  Adam, are you heart-whole,  quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?\"    His companion answered at once, each looking the other straight in the  eyes during question and answer.    \"Lady Arabella, sir, is a charming woman, and I should have deemed it a  privilege to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the  confessional--to flirt a little with her.  But if you mean to ask if my  affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer 'No!'--as  indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason.  Apart  from that, there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day.\"    \"Could you--would you mind giving me the reason now?  It will help us to  understand what is before us, in the way of difficulty.\"    \"Certainly, sir.  My reason, on which I can fully depend, is that I love  another woman!\"    \"That clinches it.  May I offer my good wishes, and, I hope, my  congratulations?\"    \"I am proud of your good wishes, sir, and I thank you for them.  But it  is too soon for congratulations--the lady does not even know my hopes  yet.  Indeed, I hardly knew them myself, as definite, till this moment.\"    \"I take it then, Adam, that at the right time I may be allowed to know  who the lady is?\"    Adam laughed a low, sweet laugh, such as ripples from a happy heart.    \"There need not be an hour's, a minute's delay.  I shall be glad to share  my secret with you, sir.  The lady, sir, whom I am so happy as to love,  and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred, is Mimi  Watford!\"    \"Then, my dear Adam, I need not wait to offer congratulations.  She is  indeed a very charming young lady.  I do not think I ever saw a girl who  united in such perfection the qualities of strength of character and  sweetness of disposition.  With all my heart, I congratulate you.  Then I  may take it that my question as to your heart-wholeness is answered in  the affirmative?\"    \"Yes; and now, sir, may I ask in turn why the question?\"    \"Certainly!  I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a point  where my questions might be painful to you.\"    \"It is not merely that I love Mimi, but I have reason to look on Lady  Arabella as her enemy,\" Adam continued.    \"Her enemy?\"    \"Yes.  A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her destruction.\"    Sir Nathaniel went to the door, looked outside it and returned, locking  it carefully behind him.          CHAPTER XX--METABOLISM      \"Am I looking grave?\" asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently when he  re-entered the room.    \"You certainly are, sir.\"    \"We little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into such a  vortex.  Already we are mixed up in robbery, and probably murder, but--a  thousand times worse than all the crimes in the calendar--in an affair of  ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no end--with forces of the most  unnerving kind, which had their origin in an age when the world was  different from the world which we know.  We are going back to the origin  of superstition--to an age when dragons tore each other in their slime.  We must fear nothing--no conclusion, however improbable, almost  impossible it may be.  Life and death is hanging on our judgment, not  only for ourselves, but for others whom we love.  Remember, I count on  you as I hope you count on me.\"    \"I do, with all confidence.\"    \"Then,\" said Sir Nathaniel, \"let us think justly and boldly and fear  nothing, however terrifying it may seem.  I suppose I am to take as exact  in every detail your account of all the strange things which happened  whilst you were in Diana's Grove?\"    \"So far as I know, yes.  Of course I may be mistaken in recollection of  some detail or another, but I am certain that in the main what I have  said is correct.\"    \"You feel sure that you saw Lady Arabella seize the negro round the neck,  and drag him down with her into the hole?\"    \"Absolutely certain, sir, otherwise I should have gone to her  assistance.\"    \"We have, then, an account of what happened from an eye-witness whom we  trust--that is yourself.  We have also another account, written "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#20)"],[1,"out of bed. For a  minute they wrestled, and I opened the door. What I see was Jerry lying  flat, and Doone sitting on his chest, as calm and smiling as you please.  I closed the door quick. Jerry's too game a boy to mind being licked  fair and square, but, of course, he'd rather fight till he died than  have me or anybody else see him give up.    \"'I dunno how you got there,' says Jerry, 'but, if I don't kill you for  this later on, I'd like to shake hands with you. It was a good trick.'    \"'The gent that taught me near busted me in two with the trick of it,'  said Doone. 'S'pose I let you up. Is it to be a handshaking or  fighting?'    \"'My wind is gone for half an hour,' says Jerry, 'and my head is pretty  near jarred loose from my spinal column. I guess it'll have to be  hand-shaking today. But I warn you, Doone,' he says, 'someday I'll have  it all out with you over again.'    \"'Any time you mention,' says Doone, 'but, if you'd landed that left  when you rushed in, I would have been on the carpet, instead of you.'    \"And Jerry chuckles, feeling a pile better to think how near he'd come  to winning the fight.    \"'Wait till I jump under the shower,' says Jerry, 'and I'll be with you  again. Have you had breakfast? And what brought you to me? And who the  devil are you, Doone? Are you out of the West?'    \"He piles all these questions thick and fast at Doone, and then I seen  right off that him and Doone had made up to be pretty thick with each  other. So I went away from the door and didn't listen any more, and in  about half an hour out they walk, arm in arm, like old pals.\"    It was perfectly clear to John Mark that Ronicky had come there  purposely to break the link between him and young Jerry Smith. It was  perfectly plain why he wanted to do it.    \"How much does Jerry owe me?\" he asked suddenly.    The other drew out a pad and calculated for a moment: \"Seven thousand  eight hundred and forty-two,\" he announced with a grin, as he put back  the pad. \"That's what he's sold himself for, up to this time.\"    \"Too much in a way and not enough in another way,\" replied John Mark.  \"Listen, if he comes back, which I doubt, keep him here. Get him away  from Ronicky--dope him--dope them both. In any case, if he comes back  here, don't let him get away. You understand?\"    \"Nope, but I don't need to understand. I'll do it.\"    John Mark nodded and turned toward the door.          Chapter Eighteen      _The Spider's Web_    Only the select attended the meetings at Fernand's. It was doubly hard  to choose them. They had to have enough money to afford high play, and  they also had to lose without a murmur. It made it extremely difficult  to build up a clientele, but Fernand was equal to the task. He seemed to  smell out the character of a man or woman, to know at once how much iron  was in their souls. And, following the course of an evening's play,  Fernand knew the exact moment at which a man had had enough. It was  never twice the same for the same man. A rich fellow, who lost twenty  thousand one day and laughed at it, might groan and curse if he lost  twenty hundred a week later.    It was Fernand's desire to keep those groans and curses from being heard  in his gaming house. He extracted wallets painlessly, so to speak.    He was never crooked; and yet he would not have a dealer in his employ  unless the fellow knew every good trick of running up the deck. The  reason was that, while Fernand never cheated in order to take money away  from his customers, he very, very frequently had his men cheat in order  to give money away.    This sounds like a mad procedure for the proprietor of a gaming house,  but there were profound reasons beneath it. For one of the maxims of  Fernand--and, like every gambler, he had many of them--was that the best  way to make a man lose money is first of all to make him win it.    Such was Monsieur Frederic Fernand. And, if many compared him to  Falstaff, and many pitied the merry, fat old man for having fallen into  so hard a profession, yet there were a few who called him a bloated  spider, holding his victims, with invisible cords, and bleeding them  slowly to death.    To help him he had selected two men, both young, both shrewd, both iron  in will and nerve and courage, both apparently equally expert with the  cards, and both just as equally capable of pleasing his clients. One was  a Scotchman, McKeever; the other was a Jew, Simonds. But in looks they  were as much alike as two peas out of one pod. They hated each other  with silent, smiling hatred, because they knew that they were on trial  for their fortunes.    Tonight the Jew, Simonds, was dealing at one of the tables, and the  Scotchman, McKeever, stood at the side of the master of the house, ready  to execute his commissions. Now and again his dark eyes wandered toward  the table where the Jew sat, with the cards flashing through his  fingers. McKeever hungered to be there on the firing line! How he wished  he could feel that sifting of the polished cardboard under his finger  tips. They were playing Black Jack. He noted the smooth skill with which  Simonds buried a card. And yet the trick was not perfectly done. Had he,  McKeever, been there--    At this point he was interrupted by the easy, oily voice of M. Fernand.  \"This is an infernal nuisance!\"    McKeever raised his eyebrows and waited for an explanation. Two young  men, very young, very straight, had just come into the rooms. One he  knew to be Jerry Smith.    \"Another table and dealer wasted,\" declared M. Fernand. \"Smith--and, by  heavens, he's brought some friend of his with him!\"    \"Shall I see if I can turn them away without playing?\" asked McKeever.    \"No, not yet. Smith is a friend of John Mark. Don't forget that. Never  forget, McKeever, that the friends of John Mark must be treated with  gloves--always!\"    \"Very good,\" replied McKeever, like a pupil memorizing in class.    \"I'll see how far I can go with them,\" went on M. Fernand. He went  straight to the telephone and rang John Mark.    \"How far should I go with them?\" he asked, after he had explained that  Smith had just come in.    \"Is there someone with him?\" asked John Mark eagerly.    \"A young chap about the same age--very brown.\"    \"That's the man I want!\"    \"The man you want?\"    \"Fernand,\" said Mark, without explaining, \"those youngsters have gone  out there to make some money at your expense.\"    M. Fernand growled. \"I wish you'd stop using me as a bank, Mark,\" he  complained. \"Besides, it costs a good deal.\"    \"I pay you a tolerable interest, I believe,\" said John Mark coldly.    \"Of course, of course! Well\"--this in a manner of great  resignation--\"how much shall I let them take away?\"    \"Bleed them both to death if you want. Let them play on credit. Go as  far as you like.\"    \"Very well,\" said Fernand, \"but--\"    \"I may be out there later, myself. Good-by.\"    The face of Frederic Fernand was dark when he went back to McKeever.  \"What do you think of the fellow with Jerry Smith?\" he asked.    \"Of him?\" asked McKeever, fencing desperately for another moment, as he  stared at Ronicky Doone.    The latter was idling at a table close to the wall, running his hands  through a litter of magazines. After a moment he raised his head  suddenly and glanced across the room at McKeever. The shock of meeting  glances is almost a physical thing. And the bold, calm eyes of Ronicky  Doone lingered on McKeever and seemed to judge him and file that  judgment away.    McKeever threw himself upon the wings of his imagination. There was  something about this fellow, or his opinion would not have been asked.  What was it?    \"Well?\" asked Frederic Fernand peevishly. \"What do you think of him?\"    \"I think,\" said the other casually, \"that he's probably a Western  gunman, with a record as long as my arm.\"    \"You think that?\" asked the fat man. \"Well, I've an idea that you think  right. There's something about him that suggests action. The way he  looks about, so slowly--that is the way a fearless man is apt to look,  you know. Do you think you can sit at the table with Ronicky Doone, as  they call him, and Jerry Smith and win from them this evening?\"    \"With any sort of luck--\"    \"Leave the luck out of it. John Mark has made a special request.  Tonight, McKeever, it's going to be your work to make the luck come to  you. Do you think you can?\"    A faint smile began to dawn on the face of McKeever. Never in his life  had he heard news so sweet to his ear. It meant, in brief, that he was  to be trusted for the first time at real manipulation of the cards. His  trust in himself was complete. This would be a crushing blow for  Simonds.    \"Mind you,\" the master of the house went on, \"if you are caught at  working--\"    \"Nonsense!\" said McKeever happily. \"They can't follow my hands.\"    \"This fellow Doone--I don't know.\"    \"I'll take the chance.\"    \"If you're caught I turn you out. You hear? Are you willing to take the  risk?\"    \"Yes,\" said McKeever, very pale, but determined.    At the right moment McKeever approached Jerry and Ronicky, dark,  handsome, smoothly amiable. He was clever enough to make no indirect  effort to introduce his topic. \"I see that you gentlemen are looking  about,\" he said. \"Yonder is a clear table for us. Do you agree, Mr.  Smith?\"    Jerry Smith nodded, and, having introduced Ronicky Doone, the three  started for the table which had been indicated.    It was in an alcove, apart from the sweep of big rooms which were given  over to the players. It lay, too, conveniently in range of the beat of  Frederic Fernand, as he moved slowly back and forth, over a limited  territory and stopped, here and there for a word, here and there for a  smile. He was smoothing the way for dollars to slide out of wallets. Now  he deliberately stopped the party in their progress to the alcove.    \"I have to meet you,\" he said to Ronicky. \"You remind me of a friend of  my father, a"]]]
