He was dreadfully amazed at death, as being, indeed, very  unfit to die. However, when he found it was inevitable, he began to  prepare for it as well as he was able. His relations now afforded him  some little relief, and after having made as ample a confession as he  was able, he suffered at Tyburn with the two above-mentioned  malefactors, Hawes and Wright, being then but a little above nineteen  years of age.          The Life of JOHN SMITH, a Murderer      As idleness is fatal to youth, so it and ill-company become not seldom  so even to persons in years. John Smith, of whose extraction we can say  nothing, had served with a very good character in a regiment of foot,  during Queen Anne's wars in Flanders. His captain took a particular  liking to him, and from his boldness and fierce courage, to which he  himself was also greatly inclined, they did abundance of odd actions  during the War, some of which may not be unentertaining to the reader,  if I mention.    The army lying encamped almost over against that of the French king,  foraging was become very dangerous, and hardly a party went out without  a skirmish. John's master, the captain, having been out with a party,  and being over powered by the French, were obliged to leave their  trusses behind them. When they returned to the camp, Smith was ordered  to lead his master's horse out into the field between the two camps,  that the poor creature might be able to pick up a little pasture. John  had not attended his horse long before, at the distance of about half a  mile, he saw a boy leading two others, at the foot of a hill which  joined to the French fortification. As John's livery was yellow, and he  spoke Walloon bad enough to be taken for a Frenchman, he ventured to  stake the Captain's horse down where it was feeding, and without the  least apprehension of the risk he ran, went across to the fellow who was  feeding his horses under the French lines. He proceeded with so much  caution that he was within a stone's throw of the boy, before he  perceived him. From the colour of his clothes, and the place where they  were, immediately under the French camp, the lad took him for one of  their own people, and therefore answered him very civilly when he asked  what o'clock it was, and whom he belonged to. But John no sooner  observed from the boy's turning his horses, that the hill lay again  between them and the French soldiers, than clapping his hand suddenly  upon the boy's throat and tripping up his heels, he clapped a gag in his  mouth, which he had cut for that purpose; and leaving him with his hands  tied behind him upon the ground, he rode clear off with the best of the  horses, notwithstanding that the boy had alarmed the French camp, and he  had some hundred shot sent after him.    The captain and Smith were out one day a-foraging, and one of the  officers of their party who was known to have a hundred pistoles about  him, was killed in a skirmish, and neither party dared to bring off the  body for fear of the other, it being just dark, each expected a  reinforcement from the camp. Smith told his captain that if he'd give  him one half of the gold for fetching, he would venture; and his offer  being gladly accepted, he accordingly crept two hundred yards upon his  belly, and after he had picked the purse out of the dead man's pockets,  returned without being either seen or suspected.    When the army was disbanded, Smith betook himself to the sea, and served  under Admiral Byng,[15] in the fight at Messina; but on the return of  that fleet from the Mediterranean, being discharged he came up to  London, where having squandered his money, he did some petty thefts to  get more. To this he was induced chiefly by the company of one Woolford,  who was executed, and at whose execution Smith was present, and soon  after cohabited with his wife. But not long after this, Smith meeting  with one Sarah Thompson, an old acquaintance of his, who had it seems  left him to live with another fellow, he took it into his head thereupon  to use her very roughly, and clapping a pistol to her breast, threatened  with abundance of ill-language to shoot her. This occasioned a great  fray in the place where it happened, which was near the Hermitage  towards Wapping, and several persons running to take the woman away, and  to seize him, in order to prevent murder, Smith fired his pistol, and  unhappily killed one Matthew Walden, who was amongst the number. The mob  immediately crowded upon him and seized him, and the fact appearing very  clear on his trial, he was convicted at the next sessions at the Old  Bailey.    He behaved himself with great resolution, professed himself extremely  sorry, as well for the many vices he had been guilty of as for that last  bloody act which brought him to his shameful end. He especially  recommended to all who spoke to him, to avoid the snares and delusions  of lewd women; and at the place of execution delivered the following  paper. He was about forty years of age when he died, being the 8th day  of February, 1722, at Tyburn.        The paper delivered by John Smith at the place of execution        I was born of honest parents, bred to the sea, and lived honest,      'till I was led aside by lewd women. I then robbed on ships, and      never robbed on shore. I had no design to kill the woman who jilted      me, and left me for another man, but only to terrify her, for I      could have shot her when the loaded pistol was at her breast, but I      curbed my passion, and only threw a candle-stick at her. I confess      my cruelty towards my wife, who is a woman too good for me, but I      was at first forced to forsake her for debt, and go to sea. I hope      in God none will reflect on her, or my poor innocent children, who      could not help my sad passion, and more sad death. Written by me,        John Smith    FOOTNOTES:       [15] George Byng, later created Viscount Torrington, was sent          with a fleet for the protection of Sicily against the Spaniards.          He found them besieging Messina, whereupon he gave their fleet          battle and gained a smashing victory at Cape Passaro, 31 July,          1718.          The Life of JAMES SHAW, _alias_ SMITH, a Highwayman and Murderer      James Shaw, otherwise Smith (for by both these names he went, nor am I  able to say which was his true one) was the son of parents both of  circumstances and inclination to have given him a very good education if  he would have received it. The unsettledness of his temper was  heightened by that indulgence with which he was treated by his  relations, who permitted him to make trial of several trades, though he  could not be brought to like any. Indeed, he stayed so long with a  forger of gun-locks, as to learn something of his art, which sometimes  he practised and thereby got money; but generally speaking he chose  rather to acquire it by easier means.    I cannot take upon me to say at what time he began to rob upon the road,  or take to any other villainy of that sort, but 'tis certain that if he  himself were to be believed, it was in a great measure owing to a bad  wife; for when he, by his labour, got nine shillings a week, and used to  return home very weary in the evening, he generally found nobody there  to receive him, or to get ready his supper, but everything in the  greatest confusion, without any person to take care of what little he  had. This, as he would have had it believed, was the source of his  misfortunes and necessities, as it was also the occasion of his taking  such fatal methods to relieve them.    The Hampstead Road was that in which he chiefly robbed, and he could not  be persuaded that there was any great crime in taking away the  superfluous cash of those who lavish it in vanity and luxury, or from  those who procure it by cheating and gaming; and under these two classes  Shaw pretended to rank all who frequented the Wells or Belsize, and it  is to be much feared that in this respect he was not very far out.  Amongst the many adventures which befell him in his expeditions on the  road, there are one or two which it may not be improper to take notice  of.    One evening, as he was patrolling thereabouts, he came up to a chariot  in which there was a certain famous justice, who happened to have won  about four hundred pounds at play, and Count Ui----n, a famous foreign  gamester, that has made many different figures about this town. No  sooner was the coach stopped by Shaw and another person on horseback,  but the Squire slipped the money he had won behind the seat of the  coach, and the Count having little to lose, seemed not very uneasy at  the accident. The highwaymen no sooner had demanded their money, but the  Count gave two or three pieces of foreign gold, and the gentleman, in  hopes by this means of getting rid of them, presented them with twenty  guineas.    _Why, really, sir_, said Shaw, on the receipt of the gold, _this were a  handsome compliment from another person, but methinks you might have  spared a little more out of the long bag you brought from the gaming  table. Come, gentlemen, get out, get out, we must examine the nest a  little, I fancy the goldfinches are not yet flown._ Upon this, they both  got out of the chariot, and Shaw shaking the cushion that covered the  seat hastily, the long bag fell out with its mouth open, and all its  bright contents were scattered on the ground. The two knights of the  road began to pick them up as fast as they could, and while the justice  cursed this unlucky accident which had nicked him, after he had nicked  all the gamesters at the Wells, the Count, who thought swearing an  unprofitable exercise, began to gather as fast as they. A good deal of  company coming in sight just as they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#20)"],[1," wise, was Bishop  of Florence, there came thither a Catalan gentleman, Messer Dego della  Ratta by name, being King Ruberto's marshal. Now Dego being very goodly  of person, and inordinately fond of women, it so befell that of the  ladies of Florence she that he regarded with especial favour was the very  beautiful niece of a brother of the said bishop. And having learned that  her husband, though of good family, was but a caitiff, and avaricious in  the last degree, he struck a bargain with him that he should lie one  night with the lady for five hundred florins of gold: whereupon he had  the same number of popolins(1) of silver, which were then current,  gilded, and having lain with the lady, albeit against her will, gave them  to her husband. Which coming to be generally known, the caitiff husband  was left with the loss and the laugh against him; and the bishop, like a  wise man, feigned to know nought of the affair. And so the bishop and the  marshal being much together, it befell that on St. John's day, as they  rode side by side down the street whence they start to run the palio,(2)  and took note of the ladies, the bishop espied a young gentlewoman, whom  this present pestilence has reft from us, Monna Nonna de' Pulci by name,  a cousin of Messer Alesso Rinucci, whom you all must know; whom, for that  she was lusty and fair, and of excellent discourse and a good courage,  and but just settled with her husband in Porta San Piero, the bishop  presented to the marshal; and then, being close beside her, he laid his  hand on the marshal's shoulder and said to her:--\"Nonna, what thinkest  thou of this gentleman? That thou mightst make a conquest of him?\" Which  words the lady resented as a jibe at her honour, and like to tarnish it  in the eyes of those, who were not a few, in whose hearing they were  spoken. Wherefore without bestowing a thought upon the vindication of her  honour, but being minded to return blow for blow, she retorted  hastily:--\"Perchance, Sir, he might not make a conquest of me; but if he  did so, I should want good money.\" The answer stung both the marshal and  the bishop to the quick, the one as contriver of the scurvy trick played  upon the bishop's brother in regard of his niece, the other as thereby  outraged in the person of his brother's niece; insomuch that they dared  not look one another in the face, but took themselves off in shame and  silence, and said never a word more to her that day.    In such a case, then, the lady having received a bite, 'twas allowable in  her wittily to return it.    (1) A coin of the same size and design as the fiorino d'oro, but worth  only two soldi.    (2) A sort of horse-race still in vogue at Siena.      NOVEL IV.    --  Chichibio, cook to Currado Gianfigliazzi, owes his safety to a ready  answer, whereby he converts Currado's wrath into laughter, and evades the  evil fate with which Currado had threatened him.  --    Lauretta being now silent, all lauded Nonna to the skies; after which  Neifile received the queen's command to follow suit, and thus began:--    Albeit, loving ladies, ready wit not seldom ministers words apt and  excellent and congruous with the circumstances of the speakers, 'tis also  true that Fortune at times comes to the aid of the timid, and  unexpectedly sets words upon the tongue, which in a quiet hour the  speaker could never have found for himself: the which 'tis my purpose to  shew you by my story.    Currado Gianfigliazzi, as the eyes and ears of each of you may bear  witness, has ever been a noble citizen of our city, open-handed and  magnificent, and one that lived as a gentleman should with hounds and  hawks, in which, to say nothing at present of more important matters, he  found unfailing delight. Now, having one day hard by Peretola despatched  a crane with one of his falcons, finding it young and plump, he sent it  to his excellent cook, a Venetian, Chichibio by name, bidding him roast  it for supper and make a dainty dish of it. Chichibio, who looked, as he  was, a very green-head, had dressed the crane, and set it to the fire and  was cooking it carefully, when, the bird being all but roasted, and the  fumes of the cooking very strong, it so chanced that a girl, Brunetta by  name, that lived in the same street, and of whom Chichibio was greatly  enamoured, came into the kitchen, and perceiving the smell and seeing the  bird, began coaxing Chichibio to give her a thigh. By way of answer  Chichibio fell a singing:--\"You get it not from me, Madam Brunetta, you  get it not from me.\" Whereat Madam Brunetta was offended, and said to  him:--\"By God, if thou givest it me not, thou shalt never have aught from  me to pleasure thee.\" In short there was not a little altercation; and in  the end Chichibio, fain not to vex his mistress, cut off one of the  crane's thighs, and gave it to her. So the bird was set before Currado  and some strangers that he had at table with him, and Currado, observing  that it had but one thigh, was surprised, and sent for Chichibio, and  demanded of him what was become of the missing thigh. Whereto the  mendacious Venetian answered readily:--\"The crane, Sir, has but one thigh  and one leg.\" \"What the devil?\" rejoined Currado in a rage: \"so the crane  has but one thigh and one leg? thinkst thou I never saw crane before  this?\" But Chichibio continued:--\"'Tis even so as I say, Sir; and, so  please you, I will shew you that so it is in the living bird.\" Currado  had too much respect for his guests to pursue the topic; he only  said:--\"Since thou promisest to shew me in the living bird what I have  never seen or heard tell of, I bid thee do so to-morrow, and I shall be  satisfied, but if thou fail, I swear to thee by the body of Christ that I  will serve thee so that thou shalt ruefully remember my name for the rest  of thy days.\"    No more was said of the matter that evening, but on the morrow, at  daybreak, Currado, who had by no means slept off his wrath, got up still  swelling therewith, and ordered his horses, mounted Chichibio on a  hackney, and saying to him:--\"We shall soon see which of us lied  yesternight, thou or I,\" set off with him for a place where there was  much water, beside which there were always cranes to be seen about dawn.  Chichibio, observing that Currado's ire was unabated, and knowing not how  to bolster up his lie, rode by Currado's side in a state of the utmost  trepidation, and would gladly, had he been able, have taken to flight;  but, as he might not, he glanced, now ahead, now aback, now aside, and  saw everywhere nought but cranes standing on two feet. However, as they  approached the river, the very first thing they saw upon the bank was a  round dozen of cranes standing each and all on one foot, as is their  wont, when asleep. Which Chichibio presently pointed out to Currado,  saying:--\"Now may you see well enough, Sir, that 'tis true as I said  yesternight, that the crane has but one thigh and one leg; mark but how  they stand over there.\" Whereupon Currado:--\"Wait,\" quoth he, \"and I will  shew thee that they have each thighs and legs twain.\" So, having drawn a  little nigher to them, he ejaculated, \"Oho!\" Which caused the cranes to  bring each the other foot to the ground, and, after hopping a step or  two, to take to flight. Currado then turned to Chichibio, saying:--\"How  now, rogue? art satisfied that the bird has thighs and legs twain?\"  Whereto Chichibio, all but beside himself with fear, made answer:--\"Ay,  Sir; but you cried not, oho! to our crane of yestereve: had you done so,  it would have popped its other thigh and foot forth, as these have done.\"  Which answer Currado so much relished, that, all his wrath changed to  jollity and laughter:--\"Chichibio,\" quoth he, \"thou art right, indeed I  ought to have so done.\"    Thus did Chichibio by his ready and jocund retort arrest impending evil,  and make his peace with his master.      NOVEL V.    --  Messer Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto, the painter, journeying  together from Mugello, deride one another's scurvy appearance.  --    Neifile being silent, and the ladies having made very merry over  Chichibio's retort, Pamfilo at the queen's command thus spoke:--Dearest  ladies, if Fortune, as Pampinea has shewn us, does sometimes bide  treasures most rich of native worth in the obscurity of base occupations,  so in like manner 'tis not seldom found that Nature has enshrined  prodigies of wit in the most ignoble of human forms. Whereof a notable  example is afforded by two of our citizens, of whom I purpose for a brief  while to discourse. The one, Messer Forese da Rabatta by name, was short  and deformed of person and withal flat-cheeked and flat-nosed, insomuch  that never a Baroncio(1) had a visage so misshapen but his would have  shewed as hideous beside it; yet so conversant was this man with the  laws, that by not a few of those well able to form an opinion he was  reputed a veritable storehouse of civil jurisprudence. The other, whose  name was Giotto, was of so excellent a wit that, let Nature, mother of  all, operant ever by continual revolution of the heavens, fashion what  she would, he with his style and pen and pencil would depict its like on  such wise that it shewed not as its like, but rather as the thing itself,  insomuch that the visual sense of men did often err in regard thereof,  mistaking for real that which was but painted. Wherefore, having brought  back to light that art which had for many ages lain buried beneath the  blunders of those who painted rather to delight the eyes of the ignorant  than to satisfy the intelligence of the wise, he may deservedly be called  one of the lights that compose the glory of Florence, and the more so,  the more lowly was the spirit in which he won that glory, who, albeit he  was, while he yet lived, the master of others, yet did ever refuse to be  called their master. And this title that he rejected adorned him with a  lustre the"]]]
