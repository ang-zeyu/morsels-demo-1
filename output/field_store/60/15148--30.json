Benaiah asked Ashmedai why, when he saw the blind man straying,      he so promptly interfered to guide him? \"Because,\" he replied,      \"it was proclaimed in heaven that that man was perfectly      righteous, and that whosoever did him a good turn would earn a      title to a place in the world of the future.\" \"And when thou      sawest the man overcome with wine wandering out of his way, why      didst thou put him right again?\" Ashmedai said, \"Because it was      made known in heaven that that man was thoroughly bad, and I      have done him a good service that he might not lose all, but      receive some good in the world that now is.\" \"Well, and why      didst thou weep when thou sawest the merry wedding-party pass?\"      \"Because,\" said he, \"the bridegroom was fated to die within      thirty days and the bride must needs wait thirteen years for her      husband's brother, who is now but an infant\" (see Deut. xxv.      5-10). \"Why didst thou laugh so when the man ordered a pair of      shoes that would last him seven years?\" Ashmedai replied,      \"Because the man himself was not sure of living seven days.\"      \"And why,\" asked Benaiah, \"didst thou jeer when thou sawest the      conjuror at his tricks?\" \"Because,\" said Ashmedai, \"the man was      at that very time sitting on a princely treasure, and he did      not, with all his pretension, know that it was under him.\"        Having once acquired a power over Ashmedai, Solomon detained him      till the building of the Temple was completed. One day after      this, when they were alone, it is related that Solomon,      addressing him, asked him, \"What, pray, is your superiority over      us, if it be true, as it is written (Num. xxiii. 22), 'He has      the strength of a unicorn,' and the word 'strength,' as      tradition alleges, means 'ministering angels,' and the word      'unicorn' means 'devils'?\" Ashmedai replied, \"Just take this      chain from my neck, and give me thy signet-ring, and I'll soon      show thee my superiority.\" No sooner did Solomon comply with      this request, than Ashmedai, snatching him up, swallowed him;      then stretching forth his wings--one touching the heaven and the      other the earth--he vomited him out again to a distance of four      hundred miles. It is with reference to this time that Solomon      says (Eccl. i. 3; ii. 10), \"What profit hath a man of all his      labor which he taketh under the sun? This is my portion of all      my labor.\" What does the word this mean? Upon this point Rav and      Samuel are at variance, for the one says it means his staff, the      other holds that it means his garment or water-jug; and that      with one or other Solomon went about from door to door begging;      and wherever he came he said (Eccl. i. 12), \"I, the preacher,      was king over Israel in Jerusalem.\" When in his wanderings he      came to the house of the Sanhedrin, the Rabbis reasoned and      said, if he were mad he would not keep repeating the same things      over and over again; therefore what does he mean? They therefore      inquired of Benaiah, \"Does the king ask thee into his presence?\"      He replied, \"No!\" They then sent to see whether the king visited      the hareem. And the answer to this was, \"Yes, he comes.\" Then      the Rabbis sent word back that they should look at his feet, for      the devil's feet are like those of a cock. The reply was, \"He      comes to us in stockings.\" Upon this information the Rabbis      escorted Solomon back to the palace, and restored to him the      chain and the ring, on both of which the name of God was      engraven. Arrayed with these, Solomon advanced straightway into      the presence-chamber. Ashmedai sat at that moment on the throne,      but as soon as he saw Solomon enter, he took fright and raising      his wings, flew away, shrieking back into invisibility. In spite      of this, Solomon continued in great fear of him; and this      explains that which is written (Song of Songs, iii. 7, 8),      \"Behold the bed which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are      about it, of the valiant of Israel; they all hold swords, being      expert in war; every man has his sword upon his thigh, because      of fear in the night.\" (See Gittin, fol. 68, cols, 1, 2.)        Ashmedai is the Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit, iii. 8, vi. 14,      etc, The Shameer is mentioned in Jer. xvii. i; Ezek. iii. 9;      Zech. vii. 12. The Seventy in the former passage and the Vulgate      passim take it for the diamond.    Six things are said respecting the children of men, in three of which  they are like angels, and in three they are like animals. They have  intelligence like angels, they walk erect like angels, and they converse  in the holy tongue like angels. They eat and drink like animals, they  generate and multiply like animals, and they relieve nature like  animals.    _Chaggigah_, fol. 16, col. 1.    Six months did the Shechinah hesitate to depart from the midst of Israel  in the wilderness, in hopes that they would repent. At last, when they  persisted in impenitence, the Shechinah said, \"May their bones be  blown;\" as it is written (Job xi. 20), \"The eyes of the wicked shall  fail, they shall not escape, and their hopes shall be as the blowing out  of the spirit.\"    _Rosh Hashanah_, fol. 31, col. 1.    Six names were given to Solomon:--Solomon, Jedidiah, Koheleth, Son of  Jakeh, Agur, and Lemuel.    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, chap. 39.    Six years old was Dinah when she gave birth to Asenath, whom she bore  unto Shechem.    _Sophrim_, chap. 21.    \"And the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household\" (2 Sam. vi. 11).  In what did the blessing consist? Rav Yehudah bar Zavidah says it  consisted in this, that Hamoth, his wife, and her eight daughters-in-law  gave birth each to six children at a time. (This is proved from 1 Chron.  xxvi. 5, 8.)    _Berachoth_, fol. 63, col. 2.    Six things were done by Hezekiah the king, but the sages praised him for  three only:--(1.) He dragged the bones of his father Ahaz on a hurdle of  ropes, for this they commended him; (2.) he broke to pieces the brazen  serpent, for this they commended him; (3.) he hid the Book of Remedies,  and for this too they praised him. For three they blamed him:--(1.) He  stripped the doors of the Temple and sent the gold thereof to the King  of Assyria; (2.) he stopped up the upper aqueduct of Gihon; (3.) he  intercalated the month Nisan.    _P'sachim_, fol. 56, col. 1.    The hiding of the Book of Remedies, harsh and inhuman as it might seem,  was dictated by high moral considerations. It seemed right that the  transgressor should feel the weight of his sin in the suffering that  followed, and that the edge of judgment should not be dulled by a too  easy access to anodyne applications. The reason for stopping the  aqueduct of Gihon is given in 2 Chron. xxxii. 3, 4. The inhabitants of  Jerusalem did the very same thing when the Crusaders besieged the city,  A.D. 1099. Rashi tries to explain why this stratagem was not commended;  the reason he gives is that Hezekiah ought to have trusted God, who had  said (2 Kings xix. 34), \"I will defend the city.\"    Six things are said of the horse:--It is wanton, it delights in the  strife of war, it is high-spirited, it despises sleep, it eats much and  it voids little. There are some that say it would fain kill its own  master.    Ibid., fol. 113, col. 2.    The Rabbis have taught that there are six sorts of fire:--(1.) Fire that  eats but drinks not, i.e., common fire; (2.) fire that drinks but does  not eat, i.e., a fever; (3.) fire that eats and drinks, i.e., Elijah, as  it is written (1 Kings xviii. 38), \"And licked up the water that was in  the trench;\" (4.) fire that burns up moist things as soon as dry, i.e.,  the fire on the altar; (5.) fire that counteracts other fire, i.e., like  that of Gabriel; (6.) fire that consumes fire, for the Master has said  (Sanhed., fol. 38, col. 2), \"God stretched out His finger among the  angels and consumed them,\" i.e., by His own essential fire.    _Yoma_, fol. 21, col. 2.    For six months David was afflicted with leprosy; for it is said (Ps. li.  7), \"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be  whiter than snow.\" At that time the Shechinah departed from him; for it  is said (Ps. li. 12), \"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;\" and  the Sanhedrin kept aloof from him, for it is said (Ps. cxix. 79), \"Let  those that fear thee turn unto me.\" That this ailment lasted six months  is proved from 1 Kings ii. 11, where it is said, \"And the days that  David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in  Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem;\" whereas in 2  Sam. v. 5, it is said, \"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and  six months.\" The reason why these six months are omitted in Kings is  because during that period he was afflicted with leprosy.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 107, col. 1.    The tables of stone were six ells long, six broad, and three thick.    _Nedarim_, fol. 38, col. 8.        It may help the reader to some idea of the strength of Moses if      we work out arithmetically the size and probable weight of these      stone slabs according to the Talmud. Taking the cubit or ell at      its lowest estimate, that is eighteen inches, each slab, being      nine feet long, nine feet wide, and four and a half feet thick,      would weigh upward of twenty-eight tons, reckoning thirteen      cubic feet to the ton,--the right estimate for such stone as is      quarried from the Sinaitic cliff. The figures are 9 X 9 X 9/2 =      729/2 = 364.5 X 173.5 = 63240.75 = 28 tons, 4 cwt., 2 qrs., 16      lbs. avoirdupois.    The Rabbis have taught that these six things possess medicinal  virtue:--Cabbage, lungwort, beetroot, water, and certain parts of the  offal of animals, and some also say little fishes.    _Avodah Zarah_, fol."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#20)"],[1,"consciousness--Ahankara--thereto  appertaining, are from an Anima Mundi, or what in the Sankhya philosophy  is called Prakriti.  My utmost expectations will have been exceeded if  it should happen that any considerations here offered should throw even  a faint suggestive light upon the bearings of this great problem.  It  may be that the mere irreconcilability of all that is characteristic of  the temporal Ego with the conditions of the superior life--if that can  be made apparent--will incline you to regard the latter rather as the  Redeemer, that has indeed to be born within us for our salvation and our  immortality, than as the inmost, central, and inseparable principle of  our phenomenal life.  It may be that by the light of such reflections  the sense of identity will present no insuperable difficulty to the  conception of its contingency, or to the recognition that the mere  consciousness which fails to attach itself to a higher principle is no  guarantee of an eternal individuality.    It is only by a survey of individuality, regarded as the source of all  our affections, thoughts, and actions, that we can realize its intrinsic  worthlessness;  and only when we have brought ourselves to a real and  felt acknowledgment of that fact, can we accept with full understanding  those \"hard sayings\" of sacred authority which bid us \"die to  ourselves,\" and which proclaim the necessity of a veritable new birth.  This mystic death and birth is the key-note of all profound religious  teaching;  and that which distinguishes the ordinary religious mind from  spiritual insight is just the tendency to interpret these expressions as  merely figurative, or, indeed, to overlook them altogether.    Of all the reproaches which modern Spiritualism, with the prospect it is  thought to hold out of an individual temporal immortality, has had to  encounter, there is none that we can less afford to neglect than that  which represents it as an ideal essentially egotistical and borne.  True  it is that our critics do us injustice through ignorance of the enlarged  views as to the progress of the soul in which the speculations of  individual Spiritualists coincide with many remarkable spirit teachings.  These are, undoubtedly, a great advance upon popular theological  opinions, while some of them go far to satisfy the claim of Spiritualism  to be regarded as a religion.  Nevertheless, that slight estimate of  individuality, as we know it, which in one view too easily allies itself  to materialism, is also the attitude of spiritual idealism, and is  seemingly at variance with the excessive value placed by Spiritualists  on the discovery of our mere psychic survival.  The idealist may  recognise this survival;  but, whether he does so or not, he occupies a  post of vantage when he tells us that it is of no ultimate importance.  For he, like the Spiritualist who proclaims his \"proof palpable of  immortality,\" is thinking of the mere temporal, self-regarding  consciousness--its sensibilities, desires, gratifications, and  affections--which are unimportant absolutely, that is to say, their  importance is relative solely to the individual.  There is, indeed, no  more characteristic outbirth of materialism than that which makes a  teleological centre of the individual.  Ideas have become mere  abstractions;  the only reality is the infinitely little.  Thus  utilitarianism can see in the State only a collection of individuals  whose \"greatest happiness,\" mutually limited by nice adjustment to the  requirements of \"the greatest numbers,\" becomes the supreme end of  government and law.  And it cannot, I think, be pretended that  Spiritualists in general have advanced beyond this substitution of a  relative for an absolute standard.  Their \"glad tidings of great joy\"  are not truly religious.  They have regard to the perpetuation in time  of that lower consciousness whose manifestations, delights, and activity  are in time, and of time alone.  Their glorious message is not  essentially different from that which we can conceive as brought to us  by some great alchemist, who had discovered the secret of conferring  upon us and upon our friends a mundane perpetuity of youth and health.  Its highest religious claim is that it enlarges the horizon of our  opportunities.  As such, then, let us hail it with gratitude and relief;  but, on peril of our salvation, if I may not say of our immortality, let  us not repose upon a prospect which is, at best, one of renewed labours,  and trials, and efforts to be free even of that very life whose only  value is opportunity.    To estimate the value of individuality, we cannot do better than regard  man in his several mundane relations, supposing that either of these  might become the central, actuating focus of his being--his \"ruling  love,\" as Swedenborg would call it--displacing his mere egoism, or  self-love, thrusting that more to the circumference, and identifying  him, so to speak, with that circle of interests to which all his  energies and affections relate. Outside this substituted Ego we are to  suppose that he has no conscience, no desire, no will.  Just as the  entirely selfish man views the whole of life, so far as it can really  interest him solely in relation to his individual well-being, so our  supposed man of a family, of a society, of a Church, or a State, has no  eye for any truth or any interest more abstract or more individual than  that of which he may be rightly termed the incarnation.  History shows  approximations to this ideal man. Such a one, for instance, I conceive  to have been Loyola;  such another, possibly, is Bismarck.  Now these  men have ceased to be individuals in their own eyes, so far as concerns  any value attaching to their own special individualities.  They are  devotees.  A certain \"conversion\" has been effected, by which from mere  individuals they have become \"representative\" men.  And we--the  individuals--esteem them precisely in proportion to the remoteness from  individualism of the spirit that actuates them. As the circle of  interests to which they are \"devoted\" enlarges--that is to say, as the  dross of individualism is purged away--we accord them indulgence,  respect, admiration and love. From self to the family, from the family  to the sect or society, from the sect or society to the Church (in no  denominational sense) and State, there is the ascending scale and  widening circle, the successive transitions which make the worth of an  individual depend on the more or less complete subversion of his  individuality by a more comprehensive soul or spirit.  The very modesty  which suppresses, as far as possible, the personal pronoun in our  addresses to others, testifies to our sense that we are hiding away some  utterly insignificant and unworthy thing; a thing that has no business  even to be, except in that utter privacy which is rather a sleep and a  rest than living.  Well, but in the above instances, even those most  remote from sordid individuality, we have fallen far short of that ideal  in which the very conception of the partial, the atomic, is lost in the  abstraction of universal being, transfigured in the glory of a Divine  personality.  You are familiar with Swedenborg's distinction between  discrete and continuous degrees. Hitherto we have seen how man--the  individual--may rise continuously by throwing himself heart and soul  into the living interests of the world, and lose his own limitations by  adoption of a larger mundane spirit. But still he has but ascended  nearer to his own mundane source, that soul of the world, or Prakriti,  to which, if I must not too literally insist on it, I may still resort  as a convenient figure.  To transcend it, he must advance by the  discrete degree.  No simple \"bettering\" of the ordinary self, which  leaves it alive, as the focus--the French word \"foyer\" is the more  expressive--of his thoughts and actions;  not even that identification  with higher interests in the world's plane just spoken of, is, or can  progressively become, in the least adequate to the realization of his  Divine ideal.  This \"bettering\" of our present nature, it alone being  recognized as essential, albeit capable of \"improvement,\" is a  commonplace, and to use a now familiar term a \"Philistine,\" conception.  It is the substitution of the continuous for the discrete degree.  It is  a compromise with our dear old familiar selves.  \"And Saul and the  people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of  the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not  utterly destroy them;  but everything that was vile and refuse, that  they destroyed utterly.\"  We know how little acceptable that compromise  was to the God of Israel;  and no illustration can be more apt than this  narrative, which we may well, as we would fain, believe to be rather  typical than historical.  Typical of that indiscriminate and radical  sacrifice, or \"vastation,\" of our lower nature, which is insisted upon  as the one thing needful by all, or nearly all,* the great religions of  the world.  No language could seem more purposely chosen to indicate  that it is the individual nature itself, and not merely its accidental  evils, that has to be abandoned and annihilated.  It is not denied that  what was spared was good;  there is no suggestion of a universal  infection of physical or moral evil;  it is simply that what is good and  useful relatively to a lower state of being must perish with it if the  latter is to make way for something better.  And the illustration is the  more suitable in that the purpose of this paper is not ethical, but  points to a metaphysical conclusion, though without any attempt at  metaphysical exposition.  There is no question here of moral  distinctions; they are neither denied nor affirmed.  According to the  highest moral standard, 'A' may be a most virtuous and estimable person.  According to the lowest,"]]]
