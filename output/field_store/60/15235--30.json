ANSWER: Although the words \"at the hour of dawn\" are used in the Book of  God, it is acceptable to God at the earliest dawn of day, between dawn and  sunrise, or even up to two hours after sunrise.    16. QUESTION: Is the ordinance that the body of the deceased should be  carried no greater distance than one hour's journey applicable to  transport by both land and sea?    ANSWER: This command applieth to distances by sea as well as by land,  whether it is an hour by steamship or by rail; the intention is the hour's  time, whatever the means of transport. The sooner the burial taketh place,  however, the more fitting and acceptable will it be.    17. QUESTION: What procedure should be followed on the discovery of lost  property?    ANSWER: If such property be found in the town, its discovery is to be  announced once by the town crier. If the owner of the property is then  found, it should be delivered up to him. Otherwise, the finder of the  property should wait one year, and if, during this period, the owner  cometh to light, the finder should receive from him the crier's fee and  restore to him his property; only if the year should pass without the  owner's being identified may the finder take possession of the property  himself. If the value of the property is less than or equal to the crier's  fee, the finder should wait a single day from the time of its discovery,  at the end of which, if the owner hath not come to light, he may himself  appropriate it; and in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited  area, the finder should observe a three days' wait, on the passing of  which period, if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to  take possession of his find.    18. QUESTION: With reference to the ablutions: if, for example, a person  hath just bathed his entire body, must he still perform his ablutions?    ANSWER: The commandment regarding ablutions must, in any case, be  observed.    19. QUESTION: Should a person plan to migrate from his country, and his  wife be opposed and the disagreement culminate in divorce, and should his  preparations for the journey extend until a year hath passed, may this  period be counted as the year of patience, or should the day the couple  part be regarded as the starting-point of that year?    ANSWER: The starting-point for computation is the day the couple part, and  if, therefore, they have separated a year before the husband's departure,  and if the fragrance of affection hath not been renewed between the  couple, divorce may take place. Otherwise the year must be counted from  the day of his departure, and the conditions set forth in the  Kitab-i-Aqdas observed.    20. QUESTION: Concerning the age of maturity with respect to religious  duties.    ANSWER: The age of maturity is fifteen for both men and women.    21. QUESTION: Concerning the holy verse: \"When travelling, if ye should  stop and rest in some safe spot, perform ye ... a single prostration in  place of each unsaid Obligatory Prayer...\"    ANSWER: This prostration is to compensate for obligatory prayer omitted in  the course of travel, and by reason of insecure circumstances. If, at the  time of prayer, the traveller should find himself at rest in a secure  place, he should perform that prayer. This provision regarding the  compensating prostration applieth both at home and on a journey.    22. QUESTION: Concerning the definition of a journey.(15)    ANSWER: The definition of a journey is nine hours by the clock. Should the  traveller stop in a place, anticipating that he will stay there for no  less than one month by the Bayan reckoning, it is incumbent on him to keep  the Fast; but if for less than one month, he is exempt from fasting. If he  arriveth during the Fast at a place where he is to stay one month  according to the Bayan, he should not observe the Fast till three days  have elapsed, thereafter keeping it throughout the remainder of its  course; but if he come to his home, where he hath heretofore been  permanently resident, he must commence his fast upon the first day after  his arrival.    23. QUESTION: Concerning the punishment of the adulterer and adulteress.    Nine Mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals are payable for the first offence, eighteen for the  second, thirty-six for the third, and so on, each succeeding fine being  double the preceding. The weight of one mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qal is equivalent to  nineteen nak{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}uds in accordance with the specification of the Bayan.    24. QUESTION: Concerning hunting.    ANSWER: He saith, exalted be He: \"If ye should hunt with beasts or birds  of prey\" and so forth. Other means, such as bows and arrows, guns, and  similar equipment employed in hunting, are also included. If, however,  traps or snares are used, and the game dieth before it can be reached, it  is unlawful for consumption.    25. QUESTION: Concerning the pilgrimage.    ANSWER: It is an obligation to make pilgrimage to one of the two sacred  Houses; but as to which, it is for the pilgrim to decide.    26. QUESTION: Concerning the dowry.    ANSWER: Regarding dowry, the intention of contenting oneself with the  lowest level is nineteen mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of silver.    27. QUESTION: Concerning the sacred verse: \"If, however, news should reach  her of her husband's death\", etc.    ANSWER: With reference to waiting a \"fixed number of months\" a period of  nine months is intended.    28. QUESTION: Again inquiry hath been made about the teacher's share of  the inheritance.    ANSWER: Should the teacher have passed away, one third of his share of the  inheritance reverteth to the House of Justice, and the remaining two  thirds pass to the deceased's, and not the teacher's, offspring.    29. QUESTION: Again inquiry hath been made about the pilgrimage.    ANSWER: By pilgrimage to the sacred House, which is enjoined upon men, is  intended both the Most Great House in Bag{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}dad and the House of the  Primal Point in S{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}iraz; pilgrimage to either of these Houses sufficeth.  They may thus make pilgrimage to whichever lieth nearer to the place where  they reside.    30. QUESTION: Concerning the verse: \"he who would take into his service a  maid may do so with propriety.\"    ANSWER: This is solely for service such as is performed by any other class  of servants, be they young or old, in exchange for wages; such a maiden is  free to choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth, for it is  forbidden either that women should be purchased, or that a man should have  more wives than two.    31. QUESTION: Concerning the sacred verse: \"The Lord hath prohibited ...  the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced  a woman.\"    ANSWER: The reference is to the law which previously made it necessary for  another man to marry such a woman before she could again be wedded to her  former husband; this practice hath been prohibited in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.    32. QUESTION: Concerning the restoration and preservation of the two  Houses in the Twin Spots, and the other sites wherein the throne hath been  established.    ANSWER: By the two Houses is intended the Most Great House and the House  of the Primal Point. As for other sites, the people of the areas where  these are situated may choose to preserve either each house wherein the  throne hath been established, or one of them.    33. QUESTION: Again inquiry hath been made about the inheritance of the  teacher.    ANSWER: If the teacher is not of the people of Baha, he doth not inherit.  Should there be several teachers, the share is to be divided equally  amongst them. If the teacher is deceased, his offspring do not inherit his  share, but rather two thirds of it revert to the children of the owner of  the estate, and the remaining one third to the House of Justice.    34. QUESTION: Concerning the residence which hath been assigned  exclusively to the male offspring.    ANSWER: If there are several residences, the finest and noblest of these  dwellings is the one intended, the remainder being distributed amongst the  whole body of the heirs like any other form of property. Any heir, from  whichever category of inheritors, who is outside the Faith of God is  accounted as non-existent and doth not inherit.    35. QUESTION: Concerning Naw-Ruz.    ANSWER: The Festival of Naw-Ruz falleth on the day that the sun entereth  the sign of Aries,(16) even should this occur no more than one minute  before sunset.    36. QUESTION: If the anniversary either of the Twin Birthdays or of the  Declaration of the Bab occurreth during the Fast, what is to be done?    ANSWER: Should the feasts celebrating the Twin Birthdays or the  Declaration of the Bab fall within the month of fasting, the command to  fast shall not apply on that day.    37. QUESTION: In the holy ordinances governing inheritance, the residence  and personal clothing of the deceased have been allotted to the male  offspring. Doth this provision refer only to the father's property, or  doth it apply to the mother's as well?    ANSWER: The used clothing of the mother should be divided in equal shares  among the daughters, but the remainder of her estate, including property,  jewellery, and unused clothing, is to be distributed, in the manner  revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, to all her heirs. If, however, the deceased  hath left no daughters, her estate in its entirety must be divided in the  manner designated for men in the holy Text.    38. QUESTION: Concerning divorce, which must be preceded by a year of  patience: if only one of the parties is inclined toward conciliation, what  is to be done?    ANSWER:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#20)"],[1,"to batter down the walls  of Delhi; that the required amount of carriage could not be provided  in less than sixteen or twenty days; and that the three Native corps  at Umballa could not be depended upon. He asked Sir John whether he  considered 'it would be prudent to risk the small European force we  have here in an enterprise against Delhi,' and he wrote: 'My own view  of the state of things now is, by carefully collecting our resources,  having got rid of the bad materials which we cannot trust, and having  supplied their places with others of a better sort, it would not be  very long before we could proceed, without a chance of failure, in  whatever direction we might please.' Adding, 'this is now the opinion  of all here whom I have consulted--the Major-General and Brigadier,  the Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General and Commissary-General.'  Anson concluded his letter with the following words: 'It would give me  great satisfaction to have your views upon the present crisis, for I  would trust to them more than to my experience.'    John Lawrence, who was straining every nerve to check the Mutiny and  prevent a general rising of the population, was impatient at the idea  of delay, and lost no time in giving Anson his opinion. He telegraphed  it briefly on the 20th, and the following day he wrote to the effect  that he knew Delhi well, having been stationed there for nearly  thirteen years, and it seemed incredible to him that mutineers could  hold and defend it; his belief was 'that, with good management on the  part of the civil officers, it would open its gates on the approach of  our troops.' He admitted that 'on military principles, in the present  state of affairs, it may not be expedient to advance on Delhi until  the Meerut force is prepared to act.' But he protested against  European soldiers being 'cooped up in their cantonments, tamely  awaiting the progress of events.' He went on to say: 'Pray only  reflect on the whole history of India. Where have we failed when  we acted vigorously? Where have we succeeded when guided by timid  counsels? Clive with 1,200 men fought at Plassy, in opposition to  the advice of his leading officers, beat 40,000 men, and conquered  Bengal.'    That Sir John Lawrence greatly under-estimated the difficulties which  Anson had to overcome we now know. Delhi did not open its gates on our  approach, but for more than three months defied all our efforts to  capture it. And in his eagerness to get the Commander-in-Chief  to think as he did, the resolute Chief Commissioner forgot that  Clive--not with 1,200 men, but with 3,000 disciplined troops--had to  deal in the open field with an enemy little better than a rabble;  whereas Anson had to attack a strong fortress, amply supplied with  stores and ammunition, possessing a powerful armament, and held  by soldiers who were not only well trained and equipped, but were  fighting for their lives, and animated by religious fanaticism.    Still, there can be no doubt that John Lawrence's views as to the  necessity for Delhi being taken at all hazards were correct. The  Governor-General held the same opinion, and strongly urged it upon  Anson, who loyally responded, and during the short time he remained at  Umballa strenuously exerted himself to equip the troops destined for  the arduous task.    While preparing for his advance on the Moghul capital, Anson did not  neglect to provide, as far as lay in his power, for the safety of  Umballa. The soldiers' wives and children were sent to Kasauli; a  place of refuge was made for the non-combatants at the church, round  which an entrenchment was thrown; a garrison, about 500 strong, was  formed of the sick and weakly men of the several European regiments,  assisted by some of the Patiala troops; and as an additional security  half the Native corps were sent into the district, and the other half  with the column to Delhi.    John Lawrence had strongly advocated the policy of trusting the  Maharaja of Patiala and the Rajas of Jhind and Nabha. The attitude of  these Chiefs was of extreme importance, for if they had not been well  disposed towards us, our communication with the Punjab would have been  imperilled. There was therefore much anxiety at Umballa as to the  course Patiala, Jhind, and Nabha (the three principal members of  the great Phulkian family) would elect to take. Douglas Forsyth,[9]  Deputy-Commissioner of Umballa, who was a personal friend of the  Maharaja of Patiala, at once sought an interview with him. He  was beginning to explain to the Maharaja the difficulties of the  situation, when he was interrupted by His Highness, who said he was  aware of all that had happened; on which Forsyth asked if it was  true that emissaries from the King of Delhi had come to Patiala. The  Maharaja pointed to some men seated at a little distance, saying,  'There they are.' Forsyth then asked for a word in private. As soon as  they were alone, he addressed the Maharaja thus: 'Maharaja _sahib_,  answer me one question: Are you for us, or against us?' The Maharaja's  reply was very hearty: 'As long as I live I am yours, but you know  I have enemies in my own country; some of my relations are against  me--my brother for one. What do you want done?' Forsyth then asked the  Maharaja to send some of his troops towards Kurnal to keep open the  Grand Trunk Road. The Maharaja agreed on the understanding that  Europeans should soon be sent to support them--a very necessary  condition, for he knew that his men could only be trusted so long as  there was no doubt of our ultimate success.    Patiala was true to his word, and throughout the Mutiny the Phulkian  Chiefs remained perfectly loyal, and performed the important service  of keeping open communication between Delhi and the Punjab.[10]    On the 19th May General Anson was cheered by hearing from John  Lawrence that the Corps of Guides and four trusty Punjab regiments  were proceeding by forced marches to join him. On the 21st he received  a message from the Governor-General informing him that European troops  were coming from Madras, Bombay, and Ceylon. He also heard of the  arrival of the siege-train at Umballa, and he had the satisfaction of  telegraphing to the Chief Commissioner that the first detachment of  the column destined for Delhi had started.    On the 23rd the Commander-in-Chief communicated his plan of operations  to General Hewitt. It was as follows: Two brigades were to advance  from Umballa, commanded by Brigadier Hallifax of the 75th Foot, and  Colonel Jones of the 60th Rifles; and one brigade from Meerut, under  the command of Brigadier Archdale Wilson. The two former were to be  concentrated at Kurnal by the 30th May, and were then to advance,  under General Anson, so as to arrive opposite Baghput on the 5th June,  at which place they were to be joined by the Meerut brigade, and the  united force was then to proceed to Delhi.    All his arrangements being now completed, Anson left Umballa on the  24th May, and reached Kurnal the following morning. On the 26th he was  struck down by cholera, and in a few hours succumbed to that fatal  disease. His last words expressed a hope that his country would do him  justice, and it is grievous to feel that, in estimating his work and  the difficulties he had to encounter, full justice has not been done  him. Anson has been undeservedly blamed for vacillation and want of  promptitude. He was told to 'make short work of Delhi,' but before  Delhi could be taken more men had perished than his whole force at  that time amounted to. The advice to march upon Delhi was sound, but  had it been rashly followed disaster would have been the inevitable  result. Had the Commander-in-Chief been goaded into advancing without  spare ammunition and siege Artillery, or with an insufficient force,  he must have been annihilated by the overwhelming masses of the  mutineers--those mutineers, who, we shall see later, stoutly opposed  Barnard's greatly augmented force at Badli-ki-Serai, would almost  certainly have repulsed, if not destroyed, a smaller body of troops.    On the death of General Anson the command of the Field Force devolved  on Major-General Sir Henry Barnard.      [Footnote 1: 'I am not so much surprised,' wrote General Anson to Lord  Canning on the 23rd March, 'at their objections to the cartridges,  having seen them. I had no idea they contained, or, rather, are  smeared with, such a quantity of grease, which looks exactly like fat.  After ramming down the ball, the muzzle of the musket is covered  with it. This, however, will, I imagine, not be the case with those  prepared according to the late instructions. But there are now  misgivings about the paper, and I think it so desirable that they  should be assured that no animal grease is used in its manufacture,  that I have ordered a special report to be made to me on that head  from Meerut, and until I receive an answer, and am satisfied that no  objectionable material is used, no firing at the depots by the sepoys  will take place. It would be easy to dismiss the detachments to their  regiments without any practice, on the ground that the hot weather is  so advanced, and that very little progress could be made, but I do not  think that would be admissible. The question, having been raised, must  be settled. It would only be deferred till another year, and I trust  that the measures taken by the Government when the objection was first  made, and the example of the punishment of the 19th Native Infantry  and of the other delinquents of the 70th, now being tried by a General  Court-Martial, will have the effect we desire.'--KAYE, vol. i., p.  558.]    [Footnote 2: Surely those whom God has a mind to destroy, He first  deprives of their senses; for not only were the magazines at Delhi and  Cawnpore allowed to fall into the enemy's hands, but the great arsenal  at Allahabad narrowly escaped the same fate.
