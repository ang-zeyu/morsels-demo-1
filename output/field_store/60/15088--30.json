His voice died away against the walls  and ceiling of the box in which he was shut up, and he felt that the  whole house--drawing-rooms, staircases, and passages--remained deaf to  his appeal.    And yet ... and yet ... Mlle. Levasseur--    \"What does it mean?\" he muttered. \"What can it all mean?\"    And motionless now and silent, he thought once more of the girl's strange  attitude, of her distraught face, of her haggard eyes. And he also began  to wonder what accident had released the mechanism which had hurled the  formidable iron curtain upon him, craftily and ruthlessly.          CHAPTER SIX    THE MAN WITH THE EBONY WALKING-STICK      A group consisting of Deputy Chief Detective Weber, Chief Inspector  Ancenis, Sergeant Mazeroux, three inspectors, and the Neuilly commissary  of police stood outside the gate of No. 8 Boulevard Richard-Wallace.    Mazeroux was watching the Avenue de Madrid, by which Don Luis would have  to come, and began to wonder what had happened; for half an hour had  passed since they telephoned to each other, and Mazeroux could find no  further pretext for delaying the work.    \"It's time to make a move,\" said Weber. \"The housekeeper is making  signals to us from the window: the joker's dressing.\"    \"Why not nab him when he comes out?\" objected Mazeroux. \"We shall capture  him in a moment.\"    \"And if he cuts off by another outlet which we don't know of?\" said the  deputy chief. \"You have to be careful with these beggars. No, let's beard  him in his den. It's more certain.\"    \"Still--\"    \"What's the matter with you, Mazeroux?\" asked the deputy chief, taking  him on one side. \"Don't you see that our men are getting restive? They're  afraid of this sportsman. There's only one way, which is to set them on  him as if he were a wild beast. Besides, the business must be finished by  the time the Prefect comes,\"    \"Is he coming?\"    \"Yes. He wants to see things for himself. The whole affair interests him  enormously. So, forward! Are you ready, men? I'm going to ring.\"    The bell sounded; and the housekeeper at once came and half opened the  gate.    Although the orders were to observe great quiet, so as not to alarm the  enemy too soon, the fear which he inspired was so intense that there  was a general rush; and all the detectives crowded into the courtyard,  ready for the fight. But a window opened and some one cried from the  second floor:    \"What's happening?\"    The deputy chief did not reply. Two detectives, the chief inspector, the  commissary, and himself entered the house, while the others remained in  the courtyard and made any attempt at flight impossible.    The meeting took place on the first floor. The man had come down, fully  dressed, with his hat on his head; and the deputy chief roared:    \"Stop! Hands up! Are you Hubert Lautier?\"    The man seemed disconcerted. Five revolvers were levelled at him. And yet  no sign of fear showed in his face; and he simply said:    \"What do you want, Monsieur? What are you here for?\"    \"We are here in the name of the law, with a warrant for your arrest.\"    \"A warrant for my arrest?\"    \"A warrant for the arrest of Hubert Lautier, residing at 8 Boulevard  Richard-Wallace.\"    \"But it's absurd!\" said the man. \"It's incredible! What does it mean?  What for?\"    They took him by both arms, without his offering the least resistance,  pushed him into a fairly large room containing no furniture but three  rush-bottomed chairs, an armchair, and a table covered with big books.    \"There,\" said the deputy chief. \"Don't stir. If you attempt to move, so  much the worse for you.\"    The man made no protest. While the two detectives held him by the  collar, he seemed to be reflecting, as though he were trying to  understand the secret causes of an arrest for which he was totally  unprepared. He had an intelligent face, a reddish-brown beard, and a  pair of blue-gray eyes which now and again showed a certain hardness of  expression behind his glasses. His broad shoulders and powerful neck  pointed to physical strength.    \"Shall we tie his wrists?\" Mazeroux asked the deputy chief.    \"One second. The Prefect's coming; I can hear him. Have you searched the  man's pockets? Any weapons?\"    \"No.\"    \"No flask, no phial? Nothing suspicious?\"    \"No, nothing.\"    M. Desmalions arrived and, while watching the prisoner's face, talked  in a low voice with the deputy chief and received the particulars of  the arrest.    \"This is good business,\" he said. \"We wanted this. Now that both  accomplices are in custody, they will have to speak; and everything will  be cleared up. So there was no resistance?\"    \"None at all, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"No matter, we will remain on our guard.\"    The prisoner had not uttered a word, but still wore a thoughtful look, as  though trying to understand the inexplicable events of the last few  minutes. Nevertheless, when he realized that the newcomer was none other  than the Prefect of Police, he raised his head and looked at M.  Desmalions, who asked him:    \"It is unnecessary to tell you the cause of your arrest, I presume?\"    He replied, in a deferential tone:    \"Excuse me, Monsieur le Prefet, but I must ask you, on the contrary, to  inform me. I have not the least idea of the reason. Your detectives have  made a grave mistake which a word, no doubt, will be enough to set right.  That word I wish for, I insist upon--\"    The Prefect shrugged his shoulders and said:    \"You are suspected of taking part in the murder of Fauville, the civil  engineer, and his son Edmond.\"    \"Is Hippolyte dead?\"    The cry was spontaneous, almost unconscious; a bewildered cry of dismay  from a man moved to the depths of his being. And his dismay was supremely  strange, his question, trying to make them believe in his ignorance,  supremely unexpected.    \"Is Hippolyte dead?\"    He repeated the question in a hoarse voice, trembling all over as he  spoke.    \"Is Hippolyte dead? What are you saying? Is it possible that he can be  dead? And how? Murdered? Edmond, too?\"    The Prefect once more shrugged his shoulders.    \"The mere fact of your calling M. Fauville by his Christian name shows  that you knew him intimately. And, even if you were not concerned in his  murder, it has been mentioned often enough in the newspapers during the  last fortnight for you to know of it.\"    \"I never read a newspaper, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"What! You mean to tell me--?\"    \"It may sound improbable, but it is quite true. I lead an industrious  life, occupying myself solely with scientific research, in view of a  popular work which I am preparing, and I do not take the least part or  the least interest in outside things. I defy any one to prove that I have  read a newspaper for months and months past. And that is why I am  entitled to say that I did not know of Hippolyte Fauville's murder.\"    \"Still, you knew M. Fauville.\"    \"I used to know him, but we quarrelled.\"    \"For what reason?\"    \"Family affairs.\"    \"Family affairs! Were you related, then?\"    \"Yes. Hippolyte was my cousin.\"    \"Your cousin! M. Fauville was your cousin! But ... but then ... Come, let  us have the rights of the matter. M. Fauville and his wife were the  children of two sisters, Elizabeth and Armande Roussel. Those two sisters  had been brought up with a first cousin called Victor.\"    \"Yes, Victor Sauverand, whose grandfather was a Roussel. Victor Sauverand  married abroad and had two sons. One of them died fifteen years ago; the  other is myself.\"    M. Desmalions gave a start. His excitement was manifest. If that man was  telling the truth, if he was really the son of that Victor whose record  the police had not yet been able to trace, then, owing to this very fact,  since M. Fauville and his son were dead and Mme. Fauville, so to speak,  convicted of murder and forfeiting her rights, they had arrested the  final heir to Cosmo Mornington. But why, in a moment of madness, had he  voluntarily brought this crushing indictment against himself?    He continued:    \"My statements seem to surprise you, Monsieur le Prefet. Perhaps they  throw a light on the mistake of which I am a victim?\"    He expressed himself calmly, with great politeness and in a remarkably  well-bred voice; and he did not for a moment seem to suspect that his  revelations, on the contrary, were justifying the measures taken  against him.    Without replying to the question, the Prefect of Police asked him:    \"So your real name is--\"    \"Gaston Sauverand.\"    \"Why do you call yourself Hubert Lautier?\"    The man had a second of indecision which did not escape so clear-sighted  an observer as M. Desmalions. He swayed from side to side, his eyes  flickered and he said:    \"That does not concern the police; it concerns no one but myself.\"    M. Desmalions smiled:    \"That is a poor argument. Will you use the same when I ask you why you  live in hiding, why you left the Avenue du Roule, where you used to live,  without leaving an address behind you, and why you receive your letters  at the post-office under initials?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur le Prefet, those are matters of a private character, which  affect only my conscience. You have no right to question me about them.\"    \"That is the exact reply which we are constantly receiving at every  moment from your accomplice.\"    \"My accomplice?\"    \"Yes, Mme. Fauville.\"    \"Mme. Fauville!\"    Gaston Sauverand had uttered the same cry as when he heard of the death  of the engineer; and his stupefaction seemed even greater, combined as it  was with an anguish that distorted his features beyond recognition.    \"What?... What?... What do you say? Marie!... No, you don't mean it! It's  not true!\"    M. Desmalions considered it useless to reply, so absurd and childish  was this affectation of knowing nothing about the tragedy on the  Boulevard Suchet.    Gaston Sauverand, beside himself, with his eyes starting from his  head, muttered:    \"Is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"Briefe_,--\"Beethoven, by 'a rich third person,' as the following letter  proves, meant Louis Bonaparte, who, after abdicating the Dutch throne,  lived in Gratz.\"]      102.    TO VARENNA.    MY EXCELLENT V. [VARENNA],--    I received your letter with much pleasure, but with much displeasure the  100 florins allotted to me by our poor convent ladies; in the mean time I  will apply part of this sum to pay the copyists--the surplus and the  accounts for copying shall be sent to these good ladies.    I never accept anything for such a purpose. I thought that perhaps the  _third person_ to whom you alluded might be the Ex-King of Holland, in  which case I should have had no scruples, under my present circumstances,  in accepting a gratuity from him, who has no doubt taken enough from the  Dutch in a less legitimate way; but as it is, I must decline (though in all  friendship) any renewal of this subject.    Let me know whether, were I to come myself to Gratz, I could give a  concert, and what the receipts would probably be; for Vienna, alas! can no  longer continue my place of abode. Perhaps it is now too late? but any  information from you on the point will be very welcome.    The works are being copied, and you shall have them as soon as possible.  You may do just what you please with the Oratorio; where it will be of most  use it will best fulfil my intentions.    I am, with esteem, your obedient    BEETHOVEN.    P.S. Say all that is kind from me to the worthy Ursuline ladies. I rejoice  in being able to serve them.      103.    TO ZMESKALL.    Confounded, invited guest! _Domanowetz!_--not musical Count, but gobbling  Count! dinner Count! supper Count! &c., &c. The Quartet is to be tried over  to-day at ten o'clock or half-past, at Lobkowitz's.[1] His Highness, whose  wits are generally astray, is not yet arrived; so pray join us, if you can  escape from your Chancery jailer. Herzog is to see you to-day. He intends  to take the post of my man-servant; you may agree to give him thirty  florins, with his wife _obbligata_. Firing, light, and morning livery  found. I must have some one who knows how to cook, for if my food continues  as bad as it now is, I shall always be ill. I dine at home to-day, because  I get better wine. If you will only order what you like, I very much wish  you to come to me. You shall have the wine _gratis_, and of far better  quality than what you get at the scoundrelly \"Swan.\"    Your very insignificant    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Reichardt, in his _Vertraute Briefe_, writes: \"The beautiful  quartets and evening concerts for the Archduke Rudolph still continue at  Prince von Lobkowitz's, although the Prince himself is about to join his  battalion in Bohemia.\" Reichardt, Vol. I. p. 182, calls Lobkowitz \"an  indefatigable, insatiable, genuine enthusiast for art.\"]      104.    TO ZMESKALL.    Feb. 25, 1813.    I have been constantly indisposed, dear Zmeskall, since I last saw you; in  the mean time the servant who lived with you before your present one has  applied for my situation. I do not recollect him, but he told me he had  been with you, and that you had nothing to say against him, except that he  did not dress your hair as you wished. I gave him earnest-money, though  only a florin. Supposing you have no other fault to find with the man (and  if so I beg you will candidly mention it), I intend to engage him, for you  know that it is no object with me to have my hair dressed; it would be more  to the purpose if my finances could be dressed, or _re-dressed_. I hope to  get an answer from you to day. If there is no one to open the door to your  servant, let him leave the note in the entrance to the left, and should he  find no one there either, he must give it to the porter's wife below  stairs. May Heaven prosper you in your musical undertakings! Your    BEETHOVEN,    _Miserabilis._      105.    TO ZMESKALL.    Feb. 28, 1813.    Let us leave things as they are for to-day, dear Z., till we meet [and so  on about the servant].    Farewell! Carefully guard the fortresses of the realm, which, as you know,  are no longer virgins, and have already received many a shot.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      106.    TO ZMESKALL.    MOST WORTHY COUNSELLOR, OWNER OF MINES AND LORD OF FASTNESSES IN BURGUNDY  AND BUDA!--    Be so good as to let me know how matters stand, as this afternoon at latest  I shall take advantage of your reply to my question, by giving my servant  warning for this day fortnight. His wages, &c., &c. [The rest relates to  his servant.]      107.    TO ZMESKALL.    April 19, 1813.    MY DEAR ZMESKALL,--    I have been refused the University Hall. I heard this two days since; but  being indisposed yesterday I could not go to see you, nor can I to-day  either. We have no resource now but the Kaernthnerthor Theatre, or the one  \"an der Wien.\" I believe there will only be one concert. If both these  fail, we must then have recourse to the Augarten, in which case we ought  certainly to give two concerts. Reflect on this, my dear friend, and let me  have your opinion. To-morrow the symphonies may perhaps be tried over at  the Archduke's if I am able to go out, of which I will apprise you.    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      108.    TO ZMESKALL.    April 23, 1813.    DEAR Z.,--    All will go right, the Archduke being resolved to take this Prince  _Fizlypuzly_ roundly to task. Let me know if you are to dine at the tavern  to-day, or where? Pray tell me if \"Sentivany\" is properly spelt, as I wish  to write to him at the same time about the Chorus. We must also consult  together what day to choose. By the by, be cautious not to mention the  intercession of the Archduke, for Prince _Fizlypuzly_ is not to be with him  till Sunday, and if that evil-minded creditor had any previous hint of the  affair, he would still try to evade us.    Yours ever,    BEETHOVEN.      109.    TO ZMESKALL.    April 26, 1813.    Lobkowitz will give me a day on the 15th of May, or after that period,  which seems to me scarcely better than none at all; so I am almost disposed  to give up all idea of a concert. But the Almighty will no doubt prevent my  being utterly ruined.    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.      110.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Baden, May 27, 1813.    I have the honor to inform you of my arrival in Baden, which is indeed  still very empty of human beings, but with all the greater luxuriance and  full lustre does Nature shine in her enchanting loveliness. Where I fail,  or ever have failed, be graciously indulgent towards me, for so many trying  occurrences, succeeding each other so closely, have really almost  bewildered me; still I am convinced that the resplendent beauties of Nature  here, and the charming environs, will gradually restore my spirits, and a  double share of tranquillity be my portion, as by my stay here I likewise  fulfil the wishes of Y.R.H. Would that my desire soon to hear that Y.R.H.  is fully restored were equally fulfilled! This is indeed my warmest wish,  and how much I grieve that I cannot at this moment contribute to your  recovery by means of _my_ art! This is reserved for the goddess Hygeia  alone, and I, alas! am only a poor mortal, who commends himself to Y.R.H.,  and sincerely hopes soon to be permitted to wait on you.    [K.]      111.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Vienna, July 24, 1813.    From day to day I have been expecting to return to Baden; in the mean time,  the discords that detain me here may possibly be resolved by the end of the  ensuing week. To me a residence in a town during the summer is misery, and  when I also remember that I am thus prevented waiting on Y.R.H., it is  still more vexatious and annoying. It is, in fact, the Lobkowitz and Kinsky  affairs that keep me here. Instead of pondering over a number of bars, I am  obliged constantly to reflect on the number of peregrinations I am forced  to make; but for this, I could scarcely endure to the end. Y.R.H. has no  doubt heard of Lobkowitz's misfortunes,[1] which are much to be regretted;  but after all, to be rich is no such great happiness! It is said that Count  Fries alone paid 1900 gold ducats to Duport, for which he had the security  of the ancient Lobkowitz house. The details are beyond all belief. I hear  that Count Rasumowsky[2] intends to go to Baden, and to take his Quartet  with him, which is really very pretty, and I have no doubt that Y.R.H. will  be much pleased with it. I know no more charming enjoyment in the country  than quartet music. I beg Y.R.H. will accept my heartfelt wishes for your  health, and also compassionate me for being obliged to pass my time here  under such disagreeable circumstances. But I will strive to compensate  twofold in Baden for what you have lost.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: Prince Lobkowitz's \"misfortunes\" probably refer to the great  pecuniary difficulties which befell this music and pomp loving Prince  several years before his death. Beethoven seems to have made various  attempts to induce the Prince to continue the payment of his share of the  salary agreed on, though these efforts were long fruitless. The subject,  however, appears to have been again renewed in 1816, for on the 8th of  March in this year Beethoven writes to Ries to say that his salary consists  of 3400 florins E.S., and this sum he received till his death.]    [Footnote 2: Those who played in Count Rasumowsky's Quartets, to whom  Beethoven dedicated various compositions, were the _virtuosi_ Schuppanzigh  (1st), Sina (2d violin), Linke (violoncello), Weiss (violin).]      112.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1813.[1]    I beg to inquire whether, being in some degree restored, I am to wait on  you this evening? I at the same time take the liberty to make a humble  request. I was in hopes that by this time, at all events, my melancholy  circumstances would have brightened, but all continues in its old state, so  I must determine on giving two concerts.[2] I find that I am compelled "]]]
