It is made of light  brown Java canvas, and embroidered in point Russe with green filoselle.  It is lined with green silk, and slightly quilted. The soles are of  cork. The slipper is trimmed all round with a ruche of green silk ribbon  three-fifths of an inch wide, pleated in double box pleats. The heel is  turned down inside. No. 209 shows the pattern of the point Russe stitch  nearly full size.

Materials: Coloured filoselle, cloth, velvet, cashmere, or silk.    These medallions can be alternated for ornamenting small covers,  cushions, borders, &c. They are worked with coloured filoselle in point  Russe, herring-bone stitch, coral stitch, and knotted stitch, on cloth,  velvet, cashmere, or silk. The middle oval of both medallions contrasts  with the colour of the ground, and must therefore be worked in applique  on the latter with herring-bone stitch, before working the outer border.  The wreath on No. 211 is worked in coral stitch; the knots, which  imitate small blossoms, in knotted stitch. The choice of colours is left  to the personal taste of the worker.

Materials: French lawn or cambric; fine black silk.    This butterfly is worked in the finest black silk procurable, in order  more closely to imitate etching. It is worked in point Russe and scallop  stitch; the dark shaded scallops are worked in button-hole scallop  stitch, the stitches being taken very closely together, but not raised  by the usual method of placing chain stitches beneath the button-hole  stitches. The outlines and flowers are worked in point Russe, the dot in  knotted stitch (see No. 73, _Embroidery Instructions_.)    [Illustration: 212.--Butterfly for Handkerchief Corner.]    The initials are embroidered in raised slanting overcast stitch, and  should be worked with great regularity.           *       *       *       *       *    213 _to_ 215.--_Pattern for a Couvrette in Applique_. (_see pages  576-7_.)    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s embroidery cotton Nos. 24 and  30; cambric muslin; Brussels net; flesh-coloured silk; sewing silk of  the same shade; 1 skein of a darker shade; blue silk; brown silk; gold  thread.    This style of work is most effective for couvrettes or bed covers. It is  worked in cambric muslin and silk, over Brussels net.    The arabesque patterns are worked in cambric muslin, the outlines are  embroidered in overcast, and the material is cut away all round. The  medallions are made of blue silk; the figures upon them are cut out of  flesh-coloured silk, and are gummed first upon tissue-paper, then upon  the blue silk; the figures are further fastened upon the medallions in  overcast stitch with fine silk of a rather darker shade of flesh-colour.  The scarfs are cut out of bright rose-coloured silk; the quiver and  arrows and all the other attributes are worked in gold thread; the hair  in fine brown silk. The edge of the blue silk medallions is worked round  in button-hole stitch, but so as to be easily unripped when the  couvrette has to be cleaned. A border in open ladder stitch is worked  round them (see No. 81, _Embroidery Instructions_). The openings in the  centre pattern are also filled in with lace stitches.           *       *       *       *       *          CROCHET        INSTRUCTIONS.    [Illustration: A Crochet-Needle]    Cotton or thread, wool or silk, with a crochet-needle, are the materials  required for working crochet. The needle, whether it be steel or bone,  must be smoothly polished. The long wooden and bone crochet-needles are  used for wool; for cotton and silk work short steel needles screwed into  a bone handle are best. The beauty of the crochet-work depends upon the  regularity of the stitches, as is the case with every other style of  needlework. The stitches must be elastic, but if too loose they look as  bad as if too tight. The size of the needle and that of the cotton or  wool must correspond; work only with the point of the needle, and never  move the stitch up and down the needle. The cotton with which you work  must be of the very best quality; for borders, insertions, rosettes,  imitation of guipure, use Evans's crochet cotton; for couvrettes,  counterpanes, covers, &c., use knitting-cotton. All crochet-work  patterns are begun on a foundation chain; there are three kinds of  foundation chains--the plain foundation, the double foundation, and the  purl foundation chain.    The plain foundation chain consists of chain stitches.    [Illustration: 216.--Plain Foundation Chain.]    ILLUSTRATION 216.--Form a loop with the cotton or other material with  which you work, take it on the needle, and hold the cotton as for  knitting on the forefinger and other fingers of the left hand. The  crochet-needle is held in the right hand between the thumb and  forefinger, as you hold a pen in writing; hold the end of the cotton of  the loop between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, wind the  cotton once round the needle by drawing the needle underneath the cotton  from left to right, catch the cotton with the hook of the needle and  draw it as a loop through the loop already on the needle, which is cast  off the needle by this means and forms one chain stitch. The drawing the  cotton through the loop is repeated until the foundation chain has  acquired sufficient length. When enough chain stitches have been made,  take the foundation chain between the thumb and forefinger of the left  hand, so that these fingers are always close to and under the hook of  the needle. Each stitch must be loose enough to let the hook of the  needle pass easily through. All foundation chains are begun with a loop.      [Illustration: 217.--Double Foundation Chain.]    ILLUSTRATION 217 (_The Double Foundation Chain_).--Crochet 2 chain  stitches, insert the needle downwards into the left side of the 1st  chain stitch, throw the cotton forward, draw it out as a loop, wind the  cotton again round the needle and draw it through the two loops on the  needle, * draw the cotton as a loop through the left side of the last  stitch (see illustration), wind the cotton round the needle, and draw it  through both loops on the needle. Repeat from * till the foundation  chain is long enough.      [Illustration: 218.--Purl Foundation Chain.]    ILLUSTRATION 218 (_Purl Foundation Chain_).--* Crochet 4 chain stitch,  then 1 treble stitch--that is, wind the cotton round the needle, insert  the needle downwards into the left side of the 1st of the 4 chain  stitches, wind the cotton round the needle, draw it through the stitch,  wind the cotton again round the needle, and at the same time draw the  cotton through the last loop and through the stitch formed by winding  the cotton round the needle. Wind the cotton once more round the needle,  and draw it through the 2 remaining loops on the needle. The 4 chain  stitches form a kind of scallop or purl. Repeat from *. The following  crochet stitches require foundation chains like Nos. 216 and 217; they  are all worked in separate rows excepting the two Nos. 222 and 234. Make  a loop at the beginning of every row, as has been described (No. 216),  and take it on the needle.      [Illustration: 219.--Slip Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 219 (_Slip Stitch_).--Draw the needle through the back part  of a foundation chain stitch, or in the course of the work through the  back part of a stitch of the preceding row, wind the cotton round the  needle, and draw it through the stitch and loop on the needle. The  illustration shows a number of slip stitches, the last of which is left  quite loose; the arrow marks the place where the needle is to be  inserted for the next stitch.      [Illustration: 220.--Double Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 220 (_Double Stitch_).--These are worked nearly like the  preceding ones. Draw the cotton as a loop through the back part of a  stitch, wind the cotton round the needle, and draw it through the two  loops on the needle.      [Illustration: 221.--Double Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 221.--These double stitches are worked nearly like the  preceding ones; the 1st row is worked like that of No. 220; in the  following ones insert the needle into the two upper sides of a stitch of  the preceding row.      [Illustration: 222.--Ribbed Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 222 (_The Ribbed Stitch_).--This stitch is worked backwards  and forwards--that is, the right and wrong sides are worked together,  which forms the raised ribs. Insert the needle always into the back part  of every stitch. Work 1 chain stitch at the end of every row, which is  not worked, however, in the following row.      [Illustration: 223.--Slanting Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 223 (_Slanting Stitch, double stitch_).--This stitch is  worked like that described in No. 220; the cotton is not wound round the  needle the first time in the usual manner, but the needle is placed in  the direction of the arrow, above the cotton. Draw the cotton through as  a loop; the stitch is finished like the common double stitch.      [Illustration: 224.--Cross Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 224 (_Cross Stitch_).--This stitch is worked like No. 223  on a foundation like No. 217, only insert the needle through the two  upper sides of a stitch.

[Illustration 226.--Treble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15154"],[0,"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (#20)"],[1," two cases mentioned, for instance, telegraphing and typewriting,  the chief factor seems the same, as in both cases the aim is to make  the quickest possible finger movements for purposes of signals; and  yet it is not surprising that the development of the ability from the  beginnings to the highest mastery is rather unlike, as all the  movements in telegraphing are performed with the same finger, while  in typewriting the chief trait is the organization of groups from the  impulses to all ten fingers. At least it is certain that learning  always means far more than a mere facilitation of the movement by  mechanical repetition, and this is true of the simplest handling of  the tools in the workshop, of the movements at the machine in the  factory, and of the most complex performances at the subtlest  instruments. The chief factor in the development is always the  organization of the impulses by which the reactions which are at first  complicated become simplified, later mechanized, and finally  synthesized into a higher group which becomes subordinated to one  simple psychical impulse. The most reliable and psychophysically most  economic means for this organization will have to be studied in the  economic psychological laboratories of the future for every particular  technique. Then only can the enormous waste of psychical energy  resulting from haphazard methods be brought to an end.    A problem which is still too little considered in industrial life is  the mutual interference of acquired technical activities. If one  connected series of movements is well trained by practice, does it  become less firmly fixed, if another series is studied in which the  same beginning is connected with another path of discharge? I  approached this psychophysical question of learning by experiments  which I carried on for a long while with variations of ordinary habits  of daily life, asking whether a habit associated with a certain  sensory stimulus can function automatically while dispositions for a  different habit, previously acquired, remain in the psychophysical  system. For instance, I was accustomed to carry my watch in my  left-hand vest pocket. For a week I carried it in the right-hand  pocket of my trousers and recorded every case in which I first  automatically made the movement to the vest. After some time the  movement to the right-hand pocket became entirely automatic. When it  was sufficiently fixed, I again put the watch in the left-hand vest  pocket and recorded how often I unconsciously grasped at the right  side when I wanted to see what time it was. As soon as the vest pocket  movement had again become fixed, I went back to the right-hand  trousers pocket. And so I alternated for a long while, always changing  only after reaching complete automatism. But the results in this case  and in other similar experiments which I carried on showed that the  new automatic connection did not extinguish the after effects of the  previous habit. With every new change the number of wrong movements  became smaller and smaller, and finally a point was reached at which  the dispositions for both movements were equally developed so that no  wrong movements occurred when the watch was put into the new  position.[22]    This problem has been followed up very recently in a valuable  investigation at Columbia University,[23] in which various habits of  typewriting and of card-sorting were acquired and studied in their  mutual interference. These very careful experiments also show that  when two opposing associations are alternately practiced, they have an  interference effect on each other, but that the interference grows  less and less as the practice effect becomes greater. The interference  effect is gradually overcome and both opposing associations become  automatic, so that either of them can be called up independently  without the appearance of the other. Many details of the research  suggest that this whole group of interference problems deserves the  most careful attention by those who would practically profit from  increased industrial efficiency.    Finally, in the experimental study of the problem of technical  learning, we cannot ignore the many side influences which may hasten  or delay, improve or disturb, the acquisition of industrial skill. In  the Harvard laboratory, for instance, we are at present engaged in an  investigation which deals with the influence of feelings on the  rapidity with which new movement cooerdinations are mastered.[24] In  order to have unlimited comparable material a very simple technical  performance is required, namely, the distribution of the 52  playing-cards into 52 boxes. Labels on the boxes indicate changing  combinations for the distribution to be learned. We examine, on the  one side, the influence of feelings of comfort or of discomfort on the  learning of the new habit, these feeling states being produced by  external conditions, such as pleasant or unpleasant sounds, odors, and  so on. On the other side we trace the effects of those feelings which  arise during the learning process itself, such as feelings of  satisfaction with progress, or disappointment, or discomfort, or  disgust or joy in the activity.          XIV    THE ADJUSTMENT OF TECHNICAL TO PSYCHICAL CONDITIONS      Teaching and learning represent only the preliminary problem. The  fundamental question remains, after all, how the work is to be done by  those who have learned it in accordance with the customs of the  economic surroundings and who are accordingly already educated and  trained for it. What can be done to eliminate everything which  diminishes and decreases efficiency, and what remains to be done to  reinforce it. Such influences are evidently exerted by the external  technical conditions, by variations of the activity itself, and by the  play of the psychical motives and counter-motives. It must seem as if  only this last factor would belong in the realm of psychology, but the  technical conditions, of which the machine itself is the most  important part, and the bodily movements also have manifold relations  to the psychical life. Only as far as these relations prevail has the  psychologist any reason to study the problem. The purely physical and  economic factors of technique do not interest him at all, but when a  technical arrangement makes a psychophysical achievement more  difficult or more easy, it belongs in the sphere of the psychologist,  and just this aspect of the work may become of greatest importance for  the total result. In all three of these directions, that is, with  reference to the technical, to the physiological, and to the purely  psychical, the scientific management movement has prepared the way.  The engineers of scientific management recognized, at least, that no  part of the industrial process is indifferent, even the apparently  most trivial activity, the slightest movement of arm or hand or leg,  became the object of their exact measurement. The stopwatch which  measures every movement in fractions of a second has become the symbol  of this new economic period. As long as special psychological  experiments in the service of industrial psychology are still so  exceptional, it may, indeed, be acknowledged that the practical  experiments in the service of scientific management have come nearest  to the solution of these special psychotechnical problems.    To proceed from without toward the centre, we may begin our review  with the physical technique of the working conditions and its  relations to the mind. Tue history of technique shows on every page  this practical adjustment of external labor conditions to the  psychophysical necessities and psychophysical demands. No machine  with which a human being is to work can survive in the struggle for  technical existence, unless it is to a certain degree adapted to the  human nerve and muscle system and to man's possibilities of  perception, of attention, of memory, of feeling, and of will.  Industrial technique with its restless improvements has always been  subordinated to this postulate. Every change which made it possible  for the workingman to secure equal effects with smaller effort or to  secure greater or better effects with equal effort counted as an  economic gain, which was welcome to the market. For instance,  throughout the history of industry we find the fundamental tendency to  transpose all activities from the great muscles to the small muscles.  Any activity which is performed with the robust muscles of the  shoulder when it can be done with the lower arm, or labor which is  demanded from the muscles of the lower arm when it can just as well be  carried out by the fingers, certainly involves a waste of  psychophysical energy. A stronger psychophysical excitement is  necessary in order to secure the innervation of the big muscles in the  central nervous system. This difference in the stimulation of the  various muscle groups has been of significant consequence for the  differentiation of work throughout the development of mankind.[25]  Labor with the large muscles has, for these psychophysical reasons,  never been easily combined with the subtler training of the finer  muscles. Hence a social organization which obliged the men to give  their energy to war and the hunt, both, in primitive life, functions  of the strongest muscles, made it necessary for the domestic  activities, which are essentially functions of the small muscles, to  be carried out by women. The whole history of the machine demonstrates  this economic tendency to make activities dependent upon those muscles  which presuppose the smallest psychophysical effort. It is not only  the smaller effort which gives economic advantage to the stimulation  of the smaller muscles, but the no less important circumstance that  the psychophysical after-effect of their central excitement exerts  less inhibition than the after-effect of the brain"]]]
