Now, Grace, you must prepare a speech, for we ought to have representative  remarks from both classes. Then Anne Pierson must recite 'The Bridge of  Sighs,' after I have made it over to suit the occasion. We'll have to  have some pallbearers. Three girls from each class will do.\"    Julia planned rapidly and well. Grace listened attentively. The junior  captain had remarkable energy. It was easy to see why Julia had always  headed her class. Julia in turn, was equally impressed with Grace's  ability. A mutual admiration society bade fair to spring up between the  two, so recently at swords' points.    On Saturday the weather left nothing to be desired. It seemed like a day  in late spring, although it was in reality early March. At one o'clock  precisely the two classes, with the exception of one member, assembled.  Julia Crosby acting as master of ceremonies, formed the classes in two  lines, and marched them to the middle of the field. Here, to their  complete mystification, they saw a large hole about four feet in depth had  been dug.    \"Who on earth dug that hole, and what is it for?\" inquired a curious  sophomore.    \"Hush!\" said Julia Crosby reverently. \"That is a grave. Be patient. Curb  your rising curiosity. Soon you shall know all.\"    \"Assistant Master Harlowe, will you arrange the esteemed spectators, so  that the ceremony may proceed?\"    Grace stepped forward and solemnly requested the girls to form a double  line on each side of the opening. The shorter girls were placed in the  front rows.    \"The sophomores will now sing their class song,\" directed the master of  ceremonies.    When the sophomores had finished, the juniors applauded vigorously. The  juniors' song was next in order and the sophomores graciously returned the  applause.    \"I will now request the worthy junior members Olive Craig, Anne Green and  Elsie Todd, to advance. Honorable Assistant Master Harlowe, will you name  your trusted followers?\"    Grace named Nora, Jessica and Marian Barber who came to her side with  alacrity.    \"During the brief space of time that we are obliged to absent ourselves,  will every guest keep her roving eyes bent reverently on the ground and  think about nothing. It is well to fittingly prepare for what is to come.\"    With this Julia marched her adherents down the field and around the corner  of the Omnibus House. She was followed by Grace and her band. There was a  chorus of giggles from the chosen helpers that was sternly checked by  Julia.    Before their eyes stood a large, open paste-board box lined with the  colors of both classes, in which reposed the Crosby hatchet, likened to a  battle-ax by Julia. Its handle was decorated with sophomore and junior  ribbons, and around the head was a wreath of immortelles. A disreputable  looking sheaf of wheat lay across the end of the box.    There was a smothered laugh from Nora, whose quick brain had grasped the  full significance of the thing.    \"This is not an occasion for levity,\" reprimanded Grace sternly. \"Laughing  will not be tolerated.\"    Three twisted ribbon handles of sophomore colors and three of junior  ornamented either side of the box. Each girl grasped a handle.    \"We will proceed with the ceremony,\" directed Julia. \"Lift up the box.\"    This was easier said than done. The handles were so close together that  the girls hardly had room to step. The journey was finally accomplished  without any further mishap than the sliding off of the wheat sheaf. This  was hastily replaced by Jessica before its fall had been marked by the  eagle eye of the master of ceremonies, who marched ahead with her  assistant.    When the box had been carefully deposited at one side of the \"grave,\"  Julia Crosby took her place beside it, and assuming a Daniel Webster  attitude began her address.    \"Honored juniors and sophomores. We have met together to-day for a great  and noble purpose. We are about to take a step which will forever after  be recorded among the doughty deeds of Oakdale High School. It will go  down in High School history as the glorious inspiration of a master mind.  We are going to unfurl the banner of peace and bury the hatchet.    \"Since the early days of our class history, war, cruel war, has raged  between the august bodies represented here to-day. On this very field many  moons ago the gallant sophomores advanced upon the, then, very fresh  freshmen, but retreated in wild confusion. It is therefore fitting that  this should be the place chosen for the burial of all grudges, jealousies  and unworthy emotions that formerly rent our breasts.\"    Here Julia paused to take breath.    The girls cheered wildly.    Julia bowed right and left, her hand over her heart. When the noise had  subsided, she continued. She bewailed junior misdeeds and professed meek  repentance. She dwelt upon the beauty of peace and she begged her hearers  henceforth to live with each other amicably.    It was a capital address, delivered in a mock-serious manner that provoked  mirth, and did more toward establishing general good feeling than any  other method she might have tried. In closing she said:    \"The hatchet is the symbol of war. The wheat-sheaf represents our elderly  grudge; but the immortelles are the everlasting flowers of good will that  spring from the planting of these two. We will now listen to a few remarks  from the pride of the sophomore class, Assistant Master of Ceremonies  Grace Harlowe.\"    Grace attempted to speak, but received an ovation that made her flush and  laughingly put her hands over her ears. When she was finally allowed to  proceed, she delivered an oration as flowery as that of the master of  ceremonies.    When the cries of approbation evoked by Grace's oration had died away, it  was announced that the \"renowned elocutionist,\" Miss Anne Pierson, would  recite a poem appropriate to the occasion. Anne accordingly recited \"The  Bridge of Sighs,\" done over by Julia Crosby, and beginning:        \"Take it up gingerly;        Handle with care;      'Tis a relic of sophomore        And junior warfare.\"    The intense feeling with which Anne rendered this touching effusion,  caused the master of ceremonies to sob audibly and lean so heavily upon  her assistant for support that that dignified person almost pitched head  first into the opening, and was saved from an ignominious tumble by one of  her attendants. This was too much for the others, who, forgetting the  solemnity of their office, shrieked with mirth, in which the spectators  were not slow to join.    \"I think we had better wind up the ceremony,\" said Julia with great  dignity. \"These people will soon be beyond our control.\"    The attendants managed to straighten their faces long enough to assist in  the concluding rites that were somewhat hastily performed, and the master  of ceremonies and her assistants held an impromptu reception on the spot.    \"Now,\" said Julia Crosby, \"we have done a good day's work for both  classes. I only hope that no prying freshmen hear of this. They will be  sure to come here and dig up what we have gone to such pains to bury. They  have no respect for their superiors. However, you have all behaved  yourselves with true High School spirit, and I wish to announce that you  will find a spread awaiting you around the corner of the Omnibus House.\"    There was a general hurrah at this statement, and the guests rushed off to  the spot designated.    Grace had held an earnest conference with old Jean, and the result showed  itself in the row of tables rudely constructed to fit the emergency. He  it was who had dug the \"grave.\" He now sat on the steps waiting to build a  fire, over which Grace had planned to make coffee for the hungry girls  whose appetites had been whetted by the fresh air.    The money contributed by the classes had been used to good advantage by  Grace and Julia, and piles of tempting eatables gladdened the eyes of the  guests.    For the next half hour feasting was in order. Juniors and sophomores  shared cups; as the supply of these were limited. At the end of that time  the last crumb of food had disappeared and the girls stood in groups or  walked about the field, discussing the various features of school life.    Some one proposed playing old-fashioned games, and soon \"puss in the  corner,\" \"pom-pom-pull-away,\" and \"prisoner's goal\" were in full swing.    \"This brings back one's Grammar School days, doesn't it?\" said Nora to  Grace. They were deep in a game of prisoner's goal, and stood for a moment  waiting for the enemy to move toward them.    \"I haven't had such a good, wholesale romp for ages,\" answered Grace, and  was off like the wind to intercept Eva Allen as she endeavored to make a  wide detour of their goal.    The hours slipped by on wings.    The start home was made about five o'clock. The juniors and sophomores  trooped back to Oakdale arm in arm, singing school songs and making the  welkin ring with their joyous laughter.    The people of Oakdale smiled at the procession of happy girls and wondered  what particular celebration was in order.    When the center of town was reached the party broke up with a great deal  of laughing and chattering, the girls going their separate ways in the  best of spirits.    \"I've had a perfectly fine time,\" declared Grace, as she said good-bye to  her chums, \"and how glad I am that we are all friends again.\"    She quite forgot when she made that statement that Miriam Nesbit had not  honored the reunion with her presence.          CHAPTER XVIII    AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR      One more excitement was to quicken the pulses of the sophomores before  they settled down to that long last period of study between Easter  holidays and vacation.    The great, decisive basketball game with the juniors was now to take  place.
