And yet by magic was Brunhilda won,    And magic arts must finish now the task.    Then do it! Must I kneel?      SIEGFRIED.      I like it not!    Who would have dreamed of this! And yet it lay    So very near! O nature three times blest!    In all my life no deed I've shunned like this;    Yet what thou say'st is true. So let it be.      GUNTHER.      I'll go and give my mother but a hint--      HAGEN.      No, no! No woman! We're already three    And have, I hope, no tongue to tell the tale.    Let death the fourth one in our compact be!      [_Exeunt omnes._]          ACT III      _Morning. Courtyard of the castle. The cathedral is at one side._          SCENE I      _Enter_ RUMOLT _and_ DANKWART _armed._      RUMOLT.      Three dead!      DANKWART.      For yesterday it was enough,    For that was but the prelude! Now there'll be    Another tale to tell.      RUMOLT.      These Nibelungs    Are e'er prepared for death; they bring their shrouds    And each man wears both shroud and sword at once.      DANKWART.      The customs are so strange in northern lands!    For as the mountains grow more rugged still    And cheerful oaks make way for sombre firs,    Just so does man grow gloomy, till at last    He's wholly lost and but the brute remains!    First comes a race that cannot even sing,    And next another race that cannot laugh,    Then follows one that's dumb, and so it goes.          SCENE II      _Music. A great procession._ WULF _and_ TRUCHS _among the warriors._      RUMOLT (_joining_ DANKWART).      Will Hagen be content?      DANKWART.      I think he will.    This is a summons, as it were, to war!    Yet he is right, for this strange princess needs    Quite other morning serenades than sings    The lark that warbles in the linden tree.      [_They pass by._]          SCENE III      _Enter_ SIEGFRIED _with_ KRIEMHILD.      KRIEMHILD (_calling attention to her attire_).      Wilt thou not thank me?      SIEGFRIED.      Nay, what dost thou mean?      KRIEMHILD.      But look at me!      SIEGFRIED. That thou art living, smiling,    I give thee thanks, and that thine eyes are blue--    I love not black--      KRIEMHILD.      Thou dost but praise the Lord    In his handmaiden! Did I make myself,    Thou simple fellow? Did I choose the eyes    Thou dost admire?      SIEGFRIED.      Yet love, methinks, might dream    E'en such strange fancies! One fair morn in May    When all things glistened as they glisten now,    Two crystal dewdrops, clearer than the rest,    Were hanging on the harebells bluest spray;    And thou hast stolen them, and evermore    All heaven's in thine eyes.      KRIEMHILD.      Then rather give    Thy thanks to me that as a child I fell    So wisely. My blue eyes I might have lost    The day I only marked my temple here!      SIEGFRIED.      Oh, let me kiss the scar!      KRIEMHILD.      Thy healing art    Would be but lost. No balsam craves the wound    That's long since healed. But tell me more!      SIEGFRIED.      I thank    Thy mouth--      KRIEMHILD.      With words?      SIEGFRIED (_about to embrace her_).      But may I thank thee so?      KRIEMHILD (_draws back_).      Dost think that I invite thee?      SIEGFRIED.      With words then    For thy words! No, for sweeter yet than words,    Thy murmuring of tender secret things    My ear finds precious, as my lips thy kiss.    I thank thee for thy secret gazing forth    To see us throwing weights to win the prize.    Oh, had I dreamed of it! And for thy scorn    And mockery--      KRIEMHILD.      A maiden's pride to soothe    For tarrying, thou thinkest? Cruel friend!    I told thee in the dark! But wilt thou see    My blushes now when in the light of day    Thou tellest me the tale? My foolish blood    Flushes and pales so fast, my mother says    That I am like a rose-bush that sends forth    Red buds and white upon a single stem--    Else hadst thou never found my secret out.    For I could feel the burning of my cheeks,    When yestermorn my brother teased me so.    I saw no way but to confess to thee.      SIEGFRIED.      Then may he start the noblest stag today!      KRIEMHILD.      And may he miss him! Yes, I wish it too.--    see thou art just like my uncle, Hagen,    Who, if one lays a garment by his bed,    That one has made in secret, will not heed    Unless perchance it is too tight.      SIEGFRIED.      And why?      KRIEMHILD.      Thou only see'st God's and nature's gifts    In all that's mine, but my own handiwork,    The raiment that adorns me, thou see'st not--    Not even the fair girdle that I wear.      SIEGFRIED.      The girdle's gay, and yet I'd rather wind    About thy waist the rainbow's lovely hue;    Methinks that ye would suit each other well.      KRIEMHILD.      But bring it me at night and I will change,    Yet do not throw it down like this I wear.    'Tis but by chance I did not lose thy gift.      SIEGFRIED.      What sayest thou?      KRIEMHILD.      But for the precious stones,    It might be underneath the table still,    But fire is a thing one cannot hide.      SIEGFRIED.      Is that my gift?      KRIEMHILD.      It is.      SIEGFRIED.      But thou art dreaming!      KRIEMHILD.      I found it in the room.      SIEGFRIED.      It is thy mother's!    She must have let it fall.      KRIEMHILD.      It is not hers!    For well I know her ornaments. I thought    It had been taken from the Niblung's hoard;    To give thee joy I put it on at once.      SIEGFRIED.      I thank thee, but the girdle I know not!      KRIEMHILD (_takes the girdle off_).      Then for my golden girdle make thou room    Which thou concealest! I was all attired,    And only put it on to honor thee,    My mother also, for this golden one    She gave to me.      SIEGFRIED.      But that is very strange!--    'Twas lying on the floor?      KRIEMHILD.      It was.      SIEGFRIED.      And crumpled?      KRIEMHILD.      I see you know it well! The second trick    Succeeded like the first, and now I have    My task twice over!      [_She starts to put the girdle on again._]      SIEGFRIED.      No! For God's sake, no!      KRIEMHILD.      Art thou in earnest?      SIEGFRIED (_to himself_).      'Twas with that she strove    To tie my hands.      KRIEMHILD.      Art laughing?      SIEGFRIED (_to himself_).      Then I raged,    And put forth all my strength.      KRIEMHILD.      Nay, thou art not?      SIEGFRIED (_to himself_).      I snatched at something.      KRIEMHILD.      That I'll soon believe.      SIEGFRIED (_to himself_).      I thrust it, when she grasped for it again,    Into my bosom, and--Now give it me!    No well is deep enough to hide it in;    With a great stone I'll sink it in the Rhine!      KRIEMHILD.      Siegfried!      SIEGFRIED.      I must have lost it--Give it me!      KRIEMHILD.      Where didst thou get this girdle?      SIEGFRIED.      Nay, this is    A dark and fearful secret; thou should'st seek    To learn no whit about it.      KRIEMHILD.      Yet thou hast    Confided one still greater, and I know    The place where Death may strike the fatal blow.      SIEGFRIED.      That I alone protect!      KRIEMHILD.      And there are two    To guard the other!      SIEGFRIED (_to himself_).      I was far too quick.      KRIEMHILD (_covers her face_).      Thou gav'st thy oath to me! Why didst thou that?    I had not even asked it.      SIEGFRIED.      Still I swear,    I ne'er have known a woman!      KRIEMHILD (_holds up the girdle_).      SIEGFRIED.      That was used    To bind me.      KRIEMHILD.      If a lion told the tale    'Twere less incredible!      SIEGFRIED.      And yet 'tis true.      KRIEMHILD.      This hurts me most! To such a man as thou,    The sin itself, however black it be,    Is more becoming than the cloak of lies    Wherewith he fain would hide it.      _Enter_ GUNTHER _and_ BRUNHILDA.      SIEGFRIED.      We must go!    They come!      KRIEMHILD.      But who! Does Brunhild know the girdle?      SIEGFRIED.      Pray hide it quickly!      KRIEMHILD.      No, I'll show it them!      SIEGFRIED.      I pray thee hide it. Then thou shalt know all.      KRIEMHILD (_hiding the girdle_).      So Brunhilda knows the girdle?      SIEGFRIED.      Listen then!      [_Both follow the procession._]          SCENE IV      BRUNHILDA.      Was that not Kriemhild?      GUNTHER.      Yes.      BRUNHILDA.      How long does she    Tarry beside the Rhine?      GUNTHER.      She'll soon depart,    For Siegfried must go home.      BRUNHILDA.      I'll grant him leave,    And willingly dispense with his farewell.      GUNTHER.      But dost thou hate him so?      BRUNHILDA.      I cannot bear    To see thy noble sister sink so low.      GUNTHER.      She does as thou dost.      BRUNHILDA.      Nay, thou art a man!    This name which was of old to me the call    To arms, now fills my heart with joy and pride!    Yes, Gunther, I am wonderfully changed.    Thou see'st it too? There's something I might ask,    But yet I do not!      GUNTHER.      Thou'rt my noble wife!      BRUNHILDA.      'Tis sweet to hear that word, and now it seems    As strange to me that once I used to ride    To battle on my horse and hurl my spear,    As it would seem to see thee turn the spit!    I cannot bear the sight of weapons now,    And my own shield I find too heavy far;    I tried to lay it by, but had to call    My maid. I'd rather watch the spiders spin    And see the little birds that build their nests,    Than go with thee!      GUNTHER.      Yet this time thou must go!      BRUNHILDA.      And I know why. Forgive me! What I thought    Was weakness was but magnanimity,    For thou would'st not disgrace me on the ship    When I defied thee! Naught of that there dwelt    Within my heart, and therefore has the strength    That some caprice of nature gave to me    Departed from me, and returned to thee!      GUNTHER.      Since thou art gentle, then be reconciled    With Siegfried too!      BRUNHILDA.

The weather was cold, but  the stranger who first swam across bore in one hand a piece of burning  wood and a green branch. He was no sooner landed than he converted his  embers into a fire to dry himself. Immediately after him followed a  grey-haired chief (of whom I had heard on the Lachlan) and two others. It  appeared however that Piper did not at first understand their language,  saying it was \"Irish\"; but it happened that there was with this tribe a  native of Cudjallagong (Regent's lake) and it was rather curious to see  him act as interpreter between Piper and the others.    THEIR REPORTS ABOUT THE JUNCTION OF THE DARLING.    We learnt that the Murrumbidgee joined a much larger river named the  Milliwa, a good way lower down, and that these united streams met, at a  still greater distance, the Oolawambiloa, a river from the north which  received a smaller one, bringing with it all the waters of Wamboul (the  Macquarie). These natives proposed to amuse us with a corrobory dance, to  which I did not object, but they postponed it until the following  evening.    SEARCH UP THE RIVER FOR JUNCTION OF THE LACHLAN.    May 13.    Having been very anxious to complete my survey of the Kalare by  determining the true situation of its junction with the Murrumbidgee, I  set out this morning with the intention of tracing this river upwards to  that point, which I thought could not be at a greater distance than ten  or twelve miles. We sought it however in vain, until darkness put a stop  to our progress after we had measured full twenty miles. We lay down by  the riverside and, although entirely without either food or shelter,  determined to prosecute our search at daylight next morning.    COURSE OF THE MURRUMBIDGEE.    May 14.    Having laid down our work on the map last evening (by the light of the  fire) I found that we were to the eastward, not only of our late camp  where we had wanted water, but also even of our last camp on the Lachlan,  and to the southward of it thirteen miles. It thus appeared that the  river had taken a very extraordinary turn to the south or south-east,  probably near our last encampment upon it. After measuring three miles  further this morning, by which I was enabled to intersect a low hill in  the situation where I expected to find the Kalare, and being then on a  bend of the Murrumbidgee whence I could see no other indication of it  save the line of trees some miles off, in which however it no doubt was,  the whole intervening space being covered with Polygonum junceum, I was  content with intersecting the point where that line joined the  Murrumbidgee, chiefly out of consideration for the men who were with me.  It was well that I then determined to return, for one man became so  faint, when within a few miles of the camp, that the two others had to  remain with him until I rode forward to it and sent back the doctor with  something for them to eat.    The course of the Murrumbidgee, as far as I traced it in that excursion,  appeared to be about west, and I distinctly saw, from the highest point I  attained on that river, rising ground at a great distance also bearing  east. Under these circumstances it was obvious that the long course of  the river Lachlan is in no part better defined than where it enters the  basin of the Murrumbidgee. Water, which had been so scarce in other  parts, was abundant where its channel and immediate margins assumed the  reedy character of the greater river. So far from terminating in a lagoon  or uninhabitable marsh, the banks of the Lachlan at fifty miles below the  spot where Mr. Oxley supposed he saw its termination as a river, are  backed on both sides by rising ground, until the course turns finally  southward into the Murrumbidgee.    TRIBE FROM CUDJALLAGONG VISITS THE CAMP IN MY ABSENCE.    On my arrival at the camp I found that six of the party mounted had set  out in search of me at midday. A strong tribe had arrived soon after my  departure and, in conjunction with those natives whom we found there, it  had been molesting the camp during the whole of the night. On first  coming up the men composing it boldly approached the fires and took their  seats, demanding something to eat.    MOVEMENTS OF THE TRIBE.    It appeared that they had followed our cart track downwards, having with  them a native of Cudjallagong. They inquired particularly why Majy had  gone to the junction of the Kalare with so few people; and they gave a  very unfavourable account of the tribe at that place. This alarmed Mr.  Stapylton, and when he observed the tribe set off in the morning, back  along the cart track, he despatched the party on horseback under Burnett  with orders to observe the movements of the tribe, to look for my track  and, if possible, to join me. The party returned to the camp about eight  in the evening, to my great satisfaction, for I had been apprehensive  that they might have proceeded to seek me at the junction and I had  despatched two men to recall them as soon as I returned.    CAUGHT FOLLOWING MY STEPS.    Burnett reported when he returned that he had found our track after  making a considerable circuit five or six miles from the camp; and as  Piper, who accompanied him, was tracing my steps homewards, on perceiving  some natives running along it, he concluded that we were just before them  and sounded the bugle, when they proved to be the tribe before mentioned,  all armed with spears. What their object was I cannot say, for three of  them had been trotting along the footmarks, while the rest of the tribe  in a body kept pace abreast of them. On hearing the bugle it appeared  that they seemed much alarmed and drew up at a distance.    PIPER QUESTIONS THEM.    They would not allow Piper to approach them, but one at length came  forward and informed him that Majy was gone home. Piper was so dubious  about this that he insisted on examining the points of their spears.    During the nights passed at this camp the natives were on the alert, so  that their various movements, cooeys, and calls kept the party in a state  of watchfulness, aware, as experience had taught us, of their thieving  propensities. Some rockets sent up about the time I was expected on the  evening of our absence had however scared them a little; and it is  probable that the man from Cudjallagong had given them new ideas about  soldiers. Piper's watchword, also, when taking up his carabine, usually  was \"Bell gammon soldiers.\"* They left the neighbourhood of our camp on  my return and we saw no more of the tribe which had followed me.    (*Footnote. Meaning Soldiers are no joke!)      CHAPTER 3.4.    The Murrumbidgee compared with other rivers.  Heaps of stones used in cooking.  High reeds on the riverbank.  Lake Weromba.  Native encampment.  Riverbanks of difficult access.  Best horse drowned.  Cross a country subject to inundations.  Traverse a barren region at some distance from the river.  Kangaroos there.  Another horse in the river.  Lagoons preferable to the river for watering cattle.  High wind, dangerous in a camp under trees.  Serious accident; a cartwheel passes over The Widow's child.  Graves of the natives.  Choose a position for the depot.  My horse killed by the kick of a mare.  Proceed to the Darling with a portion of the party.  Reach the Murray.  Its breadth at our camp.  Meet with a tribe.  Lake Benanee.  Discover the natives to be those last seen on the Darling.  Harassing night in their presence.  Piper alarmed.  Rockets fired to scare them away.  They again advance in the morning.  Men advance towards them holding up their firearms.  They retire, and we continue our journey.  Again followed by the natives.  Danger of the party.  Long march through a scrubby country.  Dismal prospect.  Night without water or grass.  Heavy rain.  Again make the Murray.  Strange natives visit the camp at dusk.    THE MURRUMBIDGEE COMPARED WITH OTHER RIVERS.    May 15.    The night had been stormy with rain so that I had not been able to  ascertain the latitude of the point at which we had reached this  important river. It was Sunday and, although the two men sent after  Burnett's party had come in early enough, we remained in the same camp. I  had already been struck with the remarkable dissimilarity between the  Murrumbidgee and all the interior rivers previously seen by me,  especially the Darling. The constant fulness of its stream, its  water-worn and lightly-timbered banks, and the firm and accessible nature  of its immediate margin, unbroken by gullies, were all characters quite  the reverse of those which I had seen elsewhere. Whatever reeds or  polygonum might be outside, a certain space along the river was almost  everywhere clear, probably from its constant occupation by the natives.    HEAPS OF STONES USED IN COOKING.    One artificial feature not observed by me in other places distinguishes  the localities principally frequented by the natives, and consists in the  lofty mounds of burnt clay or ashes used by them in cooking. The common  process of natives in dressing their provisions is to lay the food  between layers of heated stones; but here, where there are no stones, the  calcined clay seems to answer the same purpose, and becomes better or  harder the more it is used. Hence the accumulation of heaps resembling  small hills.* Some of them were so very ancient as to be surrounded by  circles of lofty trees; others, long abandoned, were half worn away by  the river which, in the course of ages, had so far changed its bed that  the burnt ashes reached out to mid-channel; others, now very remote from  the river, had large trees growing out of them.    (*Footnote. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones: and they  took stones, and made a heap, and they did eat there upon the heap.  Genesis 31:46. \"Thevenot describes the"]]]
