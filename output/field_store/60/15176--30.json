We may be thankful that we are following a band of pioneers whose  fearless courage and passion for truth would not let them turn back  even when the trail led through fields hitherto forbidden. The leader  of this band of pioneers was a young doctor named Freud.      THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH    =Early Beginnings.= In 1882, when Freud was the assistant to Dr.  Breuer of Vienna, there was brought to them for treatment a young  woman afflicted with various hysterical pains and paralyses. This  young woman's case marked an epoch in medical history; for out of the  effort to cure her came some surprising discoveries of great  significance to the open-minded young student.    It was found that each of this girl's symptoms was related to some  forgotten experience, and that in every case the forgetting seemed to  be the result of the painfulness of the experience. In other words,  the symptoms were not visitations from without, but expressions from  within; they were a part of the mental life of the patient; they had a  history and a meaning, and the meaning seemed in some way to be  connected with the patient's previous attitude of mind which made the  experience too painful to be tolerated in consciousness. These  previous ideas were largely subconscious and had been acquired during  early childhood. When by means of hypnosis a great mass of forgotten  material was brought to the surface and later made plain to her  consciousness, the symptoms disappeared as if by magic.    =A Startling Discovery.= For a time Breuer and Freud worked together,  finding that their investigations with other patients served to  corroborate their former conclusions. When it became apparent that in  every case the painful experience bore some relation to the love-life  of the patient, both doctors were startled. Along with most of the  rest of the world, they had been taught to look askance at the  reproductive instinct and to shrink from realizing the vital place  which sex holds in human life.    Breuer dropped the work, and after an interval Freud went on alone. He  was resolved to know the truth, and to tell what he saw. When he  reported to the world that out of all his hundreds of patients, he had  been unable, after the most careful analysis, to find one whose  illness did not grow from some lack of adjustment of the sex-life, he  was met by a storm of protest from all quarters. No amount of evidence  seemed to make any difference. People were determined that no such  libel should be heaped on human nature. Sex-urge was not respectable  and nervous people were to be respected.    Despite public disapproval, the scorn of other scientists, and the  resistance of his own inner prejudices, Freud kept on. He was forced  to acknowledge the validity of the facts which invariably presented  themselves to view. Like Luther under equal duress, he cried: \"Here I  stand. I can do no other.\"    =Freudian Principles.= Gradually, as he worked, he gathered together a  number of outstanding facts about man's mental life and about the  psycho-neuroses. These facts he formulated into certain principles,  which may be summed up in the following way.    1 There is no _chance_ in mental life; every mental phenomenon--hence  every nervous phenomenon--has a cause and meaning.    2 Infantile mental life is of tremendous importance in the direction  of adult processes.    3 Much of what is called forgetting is rather a repression into the  subconscious, of impulses which were painful to the personality as a  whole.    4 Mental processes are dynamic, insisting on discharge, either in  reality or in phantasy.    5 An emotion may become detached from the idea to which it belongs and  be displaced on other ideas.    6 Sex-interests dominate much of the mental life where their influence  is unrecognized. The disturbance in a psycho-neurosis is always in  this domain of sex-life. \"In a normal sexual life, no neurosis.\" If a  shock is the precipitating cause of the trouble, it is only because  the ground was already prepared by the sex-disturbance.    Freud was perhaps unfortunate in his choice of the word \"sex,\" which  has so many evil connotations; but as he found no other word to cover  the field, he chose the old one and stretched its meaning to include  all the psychic and physical phenomena which spring directly and  indirectly from the great processes of reproduction and parental care,  and which ultimately include all and more than our word \"love.\"[33]    [Footnote 33: Freud and his followers have always said that they saw  no theoretical reason why any other repressed instinct should not form  the basis of a neurosis, but that, as a matter of fact, they never had  found this to be the case, probably because no other instinct comes  into such bitter and persistent conflict with the dictates of society.  Now, however, the Great War seems to have changed conditions. Under  the strain and danger of life at the front there has developed a kind  of nervous breakdown called shellshock or war-neurosis, which seems in  some cases to be based not on the repression of the instinct of  race-preservation but on the unusual necessity for repression of the  instinct of self-preservation. Army surgeons report that wounded men  almost never suffer from shell-shock. The wound is enough to secure  the unconsciously desired removal to the rear. But in the absence of  wounds, a desire for safety may at the same time be so intense and so  severely repressed that it seizes upon the neurosis as the only  possible means of escape from the unbearable situation. In time of  peace, however, the instinct of reproduction seems to be the only  impulse which is severely enough repressed to be responsible for a  nervous breakdown.]    =Later Developments.= Little by little, the scientific world came to  see that this wild theorizer had facts on his side; that not only had  he formulated a theory, but he had discovered a cure, and that he was  able to free people from obsessions, fears, and physical symptoms  before which other methods were powerless. One by one the open-minded  men of science were converted by the overpowering logic of the  evidence, until to-day we find not only a \"Freudian school,\" counting  among its members many of the eminent scientists of the day, but we  find in medical schools and universities courses based on Freudian  principles, with text-books by acknowledged authorities in medicine  and psychology. We find magazines devoted entirely to psycho-analytic  subjects,[34] besides articles in medical journals and even numerous  articles in popular magazines. Not only is the treatment of nervous  disorders revolutionized by these principles but floods of light are  thrown on such widely different fields of study as ancient myths and  folk lore, the theory of wit, methods of child training, and the  little slips of the tongue and everyday \"breaks\" that have until  recently been considered the meaningless results of chance.    [Footnote 34: _The Psychoanalytic Review_ and the _International  Journal of Psychoanalysis._]    =A Searching Question.= We find, then, that when we ask, \"What makes  people nervous?\" we are really asking: \"What is man like, inside and  out, up and down? What makes him think, feel, and act as he does every  hour of every day?\" We are asking for the source of human motives, the  science of human behavior, the charting of the human mind. It is hard  to-day to understand how so much reproach and ridicule could have been  aroused by the statement that the ultimate cause of nervousness is a  disturbance of the sex-life. There has already been a change in the  public attitude toward things sexual.    Training-courses for mothers and teachers, elementary teaching in the  schools, lectures and magazine articles have done much to show the  fallacy of our old hypersensitive attitude. Since the war, some of us  know, too, with what success the army has used the Freudian principles  in treating war-neurosis, which was mistakenly called shell-shock by  the first observers. We know, too, more about the constitution of  man's mind than the public knew ten years ago. When we remember the  insistent character of the instincts and the repressive method used by  society in restraining the most obstreperous impulse, when we remember  the pain of such conflict and the depressing physical effects of  painful emotions, we cannot wonder that this most sharply repressed  instinct should cause mental and physical trouble.    =What about Sublimation?= On the other hand, it has been stated in  Chapter IV that although this universal urge cannot be repressed, it  can be sublimated or diverted to useful ends which bring happiness,  not disaster, to the individual. We have a right, then, to ask why  this happy issue is not always attained, why sublimation ever fails.  If a psycho-neurosis is caused by a failure of an insistent instinct  to find adequate expression, by a blocking of the libido or the  love-force, what are the conditions which bring about this blocking?  The sex-instinct of every respectable person is subject to restraint.  Some people are able to adjust themselves; why not all? The question,  \"What makes people nervous?\" then turns out to mean: What keeps people  from a satisfactory outlet for their love-instincts? What is it that  holds them back from satisfaction in direct expression, and prevents  indirect outlet in sublimation? Whatever does this must be the real  cause of \"nerves.\"      THE CAUSES OF \"NERVES\"    =Plural, not Singular.= The first thing to learn about the cause is  that it is not a cause at all, but several causes. We are so well made  that it takes a combination of circumstances to upset our equilibrium.  In other words, a neurosis must be \"over-determined.\" Heredity, faulty  education, emotional shock, physical fatigue,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#20)"],[1,"subject. The very  meaning of the word describes the whole thing about which we are  inquiring, both as to its substance and character. For we must  necessarily understand by \"sound\" those whose minds are under no  perturbation from any motion as if it were a disease. They who are  differently affected we must necessarily call \"unsound.\" So that  nothing is better than what is usual in Latin, to say that they who are  run away with by their lust or anger have quitted the command over  themselves; though anger includes lust, for anger is defined to be the  lust of revenge. They, then, who are said not to be masters of  themselves, are said to be so because they are not under the government  of reason, to which is assigned by nature the power over the whole  soul. Why the Greeks should call this mania, I do not easily apprehend;  but we define it much better than they, for we distinguish this madness  (_insania_), which, being allied to folly, is more extensive, from what  we call _furor_, or raving. The Greeks, indeed, would do so too, but  they have no one word that will express it: what we call _furor_, they  call [Greek: melancholia], as if the reason were affected only by a  black bile, and not disturbed as often by a violent rage, or fear, or  grief. Thus we say Athamas, Alcmaeon, Ajax, and Orestes were raving  (_furere_); because a person affected in this manner was not allowed by  the Twelve Tables to have the management of his own affairs; therefore  the words are not, if he is mad (_insanus_), but if he begins to be  raving (_furiosus_). For they looked upon madness to be an unsettled  humor that proceeded from not being of sound mind; yet such a person  might perform his ordinary duties, and discharge the usual and  customary requirements of life: but they considered one that was raving  as afflicted with a total blindness of the mind, which, notwithstanding  it is allowed to be greater than madness, is nevertheless of such a  nature that a wise man may be subject to raving (_furor_), but cannot  possibly be afflicted by insanity (_insania_). But this is another  question: let us now return to our original subject.    VI. I think you said that it was your opinion that a wise man was  liable to grief.    _A._ And so, indeed, I think.    _M._ It is natural enough to think so, for we are not the offspring of  flints; but we have by nature something soft and tender in our souls,  which may be put into a violent motion by grief, as by a storm; nor did  that Crantor, who was one of the most distinguished men that our  Academy has ever produced, say this amiss: \"I am by no means of their  opinion who talk so much in praise of I know not what insensibility,  which neither can exist, nor ought to exist. \"I would choose,\" says he,  \"never to be ill; but should I be so, still I should choose to retain  my sensation, whether there was to be an amputation or any other  separation of anything from my body. For that insensibility cannot be  but at the expense of some unnatural ferocity of mind, or stupor of  body.\" But let us consider whether to talk in this manner be not  allowing that we are weak, and yielding to our softness.  Notwithstanding, let us be hardy enough, not only to lop off every arm  of our miseries, but even to pluck up every fibre of their roots. Yet  still something, perhaps, may be left behind, so deep does folly strike  its roots: but whatever may be left it will be no more than is  necessary. But let us be persuaded of this, that unless the mind be in  a sound state, which philosophy alone can effect, there can be no end  of our miseries. Wherefore, as we began, let us submit ourselves to it  for a cure; we shall be cured if we choose to be. I shall advance  something further. I shall not treat of grief alone, though that indeed  is the principal thing; but, as I originally proposed, of every  perturbation of the mind, as I termed it; disorder, as the Greeks call  it: and first, with your leave, I shall treat it in the manner of the  Stoics, whose method is to reduce their arguments into a very small  space; afterward I shall enlarge more in my own way.    VII. A man of courage is also full of faith. I do not use the word  confident, because, owing to an erroneous custom of speaking, that word  has come to be used in a bad sense, though it is derived from  confiding, which is commendable. But he who is full of faith is  certainly under no fear; for there is an inconsistency between faith  and fear. Now, whoever is subject to grief is subject to fear; for  whatever things we grieve at when present we dread when hanging over us  and approaching. Thus it comes about that grief is inconsistent with  courage: it is very probable, therefore, that whoever is subject to  grief is also liable to fear, and to a broken kind of spirits and  sinking. Now, whenever these befall a man, he is in a servile state,  and must own that he is overpowered; for whoever admits these feelings,  must admit timidity and cowardice. But these cannot enter into the mind  of a man of courage; neither, therefore, can grief: but the man of  courage is the only wise man; therefore grief cannot befall the wise  man. It is, besides, necessary that whoever is brave should be a man of  great soul; that whoever is a man of a great soul should be invincible;  whoever is invincible looks down with contempt on all things here, and  considers them, beneath him. But no one can despise those things on  account of which he may be affected with grief; from whence it follows  that a wise man is never affected with grief: for all wise men are  brave; therefore a wise man is not subject to grief. And as the eye,  when disordered, is not in a good condition for performing its office  properly; and as the other parts, and the whole body itself, when  unsettled, cannot perform their office and business; so the mind, when  disordered, is but ill-fitted to perform its duty. The office of the  mind is to use its reason well; but the mind of a wise man is always in  condition to make the best use of his reason, and therefore is never  out of order. But grief is a disorder of the mind; therefore a wise man  will be always free from it.    VIII. And from these considerations we may get at a very probable  definition of the temperate man, whom the Greeks call [Greek: sophron]:  and they call that virtue [Greek: sophrosynen], which I at one time  call temperance, at another time moderation, and sometimes even  modesty; but I do not know whether that virtue may not be properly  called frugality, which has a more confined meaning with the Greeks;  for they call frugal men [Greek: chresimous], which implies only that  they are useful; but our name has a more extensive meaning: for all  abstinence, all innocency (which the Greeks have no ordinary name for,  though they might use the word [Greek: ablabeia], for innocency is that  disposition of mind which would offend no one) and several other  virtues are comprehended under frugality; but if this quality were of  less importance, and confined in as small a compass as some imagine,  the surname of Piso[36] would not have been in so great esteem. But as  we allow him not the name of a frugal man (_frugi_), who either quits  his post through fear, which is cowardice; or who reserves to his own  use what was privately committed to his keeping, which is injustice; or  who fails in his military undertakings through rashness, which is  folly--for that reason the word frugality takes in these three virtues  of fortitude, justice, and prudence, though it is indeed common to all  virtues, for they are all connected and knit together. Let us allow,  then, frugality itself to be another and fourth virtue; for its  peculiar property seems to be, to govern and appease all tendencies to  too eager a desire after anything, to restrain lust, and to preserve a  decent steadiness in everything. The vice in contrast to this is called  prodigality (_nequitia_). Frugality, I imagine, is derived from the  word _fruge_, the best thing which the earth produces; _nequitia_ is  derived (though this is perhaps rather more strained; still, let us try  it; we shall only be thought to have been trifling if there is nothing  in what we say) from the fact of everything being to no purpose  (_nequicquam_) in such a man; from which circumstance he is called also  _Nihil_, nothing. Whoever is frugal, then, or, if it is more agreeable  to you, whoever is moderate and temperate, such a one must of course be  consistent; whoever is consistent, must be quiet; the quiet man must be  free from all perturbation, therefore from grief likewise: and these  are the properties of a wise man; therefore a wise man must be free  from grief.    IX. So that Dionysius of Heraclea is right when, upon this complaint of  Achilles in Homer,        Well hast thou spoke, but at the tyrant's name      My rage rekindles, and my soul's in flame:      'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave,      Disgraced, dishonor'd like the vilest slave[37]--    he reasons thus: Is the hand as it should be, when it is affected with  a swelling? or is it possible for any other member of the body, when  swollen or enlarged, to be in any other than a disordered state? Must  not the mind, then, when it is puffed up, or distended, be out of  order? But the mind of a wise man is always free from every kind of  disorder: it never swells, never is puffed up; but the mind when in  anger is in a different state. A wise man, therefore, is never angry;  for when he is angry, he lusts after something; for whoever is angry  naturally has a longing desire to give all the pain he can to the  person who he thinks has injured him; and whoever has this earnest  desire must necessarily be much pleased with the accomplishment of his  wishes; hence he is delighted with his neighbor's misery; and as a wise  man is not capable of such feelings as these, he is therefore not  capable of anger. But should "]]]
