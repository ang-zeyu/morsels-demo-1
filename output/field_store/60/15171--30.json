Undoing one, she brought to light the miniature of her father which she  had painted. She carried it to the lamp and stood for some minutes gazing  down upon the beloved face with fast-falling tears.    \"Oh, papa, papa!\" she murmured, \"how hard it is to live without you!\"    At length closing the case and restoring it to the box whence she had  taken it, she gathered up the other parcels and went first to her mother's  dressing-room, where she laid the little box on the toilet-table, then on  to the rooms occupied by her younger sister and brothers, leaving a gift  for each.    Going back to her own rooms, she espied a letter directed to herself,  which she had not noticed before. She had seen Capt. Raymond's handwriting  frequently during the weeks he had been at Ion, and recognized it at a  glance. The rich color rushed over face and neck, and her heart beat fast.    \"Agnes,\" she said to her maid, \"you may go now; I shall not need you any  more to-night,\" and the girl went out, leaving her alone.    Even then she did not at once open her letter, but moved slowly back and  forth for some minutes, with it in her hand. Then kneeling down she asked  earnestly for heavenly guidance in this important crisis of her life.    Looking into her own heart that day, she had learned that she was far from  indifferent to him who had asked her to exchange with him vows of mutual  love and trust, and to be the partner of his joys and sorrows. She was not  indifferent, but did she love him well enough to leave, for his sake, the  dear home of her childhood and the sweet mother to whom her heart had ever  clung with the most ardent affection?          CHAPTER XIV.        \"Nor less was she in heart affected,       But that she masked it with modesty,       For fear she should of lightness be detected.\"                      --_Spenser's \"Fairy Queen.\"_      Violet had lingered at the Laurels, with her Aunt Rose, for some hours  after her mother returned to Ion with the children, and in the meanwhile  there had been a long talk between Mrs. Travilla and Capt. Raymond, in  which he had pleaded his cause with all the eloquence an ardent passion  could inspire.    Elsie's answer was, \"If you have won my daughter's heart, her hand shall  not be refused you. But she is yet too young for the grave  responsibilities of married life. Nor can I reconcile myself to the  thought of parting with her so soon; therefore I should greatly prefer to  have the matter dropped, at least for the present.\"    The captain repeated what he had said to Mr. Dinsmore in regard to his  willingness to leave Violet with her mother if only he might have her for  his wife.    \"That would be very pleasant,\" Elsie said her eyes shining; \"and so far  you have the decided advantage of a suitor who would carry her away from  us; but, Captain, you are a father, and the woman whom you marry should be  not only a wife to you, but also a mother to your children; but for that  care and responsibility my little Vi is, I fear, far too young. Indeed, my  mother heart can ill brook the thought of her being so burdened in the  very morning of her life.\"    \"Nor should I be willing to burden her, my dear Mrs. Travilla,\" he said  with feeling; \"she should never bear the lightest burden that I could save  her from. But, my dear madam, would my children be any better off if I  should remain single? I think not, and I also think that should I marry  another while my heart is your daughter's, I should be doing very wrong.  But I cannot; if I fail to win her I shall remain as I am to the end of my  days.\"    \"I trust not,\" she said; \"you may get over this and meet with some one  else with whom you can be very happy.\"    He shook his head very decidedly. \"I feel that that is impossible. But how  was it in your own case, Mrs. Travilla? Mrs. Dinsmore is, I understand,  but a few years older than yourself.\"    \"That is quite true, sir; and I know papa never let her take any  responsibility in regard to me, but taught, trained, and cared for me in  all respects himself; he was father and mother both to me,\" she said with  a lovely smile; \"but you, my dear sir, are so situated that you could not  follow his example; you can neither stay at home with your children nor  take them to sea with you.\"    \"True, but they can stay where they are quite as well if I am married as  if I remain without a wife. I love them very dearly, Mrs. Travilla, and  earnestly desire to do my whole duty to them, but I do not think it a part  of that either to do without the dear little wife I covet, or to burden  her with cares unsuited to her tender years. Are you not willing to let me  settle this question of duty for myself?\"    \"I certainly have not the shadow of a right or inclination to attempt to  settle any question of duty for you, sir,\" she answered with sweet  gentleness, \"but I must, I think, try to help my dear child to consider  such questions for herself. And with her, after all, must the decision of  this matter remain.\"    Both mother and lover waited with anxiety for that decision, and while  waiting the captain wrote his letter, the mother busied herself with her  accustomed cares and duties as daughter, mother, mistress, and hostess,  each heart lifting up silent petitions that the result might be for God's  glory and the best interests of all concerned.    Elsie was not surprised that Violet did not join the family that evening  on her return from the Laurels.    \"She doubtless wants a talk with her mother first,\" was her silent comment  on learning that Vi had gone directly to that part of the house in which  the private apartments of the family were situated, and presently, as all  separated for the night, she sought her own dressing-room, expecting to  find Violet waiting for her there.    But the room was unoccupied; one swift glance revealed that fact, and also  showed her the box Violet had left on her toilet-table, and beside it some  little token of love and remembrance from each of the other members of the  family.    A label on each told who was the giver, and breathed of tender affection  to her for whom it was prepared.    She looked them over with glistening eyes, a heart full of gratitude for  the loves still left her, though sore with the thought, recalled by every  anniversary, of him who was gone, and a sweet and beautiful smile playing  about her lips.    Violet's gift was the last to be taken up and examined. So life-like was  the pictured face suddenly exposed to Elsie's view that it startled her  almost as if he had come in and stood by her side. The label told her it  was from Violet, but even without that she would have recognized it as her  work; and that it was so made it all the more precious to the widowed  mother.    She was gazing intently upon it, her lips quivering, the big tears  dropping fast down her cheeks, as Violet, with Capt. Raymond's letter in  her hand, opened the door, came softly in, and glided noiselessly to her  side.    \"Dearest mamma,\" she murmured, stealing an arm about her mother's waist,  \"does it please you?\"    \"Nothing could be more like him! My darling, thank you a thousand times!\"    \"I painted almost entirely from memory, mamma, and it was emphatically a  labor of love--love to you and to him. Oh, how sadly sweet it was to see  the dear face growing day by day under my hand!\"    \"Has your grandpa seen it?\"    \"Yes, mamma, he used to come in sometimes and watch me at my work. He  thinks as you do of the likeness. Ah, I hear his step!\" and she hastened  to open the door for him.    \"I thought I should find you here,\" he said, kissing her on both cheeks,  then drawing her near the light and gazing with keen, loving scrutiny into  the blushing face.    \"Elsie daughter,\" turning to her--\"Ah!\" as he perceived her emotion and  took note of the miniature in her hand, \"is it not a speaking likeness?\"    \"Yes, papa,\" she said in a trembling voice, going to him to lay her head  on his breast while he clasped her in his arms, \"but it has roused such an  intense longing in my heart!        \"'Oh, for the touch of a vanished hand,        And the sound of a voice that is still!\"    \"Dearest child!\" he said tenderly, \"the separation is only for time, and a  long eternity of reunion will follow. 'Our light affliction, which is but  for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of  glory.'\"    \"'But for a moment!'\" she repeated. \"Yes, it will seem like that when it  is past, though now the road looks so long and lonely.\"    \"Ah, dearest!\" he said, softly smoothing her hair, \"remember that nearer,  dearer Friend whose promise is, 'I will never leave thee, nor forsake  thee.'\"    Presently she lifted her head, wiped away her tears, and as her father  released her from his arms, turned to her daughter with a tenderly  interested and inquiring look.    \"What is it, my darling?\" she asked, glancing at the letter in the young  girl's hand.    Violet gave it to her, saying, with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks, \"I  found it on my dressing-table, mamma. It is from him--Capt. Raymond--and I  have written a note in reply.\"    \"Shall I go away, Vi, and leave you and your mamma to your confidences?\"  Mr. Dinsmore asked playfully, putting an arm about each and looking with  smiling eyes from one to the other.    \"No, grandpa, please stay; you know I have no secrets from you,\" Violet  answered, half hiding her face on his shoulder.    \"And are grandpa and I to read both epistles--yours and his?\" asked her  mother.    \"If you please, mamma. But mine is not to be given unless you both  approve.\"    The captain's was a straightforward, manly letter, renewing his offer with  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#20)"],[1,"he was entitled to spend his last years in comfort and  happiness with his old friend, Captain Smith.    So, the next morning Jan was brought to the entrance of the Hospice,  and there, as before, he saw Captain Smith on the mule. The captain's  daughter and her husband were mounted on the other mules, and the guide  had started along the trail.    Jan looked at the monks who were grouped on the stone steps, then he  looked at the captain. The mules moved slowly behind the guide. Prince  Jan gave a pitiful little whimper as he saw them go. Then he heard the  voice of the monk who now had charge of the kennels.    \"Go on, Jan!\"    The dog took a few steps and stopped. The monks were smiling and  pointing toward the trail that led to Martigny. He turned and watched  those who were riding down that trail. They reached the gap and paused.    Jan stood with trembling body, his eyes filled with longing and grief.  Then clear and strong he heard the voice he loved.    \"Come on, Jan! We're going home now!\"    \"Woof! Woof!\" the answer woke the echoes sleeping in the hearts of the  mountains, the dogs of the Hospice took up the call of their kin, and  the big dog dashed swiftly along the trail until he reached the little  group.    Leaping up, he licked the poundmaster's hand. Then with head erect,  Prince Jan, for the last time, travelled the trail of his ancestors. He  did not know where he was going, but it made no difference to him. His  master was looking down at him and smiling."]]]
