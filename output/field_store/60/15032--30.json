Max Piccolomini just left you?    WALLENSTEIN.                 Where is Wrangel?    TERZKY.    He is already gone.    WALLENSTEIN.                 In such a hurry?    TERZKY.    It is as if the earth had swallow'd him.  He had scarce left thee when I went to seek him.  I wish'd some words with him--but he was gone.  How, when, and where, could no one tell me. Nay,  I half believe it was the devil himself;  A human creature could not so at once  Have vanish'd.    ILLO (_enters_).                     Is it true that thou wilt send  Octavio?    TERZKY.              How, Octavio! Whither send him?    WALLENST.    He goes to Frauenburg, and will lead hither  The Spanish and Italian regiments.    ILLO.                       No!  Nay, Heaven forbid!    WALLENSTEIN.    And why should Heaven forbid?    ILLO.    Him!--that deceiver! Wouldst thou trust to him  The soldiery? Him wilt thou let slip from thee,  Now in the very instant that decides us--    TERZKY.    Thou wilt not do this--No! I pray thee, no!    WALLENST.    Ye are whimsical.    ILLO.                 O but for this time, Duke,  Yield to our warning! Let him not depart.    WALLENST.    And why should I not trust him only this time,  Who have always trusted him? What, then, has happen'd  That I should lose my good opinion of him?  In complaisance to your whims, not my own,  I must, forsooth, give up a rooted judgment.  Think not I am a woman. Having trusted him  E'en till today, today too will I trust him.    TERZKY.    Must it be he--he only? Send another.    WALLENST.    It must be he whom I myself have chosen;  He is well fitted for the business. Therefore  I gave it him.    ILLO.                           Because he's an Italian--  Therefore is he well fitted for the business!    WALLENST.    I know you love them not--nor sire nor son--  Because that I esteem them, love them--visibly  Esteem them, love them more than you and others.  E'en as they merit. Therefore are they eye-blights,  Thorns in your foot-path. But your jealousies,  In what affect they me or my concerns?  Are they the worse to _me_ because you hate them?  Love or hate one another as you will,  I leave to each man his own moods and likings;  Yet know the worth of each of you to me.    ILLO.    Von Questenberg, while he was here, was always  Lurking about with this Octavio.    WALLENST.    It happen'd with my knowledge and permission.    ILLO.    I know that secret messengers came to him  From Gallas--    WALLENSTEIN.                        That's not true.    ILLO.                       O thou art blind,  With thy deep-seeing eyes!    WALLENSTEIN.                       Thou wilt not shake  My faith for me--my faith, which founds itself  On the profoundest science. If 'tis false,  Then the whole science of the stars is false;  For know, I have a pledge from Fate itself,  That he is the most faithful of my friends.    ILLO.    Hast thou a pledge, that this pledge is not false?    WALLENST.    There exist moments in the life of man,  When he is nearer the great Soul of the world  Than is man's custom, and possesses freely  The power of questioning his destiny:  And such a moment 'twas, when in the night  Before the action in the plains of Luetzen,  Leaning against a tree, thoughts crowding thoughts,  I look'd out far upon the ominous plain.  My whole life, past and future, in this moment  Before my mind's eye glided in procession,  And to the destiny of the next morning  The spirit, fill'd with anxious presentiment,  Did knit the most removed futurity.  Then said I also to myself: \"So many  Dost thou command. They follow all thy stars  And as on some great number set their All  Upon thy single head, and only man  The vessel of thy fortune. Yet a day  Will come when Destiny shall once more scatter  All these in many a several direction:  Few be they who will stand out faithful to thee.\"  I yearn'd to know which one was faithfullest  Of all, this camp included. Great Destiny,  Give me a sign! And he shall be the man,  Who, on the approaching morning, comes the first  To meet me with a token of his love.  And thinking this, I fell into a slumber.  Then midmost in the battle was I led  In spirit. Great the pressure and the tumult!  Then was my horse kil'd under me; I sank;  And over me away, all unconcernedly,  Drove horse and rider--and thus trod to pieces  I lay, and panted like a dying man;  Then seized me suddenly a savior arm;  It was Octavio's--I awoke at once;  'Twas broad day, and _Octavio_ stood before me.  \"My brother,\" said he, \"do not ride today  The dapple, as you're wont; but mount the horse  Which I have chosen for thee. Do it, brother!  In love to me. A strong dream warn'd me so.\"  It was the swiftness of his horse that snatch'd me  From the hot pursuit of Bannier's dragoons.  My cousin rode the dapple on that day,  And never more saw I of horse or rider.    ILLO.    That was a chance.    WALLENSTEIN (_significantly_).                  There's no such thing as chance.  [And what to us seems merest accident  Springs from the deepest source of destiny.]  In brief, 'tis sign'd and seal'd that this Octavio  Is my good angel--and now no word more.                                 [_He is retiring_.]    TERZKY.    This is my comfort--Max remains our hostage.    ILLO.    And he shall never stir from here alive.    WALLENSTEIN (_stops and turns himself round_).    Are ye not like the women who forever  Only recur to their first word, although  One had been talking reason by the hour!  Know that the human being's thoughts and needs  Are not like ocean billows, blindly moved.  The inner world, his microcosmus, is  The deep shaft out of which they spring eternally.  They grow by certain laws, like the tree's fruit--  No juggling chance can metamorphose them.  Have I the human _kernel_ first examined?  Then I know, too, the future will and action.                                     [_Exeunt_.]      SCENE IV      _Chamber in the residence of Piccolomini_    OCTAVIO PICCOLOMINI (_attired for traveling_), AN ADJUTANT    OCTAVIO.    Is the detachment here?    ADJUT.                           It awaits below.    OCTAVIO.    And are the soldiers trusty, Adjutant?  Say, from what regiment hast thou chosen them?    ADJUT. From Tiefenbach's.    OCTAVIO.                        That regiment is loyal;  Keep them in silence in the inner court,  Unseen by all, and when the signal peals  Then close the doors; keep watch upon the house,  And all ye meet be instantly arrested.                                [_Exit Adjutant_.]    I hope indeed I shall not need their service,  So certain feel I of my well laid plans;  But when an empire's safety is at stake  'Twere better too much caution than too little.      SCENE V    _A Chamber in PICCOLOMINI's Dwelling-House_.    OCTAVIO PICCOLOMINI, ISOLANI, _entering_    ISOLANI.    Here am I--Well! who comes yet of the others?    OCTAVIO (_with an air of mystery_).    But, first, a word with you, Count Isolani.    ISOLANI (_assuming the same air of mystery_).    Will it explode, ha?--Is the Duke about  To make the attempt? In me, friend, you may place  Full confidence--Nay, put me to the proof.    OCTAVIO.    That may happen.    ISOLANI.                           Noble brother, I am  Not one of those men who in words are valiant,  And when it comes to action skulk away.  The Duke has acted toward me as a friend.  God knows it is so; and I owe him all--  He may rely on my fidelity.    OCTAVIO.    That will be seen hereafter.    ISOLANI.                         Be on your guard,  All think not as I think; and there are many  Who still hold with the Court--yes, and they say  That those stolen signatures bind them to nothing.    [OCTAVIO.    Indeed! Pray name to me the chiefs that think so.    ISOLANI.    Plague upon them! all the Germans think so;  Esterhazy, Kaunitz, Deodati, too,  Insist upon obedience to the Court.]    OCTAVIO.                          I am rejoiced to hear it.    ISOLANI.    You rejoice    OCTAVIO.    That the Emperor has yet such gallant servants,  And loving friends!    ISOLANI.                   Nay, jeer not, I entreat you.  They are no such worthless fellows, I assure you.    OCTAVIO.    I am assured already. God forbid  That I should jest!--In very serious earnest,  I am rejoiced to see an honest cause  So strong.    ISOLANI.        The Devil!--what!--Why, what means this?  Are you not, then--For what, then, am I here?    OCTAVIO.    That you may make full declaration, whether  You will be call'd the friend or enemy  Of the Emperor.    ISOLANI (_with an air of defiance_).                       That declaration, friend,  I'll make to him in whom a right is placed  To put that question to me.    OCTAVIO.                            Whether, Count,  That right is mine, this paper may, instruct you.    ISOLANI (_stammering_).    Why,--why--what! this is the Emperor's hand and seal! [_Reads_.]  \"Whereas, the officers collectively  Throughout our army will obey the orders  Of the Lieutenant-General Piccolomini.  As from ourselves.\"--_Hem_--Yes! so I--  Yes! yes!--  I--I give you joy, Lieutenant-General!    OCTAVIO.    And you submit you to the order?    ISOLANI.                                   I--  But you have taken me so by surprise--  Time for reflection one _must_ have--    OCTAVIO.                           Two minutes.    ISOLANI.    My God! But then the case is--    OCTAVIO.                           Plain and simple  You must declare you, whether you determine  To act a treason 'gainst your Lord and Sovereign,  Or whether you will serve him faithfully.    ISOLANI.    Treason!--My God!--But who talks then of  treason?    OCTAVIO.    That is the case. The Prince-duke is a traitor--  Means to lead over to the enemy  The Emperor's army.--Now, Count!--brief  and full--  Say, will you break your oath to the Emperor?  Sell yourself to the enemy?--Say, will you?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#20)"],[1,"and the Serbs, not before the Russians had won several successes  against the Turks on the Lower Danube. It was during the two following  years of peace that dissensions first broke out amongst the Serbian  leaders; fighting the Turks was the sole condition of existence which  prevented them fighting each other. In 1809-10 Russia and the Serbs again  fought the Turks, at first without success, but later with better fortune.  In 1811 Kara-George was elected _Gospodar_, or sovereign, by a popular  assembly, but Serbia still remained a Turkish province. At the end of that  year the Russians completely defeated the Turks at Rustchuk in Bulgaria,  and, if all had gone well, Serbia might there and then have achieved  complete independence.    But Napoleon was already preparing his invasion and Russia had to conclude  peace with Turkey in a hurry, which necessarily implied that the Sultan  obtained unduly favourable terms. In the Treaty of Bucarest between the  two countries signed in May 1812, the Serbs were indeed mentioned, and  promised vague internal autonomy and a general amnesty, but all the  fortified towns they had captured were to be returned to the Turks, and  the few Russian troops who had been helping the Serbs in Serbia had to  withdraw. Negotiations between the Turks and the Serbs for the regulation  of their position were continued throughout 1812, but finally the Turks  refused all their claims and conditions and, seeing the European powers  preoccupied with their own affairs, invaded the country from Bosnia in the  west, and also from the east and south, in August 1813. The Serbs, left  entirely to their own resources, succumbed before the superior forces of  the Turks, and by the beginning of October the latter were again masters  of the whole country and in possession of Belgrade. Meanwhile Kara-George,  broken in health and unable to cope with the difficulties of the  situation, which demanded successful strategy both against the  overwhelming forces of the Turks in the field and against the intrigues of  his enemies at home, somewhat ignominiously fled across the river to  Semlin in Hungary, and was duly incarcerated by the Austrian authorities.    The news of Napoleon's defeat at Leipsic (October 1813) arrived just after  that of the re-occupation of Belgrade by the Turks, damped _feu-de-joie_  which they were firing at Constantinople, and made them rather more  conciliatory and lenient to the Serbian rebels. But this attitude did not  last long, and the Serbs soon had reason to make fresh efforts to regain  their short-lived liberty. The Congress of Vienna met in the autumn of  1814, and during its whole course Serbian emissaries gave the Russian  envoys no peace. But with the return of Napoleon to France in the spring  of 1815 and the break-up of the Congress, all that Russia could do was,  through its ambassador at Constantinople, to threaten invasion unless the  Turks left the Serbs alone. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia became so  intolerable that another rebellion soon took shape, this time under  Milo[)s] Obrenovi['c]. This leader was no less patriotic than his rival,  Kara-George, but he was far more able and a consummate diplomat.  Kara-George had possessed indomitable courage, energy, and will-power, but  he could not temporize, and his arbitrary methods of enforcing discipline  and his ungovernable temper had made him many enemies. While the credit  for the first Serbian revolt (1804-13) undoubtedly belongs chiefly to him,  the second revolt owed its more lasting success to the skill of Milo[)s]  Obrenovi['c]. The fighting started at Takovo, the home of the Obrenovi['c]  family, in April 1815, and after many astonishing successes against the  Turks, including the capture of the towns of Rudnik, [)C]a[)c]ak,  Po[)z]arevac, and Kraljevo, was all over by July of the same year. The  Turks were ready with large armies in the west in Bosnia, and also south  of the Morava river, to continue the campaign and crush the rebellion, but  the news of the final defeat of Napoleon, and the knowledge that Russia  would soon have time again to devote attention to the Balkans, withheld  their appetites for revenge, and negotiations with the successful rebels  were initiated. During the whole of this period, from 1813 onwards,  Milo[)s] Obrenovi['c], as head of a district, was an official of the  Sultan in Serbia, and it was one of his principles never to break  irreparably with the Turks, who were still suzerains of the country. At  the same time, owing to his skill and initiative he was recognized as the  only real leader of the movement for independence. From the cessation of  the rebellion in 1815 onwards he himself personally conducted negotiations  in the name of his people with the various pashas who were deputed to deal  with him. While these negotiations went on and the armistice was in force,  he was confronted, or rather harassed from behind, by a series of revolts  against his growing authority on the part of his jealous compatriots.    In June 1817 Kara-George, who had been in Russia after being released by  the Austrians in 1814, returned surreptitiously to Serbia, encouraged by  the brighter aspect which affairs in his country seemed to be assuming.  But the return of his most dangerous rival was as unwelcome to Milo[)s] as  it was to the Turkish authorities at Belgrade, and, measures having been  concerted between them, Kara-George was murdered on July 26,1817, and the  first act in the blood-feud between the two families thus committed. In  November of the same year a _skup[)s]tina_, or national assembly, was held  at Belgrade, and Milo[)s] Obrenovi['c], whose position was already  thoroughly assured, was elected hereditary prince (_knez_) of the country.    Meanwhile events of considerable importance for the future of the Serb  race had been happening elsewhere. Dalmatia, the whole of which had been  in the possession of Venice since the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, passed  into the hands of Austria by the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, when the  Venetian republic was extinguished by Napoleon. The Bocche di Cuttaro, a  harbour both strategically and commercially of immense value, which had in  the old days belonged to the Serb principality of Zeta or Montenegro, and  is its only natural outlet on the Adriatic, likewise became Venetian in  1699 and Austrian in 1797, one year after the successful rebellion of the  Montenegrins against the Turks.    By the Treaty of Pressburg between France and Austria Dalmatia became  French in 1805. But the Montenegrins, supported by the Russians, resisted  the new owners and occupied the Bocche; at the Peace of Tilsit in 1807,  however, this important place was assigned to France by Russia, and  Montenegro had to submit to its loss. In 1806 the French occupied Ragusa,  and in 1808 abolished the independence of the ancient Serb city-republic.  In 1812 the Montenegrins, helped by the Russians and British, again  expelled the French and reoccupied Cattaro; but Austria was by now fully  alive to the meaning this harbour would have once it was in the possession  of Montenegro, and after the Congress of Vienna in 1815 took definitive  possession of it as well as of all the rest of Dalmatia, thus effecting  the complete exclusion of the Serb race for all political and commercial  purposes from the Adriatic, its most natural and obvious means of  communication with western Europe.    Though Milo[)s] had been elected prince by his own people, it was long  before he was recognized as such by the Porte. His efforts for the  regularization of his position entailed endless negotiations in  Constantinople; these were enlivened by frequent anti-Obrenovi['c] revolts  in Serbia, all of which Milo[)s] successfully quelled. The revolution in  Greece in 1821 threw the Serbian question from the international point of  view into the shade, but the Emperor Nicholas I, who succeeded his brother  Alexander I on the Russian throne in 1825, soon showed that he took a  lively and active interest in Balkan affairs. Pan-Slavism had scarcely  become fashionable in those days, and it was still rather as the protector  of its co-religionists under the Crescent that Russia intervened. In 1826  Russian and Turkish delegates met at Akerman in Bessarabia, and in  September of that year signed a convention by which the Russian  protectorate over the Serbs was recognized, the Serbs were granted  internal autonomy, the right to trade and erect churches, schools, and  printing-presses, and the Turks were forbidden to live in Serbia except in  eight garrison towns; the garrisons were to be Turkish, and tribute was  still to be paid to the Sultan as suzerain. These concessions, announced  by Prince Milo[)s] to his people at a special _skup[)s]tina_ held at  Kragujevac in 1827, evoked great enthusiasm, but the urgency of the Greek  question again delayed their fulfilment. After the battle of Navarino on  October 20, 1827, in which the British, French, and Russian fleets  defeated the Turkish, the Turks became obstinate and refused to carry out  the stipulations of the Convention of Akerman in favour of Serbia.  Thereupon Russia declared war on Turkey in April 1828, and the Russian  armies crossed the Danube and the Balkans and marched on Constantinople.    Peace was concluded at Adrianople in 1829, and Turkey agreed to carry out  immediately all the stipulations of the Treaty of Bucarest (1812) and the  Convention of Akerman (1826). The details took some time to settle, but in  November 1830 the _hatti-sherif_ of the Sultan, acknowledging Milo[)s] as  hereditary prince of Serbia, was publicly read in Belgrade. All the  concessions already promised were duly granted, and Serbia became  virtually independent, but still tributary to the Sultan. Its territory  included most of the northern part of the modern kingdom of Serbia,  between the rivers Drina, Save, Danube, and Timok,"]]]
