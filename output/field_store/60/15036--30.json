The market wagon, loaded in such a way as to leave ample space in the  interior for us, will be drawn up outside the office of Messrs. Pike  and Pike, in Covent Garden, until about five o'clock this afternoon. At,  say, half past four, I propose that we meet there and embark upon the  journey.\"    The speaker glanced in my direction interrogatively.    \"Include me in the program,\" I said. \"Will there be room in the wagon?\"    \"Certainly,\" was the reply; \"it is most commodious, but I cannot  guarantee its comfort.\"    Nayland Smith promenaded the room, unceasingly, and presently he walked  out altogether, only to return ere the inspector and I had had time to  exchange more than a glance of surprise, carrying a brass ash-tray. He  placed this on a corner of the breakfast table before Weymouth.    \"Ever seen anything like that?\" he inquired.    The inspector examined the gruesome relic with obvious curiosity,  turning it over with the tip of his little finger and manifesting  considerable repugnance--in touching it at all. Smith and I watched  him in silence, and, finally, placing the tray again upon the table, he  looked up in a puzzled way.    \"It's something like the skin of a water rat,\" he said.    Nayland Smith stared at him fixedly.    \"A water rat? Now that you come to mention it, I perceive a certain  resemblance--yes. But\"--he had been wearing a silk scarf about his  throat and now he unwrapped it--\"did you ever see a water rat that could  make marks like these?\"    Weymouth started to his feet with some muttered exclamation.    \"What is this?\" he cried. \"When did it happen, and how?\"    In his own terse fashion, Nayland Smith related the happenings of the  night. At the conclusion of the story:    \"By heaven!\" whispered Weymouth, \"the thing on the roof--the coughing  thing that goes on all fours, seen by Burke...\"    \"My own idea exactly!\" cried Smith...    \"Fu-Manchu,\" I said excitedly, \"has brought some new, some dreadful  creature, from Burma...\"    \"No, Petrie,\" snapped Smith, turning upon me suddenly. \"Not from  Burma--from Abyssinia.\"    That day was destined to be an eventful one; a day never to be forgotten  by any of us concerned in those happenings which I have to record. Early  in the morning Nayland Smith set off for the British Museum to  pursue his mysterious investigations, and having performed my brief  professional round (for, as Nayland Smith had remarked on one occasion,  this was a beastly healthy district), I found, having made the necessary  arrangements, that, with over three hours to spare, I had nothing to  occupy my time until the appointment in Covent Garden Market. My lonely  lunch completed, a restless fit seized me, and I felt unable to remain  longer in the house. Inspired by this restlessness, I attired myself  for the adventure of the evening, not neglecting to place a pistol in  my pocket, and, walking to the neighboring Tube station, I booked to  Charing Cross, and presently found myself rambling aimlessly along the  crowded streets. Led on by what link of memory I know not, I presently  drifted into New Oxford Street, and looked up with a start--to learn  that I stood before the shop of a second-hand book-seller where once two  years before I had met Karamaneh.    The thoughts conjured up at that moment were almost too bitter to be  borne, and without so much as glancing at the books displayed for sale,  I crossed the roadway, entered Museum Street, and, rather in order to  distract my mind than because I contemplated any purchase, began to  examine the Oriental Pottery, Egyptian statuettes, Indian armor, and  other curios, displayed in the window of an antique dealer.    But, strive as I would to concentrate my mind upon the objects in the  window, my memories persistently haunted me, and haunted me to the  exclusion even of the actualities. The crowds thronging the Pavement,  the traffic in New Oxford Street, swept past unheeded; my eyes saw  nothing of pot nor statuette, but only met, in a misty imaginative  world, the glance of two other eyes--the dark and beautiful eyes of  Karamaneh. In the exquisite tinting of a Chinese vase dimly perceptible  in the background of the shop, I perceived only the blushing cheeks  of Karamaneh; her face rose up, a taunting phantom, from out of the  darkness between a hideous, gilded idol and an Indian sandalwood screen.    I strove to dispel this obsessing thought, resolutely fixing my  attention upon a tall Etruscan vase in the corner of the window, near to  the shop door. Was I losing my senses indeed? A doubt of my own sanity  momentarily possessed me. For, struggle as I would to dispel the  illusion--there, looking out at me over that ancient piece of pottery,  was the bewitching face of the slave-girl!    Probably I was glaring madly, and possibly I attracted the notice of the  passers-by; but of this I cannot be certain, for all my attention was  centered upon that phantasmal face, with the cloudy hair, slightly  parted red lips, and the brilliant dark eyes which looked into mine out  of the shadows of the shop.    It was bewildering--it was uncanny; for, delusion or verity, the glamour  prevailed. I exerted a great mental effort, stepped to the door, turned  the handle, and entered the shop with as great a show of composure as I  could muster.    A curtain draped in a little door at the back of one counter swayed  slightly, with no greater violence than may have been occasioned by  the draught. But I fixed my eyes upon this swaying curtain almost  fiercely... as an impassive half-caste of some kind who appeared to be a  strange cross between a Graeco-Hebrew and a Japanese, entered and quite  unemotionally faced me, with a slight bow.    So wholly unexpected was this apparition that I started back.    \"Can I show you anything, sir?\" inquired the new arrival, with a second  slight inclination of the head.    I looked at him for a moment in silence. Then:    \"I thought I saw a lady of my acquaintance here a moment ago,\" I said.  \"Was I mistaken?\"    \"Quite mistaken, sir,\" replied the shopman, raising his black eyebrows  ever so slightly; \"a mistake possibly due to a reflection in the window.  Will you take a look around now that you are here?\"    \"Thank you,\" I replied, staring him hard in the face; \"at some other  time.\"    I turned and quitted the shop abruptly. Either I was mad, or Karamaneh  was concealed somewhere therein.    However, realizing my helplessness in the matter, I contented myself  with making a mental note of the name which appeared above the  establishment--J. Salaman--and walked on, my mind in a chaotic condition  and my heart beating with unusual rapidity.        CHAPTER XVI. THE QUESTING HANDS    Within my view, from the corner of the room where I sat in deepest  shadow, through the partly opened window (it was screwed, like our own)  were rows of glass-houses gleaming in the moonlight, and, beyond them,  orderly ranks of flower-beds extending into a blue haze of distance. By  reason of the moon's position, no light entered the room, but my eyes,  from long watching, were grown familiar with the darkness, and I could  see Burke quite clearly as he lay in the bed between my post and the  window. I seemed to be back again in those days of the troubled past  when first Nayland Smith and I had come to grips with the servants of  Dr. Fu-Manchu. A more peaceful scene than this flower-planted corner  of Essex it would be difficult to imagine; but, either because of my  knowledge that its peace was chimerical, or because of that outflung  consciousness of danger which, actually, or in my imagination, preceded  the coming of the Chinaman's agents, to my seeming the silence throbbed  electrically and the night was laden with stilly omens.    Already cramped by my journey in the market-cart, I found it difficult  to remain very long in any one position. What information had Burke  to sell? He had refused, for some reason, to discuss the matter that  evening, and now, enacting the part allotted him by Nayland Smith, he  feigned sleep consistently, although at intervals he would whisper to me  his doubts and fears.    All the chances were in our favor to-night; for whilst I could not doubt  that Dr. Fu-Manchu was set upon the removal of the ex-officer of New  York police, neither could I doubt that our presence in the farm was  unknown to the agents of the Chinaman. According to Burke, constant  attempts had been made to achieve Fu-Manchu's purpose, and had only been  frustrated by his (Burke's) wakefulness.    There was every probability that another attempt would be made to-night.    Any one who has been forced by circumstance to undertake such a vigil as  this will be familiar with the marked changes (corresponding with  phases of the earth's movement) which take place in the atmosphere, at  midnight, at two o'clock, and again at four o'clock. During those fours  hours falls a period wherein all life is at its lowest ebb, and every  Physician is aware that there is a greater likelihood of a patient's  passing between midnight and four A. M., than at any other period during  the cycle of the hours.    To-night I became specially aware of this lowering of vitality, and  now, with the night at that darkest phase which precedes the dawn, an  indescribable dread, such as I had known before in my dealings with  the Chinaman, assailed me, when I was least prepared to combat it. The  stillness was intense. Then:    \"Here it is!\" whispered Burke from the bed.    The chill at the very center of my being, which but corresponded with  the chill of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#20)"],[1," looked towards the paddle.    \"Your turn with the paddle now, Hooker,\" said he.    And his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket, passed  Evans carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid, like  those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted.    Evans sat with his eyes half closed, watching the frothy breakwater of the  coral creep nearer and nearer. The sky was like a furnace, for the sun was  near the zenith. Though they were so near the Treasure he did not feel the  exaltation he had anticipated. The intense excitement of the struggle for  the plan, and the long night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned  canoe had, to use his own expression, \"taken it out of him.\" He tried to  arouse himself by directing his mind to the ingots the Chinamen had spoken  of, but it would not rest there; it came back headlong to the thought of  sweet water rippling in the river, and to the almost unendurable dryness  of his lips and throat. The rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was  becoming audible now, and it had a pleasant sound in his ears; the water  washed along the side of the canoe, and the paddle dripped between each  stroke. Presently he began to doze.    He was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture  interwove with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and  Hooker had hit upon the Chinamen's secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the  little fire burning, and the black figures of the three Chinamen--silvered  on one side by moonlight, and on the other glowing from the firelight--and  heard them talking together in pigeon-English--for they came from  different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of their talk first, and  had motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the conversation were  inaudible, and fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish galleon from the  Philippines hopelessly aground, and its treasure buried against the day of  return, lay in the background of the story; a shipwrecked crew thinned by  disease, a quarrel or so, and the needs of discipline, and at last taking  to their boats never to be heard of again. Then Chang-hi, only a year  since, wandering ashore, had happened upon the ingots hidden for two  hundred years, had deserted his junk, and reburied them with infinite  toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid great stress on the safety--it  was a secret of his. Now he wanted help to return and exhume them.  Presently the little map fluttered and the voices sank. A fine story for  two, stranded British wastrels to hear! Evans' dream shifted to the moment  when he had Chang-hi's pigtail in his hand. The life of a Chinaman is  scarcely sacred like a European's. The cunning little face of Chang-hi,  first keen and furious like a startled snake, and then fearful,  treacherous, and pitiful, became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream. At  the end Chang-hi had grinned, a most incomprehensible and startling grin.  Abruptly things became very unpleasant, as they will do at times in  dreams. Chang-hi gibbered and threatened him. He saw in his dream heaps  and heaps of gold, and Chang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him  back from it. He took Chang-hi by the pig-tail--how big the yellow brute  was, and how he struggled and grinned! He kept growing bigger, too. Then  the bright heaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace, and a vast devil,  surprisingly like Chang-hi, but with a huge black tail, began to feed him  with coals. They burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil was shouting his  name: \"Evans, Evans, you sleepy fool!\"--or was it Hooker?    He woke up. They were in the mouth of the lagoon.    \"There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of  bushes,\" said his companion. \"Mark that. If we, go to those bushes and  then strike into the bush in a straight line from here, we shall come to  it when we come to the stream.\"    They could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the sight  of it Evans revived. \"Hurry up, man,\" he said, \"or by heaven I shall have  to drink sea water!\" He gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver  among the rocks and green tangle.    Presently he turned almost fiercely upon Hooker. \"Give _me_ the  paddle,\" he said.    So they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water in  the hollow of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further he  tried again. \"This will do,\" he said, and they began drinking eagerly.    \"Curse this!\" said Evans suddenly. \"It's too slow.\" And, leaning  dangerously over the fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the water  with his lips.    Presently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a  little creek, were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the  water.    \"We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes  and get the line to the place,\" said Evans.    \"We had better paddle round,\" said Hooker.    So they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the  sea, and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew. Here  they landed, pulled the light canoe far up the beach, and then went up  towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the  reef and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had taken a native implement  out of the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece was armed with  polished stone. Hooker carried the paddle. \"It is straight now in this  direction,\" said he; \"we must push through this till we strike the stream.  Then we must prospect.\"    They pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young  trees, and at first it was toilsome going, but very speedily the trees  became larger and the ground beneath them opened out. The blaze of the  sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow. The trees  became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far  overhead. Dim white flowers hung from their stems, and ropy creepers swung  from tree to tree. The shadow deepened. On the ground, blotched fungi and  a red-brown incrustation became frequent.    Evans shivered. \"It seems almost cold here after the blaze outside.\"    \"I hope we are keeping to the straight,\" said Hooker.    Presently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white  shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant  green undergrowth and coloured flowers. Then they heard the rush of water.    \"Here is the river. We should be close to it now,\" said Hooker.    The vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet unnamed,  grew among the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of huge green  fans towards the strip of sky. Many flowers and a creeper with shiny  foliage clung to the exposed stems. On the water of the broad, quiet pool  which the treasure-seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves  and a waxen, pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily. Further, as the  river bent away from them, the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in  a rapid.    \"Well?\" said Evans.    \"We have swerved a little from the straight,\" said Hooker. \"That was to be  expected.\"    He turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind  them. \"If we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to  something.\"    \"You said--\" began Evans.    \"_He_ said there was a heap of stones,\" said Hooker.    The two men looked at each other for a moment.    \"Let us try a little down-stream first,\" said Evans.    They advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans  stopped. \"What the devil's that?\" he said.    Hooker followed his finger. \"Something blue,\" he said. It had come into  view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to  distinguish what it was.    He advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to the  limp hand and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the implement  he carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on his face. The  _abandon_ of the pose was unmistakable.    The two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this  ominous dead body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Near by was a  spade after the Chinese pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap of  stones, close to a freshly dug hole.    \"Somebody has been here before,\" said Hooker, clearing his throat.    Then suddenly Evans began to swear and rave, and stamp upon the ground.    Hooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate  body. He saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles  swollen. \"Pah!\" he said, and suddenly turned away and went towards the  excavation. He gave a cry of surprise. He shouted to Evans, who was  following him slowly.    \"You fool! It's all right. It's here still.\" Then he turned again and  looked at the dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.    Evans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch  beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole,  and, clearing off the soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of the  heavy masses out. As he did so a little thorn pricked his hand. He pulled  the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot.    \"Only gold or lead could weigh like this,\" he said exultantly.    Hooker was still looking at the dead Chinaman. He was puzzled.    \"He stole a march on his friends,\" he said at last. \"He came here alone,  and some poisonous snake has killed him... I wonder how he found the  place.\"    Evans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman signify?  \"We shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal, and bury it  there for a while. How shall we get it to the canoe?\"    He took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or three  ingots into it. Presently he found that another little thorn had punctured  his skin.    \"This is as much as we can "]]]
