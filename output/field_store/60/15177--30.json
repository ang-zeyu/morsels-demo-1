ALGOL AND SPICA.    By observations with the Potsdam spectograph, Professor Vogel found  that the bright star of Algol pulsated backward and forward in the  visual direction in a period corresponding to the known variation of  its light. The explanation which had been suggested for the star's  variability, that it was partially eclipsed at regular intervals of  68.8 hours by a dark companion large enough to cut off nearly  five-sixths of its light, was, therefore, the true one. The dark  companion, no longer able to hide itself by its obscureness, was  brought out into the light of direct observation by means of its  gravitational effects. Seventeen hours before minimum Algol was  receding at the rate of about 241/2 miles a second, while seventeen  hours after minimum it was found to be approaching with a speed of  about 281/2 miles. From these data, together with those of the variation  of its light, Vogel found, on the assumption that both stars have the  same density, that the companion, nearly as large as the sun, but with  about one-fourth his mass, revolved with a velocity of about  fifty-five miles a second. The bright star of about twice the size and  mass moved about the common center of gravity with the speed of about  26 miles a second. The system of the two stars, which were about 31/4  millions of miles apart, considered as a whole, was approaching us  with a velocity of 2.4 miles a second. The great difference in  luminosity of the two stars, not less than fifty times, suggested  rather that they were in different stages of condensation, and  dissimilar in density. It was obvious that if the orbit of a star with  an obscure companion was inclined to the line of sight, the companion  would pass above or below the bright star and produce no variation of  its light. Such systems might be numerous in the heavens. In Vogel's  photographs, Spica, which was not variable, by a small shifting of its  lines revealed a backward and forward periodical pulsation due to  orbital motion. As the pair whirled round their common center of  gravity, the bright star was sometimes advancing, at others receding.  They revolved in about four days, each star moving with a velocity of  about 56 miles a second in an orbit probably nearly circular, and  possessed a combined mass of rather more than two and one-half times  that of the sun. Taking the most probable value for the star's  parallax, the greatest angular separation of the stars would be far  too small to be detected with the most powerful telescopes.      THE VALUE OF PHOTOGRAPHY.    Referring to the new and great power which modern photography had put  into the hands of the astronomer, the president said that the modern  silver bromide gelatine plate, except for its grained texture, met his  needs at all points. It possessed extreme sensitiveness, it was always  ready for use, it could be placed in any position, it could be exposed  for hours, lastly it did not need immediate development, and for this  reason could be exposed again to the same object on succeeding nights,  so as to make up by several installments, as the weather might permit,  the total time of exposure which was deemed necessary. Without the  assistance of photography, however greatly the resources of genius  might overcome the optical and mechanical difficulties of constructing  large telescopes, the astronomer would have to depend in the last  resource upon his eye. Now, we could not by the force of continued  looking bring into view an object too feebly luminous to be seen at  the first and keenest moment of vision. But the feeblest light which  fell upon the plate was not lost, but taken in and stored up  continuously. Each hour the plate gathered up 3,600 times the light  energy which it received during the first second. It was by this power  of accumulation that the photographic plate might be said to increase,  almost without limit, though not in separating power, the optical  means at the disposal of the astronomer for the discovery or the  observation of faint objects.      TWO EXAMPLES.    Two principal directions might be pointed out in which photography was  of great service to the astronomer. It enabled him within the  comparatively short time of a single exposure to secure permanently  with great exactness the relative positions of hundreds or even of  thousands of stars, or the minute features of nebulae or other objects,  or the phenomena of a passing eclipse, a task which by means of the  eye and hand could only be accomplished, if done at all, after a very  great expenditure of time and labor. Photography put it in the power  of the astronomer to accomplish in the short span of his own life, and  so enter into their fruition, great works which otherwise must have  been passed on by him as a heritage of labor to succeeding  generations. The second great service which photography rendered was  not simply an aid to the powers the astronomer already possessed. On  the contrary, the plate, by recording light waves which were both too  small and too large to excite vision in the eye, brought him into a  new region of knowledge, such as the infra-red and the ultra-violet  parts of the spectrum, which must have remained forever unknown but  for artificial help.      A PHOTOGRAPHIC CHART.    The present year would be memorable in astronomical history for the  practical beginning of the photographic chart and catalogue of the  heavens which took their origin in an international conference which  met in Paris in 1887. The decisions of the conference in their final  form provided for the construction of a great chart with exposures  corresponding to forty minutes' exposure at Paris, which it was  expected would reach down to stars of about the fourteenth magnitude.  As each plate was to be limited to four square degrees, and as each  star, to avoid possible errors, was to appear on two plates, over  22,000 photographs would be required. A second set of plates for a  catalogue was to be taken, with a shorter exposure, which would give  stars to the eleventh magnitude only. The plans were to be pushed on  as actively a possible, though as far as might be practicable plates  for the chart were to be taken concurrently. Photographing the plates  for the catalogue was but the first step in this work, and only  supplied the data for the elaborate measurements which would have to  be made, which were, however, less laborious than would be required  for a similar catalogue without the aid of photography.      A DELICATE OPERATION.    The determination of the distances of the fixed stars from the small  apparent shift of their positions when viewed from widely separated  positions of the earth in its orbit was one of the most refined  operations of the observatory. The great precision with which this  minute angular quantity, a fraction of a second only, had to be  measured, was so delicate an operation with the ordinary micrometer,  though, indeed, it was with this instrument that the classical  observations of Sir Robert Ball were made, that a special instrument,  in which the measures were made by moving the two halves of a divided  object glass, known as a heliometer, had been pressed into this  service, and quite recently, in the skillful hands of Dr. Gill and Dr.  Elkin, had largely increased our knowledge in this direction. It was  obvious that photography might be here of great service, if we could  rely upon measurements of photographs of the same stars taken at  suitable intervals of time. Professor Pritchard, to whom was due the  honor of having opened this new path, aided by his assistants, had  proved by elaborate investigations that measures for parallax might be  safely made upon photographic plates, with, of course, the advantages  of leisure and repetition; and he had already by this method  determined the parallax for twenty-one stars with an accuracy not  inferior to that of values previously obtained by purely astronomical  methods.      PHOTOGRAPHIC REVELATIONS.    The remarkable successes of astronomical photography, which depended  upon the plate's power of accumulation of a very feeble light acting  continuously through an exposure of several hours, were worthy to be  regarded as a new revelation. The first chapter opened when, in 1880,  Dr. Henry Draper obtained a picture of the nebula of Orion; but a more  important advance was made in 1883, when Dr. Common, by his  photographs, brought to our knowledge details and extensions of this  nebula hitherto unknown. A further disclosure took place in 1885, when  the Brothers Henry showed for the first time in great detail the  spiral nebulosity issuing from the bright star Maia of the Pleiades,  and shortly afterward nebulous streams about the other stars of this  group. In 1886 Mr. Roberts, by means of a photograph to which three  hours' exposure had been given, showed the whole background of this  group to be nebulous.    In the following year Mr. Roberts more than doubled for us the great  extension of the nebular region which surrounds the trapezium in the  constellation of Orion. By his photographs of the great nebula in  Andromeda, he had shown the true significance of the dark canals which  had been seen by the eye. They were in reality spaces between  successive rings of bright matter, which appeared nearly straight,  owing to the inclination in which they lay relatively to us. These  bright rings surrounded an undefined central luminous mass. Recent  photographs by Mr. Russell showed that the great rift in the Milky Way  in Argus, which to the eye was void of stars, was in reality uniformly  covered with them.      THE STORY OF THE HEAVENS.    The heavens were richly but very irregularly inwrought with stars. The  brighter stars clustered into well known groups upon a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#20)"],[1,". Next year, in 1870,  Bouverie's Act passed, and Froude was one of the first to take  advantage of it by becoming again, what he had really never ceased  to be, a layman. As he did not enter the House of Commons, it is  idle to speculate on what might have been his political career.  Probably it would have been undistinguished. He was not a good  speaker, and he was a bad party man. His butler, who had been long  with him, and knew him well, was once asked by a canvassing agent  what his master's politics were. \"Well,\" he said reflectively, \"when  the Liberals are in, Mr. Froude is sometimes a Conservative. When  the Conservatives are in, Mr. Froude is always a Liberal.\" His own  master, Carlyle, had been in early life an ardent reformer, and had  hoped great things from the Act of 1832. Perhaps he did not know  very clearly what he expected. At any rate he was disappointed, and,  though he wrote an enthusiastic letter to Peel alter the abolition  of the Corn Laws, he regarded the Reform Act of 1867 with indignant  disgust.    Froude had a fitful and uncertain admiration for Disraeli. Gladstone  he never liked or trusted, and did not take the trouble to  understand. He had been brought up to despise oratory, he had caught  from Carlyle a horror of democracy, he disliked the Anglo-Catholic  party in the Church of England, and Gladstone's financial genius was  out of his line. The Liberal Government of 1868 was in his opinion  criminally indifferent to the Colonies. An earnest advocate of  Federation, he did not see that the best way of retaining colonial  loyalty was to preserve colonial independence intact. Nevertheless  Froude was a pioneer of the modern movement, still in progress, for  a closer union with the scattered parts of the British Empire. He  feared that the Colonies would go if some effort were not made to  retain them, and he turned over in his mind the various means of  building up a federal system. Although Canadian Federation was  emphatically Canadian in its origin, and had been adopted in  principle by Cardwell during the Government of Lord Russell, it was  Lord Carnarvon who carried it out, and he had no warmer supporter  than Froude.    Of Froude's favourite recreations at this time the best account is  to be found in his two Short Studies on A Fortnight in Kerry. From  1868 to 1870 he rented from Lord Lansdowne a place called Derreen,  thirty-six miles from Killarney, and seventeen from Kenmare, where  he spent the best part of the summer and autumn. If Froude did not  altogether understand the Irish people, at least the Irish  Catholics, and had no sympathy with their political aspirations, he  loved their humour, and the scenery of \"the most beautiful island in  the world\" had been familiar to him from his early manhood. In one  of his youthful rambles he had been struck down by small-pox, and  nursed with a devotion which he never forgot. Yet between him and  the Celt, as between him and the Catholic, there was a mysterious,  impassable barrier. They had not the same fundamental ideas of right  and wrong. They did not in very truth worship the same God. But of  Froude and the Irish I shall have to speak more at length hereafter.  In Kerry he enjoyed himself, while at the same time he finished his  History of England, and his description of the country is  enchanting.    \"A glance out of the window in the morning showed that I had not  overrated the general charm of the situation. The colours were  unlike those of any mountain scenery to which I was accustomed  elsewhere. The temperature is many degrees higher than that of the  Scotch highlands. The Gulf Stream impinges full upon the mouths of  its long bays. Every tide carries the flood of warm water forty  miles inland, and the vegetation consequently is rarely or never  checked by frost even two thousand feet above the sea-level. Thus  the mountains have a greenness altogether peculiar, stretches of  grass as rich as water-meadows reaching between the crags and  precipices to the very summits. The rock, chiefly old red sandstone,  is purple. The heather, of which there are enormous masses, is in  many places waist deep.\" Yachting and fishing, fishing and yachting,  were the staple amusements at Derreen. Nothing was more  characteristic of Froude than his love of the sea and the open air.  Sport, in the proper sense of the term, he also loved. \"I always  consider,\" he said, \"that the proudest moment of my life was, when  sliding down a shale heap, I got a right and left at woodcocks.\" For  luxurious modes of making big bags with little trouble he never  cared at all. But let him once more explain himself in his own  words. \"I delight in a mountain walk when I must work hard for my  five brace of grouse. I see no amusement in dawdling over a lowland  moor where the packs are as thick as chickens in a poultry-yard. I  like better than most things a day with my own dogs in scattered  covers, when I know not what may rise--a woodcock, an odd pheasant,  a snipe in the out-lying willow-bed, and perhaps a mallard or a  teal. A hare or two falls in agreeably when the mistress of the  house takes an interest in the bag. I detest battues and hot  corners, and slaughter for slaughter's sake. I wish every tenant in  England had his share in amusements which in moderation are good for  us all, and was allowed to shoot such birds or beasts as were bred  on his own farm, any clause in his lease to the contrary  notwithstanding.\" Considering that this passage was written ten  years before the Ground Game Act, it must be admitted that the  sentiment is remarkably liberal. The chief interest of these  papers,* however, is not political, but personal. They show what  Froude's natural tastes were, the tastes of a sportsman and a  country gentleman. He had long outgrown the weakness of his boyhood,  and his physical health was robust. With a firm foot and a strong  head he walked freely over cliffs where a false step would have  meant a fall of a thousand feet. No man of letters was ever more  devoted to exercise and sport. Though subject, like most men, and  all editors, to fits of despondency, he had a sound mind in a  healthy frame, and his pessimism was purely theoretical.    --  * Short Studies, vol. ii. pp. 217-308.  --    Froude's History, the great work of his life, was completed in 1870.  He deliberately chose, after the twelve volumes, to leave Elizabeth  at the height of her power, mistress of the seas, with Spain crushed  at her feet. As he says himself, in the opening paragraph of his own  Conclusion, \"Chess-players, when they have brought their game to a  point at which the result can be foreseen with certainty, regard  their contest as ended, and sweep the pieces from the board.\" Froude  had accomplished his purpose. He had rewritten the story of the  Reformation. He had proved that the Church of England, though in a  sense it dated from St. Austin of Canterbury, became under Henry  VIII. a self-contained institution, independent of Rome and subject  to the supremacy of the Crown.    Elizabeth altered the form of words in which her father had  expressed his ecclesiastical authority; but the substance was in  both cases the same. The sovereign was everything. The Bishop of  Rome was nothing. There has never been in the Church of England  since the divorce of Katharine any power to make a Bishop without  the authority of the Crown, or to change a doctrine without the  authority of Parliament, nor has any layman been legally subject to  temporal punishment by the ecclesiastical courts. Convocation cannot  touch an article or a formulary. King, Lords, and Commons can make  new formularies or abolish the old. The laity owe no allegiance to  the Canons, and in every theological suit the final appeal is to the  King in Council, now the Judicial Committee. Since the accession of  Elizabeth divine service has been performed in English, and the  English Bible has been open to every one who can read. Yet there are  people who talk as if the Reformation meant nothing, was nothing,  never occurred at all. This theory, like the shallow sentimentalism  which made an innocent saint and martyr of Mary Stuart, has never  recovered from the crushing onslaught of Froude.    Mr. Swinburne in the Encyclopaedia Britannica reduces the latter  theory to an absurdity, by demonstrating that if Mary was innocent  she was a fool. In his defence of Elizabeth Froude stops short of  many admirers. He was disgusted by her feminine weakness for  masculine flattery; he dwells with almost tedious minuteness upon  her smallest intrigues; he exposes her parsimonious ingratitude to  her dauntless and unrivalled seamen. Yet for all that he brings out  the vital difference between her and Mary Tudor, between the  Protestant and Catholic systems of government. Elizabeth boasted,  and boasted truly, that she did not persecute opinion. If people  were good citizens and loyal subjects, it was all the same to her  whether they went to church or to mass. Had it been possible to  adopt and apply in the sixteenth century the modern doctrine of  contemptuous indifference to sectarian quarrels, there was not one  of her subjects more capable of appreciating and acting upon it than  the great Queen herself. But in that case she would have estranged  her friends without conciliating her opponents. She would have  forfeited her throne and her life. Pius V. had not merely  excommunicated her, which was a barren and ineffective threat, a  telum imbelle sine ictu; he had also purported to depose her as a  heretic, and to release her subjects from the duty of allegiance.  Another Vicar of Christ, Gregory XIII., went farther. He intimated,  not obscurely, that whosoever removed such a monster from the world  would be doing God's service. This at least was no idle menace.  Those great leaders of Protestantism in Europe, Coligny, Murray,  William the Silent, were successively murdered within a few "]]]
