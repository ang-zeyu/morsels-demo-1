Fissure veins are generally in positions of this kind, formed and filled  in a similar manner, but with the various metallic ores. Passing further  west a short distance we reach the Passaic River, and walk along its  banks for a mile north to the Belleville bridge; at this point is the  intake of the Jersey City water works, with their huge Worthington pumps  and other accessories, which may be conveniently visited. The Passaic  River is then crossed, and the train on the Newark and Paterson road may  be taken for three miles to Avondale, from whence it is two miles east  to the Belleville sandstone quarries, or the bank of the Passaic may be  followed and the quarries reached in an hour from Belleville. Here again  are met the sandstones and shales, besides another and larger fault, and  many interesting features of the sandstone and its quarrying may be  examined. The railroad station having been regained, Paterson is the  next point of interest. The first thing noticeable in approaching the  city are the quarries in the side of the hills to the south, and these  may be visited the first; they are but a short distance southeast of the  station. Here the sandstone will be found in contact with the trap above  and the layers of basalt, trap, tufa, sandstone, shales and  conglomerates are exposed. Regaining the nearest railroad track (the  Boonton branch of the D., L. & W.R.R.), this is followed for some  distance west, when the various strata can be examined in the cut of the  railroad and a fault of nearly sixty feet in the trap; this is noticed  as a depression in the face of the cliff, and it may be seen by the  superposition of the layers of trap and basalt. Where the fault occurs a  short distance further west, there is another smaller fault. A visit to  the Great Falls of the Passaic is a very pleasurable diversion at this  point, and these are about a half mile north of this locality. Here the  arrangement of the trap and sandstones can be again profitably studied,  and the mineralogical localities which I have described in a former one  of these articles[2] examined, not omitting the one at West Paterson,  wherein so much phrenite may be found. Taking the train from West  Paterson to Little Falls, a walk of a few miles south brings us to the  Little Falls, and here is another interesting locality wherein the  contact of the sandstone and trap may be examined and the numerous  additional phenomena studied. A quarry near the Falls is the best point  in which to find these exposures, and from the viaduct crossing the  river an excellent view of the surrounding country may be obtained.  Regaining the train, Montville is soon reached and visited, and after  this, if time sufficient Boonville, two miles west, may be taken in, or  it may be necessary to go there to catch a return train, as but few stop  at Montville. At Boonton there are many interesting features--iron works  furnaces, localities in which fossil remains are found, footprints,  conglomeritic beds, and many other things, of which I will endeavor to  give a detailed account in some other of this series of articles.    [Footnote 1: See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 363.]    [Footnote 2: See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 363.]           *       *       *       *       *          DISCOVERY OF ANCIENT CHURCH IN JERUSALEM.      An account of the newly discovered church, north of the Damascus Gate,  Jerusalem, appears in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine  Exploration Fund. The author is Dr. Selah Merrill. The ruin has proved  to be one of great extent, and of special interest. The way in which it  was brought to light is worth recording. In an uneven field, which rose  considerably above the land about it, parts of which appearing, indeed,  like little hillocks, the owner of the soil tried to maintain a  vegetable garden, but the ground was so dry that neither grain nor  vegetables would flourish, and even irrigation did little or no good;  besides, here and there large holes appeared in the ground which could  not be accounted for. At last the owner determined to dig and see what  there was below the surface of his field, and to his surprise he very  soon came upon fine walls and a pavement. The excavations being followed  up have laid bare a church with some of the surrounding buildings. The  amount of _debris_ which had accumulated above the floor of these  buildings was 10 to 20 feet in depth. To remove this mass of earth has  required much time and labor, and the work is not yet completed. The  piece of ground in question has about 60 yards of frontage on the main  road, and extends, so far as the excavations go, about the same distance  back from the road, that is, to the east.    The church itself is situated on the south side of this plot, and is  very near the street. The ground in front of the church is paved with  fine slabs of stone. The steps by which the church was entered were 5  feet wide, but the doorway itself was somewhat wider. From the entrance  to the altar step, or platform, the distance is 55 feet, and from that  point to the back of the apse 15 feet 6 inches; the width of the apse is  16 feet 6 inches. The width of the church is 24 feet 6 inches. Nine feet  in front of the altar step a wall has been thrown across the church in a  manner similar to that in the church of the Nativity at Bethlehem. This  wall, also those of the church, of which several courses remain, and the  interior of the apse, show that the building was originally painted, and  some of the figures and designs can still be traced. At the southeast  corner of the church, leading from the apse, there is a narrow but well  built passageway to the buildings in the rear. The character of these  buildings is not very evident; certainly they did not stand on a line  with the church, but at an angle of 25 deg. with that line. Between the  church and what appears now to have been the main building in the rear,  there was a passage not over 3 feet wide. The main building in the rear  of the church is 47 feet 6 inches long, but to this must be added 20  feet more of a special room, which seems to have belonged to it, and  which had a beautiful mosaic pavement. Thus the extreme length from the  entrance of the church to the (present) east side of this mosaic floor  is 140 feet.    On the west side of this mosaic floor, where it joins the wall of the  main building, there is a threshold of a single stone, 9 feet 6 inches  long, with a step 6 feet 9 inches in the clear. This is considerably  wider, it will be seen, than the steps, and even the entrance of the  church. Several patches of mosaic pavement have been found, but in one  place two or three square yards have been preserved, enough to show that  the work was extremely beautiful. The colored tracings resemble those in  the church on the Mount of Olives, and on one side are the large Greek  letters [Theta][epsilon][omicron][nu]. North of this mosaic floor, and  of the main building which joins it, and running alongside of both,  there is a watercourse or channel cut in the solid rock, which has been  leveled to accommodate the buildings above. This can be traced in an  east and west line for a distance of 37 feet; it is 2 feet 3 inches  deep, 20 inches wide at the top and 12 at the bottom. From about the  middle of the mosaic floor this channel turns a right angle and runs 20  feet or more to the north; it is possible that it led _from_ the north,  and at the point indicated turned a right angle and ran to the west.  Piles of stones and _debris_ prevent us at present from deciding as to  the length of the channel or where it comes from. In the bank of  _debris_, which rises on the east side of the mosaic floor to a height  of 20 feet, there is, about 6 feet above the floor, a watercourse formed  of cement, running north and south at right angles to the line of the  church and the other buildings, which must have belonged to a much later  period. In fact--and this is an interesting circumstance--the mosaic  pavement appears to extend under and beyond this canal and the mass of  _debris_ which is yet to be removed.    In the northwest corner of the room, where the mosaic floor is found,  very near the angle (already mentioned) of the rock-cut channel, there  is a tomb about 6 feet below the surface or level of the floor. The tomb  is 10 feet long and 9 feet wide, and is entered by a doorway 26 inches  wide, which is well built, and in the sides of which are grooves for a  door to slide up and down. On the wall of the tomb at the east end there  is a raised Greek cross, 22 inches long and 13 inches wide. One cannot  stand erect in its highest part, but it is to be considered that the  loculi are two-thirds full of _debris_, composed chiefly of decayed  bones and bits of glass. Those in charge of the excavations have not, up  to the present time, allowed the tombs to be cleared out. The loculi are  2 feet in depth.    What Captain Conder speaks of as \"vaults north of the church,\" turn out  to be the tops of houses. They are four in number, each 75 feet long by  28 feet wide, and faced the street. They were divided (one or two of  them at least) into apartments by means of arches. The lower courses of  the walls, to the height of several feet, are of squared stones, while  the upper portions and the roofs are of rubble work, which was covered  with a heavy coating of plaster. The threshold of one has been exposed,  which is 6 feet in the clear, and the sides of the doorway show  excellent work.    Among the ruins there are two sections of marble columns, each 33 inches  in diameter. Three large cisterns have been found, two of which were  nearly full of water; the mouths of these, which were closed, were many  feet below the surface of the ground before the excavations began, hence  no one knows how old the water in them may be. Some of the slabs with  which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#20)"],[1," strong position on the Baltic, are the goals to which the European  policy of Russia has naturally long been directed. She feels herself,  also, the leading power of the Slavonic races, and has for many years  been busy in encouraging and extending the spread of this element into  Central Europe.    Pan-Slavism is still hard at work.    It is hard to foresee how soon Russia will come out from her retirement  and again tread the natural paths of her international policy. Her  present political attitude depends considerably on the person of the  present Emperor, who believes in the need of leaning upon a strong  monarchical State, such as Germany is, and also on the character of the  internal development of the mighty Empire. The whole body of the nation  is so tainted with revolutionary and moral infection, and the peasantry  is plunged in such economic disorder, that it is difficult to see from  what elements a vivifying force may spring up capable of restoring a  healthy condition. Even the agrarian policy of the present Government  has not produced any favourable results, and has so far disappointed  expectations. The possibility thus has always existed that, under the  stress of internal affairs, the foreign policy may be reversed and an  attempt made to surmount the difficulties at home by successes abroad.  Time and events will decide whether these successes will be sought in  the Far East or in the West. On the one side Japan, and possibly China,  must be encountered; on the other, Germany, Austria, and, possibly,  Turkey.    Doubtless these conditions must exercise a decisive influence on the  Franco-Russian Alliance. The interests of the two allies are not  identical. While France aims solely at crushing Germany by an aggressive  war, Russia from the first has more defensive schemes in view. She  wished to secure herself against any interference by the Powers of  Central Europe in the execution of her political plans in the South and  East, and at the same time, at the price of an alliance, to raise, on  advantageous terms in France, the loans which were so much needed.  Russia at present has no inducement to seek an aggressive war with  Germany or to take part in one. Of course, every further increase of the  German power militates against the Russian interests. We shall therefore  always find her on the side of those who try to cross our political paths.    England has recently associated herself with the Franco-Russian  Alliance. She has made an arrangement in Asia with Russia by which the  spheres of influence of the two parties are delimited, while with France  she has come to terms in the clear intention of suppressing Germany  under all circumstances, if necessary by force of arms.    The actually existing conflict of Russian and English interests in the  heart of Asia can obviously not be terminated by such agreements. So,  also, no natural community of interests exists between England and  France. A strong French fleet may be as great a menace to England as to  any other Power. For the present, however, we may reckon on an  Anglo--French _entente_. This union is cemented by the common hostility  to Germany. No other reason for the political combination of the two  States is forthcoming. There is not even a credible pretext, which might  mask the real objects.    This policy of England is, on superficial examination, not very  comprehensible. Of course, German industries and trade have lately made  astounding progress, and the German navy is growing to a strength which  commands respect. We are certainly a hindrance to the plans which  England is prosecuting in Asiatic Turkey and Central Africa. This may  well be distasteful to the English from economic as well as political  and military aspects. But, on the other hand, the American competition  in the domain of commercial politics is far keener than the German. The  American navy is at the present moment stronger than the German, and  will henceforth maintain this precedence. Even the French are on the  point of building a formidable fleet, and their colonial Empire, so far  as territory is concerned, is immensely superior to ours. Yet, in spite  of all these considerations, the hostility of the English is primarily  directed against us. It is necessary to adopt the English standpoint in  order to understand the line of thought which guides the English  politicians. I believe that the solution of the problem is to be found  in the wide ramifications of English interests in every part of the  world.    Since England committed the unpardonable blunder, from her point of  view, of not supporting the Southern States in the American War of  Secession, a rival to England's world-wide Empire has appeared on the  other side of the Atlantic in the form of the United States of North  America, which are a grave menace to England's fortunes. The keenest  competition conceivable now exists between the two countries. The  annexation of the Philippines by America, and England's treaty with  Japan, have accentuated the conflict of interests between the two  nations. The trade and industries of America can no longer be checked,  and the absolutely inexhaustible and ever-growing resources of the Union  are so prodigious that a naval war with America, in view of the vast  distances and wide extent of the enemies' coasts, would prove a very  bold, and certainly very difficult, undertaking. England accordingly has  always diplomatically conceded the claims of America, as quite recently  in the negotiations about fortifying the Panama Canal; the object  clearly is to avoid any collision with the United States, from fearing  the consequences of such collision. The American competition in trade  and industries, and the growth of the American navy, are tolerated as  inevitable, and the community of race is borne in mind. In this sense,  according to the English point of view, must be understood the treaty by  which a Court of Arbitration between the two countries was established.    England wishes, in any case, to avert the danger of a war with America.  The natural opposition of the two rival States may, however, in the  further development of things, be so accentuated that England will be  forced to assert her position by arms, or at least to maintain an  undisputed naval supremacy, in order to emphasize her diplomatic action.  The relations of the two countries to Canada may easily become strained  to a dangerous point, and the temporary failure of the Arbitration  Treaty casts a strong light on the fact that the American people does not  consider that the present political relations of the two nations are  permanent.    There is another danger which concerns England more closely and directly  threatens her vitality. This is due to the nationalist movement in India  and Egypt, to the growing power of Islam, to the agitation for  independence in the great colonies, as well as to the supremacy of the  Low-German element in South Africa.    Turkey is the only State which might seriously threaten the English  position in Egypt by land. This contingency gives to the national  movement in Egypt an importance which it would not otherwise possess; it  clearly shows that England intensely fears every Pan-Islamitic movement.  She is trying with all the resources of political intrigue to undermine  the growing power of Turkey, which she officially pretends to support,  and is endeavouring to create in Arabia a new religious centre in  opposition to the Caliphate.    The same views are partially responsible for the policy in India, where  some seventy millions of Moslems live under the English rule. England,  so far, in accordance with the principle of _divide et impera_, has  attempted to play off the Mohammedan against the Hindu population. But  now that a pronounced revolutionary and nationalist tendency shows  itself among these latter, the danger is imminent that Pan-Islamism,  thoroughly roused, should unite with the revolutionary elements of  Bengal. The co-operation of these elements might create a very grave  danger, capable of shaking the foundations of England's high position in  the world.    While so many dangers, in the future at least, threaten both at home and  abroad, English imperialism has failed to link the vast Empire together,  either for purposes of commerce or defence, more closely than hitherto.  Mr. Chamberlain's dream of the British Imperial Customs Union has  definitely been abandoned. No attempt was made at the Imperial  Conference in 1911 to go back to it. \"A centrifugal policy predominated.  .... When the question of imperial defence came up, the policy was  rejected which wished to assure to Great Britain the help of the oversea  dominions in every imaginable eventuality.\" The great self-ruled  colonies represent allies, who will stand by England in the hour of  need, but \"allies with the reservation that they are not to be employed  wrongfully for objects which they cannot ascertain or do not  approve.\" [A] There are clear indications that the policy of the  dominions, though not yet planning a separation from England, is  contemplating the future prospect of doing so. Canada, South Africa, and  Australia are developing, as mentioned in Chapter IV., into independent  nations and States, and will, when their time comes, claim formal  independence.    [Footnote A: Th. Schiemann in the _Kreuzzeitung_ of July 5, 1911.]    All these circumstances constitute a grave menace to the stability of  England's Empire, and these dangers largely influence England's attitude  towards Germany.    England may have to tolerate the rivalry of North America in her  imperial and commercial ambitions, but the competition of Germany must  be stopped. If England is forced to fight America, the German fleet must  not be in a position to help the Americans. Therefore it must be  destroyed.    A similar line of thought is suggested by the eventuality of a"]]]
