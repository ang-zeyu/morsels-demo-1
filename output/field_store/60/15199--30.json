Resounding smacks mingled with hoarse bellows of fury and  pain. Andrews flopped here and there, trying to arise, but every time  the heavy knotted halter beat him down.    Presently Steele stopped. Andrews rose right in front of the Ranger, and  there, like the madman he was, he went for his gun.    But it scarcely leaped from its holster when Steele's swift hand  intercepted it. Steele clutched Andrews' arm.    Then came a wrench, a cracking of bones, a scream of agony.    The gun dropped into the dust; and in a moment of wrestling fury  Andrews, broken, beaten down, just able to moan, lay beside it.    Steele, so cool and dark for a man who had acted with such passionate  swiftness, faced the others as if to dare them to move. They neither  moved nor spoke, and then he strode away.    Miss Sampson did not speak a word while we were riding the rest of the  way home, but she was strangely white of face and dark of eye. Sally  could not speak fast enough to say all she felt.    And I, of course, had my measure of feelings. One of them was that as  sure as the sun rose and set it was written that Diane Sampson was to  love Vaughn Steele.    I could not read her mind, but I had a mind of my own.    How could any woman, seeing this maligned and menaced Ranger, whose  life was in danger every moment he spent on the streets, in the light of  his action on behalf of a poor little beast, help but wonder and brood  over the magnificent height he might reach if he had love--passion--a  woman for his inspiration?    It was the day after this incident that, as Sally, Diane, and I were  riding homeward on the road from Sampson, I caught sight of a group of  dark horses and riders swiftly catching up with us.    We were on the main road, in plain sight of town and passing by ranches;  nevertheless, I did not like the looks of the horsemen and grew uneasy.  Still, I scarcely thought it needful to race our horses just to reach  town a little ahead of these strangers.    Accordingly, they soon caught up with us.    They were five in number, all dark-faced except one, dark-clad and  superbly mounted on dark bays and blacks. They had no pack animals and,  for that matter, carried no packs at all.    Four of them, at a swinging canter, passed us, and the fifth pulled his  horse to suit our pace and fell in between Sally and me.    \"Good day,\" he said pleasantly to me. \"Don't mind my ridin' in with  you-all, I hope?\"    Considering his pleasant approach, I could not but be civil.    He was a singularly handsome fellow, at a quick glance, under forty  years, with curly, blond hair, almost gold, a skin very fair for that  country, and the keenest, clearest, boldest blue eyes I had ever seen in  a man.    \"You're Russ, I reckon,\" he said. \"Some of my men have seen you ridin'  round with Sampson's girls. I'm Jack Blome.\"    He did not speak that name with any flaunt or flourish. He merely stated  it.    Blome, the rustler! I grew tight all over.    Still, manifestly there was nothing for me to do but return his  pleasantry. I really felt less uneasiness after he had made himself  known to me. And without any awkwardness, I introduced him to the girls.    He took off his sombrero and made gallant bows to both.    Miss Sampson had heard of him and his record, and she could not help a  paleness, a shrinking, which, however, he did not appear to notice.  Sally had been dying to meet a real rustler, and here he was, a very  prince of rascals.    But I gathered that she would require a little time before she could be  natural. Blome seemed to have more of an eye for Sally than for Diane.  \"Do you like Pecos?\" he asked Sally.    \"Out here? Oh, yes, indeed!\" she replied.    \"Like ridin'?\"    \"I love horses.\"    Like almost every man who made Sally's acquaintance, he hit upon the  subject best calculated to make her interesting to free-riding, outdoor  Western men.    That he loved a thoroughbred horse himself was plain. He spoke naturally  to Sally with interest, just as I had upon first meeting her, and he  might not have been Jack Blome, for all the indication he gave of the  fact in his talk.    But the look of the man was different. He was a desperado, one of the  dashing, reckless kind--more famous along the Pecos and Rio Grande than  more really desperate men. His attire proclaimed a vanity seldom seen in  any Westerner except of that unusual brand, yet it was neither gaudy or  showy.    One had to be close to Blome to see the silk, the velvet, the gold, the  fine leather. When I envied a man's spurs then they were indeed worth  coveting.    Blome had a short rifle and a gun in saddle-sheaths. My sharp eye,  running over him, caught a row of notches on the bone handle of the big  Colt he packed.    It was then that the marshal, the Ranger in me, went hot under the  collar. The custom that desperadoes and gun-fighters had of cutting a  notch on their guns for every man killed was one of which the mere  mention made my gorge rise.    At the edge of town Blome doffed his sombrero again, said \"_Adios_,\" and  rode on ahead of us. And it was then I was hard put to it to keep track  of the queries, exclamations, and other wild talk of two very much  excited young ladies. I wanted to think; I _needed_ to think.    \"Wasn't he lovely? Oh, I could adore him!\" rapturously uttered Miss  Sally Langdon several times, to my ultimate disgust.    Also, after Blome had ridden out of sight, Miss Sampson lost the evident  effect of his sinister presence, and she joined Miss Langdon in paying  the rustler compliments, too. Perhaps my irritation was an indication of  the quick and subtle shifting of my mind to harsher thought.    \"Jack Blome!\" I broke in upon their adulations. \"Rustler and gunman. Did  you see the notches on his gun? Every notch for a man he's killed! For  weeks reports have come to Linrock that soon as he could get round to it  he'd ride down and rid the community of that bothersome fellow, that  Texas Ranger! He's come to kill Vaughn Steele!\"          Chapter 7    DIANE AND VAUGHN      Then as gloom descended on me with my uttered thought, my heart smote me  at Sally's broken: \"Oh, Russ! No! No!\" Diane Sampson bent dark, shocked  eyes upon the hill and ranch in front of her; but they were sightless,  they looked into space and eternity, and in them I read the truth  suddenly and cruelly revealed to her--she loved Steele!    I found it impossible to leave Miss Sampson with the impression I had  given. My own mood fitted a kind of ruthless pleasure in seeing her  suffer through love as I had intimation I was to suffer.    But now, when my strange desire that she should love Steele had its  fulfilment, and my fiendish subtleties to that end had been crowned with  success, I was confounded in pity and the enormity of my crime. For it  had been a crime to make, or help to make, this noble and beautiful  woman love a Ranger, the enemy of her father, and surely the author of  her coming misery. I felt shocked at my work. I tried to hang an excuse  on my old motive that through her love we might all be saved. When it  was too late, however, I found that this motive was wrong and perhaps  without warrant.    We rode home in silence. Miss Sampson, contrary to her usual custom of  riding to the corrals or the porch, dismounted at a path leading in  among the trees and flowers. \"I want to rest, to think before I go in,\"  she said.    Sally accompanied me to the corrals. As our horses stopped at the gate I  turned to find confirmation of my fears in Sally's wet eyes.    \"Russ,\" she said, \"it's worse than we thought.\"    \"Worse? I should say so,\" I replied.    \"It'll about kill her. She never cared that way for any man. When the  Sampson women love, they love.\"    \"Well, you're lucky to be a Langdon,\" I retorted bitterly.    \"I'm Sampson enough to be unhappy,\" she flashed back at me, \"and I'm  Langdon enough to have some sense. You haven't any sense or kindness,  either. Why'd you want to blurt out that Jack Blome was here to kill  Steele?\"    \"I'm ashamed, Sally,\" I returned, with hanging head. \"I've been a brute.  I've wanted her to love Steele. I thought I had a reason, but now it  seems silly. Just now I wanted to see how much she did care.    \"Sally, the other day you said misery loved company. That's the trouble.  I'm sore--bitter. I'm like a sick coyote that snaps at everything. I've  wanted you to go into the very depths of despair. But I couldn't send  you. So I took out my spite on poor Miss Sampson. It was a damn unmanly  thing for me to do.\"    \"Oh, it's not so bad as all that. But you might have been less abrupt.  Russ, you seem to take an--an awful tragic view of your--your own case.\"    \"Tragic? Hah!\" I cried like the villain in the play. \"What other way  could I look at it? I tell you I love you so I can't sleep or do  anything.\"    \"That's not tragic. When you've no chance, _then_ that's tragic.\"    Sally, as swiftly as she had blushed, could change into that deadly  sweet mood. She did both now. She seemed warm, softened, agitated. How  could this be anything but sincere? I felt myself slipping; so I laughed  harshly.    \"Chance! I've no chance on earth.\"    \"Try!\" she whispered.    But I caught myself in time. Then the shock of bitter renunciation made  it easy for me to simulate anger.    \"You promised not to--not to--\" I began, choking. My voice was hoarse  and it broke, matters surely far removed from pretense.    I had seen Sally Langdon in varying degrees of emotion, but never as she  appeared now. She was pale and she trembled a little. If it was not  fright, then I could not tell what it was. But there were contrition and  earnestness about her, too.    \"Russ, I know. I promised not to--to tease--to tempt you anymore,\" she  faltered. \"I've broken it. I'm ashamed. I haven't played the game  square. But I couldn't--I can't help myself. I've got sense enough not  to engage myself to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#20)"],[1," tastes on both sides. But such a system, however well it worked in  practice for the production of a reliable fighting machine, was not  calculated to train the Indians to protect themselves.    That nothing was done to open up a military career to the  Western-educated classes was not at first more than a sentimental  grievance. But when the years passed and they still waited for that  larger share in the government and even in the administration of their  country to which the British Parliament had recognised their claim as  far back as the Act of 1833, their faith even in the professed purpose  of British rule began to waver. At first the leaders of the Indian  _intelligentsia_, some of whom had learned the value of British  institutions and of the freedom of British public life, not merely  through English literature but through years of actual residence in  England, preferred to hold the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy alone or chiefly  responsible for the long delay in the fulfilment of hopes which they in  fact regarded as rights. Their confidence in British statesmanship and  in the British Parliament remained unshaken for nearly thirty years  after the Mutiny, though they were perhaps not unnaturally inclined to  put their trust chiefly in the Liberal party which had been most closely  associated with the promotion of a progressive policy towards India in  the past. Lord Lytton's Viceroyalty confirmed them in the belief that  from the Conservative party they had little to hope for, and his drastic  Press Act of 1879, though not unprovoked by the virulent abuse of  Government in some of the vernacular papers and the reckless  dissemination of alarmist rumours during the worst period of the Afghan  troubles, was held to foreshadow a return all along the line to purely  despotic methods of government. But his departure from India after Lord  Beaconsfield's defeat at the general election of 1880 and the return of  the Liberal party to power quickened new hopes which Lord Ripon, when he  became Viceroy in succession to Lord Lytton, showed every disposition to  justify.    All the greater was the disillusionment when a measure, introduced for  the purpose of abolishing \"judicial disqualifications based on race  distinctions,\" not only provoked fierce opposition amongst the whole  European community and even amongst the rank and file of the civil  service, but was ultimately whittled down in deference to that  opposition until the very principle at issue was virtually surrendered.  Indians resented this fresh assertion of racial superiority, and saw in  the violence of the agitation, sometimes not far removed from threats of  actual lawlessness, and in the personal abuse poured out by his own  countrymen on the Queen's representative, the survival amongst a large  section of Europeans of the same hatred that had invented for a Viceroy  who was determined to temper justice with mercy after the Mutiny the  scornful nickname of \"Clemency Canning.\"    The fate of the Ilbert Bill taught the Indians above all one practical  lesson--the potency of agitation. If by agitation a Viceroy enjoying the  full confidence of the British Government, with a powerful  Parliamentary majority behind it, could be compelled by the British  community in India, largely consisting of public servants, to surrender  a great principle of policy, then the only hope for Indians was to learn  to agitate in their own interests, and to create a political  organisation of their own in order both to educate public opinion in  India and influence public opinion in England. The men who started the  Indian National Congress were inspired by no revolutionary ambitions.  Though they did not talk, as Mr. Gandhi does to-day, about producing a  \"change of hearts\" in their British rulers, that was their purpose and  unlike Mr. Gandhi, they were firm believers not in any racial  superiority, but in the superiority of Western civilisation and of  British political institutions which they deemed not incapable of  transplantation on to Indian soil. So on December 28, 1885, a small band  of Indian gentlemen, who represented the _elite_ of the Western-educated  classes, met in Bombay to hold the first session of the Indian National  Congress which, with all its many shortcomings, even in its earlier and  better days, was destined to play a far more important part than was for  a long time realised by Englishmen in India or at home. Many of  them--such as Mr. Bonnerji, a distinguished Bengalee, Pherozeshah Mehta,  a rising member of the great Parsee community in Bombay, Dadabhai  Naoroji, who was later on to be the first Indian to put forward plainly  India's claim to self-government within the British Empire--had spent  several years in England. Others, like Ranade and Telang, had been for a  long time past vigorous advocates of Indian social reforms. With them  were a few Englishmen--chief among them a retired civilian Mr. Hume--who  were in complete sympathy with their aspirations. Only the Mahomedans  were unrepresented, though not uninvited, partly because few of them had  been caught up in the current of Western thought and education, and  partly because the community as a whole, reflecting the ancient and  deep-seated antagonism between Islam and Hinduism, distrusted  profoundly every movement in which Hindus were the leading spirits. Lord  Reay, who was then Governor of Bombay, was invited to preside and  declined only after asking for instructions from the Viceroy, Lord  Dufferin, who, though not unfriendly, held that it was undesirable for  the head of a Provincial Government to associate himself with what  should essentially be a popular movement. Mr. Bonnerji, who was selected  to take the chair, emphatically proclaimed the loyalty of the Congress  to the British Crown. Amongst the most characteristic resolutions moved  and carried was one demanding the appointment of a Royal Commission, on  which the people of India should be represented, to inquire into the  working of the Indian administration, and another pleading for a large  expansion of the Indian Legislative Councils and the creation of a  Standing Committee of the House of Commons to which the majority in  those Councils should have the right to appeal if overruled by the  Executive.    The Congress claimed to represent the educated opinion of India, and,  though Government withheld from it all official recognition, it  flattered itself not without reason that its preaching had not fallen on  to altogether barren soil when, still under Lord Dufferin's Viceroyalty,  the Indian Local Government Act of 1888 marked a large advance upon the  reforms in local and municipal institutions which, with the repeal of  the Lytton Press Act, had been amongst the few tangible results of Lord  Ripon's \"Pro-Indian\" Viceroyalty; for it fulfilled many of the demands  which Indian Liberals, and notably Pherozeshah Mehta, had urged for  years past for a more effective share in municipal administration. Still  greater was the satisfaction when, under Lord Lansdowne's Viceroyalty,  the British Parliament passed in 1892 an Indian Councils Act, for which  Lord Dufferin himself had paved the way by admitting that Government  could and should rely more largely upon the experience and advice of  responsible Indians. The functions and the constitution of both the  Viceroy's and the Provincial Legislative Councils, though their powers  remained purely consultative, were substantially enlarged by the  addition of a considerable number of unofficial members representing, at  least in theory, all classes and interests, who were given the right to  put questions to the Executive on matters of administration and, in the  case of the Viceroy's Council, to discuss the financial policy of  Government if and when the budget to be laid before it involved fresh  taxation. The Act of 1892 did not, however, admit \"the living forces of  the elective principle\" on which the Congress leaders had laid their  chief stress, and they went on pressing \"not for Consultative Councils,  but for representative institutions.\" Their hopes never perhaps rose so  high as when one of their own veterans, Dadabhai Naoroji--though Lord  Salisbury could not resist a jibe at the expense of the \"black  man\"--entered the House of Commons as Liberal member for Central  Finsbury. It must be conceded that, had Government at that time taken  the Congress by the hand instead of treating it with disdain and  suspicion, it might have played loyally and usefully a part analogous to  that of \"Her Majesty's Opposition\" at home--a part which Lord Dufferin  had been shrewd enough in the beginning not to dismiss as altogether  impossible or undesirable. Its claim to represent Indian opinion, as,  within certain limits, it unquestionably did, was ignored, and it was  left to drift without any attempt at official guidance into waters none  the less dangerous because they seemed shallow. It quickly attracted a  large following among the urban middle classes all over India. But as  the number of those who attended its annual sessions, held in turn in  every province, grew larger, it became less amenable to the guiding and  restraining influence of those who had created it, and especially of  those who had hoped to lead it in the path of social and religious  reform as well as of political advancement.    The social and religious reform movement which had been of great promise  before the Mutiny and for some years afterwards, when Keshab Chundra Sen  gave the Brahmo Somaj a fine uplift, slackened. Like the Brahmo Somaj in  Bengal, the Prirthana Somaj in Bombay no longer made so many or such  fervent recruits. New societies sprang up in defence of the old faiths,  some even glorifying all their primitive customs and superstitions, and  most of them, whilst professing to recognise the need for cleansing them  of their grosser accretions, displaying a marked reaction against the "]]]
