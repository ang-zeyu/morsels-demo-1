They went hand in hand, as  the old people had done when they were children; but not to the Round  Tower, or to Friedericksberg; no, the little damsel wound her arms round  the boy, and then they flew far away through all Denmark. And spring  came, and summer; and then it was autumn, and then winter; and a  thousand pictures were reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy;  and the little girl always sang to him, \"This you will never forget.\"  And during their whole flight the Elder Tree smelt so sweet and odorous;  he remarked the roses and the fresh beeches, but the Elder Tree had  a more wondrous fragrance, for its flowers hung on the breast of the  little maiden; and there, too, did he often lay his head during the  flight.    \"It is lovely here in spring!\" said the young maiden. And they stood in  a beech-wood that had just put on its first green, where the woodroof [*]  at their feet sent forth its fragrance, and the pale-red anemony looked  so pretty among the verdure. \"Oh, would it were always spring in the  sweetly-smelling Danish beech-forests!\"         * Asperula odorata.    \"It is lovely here in summer!\" said she. And she flew past old castles  of by-gone days of chivalry, where the red walls and the embattled  gables were mirrored in the canal, where the swans were swimming, and  peered up into the old cool avenues. In the fields the corn was waving  like the sea; in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing; while  wild-drone flowers, and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the  hedges; and towards evening the moon rose round and large, and the  haycocks in the meadows smelt so sweetly. \"This one never forgets!\"    \"It is lovely here in autumn!\" said the little maiden. And suddenly the  atmosphere grew as blue again as before; the forest grew red, and green,  and yellow-colored. The dogs came leaping along, and whole flocks of  wild-fowl flew over the cairn, where blackberry-bushes were hanging  round the old stones. The sea was dark blue, covered with ships full  of white sails; and in the barn old women, maidens, and children were  sitting picking hops into a large cask; the young sang songs, but the  old told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. Nothing could  be more charming.    \"It is delightful here in winter!\" said the little maiden. And all the  trees were covered with hoar-frost; they looked like white corals; the  snow crackled under foot, as if one had new boots on; and one falling  star after the other was seen in the sky. The Christmas-tree was lighted  in the room; presents were there, and good-humor reigned. In the country  the violin sounded in the room of the peasant; the newly-baked cakes  were attacked; even the poorest child said, \"It is really delightful  here in winter!\"    Yes, it was delightful; and the little maiden showed the boy everything;  and the Elder Tree still was fragrant, and the red flag, with the white  cross, was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the New  Booths had sailed. And the boy grew up to be a lad, and was to go forth  in the wide world-far, far away to warm lands, where the coffee-tree  grows; but at his departure the little maiden took an Elder-blossom from  her bosom, and gave it him to keep; and it was placed between the leaves  of his Prayer-Book; and when in foreign lands he opened the book, it  was always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay; and the more he  looked at it, the fresher it became; he felt as it were, the fragrance  of the Danish groves; and from among the leaves of the flowers he could  distinctly see the little maiden, peeping forth with her bright blue  eyes--and then she whispered, \"It is delightful here in Spring, Summer,  Autumn, and Winter\"; and a hundred visions glided before his mind.    Thus passed many years, and he was now an old man, and sat with his old  wife under the blooming tree. They held each other by the hand, as the  old grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the New Booths did, and they  talked exactly like them of old times, and of the fiftieth anniversary  of their wedding. The little maiden, with the blue eyes, and with  Elder-blossoms in her hair, sat in the tree, nodded to both of them,  and said, \"To-day is the fiftieth anniversary!\" And then she took two  flowers out of her hair, and kissed them. First, they shone like silver,  then like gold; and when they laid them on the heads of the old people,  each flower became a golden crown. So there they both sat, like a king  and a queen, under the fragrant tree, that looked exactly like an elder:  the old man told his wife the story of \"Old Nanny,\" as it had been told  him when a boy. And it seemed to both of them it contained much that  resembled their own history; and those parts that were like it pleased  them best.    \"Thus it is,\" said the little maiden in the tree, \"some call me 'Old  Nanny,' others a 'Dryad,' but, in reality, my name is 'Remembrance';  'tis I who sit in the tree that grows and grows! I can remember; I can  tell things! Let me see if you have my flower still?\"    And the old man opened his Prayer-Book. There lay the Elder-blossom,  as fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before; and  Remembrance nodded, and the old people, decked with crowns of gold, sat  in the flush of the evening sun. They closed their eyes, and--and--!  Yes, that's the end of the story!    The little boy lay in his bed; he did not know if he had dreamed or  not, or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. The  tea-pot was standing on the table, but no Elder Tree was growing out  of it! And the old man, who had been talking, was just on the point of  going out at the door, and he did go.    \"How splendid that was!\" said the little boy. \"Mother, I have been to  warm countries.\"    \"So I should think,\" said his mother. \"When one has drunk two good  cupfuls of Elder-flower tea, 'tis likely enough one goes into warm  climates\"; and she tucked him up nicely, least he should take cold. \"You  have had a good sleep while I have been sitting here, and arguing with  him whether it was a story or a fairy tale.\"    \"And where is old Nanny?\" asked the little boy.    \"In the tea-pot,\" said his mother; \"and there she may remain.\"          THE BELL    People said \"The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting.\" For a  strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town.  It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a  moment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude  made too great a noise.    Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were  farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see  the evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much  more distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still  forest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most  solemnly.    A long time passed, and people said to each other--\"I wonder if there  is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet;  let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.\" And the rich  people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely  long to them; and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the  skirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long  branches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The  confectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon  after came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as  a sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to  preserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said  it had been very romantic, and that it was quite a different sort of  thing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted  they had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always  heard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if  it had come from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the  bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and  that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the  country was also observant of it, and vowed that he who could discover  whence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of \"Universal  Bell-ringer,\" even if it were not really a bell.    Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place,  but one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far  enough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that  the sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of  learned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But  whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no  one could say with certainty. So now he got the place of \"Universal  Bell-ringer,\" and wrote yearly a short treatise \"On the Owl\"; but  everybody was just as wise as before.    It was the day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly,  the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was  an eventful day for them; from children they become all at once  grown-up-persons; it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all  at once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining  gloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town;  and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell  with wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go  thither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a  ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her  to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would not have come;  the other was a poor boy, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#20)"],[1,"THE TEMPLE    Jesus was brought to Nazareth when he was a little child not more than  three years old; there he grew up as a boy and a young man, and there he  lived until he was thirty years of age. We should like to know many  things about his boyhood, but the Bible tells us very little. As Joseph  was a working man, it is likely that he lived in a house with only one  room, with no floor except the earth, no window except a hole in the  wall, no pictures upon the walls, and neither bedstead, nor chair, nor  looking-glass. They sat upon the floor or upon cushions; they slept upon  rolls of matting, and their meals were taken from a low table not much  larger than a stool.    Jesus may have learned to read at the village school, which was  generally held in the house used for worship, called the \"synagogue.\"  The lessons were from rolls on which were written parts of the Old  Testament; but Jesus never had a Bible of his own. From a child he went  with Joseph to the worship in the synagogue twice every week. There they  sat on the floor and heard the Old Testament read and explained, while  Mary and the younger sisters of Jesus listened from a gallery behind a  lattice-screen. The Jewish boys of that time were taught to know almost  the whole of the Old Testament by heart.    It was the custom of the Jews from all parts of the land to go up to  Jerusalem to worship at least once every year, at the feast of the  Passover, which was held in the spring. Some families also stayed to the  feast of Pentecost, which was fifty days after Passover; and some went  again in the fall to the feast of Tabernacles, when for a week all the  families slept out of doors, under roofs made of green twigs and bushes.    When Jesus was a boy twelve years old, he was taken up to the feast of  the Passover, and there for the first time he saw the holy city  Jerusalem, and the Temple of the Lord on Mount Moriah. Young as he was,  his soul was stirred, as he walked among the courts of the Temple and  saw the altar with its smoking sacrifice, the priests in their white  robes, and the Levites with their silver trumpets. Though a boy, Jesus  began to feel that he was the Son of God, and that this was his Father's  house.    [Illustration: _Sitting in a company of the doctors of the law_]    His heart was so filled with the worship of the Temple, with the words  of the scribes or teachers whom he heard in the courts, and with his own  thoughts, that when it was time to go home to Nazareth, he stayed  behind, held fast by his love for the house of the Lord. The company of  people who were traveling together was large, and at first he was not  missed. But when night came and the boy Jesus could not be found, his  mother was alarmed. The next day Joseph and Mary left their company and  hastened back to Jerusalem. They did not at first think to go to the  Temple. They sought him among their friends and kindred who were living  in the city, but could not find him.    On the third day, they went up to the Temple with heavy hearts, still  looking for their boy. And there they found him sitting in a company of  the doctors of the law, listening to their words and asking them  questions. Everybody who stood near was surprised to find how deep was  the knowledge of this boy in the word of the Lord.    His mother spoke to him a little sharply, for she felt that her son had  not been thoughtful of his duty. She said: \"Child, why have you treated  us in this way? Do you not know that your father and I have been looking  for you with troubled hearts?\"    \"Why did you seek for me,\" said Jesus. \"Did you not know that I must be  in my Father's house?\"    They did not understand these words; but Mary thought often about them  afterward; for she felt her son was no common child, and that his words  had a deep meaning. Though Jesus was wise beyond his years, he obeyed  Joseph and his mother in all things. He went with them to Nazareth, and  lived contented with the plain life of their country home.    As the years went on, Jesus grew from a boy to a young man. He grew,  too, in knowledge, and in wisdom, and in the favor of God. He won the  love of all who knew him, for there was something in his nature that  drew all hearts, both young and old.    Jesus learned the trade of a carpenter with Joseph; and when Joseph  died, while Jesus was still a young man, Jesus worked as a carpenter,  and helped his mother take care of the family. And so in the carpenter  shop, and the quiet life of a country village, and the worship of the  synagogue, the years passed until Jesus was thirty years of age.        THE STORY OF THE WATER THAT WAS TURNED INTO WINE    A few days after Jesus met his followers or disciples at the river  Jordan, he came with these men to a town in Galilee called Cana, to be  present at a wedding. In those lands a feast was always held at a  wedding, and often the friends of those who were married stayed several  days, eating and drinking together.    The mother of Jesus was at this wedding as a friend of the family; for  Nazareth, where she lived, was quite near to Cana. Before the wedding  feast was over, all the wine had been used, and there was no more for  the guests to drink. The mother of Jesus knew that her son had power to  do whatever he chose; and she said to him; \"They have no wine.\"    Jesus said to her: \"O woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not  yet come.\"    But his mother knew that Jesus would in some way help the people in  their need, and she said to the servants who were waiting at the table:    \"Whatever he tells you to do, be sure to do it.\"    In the dining hall were standing six large stone jars, each about as  large as a barrel, holding twenty-five gallons. These jars held water  for washing, as the Jews washed their hands before every meal, and  washed their feet as often as they came from walking in the street,  since they wore no shoes, but only sandals. Jesus said to the servants:    \"Fill the jars with water.\"    [Illustration: _\"Fill the jars with water\"_]    The servants obeyed Jesus, and filled the jars up to the brim. Then  Jesus spoke to them again, and said:    \"Now draw out some of the water, and take it to the ruler of the feast.\"    They drew out water from the jars, and saw that it had been turned into  wine. The ruler did not know from what place the wine had come; but he  said to the young man who had just been married, the bridegroom:    \"At a feast everybody gives his best wine at the beginning, and  afterward, when his guests have drunk freely, he brings on wine that is  not so good; but you have kept the good wine until now.\"    This was the first time that Jesus used the power that God had given  him, to do what no other man could do. Such works as these were called  \"miracles\"; and Jesus did them as signs of his power as the Son of God.  When the disciples saw this miracle, they believed in Jesus more fully  than before.    After this Jesus went with his mother and his younger brothers to a  place called Capernaum, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. But they  stayed there only a few days, for the feast of the Passover was near,  and Jesus went up to Jerusalem to attend it. You remember that the feast  of the Passover was held every year, to keep in mind how God had led the  people of Israel out of Egypt long before.    When Jesus came to Jerusalem, he found in the courts of the Temple men  who were selling oxen and sheep and doves for the sacrifices, and other  men sitting at tables changing the money of Jews who came from other  lands into the money of Judea. All this made the courts around the  Temple seem like a market, and not a place for the worship of God.    [Illustration: _\"Take these things away\"_]    Jesus picked up some cord and made from it a little whip. With it he  began to drive out of the Temple all the buyers and sellers. He was but  one, and they were many; but such power was in his look, that they ran  before him. He drove the men and the sheep and the oxen; he overturned  the tables and threw on the floor the money, and to those who were  selling the doves he said: \"Take these things away; make not my Father's  house a house for selling and buying!\"    The acts of Jesus were not pleasing to the rulers of the Jews, for many  of them were making money by this selling of sacrifices and changing of  money. Some of the rulers came to Jesus and said to him: \"What right  have you to come here and do such things as these? What sign can you  show that God has given to you power to rule in this place?\"    Jesus said to them: \"I will give you a sign. Destroy this house of God,  and in three days I will raise it up.\"    Then said the Jews, \"It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple,  and it is not finished yet. Will you raise it up in three days?\"    But Jesus did not mean that Temple on Mount Moriah. He was speaking of  himself, for in him God was dwelling as in a temple, and he meant that  when they should put him to death, he would rise again in three days.  Afterward, when Jesus had died and risen again, his followers, the  disciples, thought of what he had said, and understood these words.          THE STORY OF THE STRANGER AT THE WELL      While Jesus was teaching in Jerusalem and in the country places near it,  John the Baptist was still preaching and baptizing. But already the  people were leaving John and going to hear Jesus. Some of the followers  of John the Baptist were not pleased as they saw that fewer people came  to their master, and that the crowds were seeking Jesus. But John said  to them: \"I told you that I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before  him. Jesus is the Christ, the king. He must grow greater, while I must  grow less; and I am glad that it is so.\"    Soon after this, Herod Antipas, the king of the province or land of  Galilee, put John in prison. Herod had taken for his wife a woman named  Herodias, who had left her husband to"]]]
