Changing our course to 60 degrees west of north, we traversed a  very extensive tract of clear ground until, after crossing four miles and  a half of it, we reached a bend of the river, and at three P.M. encamped  on an open spot a quarter of a mile from it. At five o'clock the other  cart came up, having been substantially repaired, by taking off the ring,  shortening the felloes, closing them on the spokes, and then replacing  the ring again by drilling two holes through it.    January 11.    Pursuing a westerly course I found the river on my right at five miles.  At a mile further it crossed my intended line of route, and obliged me to  turn south-south-west, in which direction we intercepted the junction of  the dry river, named Kareen, which we crossed on the 8th instant. The bed  above the junction was narrow but deep, and the permanent character of  its banks gave to this channel the appearance of a considerable  tributary, which it probably may be at some seasons, although then dry.  In a section of the bank near the junction, I observed a bed of  calcareous tuff. The passage of this channel was easiest for the carts at  the spot where it joined that of the Gwydir. We travelled, after  crossing, along the north-western skirts of extensive open plains, and  thus reached, at five miles further, another line of trees, enclosing a  chain of ponds, on which we encamped, after a journey of twelve miles.    TORTUOUS COURSE OF THE GWYDIR.    January 12.    I continued the westerly course through woods until at three miles we  fell in with the river, and on turning to the left in order to avoid its  immediate banks, a large lagoon also obstructed our progress. The  tortuous course of the river was such that it was only by pursuing a  direction parallel to the general course we could hope to make sufficient  progress. But in exploring the general course only of rivers the  traveller must still grope his way occasionally; for here, after turning  the lagoon, we again encountered the river taking such a bend southward  that we were compelled to travel towards the east, and even northward of  east, to avoid the furrowed ground on its immediate bank.    LINES OF IRRIGATION ACROSS THE PLAINS.    At length we reached an open tract across which we travelled in a  south-west direction about eight miles, when we arrived at one of those  watercourses or chains of ponds which always have the appearance of being  on the highest parts of the plains. As the general course of this, as far  as it could be seen, was nearly east and west, I thought it might be the  same as the channel which I had named Wheel Ponds on the 7th instant; but  the range of these chains of ponds, not being confined by any hills of  note, I could not be certain as to the identity, or whether such channels  did not separate into different branches on that level country. The ponds  they contained, even during the dry season, and the permanent character  of their banks, each lined with a single row of trees throughout a  meandering course over naked plains, bespoke a providential arrangement  for the support of life in these melancholy wastes, which, indeed,  redeemed them from the character of deserts. We encamped on this chain of  ponds, having first crossed the channel, that we might have no impediment  before us, in the morning; experience having taught us that the cattle  could overcome a difficulty of this kind better when warmed to their work  than at first starting from their feeding-place.    HEAVY RAIN--UNABLE TO PROCEED.    Some very heavy thundershowers fell, but the sky became clear in the  evening so that we ascertained the latitude to be 29 degrees 39 minutes  49 seconds South. We also obtained the bearing of Mount Riddell, and  other points of the Nundewar range, making our latitude 146 degrees 37  minutes 30 seconds East.    CRESTED PIGEON.    On these ponds we first saw the beautiful crested pigeon mentioned by Mr.  Oxley as frequenting the neighbourhood of the marshes of the Macquarie.    THE PARTY IMPEDED BY THE SOFT STATE OF THE SURFACE.    January 13.    We packed up our tents to proceed on our journey as usual, the weather  being beautiful; but after three hours of excessive toil the bullocks had  not advanced two miles, because the stiff clay so clogged the wheels that  it could not be easily removed. Seeing the cattle so distressed I was  compelled to encamp, and await the effect of the sunshine and the breeze  on the clammy surface.    LAGOONS NEAR THE RIVER.    In the meantime I rode northward towards the river accompanied by Mr.  White and, at about a mile from the tents, we found one of the lagoons  which are supplied by its floods. The margin was thickly imprinted with  the marks of small naked feet, in all probability those of the gins and  children whose most constant food, in these parts, appeared to be a  large, freshwater mussel. We next traced the course of the river westward  for about five miles, being guided by the line of river trees. When we  arrived we found within them a still lagoon of deep water, the banks  thereof being steep like a river, and enclosing the water within a very  tortuous canal, or channel, which I had no doubt belonged to the river.  To the southward the whole country was clear of wood, and presented one  general slope towards the line of the river.    From our camp on the plain Mount Riddell bore 123 degrees 30 minutes  East.    THE SURFACE AGAIN HARDENED.    January 14.    After an unusually hot night the morning broke amid thunderclouds which  threatened, by another shower, to destroy our hopes of advancing this day  and the next at least. Nevertheless, we lost no time in yoking the cattle  and proceeding: for the heat and drought of the previous day had already  formed a crust upon which the animals could travel. Meanwhile the thunder  roared, and heavy showers were to be seen falling in two directions. One  rain-cloud in the north-east, whence the wind blew strong, nearly  overtook us; while another in the south-west exhausted itself on the  Nundewar range. But as the wind increased the storm-clouds sank rapidly  towards the part of the horizon whence it came, until the beams of the  ascending sun at length overwhelmed them with a glorious flood of light,  and introduced a day of brilliant sunshine.    EXCURSION NORTHWARD.    We traversed, as rapidly as we could, these precarious plains, keeping  the woods which enveloped the Gwydir on our right: and thus, at the end  of twelve miles, we arrived on the banks of a lagoon, apparently a  continuation of the line of ponds or river, which had proved such a  providential relief to us after our severe suffering from want of water  under Mount Frazer.    REACH A BROAD SHEET OF WATER.    Here however we found a broad and extensive lagoon nearly level with its  banks and covered with ducks. It had the winding character and uniformity  of width of a river, but no current. I thought this reach might also  contain some surplus water of the Namoi, which could not be far distant  for we had now reached those low levels to which we had previously traced  the course of that river. We travelled along the bank of this fine piece  of water for two miles, and found its breadth to be very uniform. An arm  trending northward then lay in our way. The country was full of holes and  deep rents or cracks, but the soil was loose, and bare as a new-ploughed  field. I therefore withdrew the carts to where we first came on the  lagoon; not only for the sake of grass, but that we might continue our  route over the firmer ground which appeared to the eastward.    POSITION OF THE PARTY. THE COMMON COURSE OF THE RIVER AND THE SITUATION  OF THE RANGE CONSIDERED.    I had now on my map the Nundewar range with the courses of the Namoi on  one side, and the Gwydir on the other. I was between these two rivers,  and at no great distance from either; Mount Riddell, the nearest point of  the range, bore 21 1/2 degrees South of East, being distant 42 miles. The  opposite bearing or 20 degrees North of West might therefore be  considered to express the common direction of these waters. In a country  so liable to inundation as the district between these rivers appeared to  be, it was a primary object with us to travel along the highest or driest  part, and we could only look for this advantage in the above direction,  or parallel to and midway between the rivers. We could in this manner  trace out their junction with more certainty, and so terminate thus far  the survey of both by the determination of a point so important in  geography. The soil of these level open tracts consisted of a rich,  dark-coloured clay. The lagoon was marked by a row of stunted trees which  grew along its edge on each side, so that the line could be distinguished  from a great distance eastward, and appeared to be connected with the  ponds of Gorolei.    NONDESCRIPT TREE AND FRUIT.    Among the trees growing along the margin of this lagoon were several  which were new to me; particularly one which bore clusters of a fruit  resembling a small russet apple and about an inch in diameter. The skin  was rough, the pulp of a rich crimson colour not unlike that of the  prickly-pear, and it had an agreeable acid flavour. This pulp covered a  large rough stone containing several seeds, and it was evidently eaten by  the natives as great numbers of the bare stones lay about. The foliage of  the tree very much resembled the white cedar of the colonists, and milk  exuded from the stalk or leaves when broken.    A great variety of ducks and other waterfowl covered this fine piece of  water. We made the latitude of the camp 29 degrees 49 minutes South, the  longitude 149 degrees 28 minutes East.    January 15.    The country to the northward seemed so low and the course of the Gwydir,  amid so many lagoons, so doubtful that I considered it advisable to ride  in that direction before we ventured to advance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#20)"],[1," The coast here lies S. by  E. and N. by W. It is of an even height; and was named ANTONY VAN  DIEMEN's LAND, in honour of the governor-general, \"our master, who sent  us out to make discoveries. The islands round about, as many of them as  were known to us, we called in honour of the Council of India.\"    The ships stood off again for the night, with a light breeze at S. S. E.  On the 26th, the wind was from the eastward, and weather rainy, so that  no land could be seen; but its distance was supposed to be twelve or  thirteen leagues. At noon, the latitude from dead reckoning was 43 deg. 36',  and longitude 163 deg. 2'; the course having been S. S. W. 72 miles.* In the  evening the wind shifted to the north-east, and their course was directed  E. S. E.: the variation was then half a degree west.    [* This and the following courses and distances run from one noon to  another, do not always agree with the latitudes and longitudes; but the  differences are not great: They probably arose from the distances being  marked to the nearest Dutch mile on the log board; whereas the latitude  and longitude are taken to minutes of a degree.]    Nov. 27, the land was again seen. At noon, a course of S. E. by E. 52  miles, gave the latitude by estimation 44 deg. 4' south, and longitude 164 deg.  2' east. The weather was thick and rainy, and the wind still from the  north-eastward; and at the fourth hour of the night, the vessels lay to,  not venturing to run in the dark. In the morning of the 28th, it was  foggy, with rain. They made sail to the east; but on seeing the land from  N. E. to N. N. E., hauled up for it. From what could be perceived of the  coast, it extended S. E. by E. and N. W. by W., and seemed to decrease in  height to the eastward. At noon, the latitude by estimation was 44 deg. 1',  longitude 165 deg. 2'; and the course steered, E. by S. 44 miles. The wind  was then at north-west; and in the evening, they came near three small  islands, one of which was shaped like a lion's head, and lies twelve  miles from the continent (this was the _Mewstone_, of Furneaux). The wind  was from the eastward in the night, and the ships lay to.    Nov. 29, they were still near the cliffy, lion-head-shaped island. The  wind was light and fair, and they steered parallel to the coast, which  lies here east and west. At noon, having made a course of E. N. E. 48  miles, the latitude was judged to be 43 deg. 53', longitude 166 deg. 3'. They  had, a little before, passed two cliffy islets lying to seaward; of which  the westernmost (_Swilly_ of Furneaux) is like _Pedra Blanca_ near the  coast of China: the easternmost (_Eddystone_ of Cook) resembles an  awkward tower, and is about sixteen miles from the main land. Continuing  to coast along the shore, they came, at five in the evening, to a bay,  into which it was resolved in council to enter; but when almost in it, a  high wind rose, and obliged them to shorten sail and stand out to sea. At  daylight of the 30th, they found themselves driven so far off by the  _storm_ (whence the name of STORM BAY, applied in the chart), that the  land was scarcely visible. At noon, the general course had been E. by N.  80 miles; the latitude _was found_ to be 43 deg. 41', and longitude by  estimation (corrected) 168 deg. 3': the needle pointed here, true North. The  land was in sight to the north-west, and the wind strong, but variable,  from the northward. The ships steered westward for a short time; but the  weather being too stormy to admit of approaching the land, they went upon  the other tack; and kept as much to the northward., under easy sail, as  the wind would permit.    Dec. 1, the wind was more moderate; and on its veering to W. S. W., the  ships steered towards the shore. At noon, their course made good was N.  N. W. 39 miles; the latitude was 43 deg. 10' and longitude 167 deg. 55'. It then  fell calm, and a council of officers from the two vessels was called, in  which it was resolved, if wind and weather permitted, \"to get a knowledge  of the land, and some refreshments.\" An eastern breeze sprung up soon  afterward; and they got to anchor, an hour after sunset, \"in a good port,  in 22 fathoms, whitish good-holding sand; wherefore we ought to cc praise  GOD ALMIGHTY.\" This port is called FREDERIK HENDRIK'S BAY, in the chart.    Next morning early, two armed boats were sent to an inlet (the inner  bay), situate four or five miles to the north-westward of the ships, in  order to search for fresh water, wood, and refreshments. They returned in  the afternoon, and the officers gave the following account.    They rowed four or five miles round the point of the inlet, along a high  and level shore. Wild greens were plentiful; some resembled those at the  Cape of Good Hope, \"and may be used in place of wormwood;\" others were  long and saltish, and like sea parsley. They found many dry gullies, and  one watering place in which the water was good, but obtained with  difficulty, and in very small quantities. Some human voices were heard,  and a sound like that of a trumpet, or little _gong_, which was not far  off; but they could see no person. Amongst the trees, two were remarked  whose thickness was two, or two and a half fathoms, and the first  branches from sixty to sixty-five feet above the ground. The bark had  been taken off with a flint stone, and steps were cut, full five feet one  from the other; whence the natives were presumed to be very tall, or able  to get up these trees by some artifice. They supposed the steps to be  made for the purpose of getting at the nests of birds; and that some of  them had not been cut above four days before. They observed traces on the  ground, as if made by the claws of a tiger; and saw the excrements, as  was thought, of quadrupeds. Some well-looking gums, which dropped from  the trees and somewhat resembled _gum-lac_, were brought on board.    Off the east point of the (inner) bay, they found thirteen to fourteen  feet water; and that the tide flowed about three feet. They there saw a  number of men, of wild ducks, and geese; but inland none were seen,  though their noise was heard. Muscles were found sticking to bushes, in  different places. The country was covered with trees; but so thinly  scattered, that one might see every where to a great distance amongst  them, and distinguish men and animals. Several of the trees were \"much  burnt about the foot; and the ground was here and there like little  squares (_vuysterchen_), and become as hard as stone, by fire.\"    A short time before the boats returned, a thick smoke had been observed  upon the continent, to the west of where the ships lay at anchor; and  from the people staying so much longer than they had been ordered, it was  thought to have been made by them, as a signal. But on inquiry, they  answered in the negative; and said that they, also, had seen smoke in  several places; and bushes--(here seems to be a line omitted.) \"So that  without doubt, here must be exceedingly tall people.\"    Dec. 3. A boat was sent to the south-east part of the (outer) bay, and  found fresh water; but it broke through the low shore to the sea, and was  brackish; and the soil was too rocky to dig wells. In the afternoon,  commodore Tasman went, with several officers from both vessels in two  boats, to the south-east extremity of the bay; taking with them the  PRINCE'S flag, and a post upon which was cut a compass, to be erected on  shore. One of the boats was obliged to return, from the bad weather; but  the shallop went to a little cove W. S. W. of the ships. The surf being  there too high to admit of landing, the first carpenter, _Pieter  Jacobsz_, swam on shore with the post and Prince's flag; and set it up  near the last of four remarkable trees, which stood in the form of a  crescent, in the middle of the cove. \"When the first carpenter had done  this, in the sight of me ABEL J. TASMAN, of the master _Gerrit Jansz_,  and under-merchant _Abraham Coomans_, we went with the shallop as near as  possible to the shore, and the said carpenter swam back, through the  surf. We then returned on board; and left this as a memorial to the  posterity of the inhabitants of this country. They did not show  themselves; but we suspected some to be not far from thence, watching  carefully our doings.\"    The wind was from the northward all this day; and at sunset, it blew a  storm. The variation at anchor was observed to be 3 deg. east; the latitude  was 43 deg. south, and longitude 1671/2 deg. east from Teneriffe.    Dec. 4. The wind was more moderate, and came from the westward, off the  land. The anchors were then weighed, but the flukes of one were broken.  On quitting Frederik Hendrik's Bay, the ships steered northward as much  as possible, to look for a watering place. At noon, the course had been  N. E. 32 miles; the latitude was 42 deg. 40', and longitude 168 deg.. In the  evening, they saw a round mountain, about eleven leagues to the N. N. W.;  and during the whole day, several smokes were visible along the coast.  \"Here,\" says Tasman, \"I should give a description of the extent of the  coast, and the islands near it, but I hope to be excused, and refer, for  brevity's sake, to the chart made of it, and herewith joined.\"    The ships kept close to the wind all night, as they did in the morning of  Dec. 5, when it was N. W. by W. The high round mountain was then seen  bearing west, eight leagues, and this was the furthest land visible, nor  did the wind allow them to come in with it again. At noon, the latitude  was judged to be 41 deg. 34', and longitude 169 deg.; the course for the last day  having been N. E. by N. 80 miles. Tasman then steered \"precisely  eastward, to make further discoveries,\" agreeably to a resolution of the  council, taken in the morning.    The copy of Tasman's charts, given in the Atlas, PLATE III. of  D'Entrecasteaux's Voyage, and taken from Valentyn, is conformable to the  manuscript "]]]
