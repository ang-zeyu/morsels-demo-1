It seems not improbable that the rod very early  formed a part of the fisherman's equipment.    [Footnote 1: As to whether \"angling\" necessarily implies a rod as well  as a line and hook, see the discussion in the law case of _Barnard_ v.  _Roberts_ (_Times L.R._, April 13, 1907), when the question arose  as to the use of night-lines being angling; but the decision against  night-lines went on the ground of the absence of the personal element  rather than on the absence of a rod. The various dictionaries  are blind guides on this point, and the authorities cited are  inconclusive; but, broadly speaking, angling now implies three  necessary factors--a personal angler, the sporting element, and the  use of recognized fishing-tackle.]      _Literary History_.--From prehistoric times down to comparatively  late in the days of chronicles, angling appears to have remained a  practice; its development into an art or sport is a modern idea. In  the earliest literature references to angling are not very numerous,  but there are passages in the Old Testament which show that  fish-taking with hook as well as net was one of the common industries  in the East, and that fish, where it was obtainable, formed an  important article of diet. In _Numbers_ (xi. 5) the children of Israel  mourn for the fish which they \"did eat in Egypt freely.\" So much too  is proved by the monuments of Egypt; indeed more, for the figures  found in some of the Egyptian fishing pictures using short rods and  stout lines are sometimes attired after the manner of those who were  great in the land. This indicates that angling had already, in  a highly civilized country, taken its place among the methods  of diversion at the disposal of the wealthy, though from the  uncompromising nature of the tackle depicted and the apparent  simplicity of the fish it would scarcely be safe to assume that in  Egypt angling arrived at the dignity of becoming an \"art.\" In Europe  it took very much longer for the taking of fish to be regarded even as  an amusement, and the earliest references to it in the Greek and Latin  classics are not very satisfying to the sportsman.    [v.02 p.0022]    There is, however, a passage in the _Odyssey_ (xii. 247) which is of  considerable importance, as it shows that fishing with rod and line  was well enough understood in early Greece to be used as a popular  illustration. It occurs in the well-known scene where Scylla seizes  the companions of Odysseus out of the ship and bears them upwards,  just as \"some fisher on a headland with a long rod\" brings small  fishes gasping to the shore. Another important, though comparatively  late, passage in Greek poetry is the twenty-first idyll of Theocritus.  In this the fisherman Asphalion relates how in a dream he hooked  a large golden fish and describes graphically, albeit with some  obscurity of language, how he \"played\" it. Asphalion used a rod and  fished from a rock, much after the manner of the Homeric angler. Among  other Greek writers, Herodotus has a good many references to fish and  fishing; the capture of fish is once or twice mentioned or implied by  Plato, notably in the _Laws_ (vii. 823); Aristotle deals with fishes  in his _Natural History_, and there are one or two fishing passages  in the anthology. But in Greek literature, as a whole the subject of  angling is not at all prominent. In writers of late Greek, however,  there is more material. Plutarch, for instance, gives us the famous  story of the fishing match between Antony and Cleopatra, which has  been utilized by Shakespeare. Moreover, it is in Greek that the first  complete treatise on fishing which has come down to us is written, the  _Halieutica_ of Oppian (c. A.D. 169). It is a hexameter poem in five  books with perhaps more technical than sporting interest, and not so  much even of that as the length of the work would suggest. Still it  contains some information about tackle and methods, and some passages  describing battles with big fish, in the right spirit of enthusiasm.  Also in Greek is what is famous as the first reference in literature  to fly-fishing, in the fifteenth book of Aelian's _Natural History_  (3rd century A.D.). It is there described how the Macedonians captured  a certain spotted fish in the river Astraeus by means of a lure  composed of coloured wool and feathers, which was presumably used in  the manner now known as \"dapping.\" That there were other Greek writers  who dealt with fish and fishing and composed \"halieutics\" we know from  Athenaeus. In the first book of his _Deipnosophistae_ he gives a list  of them. But he compares their work unfavourably with the passage of  Homer already cited, in a way which suggests that their knowledge of  angling was not a great advance upon the knowledge of their remote  literary ancestors. In Latin literature allusions to angling are  rather more numerous than in Greek, but on the whole they are  unimportant. Part of a poem by Ovid, the _Halieuticon_, composed  during the poet's exile at Tomi after A.D. 9, still survives. In  other Roman writers the subject is only treated by way of allusion or  illustration. Martial, however, provides, among other passages, what  may perhaps be entitled to rank as the earliest notice of private  fishery rights--the epigram _Ad Piscatorem_, which warns would-be  poachers from casting a line in the Baian lake. Pliny the elder  devoted the ninth book of his _Natural History_ to fishes and  water-life, and Plautus, Cicero, Catullus, Horace, Juvenal, Pliny  the younger and Suetonius all allude to angling here and there.  Agricultural writers, too, such as Varro and Columella, deal with the  subject of fish ponds and stews rather fully. Later than any of these,  but still just included in Latin literature, we have Ausonius (_c_.  A.D. 320) and his well-known idyll the _Mosella_, which contains a  good deal about the fish of the Moselle and the methods of catching  them. In this poem is to be found the first recognizable description  of members of the salmon family, and, though the manner of their  application is rather doubtful, the names _salmo, salar_ and _fario_  strike a responsive note in the breast of the modern angler.      _Post-classical Literature_.--As to what happened in the world of  angling in the first few centuries of the Christian era we know  little. It may be inferred, however, that both fish and fishermen  occupied a more honourable position in Christendom than they ever did  before. The prominence of fishermen in the gospel narratives would in  itself have been enough to bring this about, but it also happened  that the Greek word for fish, [Greek: ICHTHUS], had an anagrammatic  significance which the devout were not slow to perceive. The initials  of the word resolve into what is practically a confession of faith,  [Greek: Iesous Christos Theou Uios Soter](Jesus Christ, Son of God,  Saviour). It is therefore not surprising that we find the fish very  prominent as a sacred emblem in the painting and sculpture of  the primitive church, or that Clement of Alexandria should have  recommended it, among other things, as a device for signet rings or  seals. The fisherman too is frequently represented in early Christian  art, and it is worthy of remark that he more often uses a line and  hook than a net. The references to fish and fishing scattered about  in the writings of the early fathers for the most part reflect the two  ideas of the sacredness of the fish and divine authorization of the  fisherman; the second idea certainly prevailed until the time of Izaak  Walton, for he uses it to justify his pastime. It is also not unlikely  that the practice of fasting (in many cases fish was allowed when meat  was forbidden) gave the art of catching fish additional importance.  It seems at any rate to have been a consideration of weight when  sites were chosen for monasteries in Europe, and in many cases when  no fish-producing river was at hand the lack was supplied by the  construction of fish-ponds. Despite all this, however, save for an  occasional allusion in the early fathers, there is hardly a connecting  link between the literature of Pagan Rome and the literature that  sprang up on the invention of printing. One volume, the _Geoponica_, a  Greek compilation concerning whose authorship and date there has  been much dispute, is attributed in _Bibliotheca Piscatoria_ to  the beginning of the 10th century. It contains one book on fish,  fish-ponds and fishing, with prescriptions for baits, &c., extracted  for the most part from other writers. But it seems doubtful whether  its date should not be placed very much earlier. Tradition makes it  a Carthaginian treatise translated into Greek. A more satisfactory  fragment of fishing literature is to be found in the Colloquy of  AElfric, written (_ad pucros linguae latinae locutionis exercendos_)  towards the end of the same century. AElfric became archbishop of  Canterbury in A.D. 995, and the passage in the Anglo-Saxon text-book  takes honourable rank as the earliest reference to fishing in English  writings, though it is not of any great length. It is to be noted that  the fisher who takes a share in the colloquy states that he prefers  fishing in the river to fishing in the sea. Ascribed to the 13th or  14th century is a Latin poem _De Vetula_, whose author was apparently  Richard de Fournival. It contains a passage on angling, and was placed  to the credit of Ovid when first printed (c. 1470). A manuscript in  the British museum, _Comptes des pecheries de l'eglise de Troyes_  (A.D. 1349-1413), gives a minute account of the fisheries with the  weights of fish captured and the expenses of working. There is,  however, practically nothing else of importance till we come to  the first printed book on angling (a translation of Oppian, 1478,  excepted), and so to the beginning of the literature proper.

When they had eaten as much as they desired, a search for the corral was  made, but the mules were so well hidden that they were not able to find  them. Della's father's hands were tied behind him and he was then forced  to show them the hiding place. These fine beasts, used for plowing, were  named by the slaves who worked them. Characteristic names were: \"Jule\",  \"Pigeon\", \"Little Deal\", \"Vic\", (the carriage horse), \"Streaked leg,\"  \"Kicking Kid\", \"Sore-back Janie\". Every one was carried off.    This raid took place on Christmas Eve and the slaves were frantic as  they had been told that Yankees were mean people, especially was Sherman  so pictured.    When Sherman had gone, Mr. Ross came from his hiding place in the \"cool  well\" and spoke to his slaves. To the elder ones he said, \"I saw you  give away my meat and mules.\"    \"Master, we were afraid. We didn't want to do it, but we were afraid not  to.\"    \"Yes, I understand that you could not help yourselves.\" He then turned  to the children, saying, \"Bless all of you, but to little Della, I owe  my life. From now on she shall never be whipped, and she shall have a  home of her own for life.\"    She shook with laughter as she said, \"Master thought I screamed to warn  him and I was only frightened.\"    True to his word, after freedom he gave her a three-acre plot of land  upon which he built a house and added a mule, buggy, cow, hogs, etc.  Della lived there until after her marriage, when she had to leave with  her husband. She later lost her home. Having been married twice, she now  bears the name of Briscoe, her last husband's name.    When the family had again settled down to the ordinary routine, a new  plague, body lice, said to have been left by the invaders, made life  almost unbearable for both races.    Della now lives with her granddaughter, for she has been unable to work  for twenty-eight years. Macon's Department of Public Welfare assists in  contributing to her livelihood, as the granddaughter can only pay the  room rent.    She does not know her age but believes that she is above ninety. Her  keen old eyes seemed to look back into those bygone days as she said, \"I  got along better den dan I eber hab since. We didn't know nuthin 'bout  jail houses, paying for our burial grounds, and de rent. We had plenty  o' food.\"          [HW: Dist. 6  Ex. Slv. #11]    GEORGE BROOKS, EX-SLAVE  Date of birth: Year unknown (See below)  Place of birth: In Muscogee County, near Columbus, Georgia  Present Residence: 502 East 8th Street, Columbus, Georgia  Interviewed: August 4, 1936  [MAY 8 1937]      This old darky, probably the oldest ex-slave in West Georgia, claims to  be 112 years of age. His colored friends are also of the opinion that he  is fully that old or older--but, since none of his former (two) owners'  people can be located, and no records concerning his birth can be found,  his definite age cannot be positively established.    \"Uncle\" George claims to have worked in the fields, \"some\", the year the  \"stars fell\"--1833.    His original owner was Mr. Henry Williams--to whom he was greatly  attached. As a young man, he was--for a number of years--Mr. Williams'  personal body-servant. After Mr. Williams' death--during the 1850's,  \"Uncle\" George was sold to a white man--whose name he doesn't  remember--of Dadeville, Alabama, with whom he subsequently spent five  months in the Confederate service.    One of \"Uncle\" George's stories is to the effect that he once left a  chore he was doing for his second \"Marster's\" wife, \"stepped\" to a  nearby well to get a drink of water and, impelled by some strange,  irresistible \"power\", \"jes kep on walkin 'til he run slap-dab inter de  Yankees\", who corraled him and kept him for three months.    Still another story he tells is that of his being sold after freedom!  According to his version of this incident, he was sold along with two  bales of cotton in the fall of 1865--either the cotton being sold and he  \"thrown in\" with it, or vice versa--he doesn't know which, but he _does  know_ that he and the cotton were \"sold\" together! And very soon after  this transaction occurred, the seller was clapped in jail! Then,  \"somebody\" (he doesn't remember who) gave him some money, put him on a  stage-coach at night and \"shipped\" him to Columbus, where he learned  that he was a free man and has since remained.    \"Uncle\" George has been married once and is the father of several  children. His wife, however, died fifty-odd years ago and he knows  nothing of the whereabouts of his children--doesn't even know whether or  not any of them are living, having lost \"all track o'all kin fokes too  long ago to tawk about.\"    Unfortunately, \"Uncle\" George's mind is clouded and his memory badly  impaired, otherwise his life story would perhaps be quite interesting.  For more than twenty years, he has been supported and cared for by kind  hearted members of his race, who say that they intend to continue \"to  look after the old man 'til he passes on.\"          EX-SLAVE INTERVIEW    EASTER BROWN  1020 S.
