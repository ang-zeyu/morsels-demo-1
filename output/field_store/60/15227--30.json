I give a summary, for the  benefit of those who have had the honour of kissing his majesty's hand.  It is not those who kiss the royal hand who could write best on the  custom.    This custom is not only very ancient, and nearly universal, but has been  alike participated by religion and society.    To begin with religion. From the remotest times men saluted the sun,  moon, and stars, by kissing the hand. Job assures us that he was never  given to this superstition, xxxi. 26. The same honour was rendered to  Baal, 1 Kings xix. 18. Other instances might be adduced.    We now pass to Greece. There all foreign superstitions were received.  Lucian, after having mentioned various sorts of sacrifices which the  rich offered the gods, adds, that the poor adored them by the simpler  compliment of kissing their hands. That author gives an anecdote of  Demosthenes, which shows this custom. When a prisoner to the soldiers of  Antipater, he asked to enter a temple.--When he entered, he touched his  mouth with his hands, which the guards took for an act of religion. He  did it, however, more securely to swallow the poison he had prepared for  such an occasion. He mentions other instances.    From the Greeks it passed to the Romans. Pliny places it among those  ancient customs of which they were ignorant of the origin or the reason.  Persons were treated as atheists, who would not kiss their hands when  they entered a temple. When Apuleius mentions Psyche, he says, she was  so beautiful that they adored her as Venus, in kissing the right hand.    The ceremonial action rendered respectable the earliest institutions of  Christianity. It was a custom with the primaeval bishops to give their  hands to be kissed by the ministers who served at the altar.    This custom, however, as a religious rite, declined with Paganism.    In society our ingenious academician considers the custom of kissing  hands as essential to its welfare. It is a mute form, which expresses  reconciliation, which entreats favours, or which thanks for those  received. It is an universal language, intelligible without an  interpreter; which doubtless preceded writing, and perhaps speech  itself.    Solomon says of the flatterers and suppliants of his time, that they  ceased not to kiss the hands of their patrons, till they had obtained  the favours which they solicited. In Homer we see Priam kissing the  hands and embracing the knees of Achilles, while he supplicates for the  body of Hector.    This custom prevailed in ancient Rome, but it varied. In the first ages  of the republic, it seems to have been only practised by inferiors to  their superiors:--equals gave their hands and embraced. In the progress  of time even the soldiers refused to show this mark of respect to their  generals; and their kissing the hand of Cato when he was obliged to quit  them was regarded as an extraordinary circumstance, at a period of such  refinement. The great respect paid to the tribunes, consuls, and  dictators, obliged individuals to live with them in a more distant and  respectful manner; and instead of embracing them as they did formerly,  they considered themselves as fortunate if allowed to kiss their hands.  Under the emperors, kissing hands became an essential duty, even for the  great themselves; inferior courtiers were obliged to be content to adore  the purple, by kneeling, touching the robe of the emperor by the right  hand, and carrying it to the mouth. Even this was thought too free; and  at length they saluted the emperor at a distance, by kissing their  hands, in the same manner as when they adored their gods.    It is superfluous to trace this custom in every country where it exists.  It is practised in every known country, in respect to sovereigns and  superiors, even amongst the negroes, and the inhabitants of the New  World. Cortez found it established at Mexico, where more than a thousand  lords saluted him, in touching the earth with their hands, which they  afterwards carried to their mouths.    Thus, whether the custom of salutation is practised by kissing the hands  of others from respect, or in bringing one's own to the mouth, it is of  all other customs the most universal. This practice is now become too  gross a familiarity, and it is considered as a meanness to kiss the hand  of those with whom we are in habits of intercourse; and this custom  would be entirely lost, if _lovers_ were not solicitous to preserve it  in all its full power.          POPES.      Valois observes that the Popes scrupulously followed, in the early ages  of the church, the custom of placing their names after that of the  person whom they addressed in their letters. This mark of their humility  he proves by letters written by various Popes. Thus, when the great  projects of politics were yet unknown to them, did they adhere to  Christian meekness. At length the day arrived when one of the Popes,  whose name does not occur to me, said that \"it was safer to quarrel with  a prince than with a friar.\" Henry VI. being at the feet of Pope  Celestine, his holiness thought proper to kick the crown off his head;  which ludicrous and disgraceful action Baronius has highly praised.  Jortin observes on this great cardinal, and advocate of the Roman see,  that he breathes nothing but fire and brimstone; and accounts kings and  emperors to be mere catchpolls and constables, bound to execute with  implicit faith all the commands of insolent ecclesiastics. Bellarmin was  made a cardinal for his efforts and devotion to the papal cause, and  maintaining this monstrous paradox,--that if the pope forbid the  exercise of virtue, and command that of vice, the Roman church, under  pain of a sin, was obliged to abandon virtue for vice, if it would not  sin against _conscience_!    It was Nicholas I., a bold and enterprising Pope, who, in 858,  forgetting the pious modesty of his predecessors, took advantage of the  divisions in the royal families of France, and did not hesitate to place  his name before that of the kings and emperors of the house of France,  to whom he wrote. Since that time he has been imitated by all his  successors, and this encroachment on the honours of monarchy has passed  into a custom from having been tolerated in its commencement.    Concerning the acknowledged _infallibility of the Popes_, it appears  that Gregory VII., in council, decreed that the church of Rome neither  _had erred_, and _never should err_. It was thus this prerogative of his  holiness became received, till 1313, when John XXII. abrogated decrees  made by three popes his predecessors, and declared that what was done  _amiss_ by one pope or council might be _corrected_ by another; and  Gregory XI., 1370, in his will deprecates, _si quid in catholica fide  erasset_. The university of Vienna protested against it, calling it a  contempt of God, and an idolatry, if any one in matters of faith should  appeal from a _council_ to the _Pope_; that is, from _God_ who presides  in _councils_, to _man_. But the _infallibility_ was at length  established by Leo X., especially after Luther's opposition, because  they despaired of defending their indulgences, bulls, &c., by any other  method.    Imagination cannot form a scene more terrific than when these men were  in the height of power, and to serve their political purposes hurled the  thunders of their _excommunications_ over a kingdom. It was a national  distress not inferior to a plague or famine.    Philip Augustus, desirous of divorcing Ingelburg, to unite himself to  Agnes de Meranie, the Pope put his kingdom under an interdict. The  churches were shut during the space of eight months; they said neither  mass nor vespers; they did not marry; and even the offspring of the  married, born at this unhappy period, _were considered as illicit_: and  because the king would not sleep with his wife, it was not permitted to  any of his subjects to sleep with theirs! In that year France was  threatened with an extinction of the ordinary generation. A man under  this curse of public penance was divested of all his functions, civil,  military, and matrimonial; he was not allowed to dress his hair, to  shave, to bathe, nor even change his linen; so that upon the whole this  made a filthy penitent. The good king Robert incurred the censures of  the church for having married his cousin. He was immediately abandoned.  Two faithful domestics alone remained with him, and these always passed  through the fire whatever he touched. In a word, the horror which an  excommunication occasioned was such, that a courtesan, with whom one  Peletier had passed some moments, having learnt soon afterwards that he  had been about six months an excommunicated person, fell into a panic,  and with great difficulty recovered from her convulsions.          LITERARY COMPOSITION.      To literary composition we may apply the saying of an ancient  philosopher:--\"A little thing gives perfection, although perfection is  not a little thing.\"    The great legislator of the Hebrews orders us to pull off the fruit for  the first three years, and not to taste them. He was not ignorant how it  weakens a young tree to bring to maturity its first fruits. Thus, on  literary compositions, our green essays ought to be picked away. The  word _Zamar_, by a beautiful metaphor from _pruning trees_, means in  Hebrew to _compose verses_. Blotting and correcting was so much  Churchill's abhorrence, that I have heard from his publisher he once  energetically expressed himself, that _it was like cutting away one's  own flesh_. This strong figure sufficiently shows his repugnance to an  author's duty. Churchill now lies neglected, for posterity will only  respect those who        ----File off the mortal part      Of glowing thought with Attic art.                                     YOUNG.

Thus in  [O.] (_tempus perfectum_, _prolatio major_) or [9/8], the  _brevis_ was reckoned worth three _semibrevi_ [B = S S S]  ([1. = 4. 4. 4.]); the _semibrevis_ three _minimi_ [S = M M M]  ([4. = 8 8 8]). In [O] or [3/4] time [B = S S S] ([2. = 4 4 4]);  but the _semibrevis_ was only as long as two _minimi_ [S = M M]  ([4 = 8 8]). In [C.] or [6/8] time [B = S S] ([2. = 4. 4.]),  but [S = M M M] ([4. = 8 8 8]). In [C] or [2/2] time [B = S S]  ([1 = 2 2]), and [S = M M] ([2 = 4 4]).    In the beginning of the fifteenth century the notes began to  be written in an open form        [Illustration] _Maxima_.      [Illustration] _Longa_.      [Illustration] _Brevis_.      [Illustration] _Semibrevis_.      [Illustration] _Minima_.      [Illustration] _Semiminima_, which was added later.    As still smaller units of value were added, the _semiminima_  was replaced by [filled minima], and the half _semiminima_  thus became [minima with tail], and the next smaller values,  [two tails] and [three tails]. The rest to correspond to  the _semiminima_ was [illustration]; for the _semibrevis_  [illustration], and _minima_ [illustration].    Thus we have the following values and their corresponding rests:        _Maxima_                   [Illustration]      _Longa_                    [Illustration]      _Brevis_                   [Illustration]      _Semibrevis_               [Illustration]      _Minima_                   [Illustration]      _Semiminima_ or _crocheta_ [Illustration]      _Fusa_ or _crocheta_       [Illustration]      _Semifusa_                 [Illustration]    The rests for the _fusa_ and _semifusa_ were turned to the left  in order to avoid the confusion that would ensue if the rest  [illustration] stood for [fusa]. Besides, the sign would have  easily become confused with the C clef [illustration].    Signs for the changes of _tempo_, that is to say changes  from quick to slow, etc., were introduced in the fifteenth  century. The oldest of them consists of drawing a line through  the _tempus_ sign [O|]. This meant that the notes were to be  played or sung twice as rapidly as would usually be the case,  without, however, affecting the relative value of the notes  to one another. Now we remember that the sign [C] stood for  our modern [4/4] time; when a line was drawn through it,  [C|] it indicated that two _brevi_ were counted as one, and  the movement was said to be _alla breve_. This is the one  instance of time signatures that has come down to us unaltered.          IX    THE SYSTEMS OF HUCBALD AND GUIDO D'AREZZO--THE BEGINNING  OF COUNTERPOINT      We have seen that by order of Charlemagne, Ambrosian chant was  superseded by that of Gregory, and from any history of music  we may learn how he caused the Gregorian chant to be taught  to the exclusion of all other music. Although Notker, in the  monastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, and others developed the  Gregorian chant, until the time of Hucbald this music remained  mere wandering melody, without harmonic support of any kind.    Hucbald (840-930) was a monk of the monastery of St. Armand in  Flanders. As we know from our studies in notation, he was the  first to improve the notation by introducing a system of lines  and spaces, of which, however, the spaces only were utilized  for indicating the notes, viz.:        [Illustration]    His attempt to reconstruct the musical scale was afterwards  overshadowed by the system invented by Guido d'Arezzo, and it  is therefore unnecessary to describe it in detail. His great  contribution to progress was the discovery that more than one  sound could be played or sung simultaneously, thus creating a  composite sound, the effect which we call a chord. However,  in deciding which sounds should be allowed to be played or  sung together, he was influenced partly by the mysticism of  his age, and partly by a blind adherence to the remnants of  musical theory which had been handed down from the Greeks. As  Franco of Cologne, later (1200), in systematizing rhythm into  measure, was influenced by the idea of the Trinity in making  his [3/8] or [9/8] time _tempus perfectum_, and adopting for  its symbol the Pythagorean circle [O.] or [O], so Hucbald,  in choosing his series of concords or sounds that harmonize  well together, took the first three notes of the overtones of  every sonorous fundamental, or, to express it differently, of  the series of natural harmonics, that is to say, he admitted  the octave and fifth: [F: g, d g]. But from the fifth to the  octave gives the interval of the fourth, therefore he permitted  this combination also.    From the works of Boethius (_circa_ 400) and others, he had  derived and accepted the Pythagorean division of the scale,  making thirds and sixths dissonant intervals; and so his perfect  chord (from which our later triad gets its name of _perfect_)  was composed of a root, fifth or fourth, and octave.    Hucbald, as I have already explained, changed the Greek tone  system somewhat by arranging it in four regular disjunct  tetrachords, namely:        [F: (g, a, b-, c) (d e f g) G: (a b c' d') (e' f+' g' a')]    This system permitted the addition of a fifth to each note  indiscriminately, and the fifths would always be _perfect_; but  in regard to the octaves it was faulty, for obvious reasons. As  his system of notation consisted of merely writing T for tone  and S for semitone between the lines of his staff, it was only  necessary to change the order of these letters for the octave  at the beginning of each line. With the fourth, however,  this device was impossible, and therefore he laid down the  rule that when the voices proceeded in fourths, and a discord  (or augmented fourth) was unavoidable, the lower voice was to  remain on the same note until it could jump to another fourth  forming a perfect interval:      [F: {g b} {g b} {g a} {g b} {d a} {d g} {c f} {c e} {a, d} {g, c}]    This at least brought into the harmony an occasional third,  which gradually became a recognized factor in music.    We probably know that the year 1000 was generally accepted  as the time when the world was to come to an end. In the  _Bibliotheque Nationale_ in Paris there is a manuscript  containing the prophecy which had been handed down for many  centuries; also the signs for the notes to which it was to be  sung, viz.:        [Figure 07]    The text is:        The Judge will speak and the earth shall tremble      with awe. The stars shall be destroyed and the glory      of the moon shall die, the mountains shall be crushed      and the world with all in it shall utterly perish.    With the opening of the eleventh century, such was the relief  from this fear which had been oppressing Christendom, that even  the church reflected it in such strange rites as the _Feast  of Asses_ (January 14th), which was a burlesque of the Mass.    In this travesty of the Mass a young girl, dressed to  represent the Virgin, riding on an ass and carrying a child  in her arms, was conducted to the church door. Upon being  admitted and riding up the aisle to the altar, the girl  tethered the ass to the railing and sat on the steps until  the service was finished. The _Credo_, _Gloria_, etc., all  ended with a \"hee-haw,\" and at the conclusion of the service  the officiating priest brayed three times, and was answered by  the congregation. The mixing of the vernacular with Latin in  this service is the first instance of the use of any language  but Latin in church music.    This quasi-symbolical pantomime gave rise in time to the  mediaeval Passion Plays, or Mysteries, as they were called. That  these travesties of the Mass took different forms in various  countries is very evident when we remember the description  of the \"Abbot of Unreason,\" in Scott's \"Abbot.\" In England,  among other absurdities such as the \"Pope of Fools,\" the \"Ball  Dance,\" etc., they also had the festival of the \"Boy Bishop,\"  in which, between the sixth and twenty-eighth of December,  a boy was made to perform all the functions of a bishop.    It would seem that all this has but little bearing upon  the development of music. As a matter of fact it was a most  potent factor in it, for music was essentially and exclusively  a church property. By permitting the people to secularize  the church rites at certain seasons, it was inevitable that  church music would also become common property for a time,  with this difference, however, that the common people could  carry the tunes away with them, and the music would be the only  thing remaining as a recollection of the carnival. Indeed, the  prevalence of popular songs soon became such that writers of  church music began to use them instead of their being derived  from church music, as was originally the case. This continued to  such an extent that almost up to 1550 a mass was known by the  name of the popular song it was based upon, as, for instance,  the mass of the \"Man in Armour,\" by Josquin des Pres, and those  entitled \"_Je prends conge_\" and \"_Je veult cent mille ecus_.\"    Now we know that the _tempus perfectum_ was _par excellence_  [9/8] and [3/4] time. It was natural therefore that these first  church tunes should have been changed to dances in the hands  of the common people. Even in these dances it is interesting to  note that the same symbolic significance appears to be present,  for the earliest form of these dances was the \"round song,\"  or roundelay, and it was danced in a circle.    Duple time did not come into general use until the beginning of  the fourteenth century. About the same time, the organum (as it  was called) or system of harmonization of Hucbald was discarded,  and Johannes de Muris and Philippe de Vitry championed the  consonant quality of the third and sixth, both major and minor.  The fifth was retained as a consonant, but the fourth was  passed over in silence by "]]]
