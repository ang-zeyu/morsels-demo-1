[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#20)"],[1," the great anti-slavery debate, which broke  out in the Virginia Legislature, during the winter afterward. One of the  legislators, joined to his idol, and who now, that the peril had passed,  laughed at the uprising as a \"petty affair.\" McDowell retorted--\"Was  that a 'petty affair,' which erected a peaceful and confiding portion of  the State into a military camp, which outlawed from pity the unfortunate  beings whose brothers had offended; which barred every door, penetrated  every bosom with fear or suspicion, which so banished every sense of  security from every man's dwelling, that let but a hoof or horn break  upon the silence of the night, and an aching throb would be driven to  the heart? The husband would look to his weapon, and the mother would  shudder and weep upon her cradle. Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his  deluded, drunken handful of followers which produced such effects? Was  it this that induced distant counties, where the very name of  Southampton was strange, to arm and equip for a struggle? No, sir, it  was the _suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself,_--a  suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family, that the same  bloody deed might be acted over at any time and in any place, that the  materials for it were spread through the land, and were always ready for  a like explosion.\"    Sixty one whites and more than a hundred blacks perished in this  catastrophe. The news produced a profound sensation in the Union.  Garrison himself, as he records, was horror-struck at the tidings. Eight  months before he had in a strain of prophecy penetrated the future and  caught a glimpse of just such an appalling tragedy:      \"Wo, if it come with storm, and blood, and fire,    When midnight darkness veils the earth and sky!    Wo to the innocent babe--the guilty sire--    Mother and daughter--friends of kindred tie!    _Stranger and citizen alike shall die!_    Red-handed slaughter his revenge shall feed,    And havoc yell his ominous death-cry,    And wild despair in vain for mercy plead--    While hell itself shall shrink and sicken at the deed!\"      After the Southampton insurrection the slavery agitation increased  apace, and the _Liberator_ and its editor became instantly objects of  dangerous notoriety in it. The eyes of the country were irresistibly  drawn to them. They were at the bottom of the uprising, they were  instigating the slaves to similar outbreaks. The savage growlings of a  storm came thrilling on every breeze from the South, and wrathful  mutterings against the agitator and his paper grew thenceforth more  distinct and threatening throughout the free States. October 15, 1831,  Garrison records in the _Liberator_ that he \"is constantly receiving  from the slave States letters filled with the most diabolical threats  and indecent language.\" In the same month Georgetown, S.C., in a panic  made it unlawful for a free colored person to take the _Liberator_ from  the post-office. In the same month the Charleston _Mercury_ announced  that \"gentlemen of the first respectability\" at Columbia had offered a  reward of fifteen hundred dollars for the arrest and conviction of any  white person circulating the _Liberator_, Walker's pamphlet, \"or any  other publication of seditious tendency.\" In Georgia the same symptoms  of fright were exhibited. In the same month the grand jury at Raleigh,  N.C., indicted William Lloyd Garrison and Isaac Knapp for circulating  the _Liberator_ in that county. It was even confidently expected that a  requisition would be made by the Executive of the State upon the  Governor of Massachusetts for their arrest, when they would be tried  under a law, which made their action felony. \"Whipping and imprisonment  for the first offence, and death, without benefit of clergy, for the  second.\" Governor Floyd said in his message to the Virginia Legislature  in December that there was good cause to suspect that the plans of the  Southampton massacre were \"designed and matured by unrestrained fanatics  in some of the neighboring States.\" Governor Hamilton sent to the South  Carolina Legislature in the same month an excited message on the  situation. He was in entire accord with the Virginia Executive as to the  primary and potent agencies which led to the slave uprising in Virginia.  They were \"incendiary newspapers and other publications put forth in the  non-slave-holding States, and freely circulated within the limits of  Virginia.\" As specimens of \"incendiary newspapers and other  publications, put forth in the non-slave-holding States,\" the South  Carolina official sent along with his message, copies of the _Liberator_  and of Mr. Garrison's address to the \"Free People of Color,\" for the  enlightenment of the members of the Legislature. But it remained for  Georgia to cap the climax of madness when her Legislature resolved:          \"That the sum of five thousand dollars be, and the same is      hereby appropriated, to be paid to any person or persons who      shall arrest, bring to trial and prosecute to conviction, under      the laws of this State, the editor or publisher of a certain      paper called the _Liberator_, published in the town of Boston      and State of Massachusetts; or who shall arrest and bring to      trial and prosecute to conviction, under the laws of this State,      any other person or persons who shall utter, publish, or      circulate within the limits of this State said paper called the      _Liberator_, or any other paper, circular, pamphlet, letter, or      address of a seditious character.\"      This extraordinary resolve was signed Dec. 26, 1831, by \"Wilson Lumpkin,  Governor.\" The whole South was in a state of terror. In its insane  fright it would have made short shrift of the editor of the _Liberator,_  had he by accident, force, or fraud have fallen into the clutches of its  laws. The Georgia reward of five thousand dollars was as Mr. Garrison  put it, \"a bribe to kidnappers.\" The Southern method of dealing with the  agitation within the slave States was violent and effective. There could  be no agitation after the agitators were abolished. And the Southern  method was to abolish the agitators.    The suppression of Abolitionism within the slave States was no difficult  matter, but its suppression at the North was a problem of a wholly  different nature, as the South was not long in finding out. It would not  understand why its violent treatment of the disease within its  jurisdiction could not be prescribed as a remedy by the  non-slave-holding half of the Union within its borders. And so the South  began to call loudly and fiercely for the suppression of a movement  calculated to incite the slaves to insubordination and rebellion. This  demand of the South had its influence at the North. Such newspapers as  the _National Intelligencer,_ and the Boston _Courier_ suggested  amendments to the laws whereby the publication of incendiary writings in  the free States might be prohibited. The latter journal allowed that  under the criminal code of Massachusetts \"every man has a right to  advocate Abolition, or conspiracy, or murder; for he may do all these  without breaking our laws, although in any Southern State public justice  and public safety would require his punishment.\" \"But,\" the editor goes  on to remark, \"if we have no laws upon the subject, it is because the  exigency was not anticipated.... Penal statutes against treasonable and  seditious publications are necessary in all communities. We have them  for our own protection; if they should include provisions for the  protection of our neighbors it would be no additional encroachment upon  the liberty of the press.\" The Governors of Virginia and Georgia  remonstrated with Harrison Gray Otis, who was Mayor of Boston in the  memorable year of 1831, \"against an incendiary newspaper published in  Boston, and, as they alleged, thrown broadcast among their plantations,  inciting to insurrection and its horrid results.\" As a lawyer Mayor  Otis, however, \"perceived the intrinsic, if not insuperable obstacles to  legislative enactments made to prevent crimes from being consummated  beyond the local jurisdiction.\" But the South was not seeking a legal  opinion as to what it could or could not do. It demanded, legal or  illegal, that Garrison and the _Liberator_ be suppressed. To the Boston  mayor the excitement over the editor and his paper seemed like much ado  about nothing. The cause appeared to his supercilious mind altogether  inadequate to the effect. And so he set to work to reduce the panic by  exposing the vulgarity and insignificance of the object, which produced  it. That he might give the Southern bugaboo its _quietus_, he directed  one of his deputies to inquire into a publication, of which \"no member  of the city government, nor any person,\" of his honor's acquaintance,  \"had ever heard.\" The result of this inquiry Mayor Otis reported to the  Southern functionaries.    \"Some time afterward,\" he wrote, \"it was reported to me by the city  officers that they had ferreted out the paper and its editor; that his  office was an obscure hole, his only visible auxiliary a negro boy, and  his supporters a very few insignificant persons of all colors.\"    With this bare bodkin Harrison Gray Otis thought to puncture the  Southern panic. But the slaveholders had correcter notions of the nature  and tendency of the Abolition enterprise than had the Boston mayor. They  had a strange, an obstinate presentiment of disaster from the first  instant that the _Liberator_ loomed upon their horizon. It was a battery  whose guns, unless silenced, would play havoc with Southern interests  and the slave system; _ergo_, the paper must be suppressed; _ergo_, its  editor must be silenced or destroyed. And so when Otis, from his serene  height, assured them of his \"belief that the new fanaticism had not  made, nor was likely to make, proselytes among the respectable classes  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#20)"],[1,"varied leaves are required, it is found that a number of  plants vary sufficiently in this direction also, and we have zonal  geraniums, variegated ivies, gold and silver marked hollies, and many  others.      _Variations of Domestic Animals._    Coming now to our domesticated animals, we find still more extraordinary  cases; and it appears as if any special quality or modification in an  animal can be obtained if we only breed it in sufficient quantity, watch  carefully for the required variations, and carry on selection with  patience and skill for a sufficiently long period. Thus, in sheep we  have enormously increased the wool, and have obtained the power of  rapidly forming flesh and fat; in cows we have increased the production  of milk; in horses we have obtained strength, endurance, or speed, and  have greatly modified size, form, and colour; in poultry we have secured  various colours of plumage, increase of size, and almost perpetual  egg-laying. But it is in dogs and pigeons that the most marvellous  changes have been effected, and these require our special attention.    Our various domestic dogs are believed to have originated from several  distinct wild species, because in every part of the world the native  dogs resemble some wild dogs or wolves of the same country. Thus perhaps  several species of wolves and jackals were domesticated in very early  times, and from breeds derived from these, crossed and improved by  selection, our existing dogs have descended. But this intermixture of  distinct species will go a very little way in accounting for the  peculiarities of the different breeds of dogs, many of which are totally  unlike any wild animal. Such is the case with greyhounds, bloodhounds,  bulldogs, Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, turnspits, pointers, and  many others; and these differ so greatly in size, shape, colour, and  habits, as well as in the form and proportions of all the different  parts of the body, that it seems impossible that they could have  descended from any of the known wild dogs, wolves, or allied animals,  none of which differ nearly so much in size, form, and proportions. We  have here a remarkable proof that variation is not confined to  superficial characters--to the colour, hair, or external appendages,  when we see how the entire skeletons of such forms as the greyhound and  the bulldog have been gradually changed in opposite directions till they  are both completely unlike that of any known wild animal, recent or  extinct. These changes have been the result of some thousands of years  of domestication and selection, different breeds being used and  preserved for different purposes; but some of the best breeds are known  to have been improved and perfected in modern times. About the middle of  the last century a new and improved kind of foxhound was produced; the  greyhound was also greatly improved at the end of the last century,  while the true bulldog was brought to perfection about the same period.  The Newfoundland dog has been so much changed since it was first  imported that it is now quite unlike any existing native dog in that  island.[33]      _Domestic Pigeons._    The most remarkable and instructive example of variation produced by  human selection is afforded by the various races and breeds of domestic  pigeons, not only because the variations produced are often most  extraordinary in amount and diverse in character, but because in this  case there is no doubt whatever that all have been derived from one wild  species, the common rock-pigeon (Columba livia). As this is a very  important point it is well to state the evidence on which the belief is  founded. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue colour, the tail has a  dark band across the end, the wings have two black bands, and the outer  tail-feathers are edged with white at the base. No other wild pigeon in  the world has this combination of characters. Now in every one of the  domestic varieties, even the most extreme, all the above marks, even to  the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, are sometimes found  perfectly developed. When birds belonging to two distinct breeds are  crossed one or more times, neither of the parents being blue, or having  any of the above-named marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt to  acquire some of these characters. Mr. Darwin gives instances which he  observed himself. He crossed some white fantails with some black barbs,  and the mongrels were black, brown, or mottled. He also crossed a barb  with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the  forehead, and the mongrel offspring were dusky and mottled. On now  crossing these two sets of mongrels with each other, he obtained a bird  of a beautiful blue colour, with the barred and white edged tail, and  double-banded wings, so as almost exactly to resemble a wild  rock-pigeon. This bird was descended in the second generation from a  pure white and pure black bird, both of which when unmixed breed their  kind remarkably true. These facts, well known to experienced  pigeon-fanciers, together with the habits of the birds, which all like  to nest in holes, or dovecots, not in trees like the great majority of  wild pigeons, have led to the general belief in the single origin of all  the different kinds.    In order to afford some idea of the great differences which exist among  domesticated pigeons, it will be well to give a brief abstract of Mr.  Darwin's account of them. He divides them into eleven distinct races,  most of which have several sub-races.    RACE I. _Pouters_.--These are especially distinguished by the enormously  enlarged crop, which can be so inflated in some birds as almost to  conceal the beak. They are very long in the body and legs and stand  almost upright, so as to present a very distinct appearance. Their  skeleton has become modified, the ribs being broader and the vertebrae  more numerous than in other pigeons.    RACE II. _Carriers_.--These are large, long-necked birds, with a long  pointed beak, and the eyes surrounded with a naked carunculated skin or  wattle, which is also largely developed at the base of the beak. The  opening of the mouth is unusually wide. There are several sub-races, one  being called Dragons.    RACE III. _Runts_.--These are very large-bodied, long-beaked pigeons,  with naked skin round the eyes. The wings are usually very long, the  legs long, and the feet large, and the skin of the neck is often red.  There are several sub-races, and these differ very much, forming a  series of links between the wild rock-pigeon and the carrier.    RACE IV. _Barbs_.--These are remarkable for their very short and thick  beak, so unlike that of most pigeons that fanciers compare it with that  of a bullfinch. They have also a naked carunculated skin round the eyes,  and the skin over the nostrils swollen.    RACE V. _Fantails_.--Short-bodied and rather small-beaked pigeons, with  an enormously developed tail, consisting usually of from fourteen to  forty feathers instead of twelve, the regular number in all other  pigeons, wild and tame. The tail spreads out like a fan and is usually  carried erect, and the bird bends back its slender neck, so that in  highly-bred varieties the head touches the tail. The feet are small, and  they walk stiffly.    RACE VI. _Turbits and Owls_.--These are characterised by the feathers of  the middle of neck and breast in front spreading out irregularly so as  to form a frill. The Turbits also have a crest on the head, and both  have the beak exceedingly short.    RACE VII. _Tumblers_.--- These have a small body and short beak, but  they are specially distinguished by the singular habit of tumbling over  backwards during flight. One of the sub-races, the Indian Lotan or  Ground tumbler, if slightly shaken and placed on the ground, will  immediately begin tumbling head over heels until taken up and soothed.  If not taken up, some of them will go on tumbling till they die. Some  English tumblers are almost equally persistent. A writer, quoted by Mr.  Darwin, says that these birds generally begin to tumble almost as soon  as they can fly; \"at three months old they tumble well, but still fly  strong; at five or six months they tumble excessively; and in the second  year they mostly give up flying, on account of their tumbling so much  and so close to the ground. Some fly round with the flock, throwing a  clean summersault every few yards till they are obliged to settle from  giddiness and exhaustion. These are called Air-tumblers, and they  commonly throw from twenty to thirty summersaults in a minute, each  clear and clean. I have one red cock that I have on two or three  occasions timed by my watch, and counted forty summersaults in the  minute. At first they throw a single summersault, then it is double,  till it becomes a continuous roll, which puts an end to flying, for if  they fly a few yards over they go, and roll till they reach the ground.  Thus I had one kill herself, and another broke his leg. Many of them  turn over only a few inches from the ground, and will tumble two or  three times in flying across their loft. These are called House-tumblers  from tumbling in the house. The act of tumbling seems to be one over  which they have no control, an involuntary movement which they seem to  try to prevent. I have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard  or two straight upwards, the impulse forcing him backwards while he  struggles to go forwards.\"[34]    The Short-faced tumblers are an improved sub-race which have almost lost  the power of tumbling, but are valued for possessing some other  characteristics in an extreme degree. They are very small, have almost  globular heads, and a very minute beak, so that fanciers say the head of  a perfect bird should resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it.  Some of these weigh less than seven ounces, whereas the wild rock-pigeon  weighs about fourteen ounces. The "]]]
