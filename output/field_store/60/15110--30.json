Relatively Undifferentiated State of the Sexual Impulse in Early Life--The  Freudian View--Homosexuality in Schools--The Question of Acquired  Homosexuality--Latent Inversion--Retarded Inversion--Bisexuality--The  Question of the Invert's Truthfulness--Histories.      When the sexual instinct first appears in early youth, it is much less  specialized than normally it becomes later. Not only is it, at the outset,  less definitely directed to a specific sexual end, but even the sex of its  object is sometimes uncertain.[124] This has always been so well  recognized that those in authority over young men have sometimes forced  women upon them to avoid the risk of possible unnatural offenses.[125]    The institution which presents these phenomena to us in the most marked  and the most important manner is, naturally, the school, in England  especially the Public School. In France, where the same phenomena are  noted, Tarde called attention to these relationships, \"most usually  Platonic in the primitive meaning of the word, which indicate a simple  indecision of frontier between friendship and love, still undifferentiated  in the dawn of the awakening heart,\" and he regretted that no one had  studied them. In England we are very familiar with vague allusions to the  vices of public schools. From time to time we read letters in the  newspapers denouncing public schools as \"hot-beds of vice\" and one  anonymous writer remarks that \"some of our public schools almost provoke  the punishment of the cities of the Plain.\"[126] But these allegations are  rarely or never submitted to accurate investigation. The physicians and  masters of public schools who are in a position to study the matter  usually possess no psychological training, and appear to view  homosexuality with too much disgust to care to pay any careful attention  to it. What knowledge they possess they keep to themselves, for it is  considered to be in the interests of public schools that these things  should be hushed up. When anything very scandalous occurs one or two lads  are expelled, to their own grave and, perhaps, lifelong injury, and  without benefit to those who remain, whose awakening sexual life rarely  receives intelligent sympathy.        In several of the Histories which follow in this chapter, as well      as in Histories contained in other volumes of these _Studies_,      details will be found concerning homosexuality as it occurs in      English schools, public or private. (See also the study      \"Auto-erotism\" in vol. i.) The prevalence of homosexual and      erotic phenomena in schools varies greatly at different schools      and at different times in the same school, while in small private      schools such phenomena may be entirely unknown. As an English      schoolboy I never myself saw or heard anything of such practices,      and in Germany, Professor Gurlitt (_Die Neue Generation_,      January, 1909), among others, testifies to similar absence of      experience during his whole school life, although there was much      talk and joking among the boys over sexual things. I have added      some observations by a correspondent whose experiences of English      public school life are still recent:--        \"In the years I was a member of a public school, I saw and heard      a good deal of homosexuality, though till my last two years I did      not understand its meaning. As a prefect, I discussed with other      prefects the methods of checking it, and of punishing it when      detected. My own observations, supported by those of others, led      me to think that the fault of the usual method of dealing with      homosexuality in schools is that it regards all school      homosexualists as being in one class together, and has only one      way of dealing with them--the birch for a first offense,      expulsion for a second. Now, I think we may distinguish _three_      classes of school homosexualists:--        \"(a) A very small number who are probably radically inverted, and      who do not scruple to sacrifice young and innocent boys to their      passions. These, and these only, are a real moral danger to      others, and I believe them to be rare.        \"(b) Boys of various ages who, having been initiated into the      passive part in their young days, continue practices of an active      or passive kind; but only with boys already known to be      homosexualists; they draw the line at corrupting fresh victims.      This class realize more or less what they are about, but cannot      be called a danger to the morals of pure boys.        \"(c) Young boys who, whether in the development of their own      physical nature, or by the instruction of older boys of the class      (a), find out the pleasures of masturbation or intercrural      connection. (I never heard of a case of _pedicatio_ at my school,      and only once of _fellatio_, which was attempted on a quite young      boy, who complained to his house master, and the offender was      expelled). Boys in this class have probably little or no idea of      what sexual morality means, and can hardly be accused of a      _moral_ offense at all.        \"I submit that these three classes should receive quite different      treatment. Expulsion may occasionally be necessary for class (a),      but the few who belong to this class are usually too cunning to      get caught. It used to be notorious at school that it was almost      always the wrong people who got dropped on. I do not think a boy      in the other two classes should ever be expelled, and even when      expulsion is unavoidable, it should, if possible, be deferred      till the end of the term, so as to make it indistinguishable from      an ordinary departure. After all, there is no reason to ruin a      boy's prospects because he is a little beast at sixteen; there      are very few hopeless incorrigibles at that age.        \"As regards the other two classes, I should begin by giving boys      very much fuller enlightenment on sexual subjects than is usually      done, before they go to a public school at all. Either a boy is      pitchforked into the place in utter innocence and ignorance, and      yields to temptations to do things which he vaguely, if at all,      realizes are wrong, and that only because a puzzling sort of      instinct tells him so; or else he is given just enough      information to whet his curiosity, usually in the shape of      warnings against certain apparently harmless bodily acts, which      he not unnaturally tries out of curiosity, and finds them very      pleasant. It may be undesirable that a boy should have full      knowledge, at the time he goes to school, but it is more      undesirable that he should go with a burning curiosity, or a      total ignorance on the subject. I am convinced that much might      be done in the way of prevention if boys were told more, and      allowed to be _open_. Much of the pleasure of sexual talk among      boys I believe to be due to the spurious interest aroused by the      fact that it is forbidden fruit, and involves risk if caught. It      seems to me that frankness is far more moral than suggestion. I      would not 'expurgate' school editions of great authors; the frank      obscenity of parts of Shakespeare is far less immoral than the      prurient prudishness which declines to print it, but numbers the      lines in such a way that the boy can go home and look up the      omitted passage in a complete edition, with a distinct sense of      guilt, which is where the harm comes in.\"        It is probable that only a small proportion of homosexual boys in      schools can properly be described as \"vicious.\" A. Hoche,      describing homosexuality in German schools (\"Zuer Frage der      forensischen Beurteilung sexuellen Vergehen,\" _Neurologisches      Centralblatt_, 1896, No. 2), and putting together communications      received from various medical men regarding their own youthful      experiences at school, finds relationships of the kind very      common, usually between boys of different ages and      school-classes. According to one observer, the feminine, or      passive, part was always played by a boy of girlish form and      complexion, and the relationships were somewhat like those of      normal lovers, with kissing, poems, love-letters, scenes of      jealousy, sometimes visits to each other in bed, but without      masturbation, pederasty, or other grossly physical      manifestations. From his own youthful experience Hoche records      precisely similar observations, and remarks that the lovers were      by no means recruited from the vicious elements in the school.      (The elder scholars, of 21 or 22 years of age, formed regular      sexual relationships with the servant-girls in the house.) It is      probable that the homosexual relationships in English schools      are, as a rule, not more vicious than those described by Hoche,      but that the concealment in which they are wrapped leads to      exaggeration. In the course of a discussion on this matter over      thirty years ago, \"Olim Etoniensis\" wrote (_Journal of      Education_, 1882, p. 85) that, on making a list of the vicious      boys he had known at Eton, he found that \"these very boys had      become cabinet ministers, statesmen, officers, clergymen,      country-gentlemen, etc., and that they are nearly all of them      fathers of thriving families, respected and prosperous.\" But, as      Marro has remarked, the question is not thus settled. Public      distinction by no means necessarily implies any fine degree of      private morality.        Sometimes the manifestations thus appearing in schools or      wherever youths are congregated together are not truly      homosexual, but exhibit a more or less brutal or even sadistic      perversion of the immature sexual instinct."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#20)"],[1,"omen, during life about the same amount of force is necessary in  both sexes; so that a greater amount of energy flows to the bladder in  women, and any nervous storm or disturbance is thus specially apt to  affect the bladder.    [58] \"Every pain,\" remarks Marie de Manaceine, \"produces a number of  movements which are apparently useless: we cry out, we groan, we move our  limbs, we throw ourselves from one side to the other, and at bottom all  these movements are logical because by interrupting and breaking our  attention they render us less sensitive to the pain. In the days before  chloroform, skillful surgeons requested their patients to cry out during  the operation, as we are told by Gratiolet, who could not explain so  strange a fact, for in his time the antagonism of movements and attention  was not recognized.\" (Marie de Manaceine, _Archives Italiennes de  Biologie_, 1894, p. 250.) This antagonism of attention by movement is but  another way of expressing the vicarious relationship of motor discharges.    [59] Joanny Roux, _Psychologie de l'Instinct Sexuel_, 1899, pp. 22-23. It  is disputed whether hunger is located in the whole organism, and powerful  arguments have been brought against the view. (W. Cannon, \"The Nature of  Hunger,\" _Popular Science Monthly_, Sept., 1912.) Thirst is usually  regarded as organic (A. Mayer, _La Soif_, 1901).    [60] If there is any objection to these terms it is chiefly because they  have reference to vascular congestion rather than to the underlying  nervous charging and discharging, which is equally fundamental, and in man  more prominent than the vascular phenomena.          LOVE AND PAIN.    I.    The Chief Key to the Relationship between Love and Pain to be Found in  Animal Courtship--Courtship a Source of Combativity and of Cruelty--Human  Play in the Light of Animal Courtship--The Frequency of Crimes Against the  Person in Adolescence--Marriage by Capture and its Psychological  Basis--Man's Pleasure in Exerting Force and Woman's Pleasure in  Experiencing it--Resemblance of Love to Pain even in Outward  Expression--The Love-bite--In what Sense Pain may be Pleasurable--The  Natural Contradiction in the Emotional Attitude of Women Toward  Men--Relative Insensibility to Pain of the Organic Sexual Sphere in  Women--The Significance of the Use of the Ampallang and Similar Appliances  in Coitus--The Sexual Subjection of Women to Men in Part Explainable as  the Necessary Condition for Sexual Pleasure.      The relation of love to pain is one of the most difficult problems, and  yet one of the most fundamental, in the whole range of sexual psychology.  Why is it that love inflicts, and even seeks to inflict, pain? Why is it  that love suffers pain, and even seeks to suffer it? In answering that  question, it seems to me, we have to take an apparently circuitous route,  sometimes going beyond the ostensible limits of sex altogether; but if we  can succeed in answering it we shall have come very near one of the great  mysteries of love. At the same time we shall have made clear the normal  basis on which rest the extreme aberrations of love.    The chief key to the relationship of love to pain is to be found by  returning to the consideration of the essential phenomena of courtship in  the animal world generally. Courtship is a play, a game; even its combats  are often, to a large extent, mock-combats; but the process behind it is  one of terrible earnestness, and the play may at any moment become deadly.  Courtship tends to involve a mock-combat between males for the possession  of the female which may at any time become a real combat; it is a pursuit  of the female by the male which may at any time become a kind of  persecution; so that, as Colin Scott remarks, \"Courting may be looked upon  as a refined and delicate form of combat.\" The note of courtship, more  especially among mammals, is very easily forced, and as soon as we force  it we reach pain.[61] The intimate and inevitable association in the  animal world of combat--of the fighting and hunting impulses--with the  process of courtship alone suffices to bring love into close connection  with pain.    Among mammals the male wins the female very largely by the display of  force. The infliction of pain must inevitably be a frequent indirect  result of the exertion of power. It is even more than this; the infliction  of pain by the male on the female may itself be a gratification of the  impulse to exert force. This tendency has always to be held in check, for  it is of the essence of courtship that the male should win the female, and  she can only be won by the promise of pleasure. The tendency of the male  to inflict pain must be restrained, so far as the female is concerned, by  the consideration of what is pleasing to her. Yet, the more carefully we  study the essential elements of courtship, the clearer it becomes that,  playful as these manifestations may seem on the surface, in every  direction they are verging on pain. It is so among animals generally; it  is so in man among savages. \"It is precisely the alliance of pleasure and  pain,\" wrote the physiologist Burdach, \"which constitutes the voluptuous  emotion.\"    Nor is this emotional attitude entirely confined to the male. The female  also in courtship delights to arouse to the highest degree in the male the  desire for her favors and to withhold those favors from him, thus finding  on her part also the enjoyment of power in cruelty. \"One's cruelty is  one's power,\" Millament says in Congreve's _Way of the World_, \"and when  one parts with one's cruelty one parts with one's power.\"    At the outset, then, the impulse to inflict pain is brought into  courtship, and at the same time rendered a pleasurable idea to the female,  because with primitive man, as well as among his immediate ancestors, the  victor in love has been the bravest and strongest rather than the most  beautiful or the most skilful. Until he can fight he is not reckoned a man  and he cannot hope to win a woman. Among the African Masai a man is not  supposed to marry until he has blooded his spear, and in a very different  part of the world, among the Dyaks of Borneo, there can be little doubt  that the chief incentive to head-hunting is the desire to please the  women, the possession of a head decapitated by himself being an excellent  way of winning a maiden's favor.[62] Such instances are too well known to  need multiplication here, and they survive in civilization, for, even  among ourselves, although courtship is now chiefly ruled by quite other  considerations, most women are in some degree emotionally affected by  strength and courage. But the direct result of this is that a group of  phenomena with which cruelty and the infliction of pain must inevitably be  more or less allied is brought within the sphere of courtship and rendered  agreeable to women. Here, indeed, we have the source of that love of  cruelty which some have found so marked in women. This is a phase of  courtship which helps us to understand how it is that, as we shall see,  the idea of pain, having become associated with sexual emotion, may be  pleasurable to women.    Thus, in order to understand the connection between love and pain, we have  once more to return to the consideration, under a somewhat new aspect, of  the fundamental elements in the sexual impulse. In discussing the  \"Evolution of Modesty\" we found that the primary part of the female in  courtship is the playful, yet serious, assumption of the role of a hunted  animal who lures on the pursuer, not with the object of escaping, but with  the object of being finally caught. In considering the \"Analysis of the  Sexual Impulse\" we found that the primary part of the male in courtship is  by the display of his energy and skill to capture the female or to arouse  in her an emotional condition which leads her to surrender herself to him,  this process itself at the same time heightening his own excitement. In  the playing of these two different parts is attained in both male and  female that charging of nervous energy, that degree of vascular  tumescence, necessary for adequate discharge and detumescence in an  explosion by which sperm-cells and germ-cells are brought together for the  propagation of the race. We are now concerned with the necessary interplay  of the differing male and female roles in courtship, and with their  accidental emotional by-products. Both male and female are instinctively  seeking the same end of sexual union at the moment of highest excitement.  There cannot, therefore, be real conflict.[63] But there is the semblance  of a conflict, an apparent clash of aim, an appearance of cruelty.  Moreover,--and this is a significant moment in the process from our  present point of view,--when there are rivals for the possession of one  female there is always a possibility of actual combat, so tending to  introduce an element of real violence, of undisguised cruelty, which the  male inflicts on his rival and which the female views with satisfaction  and delight in the prowess of the successful claimant. Here we are brought  close to the zooelogical root of the connection between love and pain.[64]    In his admirable work on play in man Groos has fully discussed the plays  of combat (_Kampfspiele_), which begin to develop even in childhood and  assume full activity during adolescence; and he points out that, while the  impulse to such play certainly has a wider biological significance, it  still possesses a relationship to the sexual life and to the rivalries of  animals in courtship which must not be forgotten.[65]    Nor is it only in play that the connection between love and combativity  may still be traced. With the epoch of the first sexual relationship,  Marro points out, awakes the instinct of cruelty, which prompts the youth  to acts which are sometimes in absolute contrast to his previous conduct,  and leads him to be careless"]]]
