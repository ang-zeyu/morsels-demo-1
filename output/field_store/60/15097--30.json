I have not the data of the number killed this day, but it was    hundreds.      On the 28th, twenty-two stepped over and were promptly executed.    Like Custer's band, not one escaped. On the evening of the 28th, 600    were sighted just over the line, and the army of 125 brave men    entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next    morning. Before daylight of the 29th the battle began. The elk were    over the line, feeding on Buffalo Flats. One hundred and twenty-five    men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red    with blood and strewn with carcasses, and in their madness they shot    each other. One man was shot through the ear,--a close call; another    received a bullet through his coat sleeve, and another was shot    through the bowels and can't live.      My informer told me he participated in the slaughter, and while he    would not take fifty dollars for what he saw, and the experience he    went through, yet he would not go through it again for $1,000. When    my informer got back to Gardiner that day there were four sleigh    loads of elk, each load containing from twenty to thirty-five elk,    besides thirty-two mules and horses carrying one to two each. This    was only a part of the slaughter. Hundreds more were carried to    other points; and this was only one day's work.      Hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die, and    others died outside the park. The station at Livingston, Montana,    for a week looked like a packing house. Carcasses were piled up on    the trucks and depot platform. The baggage cars were loaded with elk    going to points east and west of Livingston.      Maybe this is all right. Maybe the government can't stop the elk    from crossing the line. Maybe the elk were helped over; but it    strikes me there is something wrong somewhere.    THE DIVISION OF HIRED LABORERS.--The scourge of lumber-camps in big-game  territory, the mining camps and the railroad-builders is a long story,  and if told in detail it would make several chapters. Their awful  destructiveness is well known. It is a common thing for \"the boss\" to  hire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit, and save  beef and pork.    The abuses arising from this source easily could be checked, and finally  suppressed. A ten-line law would do the business,--forbidding any person  employed in any camp of sheep men, cattle men, lumbermen, miners,  railway laborers or excavators to own or use a rifle in hunting wild  game; and forbidding any employer of labor to feed those laborers, or  permit them to be fed, on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds.  \"Camp\" laborers are not \"pioneers;\" not by a long shot! They are  soldiers of Commerce, and makers of money.    A MOUNTAIN SHEEP CASE IN COLORADO.--The state of Colorado sincerely  desires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep,  but as usual the Lawless Miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts of  the guardians of the game. Every state that strives to protect its big  game has such doings as this to contend with:    In the winter of 1911-12, a resident poacher brought into Grant,  Colorado, a lot of mountain sheep meat _for sale_; and he actually sold  it to residents of that town! The price was _six cents per pound_. A lot  of it was purchased by the railway station-agent. I have no doubt that  the same man who did that job, which was made possible only by the  co-operation of the citizens of Grant, will try the same  poaching-and-selling game next winter, unless the State Game  Commissioner is able to bring him to book.    A WYOMING CASE IN POINT.--As a fair sample of what game wardens, and the  general public, are sometimes compelled to endure through the improper  decisions of judges, I will cite this case:    In the Shoshone Mountains of northern Wyoming, about fifty miles or so  from the town of Cody, in the winter of 1911-12 a man was engaged in  trapping coyotes. It was currently reported that he had been \"driven out  of Montana and Idaho.\" He had scores of traps. He baited his traps with  the flesh of deer, elk calves and grouse, all illegally killed and  illegally used for that purpose. A man of my acquaintance saw some of  this game meat actually used as described.    The man was a notorious character, and cruel in the extreme. Finally a  game warden caught him red-handed, arrested him, and took him to Cody  for trial. It happened that the judge on the bench had once trapped with  him, and therefore \"he set the game-killer free, while the game-warden  was roasted.\"    That wolf-trapper once took into the mountains a horse, to kill and use  as bear-bait. The animal was blind in one eye, and because it would not  graze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain, he deliberately  destroyed the sight of its good eye, and left it for days, without the  ability to find water.    Think of the fate of any wild animal that unkind Fate places at the  mercy of such a man!           *        *        *        *        *    CHAPTER VIII    UNSEEN FOES OF WILD LIFE      Quite unintentionally on his part, Man, the arch destroyer and the most  predatory and merciless of all animal species except the wolves, has  rendered a great service to all the birds that live or nest upon the  ground. His relentless pursuit and destruction of the savage-tempered,  strong-jawed fur-bearing animals is in part the salvation of the ground  birds of to-day and yesterday. If the teeth and claws had been permitted  to multiply unchecked down to the present time, with man's warfare on  the upland game proceeding as it has done, scores upon scores of species  long ere this would have been exterminated.    But the slaughter of the millions of North American foxes, wolves,  weasels, skunks, and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the four-footed  enemies of the birds that the balance of wild Nature has been preserved.  As a rule, the few predatory wild animals that remain are not  slaughtering the birds to a serious extent; and for this we may well be  thankful.    THE DOMESTIC CAT.--In such thickly settled communities as our northern  states, from the Atlantic coast to the sandhills of Kansas and Nebraska,  the domestic cat is probably the greatest four-footed scourge of bird  life. Thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in action  will doubt this statement, but the proof of its truthfulness is only too  painfully abundant.    Unhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen, and to kill  the very birds that are most friendly with man, and most helpful to him  in his farming and fruit-growing business. The quail is about the only  game bird that the cat affects seriously, and to it the cat is very  destructive. It is the robin, catbird, thrush, bluebird, dove,  woodpecker, chickadee, phoebe, tanager and other birds of the lawn, the  garden and orchard that afford good hunting for sly and savage old  Thomas.    When I was a boy in my 'teens, I had a lasting series of object lessons  on the cat as a predatory animal. Our \"Betty\" was the most ambitious and  successful domestic-cat hunter of wild mammals of which I ever have  heard. To her, rats and mice were mere child's-play, and after a time  their pursuit offered such tame sport that she sought fresh fields for  her prowess. Then she brought in young rabbits, chipmunks and  thirteen-lined spermophiles, and once she came in, quite exhausted, half  dragging and half carrying a big, fat pocket gopher. With her it seemed  to be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and display it.  Little did we realize then that in course of time the wild birds would  become so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demand  legislative action in the states.    In considering the hunting cat, let us call in a credible witness of the  effects of domestic cats on the bob white. The following is an  eye-witness report, by Ernest B. Beardsley, in _Outdoor Life_ for April,  1912. The locality was Wellington, Sumner County, Kansas.      In the meantime, old Queen was having a high old time up ahead, some    hundred feet by then, running up the bank and back down in the draw.    We had hardly caught up when up goes Mr. Savage's gun and he gives    both barrels. I had seen nothing up to date, but I didn't have long    to wait, for by the time I got up to him and the dog, they were both    in the high grass and had a great, big, common gray maltese    house-cat; and Queen had a half-eaten quail that Mr. Cat was busy    with when disturbed.      Well, we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey    of sixteen that had been ahead of Mr. Cat; and about four o'clock    that evening we killed another white-and-gray cat. While driving    home that night, Mr. Savage told me that he had killed fifty or more    in three or four years. They will get in a draw full of    tumble-grass, on a cold day when quail don't like to fly, and stay    right with them; and even after feeding on two or three, they will    lie and watch, and when the covey moves, they move. When eating time    comes around they are at it again, and to a covey of young birds    they are sure death to the whole covey.      Well, Will told me never to overlook a house-cat that I found as far    as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch, for if they have not    already turned wild, they are learning how easy it is to hunt and    live on game, and are almost as bad. We found Mr. Black-and-White    Hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening. I    would rather not write what Mr. Savage said when we found the    remains of a partly-eaten bird.      My advice is, don't let tame cats get away when found out hunting;    for the chances are they have not seen a home in months, and maybe    years,--and say! but they do get big and bad. When you meet one,    give it to him good, and don't let your dog run up to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13268"],[0,"Hindu literature : Comprising The Book of good counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The (#20)"],[1,"     Is of these world-protectors. From a heart      Full friendly cometh what I tell thee now.\"        Unto Nishadha's Prince the maid replied--      Tears of distress dimming her lustrous eyes---      \"Humbly I reverence these mighty gods;      But thee I choose, and thee I take for lord;      And this I vow!\"                       With folded palms she stood,      And trembling lips, while his faint answer fell:--      \"Sent on such embassy, how shall I dare      Speak, sweetest Princess, for myself to thee?      Bound by my promise for the gods to sue,      How can I be a suitor for myself?      Silence is here my duty; afterwards,      If I shall come, in mine own name I'll come,      Mine own cause pleading. Ah, might that so be!\"        Checking her tears, Damayanti sadly smiled,      And said full soft: \"One way of hope I see,      A blameless way, O Lord of men! wherefrom      No fault shall rise, nor any danger fall.      Thou also, Prince, with Indra and these gods,      Must enter in where my Swayamvara      Is held; then I, in presence of those gods,      Will choose thee, dearest, for my lord; and so      Blame shall not light on thee,\"                                      With which sweet words      Soft in his ears, Nishadha straight returned      There where the gods were gathered, waiting him;      Whom the world's masters, on his way, perceived,      And, spying, questioned, asking for his news:--      \"Saw'st thou her, Prince? Didst see the sweet-lipped one?      What spake she of us? Tell us true; tell all!\"        Quoth Nala: \"By your worshipful behest      Sent to her house, the great gates entered I,      Though the gray porters watched; but none might spy      My entering, by your power, O radiant Ones,      Saving the Raja's daughter; her I saw      Amid her maidens, and by them was seen.      On me with much amazement they did gaze      Whilst I your high Divinities extolled.      But she that hath the lovely face, with mind      Set upon me, hath chosen me, ye Gods.      For thus she spake, my Princess: 'Let them come,      And come thou, like a lordly tiger, too,      Unto the place of my Swayamvara;      There will I choose thee in their presence, Prince,      To be my lord; and so there will not fall      Blame, thou strong-armed! to thee,' This she did say      Even as I tell it; and what shall be next,      To will is yours, O ye immortal Ones!\"        Soon, when the moon was good, and day and hour      Were found propitious, Bhima, King of men,      Summoned the chiefs to the Swayamvara;      Upon which message all those eager lords      For love of Damayanti hastened there.      Glorious with gilded pillars was the court,      Whereto a gate-house opened, and thereby      Into the square, like lions from the hills,      Paced the proud guests; and there their seats they took,      Each in his rank, the masters of the lands,      With crowns of fragrant blossoms garlanded,      And polished jewels swinging in their ears.      Of some the thews, knitted and rough, stood forth      Like iron maces; some had slender limbs,      Sleek and fine-turned like the five-headed snake;      Lords with long-flowing hair; glittering lords;      High-nosed, and eagle-eyed, and heavy-browed;      The faces of those kings shone in a ring      As shine at night the stars; and that great square      As thronged with Rajas was as Naga-land      Is full of serpents; thick with warlike chiefs      As mountain-caves with panthers. Unto these      Entered, in matchless majesty of form,      The Princess Damayanti. As she came,      The glory of her ravished eyes and hearts,      So that the gaze of all those haughty kings,      Fastening upon her loveliness, grew fixed--      Not moving save with her--step after step      Onward and always following the maid.        But while the styles and dignities of all      Were cried aloud (O son of Bharat!), lo!      The Princess marked five of that throng alike      In form and garb and visage. There they stood,      Each from the next undifferenced, but each      Nala's own self;--yet which might Nala be      In nowise could that doubting maid descry.      Who took her eye seemed Nala while she gazed,      Until she looked upon his like; and so      Pondered the lovely lady, sore-perplexed,      Thinking, \"How shall I tell which be the gods,      And which is noble Nala?\" Deep-distressed      And meditative waxed she, musing hard      What those signs were, delivered us of old,      Whereby gods may be known: \"Of all those signs      Taught by our elders, lo! I see not one      Where stand yon five.\" So murmured she, and turned      Over and over every mark she knew.      At last, resolved to make the gods themselves      Her help at need, with reverent air and voice      Humbly saluted she those heavenly ones,      And with joined palms and trembling accents spake:--      \"As, when I heard the swans, I chose my Prince,      By that sincerity I call ye, Gods,      To show my Love to me and make me know!      As in my heart and soul and speech I stand      True to my choice, by that sincerity      I call the all-knowing gods to make me know!      As the high gods created Nishadha's chief      To be my lord, by their sincerity      I bid them show themselves, and make me know!      As my vow, sealed to him, must be maintained      For his name, and for mine, I call the gods      By such sincerity to make me know!      Let them appear, the masters of the world--      The high gods--each one in his proper shape,      That I may see Nishadha's chief, my choice,      Whom minstrels praise, and Damayanti loves.\"        Hearing that earnest speech--so passion-fraught,      So full of truth, of strong resolve, of love,      Of singleness of soul and constancy--      Even as she spake, the gods disclosed themselves.      By well-seen signs the effulgent Ones she knew.      Shadowless stood they, with unwinking eyes,      And skins which never moist with sweat; their feet      Light-gliding o'er the ground, not touching it;      The unfading blossoms on their brows not soiled      By earthly dust, but ever fair and fresh.      Whilst, by their side, garbed so and visaged so,      But doubled by his shadow, stained with dust,      The flower-cups wiltering in his wreath, his skin      Pearly with sweat, his feet upon the earth,      And eyes a-wink, stood Nala. One by one      Glanced she on those divinities, then bent      Her gaze upon the Prince, and, joyous, said:--      \"I know thee, and I name my rightful lord,      Taking Nishadha's chief.\" Therewith she drew      Modestly nigh, and held him by the cloth,      With large eyes beaming love, and round his neck      Hung the bright chaplet, love's delicious crown;      So choosing him--him only--whom she named      Before the face of all to be her lord.        Oh, then brake forth from all those suitors proud,      \"Ha!\" and \"Aho!\" But from the gods and saints,      \"Sadhu! well done! well done!\" And all admired      The happy Prince, praising the grace of him;      While Virasena's son, delightedly,      Spake to the slender-waisted these fond words:--      \"Fair Princess! since, before all gods and men,      Thou makest me thy choice, right glad am I      Of this thy mind, and true lord will I be.      For so long, loveliest, as my breath endures,      Thine am I! Thus I plight my troth to thee.\"      So, with joined palms, unto that beauteous maid      His gentle faith he pledged, rejoicing her;      And, hand in hand, radiant with mutual love,      Before great Agni and the gods they passed,      The world's protectors worshipping.                                         Then those,      The lords of life, the powerful Ones, bestowed--      Being well-pleased--on Nala, chosen so,      Eight noble boons. The boon which Indra gave      Was grace, at times of sacrifice, to see      The visible god approach, with step divine;      And Agni's boon was this, that he would come      Whenever Nala called--for everywhere      Hutasa shineth, and all worlds are his;      Yama gave skill in cookery, steadfastness      In virtue; and Varuna, King of Floods,      Bade all the waters ripple at his call.      These boons the high gods doubled by the gift      Of bright wreaths wove with magic blooms of heaven;      And those bestowed, ascended to their seats.      Also with wonder and with joy returned      The Rajas and the Maharajas all,      Full of the marriage-feast; for Bhima made,      In pride and pleasure, stately nuptials;      So Damayanti and the Prince were wed.        Then, having tarried as is wont, that lord--      Nishadha's chief--took the King's leave, and went      Unto his city, bringing home with him      His jewel of all womanhood, with whom      Blissful he lived, as lives by Sachi's side      The slayer of the Demons. Like a sun      Shone Nala on his throne, ruling his folk      In strength and virtue, guardian of his state.      Also the Aswamedha Rite he made      Greatest of rites, the Offering of the Horse,      As did Yayati; and all other acts      Of worship; and to sages gave rich gifts.        Many dear days of much delicious love,      In pleasant gardens and in shadowy groves,      Passed they together, sojourning like gods.      And Damayanti bore unto her lord      A boy named Indrasen, and next, a girl      Named Indrasena. So in happiness      The good Prince governed, seeing all his lands      Wealthy and well, in piety and peace.        Now at the choosing of Nishadha's chief      By Bhima's daughter, when those lords of life--      The effulgent gods--departed, Dwapara      They saw with Kali, coming. Indra said--      The Demon-slayer--spying these approach:--      \"Whither, with Dwapara, goest thou to-day,      O Kali?\" And the sombre Shade replied:--      \"To Damayanti's high Swayamvara      I go, to make her mine, since she hath passed      Into my heart.\" But Indra, laughing,"]]]
