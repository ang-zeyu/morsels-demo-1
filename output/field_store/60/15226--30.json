If anywhere, there would have been  the place to indicate, had such been the author's view, that Brahman is  the material cause of the world through Maya only, and that the world is  unreal; but the Sutras do not contain a single word to that effect.  Sutra 26, on the other hand, exhibits the significant term  'pari/n/amat;' Brahman produces the world by means of a modification of  itself. It is well known that later on, when the terminology of the  Vedanta became definitely settled, the term 'pari/n/avada' was used to  denote that very theory to which the followers of /S/a@nkara are most  violently opposed, viz. the doctrine according to which the world is not  a mere vivarta, i.e. an illusory manifestation of Brahman, but the  effect of Brahman undergoing a real change, may that change be conceived  to take place in the way taught by Ramanuja or in some other  manner.--With regard to the last-quoted Sutra, as well as to those  touched upon above, the commentators indeed maintain that whatever terms  and modes of expression are apparently opposed to the vivartavada are in  reality reconcilable with it; to Sutra 26, for instance, Govindananda  remarks that the term 'pari/n/ama' only denotes an effect in general  (karyamatra), without implying that the effect is real. But in cases of  this nature we are fully entitled to use our own judgment, even if we  were not compelled to do so by the fact that other commentators, such as  Ramanuja, are satisfied to take 'pari/n/ama' and similar terms in their  generally received sense.    A further section treating of the nature of Brahman is met with in III,  2, 11 ff. It is, according to /S/a@nkara's view, of special importance,  as it is alleged to set forth that Brahman is in itself destitute of all  qualities, and is affected with qualities only through its limiting  adjuncts (upadhis), the offspring of Maya. I have above (in the  conspectus of contents) given a somewhat detailed abstract of the whole  section as interpreted by /S/a@nkara on the one hand, and Ramanuja on  the other hand, from which it appears that the latter's opinion as to  the purport of the group of Sutras widely diverges from that of  /S/a@nkara. The wording of the Sutras is so eminently concise and vague  that I find it impossible to decide which of the two commentators--if  indeed either--is to be accepted as a trustworthy guide; regarding the  sense of some Sutras /S/a@nkara's explanation seems to deserve  preference, in the case of others Ramanuja seems to keep closer to the  text. I decidedly prefer, for instance, Ramanuja's interpretation of  Sutra 22, as far as the sense of the entire Sutra is concerned, and more  especially with regard to the term 'prak/ri/taitavattvam,' whose proper  force is brought out by Ramanuja's explanation only. So much is certain  that none of the Sutras decidedly favours the interpretation proposed by  /S/a@nkara. Whichever commentator we follow, we greatly miss coherence  and strictness of reasoning, and it is thus by no means improbable that  the section is one of those--perhaps not few in number--in which both  interpreters had less regard to the literal sense of the words and to  tradition than to their desire of forcing Badaraya/n/a's Sutras to bear  testimony to the truth of their own philosophic theories.    With special reference to the Maya doctrine one important Sutra has yet  to be considered, the only one in which the term 'maya' itself occurs,  viz. III, 2, 3. According to /S/a@nkara the Sutra signifies that the  environments of the dreaming soul are not real but mere Maya, i.e.  unsubstantial illusion, because they do not fully manifest the character  of real objects. Ramanuja (as we have seen in the conspectus) gives a  different explanation of the term 'maya,' but in judging of /S/a@nkara's  views we may for the time accept /S/a@nkara's own interpretation. Now,  from the latter it clearly follows that if the objects seen in dreams  are to be called Maya, i.e. illusion, because not evincing the  characteristics of reality, the objective world surrounding the waking  soul must not be called Maya. But that the world perceived by waking men  is Maya, even in a higher sense than the world presented to the dreaming  consciousness, is an undoubted tenet of the /S/a@nkara Vedanta; and the  Sutra therefore proves either that Badaraya/n/a did not hold the  doctrine of the illusory character of the world, or else that, if after  all he did hold that doctrine, he used the term 'maya' in a sense  altogether different from that in which /S/a@nkara employs it.--If, on  the other hand, we, with Ramanuja, understand the word 'maya' to denote  a wonderful thing, the Sutra of course has no bearing whatever on the  doctrine of Maya in its later technical sense.    We now turn to the question as to the relation of the individual soul to  Brahman. Do the Sutras indicate anywhere that their author held  /S/a@nkara's doctrine, according to which the jiva is in reality  identical with Brahman, and separated from it, as it were, only by a  false surmise due to avidya, or do they rather favour the view that the  souls, although they have sprung from Brahman, and constitute elements  of its nature, yet enjoy a kind of individual existence apart from it?  This question is in fact only another aspect of the Maya question, but  yet requires a short separate treatment.    In the conspectus I have given it as my opinion that the Sutras in which  the size of the individual soul is discussed can hardly be understood in  /S/a@nkara's sense, and rather seem to favour the opinion, held among  others by Ramanuja, that the soul is of minute size. We have further  seen that Sutra 18 of the third pada of the second adhyaya, which  describes the soul as 'j/n/a,' is more appropriately understood in the  sense assigned to it by Ramanuja; and, again, that the Sutras which  treat of the soul being an agent, can be reconciled with /S/a@nkara's  views only if supplemented in a way which their text does not appear to  authorise.--We next have the important Sutra II, 3, 43 in which the soul  is distinctly said to be a part (a/ms/a) of Brahman, and which, as we  have already noticed, can be made to fall in with /S/a@nkara's views  only if a/ms/a is explained, altogether arbitrarily, by 'a/ms/a iva,'  while Ramanuja is able to take the Sutra as it stands.--We also have  already referred to Sutra 50, 'abhasa eva /k/a,' which /S/a@nkara  interprets as setting forth the so-called pratibimbavada according to  which the individual Self is merely a reflection of the highest Self.  But almost every Sutra--and Sutra 50 forms no exception--being so  obscurely expressed, that viewed by itself it admits of various, often  totally opposed, interpretations, the only safe method is to keep in  view, in the case of each ambiguous aphorism, the general drift and  spirit of the whole work, and that, as we have seen hitherto, is by no  means favourable to the pratibimba doctrine. How indeed could Sutra 50,  if setting forth that latter doctrine, be reconciled with Sutra 43,  which says distinctly that the soul is a part of Brahman? For that 43  contains, as /S/a@nkara and his commentators aver, a statement of the  ava/kkh/edavada, can itself be accepted only if we interpret a/ms/a by  a/ms/a iva, and to do so there is really no valid reason whatever. I  confess that Ramanuja's interpretation of the Sutra (which however is  accepted by several other commentators also) does not appear to me  particularly convincing; and the Sutras unfortunately offer us no other  passages on the ground of which we might settle the meaning to be  ascribed to the term abhasa, which may mean 'reflection,' but may mean  hetvabhasa, i.e. fallacious argument, as well. But as things stand, this  one Sutra cannot, at any rate, be appealed to as proving that the  pratibimbavada which, in its turn, presupposes the mayavada, is the  teaching of the Sutras.    To the conclusion that the Sutrakara did not hold the doctrine of the  absolute identity of the highest and the individual soul in the sense of  /S/a@nkara, we are further led by some other indications to be met with  here and there in the Sutras. In the conspectus of contents we have had  occasion to direct attention to the important Sutra II, 1, 22, which  distinctly enunciates that the Lord is adhika, i.e. additional to, or  different from, the individual soul, since Scripture declares the two to  be different. Analogously I, 2, 20 lays stress on the fact that the  /s/arira is not the antaryamin, because the Madhyandinas, as well as the  Ka/n/vas, speak of him in their texts as different (bhedena enam  adhiyate), and in 22 the /s/arira and the pradhana are referred to as  the two 'others' (itarau) of whom the text predicates distinctive  attributes separating them from the highest Lord. The word 'itara' (the  other one) appears in several other passages (I, 1, 16; I, 3, 16; II, 1,  21) as a kind of technical term denoting the individual soul in  contradistinction from the Lord. The /S/a@nkaras indeed maintain that  all those passages refer to an unreal distinction due to avidya. But  this is just what we should like to see proved, and the proof offered in  no case amounts to more than a reference to the system which demands  that the Sutras should be thus understood. If we accept the  interpretations of the school of /S/a@nkara, it remains altogether  unintelligible why the Sutrakara "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#20)"],[1,"   *       *          THE GERMAN MOBILIZATION.      The clockworks of mobilization; perfect order and quiet  everywhere--General acceptance by all classes and factions of the  necessities of a war not sought by Germany.      The German mobilization was the greatest movement of people that the  world has ever seen. Nearly four million men had to be transported from  every part of the empire to her borders. The manner in which the  population is distributed made this task extremely difficult. Berlin,  Rhenish Westphalia, Upper Silesia and Saxony especially had to send  their contingents in every direction, since the eastern provinces are  more thinly settled and had to have a stronger guard for the borders  immediately. The result was a hurrying to and fro of thousands and  hundreds of thousands of soldiers, besides a flood of civilians who had  to reach their homes as soon as possible. Countries where the population  is more regularly distributed have an easier task than Germany, with its  predominating urban population. The difficulties of the gigantic  undertaking were also increased by the necessity for transporting war  materials of every sort. In the west are chiefly industrial  undertakings, in the east mainly agricultural. Horse raising is mostly  confined to the provinces on the North Sea and the Baltic, but chiefly  to East Prussia, and this province, the furthest away from France, had  to send its best horses to the western border, as did also  Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover. Coal for our warships had to go in the  other direction. From the Rhenish mines it went to the North Sea, from  Upper Silesia to the Baltic. Ammunition and heavy projectiles were  transported from the central part of the empire to the borders. And  everywhere these operations had to be carried on with haste. One can  thus say that the German mobilization was the greatest movement of men  and materials that the world has ever seen.    And how was it carried on? No one could have wondered if there had been  hundreds of unforeseen incidents, if military trains had arrived at  their stations with great delays, if there had resulted in many places a  wild hugger-mugger from the tremendous problems on hand. But there was  not a trace of this. On the Monday evening of the first week of  mobilization a high officer of the General Staff said: \"It had to go  well today, but how about tomorrow, the main day?\" Tuesday evening saw  no reason for complaint, no delay, no requests for instructions. All had  moved with the regularity of clockwork. Regiments that had been ordered  to mobilize in the forenoon left in the evening for the field, fully  equipped. Not a man was lacking. There were no deserters, no shirkers,  no cowards. Instead, there were volunteers whose numbers far exceeded  the number that could be used. Every German wanted to do his duty.    The most noteworthy thing was the earnest quietness with which the  gigantic gathering proceeded. Not a city, not a village reported unrest  or even an untoward incident. The separation was hard for many a  soldier. Many a volunteer tore himself away from his dear ones with  bleeding heart, but with face beaming with the light of one who looks  forward to victory. Following the Kaiser's wish, those who remained  behind filled the churches and, kneeling, prayed to God for victory for  the just German cause. The folk-war, brought on by the wantonness of the  opponents, in itself brought peace and order, safety and discipline.  Never, probably, have the police had fewer excesses to deal with than in  the days of the mobilization, although great crowds gathered constantly  in every city.    The best criterion of the enthusiasm of the people is without doubt the  number of volunteers. More than 1,000,000 of these, a number greater  than that of the standing army, presented themselves within a few days.  They came from all classes. There were sons of the nobility, university  students, farmers, merchants, common laborers. No calling hung back.  Every young man sorrowed when he was rejected. No section of the  Fatherland was unrepresented, not even the Reichsland Alsace-Lorraine,  where, indeed, the number of volunteers was conspicuously great. When  the lists in various cities had to be closed, the young men who had not  been accepted turned away with tears in their eyes, and telegraphed from  regiment to regiment, hoping to find one where there were still  vacancies. Where the sons of the wealthy renounced the pleasures of  youth and the comforts of their homes to accept the hardships of war in  serving the Fatherland, the poor and the poorest appeared in like  degree. In families having four or five sons subject to military duty a  youngest son, not yet liable for service, volunteered. The year 1870,  truly a proud year in our history, saw nothing like this.    A thing that raised the national enthusiasm still higher was the  appearance of the troops in brand-new uniforms, complete from head to  foot. The first sight of these new uniforms of modest field gray,  faultlessly made, evoked everywhere the question: Where did they come  from? On the first day of mobilization dozens of cloth manufacturers  appeared at the War Ministry with offers of the new material. \"We don't  need any,\" was the astonishing reply. Equal amazement was caused by the  faultless new boots and shoes of the troops, especially in view of the  recent famous \"boot speech\" of the French Senator Humbert.    Small arms, cannons, and ammunition are so plentiful that they have  merely to be unpacked. In view of all this, it is no wonder that the  regiments marching in were everywhere greeted with jubilation, and that  those marching out took leave of their garrisons with joyful songs. No  one thinks of death and destruction, every one of victory and a happy  reunion. German discipline, once so slandered, now celebrates its  triumph.    There was still another matter in which the troops gave their countrymen  cause for rejoicing. Not one drunken man was seen during these earnest  days in the city streets. The General Staff had, moreover, wisely  ordered that during the mobilization, when every one had money in his  pockets, alcoholic drinks were not to be sold at the railroad stations.  Despite this, the soldiers did not lack for refreshments on their  journey. Women and girls offered their services to the Red Cross, and  there was no station where coffee, tea, milk, and substantial food were  not at the disposal of the soldiers. They were not required to suffer  hunger or any other discomfort. The German anti-alcoholists are  rejoicing at this earnest tribute to their principles, which were at  first laughed at and then pitied, but triumphed in the days of the  mobilization.    The army is increased to many times its ordinary strength by the  mobilization. It draws from everywhere millions of soldiers, workmen,  horses, wagons, and other material. The entire railway service is at its  disposal. The mobilization of the fleet goes on more quietly and less  conspicuously, but not less orderly and smoothly. Indeed, it is, even in  peace times, practically mobilized as to its greatest and strongest  units. For this reason its transports are smaller than those of the  army; they are concentrated in a few harbors, and, therefore, do not  attract so much public attention. The naval transports, working  according to plans in connection with those of the army, have moved  their quotas of men and materials with the most punctual exactitude. The  naval reserve of fully trained officers and men is practically  inexhaustible. The faithful work of our shipbuilding concerns, carried  on uninterruptedly day and night under plans carefully prepared in time  of peace, has wrought for our navy a strong increase in powerful  warships.    As is known, the German fleet is built on the so-called  \"assumption-of-risk\" plan. That is, it is intended that it shall be so  strong that even the strongest sea power, in a conflict with the  Germans, risks forfeiting its former role as a world factor. This \"risk\"  idea has been hammered into the heart of every German seaman, and they  are all eager to win for the fleet such glory that it can be favorably  contrasted with the deeds of the old and the new armies.    Contrary to general expectation, the German fleet has taken the  offensive, and the first loss of the war was on the English side and in  English waters, the English cruiser Amphion running on to German mines  in the mouth of the Thames. In the Baltic and the Mediterranean also  German ships have taken the offensive against the enemies' coast, as is  shown by the bombardment by the Germans of the war harbor of Libau and  of fortified landing places on the Algerian coast.    Thus the fleet, confiding in the \"risk\" idea now proved to be true, and  in its earnest and courageous spirit, may look forward with confidence  to coming events.    But will not civilians have to hunger and thirst in these days? That is  an earnest question. The answer is, No. Even in Berlin, city of  millions, the milk supply did not fail for a day. Infants will not have  to bear the privations of war. All provisions are to be had at  reasonable prices. Empire, municipalities and merchants are working  successfully together to insure that there shall be a sufficient food  supply at not too great a cost. Not only is our great army mobilized,  but the whole folk is mobilized, and the distribution of labor, the food  question and the care of the sick and wounded are all being provided  for. The whole German folk has become a gigantic war camp, all are  mobilized to protect Kaiser, Folk and Fatherland, as the closing report  of the Reichstag put it. And all Germany pays the tribute of a salute to  the chiefs of the army and navy, who work with deeds, not words.             *       *       *       *       *          ARMY AND NAVY.
