Since the completion of the Second Edition of this work, two very  important Orders in Council, (dated April 15th, 1854,) have been  published. Before proceeding to explain the intended effect of these  Orders, it will be well to state that the consent of _both_ the Allies  of England in this war is necessary to give full validity to the  Orders.    It is a very old principle that, during a _conjoint_ War, no subject  of an ally can trade with the common enemy without liability to  forfeiture, in the prize courts of the ally, of all his property  engaged in such trade. This rule can be relaxed only by the permission  of the allied nations, according to their mutual consent.[212]    Lord Stowell lays down the principle in much broader terms, thus--         \"It has happened, since the world has grown more commercial,       that a practice has crept in of admitting particular       relaxations; and if _one_ state only is at war, no injury is       committed to any other state. It is of no importance to       other nations how much a _single_ belligerent chooses to       weaken and dilute his _own_ rights; but it is otherwise when       allied nations are pursuing a common cause against a common       enemy. Between them it must be taken as an implied, if not       an express contract, that one state shall not do anything to       defeat the general object. If one state admits its subjects       to carry on an uninterrupted trade with the enemy, the       consequence may be that it will supply aid and _comfort_ to       the enemy; especially if it is an enemy very materially       depending on the resources of foreign commerce, which may be       injurious to the prosecution of the common cause, _and the       interests of its ally_. It should seem that it is not       enough, therefore, to say that one state has allowed this       practice to its own subjects; it should appear to be at       least desirable, that it could be shown that the practice is       of such a nature that it can in no way interfere with the       common operations, or that it has the allowance of the       confederate state.\"[213]    Trade with the enemy has always been held to be a direct interference  with the common operations of the war, and indirect trade has been  regarded with as much jealousy as direct trade. If Lord Stowell is to  be trusted, this country cannot in any way waive its belligerent  rights, without the consent of its ally; so that it is quite in the  option of France at any time to withdraw its assent, or to modify it  in terms, and thus bind English merchants to the terms of their  assent.    The _intended_ effect of these Orders is well described in the  _Times_, of April 21st, 1854.         \"The Order in Council of the 15th April, 1854, recites, in       the first instance, Her Majesty's declaration made on the       opening of the war; but it then goes on to enact not only       that enemies' property laden on board neutral vessels shall       not be seized, but that all neutral and friendly ships shall       be permitted to import into Her Majesty's dominions, all       goods and merchandizes whatsoever, and to export everything       in like manner, except to blockaded ports, and except those       articles which require a special permission as being       contraband of war. But this liberty of trade is not confined       to neutrals. It is further ordered, that, with the above       exceptions only, British subjects shall have free leave to.       trade 'with all ports and places wherever situate,' save       only that British ships are not permitted to enter the ports       of the enemy. The effect of this Order is, therefore, to       leave the trade of this country with neutrals, and even the       indirect trade with Russia, in the same state it was in       during peace, as far as the law of our courts maritime is       concerned; and the doctrine of illegal trading with the       enemy is at an end.[214] The restrictions henceforth to be       imposed are solely those arising out of direct naval and       military operations, such as blockade, and those which the       enemy may think fit to lay upon British and French property.       As far as we are concerned, except that British ships are       not to enter Russian ports--which it is obvious that they       could not do without incurring the risk of a forfeiture of       their property and the imprisonment of their crews--the       trade may be lawfully carried on in any manner which the       ingenuity and enterprise of our merchants can devise. In       order to facilitate the removal of British property from the       ports of the Baltic and the White Sea, which were frozen up       at the date of the Order of the 29th of March, further leave       has been given to Russian vessels to come out of those       ports, if not under blockade, until the 15th of May; as, in   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#20)"],[1,"s. \"They said they  would call again about five.\"    \"Then,\" replied Thorndyke, \"as it is now a quarter to five, there is  just time for us to have a wash while you get the tea ready. The  particles that float in the atmosphere of Limehouse are not all  mother-of-pearl.\"    Our visitors arrived punctually, the third gentleman being, as we had  supposed, Mr. Solomon Loewe. Inspector Badger I had not seen before, and  he now impressed me as showing a tendency to invert the significance of  his own name by endeavouring to \"draw\" Thorndyke; in which, however, he  was not brilliantly successful.    \"I hope you are not going to disappoint Mr. Loewe, sir,\" he commenced  facetiously. \"You have had a good look at that hat--we saw your marks on  it--and he expects that you will be able to point us out the man, name  and address all complete.\" He grinned patronizingly at our unfortunate  client, who was looking even more haggard and worn than he had been on  the previous morning.    \"Have you--have you made any--discovery?\" Mr Loewe asked with pathetic  eagerness.    \"We examined the hat very carefully, and I think we have established a  few facts of some interest.\"    \"Did your examination of the hat furnish any information as to the  nature of the stolen property, sir?\" inquired the humorous inspector.    Thorndyke turned to the officer with a face as expressionless as a  wooden mask.    \"We thought it possible,\" said he, \"that it might consist of works of  Japanese art, such as netsukes, paintings, and such like.\"    Mr. Loewe uttered an exclamation of delighted astonishment, and the  facetiousness faded rather suddenly from the inspector's countenance.    \"I don't know how you can have found out,\" said he. \"We have only known  it half an hour ourselves, and the wire came direct from Florence to  Scotland Yard.\"    \"Perhaps you can describe the thief to us,\" said Mr. Loewe, in the same  eager tone.    \"I dare say the inspector can do that,\" replied Thorndyke.    \"Yes, I think so,\" replied the officer. \"He is a short strong man, with  a dark complexion and hair turning grey. He has a very round head, and  he is probably a workman engaged at some whiting or cement works. That  is all we know; if you can tell us any more, sir, we shall be very glad  to hear it.\"    \"I can only offer a few suggestions,\" said Thorndyke, \"but perhaps you  may find them useful. For instance, at 13, Birket Street, Limehouse,  there is living a Japanese gentleman named Futashima, who works at  Badcomb and Martin's mother-of-pearl factory. I think that if you were  to call on him, and let him try on the hat that you have, it would  probably fit him.\"    The inspector scribbled ravenously in his notebook, and Mr.  Marchmont--an old admirer of Thorndyke's--leaned back in his chair,  chuckling softly and rubbing his hands.    \"Then,\" continued my colleague, \"there is in Rankin Street, Limehouse, a  cab-yard, where another Japanese gentleman named Itu is employed. You  might find out where Itu was the night before last; and if you should  chance to see a hansom cab there--number 22,481--have a good look at it.  In the frame of the number-plate you will find six small holes. Those  holes may have held brads, and the brads may have held a false number  card. At any rate, you might ascertain where that cab was at 11.30 the  night before last. That is all I have to suggest.\"    Mr. Loewe leaped from his chair. \"Let us go--now--at once--there is no  time to be lost. A thousand thanks to you, doctor--a thousand million  thanks. Come!\"    He seized the inspector by the arm and forcibly dragged him towards the  door, and a few moments later we heard the footsteps of our visitors  clattering down the stairs.    \"It was not worth while to enter into explanations with them,\" said  Thorndyke, as the footsteps died away--\"nor perhaps with you?\"    \"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"I am waiting to be fully enlightened.\"    \"Well, then, my inferences in this case were perfectly simple ones,  drawn from well-known anthropological facts. The human race, as you  know, is roughly divided into three groups--the black, the white, and  the yellow races. But apart from the variable quality of colour, these  races have certain fixed characteristics associated especially with the  shape of the skull, of the eye-sockets, and the hair.    \"Thus in the black races the skull is long and narrow, the eye-sockets  are long and narrow, and the hair is flat and ribbon-like, and usually  coiled up like a watch-spring. In the white races the skull is oval, the  eye-sockets are oval, and the hair is slightly flattened or oval in  section, and tends to be wavy; while in the yellow or Mongol races, the  skull is short and round, the eye-sockets are short and round, and the  hair is straight and circular in section. So that we have, in the black  races, long skull, long orbits, flat hair; in the white races, oval  skull, oval orbits, oval hair; and in the yellow races, round skull,  round orbits, round hair.    \"Now, in this case we had to deal with a very short round skull. But you  cannot argue from races to individuals; there are many short-skulled  Englishmen. But when I found, associated with that skull, hairs which  were circular in section, it became practically certain that the  individual was a Mongol of some kind. The mother-of-pearl dust and the  granules of rice starch from the inside of the hat favoured this view,  for the pearl-shell industry is specially connected with China and  Japan, while starch granules from the hat of an Englishman would  probably be wheat starch.    \"Then as to the hair: it was, as I mentioned to you, circular in  section, and of very large diameter. Now, I have examined many thousands  of hairs, and the thickest that I have ever seen came from the heads of  Japanese; but the hairs from this hat were as thick as any of them. But  the hypothesis that the burglar was a Japanese received confirmation in  various ways. Thus, he was short, though strong and active, and the  Japanese are the shortest of the Mongol races, and very strong and  active.    \"Then his remarkable skill in handling the powerful caretaker--a retired  police-sergeant--suggested the Japanese art of ju-jitsu, while the  nature of the robbery was consistent with the value set by the Japanese  on works of art. Finally, the fact that only a particular collection was  taken, suggested a special, and probably national, character in the  things stolen, while their portability--you will remember that goods of  the value of from eight to twelve thousand pounds were taken away in two  hand-packages--was much more consistent with Japanese than Chinese  works, of which the latter tend rather to be bulky and ponderous. Still,  it was nothing but a bare hypothesis until we had seen Futashima--and,  indeed, is no more now. I may, after all, be entirely mistaken.\"    He was not, however; and at this moment there reposes in my drawing-room  an ancient netsuke, which came as a thank-offering from Mr. Isaac Loewe  on the recovery of the booty from a back room in No. 13, Birket Street,  Limehouse. The treasure, of course, was given in the first place to  Thorndyke, but transferred by him to my wife on the pretence that but  for my suggestion of shell-dust the robber would never have been traced.  Which is, on the face of it, preposterous.          IV    THE BLUE SEQUIN      Thorndyke stood looking up and down the platform with anxiety that  increased as the time drew near for the departure of the train.    \"This is very unfortunate,\" he said, reluctantly stepping into an empty  smoking compartment as the guard executed a flourish with his green  flag. \"I am afraid we have missed our friend.\" He closed the door, and,  as the train began to move, thrust his head out of the window.    \"Now I wonder if that will be he,\" he continued. \"If so, he has caught  the train by the skin of his teeth, and is now in one of the rear  compartments.\"    The subject of Thorndyke's speculations was Mr. Edward Stopford, of the  firm of Stopford and Myers, of Portugal Street, solicitors, and his  connection with us at present arose out of a telegram that had reached  our chambers on the preceding evening. It was reply-paid, and ran thus:         \"Can you come here to-morrow to direct defence? Important case. All       costs undertaken by us.--STOPFORD AND MYERS.\"    Thorndyke's reply had been in the affirmative, and early on this present  morning a further telegram--evidently posted overnight--had been  delivered:         \"Shall leave for Woldhurst by 8.25 from Charing Cross. Will call       for you if possible.--EDWARD STOPFORD.\"    He had not called, however, and, since he was unknown personally to us  both, we could not judge whether or not he had been among the passengers  on the platform.    \"It is most unfortunate,\" Thorndyke repeated, \"for it deprives us of  that preliminary consideration of the case which is so invaluable.\" He  filled his pipe thoughtfully, and, having made a fruitless inspection of  the platform at London Bridge, took up the paper that he had bought at  the bookstall, and began to turn over the leaves, running his eye  quickly down the columns, unmindful of the journalistic baits in  paragraph or article.    \"It is a great disadvantage,\" he observed, while still glancing through  the paper, \"to come plump into an inquiry without preparation--to be  confronted with the details before one has a chance of considering the  case in general terms. For instance--\"    He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, and as I looked up  inquiringly I saw that he had turned over another page, and was now  reading attentively.    \"This looks like our case, Jervis,\" he said presently, handing me the  paper and indicating a paragraph at the top of the page. It was quite  brief, and was headed \"Terrible Murder in Kent,\" the account being as  follows:    \"A shocking crime was discovered yesterday morning at the"]]]
