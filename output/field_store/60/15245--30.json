This extraordinarily rapid success is very  striking, and seems to afford proof that there is a widely felt want for  an international language. Three Volapük congresses were held, of which  the third, held in Paris in 1889, with proceedings entirely in Volapük,  was the most important.    The rapid decline of Volapük is even more instructive than its  sensational rise. The congress of Paris marked its zenith: hopes ran  high, and success seemed assured. Within two years it was practically  dead. No more congresses were held, the partisans dwindled away, the  local clubs dissolved, the newspapers failed, and the whole movement  came to an end. There only remained a new academy founded by Bishop  Schleyer, and here and there a group of the faithful.[1]       [1]A Volapük journal still appears in Graz, Stiria--_Volapükabled     lezenodik_. The editor has just (March 1907) retired, and the veteran     Bishop Schleyer, now seventy-five years old, is taking up the     editorship again.    The chief reason of this failure was internal dissension. First arose  the question of principle: Should Volapük aim at being a literary  language, capable of expressing all the finer shades of thought and  feeling? or should it confine itself to being a practical means of  business communication?    Bishop Schleyer claimed for his invention an equal rank among the  literary languages of the world. The practical party, headed by M.  Kerckhoffs, wished to keep it utilitarian and practical. With the  object of increasing its utility, they proposed certain changes in the  language; and thus there arose, in the second place, differences of  opinion as to fundamental points of structure, such as the nature and  origin of the roots to be adopted. Vital questions were thus reopened,  and the whole language was thrown back into the melting-pot.    The first congress was held at Friedrichshafen in August 1884, and was  attended almost exclusively by Germans. The second congress, Munich,  August 1887, brought together over 200 Volapükists from different  countries. A professor of geology from Halle University was elected  president, and an International Academy of Volapük was founded.    Then the trouble began. M. Kerckhoffs was unanimously elected director  of the academy, and Bishop Schleyer was made grand-master (_cifal_)  for life. Questions arose as to the duties of the academy and the  respective powers of the inventor of the language and the academicians.  M. Kerckhoffs was all along the guiding spirit on the side of the  academy. He was in the main supported by the Volapük world, though there  seems to have been some tendency, at any rate at first, on the part of  the Germans to back the bishop. It is impossible to go into details of  the points at issue. Suffice it to say, that eventually the director  of the academy carried a resolution giving the inventor three votes to  every one of ordinary members in all academy divisions, but refusing him  the right of veto, which he claimed. The bishop replied by a threat to  depose M. Kerckhoffs from the directorship, which of course he could not  make good. The constitution of the academy was only binding inasmuch as  it had been drawn up and adopted by the constituent members, and it gave  no such powers to the inventor.    So here was a very pretty quarrel as to the ownership of Volapük.  The bishop said it belonged to him, as he had invented it: he was  its father. The academy said it belonged to the public, who had a  right to amend it in the common interest. This child, which had newly  opened its eyes and smiled upon the world, and upon which the world  was then smiling back--was it a son domiciled in its father's house  and fully _in patria potestate_? or a ward in the guardianship of its  chief promoters? or an orphan foundling, to be boarded out on the  scattered-home system at the public expense, and to be brought up to be  useful to the community at large? A vexed question of paternity; and the  worst of it was, there was no international court competent to try the  case.    Meantime the congress of 1889 at Paris came on. Volapük was booming  everywhere. Left to itself, it flourished like a green bay-tree. This  meeting was to set an official seal upon its success; and governments,  convinced by this thing done openly in the _ville lumière_, would accept  the _fait accompli_ and introduce it into their schools.    Thirteen countries sent representatives, including Turkey and China.  The great Kerckhoffs was elected president. The proceedings were in  Volapük. The foundling's future was canvassed in terms of himself by  a cosmopolitan board of guardians, who did not yet know what he was.  Rather a Gilbertian situation. Trying a higher flight, we may say, in  Platonic phrase, that Volapük seemed to be about midway between being  and not-being. It is a far cry from Gilbert _viâ_ Plato to Mr. Kipling,  but perhaps Volapük, at this juncture, may be most aptly described as  a \"sort of a giddy harumphrodite,\" if not \"a devil an' a ostrich an' a  orphan-child in one.\"    Business done: The congress discusses.    The congress passed a resolution that there should be drawn up \"a simple  normal grammar, from which all useless rules should be excluded,\" and  proceeded to adopt a final constitution for the Volapük Academy.    Article 15 says: \"The decisions of the academy must be at once submitted  to the inventor. If the inventor has not within thirty days protested  against the decisions, they are valid. Decisions not approved by the  inventor are referred back to the academy, and are valid if carried by a  two-thirds majority.\"    The bishop held out for his right of absolute veto, as his episcopal  fellows and their colleagues are doing \"in another place\" in England.  The conflict presents some analogy with other graver constitutional  matters, involving discussion of the respective merits of absolute and  suspensive veto, and may therefore have some interest at present, apart  from its great importance in any scheme for an international language.    The upshot was that dissensions broke out within the academy. The  director, unable to carry a complete scheme of reformed grammar,  resigned (1891), and the academy, whose business it was to arrange the  next congress and keep the movement going, never convened a fourth  congress. Several academicians set to work on new artificial languages  of their own; and what was left of the Academy of Volapük, under a new  director, M. Rosenberger, a St. Petersburg railway engineer, elected  1893, subsequently turned its attention to working out a new language,  to which was given the name Idiom Neutral (see next chapter).           *       *       *       *       *    It is interesting to note that, when Volapük was nearing its high-water  mark, the American Philosophical Society appointed a committee (October  1887) to inquire into its scientific value.    This committee reported in November 1887. The report states that the  creation of an international language is in conformity with the general  tendency of modern civilization, and is not merely desirable, but  _will certainly be realized._ It goes on to reject Volapük as the  solution of the problem, as being on the whole retrogade in tendency.  It is too arbitrary in construction, and not international enough in  vocabulary; nor does it correspond to the general trend of development  of language, which is away from a synthetic grammar (inflection by means  of terminations, as in Latin and Greek) and towards an analytic one  (inflection by termination replaced by prepositions and auxiliaries).    But the committee was so fully convinced of the importance of an  international language, that it proposed to the Philosophical Society  that it should invite all the learned societies of the world to  co-operate in the production of a universal language. A resolution  embodying this recommendation was adopted by the society, and the  invitations were sent out. About twenty societies accepted--among them  the University of Edinburgh. The Scots again!    The London Philological Society commissioned Mr. Ellis to investigate  the subject, and upon his report declined to co-operate. Mr. Ellis was  a believer in Volapük, and furthermore did not agree with the American  Philosophical Society's conclusion that an international language ought  to be founded on an Indo-Germanic (Aryan) basis. In this Mr. Ellis was  almost certainly wrong, as subsequent experience is tending to show. The  Japanese, among others, are taking up Esperanto with enthusiasm, find  it easy, and make no difficulty about its Aryan basis. But, apart from  linguistic considerations, Mr. Ellis's practical reasoning was certainly  sound. It was to this effect: The main thing is to adopt a language  that is already in wide use and shown to be adequate. Alterations bring  dissension; by sticking to what we have already got, imperfections and  all, strife is avoided, and the thing is at once reduced to practice.    This was a wise counsel, and applies to-day with double force to the  present holder of the field, Esperanto, which is besides, in the opinion  of experts, a better language than Volapük, and far easier to acquire.    However, on the question of technical merits, the American Philosophical  Society was probably right, as against the London Philological Society  represented by Mr. Ellis. And the proof is that Volapük died--primarily,  indeed, of dissensions among its partisans, but of dissensions  superinduced on inherent defects of principle. That this is true may  be seen from the subsequent history of the Volapük movement. This is  briefly narrated in the next chapter, under the name of Idiom Neutral.                                         V                            HISTORY OF IDIOM NEUTRAL    We saw above that M. Kerckhoffs was succeeded in the directorship of the  Volapük Academy, 1893,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#20)"],[1,"make him respected; talent is wealth, tact is ready money. For  all the practical purposes, tact carries it against talent ten to one.    Take them to the theater, and put them against each other on the stage,  and talent shall produce you a tragedy that shall scarcely live long  enough to be condemned, while tact keeps the house in a roar, night after  night, with its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent,  there is no want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together: so we  have successful pieces which are not respectable, and respectable pieces  which are not successful.    Take them to the bar, and let them shake their learned curls at each other  in legal rivalry; talent sees its way clearly, but tact is first at its  journey's end. Talent has many a compliment from the bench, but tact  touches fees. Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster,  tact arouses astonishment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is, that  it has no weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it hits the right nail  on the head; it loses no time; it takes all hints; and, by keeping its eye  on the weathercock, is ready to take advantage of every wind that blows.    Take them into the church: talent has always something worth hearing, tact  is sure of abundance of hearers; talent may obtain a living, tact will  make one; talent gets a good name, tact a great one; talent convinces,  tact converts; talent is an honor to the profession, tact gains honor from  the profession.    Take them to court: talent feels its weight, tact finds its way; talent  commands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored with approbation, and tact is  blessed by preferment. Place them in the senate: talent has the ear of the  house, but tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for  employment, but tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping into  place with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a billiard ball  insinuates itself into the pocket.    It seems to know everything, without learning anything. It has served an  extemporary apprenticeship; it wants no drilling; it never ranks in the  awkward squad; it has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind side. It puts on  no look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profundity, but plays with  the details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand flourishes over  the keys of the pianoforte. It has all the air of commonplace, and all the  force and power of genius.        XIX. SPEECH BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION. (115)    Patrick Henry, 1730-1799, was born in Hanover County, Virginia, He  received instruction in Latin and mathematics from his father, but seemed  to develop a greater fondness for hunting, fishing, and playing the fiddle  than for study. Twice he was set up in business, and twice failed before  he was twenty-four. He was then admitted to the bar after six weeks' study  of the law. He got no business at first in his profession, but lived with  his father-in-law. His wonderful powers of oratory first showed themselves  in a celebrated case which he argued in Hanover Courthouse, his own father  being the presiding magistrate. He began very awkwardly, but soon rose to  a surprising height of eloquence, won his case against great odds, and was  carried off in triumph by the delighted spectators. His fame was now  established; business flowed in, and he was soon elected to the Virginia  Legislature. He was a delegate to the Congress of 1774, and in 1775 made  the prophetic speech of which the following selection is a portion.  It  was his own motion that the \"colony be immediately put in a state of  defense.\" During the Revolution he was, for several years, Governor of  Virginia. In 1788 he earnestly opposed the adoption of the Federal  Constitution. When he died, he left a large family and an ample fortune.  In person, Mr. Henry was tall and rather awkward, with a face stern and  grave. When he spoke on great occasions, his awkwardness forsook him, his  face lighted up, and his eyes flashed with a wonderful fire. In his life,  he was good-humored, honest, and temperate. His patriotism was of the  noblest type; and few men in those stormy times did better service for  their country than he.  ###      It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to  shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that  siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men,  engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be  of the number of those, who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear  not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my  part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the  whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.    I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of  experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past;  and, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the  conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those  hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the  house? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately  received? Trust it not: it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not  yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves, how this gracious  reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which  cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a  work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to  be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us  not deceive ourselves. These are the implements of war and subjugation,--  the last arguments to which kings resort.    I ask, gentlemen, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to  force us into submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive  for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call  for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, she has none. They are  meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind  and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so  long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?  We have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to  offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every  light in which it was capable; but it has been all in vain.    Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we  find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,  deceive ourselves longer. We have done everything that could be done, to  avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have  remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves at the  foot of the throne, and implored its interposition to arrest the  tyrannical bands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been  slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult;  our supplications disregarded; and we have been spurned with contempt from  the foot of the throne.    In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and  reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be  free; if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for  which we have been so long contending; if we mean not basely to abandon  the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we  have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our  contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, we must fight! An  appeal to arms and the God of Hosts, is all that is left us.    They tell us that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an  adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the  next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British  guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by  irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual  resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive  phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? We  are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of  nature hath placed in our power.    Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such  a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our  enemy can send against us. Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone.  There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who  will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle is not to  the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides,  we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too  late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and  slavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains  of Boston! The war is inevitable; and; let it come! I repeat it, let it  come!    It is in vain to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace, peace; but  there is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps  from the north, will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our  brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that  gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,  as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty  God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me  liberty, or give me death.
