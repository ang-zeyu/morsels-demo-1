I've heard a  lot and seen some things.\"    \"Did you hear how I mussed up Fanchon Smith's party?\"    \"You bet I did. That's one reason I want to see some of this dancing.  Will you go?\"    \"Yes, I can stand it if you can.\"    \"All right, Buddy, I'll meet you at the inn--eight o'clock.\"    Lane slowly made his way to a secluded corner of the lobby, where he  sat down. Red Payson dead! Lane felt that he should not have been  surprised or shocked. But he was both. The strange, cold sensation  gradually wore away and with it the slight trembling of his limbs. A  mournful procession of thoughts and images returned to his mind and he  sat and brooded.    At the hour of his appointment with his friend, Lane went to the front  of the lobby. Blair was on time. He hobbled in, erect and martial of  bearing despite the crutch, and his dark citizen's suit emphasized the  whiteness of his face. Being home had softened Blair a little. Yet the  pride and tragic bitterness were there. But when Blair espied Lane a  warmth burned out of the havoc in his face. Lane's conscience gave him  a twinge. It dawned upon him that neither his spells of illness, nor  his distress over his sister Lorna, nor his obsession to see and  understand what the young people were doing could hold him wholly  excusable for having neglected his comrade.    Their hand-clasp was close, almost fierce, and neither spoke at once.  But they looked intently into each other's faces. Emotion stormed  Lane's heart. He realized that Blair loved him and that he loved  Blair--and that between them was a measureless bond, a something only  separation could make tangible. But little of what they felt came out  in their greetings.    \"Dare, why the devil don't you can that uniform,\" demanded Blair,  cheerfully. \"People might recognize you've been 'over there.'\"    \"Well, Blair, I expected you'd have a cork leg by this time,\" said  Lane.    \"Nothing doing,\" returned the other. \"I want to be perpetually  reminded that I was in the war. This 'forget the war' propaganda we  see and hear all over acts kind of queer on a soldier.... Let's find a  bench away from these people.\"    After they were comfortably seated Blair went on: \"Do you know, Dare,  I don't miss my leg so much when I'm crutching around. But when I try  to sit down or get up! By heck, sometimes I forget it's gone. And  sometimes I want to scratch my lost foot. Isn't that hell?\"    \"I'll say so, Buddy,\" returned Lane, with a laugh.    \"Read this,\" said Blair, taking a paper from his pocket, and  indicating a column.    Whereupon Lane read a brief Associated Press dispatch from Washington,  D.C., stating that one Payson, disabled soldier of twenty-five,  suffering with tuberculosis caused by gassed lungs, had come to  Washington to make in person a protest and appeal that had been  unanswered in letters. He wanted money from the government to enable  him to travel west to a dry climate, where doctors assured him he  might get well. He made his statement to several clerks and officials,  and waited all day in the vestibule of the department. Suddenly he was  seized with a hemorrhage, and, falling on the floor, died before aid  could be summoned.    Without a word Lane handed the paper back to his friend.    \"Red was a queer duck,\" said Blair, rather hoarsely. \"You remember  when I 'phoned you last over two weeks ago?... Well, just after that  Red got bad on my hands. He wouldn't accept charity, he said. And he  wanted to beat it. He got wise to my mother. He wouldn't give up  trying to get money from the government--back money owed him, he  swore--and the idea of being turned down at home seemed to obsess him.  I talked and cussed myself weak. No good! Red beat it soon after  that--beat it from Middleville on a freight train. And I never heard a  word from him.... Not a word....\"    \"Blair, can't you see it Red's way?\" queried Lane, sadly.    \"Yes, I can,\" responded Blair, \"but hell! he might have gotten well.  Doc Bronson said Red had a chance. I could have borrowed enough money  to get him out west. Red wouldn't take it.\"    \"And he ran off--exposed himself to cold and starvation--over-exertion  and anger,\" added Lane.    \"Exactly. Brought on that hemorrhage and croaked. All for nothing!\"    \"No, Blair. All for a principle,\" observed Lane. \"Red was fired out of  the hospital without a dollar. There was something terribly wrong.\"    \"Wrong?... God Almighty!\" burst out Blair, with hard passion. \"Let me  read you something in this same paper.\" With shaking hands he unfolded  it, searched until he found what he wanted, and began to read:    \"'If the _actual_ needs of disabled veterans require the expenditure  of much money, then unquestionably a majority of the taxpayers of the  country will favor spending it. Despite the insistent demand for  economy in Washington that is arising from every part of the country,  no member of House or Senate will have occasion to fear that he is  running counter to popular opinion when eventually he votes to take  generous care of disabled soldiers.'\"    Blair's trembling voice ceased, and then twisting the newspaper into a  rope, he turned to Lane. \"Dare, can you understand that?... Red Payson  was a bull-headed boy, not over bright. But you and I have some  intelligence, I hope. We can allow for the immense confusion at  Washington--the senselessness of red tape--the callosity of  politicians. But when we remember the eloquent calls to us boys--the  wonderfully worded appeals to our patriotism, love of country and  home--the painted posters bearing the picture of a beautiful American  girl--or a young mother with a baby--remembering these deep,  passionate calls to the best in us, can you understand _that_ sort of  talk now?\"    \"Blair, I think I can,\" replied Lane. \"Then--before and after the  draft--the whole country was at a white heat of all that the approach  of war rouses. Fear, self-preservation, love of country, hate of the  Huns, inspired patriotism, and in most everybody the will to fight and  to sacrifice.... The war was a long, hideous, soul-racking,  nerve-destroying time. When it ended, and the wild period of joy and  relief had its run, then all that pertained to the war sickened and  wearied and disgusted the majority of people. It's 'forget the war.'  You and Payson and I got home a year too late.\"    \"Then--it's just--monstrous,\" said Blair, heavily.    \"That's all, Blair. Just monstrous. But we can't beat our spirits out  against this wall. No one can understand us--how alone we are. Let's  forget _that_--this wall--this thing called government. Shall we spend  what time we have to live always in a thunderous atmosphere of  mind--hating, pondering, bitter?\"    \"No. I'll make a compact with you,\" returned Blair, with flashing  eyes. \"Never to speak again of _that_--so long as we live!\"    \"Never to a living soul,\" rejoined Lane, with a ring in his voice.    They shook hands much the same as when they had met half an hour  earlier.    \"So!\" exclaimed Blair, with a deep breath. \"And now, Dare, tell me how  you made out with Helen. You cut me short over the 'phone.\"    \"Blair, that day coming into New York on the ship, you didn't put it  half strong enough,\" replied Lane. Then he told Blair about the call  he had made upon Helen, and what had transpired at her studio.    Blair did not voice the scorn that his eyes expressed. And, in fact,  most of his talking was confined to asking questions. Lane found it  easy enough to unburden himself, though he did not mention his calls  on Mel Iden, or Colonel Pepper's disclosures.    \"Well, I guess it's high time we were meandering up to the hall,\" said  Blair, consulting his watch. \"I'm curious about this Prom. Think we're  in for a jolt. It's four years since I went to a Prom. Now, both of  us, Dare, have a sister who'll be there, besides all our old  friends.... And we're not dancing! But I want to look on. They've got  an out-of-town orchestra coming--a jazz orchestra. There'll probably  be a hot time in the old town to-night.\"    \"Lorna did not tell me,\" replied Lane, as they got up to go. \"But I  suppose she'd rather I didn't know. We've clashed a good deal lately.\"    \"Dare, I hear lots of talk,\" said Blair. \"Margaret is chummy with me,  and some of her friends are always out at the house. I hear Dick Swann  is rushing Lorna. Think he's doing it on the q-t.\"    \"I know he is, Blair, but I can't catch them together,\" returned Lane.  \"Lorna is working now. Swann got her the job.\"    \"Looks bad to me,\" replied Blair, soberly. \"Swann is cutting a swath.  I hear his old man is sore on him.... I'd take Lorna out of that  office quick.\"    \"Maybe you would,\" declared Lane, grimly. \"For all the influence or  power I have over Lorna I might as well not exist.\"    They walked silently along the street for a little while. Lane had to  accommodate his step to the slower movement of his crippled friend.  Blair's crutch tapped over the stone pavement and clicked over the  curbs. They crossed the railroad tracks and turned off the main street  to go down a couple of blocks.    \"Shades of the past!\" exclaimed Blair, as they reached a big brick  building, well-lighted in front by a sizzling electric lamp. The night  was rather warm and clouds of insects were wheeling round the light.  \"The moths and the flame!\" added Blair, satirically. \"Well, Dare, old  bunkie, brace up and we'll go over the top. This ought to be fun for  us.\"    \"I don't see it,\" replied Lane. \"I'll be about as welcome as a bull in  a china shop.\"    \"Oh, I didn't mean any one would throw fits over us,\" responded Blair.  \"But we ought to get some fun out of the fact.\"    \"What fact?\" queried Lane, puzzled.    \"Rather far-fetched, maybe. But I'll get a kick out of looking  on--watching these swell slackers with the girls _we_ fought for.\"    \"Wonder why they didn't give the dance at the armory, where they'd not  have to climb stairs, and have more room?\""]]]
