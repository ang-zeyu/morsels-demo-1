They searched his apparel,  and took from him his gold, amber, watch and a pocket compass. He had  fortunately in the night buried another compass in the sand, and  this, with the clothes he had on, was all that was now left him by  this rapacious and inhospitable savage.    The pocket compass soon became an object of superstitious curiosity,  and Ali desired Mr. Park to inform him, why the small piece of iron  always pointed to the Great Desert? Mr. Park was somewhat puzzled: to  have pleaded ignorance, would have made Ali suspect he wished to  conceal the truth; he therefore replied, that his mother resided far  beyond the land of Sehara, and whilst she lived, the piece of iron  would always point that way, and serve as a guide to conduct him to  her, and that if she died, it would point to her grave. Ali now  looked at the compass with redoubled wonder, and turned it round and  round repeatedly, but finding it always pointed the same way, he  returned it to Mr. Park, declaring he thought there was magic in it,  and he was afraid to keep so dangerous an instrument in his  possession.    On the morning of the 20th, a council was hold in Ali's tent  respecting Mr. Park, and its decision was differently related to him  by different persons, but the most probable account he received from  Ali's son, a boy, who told him it was determined to put out his eyes,  by the special advice of the priests, but the sentence was deferred  until Fatima, the queen, then absent, had seen the white man. Mr.  Park, anxious to know his destiny, went to the king and begged  permission to return to Jarra. This was, however, flatly refused, as  the queen had not yet seen him, and he must stay until she arrived,  after which his horse would be restored, and he should  be at liberty  to return to Ludamar. Mr. Park appeared pleased; and without any hope  of at present making his escape, on account of the excessive heat, he  resolved to wait patiently for the rainy season. Overcome with  melancholy, and having passed a restless night, in the morning he was  attacked by a fever. He had wrapped himself up in a cloak to promote  perspiration, and was asleep, when a party of Moors entered the hut,  and pulled away the cloak. He made signs that he was sick, and wished  to sleep, but his distress afforded sport to these savages. \"This  studied and degrading insolence,\" says Mr. Park, \"to which I was  constantly exposed, was one of the bitterest ingredients in the cup  of captivity, and often made life itself a burthen to me. In these  distressing moments I have frequently envied the situation of the  slave, who, amidst all his calamities, could still possess the  enjoyment of his own thoughts, a happiness to which I had for some  time, been a stranger. Wearied out with such continual insults, and  perhaps a little peevish from the fever, I trembled, lest my passion  might unawares overleap the bounds of prudence, and spur me to some  sudden act of resentment, when death must be the inevitable  consequence.\"    In this miserable situation he left the hut, and laid down amongst  some shady trees, a small distance from the camp, but Ali's son, with  a number of horsemen galloping to the place, ordered him to follow  them to the king. He begged them to allow him to remain where he was  for a few hours, when one of them presented a pistol towards him, and  snapped it twice; he cocked it a third time, and was striking the  flint with a piece of steel, when Mr. Park begged him to desist, and  returned with them to the camp. Ali appeared much out of humour, and  taking up a pistol fresh primed it, and turning towards Mr. Park with  a menacing look, said something to him in Arabic. Mr. Park desired  his boy to ask what offence he had committed, and was informed, that  having gone out of the camp without Ali's permission, it was  suspected he had some design to make his escape, but in future, if he  were seen without the skirts of the camp, orders were given that he  should be immediately shot.    About this time all the women of the camp had their feet, and the  ends of their fingers stained of a dark saffron colour, but whether  for religion or ornament, Mr. Park could not discover. On the evening  of the 26th, a party of these ladies visited him, _to ascertain by  actual inspection, whether the rites of circumcision extended to  Christians_. Mr. Park was not a little surprised at this unexpected  requisition, and to treat the business jocularly, he told them it was  not customary in his country, to give ocular demonstration before _so  many_ beautiful women, but if all would retire, one young lady  excepted, to whom he pointed, he would satisfy her curiosity. The  ladies enjoyed the joke, and went away laughing, The preferred  damsel, although she did not avail herself of the offer, to show she  was pleased with the _compliment_, sent him meal and milk.    On the morning of the 28th, Ali sent a slave to order Mr. Park to be  in readiness to ride out with him in the afternoon, as he intended to  show him to some of his women, and about four o'clock the king with  six attendants came riding to the hut. But here a new difficulty  occurred, the Moors objected to Mr. Park's _nankeen breeches_, which  they said were inelegant and indecent, as this was a visit to ladies,  but Ali ordered him to wrap his cloak around him. They visited four  different ladies, by each of whom Mr. Park was presented with a bowl  of milk and water. They were very inquisitive, and examined his hair  and skin with great attention, but affected to consider him as an  inferior being, and knit their brows, and appeared to shudder when  they looked at the whiteness of his skin. All the seladies were  remarkably corpulent, which the Moors esteem as the highest mark of  beauty. In the course of the excursion, the dress and appearance of  Mr. Park afforded infinite mirth to the company, who galloped round  him, exhibiting various feats of activity and horsemanship.    The Moors are very good horsemen, riding without fear, and their  saddles being high before and behind, afford them a very secure seat,  and should they fall, the country is so soft and sandy, that they are  seldom hurt. The king always rode upon a milk-white horse, with its  tail dyed red. He never walked, but to prayers, and two or three  horses were always kept ready saddled near his tent. The Moors set a  high value upon their horses, as their fleetness enables them to  plunder the negro countries.    On the same afternoon, a whirlwind passed through the camp, with such  violence, that it overturned three tents, and blew down one side of  the hut in which Mr. Park was. These whirlwinds come from the Great  Desert, and at that season of the year are so common, that Mr. Park  has seen five or six of them at one time. They carry up quantities of  sand to an amazing height, which resemble at a distance so many  moving pillars of smoke.    The scorching heat of the sun, upon a dry and sandy country, now made  the air insufferably hot. Ali having robbed Mr. Park of his  thermometer, he had no means of forming a comparative judgment; but  in the middle of the day, when the beams of the vertical sun are  seconded by the scorching wind from the desert, the ground is  frequently heated to such a degree, as not to be borne by the naked  foot; even the negro slaves will not run from one tent to another  without their sandals. At this time of the day, the Moors are  stretched at length in their tents, either asleep or unwilling to  move, and Mr. Park has often felt the wind so hot, that he could not  hold his hand in the current of air, which came through the crevices  of his hut, without feeling sensible pain.    During Mr. Park's stay, a child died in an adjoining tent. The mother  and relations immediately began the death howl, in which they were  joined by several female visitors. He had no opportunity of seeing  the burial, which is performed secretly during night, near the tent.  They plant a particular shrub over the grave, which no stranger is  allowed to pluck, nor even touch.    About the same time a moorish wedding was celebrated, the ceremony of  which is thus described by Mr. Park. \"In the evening the tabala or  large drum was beaten to announce a wedding, which was held at one of  the neighbouring tents. A great number of people of both sexes  assembled, but without that mirth and hilarity which take place at a  negro wedding; here there was neither singing nor dancing, nor any  other amusement that I could perceive. A woman was beating the drum,  and the other women joining at times like a chorus, by setting up a  shrill scream, and at the same time moving their tongues from one  side of the mouth to the other with great celerity. I was soon tired  and had returned to my hut where I was sitting almost asleep, when an  old woman entered with a wooden bowl in her hand, and signified that  she had brought me a present from the bride. Before I could recover  from the surprise which this message created, the woman discharged  the content of the bowl full in my face. Finding that it was the same  sort of _holy water_, with which, among the Hottentots, a priest is  said to sprinkle a new-married couple, I began to suspect that the  old lady was actuated by mischief or malice, but she gave me  seriously to understand, that it was a nuptial benediction from the  bride's own person, and which, on such occasions, is always received  by the young unmarried Moors as a mark of distinguished favour. This  being the ease, I wiped my face and sent my acknowledgments to the  lady. The wedding drum continued to beat, and the women to sing, or  rather to whistle during the whole of the night. About nine in the  morning, the bride was brought in state from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#20)"],[1,"of a particular kind, having long, black, and brushy  tails; with a few birds, which from the length of the tail feathers, they  denominated pheasants.    On the 25th they continued in their course, SSW for six miles, through a  country in general open, and apparently of a good black soil. In the  course of the day they saw many kangaroos and several emus; and fell in  with a party of natives, one of whom engaged to accompany them, on  condition of their halting for that night where they then were.  Consenting to this, they had leisure to examine a hill in that  neighbourhood, the face of which appeared white, and proved to be an  immense cliff of salt, a specimen of which they brought in.    On the 26th, they determined to incline more to the westward, and  travelled 16 miles in a direction WSW over a rocky country, covered with  brush wood, and a prickly kind of vine. They did not meet with any  natives; and that animals existed there, they only saw by their faeces.    They continued on the 27th travelling in the same direction about 16  miles; the first six of which were like those of the preceding day. From  thence they got into an open but mountainous country, where they crossed  a small river, and discovered a quantity of coal and limestone. Here  every mile they went the scene improved. The rocky and barren ground was  exchanged for a flat country and beautiful meadows, furnishing pasture  for the kangaroos and emus, several of which they saw. The timber was  observed to run small, and to be thinly scattered about, there being  scarcely ten trees upon an acre of ground. The quality of them was known  in the settlement, where a similar timber was called the Black Wattle.    On the 28th their course was still WSW and their distance increased 20  miles in that direction. The land and the timber on it were much the same  as they had seen the preceding day. In one part they ascended a hill,  from which they obtained a view of the country for some distance round.  To the northward it seemed to be open, and thinly clad with timber: to  the north-westward they saw some high mountains, and an appearance of  much good land in that direction: to the westward they observed a deep  break in the land; this they conjectured to be formed by a river, which,  if one, laid in a SE and NW direction. To the southward the land seemed  high, but still open. In the course of this day's journey they met with a  party of the natives, who appeared much terrified, and instantly ran away  from them. One of the party, however, pursued and came up with a woman  and child, whom he detained, from an opinion that the men might be  thereby induced to return; but, although she remained with them the whole  of the night, which she passed in tears and lamentations, not knowing  what fate might await her, the men did not appear. They, therefore, made  her a present of a small hatchet, and in the morning sent her back to her  friends. Wilson, understanding something of the language of these  mountain natives, hoped to have gained some information of the country  from this woman; but she could not comprehend him.    These natives were all clothed with garments of skins of different  animals, which reached from their shoulders down to their heels.    On the 29th, they again travelled 24 miles in the same direction. During  the first four miles the country was not good, the ground being rocky and  covered with low shrubs, and here and there intersected with creeks,  which appeared all to run toward some river, probably to that which from  the top of the hill they supposed to be one. At the head of those creeks  they saw several falls of water, one of which fell at the least 40 feet,  and two others not less than 20 feet each. They now walked to the  northward for 12 miles, thinking to get round the heads of the creeks;  but unfortunately they fell in with more. They then determined to keep  their former course of WSW, but found the country rocky and barren. Here  they observed a tree which they had not before noticed, about the size of  an apple-tree; the leaves of which were of a lighter blue than the powder  blue used in washing, and the bark resembling that of the mahogany tree.  They also passed the dung of an animal to appearance as large as that of  a horse.    The party were now much exhausted, having had nothing to eat for two  days, except one rat, about the size of a kitten. Wilson was able to go  forward; but his companions were very unwell, and began to wish  themselves back.    On the 30th, they continued for 16 miles in the same direction of WSW. In  the course of the day they fell in with the head of a river, very nearly  as large as the Hawkesbury, appearing to run from SE to NW. Its banks  were so rocky and steep that they would have found infinite difficulty in  descending them; to which they were strongly invited by the appearance of  a level open country on the other side; and Wilson proposed making a  canoe to cross over with; but both the others were so faint and tired,  having had nothing to eat, in addition to the rat, but two small birds  each, that they were afraid to venture. Their shoes being worn out, and  their feet cut and bruised by walking so long, they proposed returning.    This being agreed to, on the 1st of this month they steered back in a  direction SE by E in which having walked about nine miles, they fell in  with many spacious meadows thinly chequered with trees, extending for at  least some hundred acres. The hills which they met with were as slightly  covered with timber; and what there was, was light. The ground was of a  good quality, except on the tops of the hills, where it was stony. Here,  for want of food, they were much exhausted, and observed many birds which  they had not before seen, but could not approach near enough to shoot.    On the 2nd, their course was ENE through a delightful country, full of  capacious meadows, extending for some thousands of acres, with only a  single tree here and there. Some of these meadows were watered by ponds  of great length, but they did not perceive any wild fowl on them. From  thence, to the SW the country looked well. In the latter part of the day,  having passed the first ridge of mountains, they fell in with a vast  number of kangaroos, one of which they had the good fortune to kill, and  were much refreshed by it.    On the morning of the 3rd, they thought they heard the report of two guns  in the SE which they answered; but they were not returned. They were now  in that part of the country which Wilson was acquainted with; but it was  an unfruitful spot, and badly calculated for travellers in their  situation, producing nothing but a few roots and grub worms. They must  even here have perished, had it not been for the great exertions made by  Wilson, who kept up their spirits by assurances of being near Prospect  Hill; which place, after much toil and difficulty, they at length  reached, when despairing of living to see it.    This is the sum of the information given by these people. With respect to  the direction in which they travelled, that might not be very correct,  nor can much reliance be placed on their judgment of the distances which  they went in each day. Of the face of the country their account may be  more just. Of its inability to support the traveller, their appearance  was a most convincing argument: and this narrative of their journey has  been detailed so much at length, not only because these people had  penetrated farther than any European had ever been before; but to show  the labour, danger, and difficulties, which attended the exploring the  interior of this extensive country.    On arranging their courses and distances on paper, they appeared to have  travelled in a direction SW three-fourths W about 140 miles from  Parramatta. They brought in with them one of the birds which they had  named pheasants, but which on examination appeared to be a variety of the  Bird of Paradise.    The size of this curious and handsome bird was that of a common hen; the  colour a reddish black, the bill long, the legs black and very strong.  The tail, about two feet in length, was formed of several feathers, two  of which were the principal, having the interior sides scalloped  alternately of a deeper or lighter reddish brown inclining to orange,  shading gently into a white or silver colour next the stem, crossing each  other, and at the very extremity terminating in a broad black round  finishing. The difference of colour in the scallops did not proceed from  any precise change in the colour itself, but from the texture of the  feather, which was alternately thicker and thinner. The fibres of the  outer side of the stem were narrow and of a lead colour. Two other  feathers of equal length, and of a blueish or lead colour, lay within  those; very narrow, and having fibres only on one side of the stem. Many  other feathers of the same length lay within those again, which were of a  pale greyish colour, and of the most delicate texture, resembling more  the skeleton of a feather than a perfect one. The annexed engraving,  from the pencil of a capital artist, will give a better idea of this  beautiful bird than can be formed from any description.    A general muster took place on the 14th in every district of the colony,  at which every labouring man, whether free or convict, was obliged to  appear. On the following morning the settlers were called over, previous  to which, the governor, who was present, informed them, that he had heard  of much discontent prevailing among them in consequence of certain heavy  grievances which they said they laboured under. For these, as he was  unacquainted with the nature of them, he was unable to suggest any  remedy; he therefore desired that they might be represented to him in  writing; and, to spare them as much trouble as possible, he would direct  two gentlemen on whom he had much dependance"]]]
