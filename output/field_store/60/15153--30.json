This noise--for it  cannot be called a harmony--might equally well be produced by a howling  party of dogs and cats. Then followed long prayers--for only the  parson's voice could be heard--then more dirges, after which it was  over, and all trooped away, apparently much edified. One of the nurses  brought me some lunch and spread it on the rickety table, with a dirty  napkin as a tablecloth. As regards the food, which these young ladies  told me they took it in turn to cook, it was very fair; only one day we  got no meat and no meal; the other days they gave me eggs, very good  beef, splendid potatoes, and bread in any quantity. Besides this, I was  able to buy delicious fruit, both figs and apricots. As beverages there  were tea and coffee, the latter, of course, being the Transvaal national  drink--that is to say, when \"dop\" cannot be had. Beer is almost unknown,  except the imported kinds of Bass and Schlitz, for what is known as  \"Kaffir beer\" is a filthy decoction. About midday I received a formal  reply from Gordon, as follows:           \"MAFEKING,\" _December 3, 1899._         \"MY DEAR SARAH,         \"I am delighted to hear you are being well treated, but very       sorry to have to tell you that Colonel Baden-Powell finds it       impossible to hand over Petrus Viljoen in exchange for you, as       he was convicted of horse-stealing before the war. I fail to       see in what way it can benefit your captors to keep you a       prisoner. Luckily for them, it is not the custom of the       English to make prisoners of war of women.         \"GORDON WILSON.\"    Of course I was grievously disappointed, but at the same time I had  really expected no other answer, as I informed Mr. Brink (the General's  second secretary), who had brought me the letter. He was gravely  apologetic, and informed me the General and Commandant were holding a  Kriegsraad early on the following morning, when my case would receive  their full consideration. In the afternoon we had the excitement of  seeing the Pretoria coach drive up to the laager with much horn-blowing  and whip-cracking. Later some newspapers were brought across, and I was  able actually to peruse a Transvaal paper only two days old. The  General's other secretary, who presented them to me, made some  astounding statements, which he said had just come up on official  wires--namely, that England and Russia would be at war before that very  week was out, in what locality he did not know; and that Germany had  suddenly increased her fleet by many ships, spending thereon  L10,000,000. To this I ventured to remark that the building of those  ships would take four or five years, which would make it almost too late  to assist the Transvaal in the present war. I also reminded him casually  that Germany's Emperor and Empress were, according to their own papers,  then paying a visit to Queen Victoria, which did not look as if that  country was exactly unfriendly to England. To this he had nothing to  reply, and I saw that this imperial visit was a sore subject with my  entertainers. For this reason I made a point of referring to it on every  possible occasion. As I was eating my solitary supper, Mr. Brink  appeared with a letter from Colonel Baden-Powell as follows:           \"_December 5, 1899._         \"DEAR LADY SARAH,         \"I am so distressed about you. You must have been having an       awful time of it, and I can't help feeling very much to blame;       but I had hoped to save you the unpleasantness of the siege.         \"However, I trust now that your troubles are nearly over at       last, and that General Snyman will pass you in here.         \"We are all very well, and really rather enjoying it all.         \"I wrote last night asking for you to be exchanged for Mrs.       Delpoort, but had no answer, so have written again to-day, and       sincerely hope it will be all right.         \"Hope you are well, in spite of your troubles.         \"Yours sincerely,         \"R. BADEN-POWELL.\"      I then learnt from another letter that Mrs. Delpoort, who had originally  expressed the wish to leave Mafeking, where she was residing with many  other friends in the women's laager, had changed her mind, or her  relatives did not encourage her to leave the shelter of the town; for  the Staff had experienced some difficulty in persuading her to agree to  the exchange, even if General Snyman allowed the same. I asked if an  answer had been returned to the Colonel's letter, and Mr. Brink replied  in the negative. Very indignant, I said that I did not mean to be kept  in my present wretched quarters indefinitely, and that, if no exchange  could be effected, I would request a pass to return to Setlagoli, and  risk the scarcity of food. He looked rather confused, and said somewhat  timidly that no doubt the General would allow me to go to Pretoria,  where I should find \"pleasant ladies' society.\" Seeing my look of angry  surprise, he hastily added that he only wished he had a house of his own  to place at my disposal. I saw it was no use venting my annoyance on  this young man, who was civility itself, so I merely remarked I had no  intention of visiting their capital, and that the present was certainly  not a time for an English lady to travel alone in the Transvaal. To this  he gushingly agreed, but added that, of course, the General would give  me a proper escort. These words were quite enough to denote which way  the wind was blowing. I would not for an instant admit they had a right  to detain me or to send me to any place against my will, having come  there voluntarily, merely to ask the General a favour. I was therefore  conveniently blind and deaf, and, begging my amiable young friend to  submit Colonel Baden-Powell's suggestion to the Kriegsraad on the  following morning, and to apprise me of the result, I wished him  good-night, and went to bed once more on the wretched sofa, in anything  but a hopeful frame of mind. However, as is so often the case, my  spirits revived in the morning, and, on considering the situation, I  could not see what object the Transvaal authorities could have in  detaining me a prisoner. I was certainly very much in the way of the  hospital arrangements, and I fully made up my mind to refuse absolutely  to go to Pretoria, unless they took me by force. I also determined to  leave them no peace at the headquarters till they gave me a definite  reply. The day dragged on; the flies simply swarmed in my poky little  room. Never have I seen anything like the plague of these insects, but  the nurses assured me that at the laager itself they were far worse,  attracted, doubtless, by the cattle, horses, and food-stuffs. At length  I received a letter in an enormous official envelope, saying General  Snyman had wired to Pretoria about me, and expected an answer every  minute, which reply should be immediately communicated to me. By my own  free will I had put myself completely in their power. This did not  prevent me, however, from speaking my mind freely on what I termed \"the  extraordinary treatment I was receiving,\" to both of the secretaries, to  the nurses, and to the patients. The latter, being men, were very  sympathizing; the nurses, though kind and attentive, were not quite so  friendly, and seemed somewhat suspicious of my business. Neither of  these, I ascertained, had gone through any previous training, but had  volunteered their services, as they thought it \"would be a lark.\"  Whether their expectations were realized was doubtful, as they told me  they were worked off their legs; that they had to cook, wash their  clothes, and clean out the wretched little rooms, besides looking after  the patients. In addition to these two girls there was a \"lady doctor,\"  the first of her species I had ever come across, and with whom I was not  favourably impressed. Very untidy in her appearance, her head covered  with curls, her costume composed of the remnants of showy finery, this  lady had been a handsome woman, but her personality, combined with a  very discontented expression of countenance, did not exactly form one's  idea of a substitute for the skilful, kind, and cheerful hospital doctor  that we know at home. In fact, she looked singularly out of place, which  I remarked to several people, partly from the irritation I felt on  hearing her addressed as \"Doctor.\" No doubt these remarks were repeated  to her, and this accounted for her black looks.    I must not omit a few words about the patients and visitors of the  hospital, with all of whom I was most friendly. One and all were  exceedingly civil, and I never encountered any rudeness whatever. Even  the burghers of no importance, poorly clad, out at elbow, and of starved  appearance, who came to the hospital for advice and medicines, all alike  made me a rough salutation, evidently the best they were acquainted  with. Those of more standing nearly always commenced to chat in very  good English; in fact, I think a great many came up with the purpose of  observing the captured _rara avis_, an Englishwoman. We did not actually  discuss the progress of the war and what led to it, sticking more to  generalities. One hope was universally expressed, that it would soon be  over, and this I heartily re-echoed. I told one of them I thought they  had been foolish to destroy all the railway-line, as it had left their  own people so terribly short of food; to this he replied that such minor  matters could not be helped, that they must all suffer alike and help  each other; also that they were well aware that they were taking on a  very great Power, and that every nerve must be strained if they could  hope for success. So another day and night passed. I continued to send  down letters without end to headquarters; but it was always the same  answer: they were waiting for the reply from Pretoria.

Your contracts provide, I understand, for six months'  notice. It goes without saying that you continue to draw your salary  until the expiration of this term.    BOLZ (_rising_).    You are very kind, Mr. von Senden. Our contracts empower us to edit  the paper as we see fit, and to control its tone and its party  affiliations. For the next half-year, therefore, we shall not only  continue to draw our salaries but also to conduct the paper for the  benefit of the party to which you have not the honor to belong.    SENDEN (_angrily_).    We'll find a way to prevent that!    OLDENDORF.    Calm yourself. That kind of work would scarcely be worthy of us. If  such are the circumstances, I announce that I resign the editorship  from today, and release you from all obligations to me.    BOLZ.    I don't mind. I make the same announcement.

Hold on, gentlemen, don't be too generous. It is all right for you to  take no further part in editing the paper if your friends withdraw.  But why abandon your pecuniary claims on the new owner?    BELLMAUS.    I'd rather take nothing at all from them; I'll follow your example.    BOLZ (_stroking him_).    Noble sentiment, my son! We'll make our way in the world together.  What do you think of a hand-organ, Bellmaus! We 'll take it to fairs  and sing your songs through. I'll turn and you'll sing.    OLDENDORF.    Since the new owner of the paper is not one of you, you will, in  concluding this transaction, find the question only natural--To whom  have we ceded our rights?    SENDEN.    The present owner of the paper is--    _Enter_ COLONEL _through side door on the left_.    OLDENDORF (_starting back in alarm_).    Colonel!    BOLZ.    Ah, now it is becoming high tragedy!    COLONEL.    First of all, Professor, be assured that I have nothing to do with  this whole affair, and merely come at the request of the purchaser.  Not until I came here, did I know anything of what was going on. I  hope you will take my word for that.    BOLZ.    Well, I find this game unseemly, and I insist on being told who this  new owner is who mysteriously hides behind different persons!    _Enter_ ADELAIDE _from the side door, left._    ADELAIDE.    He stands before you!    BOLZ.    I should just like to faint.    BELLMAUS.    That is a heavenly joke!    ADELAIDE (_bowing_).    How do you do, gentlemen! [_To the staff_.] Am I right in assuming  that these gentlemen have hitherto been connected with editing the  paper?    BELLMAUS (_eagerly_).    Yes, Miss Runeck! Mr. Kaempe for leading articles, Mr. Koerner for the  French and English correspondence, and I for theatre, music, fine  arts, and miscellaneous.    ADELAIDE.    I shall be much pleased if your principles will let you continue  devoting your talents to my newspaper. [_The three members of the  staff bow_.]    BELLMAUS (_laying his hand on his heart_).    Miss Runeck, under your editorship I'll go to the ends of the world!    ADELAIDE (_smiling and politely_).    Ah, no, merely into that room.    [_Points to the door on the right_.]    I  need half an hour to collect my thoughts for my new activities.    BELLMAUS (_while departing_).    That's the best thing I ever heard!    [BELLMAUS, KAeMPE, KOeRNER _leave_.]    ADELAIDE.    Professor, you resigned the management of the paper with a readiness  which delights me. (_Pointedly_.) I wish to edit the _Union_ in my  own fashion.    [_Seizes his hand and leads him to the_ COLONEL.]    Colonel, he is no longer editor; we have outwitted him; you have your  satisfaction.    COLONEL (_holding out his arms to him_).    Come, Oldendorf! For what happened I have been sorry since the moment  we parted.    OLDENDORF.    My honored friend!    ADELAIDE (_pointing to the door on the left_).    There is some one else in there who wants to take part in the  reconciliation. It might be Mr. Gabriel Henning.    IDA _appears at the side door_.    IDA.    Edward!    [OLDENDORF _hurries to the door_, IDA _meets him, he embraces  her. Both leave on the left. The_ COLONEL _follows_.]    ADELAIDE (_sweetly_).    Before asking you, Mr. von Senden, to interest yourself in the editing  of the newspaper, I beg you to read through this correspondence which  I received as a contribution to my columns.    SENDEN (_takes a glance at them_).    Miss Runeck, I don't know whose indiscretion--    ADELAIDE.    Fear none on my part. I am a newspaper proprietor, and (_with, marked  emphasis_) shall keep editorial secrets.    [SENDEN _bows_.]    May I ask  for the deed, Judge? And will you gentlemen be kind enough to ease the  mind of the vendor as to the outcome of the transaction?    [_Mutual  bows_. SENDEN _and_ SCHWARZ _leave_.]    ADELAIDE (_after a short pause_).    Now, Mr. Bolz, what am I going to do about you?    BOLZ.    I am prepared for anything. I am surprised at nothing any more. If  some one should go straight off and spend a capital of a hundred  millions in painting negroes white with oil-colors, or in making  Africa four-cornered, I should not let it astonish me. If I wake up  tomorrow as an owl with two tufts of feathers for ears and a mouse in  my beak, I will say, \"All right,\" and remember that worse things have  happened.    ADELAIDE.    What is the matter with you, Conrad? Are you displeased with me?    BOLZ.    With you? You have been generous as ever; only too generous. And it  would all have been fine, if only this whole scene had been  impossible. That fellow Senden!    ADELAIDE.    We have seen the last of him! Conrad, I'm one of the party!    BOLZ.    Hallelujah! I hear countless angels blowing on their trumpets! I'll  stay with the _Union_!    ADELAIDE.    About that I am no longer the one to decide. For I have still a  confession to make to you. I, too, am not the real owner of the  newspaper.    BOLZ.    You are not? Now, by all the gods, I am at my wit's end. I'm beginning  not to care who this owner is. Be he man, will-of-the-wisp, or the  devil Beelzebub in person, I bid him defiance.    ADELAIDE.    He is a kind of a will-of-the-wisp, a little something of a devil, and  from top to toe a great rogue. For, Conrad, my friend, beloved of my  youth, it is you yourself.    [_Hands him the deed_.]    BOLZ (_stupefied for a moment, reads_).    \"Ceded to Conrad Bolz\"--correct! So that would be a sort of gift.  Can't be accepted, much too little!    [_Throws the paper aside_.]  Prudence be gone!    [_Falls on his knees before_ ADELAIDE.]    Here I  kneel, Adelaide! What I am saying I don't know in my joy, for the  whole room is dancing round with me. If you will take me for your  husband, you will do me the greatest favor in the world. If you don't  want me, box my ears and send me off!    ADELAIDE (_bending down to him_).    I do want you! (_Kissing him_.) This was the cheek!    BOLZ.    And these are the lips.    [_Kisses her; they remain in an embrace; short  pause_.]    _Enter_ COLONEL, IDA, OLDENDORF.    COLONEL (_in amazement, at the door_).    What is this?    BOLZ.    Colonel, it takes place under editorial sanction.    COLONEL.    Adelaide, what do I see?    ADELAIDE (_stretching out her hand to the_ COLONEL).    Dear friend, I'm betrothed to a journalist!

Assistant Professor of German, Tufts  College.      Some well-meaning men still wish that the defects of their old church  had not led to so great a revolt, and even liberal Roman Catholics  still fail to see in Luther and Zwingli anything but zealous heretics  whose wrath brought about a schism. May such views vanish from  Germany! All religious denominations have reason to attribute to  Luther whatever in their present faith is genuine and sincere, and has  a wholesome and sustaining influence. The heretic of Wittenberg is  fully as much the reformer of the German Catholics as of the  Protestants. This is true not only because the teachers of the  Catholic Church in their struggle against him outgrew the old  scholasticism, and fought for their sacraments with new weapons gained  from his language, his culture, and his moral worth; nor because he,  in effect, destroyed the church of the Middle Ages and forced his  opponents at Trent to raise a firmer structure, though seemingly  within the old forms and proportions; but still more because he  expressed the common basis of all German denominations, of our  spiritual courage, piety, and honesty, with such force that a good  deal of his own nature, to the present benefit of every German, has  survived in our doctrines and language, in our civil laws and morals,  in the thoughtfulness of our people, and in our science and  literature. Some of the ideas for which Luther's stubborn and  contentious spirit fought, against both Catholics and Calvinists, are  abandoned by the free investigation of modern times. His intensely  passionate beliefs, gained in the heartrending struggles of a devout  soul, occasionally missed an important truth. Sometimes he was harsh,  unfair, even cruel toward his opponents; but such things should no  longer disturb any German, for all the limitations of his nature and  training are as nothing compared with the fulness of the blessings  which have flowed from his great heart into the life of our nation.    But he should not have seceded after all, some people say; for his  action has divided Germany into two hostile camps, and the ancient  strife, under varying battle-cries, has continued to"]]]
