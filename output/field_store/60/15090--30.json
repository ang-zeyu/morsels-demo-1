The eggs of this species, of which I have now received many, appear to  be typically somewhat elongated ovals, and not unfrequently they are  more or less pyriform or even cylindrical. As a rule, they are fairly  glossy, a bright pale, somewhat greenish blue, quite spotless, and  varying a little in tint. In length they appear to vary from 1.11 to  1.25, and in breadth from 0.82 to 0.91; but the average of eleven eggs  is 1.2 by 0.87.      93.

The Nilghiri Laughing-Thrush breeds, according to my many informants,  throughout the more elevated portions of the mountains from which it  derives its trivial name, from February to the beginning of June.    A nest of this species sent me by Mr. H.R.P. Carter, who took it  at Coonoor on April 22nd (when it contained two fresh eggs), is  externally a rather coarse clumsy structure, composed of roots, dead  leaves, small twigs, and a little lichen, about 5 inches in diameter,  and standing about 41/2 inches high. The egg-cavity is, however, very  regularly shaped, and neatly lined with very fine grass-stems and a  little fine tow-like vegetable fibre. It is a deep cup, measuring 21/2  inches across and fully 33/4 inches in depth.    A nest taken by Miss Cockburn was a much more compact structure,  placed between four or five twigs. It was composed of coarse grass,  dead and skeleton leaves, a very little lichen, and a quantity of  moss. The egg-cavity was lined with very fine grass. The nest was  externally about 51/2 inches in diameter and nearly 6 inches in height,  but the egg-cavity had a diameter of only about 21/2 inches and was only  about 21/4 inches deep.    It was Jerdon, I believe, who gave the name of Laughing-Thrushes to  this group, and this name is applicable enough to this particular  bird, the one with which he was most familiar, for it does  _laugh_--albeit, a most maniacal laugh; but the majority of the group  have not the shadow of a giggle even in them, and should have been  designated \"Screaming Squabblers.\"    Mr. J. Darling, Jr., says:--\"This bird breeds from February to May.  I have found the nests all over the Nilghiris, at elevations of from  4500 to 7500 feet above the sea. The nest is placed indiscriminately  in any bush or tree that happens to take the bird's fancy, at heights  of from 3 to 12 feet from the ground.    \"In shape it is circular, a deep cup, externally some 6 inches in  diameter and 5 or 6 inches in height, and with a cavity 3 to 4 inches  wide and often fully 4 inches in depth. The nest is composed of moss  and small twigs, at times of grass mingled with some spiders' webs:  sometimes there is a foundation of dead leaves. The cavity is lined  with fur, cotton-wool, feathers, &c.    \"The eggs are two or three in number.\"    Mr. Wait, writing from Coonoor, says:--\"_T. cachinnans_ breeds about  May, and lays from three to five oval eggs. The ground is bluish, with  ash-coloured and brown spots and blotches, and occasionally marks.\"  None of my other correspondents, however, admit that the bird ever  lays more than three eggs.    Mr. Davison tells me that \"this bird breeds commonly on the Nilghiris,  just before the rains set in, in May and the earlier part of June, but  it occasionally breeds earlier (in April) or later (in the latter  end of June). The nest is cup-shaped, composed of dead leaves, moss,  grass, &c., and lined with a few moss-roots or fine grass. It is  placed in the fork of a branch about 6 or 8 feet from the ground. The  eggs are a bluish green, mottled chiefly towards the larger end, and  sometimes also streaked with purplish brown. The normal number of eggs  is two; sometimes, however, three are laid.\"    From Kotagherry, Miss Cockburn remarks:--\"The name 'Laughing-Thrush'  is most applicable to this bird, and its notes are often mistaken for  the sound of the human voice. This bird is very shy, except when its  nest contains eggs or young, when it becomes extremely bold. I was  quite surprised to see a pair whose nest I was taking come so close  as to induce me to put out my hand to catch them. The Laughing-Thrush  builds a pretty, though large, nest, and generally selects the forked  branches of a thick bush, and commences its nest with a large quantity  of moss, after which there is a lining of fine grass and roots, and  the withered fibrous covering of the Peruvian Cherry (_Physalis  peruviana_), the nest being finished with a few feathers, in general  belonging to the bird. The inside of the nest is perfectly round, and  rarely contains more than two eggs, belonging to the owner. The eggs  are of a beautiful greenish-blue colour, with a few large and small  brown blotches and streaks, mostly at the large end. I have found the  nests of these birds in February, March, and April. Occasionally the  Black-and-white Crested Cuckoo, which appears on these hills in the  month of March, deposits its eggs (two in number) in the nest of  this Thrush. They are easily distinguished, as their colour is quite  different from the Thrush's eggs, being entirely dark bluish green.\"    Mr. Rhodes W. Morgan writing from South India, says, in 'The  Ibis':--\"It builds a very neat nest of moss, dried leaves, and the  outer husk of the fruit of the Brazil Cherry, lined with feathers,  bits of fur, and other soft substances. The nest is cup-shaped, and  generally contains three eggs, most peculiarly marked with blotches,  streaks, and wavy lines of a dark claret-colour on a light blue  ground. The markings are almost always at the larger end.\"    The first specimens that I obtained of the eggs of this species were  kindly sent to me by the late Captain Mitchell and Mr. H.R.P. Carter  of Madras; they were taken on the Nilghiris. They are moderately broad  ovals, somewhat pointed towards one end, larger than the average eggs  of _T. lineatum_, and about the same size as large specimens of the  eggs of _Crateropus canorus_ and _Argya malcolmi_. The ground-colour  is of a delicate pale blue, and towards the large end, and sometimes  over the whole surface, they are speckled, spotted, and blotched, but  only sparingly, with brownish red and blackish brown, and amongst  these markings a few cloudy streaks and spots of dull faint reddish  purple are observable. The eggs have not much gloss.    Numerous other specimens subsequently received from Miss Cockburn  and others correspond well with the above description. More or less  pyriform varieties are common. In some eggs the markings are almost  entirely wanting, there being only a very faint brownish-pink  freckling at the large end; and in many eggs, even some that are  profusely spotted all over, the markings consist only of darker or  lighter brownish-pink shades. Occasionally a few, almost black,  twisted lines are intermingled with the other markings, and in these  cases the lines are frequently surrounded by a reddish-purple nimbus.    The eggs vary in length from 0.92 to 1.08, and in breadth from 0.74 to  0.8, but the average of twenty eggs measured was 1.0 by 0.76.      96. Trochalopterum fairbanki, Blanf. _The Palni Laughing-Thrush_.    Trochalopterum fairbanki, _Blanf., Hume, Cat._ no. 423 bis.    The Rev. S.B. Fairbank, the discoverer of this species, found its nest  at Kodai Kanal, in the Palni Hills, in May. The nest was placed in  the crotch of a tree, at about 10 feet from the ground, and at an  elevation of nearly 6500 feet above the level of the sea. The eggs  are moderately elongated ovals, with a fine, fairly glossy shell. The  ground is pale greenish blue or bluish green; the markings are spots,  small blotches, hair-lines, and hieroglyphic-like scrawls, rather  thinly scattered about the surface, and varying in colour through  several shades of brownish and reddish purple to bright claret-colour.    The only egg I have measures 1 inch in length by 0.8 inch in breadth.      99. Trochalopterum lineatum (Vig.). _The Himalayan Streaked  Laughing-Thrush_.    Trochalopteron lineatum (_Vig.), Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 50; _Hume,  Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 425[A].    [Footnote A: I omit the note on _T. imbricatum_ in the 'Rough Draft,'  because, as I have shown in the 'Birds of India,' this bird was  unknown to Hodgson, and his note refers to _T. lineatum_. Sufficient  is now known about the nidification of this latter to render the  insertion of Hodgson's note unnecessary.--ED.]    Next to the Common House-Sparrow, the Himalayan Streaked  Laughing-Thrush is perhaps the most familiar bird about our houses  at all the hill-stations of the Himalayas westward of Nepal and  throughout the lower ranges on which these stations are situated; this  species breeds at elevations of from 5000 to 8000 feet.    It lays from the end of April to the beginning of September, and very  possibly occasionally even earlier and later. I took a nest on the  29th April near Mussoorie; Mr. Brooks obtained eggs in May and June at  Almorah; Colonel G.F.L. Marshall at Mussoorie in July and August; and  Colonel C.H.T. Marshall at Murree from May to the end of July. I again  took them in July and August near Simla, and Captain Beavan found them  as late as the 6th of September near the same station.    So far as my own experience goes, the nests are always placed in  very thick bushes or in low thick branches of some tree, the Deodar  appearing to be a great favourite. Those I found averaged about 4 feet  from the ground, but I took a single one in a Deodar tree fully 8 feet  up. The bird, as a rule, conceals its nest so well that, though a  loose and, for the size of the architect, a large structure, it is  difficult to find, even when one closely examines the bush in which it  is. The nest is nearly circular, with a deep cup-like cavity in the  centre, reminding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#20)"],[1,"noun with an insincerity  of flourish that was quite in the spirit of his text, when he heard a  gentle tapping. The woodpeckers had been busy about the roof during  the day, and the noise did not disturb his work. But the opening of the  door, and the tapping continuing from the inside, caused him to look  up. He was slightly startled by the figure of a young girl, dirty  and shabbily clad. Still, her great black eyes, her coarse, uncombed,  lusterless black hair falling over her sunburned face, her red arms  and feet streaked with the red soil, were all familiar to him. It was  Melissa Smith--Smith's motherless child.    \"What can she want here?\" thought the master. Everybody knew \"Mliss,\"  as she was called, throughout the length and height of Red Mountain.  Everybody knew her as an incorrigible girl. Her fierce, ungovernable  disposition, her mad freaks and lawless character, were in their way  as proverbial as the story of her father's weaknesses, and as  philosophically accepted by the townsfolk. She wrangled with and fought  the schoolboys with keener invective and quite as powerful arm. She  followed the trails with a woodman's craft, and the master had met  her before, miles away, shoeless, stockingless, and bareheaded on the  mountain road. The miners' camps along the stream supplied her with  subsistence during these voluntary pilgrimages, in freely offered alms.  Not but that a larger protection had been previously extended to Mliss.  The Rev. Joshua McSnagley, \"stated\" preacher, had placed her in the  hotel as servant, by way of preliminary refinement, and had introduced  her to his scholars at Sunday school. But she threw plates occasionally  at the landlord, and quickly retorted to the cheap witticisms of the  guests, and created in the Sabbath school a sensation that was so  inimical to the orthodox dullness and placidity of that institution  that, with a decent regard for the starched frocks and unblemished  morals of the two pink-and-white-faced children of the first families,  the reverend gentleman had her ignominiously expelled. Such were the  antecedents, and such the character of Mliss as she stood before the  master. It was shown in the ragged dress, the unkempt hair, and bleeding  feet, and asked his pity. It flashed from her black, fearless eyes, and  commanded his respect.    \"I come here tonight,\" she said rapidly and boldly, keeping her hard  glance on his, \"because I knew you was alone. I wouldn't come here when  them gals was here. I hate 'em and they hates me. That's why. You keep  school, don't you? I want to be teached!\"    If to the shabbiness of her apparel and uncomeliness of her tangled hair  and dirty face she had added the humility of tears, the master would  have extended to her the usual moiety of pity, and nothing more. But  with the natural, though illogical, instincts of his species, her  boldness awakened in him something of that respect which all original  natures pay unconsciously to one another in any grade. And he gazed at  her the more fixedly as she went on still rapidly, her hand on that door  latch and her eyes on his:    \"My name's Mliss--Mliss Smith! You can bet your life on that. My  father's Old Smith--Old Bummer Smith--that's what's the matter with him.  Mliss Smith--and I'm coming to school!\"    \"Well?\" said the master.    Accustomed to be thwarted and opposed, often wantonly and cruelly, for  no other purpose than to excite the violent impulses of her nature, the  master's phlegm evidently took her by surprise. She stopped; she began  to twist a lock of her hair between her fingers; and the rigid line  of upper lip, drawn over the wicked little teeth, relaxed and quivered  slightly. Then her eyes dropped, and something like a blush struggled up  to her cheek and tried to assert itself through the splashes of redder  soil, and the sunburn of years. Suddenly she threw herself forward,  calling on God to strike her dead, and fell quite weak and helpless,  with her face on the master's desk, crying and sobbing as if her heart  would break.    The master lifted her gently and waited for the paroxysm to pass. When,  with face still averted, she was repeating between her sobs the MEA  CULPA of childish penitence--that \"she'd be good, she didn't mean to,\"  etc., it came to him to ask her why she had left Sabbath school.    Why had she left the Sabbath school?--why? Oh, yes. What did he  (McSnagley) want to tell her she was wicked for? What did he tell her  that God hated her for? If God hated her, what did she want to go to  Sabbath school for? SHE didn't want to be \"beholden\" to anybody who  hated her.    Had she told McSnagley this?    Yes, she had.    The master laughed. It was a hearty laugh, and echoed so oddly in the  little schoolhouse, and seemed so inconsistent and discordant with the  sighing of the pines without, that he shortly corrected himself with  a sigh. The sigh was quite as sincere in its way, however, and after a  moment of serious silence he asked about her father.    Her father? What father? Whose father? What had he ever done for her?  Why did the girls hate her? Come now! what made the folks say, \"Old  Bummer Smith's Mliss!\" when she passed? Yes; oh yes. She wished he was  dead--she was dead--everybody was dead; and her sobs broke forth anew.    The master then, leaning over her, told her as well as he could what you  or I might have said after hearing such unnatural theories from childish  lips; only bearing in mind perhaps better than you or I the unnatural  facts of her ragged dress, her bleeding feet, and the omnipresent shadow  of her drunken father. Then, raising her to her feet, he wrapped his  shawl around her, and, bidding her come early in the morning, he walked  with her down the road. There he bade her \"good night.\" The moon shone  brightly on the narrow path before them. He stood and watched the bent  little figure as it staggered down the road, and waited until it had  passed the little graveyard and reached the curve of the hill, where it  turned and stood for a moment, a mere atom of suffering outlined against  the far-off patient stars. Then he went back to his work. But the lines  of the copybook thereafter faded into long parallels of never-ending  road, over which childish figures seemed to pass sobbing and crying into  the night. Then, the little schoolhouse seeming lonelier than before, he  shut the door and went home.    The next morning Mliss came to school. Her face had been washed, and her  coarse black hair bore evidence of recent struggles with the comb,  in which both had evidently suffered. The old defiant look shone  occasionally in her eyes, but her manner was tamer and more subdued.  Then began a series of little trials and self-sacrifices, in which  master and pupil bore an equal part, and which increased the confidence  and sympathy between them. Although obedient under the master's eye,  at times during recess, if thwarted or stung by a fancied slight, Mliss  would rage in ungovernable fury, and many a palpitating young savage,  finding himself matched with his own weapons of torment, would seek  the master with torn jacket and scratched face and complaints of the  dreadful Mliss. There was a serious division among the townspeople on  the subject, some threatening to withdraw their children from such evil  companionship, and others as warmly upholding the course of the master  in his work of reclamation. Meanwhile, with a steady persistence that  seemed quite astonishing to him on looking back afterward, the master  drew Mliss gradually out of the shadow of her past life, as though it  were but her natural progress down the narrow path on which he had  set her feet the moonlit night of their first meeting. Remembering the  experience of the evangelical McSnagley, he carefully avoided that Rock  of Ages on which that unskillful pilot had shipwrecked her young faith.  But if, in the course of her reading, she chanced to stumble upon those  few words which have lifted such as she above the level of the older,  the wiser, and the more prudent--if she learned something of a faith  that is symbolized by suffering, and the old light softened in her eyes,  it did not take the shape of a lesson. A few of the plainer people had  made up a little sum by which the ragged Mliss was enabled to assume  the garments of respect and civilization; and often a rough shake of  the hand, and words of homely commendation from a red-shirted and burly  figure, sent a glow to the cheek of the young master, and set him to  thinking if it was altogether deserved.    Three months had passed from the time of their first meeting, and the  master was sitting late one evening over the moral and sententious  copies, when there came a tap at the door and again Mliss stood before  him. She was neatly clad and clean-faced, and there was nothing perhaps  but the long black hair and bright black eyes to remind him of his  former apparition. \"Are you busy?\" she asked. \"Can you come with  me?\"--and on his signifying his readiness, in her old willful way she  said, \"Come, then, quick!\"    They passed out of the door together and into the dark road. As they  entered the town the master asked her whither she was going. She  replied, \"To see my father.\"    It was the first time he had heard her call him by that filial title, or  indeed anything more than \"Old Smith\" or the \"Old Man.\" It was the first  time in three months that she had spoken of him at all, and the master  knew she had kept resolutely aloof from him since her great change.  Satisfied from her manner that it was fruitless to question her purpose,  he passively followed. In out-of-the-way places, low groggeries,  restaurants, and saloons; in gambling hells and dance houses, the  master, preceded by Mliss, came and went. In the reeking smoke and  blasphemous outcries of low dens, the child, holding the master's hand,  stood and anxiously gazed, seemingly unconscious of all in "]]]
