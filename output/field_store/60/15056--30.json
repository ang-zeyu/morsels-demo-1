But, on the whole, a  good many such acts, though punishable by law, may come under a certain  kind of nemesis which internal impotence is forced to bring about. In  entering upon opposition to the superior talents and virtues, by which  impotence feels oppressed, it comes to a realization of its inferiority  and to a consciousness of its own nothingness, and the nemesis, even  when bad and odious, is, by treating it with contempt, rendered  ineffectual. Like the public, which forms a circle for such activity, it  is confined to a harmless malicious joy, and to a condemnation which  reflects upon itself.      MEANING OF WAR    There is an ethical element in war. It must not be regarded as an  absolute ill, or as merely an external calamity which is accidentally  based upon the passions of despotic individuals or nations, upon acts of  injustice, and, in general, upon what ought not to be. The recognition  of the finite, such as property and life, as accidental, is necessary.  This necessity is at first wont to appear under the form of a force of  nature, for all things finite are mortal and transient. In the ethical  order, in the State, however, nature is robbed of its force, and the  necessity is exalted to a work of freedom, to an ethical law. The  transient and negative nature of all things is transformed in the State  into an expression of the ethical will. War, often painted by edifying  speech as a state in which the vanity of temporal things is  demonstrated, now becomes an element whereby the ideal character of the  particular receives its right and reality. War has the deep meaning that  by it the ethical health of the nations is preserved and their finite  aims uprooted. And as the winds which sweep over the ocean prevent the  decay that would result from its perpetual calm, so war protects the  people from the corruption which an everlasting peace would bring upon  it. History shows phases which illustrate how successful wars have  checked internal unrest and have strengthened the entire stability of  the State.    In peace, civic life becomes more extended, every sphere is hedged in  and grows immobile, and at last all men stagnate, their particular  nature becoming more and more hardened and ossified. Only in the unity  of a body is health, and, where the organs become stiff, there is death.  Eternal peace is often demanded as an ideal toward which mankind should  move. Thus Kant proposed an alliance of princes, which should settle the  controversies of States, and the Holy Alliance probably aspired to be an  institution of this kind. The State, however, is individual, and in  individuality negation is essentially contained. A number of States may  constitute themselves into a family, but this confederation, as an  individuality, must create an opposition and so beget an enemy. Not only  do nations issue forth invigorated from their wars, but those nations  torn by internal strife win peace at home as a result of war abroad. War  indeed causes insecurity in property, but this real insecurity is only a  necessary commotion. From the pulpits much is preached concerning the  insecurity, vanity, and instability of temporal things, and yet every  one, though he may be touched by his own words, thinks that he, at  least, will manage to hold on to his possessions. Let the insecurity  finally come, in the form of Hussars with glistening sabres, and show  its earnest activity, and that touching edification which foresaw all  this now turns upon the enemy with curses. In spite of this, wars will  break out whenever necessity demands them; but the seeds spring up anew,  and speech is silenced before the grave repetitions of history.    The military class is the class of universality. The defense of the  State is its privilege, and its duty is to realize the ideality  contained in it, which consists in self-sacrifice. There are different  kinds of bravery. The courage of the animal, or the robber, the bravery  which arises from a sense of honor, the chivalrous bravery, are not yet  the true forms of it. In civilized nations true bravery consists in the  readiness to give oneself wholly to the service of the State, so that  the individual counts but as one among many. Not personal valor, but the  important aspect of it, lies in self-subordination to the universal  cause.    To risk one's life is indeed something more than mere fear of death, but  this is only negative; only a positive character--an aim and  content--gives meaning to bravery. Robbers and murderers in the pursuit  of crime, adventurers in the search of their fanciful objects, etc.,  also possess courage, and do not fear death. The principle of the modern  world--the power of thought and of the universal--has given to bravery a  higher form; the higher form causes the expression of bravery to appear  more mechanical. The brave deeds are not the deeds of any particular  person, but those of the members of a whole. And, again, since hostility  is directed, not against separate individuals, but against a hostile  whole, personal valor appears as impersonal. This principle it is which  has caused the invention of the gun; it is not a chance invention that  has brought about the change of the mere personal form of bravery into  the more abstract.      INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS    Just as the individual is not a real person unless related to other  persons, so the State is no real individuality unless related to other  States. The legitimate power of a State, and more especially its  princely power, is, from the point of view of its foreign relations, a  wholly internal affair. A State shall, therefore, not interfere with the  internal affairs of another State. On the other hand, for a complete  State, it is essential that it be recognized by others; but this  recognition demands as a guarantee that it shall recognize those States  which recognize it, and shall respect their independence. Hence its  internal affairs cannot be a matter of indifference to them.    When Napoleon, before the peace of Campoformio, said, \"The French  Republic requires recognition as little as the sun needs to be  recognized,\" his words suggest nothing but the strength of existence,  which already carries with it the guarantee of recognition, without  needing to be expressed.    When the particular wills of the State can come to no agreement their  controversy can be decided only by war. What offense shall be regarded  as a breach of a treaty, or as a violation of respect and honor, must  remain indefinite, since many and various injuries can easily accrue  from the wide range of the interests of the States and from the complex  relations of their citizens. The State may identify its infinitude and  honor with every one of its single aspects. And if a State, as a strong  individuality, has experienced an unduly protracted internal rest, it  will naturally be more inclined to irritability, in order to find an  occasion and field for intense activity.    The nations of Europe form a family according to the universal principle  of their legislation, their ethical code, and their civilization. But  the relation among States fluctuates, and no judge exists to adjust  their differences. The higher judge is the universal and absolute Spirit  alone--the World-Spirit.    The relation of one particular State to another presents, on the largest  possible scale, the most shifting play of individual passions,  interests, aims, talents, virtues, power, injustice, vice, and mere  external chance. It is a play in which even the ethical whole, the  independence of the State, is exposed to accident. The principles which  control the many national spirits are limited. Each nation as an  existing individuality is guided by its particular principles, and only  as a particular individuality can each national spirit win objectivity  and self-consciousness; but the fortunes and deeds of States in their  relation to one another reveal the dialectic of the finite nature of  these spirits. Out of this dialectic rises the universal Spirit, the  unlimited World-Spirit, pronouncing its judgment--and its judgment is  the highest--upon the finite nations of the world's history; for the  history of the world is the world's court of justice.          INTRODUCTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF ART (1820-21)    BY GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL    TRANSLATED BY J. LOEWENBERG, PH.D. Assistant in Philosophy, Harvard  University    THE MEANING OF ART      The appropriate expression for our subject is the \"Philosophy of Art,\"  or, more precisely, the \"Philosophy of Fine Arts.\" By this expression we  wish to exclude the beauty of nature. In common life we are in the habit  of speaking of beautiful color, a beautiful sky, a beautiful river,  beautiful flowers, beautiful animals, and beautiful human beings. But  quite aside from the question, which we wish not to discuss here, how  far beauty may be predicated of such objects, or how far natural beauty  may be placed side by side with artistic beauty, we must begin by  maintaining that artistic beauty is higher than the beauty of nature.  For the beauty of art is beauty born--and born again--of the spirit. And  as spirit and its products stand higher than nature and its phenomena,  by so much the beauty that resides in art is superior to the beauty of  nature.    To say that spirit and artistic beauty stand higher than natural beauty,  is to say very little, for \"higher\" is a very indefinite expression,  which states the difference between them as quantitative and external.  The \"higher\" quality of spirit and of artistic beauty does not at all  stand in a merely relative position to nature. Spirit only is the true  essence and content of the world, so that whatever is beautiful is truly  beautiful only when it partakes of this higher essence and is produced  by it. In this sense natural beauty appears only as a reflection of the  beauty that belongs to spirit; it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#20)"],[1,"e, throw in the  clutch, and gain some power from the momentum of the fly-wheel,  and many a bad place may be surmounted step by step in this way;  but this process has its limitations also, and the fact remains  that with a gasoline machine it is possible to carry a given load  only so fast, but if the machine moves it all, it will continue to  move on until the load is increased, or the road changes for the  worse.    When the farmer hears of an eight horse-power machine he thinks of  the wonderful things eight good horses can do on the road, and is  surprised when the machine fails to go up hills that teams travel  every day; he does not understand it, and wonders where the power  comes in. He is not enough of a mechanic to reflect that the eight  horse-power is demonstrated in the carrying of a ton over average  roads one hundred and fifty miles in ten hours, something eight  horses could not possibly do.    Just as we were entering the valley of Lebanon, beyond the village  of Brainerd, while going down a slight descent, my Companion  exclaimed,--    \"The wheel is coming off.\" I threw out the clutch, applied the  brake, looked, and saw the left front wheel roll gracefully and  quite deliberately out from under the big metal mud guard; the  carriage settled down at that corner, and the end of the axle  ploughed a furrow in the road for a few feet, when we came to a  stop.    The steering-head had broken short off at the inside of the hub.  We were not going very fast at the time, and the heavy metal mud  guard which caught the wheel, acting as a huge brake, saved us  from a bad smash.    On examination, the shank of the steering-head was found to  contain two large flaws, which reduced its strength more than  one-half, and the surprising thing was that it had not parted long  before, when subjected to much severer strains.    This was a break that no man could repair on the road. Under  pressure of circumstances the steering-head could have been taken  to the nearest blacksmith shop and a weld made, but that would  require time, and the results would be more than doubtful. By far  the easier thing to do was to wire the factory for a new head and  patiently wait its coming.    Happily, we landed in the hands of a retired farmer, whose  generous hospitality embraced our tired selves as well as the  machine.    Before supper a telegram was sent from Brainerd to the factory for  a new steering-head.    While waiting inside for the operator to finish selling tickets  for the one evening train about to arrive, a curious crowd  gathered outside about my host, and the questions asked were  plainly audible; the names are fictitious.    \"What'r ye down t' the stashun fur this hur o' day, Joe?\"    \"Broke my new aut'mobile,\" carelessly replied my host, flicking a  fly off the nigh side of his horse.    \"Shu!\"    \"What'r given us?\"    \"Git out--\"    \"You ain't got no aut'mobile,\" chorused the crowd.    \"Mebbe I haven't; but if you fellows know an aut'mobile from a hay  rake, you might take a look in my big barn an' let me know what  you see.\"    \"Say, Joe, you're jokin',--hev you really got one?\"    \"You can look for yourselves.\"    \"I saw one go through here 'bout six o'clock,\" interrupted a  new-comer. \"Great Jehosephat, but 't went like a streak of greased  lightnin'.\"    \"War that your'n, Joe?\"    \"Well--\"    \"Naw,\" said the new-comer, scornfully. \"Joe ain't got no  aut'mobile; there's the feller in there now who runs it,\" and the  crowd turned my way with such interest that I turned to the little  table and wrote the despatch, quite losing the connection of the  subdued murmurs outside; but it was quite evident from the broken  exclamations that my host was filling the populace up with  information interesting inversely to its accuracy.    \"Mile a minute--faster'n a train--Holy Moses! what's that, Joe?  broke axle--telegraphed--how many--four more--you don't say so?--  what's his name? I'll bet it's Vanderbilt. Don't you believe it--  it costs money to run one of those machines. I'll bet he's a dandy  from 'way back--stopping at your house--bridal chamber--that's  right--you want to kill the fatted calf for them fellers--say--\"    But further comments were cut short as I came out, jumped in, and  we drove back to a good supper by candle-light.    The stars were shining over head, the air was clear and crisp,  down in the valley of Lebanon the mist was falling, and it was  cool that night. Lulled by the monotonous song of the tree-toad  and the deep bass croaking of frogs by the distant stream, we fell  asleep.    There was nothing to do next day. The new steering-head could not  possibly arrive until the morning following. As the farm was  worked by a tenant, our host had little to do, and proposed that  we drive to the Shaker village a few miles beyond.    The visit is well worth making, and we should have missed it  entirely if the automobile had not broken down, for the new State  road over the mountain does not go through the village, but back  of it. From the new road one can look down upon the cluster of  large buildings on the side of the mountain, but the old roads are  so very steep, with such interesting names as \"Devil's Elbow,\" and  the like, that they would not tempt an automobile. Many with  horses get out and walk at the worst places.    One wide street leads through the settlement; on each side are the  huge community buildings, seven in all, each occupied by a  \"family,\" so called, or community, and each quite independent in  its management and enterprises from the others; the common ties  being the meeting-house near the centre and the school-house a  little farther on.    We stopped at the North Family simply because it was the first at  hand, and we were hungry. Ushered into a little reception-room in  one of the outer buildings, we were obliged to wait for dinner  until the party preceding us had finished, for the little  dining-room devoted to strangers had only one table, seating but six  or eight, and it seemed to be the commendable policy of the  institution to serve each party separately.    A printed notice warned us that dinner served after one o'clock  cost ten cents per cover extra, making the extravagant charge of  sixty cents. We arrived just in time to be entitled to the regular  rate, but the dilatory tactics of the party in possession kept us  beyond the hour and involved us in the extra expense, with no  compensation in the shape of extra dishes. Morally and--having  tendered ourselves within the limit--legally we were entitled to  dine at the regular rate, or the party ahead should have paid the  additional tariff, but the good sister could not see the matter in  that light, plead ignorance of law, and relied entirely upon  custom.    The man who picks up a Shaker maiden for a fool will let her drop.    Having waited until nearly famished, the sister blandly told us,  as if it were a matter of local interest, but otherwise of small  consequence, that the North Family were strict vegetarians,  serving no meat whatsoever; the only meat family was at the other  end of the village.    We were ready for meat, for chickens, ducks, green goose, anything  that walked on legs; we were not ready for pumpkin, squash, boiled  potatoes, canned peas, and cabbage; but a theory as well as a  condition confronted us; it was give in or move on. We gave in,  but for fifteen cents more per plate bargained for preserves,  maple syrup, and honey,--for something cloying to deceive the  outraged palate.    But that dinner was a revelation of what a good cook can do with  vegetables in season; it was the quintessence of delicacy, the  refinement of finesse, the veritable apotheosis of the kitchen  garden; meat would have been brutal, the intrusion of a chop  inexcusable, the assertion of a steak barbarous, even a terrapin  would have felt quite out of place amidst things so fragrant and  impalpable as the marvellous preparations of vegetables from that  wonderful Shaker kitchen.    Everything was good, but the various concoctions of sweet corn  were better; and such sweet corn! it is still a savory  recollection.    Then the variety of preserves, jellies, and syrups; fifteen cents  extra were never bestowed to better advantage. We cast our coppers  upon the water and they returned Spanish galleons laden with good  things to eat.    After dining, we were walked through the various buildings, up  stairs and down, through kitchens, pantries, and cellars,--a wise  exercise after so bountiful a repast. In the cellar we drank  something from a bottle labelled \"Pure grape juice,\" one of those  non-alcoholic beverages with which the teetotaler whips the devil  around the stump; another glass would have made Shakers of us all,  for the juice of the grape in this instance was about twenty-five  per cent. proof. If the good sisters supply their worthy brothers  in faith with this stimulating cordial, it is not unlikely that  life in the village is less monotonous than is commonly supposed.  It certainly was calculated to add emphasis to the eccentricities  of even a \"Shaking Quaker.\"    Although the oldest and the wealthiest of all the socialistic  communities, there are only about six thousand Shakers in the  United States, less than one-fourth of what there were in former  times.    At Mt. Lebanon, the first founded of the several societies in this  country, there are seven families, or separate communities, each  with its own home and buildings. The present membership is about  one hundred and twenty, nearly all women,--scarcely enough men to  provide the requisite deacons for each family.    Large and well-managed schools are provided to attract children  from the outside world, and so recruit the diminishing ranks of  the faithful; but while many girls remain, the boys steal away to  the heathen world, where marriage is an institution.    Celibacy is the cardinal principle and the curse of Shakerism;"]]]
