It is supposed that he was the  prototype of Shakespeare's Falstaff, but beyond the resemblance in the  names there is little similarity in the exploits of the two \"heroes.\"  Sir John Fastolfe, much to the chagrin of other friends and relatives,  made John Paston his heir, who became a great and prosperous man,  represented his county in Parliament, and was a favourite of Edward  IV. Paston loved Caister, his \"fair jewell\"; but misfortunes befell  him. He had great losses, and was thrice confined in the Fleet Prison  and then outlawed. Those were dangerous days, and friends often  quarrelled. Hence during his troubles the Duke of Norfolk and Lord  Scales tried to get possession of Caister, and after his death laid  siege to it. The Pastons lacked not courage and determination, and  defended it for a year, but were then forced to surrender. However, it  was restored to them, but again forcibly taken from them. However, not  by the sword but by negotiations and legal efforts, Sir John again  gained his own, and an embattled tower at the north-west corner, one  hundred feet high, and the north and west walls remain to tell the  story of this brave old Norfolk family, who by their _Letters_ have  done so much to guide us through the dark period to which they relate.    [Illustration: Caister Castle 7 Aug 1908]    [Illustration: Defaced Arms. Taunton Castle]    We will journey to the West Country, a region of castles. The Saxons  were obliged to erect their rude earthen strongholds to keep back the  turbulent Welsh, and these were succeeded by Norman keeps.  Monmouthshire is famous for its castles. Out of the thousand erected  in Norman times twenty-five were built in that county. There is  Chepstow Castle with its Early Norman gateway spanned by a circular  arch flanked by round towers. In the inner court there are gardens  and ruins of a grand hall, and in the outer the remains of a chapel  with evidences of beautifully groined vaulting, and also a winding  staircase leading to the battlements. In the dungeon of the old keep  at the south-east corner of the inner court Roger de Britolio, Earl of  Hereford, was imprisoned for rebellion against the Conqueror, and in  later times Henry Martin, the regicide, lingered as a prisoner for  thirty years, employing his enforced leisure in writing a book in  order to prove that it is not right for a man to be governed by one  wife. Then there is Glosmont Castle, the fortified residence of the  Earl of Lancaster; Skenfrith Castle, White Castle, the _Album Castrum_  of the Latin records, the Landreilo of the Welsh, with its six towers,  portcullis and drawbridge flanked by massive towers, barbican, and  other outworks; and Raglan Castle with its splendid gateway, its  Elizabethan banqueting-hall ornamented with rich stone tracery, its  bowling-green, garden terraces, and spacious courts--an ideal place  for knightly tournaments. Raglan is associated with the gallant  defence of the castle by the Marquis of Worcester in the Civil War.    Another famous siege is connected with the old castle of Taunton.  Taunton was a noted place in Saxon days, and the castle is the  earliest English fortress by some two hundred years of which we have  any written historical record.[21] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler states,  under the date 722 A.D.: \"This year Queen Ethelburge overthrew  Taunton, which Ina had before built.\" The buildings tell their story.  We see a Norman keep built to the westward of Ina's earthwork,  probably by Henry de Blois, Bishop of Winchester, the warlike brother  of King Stephen. The gatehouse with the curtain ending in drum towers,  of which one only remains, was first built at the close of the  thirteenth century under Edward I; but it was restored with  Perpendicular additions by Bishop Thomas Langton, whose arms with the  date 1495 may be seen on the escutcheon above the arch. Probably  Bishop Langton also built the great hall; whilst Bishop Home, who is  sometimes credited with this work, most likely only repaired the hall,  but tacked on to it the southward structure on pilasters, which shows  his arms with the date 1577. The hall of the castle was for a long  period used as Assize Courts. The castle was purchased by the Taunton  and Somerset Archaeological Society, and is now most appropriately a  museum. Taunton has seen many strange sights. The town was owned by  the Bishop of Winchester, and the castle had its constable, an office  held by many great men. When Lord Daubeney of Barrington Court was  constable in 1497 Taunton saw thousands of gaunt Cornishmen marching  on to London to protest against the king's subsidy, and they aroused  the sympathy of the kind-hearted Somerset folk, who fed them, and were  afterwards fined for \"aiding and comforting\" them. Again, crowds of  Cornishmen here flocked to the standard of Perkin Warbeck. The gallant  defence of Taunton by Robert Blake, aided by the townsfolk, against  the whole force of the Royalists, is a matter of history, and also the  rebellion of Monmouth, who made Taunton his head-quarters. This  castle, like every other one in England, has much to tell us of the  chief events in our national annals.      [21] _Taunton and its Castle_, by D.P. Alford (Memorials of Old    Somerset), p. 149.    In the principality of Wales we find many noted strong holds--Conway,  Harlech, and many others. Carnarvon Castle, the repair of which is  being undertaken by Sir John Puleston, has no rival among our medieval  fortresses for the grandeur and extent of the ruins. It was commenced  about 1283 by Edward I, but took forty years to complete. In 1295 a  playful North Walian, named Madoc, who was an illegitimate son of  Prince David, took the rising stronghold by surprise upon a fair day,  massacred the entire garrison, and hanged the constable from his own  half-finished walls. Sir John Puleston, the present constable, though  he derives his patronymic from the \"base, bloody, and brutal Saxon,\"  is really a warmly patriotic Welshman, and is doing a good work in  preserving the ruins of the fortress of which he is the titular  governor.    We should like to record the romantic stories that have woven  themselves around each crumbling keep and bailey-court, to see them in  the days of their glory when warders kept the gate and watching  archers guarded the wall, and the lord and lady and their knights and  esquires dined in the great hall, and knights practised feats of arms  in the tilting-ground, and the banner of the lord waved over the  battlements, and everything was ready for war or sport, hunting or  hawking. But all the glories of most of the castles of England have  vanished, and naught is to be seen but ruined walls and deserted  halls. Some few have survived and become royal palaces or noblemen's  mansions. Such are Windsor, Warwick, Raby, Alnwick, and Arundel, but  the fate of most of them is very similar. The old fortress aimed at  being impregnable in the days of bows and arrows; but the progress of  guns and artillery somewhat changed the ideas with regard to their  security. In the struggle between Yorkists and Lancastrians many a  noble owner lost his castle and his head. Edward IV thinned down  castle-ownership, and many a fine fortress was left to die. When the  Spaniards threatened our shores those who possessed castles tried to  adapt them for the use of artillery, and when the Civil War began many  of them were strengthened and fortified and often made gallant  defences against their enemies, such as Donnington, Colchester,  Scarborough, and Pontefract. When the Civil War ended the last bugle  sounded the signal for their destruction. Orders were issued for their  destruction, lest they should ever again be thorns in the sides of the  Parliamentary army. Sometimes they were destroyed for revenge, or  because of their materials, which were sold for the benefit of the  Government or for the satisfaction of private greed. Lead was torn  from the roofs of chapels and banqueting-halls. The massive walls were  so strong that they resisted to the last and had to be demolished  with the aid of gunpowder. They became convenient quarries for stone  and furnished many a farm, cottage and manor-house with materials for  their construction. Henceforth the old castle became a ruin. In its  silent marshy moat reeds and rushes grow, and ivy covers its walls,  and trees have sprung up in the quiet and deserted courts. Picnic  parties encamp on the green sward, and excursionists amuse themselves  in strolling along the walls and wonder why they were built so thick,  and imagine that the castle was always a ruin erected for the  amusement of the cheap-tripper for jest and playground. Happily care  is usually bestowed upon the relics that remain, and diligent  antiquaries excavate and try to rear in imagination the stately  buildings. Some have been fortunate enough to become museums, and some  modernized and restored are private residences. The English castle  recalls some of the most eventful scenes in English history, and its  bones and skeleton should be treated with respect and veneration as an  important feature of vanishing England.    [Illustration: Knightly Bascinet (_temp._ Henry V) in Norwich Castle]          CHAPTER VI    VANISHING OR VANISHED CHURCHES      No buildings have suffered more than our parish churches in the course  of ages. Many have vanished entirely. A few stones or ruins mark the  site of others, and iconoclasm has left such enduring marks on the  fabric of many that remain that it is difficult to read their story  and history. A volume, several volumes, would be needed to record all  the vandalism that has been done to our ecclesiastical structures in  the ages that have passed. We can only be thankful that some churches  have survived to proclaim the glories of English architecture and the  skill of our masons and artificers who wrought so well and worthily in  olden days.

Phil, of course, could say nothing to Corker, for he knew it would be  hopeless. And Acton knew that Phil's pride could never bear the idea of  Jack--a Bourne--being expelled from the old place. Therefore he would  keep silence. I don't think I used the wrong adjective when I said it  was subtle. The only question was--could he so manage that Jack would  go? And Acton for good reasons was pretty certain that he could.    Jack was staidly taking a turn up and down the pavement with Grim when,  on passing by Biffen's house, he heard a whistle from one of the  windows, and, on looking up, he saw Acton.    \"I want you, Bourne, for five minutes--if you can spare them.\"    \"Of course he can,\" said Grim, _sotto voce_. \"Aren't you a monitor?  Jack, my boy, Acton wants to knight you--or something. You'll find his  boots in the bottom cupboard, if you want to black 'em very much. I  suppose, being only a common or garden fag, my feelings aren't to be  considered for a moment. When you were--for once--talking sensibly for a  Corker fag, you are called away to----\"    \"Cork all that frivol, old man, till you see me at tea,\" said Jack,  moving into Biffen's yard.    When Jack was comfortably installed in a chair, Acton bolted his door,  and, somewhat to young Bourne's surprise, seemed rather in a fix how to  start what he had to say. The locking of the door was unusual, and this,  combined with Acton's grave face and hesitating manner, made Jack a  trifle uneasy. Whatever was coming?    \"I say, Bourne,\" at last said his friend, \"do you know anything about  betting?\"    \"Betting!\" said Jack, with a vivid blush. \"About as much as most of the  fellows know of it. Not more.\"    \"Well, do you mind reading this?\" He handed Jack a slip of paper which  contained such cryptic sentences as: \"Grape Shot gone wrong, though he  will run. Pocket Book is the tip. If you're on Grape Shot, hedge on best  terms you can get,\" etc.    \"I understand that,\" said Jack, \"you've--if this means you--you've  backed the wrong horse.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Acton. \"I backed Grape Shot for the Lincolnshire  Handicap, and he hasn't a ghost of a chance now. Gone wrong.\"    \"I see,\" said Jack, absolutely staggered that Acton, a monitor, should  tell him, a fag, that he was betting on horse-racing.    \"I see, young 'un, that you seem surprised at my little flutter, but, by  Jove! this will have to be my last. Do you know, Bourne, I'm in an awful  hole.\"    \"I'm very sorry to hear it,\" said Jack, with no end of concern.    \"You see, if Pocket Book pulls the handicap off before I've time to trim  my sails, I lose a lot.\"    \"Much,\" said Jack, \"_for you?_\"    \"Thirty pounds.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Bourne.    \"I get a good allowance from home, Bourne, but I'm bound to say thirty  pounds would cripple me.\"    \"Rather,\" said Jack, with a gasp.    \"Of course, if the worst did come to the worst, I'd have to apply to  home; but there would be, as you might guess, no end of a row about it.\"    \"Then you must hedge,\" said Jack.    \"That is it, exactly. I must back Pocket Book for first place. This is a  sure tip--I can depend upon it.\"    \"Then send to the fellow you bet with, and let him put you on Pocket  Book.\"    \"That is just it, Jack--the bookmaker wouldn't take a bet from me.\"    \"Why ever not?\" said Jack, mystified.    \"Because I'm a minor--I'm under age.\"    \"Then how do you manage?\" said Jack.    \"Why, I bet through another man.\"    \"I see,\" said Jack, for this was but another edition of his own little  adventures. \"And that man----\"    \"Is Raffles,\" said Acton, quietly.    Jack bounced out of his chair as if he had been stung. \"That beast!\" he  gasped.    \"Raffles?\" said Acton, with a slow smile. \"I didn't know he was a  beast.\"    \"He is the meanest skunk alive,\" said Jack. He added fervently, \"Acton,  have no dealings with that fellow. He is an abominable sharper.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Acton, with a slight grimace at Jack's advice. \"But, all  the same, I have to deal through Raffles.\"    \"Then write to the fellow.\"    \"I don't know--I've forgotten his address.\"    \"Well, I'm hanged if I understand it!\" said Jack, lost in astonishment.  \"If you don't know it, and your bookmaker will only bet through Raffles,  you are in a hole--a marvellously deep one.\"    \"There's only one way out--find Raffles.\"    \"And that you can't do.\"    \"And that I think I can do by going to London.\"    \"Well, we're off for the holidays on Tuesday, and you can find Raffles  then.\"    \"I should be hopelessly too late if I waited till then. It would be  almost ruinous to be put on to Pocket Book in a day's time. I must hedge  to-night.\"    \"To-night?\" said Jack, in a complete fog. \"And you haven't found  Raffles!\"    \"No, but I think I know where to find him to-night. You know the Coon is  having a match with the Battersea Beauty at the Universal Sporting Club,  and Raffles is pretty sure to be there, and I must see him then.\"    \"But that means going to London, Acton.\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"And Corker would expel you--even you.\"    \"Without a doubt--if he finds out.\"    \"There's a chance that he may.\"    \"Certainly, but it's a mighty slender one, and in any case I mean to--I  _must_--risk it.\"    \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"    \"Now, Jack, I want you to listen to me,\" said Acton, very gravely, and  his voice showed his genuine anxiety. \"The Coon's match does not  commence until eleven o'clock at night, because an awful lot of the  Universal Sporters are actors and they cannot get away before that time  at earliest. Now, there are two entrances for the members into the club,  one in Pelican Street and the other in Ridge Street. Raffles must enter  by one or the other, and there must be some one at each doorway to give  him my note. I can take the one, and the question is--who will take the  second doorway?\"    \"Not I, Acton,\" said Jack, in a blue funk. \"Please, Acton, don't ask  me.\"    \"Jack, believe me, you were the last person I wanted to ask. I would  have asked Worcester or Chalmers if it had been any good, but they would  not know Raffles from Adam. It is ten thousand pities, but you are the  only fellow who knows Raffles here. No one else has ever set eyes on  him.\"    \"Acton, it means expulsion,\" said Jack, hoarsely.    \"Certainly for me if I'm caught, but, of course, I've no idea of being  caught. Jack, I'm not going to ask you to come with me. I shall think no  worse of you if you say you won't come, and I cannot take advantage  over you to force you against your own wish, because I lent you money.  Don't think so meanly of me.\"    \"Acton,\" said Jack, sweating drops of terror, \"it _is_ expulsion if  we're caught.\"    \"Jack,\" said Acton, \"have you ever known me to fail yet in anything I  undertake?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, I _will_ not fail here. If you like I'll give you my word of  honour we shall not be caught, and, if by a miracle of ill-luck we  should be, I shall see you through. I'll take every iota of blame on my  own shoulders. You'll find yourself captain of the school one day yet.\"    \"If I were expelled, Acton,\" said Jack, with intense conviction, \"the  pater would kill me first, and die himself afterwards; and as for  Phil----\"    \"Jack,\" said Acton, \"I must see the business through myself. You can't  do it, I see. I must lose the L30.\"    Jack got up and walked up and down the room in agony.    For five minutes Acton watched his wretched prey torn to pieces by his  conflicting fears--his shame of leaving Acton in the lurch, and his  dread of discovery.    \"Acton,\" said Jack at length, \"I can't leave you in the lurch. I'll go  with you to London.\"    Acton clasped Jack's hand, and said, \"Jack, you are a brick. I can only  say I thank you.\" He had landed his fish, as he knew he would.    Half an hour afterwards Jack said, almost cheerfully, for Acton had  been doing his best to smooth poor Bourne's ruffled feathers--    \"But how are we to go to town?\"    \"I've got a plan,\" said Acton; \"but I must turn it over in my mind  first. If you'll look in, young 'un, after tea, I'll tell you how we do  it. I'm going to see about it now. Once again, Jack, I thank you. You do  stand by a fellow when he's down on his luck.\"    Acton and Jack went out--the monitor to make arrangements for the  escapade, and Jack to Grim's quarters, where he was due for tea, which  he demolished with comparative cheerfulness, for Jack's confidence in  Acton was illimitable. After he had taken the jump he was not--is not  now--the kind of boy to look back.    At six young Bourne left his friend Grim among a waste of empty teacups,  plates, and jam-pots, and went to Acton's room.    \"I've arranged all,\" said that worthy. \"I've seen the proprietor of the  hotel down at Bring, and he's going to have a smart dog-cart and a  smarter horse to do the dozen miles between here and Charing Cross ready  for us at nine. He says we shall be rattled into town within the hour.  So if we aren't in time to spot Raffles we are down on our luck with a  vengeance. Your room is on the ground floor, isn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"overlooking Corker's flowerbeds.\"    \"Well, pull up the window after supper as quietly as you can, and slip  into the garden. Then scoot through the field, and you'll find me  waiting for you in the hotel stables. You can pass the word to your  chums in Corker's that you aren't going to be on show after supper, and  then they won't be routing you out.\"    \"My chums are mostly in Biffen's,\" said Jack. \"Grim and Rogers, etc.\"    \"Good omen,\" said Acton. \"Leave your window so that you can easily shove  it up when you come back, and leave your school cap behind, and bring a  tweed instead. Got such an article?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How's your room lighted?\"    \"Oh, we have the electric. It is switched off at ten, so that the light  will not give any trouble, Acton.\"    \"Well, bolt your door, too."]]]
