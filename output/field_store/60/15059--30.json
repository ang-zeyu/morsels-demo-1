Passage of the Ordinance of 1787.--What should be done with  the lands which in this way had come into the possession of the people  of all the states? It was quite impossible to divide these lands among  the people of the thirteen states. They never could have agreed as to  the amount due to each state. In 1785 Congress took the first step. It  passed a law or an ordinance for the government of the Territory  Northwest of the Ohio River. This ordinance was imperfect, and few  persons emigrated to the West. There were many persons who wished to  emigrate from the old states to the new region. But they were unwilling  to go unless they felt sure that they would not be treated by Congress  as the British government had treated the people of the original states.  Dr. Cutler of Massachusetts laid these matters before Congress and did  his work so well that Congress passed a new ordinance. This was in 1787.  The ordinance is therefore called the Ordinance of 1787. It was so well  suited to its purpose that nearly all the territories of the United  States have been settled and governed under its provisions. It will be  well to study this great document more at length.    [Sidenote: Provisions of the Ordinance of 1787.]    177. The Ordinance of 1787.--In the first place the ordinance  provided for the formation of one territory to be called the Territory  Northwest of the Ohio. But it is more often called the Northwest  Territory or simply the Old Northwest. At first it was to be governed by  the persons appointed by Congress. But it was further provided that when  settlers should arrive in sufficient numbers they should enjoy  self-government. When fully settled the territory should be divided into  five states. These should be admitted to the Confederation on a footing  of equality with the original states. The settlers in the territory  should enjoy full rights of citizenship. Education should be encouraged.  Slavery should never be permitted. This last provision is especially  important as it saved the Northwest to freedom. In this way a new  political organization was invented. It was called a territory. It was  really a colony; but it differed from all other colonies because in time  it would become a state on a footing of entire equality with the  parent states.

Necessity for a New Government.--At this very moment a  convention was making a constitution to put an end to the Confederation  itself. It was quite clear that something must be done or the states  soon would be fighting one another. Attempt after attempt had been made  to amend the Articles of Confederation so as to give Congress more  power. But every attempt had failed because the consent of every state  was required to amend the Articles. And one state or another had  objected to every amendment that had been proposed. It was while affairs  were in this condition that the Federal Convention met at Philadelphia  in May, 1787.    [Sidenote: James Madison.]    179. James Madison.--Of all the members of the Convention, James  Madison of Virginia best deserves the title of Father of the  Constitution. He drew up the Virginia plan which was adopted as the  basis of the new Constitution. He spoke convincingly for the plan in the  Convention. He did more than any one else to secure the ratification of  the Constitution by Virginia. He kept a careful set of _Notes_ of the  debates of the Convention which show us precisely how the Constitution  was made. With Alexander Hamilton and John Jay he wrote a series of  papers which is called the _Federalist_ and is still the best guide to  the Constitution.    [Illustration: JAMES MADISON.]    [Sidenote: Washington President of the Convention.]    [Sidenote: Franklin.]    180. Other Fathers of the Constitution.--George Washington was  chosen President of the Convention. He made few speeches. But the  speeches that he made were very important. And the mere fact that he  approved the Constitution had a tremendous influence throughout the  country. The oldest man in the Convention was Benjamin Franklin. His  long experience in politics and in diplomacy with his natural shrewdness  had made him an unrivaled manager of men. From all the states came able  men. In fact, with the exception of John Adams, Samuel Adams, Patrick  Henry, and Thomas Jefferson, the strongest men in political life were in  the Federal Convention. Never in the history of the world have so many  great political leaders, learned students of politics, and shrewd  business men gathered together. The result of their labors was the most  marvelous product of political wisdom that the world has ever seen.    [Illustration: THE OLD STATE HOUSE, PHILADELPHIA.

Plans for a National Government.--As soon as the Convention  was in working order, Governor Randolph of Virginia presented Madison's  plan for a \"national\" government. Charles Pinckney of South Carolina  also brought forward a plan. His scheme was more detailed than was  Madison's plan. But, like it, it provided for a government with \"supreme  legislative, executive, and judicial powers.\" On May 30 the Convention  voted that a \"national government ought to be established, consisting of  a supreme Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary.\" It next decided that  the legislative department should consist of two houses. But when the  delegates began to talk over the details, they began to disagree.    [Sidenote: The New Jersey plan.]    182. Disagreement as to Representation.--The Virginia plan proposed  that representation in one branch of the new Congress should be divided  among the states according to the amount of money each state paid into  the national treasury, or according to the number of the free  inhabitants of each state. The Delaware delegates at once said that they  must withdraw. In June Governor Patterson of New Jersey brought forward  a plan which had been drawn up by the delegates from the smaller states.  It is always called, however, the New Jersey plan. It proposed simply to  amend the Articles of Confederation so as to give Congress more power.  After a long debate the New Jersey plan was rejected.

The Compromise as to Representation.--The discussion now  turned on the question of representation in the two houses of Congress.  After a long debate and a good deal of excitement Benjamin Franklin  and Roger Sherman proposed a compromise. This was, that members of the  House of Representatives should be apportioned among the states  according to their population and should be elected directly by the  people. In the Senate they proposed that each state, regardless of size,  population, or wealth, should have two members. The Senators,  representing the states, would fittingly be chosen by the state  legislatures. It was agreed that the states should be equally  represented in the Senate. But it was difficult to reach a conclusion as  to the apportionment of representatives in the House.    [Sidenote: The federal ratio.]    184. Compromise as to Apportionment.--Should the members of the  House of Representatives be distributed among the states according to  population? At first sight the answer seemed to be perfectly clear. But  the real question was, should slaves who had no vote be counted as a  part of the population? It was finally agreed that the slaves should be  counted at three-fifths of their real number. This rule was called the  \"federal ratio.\" The result of this rule was to give the Southern slave  states representation in Congress out of all proportion to their voting  population.    [Sidenote: Power of Congress over commerce.]    [Sidenote: Restriction as to slave-trade.]    185. Compromise as to the Slave-Trade.--When the subject of the  powers to be given to Congress came to be discussed, there was even  greater excitement. The Northerners wanted Congress to have power to  regulate commerce. But the Southerners opposed it because they feared  Congress would use this power to put an end to the slave-trade. John  Rutledge of South Carolina even went so far as to say that unless this  question was settled in favor of the slaveholders, the slave states  would \"not be parties to the Union.\" In the end this matter also was  compromised by providing that Congress could not prohibit the  slave-trade until 1808. These were the three great compromises. But  there were compromises on so many smaller points that we cannot even  mention them here.

Franklin's Prophecy.--It was with a feeling of real relief  that the delegates finally came to the end of their labors. As they were  putting their names to the Constitution, Franklin pointed to a rising  sun that was painted on the wall behind the presiding officer's chair.  He said that painters often found it difficult to show the difference  between a rising sun and a setting sun. \"I have often and often,\" said  the old statesman, \"looked at that behind the President, without being  able to tell whether it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],[0,"Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#20)"],[1,"rille; first and second couples and sides join hands all round,  advance four steps, and retreat ditto. _L'Ete_ is now sometimes  introduced, the _grand rond_ being repeated between each division of  the figure. But it gives a greater variety and _brio_ to the quadrille  if, after the first _grand rond_, the following figure be performed,  the _galop_ step being used throughout. Each gentleman (at top and  bottom couples) takes his lady round the waist, as for the _galop_;  advance four steps, retreat ditto, advance again, cross to opposite  places; advance, retreat, re-cross to own places. Ladies chain; half  promenade across; half right and left to places; _grand rond_. Side  couples repeat figure. _Grand rond_ between each division and at the  conclusion. Bow to your partners, and conduct your lady to seat.           *       *       *       *       *    V.--THE CALEDONIANS.      This quadrille has, within the last few years become more fashionable  than formerly. But it is not so frequently danced as the Lancers,  still less as the First Set of Quadrilles. Each set can consist only  of eight couples, differing in this respect from the simple quadrille,  which admits of an indefinite number of couples.    _1st Figure_.--Top and opposite couples hands across; then back again;  _balancez_ and turn partners; _chaine des dames_; half promenade  across; half right and left to places.    _2nd Figure_.--Top gentleman advances and retreats twice. _Balancez_  to corners and turn, each lady passing to her next neighbour's place.  Having changed your partner, all promenade quite round. Second, third,  and fourth gentleman repeat same figure; thus all have regained their  places.    _3rd Figure_.--Top lady and _vis-a-vis_ gentleman advance and retreat  twice.    Top couple join hands and cross over; opposite couple cross likewise,  separately, allowing top couple to pass between them; then top couple  re-cross to places separately, leaving the second couple (who re-cross  with joined hands) inside.    _Balancez_ to corners and turn your neighbour's partner; back to  places. All four couples, joining hands in circle, advance and retreat  twice. Same figure repeated by second and side couples.    _4th Figure_.--Top lady and _vis-a-vis_ gentleman advance four steps;  second lady and her _vis-a-vis_ then do the same; each couple turns  partner back to places. Ladies in all four couples move four steps to  the right, each taking her neighbour's place; gentlemen then move four  steps to the left, each into next neighbour's place. Ladies again to  the right; gentlemen again to the left. Promenade round, turn partners  to places. Second and side couples repeat in succession.    _5th Figure_.--First couple promenade round inside the quadrille. Four  ladies advance, courtesy to each other, and retire; four gentlemen  advance, bow, and retire. _Balancez_ and turn partners. Grand chain  half way round. All promenade to places, and turn partners. All  _chassez croisez_, ladies right, gentlemen left (behind their  partners), and back again to places. Second and side couples repeat as  before. Promenade all round for _finale_.           *       *       *       *       *    VI.--THE LANCERS.      The Lancers Quadrille is perhaps the most graceful and animated of  any. Within the last few years it has become a great favourite in  fashionable circles, probably owing to its revival at the state balls  of Her Majesty. It admits of much skill and elegance in executing  its quick and varied figures, a correct acquaintance with which is  absolutely requisite to all who take part in it. Unlike the common  quadrille, the Lancers must be danced by four couples only in each  set; though of course there can be many sets dancing at the same time.  The number being so limited, one awkward or ignorant person confuses  the whole set; therefore, it is indispensable that every one who  dances in this quadrille should have a thorough mastery of its  graceful intricacies. We have observed that of late it has become the  fashion to substitute new tunes for the old well-known music of the  Lancers Quadrille. We cannot consider this an improvement. The  old simple melodies are peculiarly fitted to the sprightly, joyous  character of the dance; which is more than can be said for any of the  modern substitutes. When these are used, the Lancers, in our opinion,  loses its individuality and spirit, becoming almost like a common  quadrille. We should be heartily glad to see the old tunes restored  once for all to their rightful supremacy.    The sets of four couples, top, opposite and sides, having been  arranged, the dance begins as follows:--_1st Figure_.--First lady and  opposite gentleman advance and retreat; advance again, joining their  hands; pass round each other and back to places. (1st eight bars.)  Top couple join hands, and cross, opposite couple crossing at the same  time, separately, outside them; the same reversed, back to places.  (2nd eight bars.) All the couples _balancez_ to corners; each  gentleman turns his neighbour's partner back to places. (3rd eight  bars.) Second couple repeat figure from beginning; after them side  couples, those who stand to the right of top couple having always the  priority, as in the common quadrille.    _2nd Figure_.--First couple advance and retreat, gentleman holding  lady's left hand; advance again; gentleman leaves his partner in  the centre of the quadrille, and retires to place. (1st eight bars.)  _Balancez_ to each other and turn to places. (2nd eight bars.) Side  couples join first and second couples, forming a line of four on  either side. Each line advances four steps, retreats ditto; then  advances again, each gentleman reclaiming his partner, and all turn to  places. Second and side couples repeat figure in succession.    _3rd Figure_.--First lady advances four steps alone, and stops;  _vis-a-vis_ gentleman does the same; first lady retires, facing  gentleman, to whom she makes a slow profound courtesy. (The courtesy  must occupy a bar or two of the music; and as, if made with grace and  dignity, it is most effective, we would recommend ladies to practise  it carefully beforehand.) The gentleman at the same time bows and  retires. (1st eight bars.) All four ladies advance to centre, give  right hands across to each other (which is called the _double chain_),  and left hand to _vis-a-vis_ gentleman; then back again, left hands  across in the middle, and right hands to partners, back to places.  (2nd eight bars.) Second and side couples repeat figure from  commencement.    A more recent fashion for dancing this figure is as follows:--Instead  of one lady advancing at first, all four advance, and courtesy to  each other; then turn and courtesy to their partners. Ladies do the  _moulinet_ in the centre; that is, give right hands across to each  other, and half round; left hands back again, and return to places.  Gentlemen meantime all move round outside the ladies, till each has  regained his place. Figure, as usual, repeated four times; but the  second and fourth time the gentlemen advance instead of the ladies,  and bow, first to each other, then to their partners; continuing as  before through the rest of the figure.    _4th Figure_.--Top gentleman, taking partner's left hand, leads her  to the couple on their right, to whom they bow and courtesy (which  civility must be met with the like acknowledgment), then cross quickly  to fourth couple, and do the same, (1st eight bars.) All four couples  _chassez croisez_ right and left (gentleman invariably passing behind  his partner) then turn hands (_tour des mains_) back to places. (2nd  eight bars.) First and opposite couples right and left across and back  again to places. (3rd eight bars.) Second and sides repeat as usual.    _5th Figure_.--This figure commences with the music. Each couple  should stand ready, the gentleman facing his partner, his right hand  holding hers. If every one does not start directly the music begins,  and does not observe strict time throughout, this somewhat intricate  figure becomes hopelessly embarrassed; but, when well danced, it is  the prettiest of the set. It commences with the _grande chaine_  all round; each gentleman giving his right hand to his partner at  starting, his left to the next lady, then his right again, and so all  round, till all have returned to their places. (This occupies sixteen  bars of the music.) First couple promenade inside figure, returning to  places with their backs turned to opposite couple. The side couple  on their right falls in immediately behind them; the fourth couple  follows, the second couple remaining in their places. A double line is  thus formed--ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other. (3rd eight  bars.) All _chassez croisez_, ladies left, gentlemen right, behind  partners. First lady leads off, turning sharply round to the right;  first gentleman does the same to the left, meeting at the bottom of  the quadrille, and promenade back to places. All the ladies follow  first lady; all the gentlemen follow first gentleman; and as each  meets his partner at the bottom of the figure, they touch hands,  then fall back in two lines--ladies on one side, gentlemen on the  other--facing each other. (4th eight bars.) Four ladies join hands,  advance and retreat; four gentlemen ditto at the same time; then each  turns his partner to places. (5th eight bars.) _Grande chaine_ again.  Second and side couples repeat the whole figure in succession, each  couple taking its turn to lead off, as the first had done. _Grande  chaine_ between each figure and in conclusion.           *       *       *       *       *    VII.--THE LANCERS FOR SIXTEEN, OR DOUBLE LANCERS.      _1st figure_.--Two first ladies and _vis-a-vis_ gentlemen begin at  the same moment, and go through the figure as in Single Lancers. All  _balancez_ to corners; in other words, each lady sets to gentleman at  her right,"]]]
