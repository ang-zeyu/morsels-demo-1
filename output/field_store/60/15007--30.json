When the wind  dropped, what was left was against them, and the Endeavour would only go  with the tide, so Cook took a run ashore to the west side of the bay, but  saw nothing of interest, and concluded it was but sparsely inhabited.  Whilst he was away natives went off to trade and behaved remarkably well,  with the exception of one man who was caught making off with the  half-hour glass, so Mr. Hicks had him triced up, and he was given a dozen  lashes. When it was explained to his friends why this was done, they  expressed their approval, and on his release an old man gave him another  thrashing.    The weather now became very unsettled, and they were not able to keep as  near the coast as they desired, but on 26th November some cultivated  spots were seen, and several canoes came off.    \"Some of the natives ventur'd on board; to two, who appeared to be  chiefs, I gave presents. After these were gone out of the ship, the  others became so Troublesome that in order to get rid of them, we were at  the expense of two or three Musquet Balls and one 4 pound shott, but as  no harm was intended them, none they received, unless they happened to  overheat themselves in pulling ashore.\"    A STAMPEDE.    To the west side of Cape Brett is a deep bay which was seen but not  named, and here the town of Russell is now established, said to possess  one of the finest harbours in the world, into which vessels of any  draught can enter in all weathers and at any state of the tide. The  natives were found difficult to deal with, and \"would cheat whenever they  had an opportunity.\" The ship left its anchorage, but was after a time  driven back again, and Cook, with a party, took the opportunity to land.  They were followed up by the Maoris, and were soon surrounded by about  two hundred of them, some of whom tried to seize the boats, but being  driven off tried to break in on the party. Several charges of small shot,  which did no serious damage, were fired into them, and then the ship  fired a 4 pounder over them, which caused a stampede, and during the rest  of the stay there was no further trouble, but Cook had to punish three of  his own men for stealing potatoes from one of the plantations. He  invariably tried to hold the balance fairly between his men and the  natives.    The country is described as very similar to that seen before, but the  number of inhabitants was greater, and though apparently not under the  same chiefs, they were on good terms with each other, and inclined to be  civil to their visitors. A good deal of the ground was under cultivation,  producing good sweet-potatoes. A few trees of the paper-mulberry were  seen, from which the natives made a cloth in a similar manner to the  Otaheitans, but the quantity was so small that it was only used for  ornament. Tupia, who had been instructed to gain as much information  about the people as he could, was informed that some of their ancestors  once went off in large canoes and discovered a country to the north-west  after a passage of about a month, only a small number returning. These  reported they had been to a place where the people ate hogs, using the  same word for the animal as the Otaheitans, Tupia asked if they had any  in New Zealand, and the reply was \"no.\" He asked if their ancestors  brought any back, again the answer was \"no\"; whereon he told them their  story must be a lie, for their ancestors could never have been such fools  as to come back without some. The land said to have been discovered may  have been New Caledonia.    One of the men who had been wounded at the first coming of the ship was  seen by Banks. A ball had gone through his arm and grazed his chest. He  did not seem to have any pain, and the wound though exposed to the air,  was perfectly healthy, and he was greatly pleased to receive a musket  ball like the one which had wounded him.    When leaving the bay they nearly grounded, being set by the current  towards a small island, but the boats towed them clear. Very soon after  they struck on an unseen rock, which was named Whale Rock, but almost  immediately got clear, with no \"perceptible damage,\" into twenty fathoms.    BLOWN OFF THE LAND.    Progress was now very slow, owing either to want of, or adverse wind. On  10th December they discovered two bays separated by a low neck of land,  Knuckle Point; one bay was named Doubtless Bay and the other Sandy Bay;  the country is described as nothing but irregular white sandhills, and  Cook concluded from its appearance that the island was here very narrow  and exposed to the open sea on the west. This he soon proved to be  correct. Foster, in his account of the Second Voyage, says that when the  Endeavour was passing Doubtless Bay, M. de Surville was anchored under  the land, in the Saint Jean Baptiste, and saw Cook's ship, though himself  unseen. In the account of De Surville's voyage, published by the Academie  Francaise, it is stated that New Zealand was not sighted till 12th  December 1769, and owing to bad weather no anchorage was gained till  17th. No mention whatever is made of the Endeavour being sighted, and M.  l'Abbe Rochon, the editor, thinks it most probable that neither navigator  knew anything of the movements of the other. De Surville mentions having  lost anchors in a place he calls Double Bay, during a storm \"ABOUT 22nd  December,\" and it may possibly have been the one Cook encountered on the  28th off the north end of the island. They were blown out of sight of  land on the 13th, the main topsail being split, and next day both fore  and mizzen topsails were lost, but they managed to bring up under shelter  of a small island off Knuckle Point. On the 15th the latitude was found  to be 34 degrees 6 minutes South, with land visible to the south-west,  and a large swell was coming from the west, so Cook concluded this was  the most northerly point of the island, and named it North Cape.    After beating about for some days against westerly winds, they ran up  north, returning southwards 23rd December, and the following day sighted  land to the south-east, which proved to be Tasman's Three Kings. Here  Banks provided the Christmas dinner, shooting several solan geese, which  were made into a pie, and were \"eaten with great approbation; and in the  evening all hands were as drunk as our forefathers used to be upon like  occasions.\"    On the 27th, when about thirty leagues west of North Cape, and about the  same latitude as the Bay of Islands, no land in sight, the wind rose so  that they had to bring to, under the mainsail, but moderated a little the  next day so that they could run in towards the land. Again it freshened  up and blew a perfect hurricane, accompanied by heavy rain, and a  \"prodidgeous high sea,\" which caused the ship to go greatly to leeward.  On the 30th, Cape Maria van Diemen was seen about six leagues off, the  land extending east and south. On the last day of the year their position  was given as \"34 degrees 42 minutes South, Cape Maria van Diemen  North-East by North about 5 leagues.\" Cook says:    \"I cannot help thinking but what it will appear a little strange that, at  this season of the year, we should be three weeks in getting fifty  leagues, for so long is it since we pass'd Cape Brett; but it will hardly  be credited that in the midst of summer and in the latitude of 35 degrees  South such a gale of wind as we have had could have happened, which for  its strength and continuance was such as I hardly was ever in before.  Fortunately at this time we were a good distance from land, otherwise it  would have proved fatal to us.\"    VEGETABLE SHEEP.    On 2nd January 1770 Cook fixed the position of Cape Maria van Diemen,  giving it as 34 degrees 30 minutes South, 187 degrees 18 minutes West of  Greenwich. Admiral Wharton remarks that this is extraordinarily correct,  seeing that the ship was never close to the Cape, and the observations  were all taken in very bad weather. The latitude is exact, and the  longitude only three miles out. He missed seeing Kaipara Harbour, one of  the few good ones on the west coast, and describes the land as having a  most desolate and inhospitable appearance, nothing but sandhills with  hardly a sign of vegetation on them, and says: \"If we was once clear of  it, I am determined not to come so near again if I can avoid it, unless  we have a very favourable wind indeed.\" On the 11th, a high mountain, its  summit covered with snow, was seen, and named Mount Egmont; Wharton gives  its height as 8,300 feet, and describes it as a magnificent conical  mountain surrounded on three sides by the sea. Banks notes on the sides  of the hill \"many white lumps in companies which bore much resemblance to  flocks of sheep.\" These were a peculiar plant, Raoulia mammillaris  (Hooker), known in New Zealand as vegetable sheep. Fires were seen, the  first sign of inhabitants on the west coast.    On the 14th, thinking he was in the entrance of a large bay, Cook ran in  under the southern coast, and finding it broken into promising-looking  bays, determined to run into one and careen the ship, as she was very  foul; it is now called Ship Cove, in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Here they  were at once visited by canoes, whose fully armed occupants commenced  acquaintance by \"heaving a few stones against the ship.\" Tupia opened a  conversation, and a few ventured on board, but did not make a long stay.  Cook then landed to look for water, and soon found an excellent supply,  and \"as to wood the land is here an entire forest.\" Whilst he was away,  the crew got out the nets, and caught about 300 pounds of fish. Some  natives also came off with fish, and though it was not good, Cook ordered  it to be bought, in order to open up trade with them. However, they soon  found these people were inclined to be quarrelsome and threatening, and  as the ship was in an awkward position, being already"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#20)"],[1,"worked hard, but with evidently  increasing dissatisfaction. He clung persistently to his acquired  tendency to choose the end boxes, and after each trial he returned less  willingly to the starting point. Up to this time his attitude toward the  experimenter had been perfectly friendly, if not wholly trustful. But  when on July 21 he was brought into the apparatus for the second series,  he exhibited a wholly new form of behavior, for instead of attending  diligently to the open doors and devoting his energies to trying to find  the right box, he instead, after gazing at them for a few seconds,  turned toward the experimenter and jumped for him savagely, throwing  himself against the wire netting with great force. This was repeated a  number of times during the first two or three trials, and it occurred  less frequently later in the series. Since nothing unusual had happened  outside of the experiment room, the suggested explanation of this sudden  change in attitude and behavior is that the monkey resented and blamed  on the experimenter the difficulty which he was having in obtaining  food.    From this time on until the end of my work, Sobke was always savage and  both in and out of the apparatus he was constantly on the watch for an  opportunity to spring upon me. Previously, it had been possible for me  to coax him into the apparatus by offering him food and to return him to  his cage by walking after him. But on and after the twenty-first of  July, it was impossible for me to approach him without extreme risk of  being bitten.    Doctor Hamilton when told of this behavior, reported that several times  monkeys have shown resentment toward him when they were having trouble  in the experiment. I therefore feel fairly confident that I have not  misinterpreted Sobke's behavior. When on July 22 I gave Sobke an  opportunity to enter the apparatus, he refused, and it was impossible to  lure him in with food. Two hours later, having waited meantime for his  breakfast, he entered readily and worked steadily and persistently  through his third series of trials, but in no one of these trials did he  choose correctly. Neither on this day nor the following did he exhibit  resentment while at work. He apparently had regained his affective poise  and was able to attend as formerly to the task of locating his rewards.    During these first three series, although the ratio of right to wrong  choices stood 0 to 10, there occurred a marked reduction in the number  of trials in which aid was necessary as well as in the total number of  choices, and on July 23 correct reactions began to appear. Improvement  during the next hundred trials was steady and fairly rapid, and on July  31, a record of seven right to three wrong trials was obtained. This was  surprising to the experimenter, as well as gratifying, since he was  eager to have the animal complete this problem before work should have  to be discontinued.    Everything went smoothly until August 2, when my assistant, who had been  left in charge of the experimental work for a week, attempted to  increase the number of trials per day to two series. Sobke apparently  was not quite ready for this increase in the amount of his day's labor  and refused to work at the end of the first series. In this series he  did less well than on the previous day. The following day, August 3,  unfortunately and contrary to the wishes of the experimenter, the  laboratory was painted and there was necessarily considerable  disturbance because of the presence of the workmen, and in addition, the  pervasive odor of fresh paint. Sobke chose still less successfully on  this date, and on August 4, he refused to work after the eighth trial.  It is true that during these bad days the total number of choices  steadily diminished while the successes, also, diminished, or at best,  failed to increase. When on August 9, I returned to the laboratory to  take charge, I found that Sobke was no longer trying to solve the  problem as when I had gone away. His attitude had changed in that he had  become indifferent, careless, and obviously discouraged with his task.
