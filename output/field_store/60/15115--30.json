Further physical  activity is useful in exercising the voluntary muscles, and thus  opposing the invasion by interstitial fat of the muscle fibrils. Extreme  exercise also, to a certain degree, exerts a favorable influence on the  cardiac muscle, augmenting both its nutrition and its capacity for  labor. With the anaemic obese, however, it is necessary to be most  circumspect in prescribing forced exercise; also with the elderly obese  possessed of enfeebled or fatty heart.    Hydrotherapy, especially in the form of cold douches, particularly when  combined with massage, is often of considerable value in relieving  obesity; the method of Harmman, of St. Germain, which has in many  instances induced rapid loss of adipose, is of this class. Tepid saline  baths and vapor baths have many advocates, and may afford material aid  when the heart and circulation do not inhibit their employment. Hot  baths elevate the temperature of the body and increase the organic  exchanges, hence, as Bert and Reynard have pointed out, tend to the  elimination of oxygen and carbonic acid; but when employed, the patient  should be introduced while the temperature is below 130 deg. F., when it may  be gradually raised in the course of thirty or forty minutes to 140 deg. F.    It has already been intimated, the chief feature of the treatment of  obesity is acceleration of the exchanges; and this is in the main true,  though it must also be borne in mind that, while there are obese who  excrete little urea and have a depressed central nervous temperature,  many may be azoturic, and besides eliminate phosphate in excess, when an  oxidating treatment will not only fail, but prove positively injurious.    The bile throws out fat, therefore, to accelerate nutritive oxidations,  the liver and nervous system must be acted upon, _i.e._, stimulated.  Everything that tends to diminish the activity of the former, or depress  the latter, must be avoided. Hence intellectual labor should be  encouraged, or in lieu thereof, travel advised. Exercise should be taken  chiefly while fasting; the limits of sleep confined to strict necessity,  and _siestas_ after meals and during the day strictly forbidden; the  skin stimulated by hydro-therapeutic measures, including massage under  cold affusions, during warm salt baths, etc.    To increase the activity of the liver, salicylate of soda may often be  advantageously administered for its cholagogue effect; or resort may be  had to saline purgatives such as are afforded by the springs of  Marienbad, Kissengen, Homburg, Carlsbad, Brides, Hunyadi, or  Chatel-Guyon; and it is somewhat remarkable that while undergoing a  course of these waters, there is often no appreciable change in weight  or obesity, though the decrease becomes most marked almost immediately  upon cessation of treatment.    Everything tending to increased or fuller respiration is to be  encouraged, for the fats are thus supplied with oxygen, hastening their  disintegration and consumption.    Direct medicinal treatment presents no very wide scope. Bouchard  imagines lime water may be useful by accelerating nutrition, but this is  problematical, since fat in emulsion or in droplets does not burn.  Nevertheless, alkalies in general, alkaline carbonates, liquor potassa,  soaps, etc., aid in rendering fat more soluble, and consequently more  susceptible to attack. The alkaline waters, however, are much less  active in obesity than the saline mineral waters, unless, as sometimes  happens, there is a complication of diabetes and obesity.    Purgatives are always more or less useful, and often required to be  renewed with all the regularity of habit. Then too, the iodides,  especially iodide of sodium or potassium, as recommended by M. Germain  See, frequently prove of excellent service by aiding elimination and  facilitating the mutations.    According to Kisch, the cold mineral waters containing an abundance of  sulphate of soda, like Hunyadi and Marienbad, are to be preferred to the  hot mineral waters, such as Carlsbad, because of their lesser irritant  action on the vascular system, and because they strongly excite diuresis  through their low temperature and contained carbonic acid; Carlsbad  deserves preference only when obesity is combined with uric acid  calculi, or with diabetes. For very anaemic persons, however, the weak  alkaline and saline waters should be selected; or they should confine  themselves to chalybeate waters containing an excess of sulphate of  soda. Water containing sulphate of soda is also indicated as a beverage  where there are troubles of the circulatory apparatus; it is  contraindicated only in accentuated arterio-sclerosis.    As a matter of fact, I find the suggestion of M. Dujardin-Beaumetz,  that the obese should be divided into two groups, a most practical one,  for some are strong and vigorous--great eaters, perhaps even  gluttons--while others, on the contrary, are feeble and debilitated,  with flesh soft and flaccid; and upon the former may be imposed all the  rigors of the reducing system, while the latter must be dealt with more  carefully.    In general, it must be noted, the regimen prescribed for the obese is  insufficient, as the following table prepared by M.C. Paul abundantly  proves:        -------------------------+----------+----------+---------------             Author.           |Albuminous|  Fatty   |                               | Matters. | Matters. | Hydrocarbons.      -------------------------+----------+----------+---------------      Voit.                    |    118   |    40    |     150      Harvey-Banting.          |    170   |    10    |      80      Ebstein.                 |    100   |    85    |      50      Oertel.                  |  155-179 |  25-41   |    70-110      Kisch (plethoric).       |    160   |    10    |      80        \"   (anaemic).          |    200   |    12    |     100      Normal ration.           |    124   |    55    |     455      -------------------------+----------+----------+---------------    There is, therefore, as Dujardin-Beaumetz asserts, autophagia in the  obese, and all these varieties of treatment have but one end, viz.:  Reduction of the daily ration. But the quantity of nourishment should  not be too greatly curtailed, for, manifestly, if the fat disappears the  more surely, the muscles (rich in albumen) undergo too rapid  modification. It is progressive action that should always be sought.    The quantity of aliment may be reduced either by imposing an always  uniform regimen, which soon begets anorexia and disgust, or by  withholding from the food a considerable quantity of fat, or, finally,  by forbidding beverage during meals. Emaciation is obtained readily  enough in either way, and demands only the constant exercise of will  power on the part of the patient; but unhappily, severe regimen cannot  always be prescribed. When the obese patient has passed the age of  forty; when the heart suffers from degeneration; or when the heart is  anaemic--in all, rigorous treatment will serve to still further enfeeble  the central organ of circulation, and tend to precipitate accidents  that, by all means, are to be avoided. In such cases, by _not_ treating  the obesity, the days of the patient will be prolonged. In degeneration  of the heart, however, the method of Ebstein may be tried; and when  there is renal calculi and gouty diathesis, that of Germain See may  prove satisfactory.

[Illustration: SYLVAIN DORNON, THE STILT WALKER OF LANDES.]    Sylvain Dornon, the stilt walker of Landes, started from Paris on the  12th of last March for Moscow, and reached the end of his journey at the  end of a fifty-eight days' walk. This long journey upon stilts  constitutes a genuine curiosity, not only to the Russians, to whom this  sort of locomotion is unknown, but also to many Frenchmen.    Walking on stilts, in fact, which was common twenty years ago in certain  parts of France, is gradually tending to become a thing of the past. In  the wastes of Gascony it was formerly a means of locomotion adapted to  the nature of the country. The waste lands were then great level plains  covered with stunted bushes and dry heath. Moreover, on account of the  permeability of the subsoil, all the declivities were transformed into  marshes after the slightest fall of rain.    There were no roads of any kind, and the population, relying upon sheep  raising for a living, was much scattered. It was evidently in order to  be able to move around under these very peculiar conditions that the  shepherds devised and adopted stilts. The stilts of Landes are called,  in the language of the country, _tchangues_, which signifies \"big legs,\"  and those who use them are called _tchangues_. The stilts are pieces of  wood about five feet in length, provided with a shoulder and strap to  support the foot. The upper part of the wood is flattened and rests  against the leg, where it is held by a strong strap. The lower part,  that which rests upon the earth, is enlarged and is sometimes  strengthened with a sheep's bone. The Landese shepherd is provided with  a staff which he uses for numerous purposes, such as a point of support  for getting on to the stilts and as a crook for directing his flocks.  Again, being provided with a board, the staff constitutes a comfortable  seat adapted to the height of the stilts. Resting in this manner, the  shepherd seems to be upon a gigantic tripod. When he stops he knits or  he spins with the distaff thrust in his girdle. His usual costume  consists of a sort of jacket without sleeves, made of sheep skin, of  canvas gaiters, and of a drugget cloak."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#20)"],[1,"attached to  Mr. Wesley's interest, also says, \"I will be very candid with you and  tell you that I think the Baptist church is the church that will spread  the Gospel among the poor Negroes and I hope and trust, as there is  reason to believe that your church will be preferred before all others  by the Negroes, that those of you who are in affluence will contribute  and send out a minister and support him,\" &c.    --_Baptist Annual Register_, 1790-1793, pages 542-543.        FROM THE REV. ABRAHAM MARSHALL, WHO FORMED THE NEGRO CHURCH AT SAVANNAH,  TO MR. RIPPON      Kioka, Georgia, May 1, 1793.    _Rev. and Dear Sir_,    Yours came safe to hand, and gave singular satisfaction. Neither  spreading plains, nor rolling oceans, can prevent us from weeping with  those that weep, and rejoicing with those that rejoice. I have had it  in contemplation for some time to open a correspondence with our dear  friend on the other side of the flood, but my constant travelling has  hitherto prevented; I am highly pleased that you have opened the way....    As to the Black Church in Savannah, of which you had a particular  account by Mr. Clarke, I baptized forty-five of them in one day,  assisted in the constitution of the church, and ordination of the  minister. They have given repeated proofs, by their sufferings, of their  zeal for the cause of God and religion; and, I believe, are found in the  faith, and strict in discipline.    I am also intimately acquainted with Jessy Golfin; he lives thirty miles  below me, in South Carolina, and twelve miles below Augusta; he is a  negro servant to Mr. Golfin, who, to his praise be it spoken, treats him  with respect. His countenance is grave, his voice charming, his delivery  good, nor is he a novice in the mysteries of the kingdom.

A LETTER FROM THE NEGRO BAPTIST CHURCH IN SAVANNAH, ADDRESSED TO THE  REVEREND DOCTOR RIPPON      Savannah-Georgia, U.S.A., Dec. 23, 1800.    _My Dear and Reverend Brother_,    After a long silence occasioned by various hindrances, I sit down to  answer your inestimable favour by the late dear Mr. White, who I hope is  rejoicing, far above the troubles and trials of this frail sinful state.  All the books mentioned in your truly condescending and affectionate  letter, came safe, and were distributed according to your humane  directions. You can scarcely conceive, much less than I describe, the  gratitude excited by so seasonably and precious a supply of the means of  knowledge and grace, accompanied with benevolent proposals of further  assistance. Deign, dear sir, to accept our united and sincere thanks for  your great kindness to us, who have been so little accustomed to such  attentions. Be assured that our prayers have ascended, and I trust will  continue to ascend to God, for your health and happiness, and that you  may be rendered a lasting ornament to our holy Religion, and a  successful Minister of the Gospel.    With much pleasure, I inform you, dear sir, that I enjoy good health,  and am strong in body, tho' sixty-three years old, and am blessed with  a pious wife, whose freedom I have obtained, and an only daughter and  child who is married to a free man, tho' she, and consequently, under  our laws, her seven children, five sons and two daughters, are slaves.  By a kind Providence I am well provided for, as to worldly comforts,  (tho' I have had very little given me as a minister) having a house and  lot in this city, besides the land on which several buildings stand, for  which I receive a small rent, and a fifty-six acre tract of land, with  all necessary buildings, four miles in the country, and eight slaves;  for whose education and happiness, I am enabled thro' mercy to provide.    But what will be infinitely more interesting to my friend, and is so  much more prized by myself, we enjoy the rights of conscience to a  valuable extent, worshiping in our families and preaching three times  every Lord's-day, baptizing frequently from ten to thirty at a time in  the Savannah, and administering the sacred supper, not only without  molestation, but in the presence, and with the approbation and  encouragement of many of the white people. We are now about seven  hundred in number, and the work of the Lord goes on prosperously.    An event which has had a happy influence on our affairs was the coming  of Mr. Holcombe, late pastor of Euhaw Church, to this place at the call  of the heads of the city, of all denominations, who have remained for  the thirteen months he has been here among his constant hearers and his  liberal supporters. His salary is 2000 a year. He has just had a  baptistery, with convenient appendages, built in his place of worship,  and has commenced baptizing.    Another dispensation of Providence has much strengthened our hands, and  increased our means of information; Henry Francis, lately a slave to the  widow of the late Colonel Leroy Hammond, of Augusta, has been purchased  by a few humane gentlemen of this place, and liberated to exercise the  handsome ministerial gifts he possesses amongst us, and teach our youth  to read and write. He is a strong man about forty-nine years of age,  whose mother was white and whose father was an Indian. His wife and only  son are slaves.    Brother Francis has been in the ministry fifteen years, and will soon  receive ordination, and will probably become the pastor of a branch of  my large church, which is getting too unwieldy for one body. Should this  event take place, and his charge receive constitution, it will take the  rank and title of the 3rd Baptist Church in Savannah.    With the most sincere and ardent prayers to God for your temporal and  eternal welfare, and with the most unfeigned gratitude, I remain,  reverend and dear sir, your obliged servant in the gospel.

STATE OF THE NEGROES IN JAMAICA      Kingston, Jamaica, 1st May, 1802.    _Rev. and Dear Sir_,    Since our blessed Lord has been pleased to permit me to have the rule of  a church of believers, I have baptized one hundred and eleven: and I  have a sanction from the Rev. Dr. Thomas Rees, rector of this town and  parish, who is one of the ministers appointed by his Majesty to hold an  ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the clergy in this island, confirmed by  a law passed by the Legislative Body of this island, made and provided  for that purpose.    Our church consists of people of colour and black people; some of free  condition, but the greater part of them are slaves and natives from the  different countries in Africa. Our number both in town and country is  about five hundred brethren, and our rule is to baptize once in three  months; to receive the Lord's supper the first Lord's-day in every  month, after evening services is over; and we have meetings on Tuesday  and Thursday evenings throughout the year. The whole body of our church  is divided into several classes, which meet every Monday evening, to be  examined by their Class-leaders, respecting their daily walk and  conversation; and I am truly happy to acquaint you, that since the  gospel has been preached in Kingston, there never was so great a  prospect for the spread of the fame as there is now. Numbers and numbers  of young people are flocking daily to join both our society and the  Methodists, who have about four hundred. Religion so spreads in  Kingston, that those who will not leave the Church of England to join  the Dissenters, have formed themselves into evening societies: it is  delightful to hear the people at the different places singing psalms,  hymns, and spiritual songs; and to see a great number of them who lived  in the sinful state of fornication (which is the common way of living in  Jamaica), now married, having put away that deadly sin.    Our place of worship is so very much crowded, that numbers are obliged  to stand out of doors: we are going to build a larger chapel as soon as  possible. Our people being poor, and so many of them slaves, we are not  able to go on so quick as we could without we should meet with such  friends as love our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, to enable us in going  on with so glorious an undertaking.    I preach, baptize, marry, attend funerals, and go through every work of  the ministry without fee or reward; and I can boldly say, for these  sixteen years since I began to teach and instruct the poor Ethiopians in  this island, the word of God (though many and many times travelling  night and day over rivers and mountains to inculcate the ever-blessed  gospel), that I never was complimented with so much as a pair of shoes  to my feet, or a hat to my head, or money or apparel, or any thing else  as a recompense for my labour and my trouble, from any of my brethren or  any other person:--my intention is to follow the example set before me  by the holy apostle Saint Paul, to labour with my hands for the things I  stand in need of to support myself and family, and to let the church of  Christ be free from incumbrances.    We have five trustees to our chapel and burrying-ground, eight deacons,  and six exhorters.    I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. V. of his Majesty's ship Cumberland, in  this town, who has been at my house, and at our chapel, and has seen all  my church-books and the manner in which I have conducted our society. He  has lately sailed for England with Admiral Montagu; and when he sees you,  he will be able to tell you of our proceedings better than I can write.    All my beloved brethren beg their Christian love to you and all your dear  brethren in the best bonds; and they also beg yourself and them will be  pleased to remember the poor Ethiopian Baptists in their prayers, and be  pleased also to accept"]]]
