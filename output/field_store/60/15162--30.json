The fugitive and airy sounds, which seem so fleeting and so  changeable, prove to be more durable monuments than brass or granite. The  study of the Sanskrit language has told us a long story concerning the  origin of the Hindoos. It has rectified the ethnology of Blumenbach, has  taught us who were the ancestors of the nations of Europe, and has given  us the information that one great family, the Indo-European, has done most  of the work of the world. It shows us that this family consists of seven  races,--the Hindoos, the Persians, the^ Greeks, the Romans, who all  emigrated to the south from the original ancestral home; and the Kelts,  the Teutons, and Slavi, who entered Europe on the northern side of the  Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. This has been accomplished by the new  science of Comparative Philology. A comparison of languages has made it  too plain to be questioned, that these seven races were originally one;  that they must have emigrated from a region of Central Asia, at the east  of the Caspian, and northwest of India; that they were originally a  pastoral race, and gradually changed their habits as they descended from  those great plains into the valleys of the Indus and the Euphrates. In  these seven linguistic families the roots of the most common names are the  same; the grammatical constructions are also the same; so that no scholar,  who has attended to the subject, can doubt that the seven languages are  all daughters of one common mother-tongue.    Pursuing the subject still further, it has been found possible to  conjecture with no little confidence what was the condition of family life  in this great race of Central Asia, before its dispersion. The original  stock has received the name Aryan. This designation occurs in Manu (II.  22), who says: \"As far as the eastern and western oceans, between the two  mountains, lies the land which the wise have named Ar-ya-vesta, or  _inhabited by honorable men_.\" The people of Iran receive this same  appellation in the Zend Avesta, with the same meaning of _honorable_.  Herodotus testifies that the Medes were formerly called [Greek: Arioi]  (Herod. VII. 61). Strabo mentions that, in the time of Alexander, the  whole region about the Indus was called _Ariana_. In modern times, the  word _Iran_ for Persia and _Erin_ for Ireland are possible reminiscences  of the original family appellation.    The Ayrans, long before the age of the Vedas or the Zend Avesta, were  living as a pastoral people on the great plains east of the Caspian Sea.  What their condition was at that epoch is deduced by the following method:  If it is found that the name of any fact is the same in two or more of the  seven tribal languages of this stock, it is evident that the name was  given to it before they separated. For there is no reason to suppose that  two nations living wide apart would have independently selected the same  word for the same object. For example, since we find that _house_ is in  Sanskrit _Damn_ and _Dam_; in Zend, _Demana_; in Greek, [Greek: Domos]; in  Latin, _Domus_; in Irish, _Dahm_; in Slavonic, _Domu_,--from which root  comes also our English word _Domestic_,--we may be pretty sure that the  original Aryans lived in houses. When we learn that _boat_ was in Sanskrit  _Nau_ or _nauka_; in Persian, _Naw, nawah;_ in Greek, [Greek: Naus]; in  Latin, _Navis_; in old Irish, _Noi_ or _nai_; in old German, _Nawa_ or  _nawi_; and in Polish _Nawa_, we cannot doubt that they knew something of  what we call in English _Nau_tical affairs, or Navigation. But as the  words designating masts, sails, yards, &c. differ wholly from each other  in all these linguistic families, it is reasonable to infer that the  Aryans, before their dispersion, went only in boats, with oars, on the  rivers of their land, the Oxus and Jaxartes, and did not sail anywhere on  the sea.    Pursuing this method, we see that we can ask almost any question  concerning the condition of the Aryans, and obtain an answer by means of  Comparative Philology.    Were they a pastoral people? The very word _pastoral_ gives us the answer.  For _Pa_ in Sanskrit means to watch, to guard, as men guard cattle,--from  which a whole company of words has come in all the Aryan languages.    The results of this method of inquiry, so far as given by Pictet, are  these. Some 3000 years B.C.,[33] the Aryans, as yet undivided into  Hindoos, Persians, Kelts, Latins, Greeks, Teutons, and Slavi, were living  in Central Asia, in a region of which Bactriana was the centre. Here they  must have remained long enough to have developed their admirable language,  the mother-tongue of those which we know. They were essentially a  pastoral, but not a nomad people, having fixed homes. They had oxen,  horses, sheep, goats, hogs, and domestic fowls. Herds of cows fed in  pastures, each the property of a community, and each with a cluster of  stables in the centre. The daughters[34] of the house were the  dairy-maids; the food was chiefly the products of the dairy and the flesh  of the cattle. The cow was, however, the most important animal, and gave  its name to many plants, and even to the clouds and stars, in which men  saw heavenly herds passing over the firmament above them.    But the Aryans were not an exclusively pastoral people; they certainly had  barley, and perhaps other cereals, before their dispersion. They possessed  the plough, the mill for grinding grain; they had hatchet,[35] hammer,  auger. The Aryans were acquainted with several metals, among which were  gold, silver, copper, tin. They knew how to spin and weave to some extent;  they were acquainted with pottery. How their houses were built we do not  know, but they contained doors, windows, and fireplaces. They had cloaks  or mantles, they boiled and roasted meat, and certainly used soup. They  had lances, swords, the bow and arrow, shields, but not armor. They had  family life, some simple laws, games, the dance, and wind instruments.  They had the decimal numeration, and their year was of three hundred and  sixty days. They worshipped the heaven, earth, sun, fire, water, wind; but  there are also plain traces of an earlier monotheism, from which this  nature-worship proceeded.        Sec. 4. The Aryans in India. The Native Races. The Vedic Age. Theology of the  Vedas.      So far Comparative Philology takes us, and the next step forward brings us  to the Vedas, the oldest works in the Hindoo literature, but at least one  thousand or fifteen hundred years more recent than the times we have been  describing. The Aryans have separated, and the Hindoos are now in India.  It is eleven centuries before the time of Alexander. They occupy the  region between the Punjaub and the Ganges, and here was accomplished the  transition of the Aryans from warlike shepherds into agriculturists and  builders of cities.[36]    The last hymns of the Vedas were written (says St. Martin) when they  arrived from the Indus at the Ganges, and were building their oldest city,  at the confluence of that river with the Jumna. Their complexion was then  white, and they call the race whom they conquered, and who afterward were  made _Soudras_, or lowest caste, blacks.[37] The chief gods of the Vedic  age were Indra, Varuna, Agni, Savitri, Soma. The first was the god of the  atmosphere; the second, of the Ocean of light, or Heaven; the third, of  Fire;[38] the fourth, of the Sun; and the fifth, of the Moon. Yama was the  god of death. All the powers of nature were personified in turn,--as  earth, food, wine, months, seasons, day, night, and dawn. Among all these  divinities, Indra and Agni were the chief.[39] But behind this incipient  polytheism lurks the original monotheism,--for each of these gods, in  turn, becomes the Supreme Being. The universal Deity seems to become  apparent, first in one form of nature and then in another. Such is the  opinion of Colebrooke, who says that \"the ancient Hindoo religion  recognizes but one God, not yet sufficiently discriminating the creature  from the Creator.\" And Max Mueller says: \"The hymns celebrate Varuna,  Indra, Agni, &c., and each in turn is called supreme. The whole mythology  is fluent. The powers of nature become moral beings.\"    Max Mueller adds: \"It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the  Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme  and absolute. Agni is called 'Ruler of the Universe'; Indra is celebrated  as the Strongest god, and in one hymn it is said, 'Indra is stronger than  all.' It is said of Soma that 'he conquers every one.'\"    But clearer traces of monotheism are to be found in the Vedas. In one hymn  of the Rig-Veda it is said: \"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni;  then he is the well-winged heavenly Garutmat; that which is One, the wise  call it many ways; they call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.\"    Nothing, however, will give us so good an idea of the character of these  Vedic hymns as the hymns themselves. I therefore select a few of the most  striking of those which have been translated by Colebrooke, Wilson, M.  Mueller, E. Bumont, and others.    In the following, from one of the oldest Vedas, the unity of God seems  very clearly expressed.         RIG-VEDA, X. 121.       \"In the beginning there arose the Source of golden light. He was the     only born Lord of all that is. He established the earth, and this sky.     Who is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?       \"He who gives life. He who gives strength; whose blessing all the     bright gods desire; whose shadow is immortality, whose shadow is death.     Who is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?       \"He who through his power is the only king of the breathing and     awakening world. He who governs all, man and beast. Who is the god to     whom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"northern kingdom was a very different body from  that which bore the same name in England. It was ill constituted: it was  little considered; and it had never imposed any serious restraint on  any of his predecessors. The three Estates sate in one house. The  commissioners of the burghs were considered merely as retainers of the  great nobles. No act could be introduced till it had been approved by  the Lords of Articles, a committee which was really, though not in  form, nominated by the crown. But, though the Scottish Parliament was  obsequious, the Scottish people had always been singularly turbulent and  ungovernable. They had butchered their first James in his bedchamber:  they had repeatedly arrayed themselves in arms against James the  Second; they had slain James the Third on the field of battle: their  disobedience had broken the heart of James the Fifth: they had deposed  and imprisoned Mary: they had led her son captive; and their temper was  still as intractable as ever. Their habits were rude and martial. All  along the southern border, and all along the line between the highlands  and the lowlands, raged an incessant predatory war. In every part of the  country men were accustomed to redress their wrongs by the strong hand.  Whatever loyalty the nation had anciently felt to the Stuarts had cooled  during their long absence. The supreme influence over the public mind  was divided between two classes of malecontents, the lords of the soil  and the preachers; lords animated by the same spirit which had often  impelled the old Douglasses to withstand the royal house, and preachers  who had inherited the republican opinions and the unconquerable spirit  of Knox. Both the national and religious feelings of the population  had been wounded. All orders of men complained that their country, that  country which had, with so much glory, defended her independence against  the ablest and bravest Plantagenets, had, through the instrumentality of  her native princes, become in effect, though not in name, a province  of England. In no part of Europe had the Calvinistic doctrine and  discipline taken so strong a hold on the public mind. The Church of Rome  was regarded by the great body of the people with a hatred which might  justly be called ferocious; and the Church of England, which seemed  to be every day becoming more and more like the Church of Rome, was an  object of scarcely less aversion.    The government had long wished to extend the Anglican system over the  whole island, and had already, with this view, made several changes  highly distasteful to every Presbyterian. One innovation, however, the  most hazardous of all, because it was directly cognisable by the senses  of the common people, had not yet been attempted. The public worship  of God was still conducted in the manner acceptable to the nation. Now,  however, Charles and Laud determined to force on the Scots the English  liturgy, or rather a liturgy which, wherever it differed from that of  England, differed, in the judgment of all rigid Protestants, for the  worse.    To this step, taken in the mere wantonness of tyranny, and in criminal  ignorance or more criminal contempt of public feeling, our country owes  her freedom. The first performance of the foreign ceremonies produced  a riot. The riot rapidly became a revolution. Ambition, patriotism,  fanaticism, were mingled in one headlong torrent. The whole nation was  in arms. The power of England was indeed, as appeared some years later,  sufficient to coerce Scotland: but a large part of the English people  sympathised with the religious feelings of the insurgents; and many  Englishmen who had no scruple about antiphonies and genuflexions, altars  and surplices, saw with pleasure the progress of a rebellion which  seemed likely to confound the arbitrary projects of the court, and to  make the calling of a Parliament necessary.    For the senseless freak which had produced these effects Wentworth  is not responsible. [15] It had, in fact, thrown all his plans into  confusion. To counsel submission, however, was not in his nature. An  attempt was made to put down the insurrection by the sword: but the  King's military means and military talents were unequal to the task.  To impose fresh taxes on England in defiance of law, would, at this  conjuncture, have been madness. No resource was left but a Parliament;  and in the spring of 1640 a Parliament was convoked.    The nation had been put into good humour by the prospect of seeing  constitutional government restored, and grievances redressed. The new  House of Commons was more temperate and more respectful to the throne  than any which had sate since the death of Elizabeth. The moderation  of this assembly has been highly extolled by the most distinguished  Royalists and seems to have caused no small vexation and disappointment  to the chiefs of the opposition: but it was the uniform practice of  Charles, a practice equally impolitic and ungenerous, to refuse all  compliance with the desires of his people, till those desires  were expressed in a menacing tone. As soon as the Commons showed a  disposition to take into consideration the grievances under which  the country had suffered during eleven years, the King dissolved the  Parliament with every mark of displeasure.    Between the dissolution of this shortlived assembly and the meeting  of that ever memorable body known by the name of the Long Parliament,  intervened a few months, during which the yoke was pressed down more  severely than ever on the nation, while the spirit of the nation rose up  more angrily than ever against the yoke. Members of the House of Commons  were questioned by the Privy Council touching their parliamentary  conduct, and thrown into prison for refusing to reply. Shipmoney was  levied with increased rigour. The Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of London  were threatened with imprisonment for remissness in collecting the  payments. Soldiers were enlisted by force. Money for their support was  exacted from their counties. Torture, which had always been illegal, and  which had recently been declared illegal even by the servile judges of  that age, was inflicted for the last time in England in the month of  May, 1610.    Everything now depended on the event of the King's military operations  against the Scots. Among his troops there was little of that feeling  which separates professional soldiers from the mass of a nation, and  attaches them to their leaders. His army, composed for the most part of  recruits, who regretted the plough from which they had been violently  taken, and who were imbued with the religious and political sentiments  then prevalent throughout the country, was more formidable to himself  than to the enemy. The Scots, encouraged by the heads of the English  opposition, and feebly resisted by the English forces, marched across  the Tweed and the Tyne, and encamped on the borders of Yorkshire.  And now the murmurs of discontent swelled into an uproar by which all  spirits save one were overawed.    But the voice of Strafford was still for Thorough; and he even, in this  extremity, showed a nature so cruel and despotic, that his own pikemen  were ready to tear him in pieces.    There was yet one last expedient which, as the King flattered himself,  might save him from the misery of facing another House of Commons. To  the House of Lords he was less averse. The Bishops were devoted to  him; and though the temporal peers were generally dissatisfied with  his administration, they were, as a class, so deeply interested in the  maintenance of order, and in the stability of ancient institutions, that  they were not likely to call for extensive reforms. Departing from  the uninterrupted practice of centuries, he called a Great Council  consisting of Lords alone. But the Lords were too prudent to assume the  unconstitutional functions with which he wished to invest them. Without  money, without credit, without authority even in his own camp, he  yielded to the pressure of necessity. The Houses were convoked; and the  elections proved that, since the spring, the distrust and hatred with  which the government was regarded had made fearful progress.    In November, 1640, met that renowned Parliament which, in spite of many  errors and disasters, is justly entitled to the reverence and  gratitude of all who, in any part of the world enjoy the blessings of  constitutional government.    During the year which followed, no very important division of opinion  appeared in the Houses. The civil and ecclesiastical administration  had, through a period of nearly twelve years, been so oppressive and so  unconstitutional that even those classes of which the inclinations  are generally on the side of order and authority were eager to promote  popular reforms and to bring the instruments of tyranny to justice. It  was enacted that no interval of more than three years should ever elapse  between Parliament and Parliament, and that, if writs under the Great  Seal were not issued at the proper time, the returning officers should,  without such writs, call the constituent bodies together for the choice  of representatives. The Star Chamber, the High Commission, the Council  of York were swept away. Men who, after suffering cruel mutilations, had  been confined in remote dungeons, regained their liberty. On the chief  ministers of the crown the vengeance of the nation was unsparingly  wreaked. The Lord Keeper, the Primate, the Lord Lieutenant were  impeached. Finch saved himself by flight. Laud was flung into the Tower.  Strafford was put to death by act of attainder. On the day on which this  act passed, the King gave his assent to a law by which he bound himself  not to adjourn, prorogue, or dissolve the existing Parliament without  its own consent.    After ten months of assiduous toil, the Houses, in September 1641,  adjourned for a short vacation; and the King"]]]
