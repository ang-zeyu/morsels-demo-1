And  a strange secret does it often prove. A relative of mine was trying to  explain to a little girl what was meant by 'the passive voice': \"Suppose  that you kill me: you who do the killing are in the active voice, and I,  who am killed, am in the passive voice.\" \"But how can you speak if  you're killed?\" said the child. \"Oh, well, you may suppose that I am  not yet quite dead!\" The next day the child was asked, in class, to  explain the passive voice, and said, \"It's the kind of voice you speak  with when you ain't quite dead.\"    In such a case as this the illustration ought to have been more varied.  Every one's memory will probably furnish examples of the fantastic  meaning which their childhood attached to certain verbal statements (in  poetry often), and which their elders, not having any reason to suspect,  never corrected. I remember being greatly moved emotionally at the age  of eight by the ballad of Lord Ullin's Daughter. Yet I thought that the  staining of the heather by the blood was the evil chiefly dreaded, and  that, when the boatman said,      \"I'll row you o'er the ferry.    It is not for your silver bright,    But for your winsome lady,\"    he was to receive the lady for his pay. Similarly, I recently found that  one of my own children was reading (and accepting) a verse of Tennyson's  In Memoriam as      \"Ring out the _food_ of rich and poor,       Ring in _redness_ to all mankind,\"    and finding no inward difficulty.    The only safeguard against this sort of misconceiving is to insist on  varied statement, and to bring the child's conceptions, wherever it be  possible, to some sort of practical test.    Let us next pass to the subject of Apperception.          XIV. APPERCEPTION      'Apperception' is a word which cuts a great figure in the pedagogics of  the present day. Read, for example, this advertisement of a certain  text-book, which I take from an educational journal:--         #WHAT IS APPERCEPTION?#         For an explanation of Apperception see Blank's PSYCHOLOGY,       Vol. ---- of the ---- Education Series, just published.         The difference between Perception and Apperception is       explained for the teacher in the preface to Blank's       PSYCHOLOGY.         Many teachers are inquiring, \"What is the meaning of       Apperception in educational psychology?\" Just the book for       them is Blank's PSYCHOLOGY in which the idea was first       expounded.         The most important idea in educational psychology is       Apperception. The teacher may find this expounded in Blank's       PSYCHOLOGY. The idea of Apperception is making a revolution       in educational methods in Germany. It is explained in Blank's       PSYCHOLOGY, Vol. ---- of the ---- Education Series, just       published.         Blank's PSYCHOLOGY will be mailed prepaid to any address on       receipt of $1.00.      Such an advertisement is in sober earnest a disgrace to all concerned;  and such talk as it indulges in is the sort of thing I had in view when  I said at our first meeting that the teachers were suffering at the  present day from a certain industrious mystification on the part of  editors and publishers. Perhaps the word 'apperception' flourished in  their eyes and ears as it nowadays often is, embodies as much of this  mystification as any other single thing. The conscientious young teacher  is led to believe that it contains a recondite and portentous secret, by  losing the true inwardness of which her whole career may be shattered.  And yet, when she turns to the books and reads about it, it seems so  trivial and commonplace a matter,--meaning nothing more than the manner  in which we receive a thing into our minds,--that she fears she must  have missed the point through the shallowness of her intelligence, and  goes about thereafter afflicted with a sense either of uncertainty or of  stupidity, and in each case remaining mortified at being so inadequate  to her mission.    Now apperception is an extremely useful word in pedagogics, and offers a  convenient name for a process to which every teacher must frequently  refer. But it verily means nothing more than the act of taking a thing  into the mind. It corresponds to nothing peculiar or elementary in  psychology, being only one of the innumerable results of the  psychological process of association of ideas; and psychology itself can  easily dispense with the word, useful as it may be in pedagogics.    The gist of the matter is this: Every impression that comes in from  without, be it a sentence which we hear, an object of vision, or an  effluvium which assails our nose, no sooner enters our consciousness  than it is drafted off in some determinate direction or other, making  connection with the other materials already there, and finally producing  what we call our reaction. The particular connections it strikes into  are determined by our past experiences and the 'associations' of the  present sort of impression with them. If, for instance, you hear me call  out A, B, C, it is ten to one that you will react on the impression by  inwardly or outwardly articulating D, E, F. The impression arouses its  old associates: they go out to meet it; it is received by them,  recognized by the mind as 'the beginning of the alphabet.' It is the  fate of every impression thus to fall into a mind preoccupied with  memories, ideas, and interests, and by these it is taken in. Educated as  we already are, we never get an experience that remains for us  completely nondescript: it always _reminds_ of something similar in  quality, or of some context that might have surrounded it before, and  which it now in some way suggests. This mental escort which the mind  supplies is drawn, of course, from the mind's ready-made stock. We  _conceive_ the impression in some definite way. We dispose of it  according to our acquired possibilities, be they few or many, in the way  of 'ideas.' This way of taking in the object is the process of  apperception. The conceptions which meet and assimilate it are called by  Herbart the 'apperceiving mass.' The apperceived impression is engulfed  in this, and the result is a new field of consciousness, of which one  part (and often a very small part) comes from the outer world, and  another part (sometimes by far the largest) comes from the previous  contents of the mind.    I think that you see plainly enough now that the process of apperception  is what I called it a moment ago, a resultant of the association of  ideas. The product is a sort of fusion of the new with the old, in which  it is often impossible to distinguish the share of the two factors. For  example, when we listen to a person speaking or read a page of print,  much of what we think we see or hear is supplied from our memory. We  overlook misprints, imagining the right letters, though we see the wrong  ones; and how little we actually hear, when we listen to speech, we  realize when we go to a foreign theatre; for there what troubles us is  not so much that we cannot understand what the actors say as that we  cannot hear their words. The fact is that we hear quite as little under  similar conditions at home, only our mind, being fuller of English  verbal associations, supplies the requisite material for comprehension  upon a much slighter auditory hint.    In all the apperceptive operations of the mind, a certain general law  makes itself felt,--the law of economy. In admitting a new body of  experience, we instinctively seek to disturb as little as possible our  pre-existing stock of ideas. We always try to name a new experience in  some way which will assimilate it to what we already know. We hate  anything _absolutely_ new, anything without any name, and for which a  new name must be forged. So we take the nearest name, even though it be  inappropriate. A child will call snow, when he sees it for the first  time, sugar or white butterflies. The sail of a boat he calls a curtain;  an egg in its shell, seen for the first time, he calls a pretty potato;  an orange, a ball; a folding corkscrew, a pair of bad scissors. Caspar  Hauser called the first geese he saw horses, and the Polynesians called  Captain Cook's horses pigs. Mr. Rooper has written a little book on  apperception, to which he gives the title of \"A Pot of Green Feathers,\"  that being the name applied to a pot of ferns by a child who had never  seen ferns before.    In later life this economical tendency to leave the old undisturbed  leads to what we know as 'old fogyism.' A new idea or a fact which would  entail extensive rearrangement of the previous system of beliefs is  always ignored or extruded from the mind in case it cannot be  sophistically reinterpreted so as to tally harmoniously with the system.  We have all conducted discussions with middle-aged people, overpowered  them with our reasons, forced them to admit our contention, and a week  later found them back as secure and constant in their old opinion as if  they had never conversed with us at all. We call them old fogies; but  there are young fogies, too. Old fogyism begins at a younger age than  we think. I am almost afraid to say so, but I believe that in the  majority of human beings it begins at about twenty-five.    In some of the books we find the various forms of apperception codified,  and their subdivisions numbered and ticketed in tabular form in the way  so delightful to the pedagogic eye. In one book which I remember reading  there were sixteen different types of apperception discriminated from  each other. There was associative apperception, subsumptive  apperception, assimilative apperception, and others up to sixteen. It is  needless to say that this is nothing but an exhibition of the crass  artificiality which has always haunted psychology, and which perpetuates  itself by lingering along, especially in these works which are  advertised as 'written for the use of teachers.'
