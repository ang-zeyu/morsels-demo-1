Anyway, the two loons faced about at the same moment and came tearing  down the line, using wings and feet to help in the race. The upper  loons swung in behind them as they passed, so as to watch the finish  better; but not a sound was heard till they passed my end of the line  in a close, hard race, one scarcely a yard ahead of the other, when  such a yelling began as I never heard before. All the loons gathered  about the two swimmers; there was much cackling and crying, which grew  gradually quieter; then they began to string out in another long line,  and two more racers took their places at one end of it. By that time  it was almost dark, and I broke up the race trying to get nearer in my  canoe so as to watch things better. Twice since then I have heard  from summer campers of their having seen loons racing across a lake. I  have no doubt it is a frequent pastime with the birds when the summer  cares for the young are ended, and autumn days are mellow, and fish  are plenty, and there are long hours just for fun together, before  Hukweem moves southward for the hard solitary winter life on the  seacoast.    Of all the loons that cried out to me in the night, or shared the  summer lakes with me, only one ever gave me the opportunity of  watching at close quarters. It was on a very wild lake, so wild that  no one had ever visited it before in summer, and a mother loon felt  safe in leaving the open shore, where she generally nests, and placing  her eggs on a bog at the head of a narrow bay. I found them there a  day or two after my arrival.    I used to go at all hours of the day, hoping the mother would get used  to me and my canoe, so that I could watch her later, teaching her  little ones; but her wildness was unconquerable. Whenever I came in  sight of the nest-bog, with only the loon's neck and head visible,  standing up very straight and still in the grass, I would see her slip  from the nest, steal away through the green cover to a deep place, and  glide under water without leaving a ripple. Then, looking sharp over  the side into the clear water, I would get a glimpse of her, just a  gray streak with a string of silver bubbles, passing deep and swift  under my canoe. So she went through the opening, and appeared far out  in the lake, where she would swim back and forth, as if fishing, until  I went away. As I never disturbed her nest, and always paddled away  soon, she thought undoubtedly that she had fooled me, and that I knew  nothing about her or her nest.    Then I tried another plan. I lay down in my canoe, and had Simmo  paddle me up to the nest. While the loon was out on the lake, hidden  by the grassy shore, I went and sat on a bog, with a friendly alder  bending over me, within twenty feet of the nest, which was in plain  sight. Then Simmo paddled away, and Hukweem came back without the  slightest suspicion. As I had supposed, from the shape of the nest,  she did not sit on her two eggs; she sat on the bog instead, and  gathered them close to her side with her wing. That was all the  brooding they had, or needed; for within a week there were two bright  little loons to watch instead of the eggs.    After the first success I used to go alone and, while the mother bird  was out on the lake, would pull my canoe up in the grass, a hundred  yards or so below the nest. From here I entered the alders and made  my way to the bog, where I could watch Hukweem at my leisure. After a  long wait she would steal into the bay very shyly, and after much fear  and circumspection glide up to the canoe. It took a great deal of  looking and listening to convince her that it was harmless, and that I  was not hiding near in the grass. Once convinced, however, she would  come direct to the nest; and I had the satisfaction at last of  watching a loon at close quarters.    She would sit there for hours--never sleeping apparently, for her eye  was always bright--preening herself, turning her head slowly, so as to  watch on all sides, snapping now and then at an obtrusive fly, all in  utter unconsciousness that I was just behind her, watching every  movement. Then, when I had enough, I would steal away along a caribou  path, and push off quietly in my canoe without looking back. She saw  me, of course, when I entered the canoe, but not once did she leave  the nest. When I reached the open lake, a little searching with my  glass always showed me her head there in the grass, still turned in my  direction apprehensively.    I had hoped to see her let the little ones out of their hard shell,  and see them first take the water; but that was too much to expect.  One day I heard them whistling in the eggs; the next day, when I  came, there was nothing to be seen on the nest-bog. I feared that  something had heard their whistling and put an untimely end to the  young Hukweems while mother bird was away. But when she came back,  after a more fearful survey than usual of the old bark canoe, two  downy little fellows came bobbing to meet her out of the grass, where  she had hidden them and told them to stay till she came back.    It was a rare treat to watch them at their first feeding, the little  ones all eagerness, bobbing about in the delight of eating and the  wonder of the new great world, the mother all tenderness and  watchfulness. Hukweem had never looked to me so noble before. This  great wild mother bird, moving ceaselessly with marvelous grace about  her little ones, watching their play with exquisite fondness, and  watching the great dangerous world for their sakes, now chiding them  gently, now drawing near to touch them with her strong bill, or to rub  their little cheeks with hers, or just to croon over them in an  ecstasy of that wonderful mother love which makes the summer  wilderness beautiful,--in ten minutes she upset all my theories, and  won me altogether, spite of what I had heard and seen of her  destructiveness on the fishing grounds. After all, why should she not  fish as well as I? And then began the first lessons in swimming and  hiding and diving, which I had waited so long to see.    Later I saw her bring little fish, which she had slightly wounded,  turn them loose in shallow water, and with a sharp cluck bring the  young loons out of their hiding, to set them chasing and diving wildly  for their own dinners. But before that happened there was almost a  tragedy.    One day, while the mother was gone fishing, the little ones came out  of their hiding among the grasses, and ventured out some distance into  the bay. It was their first journey alone into the world; they were  full of the wonder and importance of it. Suddenly, as I watched, they  began to dart about wildly, moving with astonishing rapidity for such  little fellows, and whistling loudly. From the bank above, a swift  ripple had cut out into the water between them and the only bit of bog  with which they were familiar. Just behind the ripple were the sharp  nose and the beady eyes of Musquash, who is always in some mischief of  this kind. In one of his prowlings he had discovered the little brood;  now he was manoeuvering craftily to keep the frightened youngsters  moving till they should be tired out, while he himself crept carefully  between them and the shore.    Musquash knows well that when a young loon, or a shelldrake, or a  black duck, is caught in the open like that, he always tries to get  back where his mother hid him when she went away. That is what the  poor little fellows were trying to do now, only to be driven back and  kept moving wildly by the muskrat, who lifted himself now and then  from the water, and wiggled his ugly jaws in anticipation of the  feast. He had missed the eggs in his search; but young loon would be  better, and more of it.--\"There you are!\" he snapped viciously,  lunging at the nearest loon, which flashed under water and barely  escaped.    I had started up to interfere, for I had grown fond of the little wild  things whose growth I had watched from the beginning, when a great  splashing began on my left, and I saw the old mother bird coming like  a fury. She was half swimming, half flying, tearing over the water at  a great pace, a foamy white wake behind her.--\"Now, you little  villain, take your medicine. It's coming; it's coming,\" I cried  excitedly, and dodged back to watch. But Musquash, intent on his evil  doing (he has no need whatever to turn flesh-eater), kept on viciously  after the exhausted little ones, paying no heed to his rear.    Twenty yards away the mother bird, to my great astonishment, flashed  out of sight under water. What could it mean! But there was little  time to wonder. Suddenly a catapult seemed to strike the muskrat from  beneath and lift him clear from the water. With a tremendous rush and  sputter Hukweem came out beneath him, her great pointed bill driven  through to his spine. Little need of my help now. With another  straight hard drive, this time at eye and brain, she flung him aside  disdainfully and rushed to her shivering little ones, questioning,  chiding, praising them, all in the same breath, fluttering and  cackling low in an hysteric wave of tenderness. Then she swam twice  around the dead muskrat and led her brood away from the place.    Perhaps it was to one of those same little ones that I owe a service  for which I am more than grateful. It was in September, when I was at  a lake ten miles away--the same lake into which a score of frolicking  young loons gathered before moving south, and swam a race or two for  my benefit. I was lost one day, hopelessly lost, in trying to make my  way from a wild little lake where I had been fishing, to the large  lake where my camp was. It was late afternoon. To avoid the long hard  tramp down a river, up which I had come in the early morning, I  attempted to cut across through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#20)"],[1,"him, though a  safe-conduct was offered, was outlawed and proclaimed a rebel, while  Huntly's son, Lord George, was to be restored to his estates.  Thus  everything seemed to indicate that Mary had been exasperated into  breaking with the party of moderation, the party of Murray and  Lethington, and been driven into courses where her support, if any, must  come from France and Rome.  Yet she married without waiting for the  necessary dispensation from the Pope.  Her policy was henceforth  influenced by her favour to Riccio, and by the jealous and arrogant  temper of her husband.  Mary well knew that Elizabeth had sent money to  her rebels, whom she now pursued all through the south of Scotland; they  fled from Edinburgh, where the valiant Brethren, brave enough in throwing  stones at pilloried priests, refused to join them; and despite the feuds  in her own camp, where Bothwell and Darnley were already on the worst  terms, Mary drove the rebel lords across the Border at Carlisle on  October 8.    Mary seemed triumphant, but the men with her--Lethington, and Morton the  Chancellor--were disaffected; Darnley was mutinous: he thought himself  neglected; he and his father resented Mary's leniency to Chatelherault,  who had submitted and been sent to France; all parties hated Riccio.  There was to be a Parliament early in March 1566.  In February Mary sent  the Bishop of Dunblane to Rome to ask for a subsidy; she intended to  reintroduce the Spiritual Estate into the House as electors of the Lords  of the Articles, \"tending to have done some good anent the restoring of  the old religion.\"  The Nuncio who was to have brought the Pope's money  later insisted that Mary should take the heads of Murray, Argyle, Morton,  and Lethington!  Whether she aimed at securing more than tolerance for  Catholics is uncertain; but the Parliament, in which the exiled Lords  were to be forfeited, was never held.  The other nobles would never  permit such a measure.    George Douglas, a stirring cadet of the great House was exciting  Darnley's jealousy of Riccio, but already Randolph (February 5, 1566) had  written to Cecil that \"the wisest were aiming at putting all in hazard\"  to restore the exiled Lords.  The nobles, in the last resort, would all  stand by each other: there was now a Douglas plot of the old sort to  bring back the exiles; and Darnley, with his jealous desire to murder  Riccio, was but the cat's-paw to light the train and explode Mary and her  Government.  Ruthven, whom Mary had always distrusted, came into the  conspiracy.  Through Randolph all was known in England.  \"Bands\" were  drawn up, signed by Argyll (safe in his own hills), Murray, Glencairn,  Rothes, Boyd, Ochiltree (the father of Knox's young wife), and Darnley.  His name was put forward; his rights and succession were secured against  the Hamiltons; Protestantism, too, was to be defended.  Many Douglases,  many of the Lothian gentry, were in the plot.  Murray was to arrive from  England as soon as Riccio had been slain and Mary had been seized.    Randolph knew all and reported to Elizabeth's ministers.    The plan worked with mechanical precision.  On March 9 Morton and his  company occupied Holyrood, going up the great staircase about eight at  night; while Darnley and Ruthven, a dying man, entered the queen's supper-  room by a privy stair.  Morton's men burst in, Riccio was dragged forth,  and died under forty daggers.  Bothwell, Atholl, and Huntly, partisans of  Mary, escaped from the palace; with them Mary managed to communicate on  the morrow, when she also held talk with Murray, who had returned with  the other exiles.  She had worked on the fears and passions of Darnley;  by promises of amnesty the Lords were induced to withdraw their guards  next day, and in the following night, by a secret passage, and through  the tombs of kings, Mary and Darnley reached the horses brought by Arthur  Erskine.    It was a long dark ride to Dunbar, but there Mary was safe.  She pardoned  and won over Glencairn, whom she liked, and Rothes; Bothwell and Huntly  joined her with a sufficient force, Ruthven and Morton fled to Berwick  (Ruthven was to die in England), and Knox hastened into Kyle in Ayrshire.  Darnley, who declared his own innocence and betrayed his accomplices, was  now equally hated and despised by his late allies and by the queen and  Murray,--indeed, by all men, chiefly by Morton and Argyll.  Lethington  was in hiding; but he was indispensable, and in September was reconciled  to Mary.    On June 19, in Edinburgh Castle, she bore her child, later James VI.; on  her recovery Darnley was insolent, and was the more detested, while  Bothwell was high in favour.  In October most of the Lords signed, with  Murray, a band for setting Darnley aside--_not_ for his murder.  He is  said to have denounced Mary to Spain, France, and Rome for neglecting  Catholic interests.  In mid-October Mary was seriously ill at Jedburgh,  where Bothwell, wounded in an encounter with a Border reiver, was  welcomed, while Darnley, coldly received, went to his father's house on  the Forth.  On her recovery Mary resided in the last days of November at  Craigmillar Castle, near Edinburgh.  Here Murray, Argyll, Bothwell,  Huntly, and Lethington held counsel with her as to Darnley.  Lethington  said that \"a way would be found,\" a way that Parliament would approve,  while Murray would \"look through his fingers.\"  Lennox believed that the  plan was to arrest Darnley on some charge, and slay him if he resisted.    At Stirling (December 17), when the young prince was baptised with  Catholic rites, Darnley did not appear; he sulked in his own rooms.  A  week later, the exiles guilty of Riccio's murder were recalled, among  them Morton; and Darnley, finding all his enemies about to be united,  went to Glasgow, where he fell ill of smallpox.  Mary offered a visit  (she had had the malady as a child), and was rudely rebuffed (January 1-  13, 1567), but she was with him by January 21.  From Glasgow, at this  time, was written the long and fatal letter to Bothwell, which places  Mary's guilt in luring Darnley to his death beyond doubt, if we accept  the letters as authentic. {129}    Darnley was carried in a litter to the lonely house of Kirk o' Field, on  the south wall of Edinburgh.  Here Mary attended him in his sickness.  On  Sunday morning, February 9, Murray left Edinburgh for Fife.  In the night  of Sunday 9-Monday 10, the house where Darnley lay was blown up by  gunpowder, and he, with an attendant, was found dead in the garden: how  he was slain is not known.    That Bothwell, in accordance with a band signed by himself, Huntly,  Argyll, and Lethington, and aided by some Border ruffians, laid and  exploded the powder is certain.  Morton was apprised by Lethington and  Bothwell of the plot, but refused to join it without Mary's written  commission, which he did not obtain.  Against the queen there is no  trustworthy direct evidence (if we distrust her alleged letters to  Bothwell), but her conduct in protecting and marrying Bothwell (who was  really in love with his wife) shows that she did not disapprove.  The  trial of Bothwell was a farce; Mary's abduction by him (April 24) and  retreat with him to Dunbar was collusive.  She married Bothwell on May  15.  Her nobles, many of whom had signed a document urging her to marry  Bothwell, rose against her; on June 15, 1567, she surrendered to them at  Carberry Hill, while they, several of them deep in the murder plot, were  not sorry to let Bothwell escape to Dunbar.  After some piratical  adventures, being pursued by Kirkcaldy he made his way to Denmark, where  he died a prisoner.    Mary, first carried to Edinburgh and there insulted by the populace, was  next hurried to Lochleven Castle.  Her alleged letters to Bothwell were  betrayed to the Lords (June 21), probably through Sir James Balfour, who  commanded in Edinburgh Castle.  Perhaps Murray (who had left for France  before the marriage to Bothwell), perhaps fear of Elizabeth, or human  pity, induced her captors, contrary to the counsel of Lethington, to  spare her life, when she had signed her abdication, while they crowned  her infant son.  Murray accepted the Regency; a Parliament in December  established the Kirk; acquitted themselves of rebellion; and announced  that they had proof of Mary's guilt in her own writing.  Her romantic  escape from Lochleven (May 2, 1568) gave her but an hour of freedom.  Defeated on her march to Dumbarton Castle in the battle of Langside Hill,  she lost heart and fled to the coast of Galloway; on May 16 crossed the  Solway to Workington in Cumberland; and in a few days was Elizabeth's  prisoner in Carlisle Castle.    Mary had hitherto been a convinced but not a very obedient daughter of  the Church; for example, it appears that she married Darnley before the  arrival of the Pope's dispensation.  At this moment Philip of Spain, the  French envoy to Scotland, and the French Court had no faith in her  innocence of Darnley's death; and the Pope said \"he knew not which of  these ladies were the better\"--Mary or Elizabeth.  But from this time,  while a captive in England, Mary was the centre of the hopes of English  Catholics: in miniatures she appears as queen, quartering the English  arms; she might further the ends of Spain, of France, of Rome, of English  rebels, while her existence was a nightmare to the Protestants of  Scotland and a peril to Elizabeth.    After Mary's flight, Murray was, as has been said, Regent for the crowned  baby James.  In his council were the sensual, brutal, but vigorous  Morton, with Mar, later himself Regent, a man of milder nature;  Glencairn; Ruthven, whom Mary detested--he had tried to make unwelcome  love to her at Lochleven; and \"the necessary evil,\" Lethington.  How a  man so wily became a party to the murder of Darnley cannot be known: now  he began to perceive that, if Mary were restored, as he"]]]
