[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#20)"],[1,"  What were we to do now?  Our stores of provisions, supplemented by our  guns, were holding out well, but the day must come when they would need  replenishment.  In a couple of months the rains might be expected, and  we should be washed out of our camp.  The rock was harder than marble,  and any attempt at cutting a path for so great a height was more than  our time or resources would admit.  No wonder that we looked gloomily  at each other that night, and sought our blankets with hardly a word  exchanged.  I remember that as I dropped off to sleep my last  recollection was that Challenger was squatting, like a monstrous  bull-frog, by the fire, his huge head in his hands, sunk apparently in  the deepest thought, and entirely oblivious to the good-night which I  wished him.    But it was a very different Challenger who greeted us in the morning--a  Challenger with contentment and self-congratulation shining from his  whole person.  He faced us as we assembled for breakfast with a  deprecating false modesty in his eyes, as who should say, \"I know that  I deserve all that you can say, but I pray you to spare my blushes by  not saying it.\"  His beard bristled exultantly, his chest was thrown  out, and his hand was thrust into the front of his jacket.  So, in his  fancy, may he see himself sometimes, gracing the vacant pedestal in  Trafalgar Square, and adding one more to the horrors of the London  streets.    \"Eureka!\" he cried, his teeth shining through his beard.  \"Gentlemen,  you may congratulate me and we may congratulate each other.  The  problem is solved.\"    \"You have found a way up?\"    \"I venture to think so.\"    \"And where?\"    For answer he pointed to the spire-like pinnacle upon our right.    Our faces--or mine, at least--fell as we surveyed it.  That it could be  climbed we had our companion's assurance.  But a horrible abyss lay  between it and the plateau.    \"We can never get across,\" I gasped.    \"We can at least all reach the summit,\" said he.  \"When we are up I may  be able to show you that the resources of an inventive mind are not yet  exhausted.\"    After breakfast we unpacked the bundle in which our leader had brought  his climbing accessories.  From it he took a coil of the strongest and  lightest rope, a hundred and fifty feet in length, with climbing irons,  clamps, and other devices.  Lord John was an experienced mountaineer,  and Summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times, so that I  was really the novice at rock-work of the party; but my strength and  activity may have made up for my want of experience.    It was not in reality a very stiff task, though there were moments  which made my hair bristle upon my head.  The first half was perfectly  easy, but from there upwards it became continually steeper until, for  the last fifty feet, we were literally clinging with our fingers and  toes to tiny ledges and crevices in the rock.  I could not have  accomplished it, nor could Summerlee, if Challenger had not gained the  summit (it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a  creature) and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the considerable  tree which grew there.  With this as our support, we were soon able to  scramble up the jagged wall until we found ourselves upon the small  grassy platform, some twenty-five feet each way, which formed the  summit.    The first impression which I received when I had recovered my breath  was of the extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed.  The whole Brazilian plain seemed to lie beneath us, extending away and  away until it ended in dim blue mists upon the farthest sky-line.  In  the foreground was the long slope, strewn with rocks and dotted with  tree-ferns; farther off in the middle distance, looking over the  saddle-back hill, I could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboos  through which we had passed; and then, gradually, the vegetation  increased until it formed the huge forest which extended as far as the  eyes could reach, and for a good two thousand miles beyond.    I was still drinking in this wonderful panorama when the heavy hand of  the Professor fell upon my shoulder.    \"This way, my young friend,\" said he; \"vestigia nulla retrorsum.  Never  look rearwards, but always to our glorious goal.\"    The level of the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we  stood, and the green bank of bushes, with occasional trees, was so near  that it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained.  At a  rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see,  it might as well have been forty miles.  I placed one arm round the  trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss.  Far down were the small  dark figures of our servants, looking up at us.  The wall was  absolutely precipitous, as was that which faced me.    \"This is indeed curious,\" said the creaking voice of Professor  Summerlee.    I turned, and found that he was examining with great interest the tree  to which I clung.  That smooth bark and those small, ribbed leaves  seemed familiar to my eyes.  \"Why,\" I cried, \"it's a beech!\"    \"Exactly,\" said Summerlee.  \"A fellow-countryman in a far land.\"    \"Not only a fellow-countryman, my good sir,\" said Challenger, \"but  also, if I may be allowed to enlarge your simile, an ally of the first  value.  This beech tree will be our saviour.\"    \"By George!\" cried Lord John, \"a bridge!\"    \"Exactly, my friends, a bridge!  It is not for nothing that I expended  an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation.  I have some  recollection of once remarking to our young friend here that G. E. C.  is at his best when his back is to the wall.  Last night you will admit  that all our backs were to the wall.  But where will-power and  intellect go together, there is always a way out.  A drawbridge had to  be found which could be dropped across the abyss.  Behold it!\"    It was certainly a brilliant idea.  The tree was a good sixty feet in  height, and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the  chasm.  Challenger had slung the camp axe over his shoulder when he  ascended.  Now he handed it to me.    \"Our young friend has the thews and sinews,\" said he.  \"I think he will  be the most useful at this task.  I must beg, however, that you will  kindly refrain from thinking for yourself, and that you will do exactly  what you are told.\"    Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as  would ensure that it should fall as we desired.  It had already a  strong, natural tilt in the direction of the plateau, so that the  matter was not difficult.  Finally I set to work in earnest upon the  trunk, taking turn and turn with Lord John.  In a little over an hour  there was a loud crack, the tree swayed forward, and then crashed over,  burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side.  The severed  trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform, and for one terrible  second we all thought it was over.  It balanced itself, however, a few  inches from the edge, and there was our bridge to the unknown.    All of us, without a word, shook hands with Professor Challenger, who  raised his straw hat and bowed deeply to each in turn.    \"I claim the honor,\" said he, \"to be the first to cross to the unknown  land--a fitting subject, no doubt, for some future historical painting.\"    He had approached the bridge when Lord John laid his hand upon his coat.    \"My dear chap,\" said he, \"I really cannot allow it.\"    \"Cannot allow it, sir!\"  The head went back and the beard forward.    \"When it is a matter of science, don't you know, I follow your lead  because you are by way of bein' a man of science.  But it's up to you  to follow me when you come into my department.\"    \"Your department, sir?\"    \"We all have our professions, and soldierin' is mine.  We are,  accordin' to my ideas, invadin' a new country, which may or may not be  chock-full of enemies of sorts.  To barge blindly into it for want of a  little common sense and patience isn't my notion of management.\"    The remonstrance was too reasonable to be disregarded.  Challenger  tossed his head and shrugged his heavy shoulders.    \"Well, sir, what do you propose?\"    \"For all I know there may be a tribe of cannibals waitin' for  lunch-time among those very bushes,\" said Lord John, looking across the  bridge.  \"It's better to learn wisdom before you get into a  cookin'-pot; so we will content ourselves with hopin' that there is no  trouble waitin' for us, and at the same time we will act as if there  were.  Malone and I will go down again, therefore, and we will fetch up  the four rifles, together with Gomez and the other.  One man can then  go across and the rest will cover him with guns, until he sees that it  is safe for the whole crowd to come along.\"    Challenger sat down upon the cut stump and groaned his impatience; but  Summerlee and I were of one mind that Lord John was our leader when  such practical details were in question.  The climb was a more simple  thing now that the rope dangled down the face of the worst part of the  ascent.  Within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shot-gun.  The half-breeds had ascended also, and under Lord John's orders they  had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration  should be a long one.  We had each bandoliers of cartridges.    \"Now, Challenger, if you really insist upon being the first man in,\"  said Lord John, when every preparation was complete.    \"I am much indebted to you for your gracious permission,\" said the  angry Professor; for never was a man so intolerant of every form of  authority.  \"Since you are good enough to allow it, I shall most  certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion.\"    Seating himself with a leg overhanging the abyss on each side, and his  hatchet slung upon his back, Challenger hopped his way across the trunk  and was soon at the other side.  He clambered up and waved "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#20)"],[1,"\" said a spruce, slim young man. \"But the public is not  allowed to vote here,\" he added. He was standing on the floor and  resting his elbows on the table. Mrs. Brewton stared down at him. \"Are  you the father of the child?\" she inquired. \"Oh no! I am the agent. I--\"  \"Aqua Marine's agent?\" said Mrs. Brewton, sharply. \"Ha, ha!\" went the  young man. \"Ha, ha! Well, that's good too. She's part of our exhibit.  I'm in charge of the manna-feds, don't you know?\" \"I don't know,\" said  Mrs. Brewton. \"Why, Mrs. Eden's Manna in the Wilderness! Nourishes,  strengthens, and makes no unhealthy fat. Take a circular, and welcome.  I'm travelling for the manna. I organized this show. I've conducted  twenty-eight similar shows in two years. We hold them in every State  and Territory. Second of last March I gave Denver--you heard of it,  probably?\" \"I did not,\" said Mrs. Brewton. \"Well! Ha, ha! I thought  every person up to date had heard of Denver's Olympic Offspring Olio.\"  \"Is it up to date to loll your elbows on the table when you're speaking  to a lady?\" inquired Mrs. Brewton. He jumped, and then grew scarlet  with rage. \"I didn't expect to learn manners in New Mexico,\" said he.  \"I doubt if you will,\" said Mrs. Brewton, and turned her back on him. He  was white now; but better instincts, or else business, prevailed in his  injured bosom. \"Well,\" said he, \"I had no bad intentions. I was going  to say you'd have seen ten thousand people and five hundred babies at  Denver. And our manna-feds won out to beat the band. Three first medals,  and all exclusively manna-fed. We took the costume prize also. Of course  here in Sharon I've simplified. No special medal for weight, beauty,  costume, or decorated perambulator. Well, I must go back to our exhibit.  Glad to have you give us a call up there and see the medals we're  offering, and our fifteen manna-feds, and take a package away with you.\"  He was gone.    The voters had been now voting in my two boxes for some time, and I  found myself hoping the manna would not win, whoever did; but it seemed  this agent was a very capable person. To begin with, every family  entering a baby drew a package of the manna free, and one package  contained a diamond ring. Then, he had managed to have the finest babies  of all classes in his own exhibit. This was incontestable, Mrs. Brewton  admitted, after returning from a general inspection; and it seemed to us  extraordinary. \"That's easy, ma'am,\" said Gadsden; \"he came around here  a month ago. Don't you see?\" I did not see, but Mrs. Brewton saw at  once. He had made a quiet selection of babies beforehand, and then  introduced the manna into those homes. And everybody in the room was  remarking that his show was very superior, taken as a whole they all  added, \"taken as a whole\"; I heard them as they came up to vote for  the 3-year and the 18-month classes. The 6-month was to wait till  last, because the third box had been accidentally smashed by Mr. Smith.  Gadsden caught several trying to vote twice. \"No, you don't!\" he would  shout. \"I know faces. I'm not a conductor for nothing.\" And the victim  would fall back amid jeers from the sun-bonnets. Once the passengers  sent over to know when the train was going. \"Tell them to step over here  and they'll not feel so lonesome!\" shouted Gadsden; and I think a good  many came. The band was playing \"White Wings,\" with quite a number  singing it, when Gadsden noticed the voting had ceased, and announced  this ballot closed. The music paused for him, and we could suddenly hear  how many babies were in distress; but for a moment only; as we began  our counting, \"White Wings\" resumed, and the sun-bonnets outsang their  progeny. There was something quite singular in the way they had voted.  Here are some of the 3-year-old tickets: \"First choice, Ulysses Grant  Blum; 2d choice, Lewis Hendricks.\" \"First choice, James Redfield; 2d,  Lewis Hendricks.\" \"First, Elk Chester; 2d, Lewis Hendricks.\" \"Can  it be?\" said the excited Gadsden. \"Finish these quick. I'll open the  18-monthers.\" But he swung round to me at once. \"See there!\" he cried.  \"Read that! and that!\" He plunged among more, and I read: \"First choice,  Lawrence Nepton Ford, Jr.; 2d, Iona Judd.\" \"First choice, Mary Louise  Kenton; 2d, Iona Judd.\" \"Hurry up!\" said Gadsden; \"that's it!\" And as we  counted, Mrs. Brewton looked over my shoulder and uttered her melodious  croak, for which I saw no reason. \"That young whipper-snapper will go  far,\" she observed; nor did I understand this. But when they stopped the  band for me to announce the returns, one fact did dawn on me even  while I was reading: \"Three-year-olds: Whole number of votes cast, 300;  necessary to a choice, 225. Second prize, Lewis Hendricks, receiving  300. First prize, largest number of votes cast, 11, for Salvisa van  Meter. No award. Eighteen-month class: Whole number of votes cast, 300;  necessary to a choice, 225. Second prize, Iona Judd, receiving 300.  Lillian Brown gets 15 for 1st prize. None awarded.\" There was a very  feeble applause, and then silence for a second, and then the sun-bonnets  rushed together, rushed away to others, rushed back; and talk swept like  hail through the place. Yes, that is what they had done. They had all  voted for Lewis Hendricks and Iona Judd for second prize, and every  family had voted the first prize to its own baby. The Browns and van  Meters happened to be the largest families present. \"He'll go far! he'll  go far!\" repeated Mrs. Brewton. Sport glittered in her eye. She gathered  her curtains, and was among the sun-bonnets in a moment. Then it fully  dawned on me. The agent for Mrs. Eden's Manna in the Wilderness was  indeed a shrewd strategist, and knew his people to the roots of the  grass. They had never seen a baby-show. They were innocent. He came  among them. He gave away packages of manna and a diamond ring. He  offered the prizes. But he proposed to win some. Therefore he made that  rule about only the immediate families voting. He foresaw what they  would do; and now they had done it. Whatever happened, two prizes went  to his manna-feds. \"They don't see through it in the least, which is  just as well,\" said Mrs. Brewton, returning. \"And it's little matter  that only second prizes go to the best babies. But what's to be done  now?\" I had no idea; but it was not necessary that I should.    \"You folks of Rincon and Sharon,\" spoke a deep voice. It was the first  man in the Pullman, and drops were rolling from his forehead, and his  eyes were the eyes of a beleaguered ox. \"You fathers and mothers,\" he  said, and took another breath. They grew quiet. \"I'm a father myself,  as is well known.\" They applauded this. \"Salvisa is mine, and she got  my vote. The father that will not support his own child is not--does  not--is worse than if they were orphans.\" He breathed again, while they  loudly applauded. \"But, folks, I've got to get home to Rincon. I've  got to. And I'll give up Salvisa if I'm met fair.\" \"Yes, yes, you'll  be met,\" said voices of men. \"Well, here's my proposition: Mrs. Eden's  manna has took two, and I'm satisfied it should. We voted, and will stay  voted.\" \"Yes, yes!\" \"Well, now, here's Sharon and Rincon, two of the  finest towns in this section, and I say Sharon and Rincon has equal  rights to get something out of this, and drop private feelings, and  everybody back their town. And I say let this lady and gentleman, who  will act elegant and on the square, take a view and nominate the finest  Rincon 3-year-old and the finest Sharon 18-month they can cut out of the  herd. And I say let's vote unanimous on their pick, and let each town  hold a first prize and go home in friendship, feeling it has been  treated right.\"    Universal cheers endorsed him, and he got down panting. The band played  \"Union Forever,\" and I accompanied Mrs. Brewton to the booths. \"You'll  remember!\" shouted the orator urgently after us; \"one apiece.\" We  nodded. \"Don't get mixed,\" he appealingly insisted. We shook our heads,  and out of the booths rushed two women, and simultaneously dashed their  infants in our faces. \"You'll never pass Cuba by!\" entreated one. \"This  is Bosco Grady,\" said the other. Cuba wore an immense garment made of  the American flag, but her mother whirled her out of it in a second.  \"See them dimples; see them knees!\" she said. \"See them feet! Only feel  of her toes!\" \"Look at his arms!\" screamed the mother of Bosco. \"Doubled  his weight in four months.\" \"Did he indeed, ma'am?\" said Cuba's mother;  \"well, he hadn't much to double.\" \"Didn't he, then? Didn't he indeed?\"  \"No at you; he didn't indeed and indeed! I guess Cuba is known to  Sharon. I guess Sharon'll not let Cuba be slighted.\" \"Well, and I guess  Rincon'll see that Bosco Grady gets his rights.\" \"Ladies,\" said Mrs.  Brewton, towering but poetical with her curl, \"I am a mother myself, and  raised five noble boys and two sweet peerless girls.\" This stopped them  immediately; they stared at her and her chintz peonies as she put the  curl gently away from her medallion and proceeded: \"But never did I  think of myself in those dark weary days of the long ago. I thought of  my country and the Lost Cause.\" They stared at her, fascinated. \"Yes,  m'm,\" whispered they, quite humbly. \"Now,\" said Mrs. Brewton, \"what is  more sacred than an American mother's love? Therefore let her not shame  it with anger and strife. All little boys and girls are precious gems to  me and to you. What is a cold, lifeless medal compared to one of them?  Though I would that all could get the prize! But they can't, you know.\"  \"No, m'm.\" Many mothers, with their children in their arms, were now  dumbly watching Mrs. Brewton, who held them with a honeyed, convincing  smile. \"If I choose only one in this beautiful and encouraging harvest,  it is because I have no other choice. Thank you so much for letting  me see that little hero and that lovely angel,\" she added, with a yet  sweeter glance to"]]]
