For avoyding whereof and preventinge of the like in tyme  to come, May it please your most excellent Majestic ... that it may be  declared and enacted, and be it declared and enacted by the authoritie  of this present Parliament That all Monapolies and all Commissions  Graunts Licenses Charters and lettres patents heretofore made or  graunted, or hereafter to be made or graunted to any person or persons  Bodies Politique or Corporate whatsoever of or for the sole buyinge  sellinge makinge workinge or usinge of any things within this Realme  or the Dominion of Wales, or of any other Monopolies, or of Power  Libertie or Facultie to dispence with any others, or to give Licence  or Toleracon to doe use or exercise any thinge against the tenor or  purport of any Lawe or Statute ... are altogether contrary to the laws  of this realm and so are or shall be utterly void and in no wise to be  put in use or execution.\" Section 2 provides that all such monopolies  and the force and validity of them ought to be and should forever  hereafter be examined, tried, and determined by and according to  the common law; section 4, that a party aggrieved might have treble  damages, as in our modern Sherman Act. There followed provisos for  exempting existing patents for twenty-one years or less for new  inventions or like future patents for fourteen years or less, the  charters of the city of London, or any custom or customs of London, or  any other city or town, for corporations, companies, or fellowships of  any art, trade, occupation, or mystery; that is to say, exempting the  guilds, but these guilds by this time had long ceased to be societies  of actual journeymen or handicraftsmen. This great statute may fairly  be classed among the constitutional documents of England, and it left  the great fabric of the English common law guaranteeing freedom of  labor and liberty of trade, Magna Charta itself recognizing this  principle, and the Statute of Westminster I forbidding forestalling  and excessive toll contrary to the laws of England, as it has remained  until the present day--only rediscovered in the statutes of our  Southern and Western States aimed against trusts, and reapplied by  Congress, in the Sherman Act, to interstate commerce; but in neither  case added to, nor, possibly, improved.    Two years before this great statute, the process of impeachment, not  employed for nearly two hundred years, had been revived against Sir  Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell, who in the Parliament of  1621 were impeached \"for fraud and oppression committed as patentees  for the exclusive manufacture of gold and silver thread, for  the inspection of inns and hostelries, and for the licensing of  ale-houses. While no definite articles were presented according to  modern forms, an accusation was made by the Commons and a judgment  rendered by the Lords, condemning both to fine, imprisonment, and  degradation from the honor of knighthood.\" Nevertheless, Charles  I revived the system of monopolies and raised revenue by their  application to almost every article of ordinary consumption as well as  by enormous fines inflicted through the Star Chamber, both important  matters leading to his dethronement.[1] Elizabeth granted monopolies  on the perfectly madern pretence that a monopoly, be it made by law or  by tariff, is for the benefit of the public good, though at the same  time possibly a private profit to certain individuals, friends of the  sovereign.    [Footnote 1: See Dowell, \"History of Taxation,\" vol. I, pp. 204-209.]    But all this early legislation of England was far better and more  advanced than our own; for in all these questions of duties on exports  and duties on imports and monopolies, they never consider the man who  has the monopoly, the producer; but always they are avowed to  be, petitioned for, declared to be, only in the interests of the  _consumer_; which cannot be said to be the case with ourselves.          V    OTHER LEGISLATION IN MEDIAEVAL ENGLAND      (1275) The Statute of Westminster I has sometimes been termed a great  English code; it is certainly a comprehensive statement by statute of  a considerable portion of existing law. In our consideration of  labor and conspiracy laws we have had to include statutes of later  centuries. Now, returning to the year of the Statute of Westminster,  we found, in 1275, also the Statute of Bigamy, aimed against priests  with more than one wife. It is to be noted that this was centuries  before the celibacy of priests became one of the doctrines of the  Roman Catholic Church. It is also interesting that this early statute  refers to the pope as \"the Bishop of Rome\"--but only as printed since  1543.    (1279) The Statute of Mortmain, aimed at the holding of land in large  quantities by religious corporations, was a true constructive statute,  and the principle it establishes has grown ever since. The law  regards with jealousy the ownership of land by any corporation;  the presumption is against the power, and it extends to-day to all  corporations, and particularly to alien corporations (see chapter 7);  and in 1283 came the Statute of Acton Burnel, re-enacted in 1285 and  called the \"Statute Merchant,\" equally important. It provides for the  speedy recovery of debts due merchants, and is the foundation of all  our modern law of pledge, sales of collateral, etc. It is distinctly  an innovation on the common law; for in those days there was no method  of collecting ordinary money debts. You could levy on a man's land,  but there really seems to have been no method of recovering a debt  contracted in trade; and this is the first of many statutes adopting  foreign ideas as to matters of trade, and the customs of merchants,  drawn frequently from the Lombard or Jew traders of the Continent,  which, by statute law, custom, or court decision, has since become  such a considerable body of the English law as to have a name  to itself--the \"Law Merchant.\" This first statute provides for  imprisonment for debt; \"if he have no goods to be seized the debtor is  to be imprisoned, but the creditor shall find him bread and water.\"  A foreigner coming to England to recover a debt may also recover the  expenses of his trip; and the statute is further liberal in that it  does away with the _Droit d'Aubaine_, that narrow-minded custom by  which the goods or personal property of any person who died passing  through the kingdom were seized by the authorities and could not be  recovered by his heirs. This mediaeval injustice continued for some  centuries in Germany and France, and we can hardly say that the notion  is extinct in this country when a State like California, by her system  of public administrators, practically impounds a large proportion of  all personal property owned by non-residents at their death. Cases  have been known where it cost the executor more than one-third of  the money to collect a mortgage, owned by a deceased citizen of  Massachusetts, in California; and for that reason, among others,  Eastern lawyers have advised against investments in that State; for  the public administrators are usually petty politicians in search of a  job. The increasing burden of our State inheritance tax laws, whereby  every State wherein a corporation exists besides the State of the  deceased seizes its percentage of the stock of such corporation in the  hands of the executors, is another step in this direction. This early  Statute Merchant, liberal in other respects, still excludes Jews from  its benefits.    (1284) Jury trial was well established by this time, for the Statute  of Wales includes it in its code of procedure for that principality.  The great Statute _De Donis_, or Westminster II, came the following  year; most interesting to lawyers as the foundation of estates tail;  but it also regulates \"assizes or juries\" that \"rich men do not abide  at home by reason of their bribes.\" It also specifically requires  indictment \"of twelve lawful men at least,\" and gives an action  against sheriffs imprisoning without such warrant \"as they should have  against any other person.\" Rape, ten years before made punishable only  by two years' imprisonment, is now made an offence punishable by  loss of life or member; showing how our ancestors treated a burning  question, at least in our Southern States, of to-day. Finally, it  confirms and explains the writ _de odio et atia_, the predecessor of  the modern _habeas corpus_. Some writers have doubted whether this  writ existed as a practical remedy much before the Statute of Charles  II; but here it says that parties indicted, etc., are to have the writ  _de odio et atia_ \"lest they be kept long in prison, like as it is  declared in Magna Charta.\" This can only refer to C. 36 of John's  Charter, \"the writ of inquest of life or limb to be given gratis and  not denied\"; and taken in connection with the action for damages just  given affords a fairly complete safeguard to personal liberty. It also  contains the first game law, protecting \"salmons.\" \"There are salmons  in Wye,\" says Shakespeare, and we are reminded of it because the  Statute of Winchester in the same year contains a provision that is  almost literally quoted by Dogberry in \"Twelfth Night.\" It provides  for the gates of great towns to be shut at sunset, and that no citizen  should bear arms, and no tavern sell drink after 9 P.M., and then it  comes to the duties of the watch, which are described in such like  manner that Dogberry's language seems a mere paraphrase. Whoever wrote  the play certainly had read"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12238"],[0,"Science in the Kitchen (#20)"],[1," from the best white winter wheat is perhaps the best.  It may be used either sifted or unsifted, as preferred. The proportion  of flour and liquid to be used will necessarily vary somewhat with the  quality of the flour, but in general, three parts water to one of flour  will be needed. Too much flour not only makes the mush too thick, but  gives it an underdone taste. Stir the dried flour rapidly into boiling  water, (which should not cease to boil during the process), until a  thick porridge is obtained. It is well to have it a little thinner at  first than is desirable for serving, as it will thicken by cooking. Cook  slowly at least one hour. A longer time makes it more digestible.    Left-over Graham mush is nice spread on rather shallow tins, and simply  heated quickly in a hot oven.    GRAHAM MUSH NO. 2.--Moisten one pint of good Graham flour with a  pint of warm water, or enough to make a batter thin enough to pour. (The  quantity of water needed will vary a little with the fineness and  quality of the flour.) Pour this batter into a quart of water boiling in  the inner cup of a double boiler. Remember to add the batter  sufficiently slow, so as not to stop the boiling of the water. When  thickened, put into the outer boiler, and cook for one hour.    GRAHAM MUSH NO. 3.--Prepare in the same way as above, using milk or  part milk in the place of water. Left-over Graham mush at breakfast,  which has been prepared with water, is very nice if, while it is still  warm, a small quantity of hot milk is well stirred into it, and it is  then set by to be reheated in a double boiler for dinner.    GRAHAM MUSH WITH DATES.--Prepare a mush as for Graham mush No. 2.  When done, place in the dish in which the mush is to be served, some  nice, fresh dates from which the stones have been removed. Pour the mush  over them, and stir up lightly, taking care not to break the fruit, and  serve. Raisins previously steamed, or figs steamed and cut into pieces,  may be used instead of dates. Serve hot with cream, or mold, and serve  cold.    PLUM PORRIDGE.--Prepare a Graham mush as previously directed, and  when done, add to it a cup of well-steamed raisins and sufficient rich  milk to thin it to the consistency of porridge.    GRAHAM APPLE MUSH.--Prepare a smooth apple sauce of rather tart  apples. Sweeten it slightly, and thin with boiling water. Have this  mixture boiling, and add to it Graham flour, either sprinkled in dry or  moistened with water, sufficient to make a well-thickened mush. Cook,  and serve hot with cream.    GRANOLA MUSH.--Granola, a cooked preparation of wheat and oats,  manufactured by the Sanatarium Food Co., makes a most appetizing and  quickly prepared breakfast dish. Into a quart of boiling water sprinkle  a pint of granola. Cook for two or three minutes, and serve hot with  cream.    GRANOLA FRUIT MUSH.--Prepare the mush as directed, and stir into  it, when done, a large cupful of nicely-steamed, seedless raisins. Serve  hot with cream. Milk may be used instead of water, if preferred.    GRANOLA PEACH MUSH.--Instead of the raisins as directed in the  foregoing recipe, add to the mush, when done, a pint of sliced yellow  peaches. Finely-cut, mellow sweet apples, sliced bananas, and  blueberries may be used in a similar way.    BRAN JELLY.--Select some clean wheat bran, sprinkle it slowly into  boiling water as for Graham mush, stirring briskly meanwhile with a  wooden spoon, until the whole is about the consistency of thick gruel.  Cook slowly in a double boiler for two hours. Strain through a fine wire  sieve placed over the top of a basin. When strained, reheat to boiling.  Then stir into it a spoonful or so of sifted Graham flour, rubbed smooth  in a little cold water. Boil up once; turn into molds previously wet in  cold water, and when cool, serve with cream or fruit juice.      THE OAT, OR AVENA.    DESCRIPTION.--The native country of the plant from which our common  varieties of the oat are derived, is unknown. Oat grains have been found  among the remains of the lake-dwellers in Switzerland, and it is  probable that this plant was cultivated by the prehistoric inhabitants  of Central Europe.    The ancient Greeks and Romans used oats, ranking them next in value to  barley, which they esteemed above all other cereals. Although  principally grown as food for horses, the oat, when divested of its husk  and broken by a process of milling, is an exceedingly nutritious and  valuable article of diet for human beings; and there is no article of  food that has increased in general favor more rapidly in the last few  years than this grain.    The Scotch have long been famed for their large consumption of oatmeal.  It forms the staple article of diet for the peasantry, to which fact is  generally attributed the fine physique and uniform health for which  they, as a race, are particularly noted. It is related that Dr. Johnson,  of dictionary fame, who never lost an opportunity to disparage the  Scotch, on one occasion defined oats as, \"In Scotland, food for men; in  England, food for horses.\" He was well answered by an indignant  Scotchman who replied, \"Yes; and where can you find such fine men as in  Scotland, or such horses as in England?\"    Oatmeal justly ranks high as an alimentary substance. It contains about  the same proportion of nitrogenous elements as wheat, and with the  exception of maize, is richer in fatty matter than any other of the  cultivated cereals. In general structure the oat resembles wheat.    To prepare oats for food, the husk, which is wholly indigestible in  character, must be thoroughly removed. To accomplish this, the grain is  first kiln-dried to loosen the husk, and afterward submitted to a  process of milling. Denuded of its integument, the nutritive part of the  grain is termed groats; broken into finer particles, it constitutes what  is known as oatmeal; rolled oats, or avena, is prepared by a process  which crushes the kernels. Oatmeal varies also in degrees of  trituration, some kinds being ground much finer than others. The more  finely-ground products are sometimes adulterated with barley meal, which  is cheaper than oatmeal and less nutritious. The black specks which are  sometimes found in oatmeal are particles of black oats which have been  ground in connection with the other.    Oatmeal lacks the tenacity of wheaten flour, and cannot, without the  addition of some other flour, be made into light bread. It is, however,  largely consumed by the inhabitants of Scotland and the north of  England, in the form of oatcakes. The oatmeal is mixed with water,  kneaded thoroughly, then rolled into very thin cakes, and baked on an  iron plate or griddle suspended over a fire. So much, however, depends  upon the kneading, that it is said that the common inquiry before the  engagement of a domestic servant in Scotland, is whether or not she is a  good kneader of oatcakes.    The most common use of oatmeal in this country is in the form of mush or  porridge. For this the coarser grades of meal are preferable. For people  in health, there is no more wholesome article of diet than oatmeal  cooked in this way and eaten with milk. For growing children, it is one  of the best of foods, containing, as it does, a large proportion of bone  and muscle-forming material, while to almost all persons who have become  accustomed to its use, it is extremely palatable. The time required for  its digestion is somewhat longer than that of wheaten meal prepared in  the same manner. It is apt to disagree with certain classes of  dyspeptics, having a tendency to produce acidity, though it is  serviceable as an article of diet in some forms of indigestion. The  manner of its preparation for the table has very much to do with its  wholesomeness. Indeed, many objectionable dishes are prepared from it.  One of these, called _brose_, much used in Scotland, is made by simply  stirring oatmeal into some hot liquid, as beef broth, or the water in  which a vegetable has been boiled. The result is a coarse, pasty mass of  almost raw oatmeal, an extremely indigestible compound, the use of which  causes water brash. A preparation called _sowens_, or flummery, made by  macerating the husks of the oats in water from twenty-four to thirty-six  hours, until the mixture ferments, then boiling down to the consistency  of gruel, is a popular article of food among the Scotch and Welsh  peasantry. When boiled down still more, so it will form a firm jelly  when cold, the preparation is called _budrum_.    PREPARATION AND COOKING.--Oatmeal requires much cooking in order to  break its starch cells; and the coarser the meal, the longer it should  be allowed to cook. A common fault in the use of oatmeal is that it is  served in an underdone state, which makes a coarse, indigestible dish of  what, with more lengthy preparation, would be an agreeable and  nutritious food. Like most of the grains, it is best put into boiling  soft water, and allowed to cook continuously and slowly. It is greatly  injured by stirring, and it is therefore preferably cooked in a double  boiler or closed steamer. If it is necessary to use an ordinary kettle,  place it on some part of the range where the contents will only simmer;  or a hot brick may be placed under it to keep it from cooking too fast.  It may be cooked the day previous, and warmed for use the same as other  grains.      RECIPES.    OATMEAL MUSH.--Heat a quart of water to boiling in the inner dish  of a double boiler, sift into it one cup of coarse oatmeal, and boil  rapidly, stirring continuously until it sets; then place in the outer  boiler, the water in which should be boiling, and cook three hours or  longer. Serve with cream.    OATMEAL FRUIT MUSH.--Prepare the oatmeal as directed above, and  stir in lightly, when dishing for the table, some sliced mellow and  juicy raw sweet apples. Strawberry apples and other slightly tart apples  are likewise excellent for the purpose. "]]]
