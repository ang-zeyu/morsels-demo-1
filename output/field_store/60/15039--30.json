They have chased and killed the jugi.\"      So the two dogs built the pyre and lay the body on it. Then she  ordered them to split more wood, singing:--          \"Cut the wood, Rauta and Paika!      Alas! The dogs have bitten the Jugi,      Alas! They have chased and killed the jugi.\"      So they split more wood and then she told them to apply the fire,  singing:--          \"Light the fire, Rauta and Paika!      Alas! The dogs have bitten the Jugi,      Alas! they have chased and killed the jugi.\"      When the pyre was in full blaze she suddenly said to the dogs \"Look up,  Rauta and Paika, see the stars are shining in the day time.\" When the  two dogs looked up, she threw the salt into their eyes, and, while  they were blinded, she sprang into the flames and died as a _sati_  on the body of her husband.          XXVIII. The Wife Who Would Not Be Beaten.    There was once a Raja's son who announced that he would marry no woman  who would not allow him to beat her every morning and evening. The  Raja's servants hunted high and low in vain for a bride who would  consent to these terms, at long last, they found a maiden who agreed  to be beaten morning and evening if the prince would marry her. So  the wedding took place and for two or three days the prince hesitated  to begin the beating; but one morning he got up and, taking a stick  from the corner, went to his bride and told her that she must have  her beating. \"Wait a minute\" said she \"there is one thing I want to  point out to you before you beat me. It is only on the strength of  your father's position that you play the fine gentleman like this:  your wealth is all your father's and it is on his wealth that you  are relying. When you have earned something for yourself, and made  a position for yourself, then I am willing that you should beat me  and not before.\"    The prince saw that what his bride said was true and held his  hand. Then, in order to earn wealth for himself, he set out on a  trading expedition, taking quantities of merchandise loaded in sacks;  and he had a large band of retainers with him, mounted on horses and  elephants, and altogether made a fine show. The princess sent one of  her own servants with the prince and gave him secret instructions  to watch his opportunity and if ever, when the prince was bathing,  he should throw away a loin cloth, to take possession of it without  the prince knowing anything about it and bring it to her. The prince  journeyed on till he came to the country called Lutia.    The Raja of Lutia was walking on the roof of his palace and he saw  the cavalcade approaching, and he sent a _sipahi_ to meet the prince  and ask him this question, \"Have you the secret of prosperity for ever  or of prosperity for a day?\" When this question was put to the prince  he answered that he had the secret of prosperity for ever. When the  Lutia Raja was told of this answer, he ordered his men to stop the  prince's train; so they surrounded them and seized all the merchandise  and the prince's retainers fled on their horses and elephants and  left him alone and penniless. In his distress the prince was forced  to take service with a rich Hindu, and he had nothing to live on but  what his master chose to give him, and all he had to wear was a loin  cloth like the poorest labourer.    The only man who did not desert him was the servant whom the Princess  had sent; and one day he saw that the prince had thrown away an old  loin cloth while bathing; this he picked up and took home to his  mistress, who put it away. When she heard all that had happened to  her husband, she set out in her turn to the Lutia country and all  she took with her was a mouse and a shawl. When she reached the Lutia  country the Raja as before sent a messenger to ask whether she knew  the secret of prosperity for ever or of prosperity for a day.    She answered \"prosperity for a day.\" Thereupon the Raja had her sent  for and also all the retainers who had deserted the Prince and who  had collected together in the neighbourhood. When they had all come  the Raja said that he would now decide who should have all the wealth  which had been taken from the prince: he produced a cat and said that  the person towards whom the cat jumped should have all the wealth. So  they all sat round the Raja and the Princess had her mouse hidden  under her shawl and every now and then she kept uncovering its head  and covering it up again. The cat soon caught sight of the mouse and,  when the Raja let it go, it jumped straight to the Princess in hopes  of catching the mouse. The Raja at once adjudged all the merchandise  to her, and she loaded it on the horses and elephants and took it  home accompanied by her husband's retainers.    A few days afterwards her husband came home, having got tired of  working as a servant, and, putting a bold face on it, he went up to  her and said that now he was going to beat her; all the retainers who  had accompanied him when he set out to trade and also the servant whom  the princess had sent with him were present. Then, before them all,  the princess took up the old loin cloth and asked him if he knew to  whom it had belonged; at this reminder of his poverty the prince was  dumb with shame. \"Ask your retainers\" continued the princess \"to whom  all the merchandise with which you set out now rightfully belongs,  ask them whether it is yours or mine, and then say whether you will  beat me.\"    The prince had no answer to give her and after this lesson gave up  all idea of beating his bride.          XXIX. Sahde Goala.    Once a marriage was arranged between Sahde Goala and Princess Chandaini  and on the wedding day when it began to get dusk Sahde Goala ordered  the sun to stand still. \"How,\" said he, \"can the people see the  wedding of a mighty man like myself in the dark?\" So at his behest  the sun delayed its setting for an hour, and the great crowd which  had assembled saw all the grand ceremonies.    The next day Sahde and his bride set off home and it took them three  days to reach the place where he lived. Before they left they had  invited the princess's father to come and see them; accordingly a day  or two later he set out, but it took him three months to accomplish the  distance which Sahde Goala had traversed in three days. When the old  Raja reached his son-in-law's house they welcomed him and washed his  feet and offered him refreshments; and when he had eaten, he asked his  son-in-law to take him out for a stroll. So they went out, Sahde Goala  in front and the old Raja following behind him and as they walked Sahde  Goala struck his foot against a stone, and the stone was shattered to  pieces. When the Raja saw this proof of his son-in-law's superhuman  strength, he became alarmed for his daughter's safety. If Sahde ever  lost his temper with her he might clearly smash her to atoms, so he  made up his mind that he could not leave her in such keeping. When  he told his daughter what he had seen she was as frightened as her  father and begged him to take her home, so they agreed to escape  together some time when Sahde Goala was out of the way.    One morning Sahde Goala went out to watch his men working in the  fields and the old Raja and his daughter seized this opportunity to  escape. Sahde Goala had a sister named Lorokini and she ran to the  field to tell her brother that his wife was running away. \"Let her go\"  said Sahde Goala. The old Raja travelled faster than his daughter and  left her behind and as she travelled along alone Sahde Goala made a  flooded river flow across her path. It was quite unfordable so the  Princess stood on the bank and sang:--          \"My mother gave me birth,      My father gave me in marriage:      If the water upstream would stand still      And the water downstream would flow away      Then I could go and live in my own home.\"      But no such thing happened and she had to go back to her husband's  house.    When she arrived her mother-in-law gave her a large basket of cooked  rice and a pot of relish and told her to take them to the labourers  in the field. Her mother-in-law helped her to lift the basket on to  her head and she set off. When she reached the field she called to  her sister-in-law:--          \"Come Lorokini,      Lift down from my head      The basket of rice      And the pot of relish.\"      But Lorokini was angry with her for trying to run  away and refused to help, singing:--          \"I will not come      I will not lift down the basket:      Prop it against a _murup_ tree:      I will not lift it down.\"      Then Chandaini Rani propped it against the trunk of a _murup_ tree,  and so set it on the ground.    Then she sang to her husband:--          \"Here, husband, is the lota of water:      Here, husband, is the tooth stick;      Come, and wash your hands:      If you are angry with me      Take me back to my father and mother.\"      But Sahde Goala was ploughing at the head of his men and paid no  attention to her: then she sang again:--          \"Seven hundred labourers      And twenty hundred women labourers,      You are causing to die of thirst.\"      But still Sahde Goala paid no attention. Then Chandaini Rani got  angry and by leaning the basket against the _murup_ tree managed to  get it on to her head again and carried it home, and from that time  murup trees grow slanting. Directly she had taken the rice and relish  to the house she set off again to run away to her mother. As before  Sahde Goala caused a flooded river to flow across her path and as  before she sang:--          \"My mother gave me birth,      My father gave me in marriage:      If the water upstream would stand still      And the water downstream would flow away      Then I could go and live in my own home,\"      And this time the water did stand still and the water below all  flowed away and she crossed over. As she crossed she said \"If I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"ian, lost no time in abandoning, wisely no doubt,  a portion.  Hadrian, adopted by Trajan, and a Spaniard too, was  intellectually superior and morally very inferior to him.  He was full  of ambition, vanity, invention, and restlessness; he was sceptical in  thought and cynical in manners; and he was overflowing with political,  philosophical, and literary views and pretensions.  He passed the  twenty-one years of his reign chiefly in travelling about the empire,  in Asia, Africa, Greece, Spain, Gaul, and Great Britain, opening roads,  raising ramparts and monuments, founding schools of learning and museums,  and encouraging among the provinces, as well as at Rome, the march of  administration, legislation, and intellect, more for his own pleasure and  his own glorification than in the interest of his country and of society.  At the close of this active career, when he was ill and felt that he was  dying, he did the best deed of his life.  He had proved, in the discharge  of high offices, the calm and clear-sighted wisdom of Titus Antoninus, a  Gaul, whose family came originally from Nimes; he had seen him one day  coming to the senate and respectfully supporting the tottering steps of  his aged father (or father-in-law, according to Aurelius Victor); and he  adopted him as his successor.  Antoninus Pius, as a civilian, was just  what Trajan had been as a warrior--moral and modest; just and frugal;  attentive to the public weal; gentle towards individuals; full of respect  for laws and rights; scrupulous in justifying his deeds before the senate  and making them known to the populations by carefully posted edicts; and  more anxious to do no wrong or harm to anybody than to gain lustre from  brilliant or popular deeds.  \"He surpasses all men in goodness,\" said his  contemporaries, and he conferred on the empire the best of gifts, for he  gave it Marcus Aurelius for its ruler.    It has been said that Marcus Aurelius was philosophy enthroned.  Without  any desire to contest or detract from that compliment, let it be added  that he was conscientiousness enthroned.  It is his grand and original  characteristic that he governed the Roman empire and himself with a  constant moral solicitude, ever anxious to realize that ideal of personal  virtue and general justice which he had conceived, and to which he  aspired.  His conception, indeed, of virtue and justice was incomplete,  and even false in certain cases; and in more than one instance, such as  the persecution of the Christians, he committed acts quite contrary to  the moral law which he intended to put in practice towards all men; but  his respect for the moral law was profound, and his intention to shape  his acts according to it, serious and sincere.  Let us cull a few phrases  from that collection of his private thoughts, which he entitled _For  Self,_ and which is really the most faithful picture man ever left of  himself and the pains he took with himself.  \"There is,\" says he,  \"relationship between all beings endowed with reason.  The world is like  a superior city within which the other cities are but families.  .  .  .  I have conceived the idea of a government founded on laws of general and  equal application.  Beware lest thou Caesarze thyself, for it is what  happens only too often.  Keep thyself simple, good, unaltered, worthy,  grave, a friend to justice, pious, kindly disposed, courageous enough for  any duty.  .  .  .  Reverence the gods, preserve mankind.  Life is short;  the only possible good fruit of our earthly existence is holiness of  intention and deeds that tend to the common weal.  .  .  .  My soul, be  thou covered with shame!  Thy life is well nigh gone, and thou hast not  yet learned how to live.\"  Amongst men who have ruled great states, it is  not easy to mention more than two, Marcus Aurelius and Saint Louis, who  have been thus passionately concerned about the moral condition of their  souls and the moral conduct of their lives.  The mind of Marcus Aurelius  was superior to that of Saint Louis; but Saint Louis was a Christian, and  his moral ideal was more pure, more complete, more satisfying, and more  strengthening for the soul than the philosophical ideal of Marcus  Aurelius.  And so Saint Louis was serene and confident as to his fate and  that of the human race, whilst Marcus Aurelius was disquieted and sad--  sad for himself and also for humanity, for his country and for his times:  \"O, my sole,\" was his cry, \"wherefore art thou troubled, and why am I so  vexed?\"    We are here brought closer to the fact which has already been  foreshadowed, and which characterizes the moral and social condition of  the Roman world at this period.  It would be a great error to take the  five emperors just spoken of--Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and  Marcus Aurelius--as representatives of the society amidst which they  lived, and as giving in a certain degree the measure of its  enlightenment, its morality, its prosperity, its disposition, and  condition in general.  Those five princes were not only picked men,  superior in mind and character to the majority of their contemporaries,  but they were men almost isolated in their generation; in them there was  a resumption of all that had been acquired by Greek and Roman antiquity  of enlightenment and virtue, practical wisdom and philosophical morality:  they were the heirs and the survivors of the great minds and the great  politicians of Athens and Rome, of the Areopagus and the Senate.  They  were not in intellectual and moral harmony with the society they  governed, and their action upon it served hardly to preserve it partially  and temporarily from the evils to which it was committed by its own vices  and to break its fall.  When they were thoughtful and modest as Marcus  Aurelius was, they were gloomy and disposed to discouragement, for they  had a secret foreboding of the uselessness of their efforts.    Nor was their gloom groundless: in spite of their honest plans and  of brilliant appearances, the degradation, material as well as moral,  of Roman society went on increasing.  The wars, the luxury, the  dilapidations, and the disturbances of the empire always raised its  expenses much above its receipts.  The rough miserliness of Vespasian and  the wise economy of Antoninus Pius were far from sufficient to restore  the balance; the aggravation of imposts was incessant; and the  population, especially the agricultural population, dwindled away more  and more, in Italy itself, the centre of the state.  This evil disquieted  the emperors, when they were neither idiots nor madmen; Claudius,  Vespasian, Nerva, and Trajan labored to supply a remedy, and Augustus  himself had set them the example.  They established in Italy colonies of  veterans to whom they assigned lands; they made gifts thereof to indigent  Roman citizens; they attracted by the title of senator rich citizens from  the provinces, and when they had once installed them as landholders in  Italy, they did not permit them to depart without authorization.  Trajan  decreed that every candidate for the Roman magistracies should be bound  to have a third of his fortune invested in Italian land, \"in order,\" says  Pliny the Younger, \"that those who sought the public dignities should  regard Rome and Italy not as an inn to put up at in travelling, but as  their home.\"  And Pliny the Elder, going as a philosophical observer to  the very root of the evil, says, in his pompous manner, \"In former times  our generals tilled their fields with their own hands; the earth, we may  suppose, opened graciously beneath a plough crowned with laurels and held  by triumphal hands, maybe because those great men gave to tillage the  same care that they gave to war, and that they sowed seed with the same  attention with which they pitched a camp; or maybe, also, because  everything fructifies best in honorable hands, because everything is done  with the most scrupulous exactitude.  .  .  .  Nowadays these same fields  are given over to slaves in chains, to malefactors who are condemned to  penal servitude, and on whose brow there is a brand.  Earth is not deaf  to our prayers; we give her the name of mother; culture is what we call  the pains we bestow on her .  .  .  but can we be surprised if she render  not to slaves the recompense she paid to generals?\"    What must have been the decay of population and of agriculture in the  provinces, when even in Italy there was need of such strong protective  efforts, which were nevertheless so slightly successful?    Pliny had seen what was the fatal canker of the Roman empire in the  country as well as in the towns: slavery or semi-slavery.    Landed property was overwhelmed with taxes, was subject to conditions  which branded it with a sort of servitude, and was cultivated by a  servile population, in whose hands it became almost barren.  The large  holders were thus disgusted, and the small ruined or reduced to a  condition more and more degraded.  Add to this state of things in the  civil department a complete absence of freedom and vitality in the  political; no elections, no discussion, no public responsibility;  characters weakened by indolence and silence, or destroyed by despotic  power, or corrupted by the intrigues of court or army.  Take a step  farther; cast a glance over the moral department; no religious creeds and  nothing left of even Paganism but its festivals and frivolous or shameful  superstitions.  The philosophy of Greece and the old Roman manner of life  had raised up, it is true, in the higher ranks of society Stoics and  jurists, the former the last champions of morality and the dignity of  human nature, the latter the last enlightened servants of the civil  community.  But neither the doctrines of the Stoics nor the science and  able reasoning of the jurists were lights and guides within the reach and  for the use of the populace, who remained a prey to the vices"]]]
