For because a man is alone, he  is not for that reason also solitary; just as though a man is among  numbers, he is not therefore not solitary. When then we have lost either  a brother, or a son, or a friend on whom we were accustomed to repose,  we say that we are left solitary, though we are often in Rome, though  such a crowd meet us, though so many live in the same place, and  sometimes we have a great number of slaves. For the man who is solitary,  as it is conceived, is considered to be a helpless person and exposed to  those who wish to harm him. For this reason when we travel, then  especially do we say that we are lonely when we fall among robbers, for  it is not the sight of a human creature which removes us from solitude,  but the sight of one who is faithful and modest and helpful to us. For  if being alone is enough to make solitude, you may say that even Zeus is  solitary in the conflagration and bewails himself saying, Unhappy that I  am who have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son,  nor descendant, nor kinsman. This is what some say that he does when he  is alone at the conflagration. For they do not understand how a man  passes his life when he is alone, because they set out from a certain  natural principle, from the natural desire of community and mutual love  and from the pleasure of conversation among men. But none the less a man  ought to be prepared in a manner for this also (being alone), to be able  to be sufficient for himself and to be his own companion. For as Zeus  dwells with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and thinks of his own  administration and of its nature, and is employed in thoughts suitable  to himself; so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves, not to  feel the want of others also, not to be unprovided with the means of  passing our time; to observe the divine administration, and the relation  of ourselves to everything else; to consider how we formerly were  affected towards things that happened and how at present; what are still  the things which give us pain; how these also can be cured and how  removed; if any things require improvement, to improve them according to  reason.    Well then, if some man should come upon me when I am alone and murder  me? Fool, not murder You, but your poor body.    What kind of solitude then remains? what want? why do we make ourselves  worse than children; and what do children do when they are left alone?  They take up shells and ashes, and they build something, then pull it  down, and build something else, and so they never want the means of  passing the time. Shall I then, if you sail away, sit down and weep,  because I have been left alone and solitary? Shall I then have no  shells, no ashes? But children do what they do through want of thought  (or deficiency in knowledge), and we through knowledge are unhappy.    Every great power (faculty) is dangerous to beginners. You must then  bear such things as you are able, but conformably to nature: but not ...  Practise sometimes a way of living like a person out of health that you  may at some time live like a man in health.           *       *       *       *       *    CERTAIN MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.--As bad tragic actors cannot sing alone,  but in company with many, so some persons cannot walk about alone. Man,  if you are anything, both walk alone and talk to yourself, and do not  hide yourself in the chorus. Examine a little at last, look around, stir  yourself up, that you may know who you are.    You must root out of men these two things, arrogance (pride) and  distrust. Arrogance then is the opinion that you want nothing (are  deficient in nothing); but distrust is the opinion that you cannot be  happy when so many circumstances surround you. Arrogance is removed by  confutation; and Socrates was the first who practised this. And (to  know) that the thing is not impossible inquire and seek. This search  will do you no harm; and in a manner this is philosophizing, to seek how  it is possible to employ desire and aversion ([Greek: echchlisis])  without impediment.    I am superior to you, for my father is a man of consular rank. Another  says, I have been a tribune, but you have not. If we were horses, would  you say, My father was swifter? I have much barley and fodder, or  elegant neck ornaments. If then you were saying this, I said, Be it so:  let us run then. Well, is there nothing in a man such as running in a  horse, by which it will be known which is superior and inferior? Is  there not modesty ([Greek: aidos]), fidelity, justice? Show yourself  superior in these, that you may be superior as a man. If you tell me  that you can kick violently, I also will say to you, that you are proud  of that which is the act of an ass.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WE OUGHT TO PROCEED WITH CIRCUMSPECTION TO EVERYTHING.[Footnote:  Compare Encheiridion, 29.]--In every act consider what precedes and what  follows, and then proceed to the act. If you do not consider, you will  at first begin with spirit, since you have not thought at all of the  things which follow; but afterwards when some consequences have shown  themselves, you will basely desist (from that which you have begun).--I  wish to conquer at the Olympic games.--(And I too, by the gods; for it  is a fine thing.) But consider here what precedes and what follows; and  then, if it is for your good, undertake the thing. You must act  according to rules, follow strict diet, abstain from delicacies,  exercise yourself by compulsion at fixed times, in heat, in cold; drink  no cold water, nor wine, when there is opportunity of drinking it. In a  word, you must surrender yourself to the trainer, as you do to a  physician. Next in the contest, you must be covered with sand, sometimes  dislocate a hand, sprain an ankle, swallow a quantity of dust, be  scourged with the whip; and after undergoing all this, you must  sometimes be conquered. After reckoning all these things, if you have  still an inclination, go to the athletic practice. If you do not reckon  them, observe you will behave like children who at one time play as  wrestlers, then as gladiators, then blow a trumpet, then act a tragedy,  when they have seen and admired such things. So you also do: you are at  one time a wrestler (athlete), then a gladiator, then a philosopher,  then a rhetorician; but with your whole soul you are nothing: like the  ape you imitate all that you see; and always one thing after another  pleases you, but that which becomes familiar displeases you. For you  have never undertaken anything after consideration, nor after having  explored the whole matter and put it to a strict examination; but you  have undertaken it at hazard and with a cold desire. Thus some persons  having seen a philosopher and having heard one speak like Euphrates--and  yet who can speak like him?--wish to be philosophers themselves.    Man, consider first what the matter is (which you propose to do), then  your own nature also, what it is able to bear. If you are a wrestler,  look at your shoulders, your thighs, your loins: for different men are  naturally formed for different things. Do you think that, if you do  (what you are doing daily), you can be a philosopher? Do you think that  you can eat as you do now, drink as you do now, and in the same way be  angry and out of humor? You must watch, labor, conquer certain desires,  you must depart from your kinsmen, be despised by your slaves, laughed  at by those who meet you, in everything you must be in an inferior  condition, as to magisterial office, in honors, in courts of justice.  When you have considered all these things completely, then, if you think  proper, approach to philosophy, if you would gain in exchange for these  things freedom from perturbations, liberty, tranquillity. If you have  not considered these things, do not approach philosophy: do not act like  children, at one time a philosopher, then a tax collector, then a  rhetorician, then a procurator (officer) of Caesar. These things are not  consistent. You must be one man either good or bad; you must either  labor at your own ruling faculty or at external things; you must either  labor at things within or at external things; that is, you must either  occupy the place of a philosopher or that of one of the vulgar.    A person said to Rufus when Galba was murdered: Is the world now  governed by Providence? But Rufus replied: Did I ever incidentally form  an argument from Galba that the world is governed by Providence?           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WE OUGHT WITH CAUTION TO ENTER INTO FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITH  MEN.--If a man has frequent intercourse with others either for talk, or  drinking together, or generally for social purposes, he must either  become like them, or change them to his own fashion. For if a man places  a piece of quenched charcoal close to a piece that is burning, either  the quenched charcoal will quench the other, or the burning charcoal  will light that which is quenched. Since then the danger is so great, we  must cautiously enter into such intimacies with those of the common  sort, and remember that it is impossible that a man can keep company  with one who is covered with soot without being partaker of the soot  himself. For what will you do if a man speaks about gladiators, about  horses, about athletes, or what is worse about men? Such a person is  bad, such a person is good; this was well done, this was done badly.  Further, if he scoff, or ridicule, or show an ill-natured disposition?  Is any man among us prepared like a lute-player when he takes a lute, so  that as soon as he has touched the strings, he discovers which are  discordant, and tunes the instrument?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#20)"],[1," I come to the succour  of that Maid afar in the darkness of the World, or meet my death proper,  as it might need to be.    And thus did I go forward steadfastly, and conscious in all my being of  the emotions of that parting from my mighty Home, and of the tenderness  and wiseness that did underlie so much curbed rule and guidance.    And my heart was warm towards the Master Monstruwacan for that great  honour, that he should come downward in armour to make one with the Full  Watch, that he might uphold me to a lofty spirit at the moment of my  going.    And all that time as I went forward, was the aether of the night about  me, in tumult with the thoughts and blind wishings of the great millions  I had but now left to my back.    And, presently, as I steadied somewhat upon my emotions, I was conscious  of the exceeding coldness of the night air, and of the different taste  of it upon my lungs and in the mouth; and it had, as it were, a wondrous  keen sharping upon my palate, and did fill the lips more in the  breathing; so that it may be supposed it had more body within it than  that air which did fill the plateau of the Thousandth City where was my  home; for the air of every City was of difference, and the greater  between one that was afar up and another nigh to the earth, as may be  thought; so that many Peoples did migrate unto that level which gave  them best healthfulness; but under rule, and with a guidance of  quantities. And not all that were lacking of health; for, some are ever  contrary.    And here let me set down that, within the deeps of the Fields, there was  air utter varied and wonderful, that might charm one here and likewise  sorrow another that were happier elsewhere; so that all might have  suiting, did they but wander, and have Reason to companion them.    And thus did I go forward, full of new thoughts and olden memories, and  fresh-breaking wonders; neither forgetting something of doubts and fears  more than a little. And again was it most cunning strange to be out  there in the Night Land--though not yet afar--where often had my fancies  and imaginings led me; yet until that time never had I touched foot, in  all that life, upon the outward earth. And this must be a wondrous  quaint seeming thought to those of this present day.    And so came I, at last, nigh to the Circle that did go about the  Redoubt; and presently I was come to it; and something astonished was I  that it had no great bigness; for I had looked for this by _reasoning_;  having always a mind to picture things as they might be truly, and hence  coming sometimes to the wonder of a great truth; but odd whiles to  errors that others had not made. And now, lo! I did find it but a small,  clear tube that had not two inches of thickness; yet sent out a very  bright and strong light, so that it seemed greater to the eye, did one  but behold from a distance.    And this is but a little thing to set to the telling; yet may it give  something of the newness of all; and, moreover, shall you have memory  with me in this place, how that oft had I seen Things and Beast-Monsters  peer over that same little tube of light, their faces coming forward out  of the night.    And this had I seen as child and man; for as children, we did use to  keep oft a watch by hours upon an holiday-time, through the great  glasses of the embrasures. And we did always hope each to be that one  that should first discover a monster looking inwards upon the Mighty  Pyramid, across the shining of the Circle. And these to come oft; yet  presently to slink away into the night; having, in verity, no liking for  that light.    And pride had we taken of ourselves to perceive those monsters which had  most of ugliness and horror to commend them; for, thereby did we stand  to have won the game of watching, until such time as a more fearsome  Brute be discovered. And so went the play; yet with ever, it doth seem  to me now, something of a half-known shudder to the heart, and a child's  rejoicing unknowingly in that safety which had power to make light the  seeming of such matters.    And this, also, is but a small matter; yet doth it bear upon the  inwardness of my feelings; for the memories of all my youth and of the  many Beasts that I had seen to peer across the Light, did come upwards  in my mind in that moment; so that I did give back a little, unthinking  of what I did; but having upon me the sudden imagining of that which  might come out of the Dark, beyond.    And I to stand a little moment, and presently had grown free in my heart  to have courage of farewell; and so did turn me at last to the viewing  of that wondrous Home of the Last Millions of this World. And the sight  was an astonishment and an uplifting, that indeed there was so mighty a  thing in all the earth.    And well might be that there were Monsters and Forces gathered together  about that Hill of Life, out of all the Darkness of the World; for the  thing was as a Mighty Mountain that went up measureless into the night;  and spread out upon the earth to the right and to the left of me, so  that it did seem to hold all the world with its might.    And in the nearer slope were there three hundred thousand great  embrasures, as well I did know; there being in all the four sides of the  Redoubt, twelve hundred thousand embrasures, as was set out in the books  of the schools, and upon the cover of Atlas-books as they still quaintly  to be called, and many another place, as might be supposed.    And half a mile upward was the lowest tier of those great window-places,  and above that, countless other tiers. And a great light came out from  them into the darkness; so that I looked up into the night many miles,  and yet did see them in shining rows; and did make separate each  embrasure from its fellow for a great way. But there grew yet more,  above in the mighty distance, so that they were lost in the upward space  of the night, and did seem to me presently but as a constant, glimmering  fire, that did shape a shining Peak into the blackness of the heavens,  dwindling into the utmost height. And thus was that Everlasting  Monument.    Then did it come to me that those little things, which I did see to  cluster against the embrasures, were in truth the countless millions of  the Mighty Redoubt; and this I could make out with some plainness in  those lower embrasures, which were the more near to me than they above;  for the Peoples were set against the light within, yet were as small  things like unto insects, in that distance, and within so Huge a Bulk.    And I knew that they looked out upon me, and did watch through their  spy-glasses. And I sent my gaze upwards again along that great Slope of  grey metal, aye! upward again to where it strode glimmering into the  Blackness, and so at last to the little star that did crown that Wonder  of the World in the eternal night. And, for a little, I did stare  towards that far light; for it came from within that Tower of  Observation, where so lately I had spended my life; and I had knowledge  within my heart that the dear Master Monstruwacan did bend the Great  Spy-Glass upon me, through which so oft had I spied. And I raised the  Diskos unto him, in salutation and farewell, though I saw him not at all  through that vast space.    And my heart was very full; yet my soul but the stronger for it. And  then, behold, I was aware of a murmur in the night, coming to me, dim  and from afar off; and I saw the little shapes of the Peoples in the  lower embrasures, in constant movement; and I knew upon the instant that  the Multitudes did take that salute unto themselves, and cried out and  waved to me their farewells, or to come back--as may be.    And, indeed, I was but a lonesome person looking up at that great  mountain of metal and Life. And I knew that I had danger to realise my  plight; and I stayed no more; but did raise the Diskos, reversed, as was  but meet from one young man unto all the Millions.    And I looked swiftly upward through those eight great miles of night,  unto that Final Light which did shine in the black heavens; so that my  friend should know that I thought of him that was beyond my sight, in  that last moment. And it may be that the invisible millions that were  far up in the night, in the Upper Cities, did take that also to be a  meaning of farewell to themselves; for there came down out of the  monstrous height, a far, faint murmur of sound, as of a vague wind up in  the night.    Then did I lower the Diskos, and turn me about. And I breasted strangely  against the Air Clog, and stept forward across the Circle, into the  lonesomeness of the Night Land. And I looked no more behind; for that  which was my Home did weaken my heart somewhat, to behold; so that I  made determination that I look not again to my back, for a great while.    Yet, about me as I went, there was constant surging in the aether of the  world; and it did tell unto me how that those, my people and kin, had  continual mind of me, both in prayer and wishings, and in a perpetual  watching. And the same gave to me a feeling as of being something  companied; yet, in a time, it came to me that this disturbance of the  aether should tell to some Evil Force how that I was there abroad in the  Land. But how to stop this thing, who should have power? For, of truth,  had I been among them to make a full explaining of the danger, they had  been yet powerless to cease; for but to have such great multitudes  a-think upon one matter, was to set a disturbance about, as should be  most clear to all.    Now, at the beginning, I did walk outwards into the Night Land, somewhat  blindly, and without sure direction; being intent only to put a good  space to my back, that I might cure somewhat the ache which did weaken  my heart at the first.    But, in awhile, I ceased somewhat from my overswiftness, and did put  thought to my going. And I came quickly to reason that I should try"]]]
