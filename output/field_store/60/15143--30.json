He had already discovered the Ohio and Illinois rivers, and  in three expeditions, between 1680 and 1682, succeeded in working his  way right down to the mouth of the Mississippi, giving to the huge  tract of country which he had thus traversed the name of Louisiana,  after Louis XIV.    France thenceforth claimed the whole _hinterland_, as we should  now call it, of North America, the English being confined to the  comparatively narrow strip of country east of the Alleghanies. New  Orleans was founded at the mouth of the Mississippi in 1716, and  named after the Prince Regent; and French activity ranged between  Quebec and New Orleans, leaving many traces even to the present  day, in French names like Mobile, Detroit, and the like, through  the intervening country. The situation at the commencement of the  eighteenth century was remarkably similar to that of the Gold Coast  in Africa at the end of the nineteenth. The French persistently  attempted to encroach upon the English sphere of influence, and it  was in attempting to define the two spheres that George Washington  learned his first lesson in diplomacy and strategy. The French and  English American colonies were almost perpetually at war with one  another, the objective being the spot where Pittsburg now stands,  which was regarded as the gate of the west, overlooking as it did  the valley of the Ohio. Here Duquesne founded the fort named after  himself, and it was not till 1758 that this was finally wrested  from French hands; while, in the following year, Wolfe, by his  capture of Quebec, overthrew the whole French power in North America.  Throughout the long fight the English had been much assisted by  the guerilla warfare of the Iroquois against the French.    By the Treaty of Paris in 1763 the whole of French America was  ceded to England, which also obtained possession of Florida from  Spain, in exchange for the Philippines, captured during the war.  As a compensation all the country west of the Mississippi became  joined on to the Spanish possessions in Mexico. These of course  became, nominally French when Napoleon's brother Joseph was placed  on the Spanish throne, but Napoleon sold them to the United States  in 1803, so that no barrier existed to the westward spread of the  States. Long previously to this, a Chartered Company had been formed  in 1670, with Prince Rupert at its head, to trade with the Indians  for furs in Hudson's Bay, then and for some time afterwards called  Rupertsland. The Hudson Bay Company gradually extended its knowledge  of the northerly parts of America towards the Rocky Mountains,  but it was not till 1740 that Varenne de la Varanderye discovered  their extent. In 1769-71 a fur trader named Hearne traced the river  Coppermine to the sea, while it was not till 1793 that Mr. (after  Sir A.) Mackenzie discovered the river now named after him, and  crossed the continent of North America from Atlantic to Pacific.  One of the reasons for this late exploration of the north-west of  North America was a geographical myth started by a Spanish voyager  named Juan de Fuca as early as 1592. Coasting as far as Vancouver  Island, he entered the inlet to the south of it, and not being  able to see land to the north, brought back a report of a huge sea  spreading over all that part of the country, which most geographers  assumed to pass over into Hudson Bay or the neighbourhood. It was  this report as much as anything which encouraged hopes of finding  the north-west passage in a latitude low enough to be free from  ice.    As soon as the United States got possession of the land west of  the Mississippi they began to explore it, and between 1804 and  1807 Lewis and Clarke had explored the whole basin of the Missouri,  while Pike had investigated the country between the sources of the  Mississippi and the Red River. We have already seen that Behring  had carried over Russian investigation and dominion into Alaska,  and it was in order to avoid her encroachments down towards the  Californian coast that President Monroe put forth in 1823 the doctrine  that no further colonisation of the Americas would be permitted by  the United States. In this year Russia agreed to limit her claims  to the country north of 54.40 deg.. The States subsequently acquired  California and other adjoining states during their war with Mexico  in 1848, just before gold was discovered in the Sacramento valley.  The land between California and Alaska was held in joint possession  between Great Britain and the States, and was known as the Oregon  Territory. Lewis and Clarke had explored the Columbia River, while  Vancouver had much earlier examined the island which now bears his  name, so that both countries appear to have some rights of discovery  to the district. At one time the inhabitants of the States were  inclined to claim all the country as far as the Russian boundary  54.40 deg., and a war-cry arose \"54.40 deg. or fight;\" but in 1846 the  territory was divided by the 49th parallel, and at this date we may  say the partition of America was complete, and all that remained  to be known of it was the ice-bound northern coast, over which so  much heroic enterprise has been displayed.    The history of geographical discovery in America is thus in large  measure a history of conquest. Men got to know both coast-line and  interior while endeavouring either to trade or to settle where  nature was propitious, or the country afforded mineral or vegetable  wealth that could be easily transported. Of the coast early knowledge  was acquired for geography; but where the continent broadens out  either north or south, making the interior inaccessible for trade  purposes with the coasts, ignorance remained even down to the present  century. Even to the present day the country south of the valley  of the Amazon is perhaps as little known as any portion of the  earth's surface, while, as we have seen, it was not till the early  years of this century that any knowledge was acquired of the huge  tract of country between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains.  It was the natural expansion of the United States, rendered possible  by the cession of this tract to the States by Napoleon in 1803,  that brought it within the knowledge of all. That expansion was  chiefly due to the improved methods of communication which steam  has given to mankind only within this century. But for this the  region east of the Rocky Mountains would possibly be as little  known to Europeans, even at the present day, as the Soudan or  Somaliland. It is owing to this natural expansion of the States,  and in minor measure of Canada, that few great names of geographical  explorers are connected with our knowledge of the interior of North  America. Unknown settlers have been the pioneers of geography,  and not as elsewhere has the reverse been the case. In the two  other continents whose geographical history we have still to trace,  Australia and Africa, explorers have preceded settlers or conquerors,  and we can generally follow the course of geographical discovery  in their case without the necessity of discussing their political  history.    [_Authorities:_ Winsor, _From Cartier to Frontenac_; Gelcich, in  _Mittheilungen_ of Geographical Society of Vienna, 1892.]          CHAPTER X    AUSTRALIA AND THE SOUTH SEAS--TASMAN AND COOK    If one looks at the west coast of Australia one is struck by the  large number of Dutch names which are jotted down the coast. There  is Hoog Island, Diemen's Bay, Houtman's Abrolhos, De Wit land, and  the Archipelago of Nuyts, besides Dirk Hartog's Island and Cape  Leeuwin. To the extreme north we find the Gulf of Carpentaria,  and to the extreme south the island which used to be called Van  Diemen's Land. It is not altogether to be wondered at that almost  to the middle of this century the land we now call Australia was  tolerably well known as New Holland. If the Dutch had struck the  more fertile eastern shores of the Australian continent, it might  have been called with reason New Holland to the present day; but  there is scarcely any long coast-line of the world so inhospitable  and so little promising as that of Western Australia, and one can  easily understand how the Dutch, though they explored it, did not  care to take possession of it.    [Illustration: TERRES AUSTRALES. d'apres d'Anville. 1746.]    But though the Dutch were the first to explore any considerable  stretch of Australian coast, they were by no means the first to  sight it. As early as 1542 a Spanish expedition under Luis Lopez de  Villalobos, was despatched to follow up the discoveries of Magellan  in the Pacific Ocean within the Spanish sphere of influence. He  discovered several of the islands of Polynesia, and attempted to  seize the Philippines, but his fleet had to return to New Spain.  One of the ships coasted along an island to which was given the  name of New Guinea, and was thought to be part of the great unknown  southern land which Ptolemy had imagined to exist in the south  of the Indian Ocean, and to be connected in some way with Tierra  del Fuego. Curiosity was thus aroused, and in 1606 Pedro de Quiros  was despatched on a voyage to the South Seas with three ships.  He discovered the New Hebrides, and believed it formed part of  the southern continent, and he therefore named it Australia del  Espiritu Santo, and hastened home to obtain the viceroyalty of  this new possession. One of his ships got separated from him, and  the commander, Luys Vaz de Torres, sailed farther to the south-west,  and thereby learned that the New Australia was not a continent but  an island. He proceeded farther till he came to New Guinea, which  he coasted along the south coast, and seeing land to the south of  him, he thus passed through the straits since named"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#20)"],[1,"and butter. Bake 50 minutes in moderate oven.       Onion Soup au Gratin    4 or 5 onions, sliced  4 or 5 tablespoons butter  1 quart stock or canned consomme  1 quart bouillon made from dissolving 4 or 5 cubes  Rounds of toasted French bread  1-1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese         Saute onions in butter in a roomy saucepan until light golden,       and pour the stock over. When heated put in a larger casserole,       add the bouillon, season to taste and heat to boiling point. Let       simmer 15 minutes and serve in deep well-heated soup plates, the       bottoms covered with rounds of toasted French bread which have       been heaped with freshly grated Parmesan and browned under the       broiler. More cheese is served for guests to sprinkle on as       desired.    At gala parties, where wine flows, a couple of glasses of champagne  are often added to the bouillon.    In the famed onion soup _au gratin_ at Les Halles in Paris, grated  Gruyere is used in place of Parmesan. They are interchangeable in this  recipe.      AMERICAN CHEESE SOUPS         In this era of fine canned soups a quick cheese soup is made by       heating cream of tomato soup, ready made, and adding finely       grated Swiss or Parmesan to taste. French bread toasted and       topped with more cheese and broiled golden makes the best base to       pour this over, as is done with the French onion soup above.         The same cheese toasts are the basis of a simple milk-cheese       soup, with heated milk poured over and a seasoning of salt,       pepper, chopped chives, or a dash of nutmeg.       Chicken Cheese Soup         Heat together 1 cup milk, 1 cup water in which 2 chicken bouillon       cubes have been dissolved, and 1 can of condensed cream of       chicken soup. Stir in 1/4 cup grated American Cheddar cheese and       season with salt, pepper, and plenty of paprika until cheese       melts.         Other popular American recipes simply add grated cheese to lima       bean or split bean soup, peanut butter soup, or plain cheese soup       with rice.    Imported French _marmites_ are _de rigueur_ for a real onion soup _au  gratin_, and an imported Parmesan grinder might be used for freshly  ground cheese. In preparing, it is well to remember that they are  basically only melted cheese, melted from the top down.      CHEESE SALADS         When a Frenchman reaches the salad he is resting and in no hurry.       He eats the salad to prepare himself for the cheese.         Henri Charpentier, _Life & la Henri_,       Green Cheese Salad Julienne         Take endive, water cress and as many different kinds of crisp       lettuce as you can find and mix well with Provolone cheese cut in       thin julienne strips and marinated 3 to 4 hours in French       dressing. Crumble over the salad some Blue cheese and toss       everything thoroughly, with plenty of French dressing.       American Cheese Salad         Slice a sweet ripe pineapple thin and sprinkle with shredded       American Cheddar. Serve on lettuce dipped in French dressing.       Cheese and Nut Salad         Mix American Cheddar with an equal amount of nut meats and enough       mayonnaise to make a paste. Roll these in little balls and serve       with fruit salads, dusting lightly with finely grated Sapsago.       Brie or Camembert Salad         Fill ripe pear-or peach-halves with creamy imported Brie or       Camembert, sprinkle with honey, serve on lettuce drenched with       French dressing and scatter shredded almonds over. (Cream cheese       will do in a pinch. If the Camembert isn't creamy enough, mash it       with some sweet cream.)       Three-in-One Mold    3/4 cup cream cheese  1/2 cup grated American Cheddar cheese  1/2 cup Roquefort cheese, crumbled  2 tablespoons gelatin, dissolved and stirred into  1/2 cup boiling water  Juice of 1 lemon  Salt  Pepper  2 cups cream, beaten stiff  1/2 cup minced chives         Mash the cheeses together, season gelatin liquid with lemon, salt       and pepper and stir into cheese with the whipped cream. Add       chives last Put in ring mold or any mold you fancy, chill well       and slice at table to serve on lettuce with a little mayonnaise,       or plain.       Swiss Cheese Salad         Dice 1/2 pound of cheese into 1/2-inch cubes. Slice one onion       very thin. Mix well in a soup plate. Dash with German mustard,       olive oil, wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce. Salt lightly and       grind in plenty of black pepper. Then stir, preferably with a       wooden spoon so you won't mash the cheese, until every hole is       drenched with the dressing.       Rosie's Swiss Breakfast Cheese Salad    Often Emmentaler is cubed in a salad for breakfast, relished specially  by males on the morning after. We quote the original recipe brought  over by Rosie from the Swiss Tyrol to thrill the writers' and artists'  colony of Ridgefield, New Jersey, in her brother Emil's White House  Inn:         First Rosie cut a thick slice of prime imported Emmentaler into       half-inch cubes. Then she mixed imported French olive oil, German       mustard and Swiss white wine vinegar with salt and freshly ground       pepper in a deep soup plate, sprinkled on a few drops of pepper       sauce scattered in the chunks of Schweizer and stirred the cubes       with a light hand, using a wooden fork and spoon to prevent       bruising.         The salad was ready to eat only when each and every tiny, shiny       cell of the Swiss from the homeland had been washed, oiled and       polished with the soothing mixture.         \"Drink down the juice, too, when you have finished mine Breakfast       Cheese Salad,\" Rosie advised the customers. \"It is the best cure       in the world for the worst hangover.\"       Gorgonzola and Banana Salad         Slice bananas lengthwise, as for a banana split. Sprinkle with       lemon juice and spread with creamy Gorgonzola. Sluice with French       dressing made with lemon juice in place of vinegar, to help bring       out the natural banana flavor of ripe Gorgonzola.       Cheese and Pea Salad         Cube 1/2 pound of American Cheddar and mix with a can of peas, 1       cup of diced celery, 1 cup of mayonnaise, 1/2 cup of sour cream,       and 2 tablespoons each of minced pimientos and sweet pickles.       Serve in lettuce cups with a sprinkling of parsley and chopped       radishes.       Apple and Cheese Salad    1/2 cup cream cheese  1 cup chopped pecans  Salt and pepper  Apples, sliced 1/2-inch thick  Lettuce leaves  Creamy salad dressing         Make tiny seasoned cheese balls, center on the apple slices       standing on lettuce leaves, and sluice with creamy salad       dressing.       Roquefort Cheese Salad Dressing         No cheese sauce is easier to make than the American favorite of       Roquefort cheese mashed with a fork and mixed with French       dressing. It is often made in a pint Mason jar and kept in the       refrigerator to shake up on occasion and toss over lettuce or       other salads.    Unfortunately, even when the Roquefort is the French import, complete  with the picture of the sheep in red, and _garanti veritable_, the  dressing is often ruined by bad vinegar and cottonseed oil (of all  things). When bottled to sell in stores, all sorts of extraneous  spice, oils and mustard flour are used where nothing more is necessary  than the manipulation of a fork, fine olive oil and good  vinegar--white wine, tarragon or malt. Some ardent amateurs must have  their splash of Worcestershire sauce or lemon juice with salt and  pepper. This Roquefort dressing is good on all green salads, but on  endive it's something special.       SAUCE MORNAY    Sauce Mornay has been hailed internationally as \"the greatest culinary  achievement in cheese.\"         Nothing is simpler to make. All you do is prepare a white sauce       (the French Sauce Bechamel) and add grated Parmesan to your       liking, stirring it in until melted and the sauce is creamy. This       can be snapped up with cayenne or minced parsley, and when used       with fish a little of the cooking broth is added.       PLAIN CHEESE SAUCE    1 part of any grated cheese to 4 parts of white sauce         This is a mild sauce that is nice with creamed or hard-cooked       eggs. When the cheese content is doubled, 2 parts of cheese to 4       of white sauce, it is delicious on boiled cauliflower, baked       potatoes, macaroni and crackers soaked in milk.         The sauce may be made richer by mixing melted butter with the       flour in making the white sauce, or by beating egg yolk in with       the cheese.    From thin to medium to thick it serves divers purposes:    _Thin_: it may be used instead of milk to make a tasty milk toast,  sometimes spiced with curry.    _Medium_: for baking by pouring over crackers soaked in milk.    _Thick_: serves as a sort of Welsh Rabbit when poured generously over  bread toasted on one side only, with the untoasted side up, to let the  sauce sink in.       PARSLEYED CHEESE SAUCE         This makes a mild, pleasantly pungent sauce, to enliven the       cabbage family--hot cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage and Brussels       sprouts. Croutons help when sprinkled over.      CORNUCOPIA OF CHEESE RECIPES      Since this is the Complete Book of Cheese we will fill a bounteous  cornucopia here with more or less essential, if not indispensable,  recipes and dishes not so easy to classify, or overlooked or crowded  out of the main sections devoted to the classic Fondues, Rabbits,  Souffles, etc.      _Stuffed Celery, Endive, Anise and Other Suitable Stalks_    Use any soft cheese you like, or firm cheese softened by pressing  through a sieve; at room temperature, of course, with any seasoning or  relish.         SUGGESTIONS:         Cream cheese and chopped chives, pimientos, olives, or all three,       with or without a touch of Worcestershire.         Cottage cheese and piccalilli or chili sauce.
