L'ENSEIGNE DU CHAPELIER    Un de mes amis, voulant s'etablir chapelier, consulta plusieurs  de ses connaissances sur l'important chapitre de l'enseigne.  Celle qu'il se proposait d'adopter etait ainsi concue: \"John  Thompson, chapelier, fait et vend des chapeaux au comptant\";  suivait le chapeau, signe auquel on reconnait tous ceux de sa  profession. Le premier ami dont il reclama les conseils lui fit  observer que le mot chapelier etait tout a fait superflu, et  qu'il vaudrait mieux le supprimer; il en convint sur-le-champ  et le mot fut raye. Le second remarqua qu'il etait a peu pres  inutile de mentionner que John vendait au comptant. \"Peu de gens,  dit-il, achetent a credit un article d'aussi peu d'importance  qu'un chapeau; et, au cas ou l'on demanderait credit, il peut  arriver que le marchand lui-meme trouve[1] a propos de l'accorder.\"  Les mots furent en consequence effaces, et l'enseigne se borna a  cette courte phrase: \"John Thompson fait et vend des chapeaux.\"  Un troisieme ami l'abregea encore en affirmant que ceux qui avaient  besoin de se pourvoir d'un chapeau s'inquietaient peu de savoir  par qui il etait fait. Mais quand un quatrieme conseiller lut  les mots restants: \"John Thompson vend des chapeaux,\" il s'ecria:  \"Eh! mon Dieu! croyez-vous qu'on s'imaginera que vous voulez les  donner?\" En consequence, deux mots de plus ayant ete supprimes,  il ne resta que le nom du marchand et l'effigie du chapeau.

Un  conteur de profession, auquel on reprochait ce defaut, repondit  assez naivement: \"Il faut bien que vous me permettiez[1] de vous  redire de temps en temps mes petits contes; sans cela je les  oublierais.\"    [Footnote 1: Why subjunctive?]      Quel est le faible des conteurs?--Avec qui parlait-on de cet  inconvenient?--Comment s'est-il justifie?      144. _L'ASTROLOGUE SAUVE_ PAR SA _PRESENCE_ D'ESPRIT    Un astrologue, sous le regne de Louis XI, ayant _predit_ quelque  chose de desagreable a ce roi, sa _majeste_, pour se venger,  _resolut_ de le faire _mourir_. Il envoie le jour suivant chercher  l'astrologue, et ordonne a ses gens, a un signal donne, de le  jeter par la fenetre. Aussitot que le _roi_ le voit: \"Vous qui  pretendez, dit-il, etre si _sage_, et savoir si parfaitement la  _destinee_ des autres, dites-moi un peu quelle est la votre,  et combien de temps vous avez encore a vivre.\" L'astrologue,  qui savait qu'il y allait de sa vie, repondit avec une grande  presence d'esprit: \"Je sais ma destinee, et je suis certain de  mourir trois jours avant votre majeste.\" Le roi, la-dessus, loin  de le faire jeter par la fenetre, fit prendre, au contraire, le  plus grand _soin_ de lui, et fit tout ce qui etait en son pouvoir  pour retarder la mort de celui qu'il _devait_ sitot suivre.

UN MOT DE TRIBOULET    L'usage des bouffons fut legue par l'antiquite au moyen age.  Il se perpetua sous les rois de France, et l'emploi d'amuseur  officiel devint une veritable charge a la cour des Valois. Les  bouffons etaient, en general, des nains contrefaits que l'on  affublait d'une livree bizarre et que les rois ou les princes  entretenaient aupres d'eux pour s'amuser de leurs faceties.    Triboulet, qui vecut sous Louis XII et Francois, I, est un de  nos bouffons les plus celebres. Son esprit, fertile en saillies,  ne menageait personne; mais ses bons mots etaient si plaisants  que, d'ordinaire, le rire qu'ils provoquaient disposait a  l'indulgence. Cependant il rencontra parfois sur son chemin des  gens qui accueillirent mal ses plaisanteries. Un jour meme, certain  seigneur se facha si fort contre Triboulet qu'il le menaca de  lui passer son epee a travers le corps. Le pauvre bouffon, tout  effraye, vint se plaindre au roi du mauvais traitement dont on le  menacait. \"Que ton ennemi, s'ecria Francois I, ne s'avise[1] pas  de commettre une si sotte action, car je le fais pendre un quart  d'heure apres.--Merci, prince, repondit le bouffon; je n'attendais  pas moins de votre generosite. Mais voulez-vous mettre le comble  a votre bonte?--Que dois-je donc t'accorder encore?--Faites-le  pendre un quart d'heure avant.\"--CLAUDE AUGE.

LE PAYSAN ET LE PRINCE    Il etait une fois un prince puissant et opulent qui pour agrandir  le parc de son chateau, depouilla un pauvre paysan du seul morceau  de terre qu'il possedait. Un jour, comme il se promenait, triste  et preoccupe, dans le champ qu'il avait vole, il vit le paysan  qui s'approchait de lui, tenant a la main un sac vide. \"Je viens  vous parler, prince, dit-il, les larmes aux yeux, de vouloir  bien accorder une grace a celui que vous avez vole; souffrez  qu'il emporte[1] de son patrimoine seulement autant de terre  que se sac peut contenir.--Je ne puis vous refuser l'objet de  cette sotte demande,\" repondit l'usurpateur.    Le paysan remplit alors de terre son sac: \"J'ai encore une grace  a vous demander, dit-il ensuite a son fief interlocuteur, c'est de  m'aider a charger ce sac sur mon epaule.\" Le prince y consentit,  bien qu'impatiente et pret a entrer en colere; mais lorsqu'il  voulut soulever le sac plein, il s'ecria: \"Je suis fou de vouloir  soulever ce sac, il est trop lourd; homme singulier, emportez-le  comme vous pourrez.\" Alors le paysan, se redressant devant le  prince, lui dit: \"Un seul sac de cette terre est deja trop lourd  pour vous, et vous ne craignez pas de charger votre conscience  de tout le poids de ce champ!\"    Frappe de ces paroles, le prince comprit l'injustice de l'action  qu'il avait commise et il restitua aussitot au paysan le champ  qu'il lui avait pris.

And the whole North  knows that our rangy half-breeds are at their best when there are  storms, and the route is rough and broken. The luck of the trail,\"  sighing, \"but at that, they were marvels.\"    Without cavil, and with due praise from friend and antagonist alike, the  success of the Siberians that year had been phenomenal and well  deserved. And so, when the \"Iron Man\" John Johnson, driving a team  entered by Colonel Charles Ramsay of London, and Fox Ramsay driving his  own team of the same type, were first and second, the Ramsay Tartan  fluttered beside the flag of Finland in triumph. It made no difference  that one driver was the son of a Scotch Earl and one of a Scandinavian  Peasant--they were both men in the eyes of all Alaska; and they were  both, with their sturdy dogs, saluted as victors in this classic of the  snows. And John Johnson's record of four hundred and eight miles in  seventy-four hours, fourteen minutes, and twenty-two seconds had made  history in the North.    [Illustration: The Ramsay Siberians]    \"I did not feel half so bad, did you, 'Scotty,' when Fay Dalzene beat us  with that great team of his and Russ Bowen's? For after all they were  our type of dog, and justified our faith in the Alaskans.\"      But no one year's result, nor the accumulated result of several years,  could settle the question of supremacy between the two breeds; and so  the smouldering rivalry continued and was fanned into a hot flame each  season just before the Solomon Derby.    \"You'll have a lot of able rivals, if the immense number of speedy teams  I see in the streets means anything,\" was the Big Man's comment one  evening when the Woman, after a fast drive, was boasting of the marked  improvement in the team work of their entry.    \"'Scotty' says he's glad of it; the more teams that go into racing the  higher the standard in Nome. There has never been a time since the camp  started when there have been so many efficient dogs as now; and it's  just because the people are learning that the only way you can have good  dogs is to give them good care. When an Eskimo gets together a racing  team, and an excellent one at that, it begins to look like a general  reform. Don't you remember when practically all of the natives used to  force puppies, who were far too young to be driven at all, to draw the  entire family in a sled that was already overflowing with household  goods?\"    \"Yes, at one time you could certainly tell an Eskimo team as far as you  could see it by the gait of the wretched, mangy beasts, that always  appeared to be in the last stages of exhaustion.\"    \"And there's really a vast improvement in the freighting teams as well;  for so many dogs that do not quite make the racing teams become  freighters and show the results of their breeding and training there. In  fact,\" enthusiastically, \"I am sure that dog racing has been an enormous  benefit to Nome in every way. Stefansson told me himself that never in  his experience, and it has been wide, had he found such dogs as those  'Scotty' bought for their Canadian Arctic Expedition. And I believe,\"  with conviction, \"it is because Nome dogs, through the races, are  acknowledged to be the best in all the North--for both sport and work.\"    The Big Man smiled, and suggested, banteringly, that she embody those  views into form for the benefit of Congress.    The Woman looked rather puzzled. \"Congress?\" she demanded; \"and why  Congress?\"    \"Because,\" he continued with some amusement, \"there are people who  venture to differ with you materially in your view-point. I understand  that very recently the Kennel Club has received communications from  various high officials of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to  Animals, threatening to place the matter of dog racing in Nome before  Congress, with the hope of having these cruel racing contests stopped.    \"That is, of course, if those concerned cannot be made to see the error  of their ways by some less drastic method.\"    For a moment the Woman was quite speechless with surprise and dismay.    \"Well,\" she finally exclaimed, \"if that isn't human nature for  you--beams and motes and all that sort of thing.    \"Good people with the very best intentions in the world, trying to  interfere in affairs about which they know nothing, thousands of miles  away; when probably around the very next corner are things about which  they should know everything, needing their attention constantly.\"    \"They say, in one letter, that there are many Alaskans, as well as  Outsiders, who have made these complaints.\"    \"Oh, I dare say,\" scornfully, \"even in Alaska there are persons whose  only idea of a dog is that of a fat, wheezy house-dog who crunches bones  under the dining table, and sleeps on a crocheted shawl in a Morris  chair. But _real_ Alaskans know that pity for the dogs of the North  should be felt, not for the Racers, but for the poor work dogs who haul  their burdens of lumber and machinery and all kinds of supplies out to  the distant mines.    \"And that, too, over rough and splintered ties in the glare of the  fierce summer sun that shines for nearly twenty-four hours at a stretch.  I'll wager,\" defiantly, \"that if Alaska dogs have one supreme ambition,  like that of every loyal small American boy to become President of the  United States, it is to become a member of a racing team.\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" agreed the Big Man soothingly. \"But Congress, I believe,  is ignorant of such ambitions as yet.\"    \"Congress is ignorant of a good many things concerning Alaska and the  Alaskans,\" contemptuously.    \"It was because for years Congress imposed a prohibitive tax on  railways through this wilderness, a tax only just now removed, that  innumerable freighters, day after day, have crawled into town unnoticed,  with feet cut and bruised and bleeding, and with no one to herald their  suffering to a sympathetic world. It's because their labors were not  spectacular, and the dogs were too obscure to attract more than a  passing pity--never national interest, or interference.\"    \"But they assert, if I may go on,\" ventured the Big Man with an  assumption of fear, \"that the condition of the dogs, at the finish of  these four hundred and eight mile races, is deplorable.\"    \"They're tired; naturally very tired; though the necessity of fairly  forcing their steps through the crushing, cheering, frantic mob often  gives them an effect of utter exhaustion that belies their actual  condition.    \"You know how often we have gone down to the Kennel within an hour or so  after their arrival, and have found them comfortably resting and showing  little, if any, signs of the ordeal. Many and many a prospector's team  is in far worse condition after a severe winter's trip, made just for  ordinary business purposes, while all of the Kennel Club's rules for  racing are aimed against cruelty.    \"Why, you know that the very first one says you must bring back every  dog with which you started, dead or alive, and--\"    The Big Man laughed heartily. \"Dare I mention that the 'Dead or Alive'  rule is the one that seems to have caused the most unfavorable comment  Outside.    \"They seem to think it has rather a desperate 'win at any hazard' sound  that needs toning down a bit.\"    \"It means,\" remarked the Woman severely, \"that even if a dog becomes  lame or useless, and a detriment to the rest, he must not be abandoned,  but brought back just the same. And as a team is only as strong as its  weakest member, surely they can realize that it is a matter of policy,  even if not prompted by his love for them, for every driver to keep his  dogs in the best possible condition--that he may not be forced to carry  one that is disabled upon his sled. That would seriously handicap any  team.\"    \"Of course, my dear, all will admit, even Congress, that this is no  country for weaklings--men or dogs--and that is no contest for those who  cannot brave the elements and survive the dangers of a desperately hard  trail.    \"And I will maintain, freely, that no athletes in the Olympic Games of  Greece, nor college men in training for the field, are more carefully  and considerately treated than are the dogs in the All Alaska  Sweepstakes. But, you see, these Outsiders don't know that.\"    \"I only wish,\" said the Woman earnestly, \"that the Officers of the  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and Congress, and  everybody, might hear the way Dalzene, Holmsen, Hegness, Fred Ayers, and  the Johnsons speak of their dogs, just as one speaks of cherished  friends, not dumb brutes. If they had seen the 'Iron Man' with the tears  rolling down his furrowed cheeks as he tenderly caressed the dead body  of one of his little Siberians; or had watched 'Scotty' Allan breast the  icy waters of a surging flood the night of the great storm, to save an  injured dog not even his own, I am sure there would be no further talk  of cruelty amongst dog racers. And to think,\" she concluded  indignantly, \"that these protests come from congested centers in  civilized communities, where pampered poodles die from lack of exercise  and over-feeding, and little children from overwork and starvation!\"    \"There is no occasion for immediate worry,\" was the Big Man's  consolation. \"I rather think Congress has troubles enough of its own  just at present, without mixing up in dog racing in Nome. There won't be  much excitement about it in Washington this session.\"    Early in the day before the coming event, the Woman sauntered down  toward the Kennel slowly, her mind filled with agreeable memories and  happy anticipations.    At this last try-out the team had shown more speed than ever, and a  certain delight in their work that spoke well for the final selection  that had been made; while Kid, as a leader, had "]]]
