I  always thought lard was made from milk and butter was made from  cream.\"    The Professor's wife possessed, besides a liking for pies, the  German's fondness for anything pertaining to fritters. She used a set  of \"wafer and cup irons\" for making \"Rosen Kuchen,\" as she called the  flat, saucer-like wafer; and the cup used for serving creamed  vegetables, salads, etc., was similar to pattie cases.    \"The 'Wafer and Cup Irons,'\" said Frau Schmidt, \"were invented by a  friend of mine, also a teacher and an excellent cook, besides; she  gave me several of her original recipes, all to be served on wafers or  in patties. You shall have a set of the irons when you start  housekeeping. Mary. You will be surprised at the many uses you will  find for them. They are somewhat similar to Rosette Irons, but I think  them an improvement. They are pieces of fluted steel fastened to a  long handle and one is cup-shaped. This latter is particularly fine  for making patties. Then the cup may be filled and served on  saucer-like wafers, which I call 'Rosen Kuchen,' or the 'Rosen Kuchen'  may be simply dusted with a mixture consisting of one cup of sugar,  one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoonful of powdered  cardamon seed, and served on a plate, as dainty cakes or wafers.\"    Aunt Sarah, when cooking fritters, always used two-thirds lard and  one-third suet for deep frying, but \"Frau Schmidt\" taught Mary to use  a good brand of oil for this purpose, as she thought food fried in oil  more digestible and wholesome than when fried in lard. The patties or  wafers were easily made. \"Frau Schmidt\" placed the long-handled iron  in hot fat, the right temperature for frying fritters. When the iron  was heated she quickly and carefully wiped off any surplus fat, then  at once dipped the hot wafer iron into a bowl containing the batter  she had prepared (the recipe for which she gave Mary), then dipped the  iron into the hot fat; when the batter had lightly browned she gently  dropped it from the iron onto brown paper, to absorb any fat which  might remain. These are quickly and easily prepared and, after a few  trials, one acquires proficiency. Pattie cases or cup-shapes are made  in a similar manner. They are not expensive and may be kept several  weeks in a cool, dry place. When wanted for table use, place in a hot  oven a few minutes to reheat. They make a dainty addition to a  luncheon by simply dusting the \"Rosen Kuchen\" with pulverised sugar.  Creamed vegetables of any variety may be served on them by placing a  spoon of cream dressing on top of each, over which grate yolk of hard  boiled egg; or use as a foundation on which to serve salads; or serve  fruit on them with whipped cream. The patties or cups may be used to  serve creamed chicken, oysters, or sweetbreads if no sugar be used in  the batter. These pattie cases are exactly like those sold at  delicatessen counters, in city stores, and are considered quite an  addition to a dainty luncheon. They are rather expensive to buy, and  we country housewives cannot always procure them when wanted, and they  may be made at home with a small amount of labor and less expense.    \"The Germans make fritters of almost everything imaginable,\" continued  the Professor's wife. \"One day in early Spring I saw a German neighbor  gathering elderberry blossoms, of which she said she intended making  fritters. I asked her how they were made, being curious, I will  confess. She sent me a plate of the fritters and they were delicious.  I will give you her recipe should you care for it. Mary, have you ever  eaten a small, sweet wafer called 'Zimmet Waffle?' My mother made them  at Christmas time, in Germany. Should I be able to procure a small  'waffle,' or I should call it wafer, iron, in the city, I will teach  you how they are made. I think them excellent. My mother made a cake  dough similar to that of pound cake. To one portion she added  cinnamon, to the other chocolate, and the last portion was flavored  with vanilla. A piece of dough the size of a small marble was placed  in the wafer iron, which was then pressed together and held over the  fire in the range, by a long handle, until the wafer was crisp and  brown. They are delicious and will keep indefinitely.\"    The Professor's wife finished speaking to Mary, and turned to her  daughter Elizabeth, saying, \"It is time I mix the dough if we are to  have 'Boova Shenkel' for dinner today. I see the potatoes have steamed  tender.\"    \"Oh, goody!\" said Pauline, \"I just love 'Boova Shenkel!'\"    \"Then,\" said her Mother, \"run down into the cellar and get me three  eggs for them, and Mary, I'll write off the recipe for you, if you  wish it, as I feel sure you'll like them as well as Pauline. And  Elizabeth, dust powdered sugar over this plate of 'Rosen Kuchen,' and  you, Mary and Pauline, leave this hot kitchen and have lunch out in  the 'Espalier,' as your Father calls it.\"    \"I think,\" said Mary to Elizabeth, after they were seated in the  shade, prepared to enjoy the \"Rosen Kuchen,\" \"this little, natural,  home-grown summer-house is the oddest and prettiest little place I've  ever seen.\"    \"Yes,\" assented Elizabeth, \"Father said he made it as nearly like as  possible to a large one at Weisbaden, no great distance from his old  home in Germany. He says the 'Frauer Esche,' meaning Weeping Ash, at  Weisbaden, had tables and benches placed beneath spreading branches of  the tree, and picnics were frequently held there. This one was made by  the larger branches of the Weeping Ash, turning downward, fastened by  pieces of leather to a framework nailed to the top of posts in the  ground, about two yards apart, surrounding the tree. The posts, you  notice, are just a little higher than an ordinary man, and when the  leaves thickly cover the tops and sides, protecting one from the  sun's rays, it is an ideal Summer-house. We frequently sit here  evenings and afternoons; Mother brings her sewing and Pauline her doll  family, which, you know, is quite numerous.\"    \"I never saw a Summer-house at all like it,\" said Mary.    The Professor's wife not only taught Mary the making of superior  pastry and the cooking of German dishes, but what was of still greater  importance, taught her the value of different foods; that cereals of  every description, flour and potatoes, are starchy foods; that cream,  butter, oil, etc., are fat foods; that all fruits and vegetables  contain mineral matter; and that lean meat, eggs, beans, peas and milk  are muscle-forming foods. These are things every young housekeeper  should have a knowledge of to be able to plan nourishing, wholesome,  well-balanced meals for her family. And not to serve at one time a  dish of rice, cheese and macaroni, baked beans and potatoes. Serve  instead with one of these dishes fruit, a vegetable or salad. She  said, \"beans have a large percentage of nutriment and should be more  commonly used.\" She also said graham and corn bread are much more  nutritious than bread made from fine white flour, which lacks the  nutritious elements. Indian corn is said to contain the largest amount  of fat of any cereal. It is one of our most important cereal foods and  should be more commonly used by housewives; especially should it be  used by working men whose occupation requires a great amount of  physical exercise. Particularly in cold weather should it be  frequently served, being both cheap and wholesome.    The Professor's wife laughingly remarked to Mary, \"When I fry fritters  or 'Fast Nacht' cakes, Fritz and Pauline usually assist such a large  number of them in disappearing before I have finished baking, I am  reminded of 'Doughnutting Time,' by J.W. Foley. Have you never read  the poem? I sometimes feel that it must have been written by me.\"      [A]\"DOUGHNUTTING TIME.\"        Wunst w'en our girl wuz makin' pies an' doughnuts--'ist a Lot--      We stood around with great, big eyes, 'cuz we boys like 'em hot;      And w'en she dropped 'em in the lard, they sizzled 'ist like fun,      And w'en she takes 'em out, it's hard to keep from takin' one.        And 'en she says: \"You boys'll get all spattered up with grease.\"      And by-um-by she says she'll let us have 'ist one apiece;      So I took one for me, and one for little James McBride,      The widow's only orfunt son, 'ats waitin' there outside.        An' Henry, he took one 'ist for himself an' Nellie Flynn,      'At's waitin' at the kitchen door and dassent to come in,      Becuz her Mother told her not; and Johnny, he took two,      'Cus Amey Brennan likes 'em hot, 'ist like we chinnern do.        'En Henry happened 'ist to think he didn't get a one      For little Ebenezer Brink, the carpet beater's son,      Who never gets 'em home, becuz he says, he ain't quite sure,      But thinks perhaps the reason wuz, his folkeses are too poor.        An 'en I give my own away to little Willie Biggs      'At fell down his stairs one day, an' give him crooked legs,      'Cuz Willie always seems to know w'en our girl's goin' to bake.      He wouldn't ast for none. Oh, no! But, my! he's fond of cake.        So I went back an' 'en I got another one for me,      Right out the kittle smokin' hot, an' brown as it could be;      An' John he got one, too, becuz he give his own to Clare,      An' w'en our girl she looked, there wuz 'ist two small doughnuts      there.        My! she wuz angry w'en she looked an' saw 'ist them two there,      An' says she knew 'at she had cooked a crock full an' to spare;      She says it's awful 'scouragin' to bake and fret an' fuss,      An' w'en she thinks she's got 'em in the crock, they're all in us.

Dutton, by permission of the author,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#20)"],[1,"the  chinks of the logs was one night frozen to stone. Just as the work was  about half completed, the frost suddenly setting in, put a stop to our  proceeding for some time, as the frozen plaster yielded neither to fire  nor to hot water, the latter freezing before it had any effect on the  mass, and rather making bad worse. Then the workman that was hewing the  inside walls to make them smooth, wounded himself with the broad axe,  and was unable to resume his work for some time.    I state these things merely to show the difficulties that attend us in  the fulfilment of our plans, and this accounts in a great measure for  the humble dwellings that settlers of the most respectable description  are obliged to content themselves with at first coming to this country,  --not, you may be assured, from inclination, but necessity: I could give  you such narratives of this kind as would astonish you. After all, it  serves to make us more satisfied than we should be on casting our eyes  around to see few better off than we are, and many not half so  comfortable, yet of equal, and, in some instances, superior pretensions  as to station and fortune.    Every man in this country is his own glazier; this you will laugh at:  but if he does not wish to see and feel the discomfort of broken panes,  he must learn to put them in his windows with his own hands. Workmen are  not easily to be had in the backwoods when you want them, and it would  be preposterous to hire a man at high wages to make two days' journey to  and from the nearest town to mend your windows. Boxes of glass of  several different sizes are to be bought at a very cheap rate in the  stores. My husband amused himself by glazing the windows of the house  preparatory to their being fixed in.    To understand the use of carpenter's tools, I assure you, is no  despicable or useless kind of knowledge here. I would strongly recommend  all young men coming to Canada to acquire a little acquaintance with  this valuable art, as they will often be put to great inconvenience for  the want of it.    I was once much amused with hearing the remarks made by a very fine  lady, the reluctant sharer of her husband's emigration, on seeing the  son of a naval officer of some rank in the service busily employed in  making an axe-handle out of a piece of rock-elm.    \"I wonder that you allow George to degrade himself so,\" she said,  addressing his father.    The captain looked up with surprise. \"Degrade himself! In what manner,  madam? My boy neither swears, drinks whiskey, steals, nor tells lies.\"    \"But you allow him to perform tasks of the most menial kind. What is he  now better than a hedge carpenter; and I suppose you allow him to chop,  too?\"    \"Most assuredly I do. That pile of logs in the cart there was all cut by  him after he had left study yesterday,\" was the reply,    \"I would see my boys dead before they should use an axe like common  labourers.\"    \"Idleness is the root of all evil,\" said the captain. \"How much worse  might my son be employed if he were running wild about streets with bad  companions.\"    \"You will allow this is not a country for gentlemen or ladies to live  in,\" said the lady.    \"It is the country for gentlemen that will not work and cannot live  without, to starve in,\" replied the captain bluntly; \"and for that  reason I make my boys early accustom themselves to be usefully and  actively employed.\"    \"My boys shall never work like common mechanics,\" said the lady,  indignantly.    \"Then, madam, they will be good for nothing as settlers; and it is a  pity you dragged them across the Atlantic.\"    \"We were forced to come. We could not live as we had been used to do at  home, or I never would have come to this horrid country.\"    \"Having come hither you would be wise to conform to circumstances.  Canada is not the place for idle folks to retrench a lost fortune in. In  some parts of the country you will find most articles of provision as  dear as in London, clothing much dearer, and not so good, and a bad  market to choose in.\"    \"I should like to know, then, who Canada is good for?\" said she,  angrily.    \"It is a good country for the honest, industrious artisan. It is a fine  country for the poor labourer, who, after a few years of hard toil, can  sit down in his own log-house, and look abroad on his own land, and see  his children well settled in life as independent freeholders. It is a  grand country for the rich speculator, who can afford to lay out a large  sum in purchasing land in eligible situations; for if he have any  judgment, he will make a hundred per cent as interest for his money  after waiting a few years. But it is a hard country for the poor  gentleman, whose habits have rendered him unfit for manual labour. He  brings with him a mind unfitted to his situation; and even if necessity  compels him to exertion, his labour is of little value. He has a hard  struggle to live. The certain expenses of wages and living are great,  and he is obliged to endure many privations if he would keep within  compass, and be free of debt. If he have a large family, and brings them  up wisely, so as to adapt themselves early to a settler's life, why he  does well for them, and soon feels the benefit on his own land; but if  he is idle himself, his wife extravagant and discontented, and the  children taught to despise labour, why, madam, they will soon be brought  down to ruin. In short, the country is a good country for those to whom  it is adapted; but if people will not conform to the doctrine of  necessity and expediency, they have no business in it. It is plain  Canada is not adapted to every class of people.\"    \"It was never adapted for me or my family,\" said the lady, disdainfully.    \"Very true,\" was the laconic reply; and so ended the dialogue.    But while I have been recounting these remarks, I have wandered far from  my original subject, and left my poor log-house quite in an unfinished  state. At last I was told it was in a habitable condition, and I was  soon engaged in all the bustle and fatigue attendant on removing our  household goods. We received all the assistance we required from ------,  who is ever ready and willing to help us. He laughed, and called it a  \"_moving_ bee;\" I said it was a \"fixing bee;\" and my husband said it was  a \"settling bee;\" I know we were unsettled enough till it was over. What  a din of desolation is a small house, or any house under such  circumstances. The idea of chaos must have been taken from a removal or  a setting to rights, for I suppose the ancients had their _flitting_, as  the Scotch call it, as well as the moderns.    Various were the valuable articles of crockery-ware that perished in  their short but rough journey through the woods. Peace to their manes. I  had a good helper in my Irish maid, who soon roused up famous fires, and  set the house in order.    We have now got quite comfortably settled, and I shall give you a  description of our little dwelling. What is finished is only a part of  the original plan; the rest must be added next spring, or fall, as  circumstances may suit.    A nice small sitting-room with a store closet, a kitchen, pantry, and  bed-chamber form the ground floor; there is a good upper floor that will  make three sleeping rooms.    \"What a nut-shell!\" I think I hear you exclaim. So it is at present; but  we purpose adding a handsome frame front as soon as we can get boards  from the mill, which will give us another parlour, long hall, and good  spare bed-room. The windows and glass door of our present sitting-room  command pleasant lake-views to the west and south. When the house is  completed, we shall have a verandah in front; and at the south side,  which forms an agreeable addition in the summer, being used as a sort of  outer room, in which we can dine, and have the advantage of cool air,  protected from the glare of the sunbeams. The Canadians call these  verandahs \"stoups.\" Few houses, either log or frame, are without them.  The pillars look extremely pretty, wreathed with the luxuriant hop-vine,  mixed with the scarlet creeper and \"morning glory,\" the American name  for the most splendid of major convolvuluses. These stoups are really a  considerable ornament, as they conceal in a great measure the rough  logs, and break the barn-like form of the building.    Our parlour is warmed by a handsome Franklin stove with brass gallery,  and fender. Our furniture consists of a brass-railed sofa, which serves  upon occasion for a bed, Canadian painted chairs, a stained pine table,  green and white curtains, and a handsome Indian mat that covers the  floor. One side of the room is filled up with our books. Some large maps  and a few good prints nearly conceal the rough walls, and form the  decoration of our little dwelling. Our bed-chamber is furnished with  equal simplicity. We do not, however, lack comfort in our humble home;  and though it is not exactly such as we could wish, it is as good as,  under existing circumstances, we could have.    I am anxiously looking forward to the spring, that I may get a garden  laid out in front of the house; as I mean to cultivate some of the  native fruits and flowers, which, I am sure, will improve greatly by  culture. The strawberries that grow wild in our pastures, woods, and  clearings, are several varieties, and bear abundantly. They make  excellent preserves, and I mean to introduce beds of them into my  garden. There is a pretty little wooded islet on our lake, that is  called Strawberry island, another Raspberry island; they abound in a  variety of fruits--wild grapes, raspberries, strawberries, black and red  currants, a wild gooseberry, and a beautiful little trailing plant that  bears white flowers like the raspberry, and a darkish purple fruit  consisting of a few grains of a pleasant brisk acid, somewhat like in  flavour to our dewberry, only not quite so sweet. The leaves of this  plant are of a"]]]
