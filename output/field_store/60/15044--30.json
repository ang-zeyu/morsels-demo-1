Here they were guided by a correct  feeling: the mysterious and sacred ought to be kept at an  awe-inspiring distance, but the human cannot be rightly understood if  seen without its usual accompaniments. In the middle ages all heroical  stories of antiquity, from Theseus and Achilles down to Alexander,  were metamorphosed into true tales of chivalry. What was related to  themselves spoke alone an intelligible language to them; of  differences and distinctions they did not care to know. In an old  manuscript of the _Iliad_, I saw a miniature illumination representing  Hector's funeral procession, where the coffin is hung with noble coats  of arms and carried into a Gothic church. It is easy to make merry  with this piece of simplicity, but a reflecting mind will see the  subject in a very different light. A powerful consciousness of the  universal validity and the solid permanency of their own manner of  being, an undoubting conviction that it has always so been and will  ever continue so to be in the world--these feelings of our ancestors  were symptoms of a fresh fulness of life; they were the marrow of  action in reality as well as in fiction. Their plain and affectionate  attachment to everything around them, handed down from their fathers,  is by no means to be confounded with the obstreperous conceit of ages  of mannerism, for they, out of vanity, introduce the fleeting modes  and fashion of the day into art, because to them everything like noble  simplicity seems boorish and rude. The latter impropriety is now  abolished: but, on the other hand, our poets and artists, if they  would hope for our approbation, must, like servants, wear the livery  of distant centuries and foreign nations. We are everywhere at home  except at home. We do ourselves the justice to allow that the present  mode of dressing, forms of politeness, etc., are altogether  unpoetical, and art is therefore obliged to beg, as an alms, a  poetical costume from the antiquaries. To that simple way of thinking,  which is merely attentive to the inward truth of the composition,  without stumbling at anachronisms or other external inconsistencies,  we cannot, alas! now return; but we must envy the poets to whom it  offered itself; it allowed them a great breadth and freedom in the  handling of their subject.    Many things in Shakespeare must be judged of according to the above  principles, respecting the difference between the essential and the  merely learned costume. They will also in their measure admit of an  application to Calderon.    So much with respect to the spirit of the age in which Shakespeare  lived, and his peculiar mental culture and knowledge. To me he appears  a profound artist, and not a blind and wildly luxuriant genius. I  consider, generally speaking, all that has been said on the subject a  mere fable, a blind and extravagant error. In other arts the assertion  refutes itself; for in them acquired knowledge is an indispensable  condition of clever execution. But even in such poets as are usually  given out as careless pupils of nature, devoid of art or school  discipline, I have always found, on a nearer consideration of the  works of real excellence they may have produced, even a high  cultivation of the mental powers, practice in art, and views both  worthy in themselves and maturely considered. This applies to Homer as  well as to Dante. The activity of genius is, it is true, natural to  it, and, in a certain sense, unconscious; and, consequently, the  person who possesses it is not always at the moment able to render an  account of the course which he may have pursued; but it by no means  follows that the thinking power had not a great share in it. It is  from the very rapidity and certainty of the mental process, from the  utmost clearness of understanding, that thinking in a poet is not  perceived as something abstracted, does not wear the appearance of  reflex meditation. That notion of poetical inspiration, which many  lyrical poets have brought into circulation, as if they were not in  their senses, and, like Pythia when possessed by the divinity,  delivered oracles unintelligible to themselves--this notion (a mere  lyrical invention) is least of all applicable to dramatic composition,  one of the most thoughtful productions of the human mind. It is  admitted that Shakespeare has reflected, and deeply reflected, on  character and passion, on the progress of events and human destinies,  on the human constitution, on all the things and relations of the  world; this is an admission which must be made, for one alone of  thousands of his maxims would be a sufficient refutation of any who  should attempt to deny it. So that it was only for the structure of  his own pieces that he had no thought to spare? This he left to the  dominion of chance, which blew together the atoms of Epicurus. But  supposing that, devoid of any higher ambition to approve himself to  judicious critics and posterity, and wanting in that love of art which  longs for self-satisfaction in the perfection of its works, he had  merely labored to please the unlettered crowd; still this very object  alone and the pursuit of theatrical effect would have led him to  bestow attention to the structure and adherence of his pieces. For  does not the impression of a drama depend in an especial manner on the  relation of the parts to one another? And, however beautiful a scene  may be in itself, if yet it be at variance with what the spectators  have been led to expect in its particular place, so as to destroy the  interest which they had hitherto felt, will it not be at once  reprobated by all who possess plain common sense and give themselves  up to nature? The comic intermixtures may be considered merely as a  sort of interlude, designed to relieve the straining of the mind after  the stretch of the more serious parts, so long as no better purpose  can be found in them; but in the progress of the main action, in the  concatenation of the events, the poet must, if possible, display even  more expenditure of thought than in the composition of individual  character and situations, otherwise he would be like the conductor of  a puppet-show who has so entangled his wires that the puppets receive  from their mechanism quite different movements from those which he  actually intended.    The English critics are unanimous in their praise of the truth and  uniform consistency of his characters, of his heartrending pathos, and  his comic wit. Moreover, they extol the beauty and sublimity of his  separate descriptions, images, and expressions. This last is the most  superficial and cheap mode of criticising works of art. Johnson  compares him who should endeavor to recommend this poet by passages  unconnectedly torn from his works, to the pedant in Hierocles, who  exhibited a brick as a sample of his house. And yet how little, and  how very unsatisfactorily does he himself speak of the pieces  considered as a whole! Let any man, for instance, bring together the  short characters which he gives at the close of each play, and see if  the aggregate will amount to that sum of admiration which he himself,  at his outset, has stated as the correct standard for the appreciation  of the poet. It was, generally speaking, the prevailing tendency of  the time which preceded our own, and which has showed itself  particularly in physical science, to consider everything having life  as a mere accumulation of dead parts, to separate what exists only in  connection and cannot otherwise be conceived, instead of penetrating  to the central point and viewing all the parts as so many irradiations  from it. Hence nothing is so rare as a critic who can elevate himself  to the comprehensive contemplation of a work of art. Shakespeare's  compositions, from the very depth of purpose displayed in them, have  been especially liable to the misfortune of being misunderstood.  Besides, this prosaic species of criticism requires always that the  poetic form should be applied to the details of execution; but when  the plan of the piece is concerned, it never looks for more than the  logical connection of causes and effects, or some partial and trite  moral by way of application; and all that cannot be reconciled  therewith is declared superfluous, or even a pernicious appendage. On  these principles we must even strike out from the Greek tragedies most  of the choral songs, which also contribute nothing to the development  of the action, but are merely an harmonious echo of the impressions  the poet aims at conveying. In this they altogether mistake the rights  of poetry and the nature of the romantic drama, which, for the very  reason that it is and ought to be picturesque, requires richer  accompaniments and contrasts for its main groups. In all Art and  Poetry, but more especially in the romantic, the Fancy lays claims to  be considered as an independent mental power governed according to its  own laws.    In an essay on _Romeo and Juliet_,[24] written a number of years ago,  I went through the whole of the scenes in their order and demonstrated  the inward necessity of each with reference to the whole; I showed why  such a particular circle of characters and relations was placed around  the two lovers; I explained the signification of the mirth here and  there scattered, and justified the use of the occasional heightening  given to the poetical colors. From all this it seemed to follow  unquestionably that, with the exception of a few criticisms, now  become unintelligible or foreign to the present taste (imitations of  the tone of society of that day), nothing could be taken away, nothing  added, nothing otherwise arranged, without mutilating and disfiguring  the perfect work.

We therefore leave the charge of stating the  case against him to Duncan, with whom he has never quarrelled.\"    Russell sat down amid general applause; he had performed his task with a  wonderful modesty and self-possession, which filled every one with  admiration, and Eric warmly pressed his hand.    The interest of the school was intensely excited, and Duncan, after a  minute's pause, starting up, said--\"Williams has allowed his desk to be  brought in and examined. Will Barker do the same?\"    The real culprit now saw at once that his plot to ruin Eric was  recoiling on himself. He got up, swore and blustered at Russell, Duncan,  and Williams, and at first flatly refused to allow his desk to be  brought. He was, however, forced to yield, and when opened, it was  immediately seen that the note-paper it contained was identical with  that on which the words had been written. At this he affected to be  perfectly unconcerned, and merely protested against what he called the  meanness of trying to fix the charge on him.    \"And what have you been doing the whole of the last day or two,\" asked  Gibson, quietly, \"but endeavoring to fix the charge on another?\"    \"We have stronger evidence against you,\" said Duncan, confronting him  with an undaunted look, before which his insolence quailed. \"Russell,  will you call Graham?\"    Graham was called, and put on his honor.    \"You were in the sick-room on Friday evening?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you see any one get into the school-room through the side window?\"    \"I may as well tell you all about it. I was sitting doing nothing in the  sick-room, when I suddenly saw Barker clamber in to the school-room by  the window, which he left open. I was looking on simply from curiosity,  and saw him search Williams' desk, from which he took out something, I  could not make out what. He then went to his own place, and wrote for  about ten minutes, after which I observed him go up and stand by the  notice board. When he had done this he got out by the window again,  and ran off.\"    \"Didn't this strike you as extraordinary?\"    \"No; I thought nothing more about it, till some one told me in the  sick-room about this row. I then mentioned privately what I had seen,  and it wasn't till I saw Duncan, half an hour ago, that I thought it  worth while to make it generally known.\"    Duncan turned an enquiring eye to Barker (who sat black and silent), and  then pulled some bits of torn paper from his pocket, put them together,  and called Owen to stand up. Showing him the fragments of paper, he  asked, \"Have you ever seen these before?\"    \"Yes. On Saturday, when the boys left the schoolroom, I stayed behind to  think a little over what had occurred, feeling convinced that Williams  was _not_ guilty, spite of appearances. I was standing by the empty  fire-place, when these bits of paper caught my eye. I picked them up,  and, after a great deal of trouble, fitted them together. They are  covered apparently with failures in an attempt at forgery, viz., first,  'Gordon is a sur--' and then a stop, as though the writer were  dissatisfied, and several of the words written over again for practice,  and then a number of r's made in the way that Williams makes them.\"    \"There you may stop,\" said Barker, stamping fiercely; \"I did it all.\"    A perfect yell of scorn and execration followed this announcement.    \"What! _you_ did it, and caused all this misery, you ineffable  blackguard!\" shouted Upton, grasping him with one hand, while he struck  him with the other.    \"Stop!\" said Avonley; \"just see that he doesn't escape, while we decide  on his punishment.\"    It was very soon decided by the sixth form that he should run the  gauntlet of the school. The boys instantly took out their handkerchiefs,  and knotted them tight. They then made a double line down each side of  the corridor, and turned Barker loose. He stood stock-still at one end,  while the fellows nearest him thrashed him unmercifully with the heavy  knots. At last the pain was getting severe, and he moved on, finally  beginning to run. Five times he was forced up and down the line, and  five times did every boy in the line give him a blow, which, if it did  not hurt much, at least spoke of no slight anger and contempt. He was  dogged and unmoved to the last, and then Avonley hauled him into the  presence of Dr. Rowlands. He was put in a secure room by himself, and  the next morning was first flogged and then publicly expelled.  Thenceforth he disappears from the history of Roslyn school.    I need hardly say that neither Eric nor his friends took any part in  this retributive act. They sat together in the boarders' room till it  was over, engaged in exciting discussion of the recent event. Most  warmly did Eric thank them for their trustfulness. \"Thank you,\" he said,  \"with all my heart, for proving my innocence; but thank you, even more a  great deal, for first believing it.\"    Upton was the first to join them, and since he had but wavered for a  moment, he was soon warmly reconciled with Eric. They had hardly shaken  hands when the rest came flocking in. \"We have all been unjust,\" said  Avonley; \"let's make up for it as well as we can. Three cheers for Eric  Williams!\"    They gave, not three, but a dozen, till they were tired; and meanwhile,  every one was pressing round him, telling him how sorry they were for  the false suspicion, and doing all they could to show their regret for  his recent troubles. His genial, boyish heart readily forgave them, and  his eyes were long wet with tears of joy. The delicious sensation of  returning esteem made him almost think it worth while to have under gone  his trial.    Most happily did he spend the remainder of that afternoon, and it was no  small relief to all the Rowlandites in the evening to find themselves  finally rid of Barker, whose fate no one pitied, and whose name no one  mentioned without disgust. He had done more than any other boy to  introduce meanness, quarrelling, and vice, and the very atmosphere of  the rooms seemed healthier in his absence. One boy only forgave him, one  boy only prayed for him, one boy only endeavored to see him for one last  kind word. That boy was Edwin Russell.    After prayers, Mr. Gordon, who had been at Dr. Rowlands' to dinner,  apologised to Eric amply and frankly for his note, and did and said all  that could be done by an honorable man to repair the injury of an unjust  doubt. Eric felt his generous humility, and from thenceforth, though  they were never friends, he and Mr. Gordon ceased to be enemies.    That night Mr. Rose crowned his happiness by asking him and his  defenders to supper in the library. A most bright and joyous evening  they passed, for they were in the highest spirits; and when the master  bade them \"good night,\" he kindly detained Eric, and said to him, \"Keep  an innocent heart, my boy, and you need never fear trouble. Only think  if you had been guilty, and were now in Barker's place!\"    \"O, I _couldn't_ be guilty, sir,\" said Eric, gaily.    \"Not of such a fault, perhaps. But,\" he added solemnly, \"there are many  kinds of temptation, Eric many kinds. And they are easy to fall into.  You will find it no light battle to resist them.\"    \"Believe me, sir, I will try,\" he answered with humility.    \"Jehovah-Nissi!\" said Mr. Rose. \"Let the Lord be your banner, Eric, and  you will win the victory. God bless you.\"    And as the boy's graceful figure disappeared through the door, Mr. Rose  drew his arm-chair to the fire, and sat and meditated long. He was  imagining for Eric a sunny future--a future of splendid usefulness, of  reciprocated love, of brilliant fame.        CHAPTER XIII    THE ADVENTURE AT THE STACK         \"Ten cables from where green meadows       And quiet homes could be seen,           No greater space           From peril to peace,       But the savage sea between!\"--EDWIN ARNOLD.    The Easter holidays at Roslyn lasted about ten days, and as most of the  boys came from a distance, they usually spent them at school. Many of  the usual rules were suspended during this time, and the boys were  supplied every day with pocket-money; consequently the Easter holidays  passed very pleasantly, and there was plenty of fun.    It was the great time for excursions all over the island, and the boys  would often be out the whole day long among the hills, or about the  coast. Eric enjoyed the time particularly, and was in great request  among all the boys. He was now more gay and popular than ever, and felt  as if nothing were wanting to his happiness. But this brilliant  prosperity was not good for him, and he felt continually that he cared  far less for the reproaches of conscience than he had done in the hours  of his trial; sought far less for help from God than he had done when he  was lonely and neglected.    He always knew that his great safeguard was the affection of Russell.  For Edwin's sake, and for shame at the thought of Edwin's disapproval,  he abstained from many things into which he would otherwise have  insensibly glided in conformation to the general looseness of the school  morality. But Russell's influence worked on him powerfully, and tended  to counteract a multitude of temptations.    Among other dangerous lessons, Upton had taught Eric to smoke; and he  was now one of those who often spent a part of his holidays in lurking  about with pipes in their mouths at places where they were unlikely to  be disturbed, instead of joining in some hearty and healthy game. When  he began to \"learn\" smoking, he found it anything but pleasant; but a  little practice had made him an adept, and he found a certain amount of  enjoyable excitement in finding out cozy places by the river, where he  and Upton might go and lounge for an hour to enjoy the forbidden luxury.    In reality he, like most boys, detested the habit; but it seemed"]]]
