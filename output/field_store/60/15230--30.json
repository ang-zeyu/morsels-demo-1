RONDELETIA.    The perfume bearing the above name is undoubtedly one of the most  gratifying to the smelling nerve that has ever been made. Its inventors,  Messrs. Hannay and Dietrichsen, have probably taken the _name_ of this  odor from the _Rondeletia_, the _Chyn-len_ of the Chinese; or from the  R. odorata of the West Indies, which has a sweet odor. We have before  observed that there is a similarity of effect upon the olfactory nerve  produced by certain odors, although derived from totally different  sources: that, for instance, otto of almonds may be mixed with extract  of violet in such proportion that, although the odor is increased, yet  the character peculiar to the violet is not destroyed. Again: there are  certain odors which, on being mixed in due proportion, produce a new  aroma, perfectly distinct and peculiar to itself. This effect is  exemplified by comparison with the influence of certain colors when  mixed, upon the nerve of vision: such, for instance, as when yellow and  blue are mixed, the result we call green; or when blue and red are  united, the compound color is known as puce or violet.    Now when the odor of lavender and odor of cloves are mixed, they produce  a new fragrance, _i.e._ Rondeletia! It is such combinations that  constitute in reality \"a new perfume,\" which, though often advertised,  is very rarely attained. Jasmine and patchouly produce a novel aroma,  and many others in like manner; proportion and relative strength, when  so mixed, must of course be studied, and the substances used  accordingly. If the same quantity of any given otto be dissolved in a  like proportion of spirit, and the solution be mixed in equal  proportions, the strongest odor is instantly indicated by covering or  hiding the presence of the other. In this way we discover that  patchouly, lavender, neroli, and verbena are the most potent of the  vegetable odors, and that violet, tubereuse, and jasmine are the most  delicate.    Many persons will at first consider that we are asking too much, when we  express a desire to have the same deference paid to the olfactory nerve,  as to the other nerves that influence our physical pleasures and pains.  By tutoring the olfactory nerve, it is capable of perceiving matter in  the atmosphere of the most subtle nature: not only that which is  pleasant, but also such as are unhealthful. If an unpleasant odor is a  warning to seek a purer atmosphere, surely it is worth while to  cultivate that power which enables us to act up to that warning for the  general benefit of health.    To return, however, to Rondeletia: it will be seen by the annexed  formulae, that, besides the main ingredients to which it owes its  peculiar character--that is, cloves and lavender--it contains musk,  vanilla, &c. These substances are used in these as in nearly all other  bouquets for the sole purpose of fixing the more volatile odors to the  handkerchief.    ESSENCE OF RONDELETIA.

The just reputation of this perfume places it in the first rank of the  very best mixtures that have ever been made by any manufacturing  perfumer. Its odor is truly flowery, but peculiar to itself. Being  unlike any other aroma it cannot well be imitated, chiefly because there  is nothing that we are acquainted with that at all resembles the odor of  the esprit de rose, as derived from macerating rose pomade in spirit, to  which, and to the extract of violet, nicely counterpoised, so that  neither odor predominates, the peculiar character of \"Spring Flowers\" is  due; the little ambergris that is present gives permanence to the odor  upon the handkerchief, although from the very nature of the ingredients  it may be said to be a fleeting odor. \"Spring Flowers\" is an  Englishman's invention, but there is scarcely a perfumer in Europe that  does not attempt an imitation.      TULIP NOSEGAY.    Nearly all the tulip tribe, although beautiful to the eye, are  inodorous. The variety called the Duc Van Thol, however, yields an  exquisite perfume, but it is not used by the manufacturer for the  purpose of extracting its odor. He, however, borrows its poetical name,  and makes an excellent imitation thus:--    Extract of tubereuse, } from pomade each,       1 pint.    \"        violet,    }    \"        rose,                                1/2 \"    \"        orris,                                 3 oz.  Otto of almonds,                               3 drops.      VIOLETTE DES BOIS.    Under the head Violet, we have already explained the method of preparing  the extract or essence of that modest flower. The Parisian perfumers  sell a mixture of violet, which is very beautiful, under the title of  the Violet des Bois, or the Wood Violet, which is made thus:--    Extract of violet,                             1 pint.  \"          orris,                                3 oz.  \"          cassie,                               3 oz.  \"          rose (from pomade)                    3 oz.  Otto of almonds,                              3 drops.    This mixture, in a general way, gives more satisfaction to the customer  than the pure violet.    WINDSOR CASTLE BOUQUET.

We have now completed the branch of the Art of Perfumery which relates  to handkerchief perfumes, or wet perfumery. Although we have rather too  much encroached upon the space of this work in giving the composition of  so many bouquets, yet there are many left unnoticed which are popular.  Those that are given are noted more particularly for the peculiar  character of their odor, and are selected from more than a thousand  recipes that have been practically tried.    Those readers who require to know anything about the simple extracts of  flowers are referred to them under their respective alphabetical titles.          SECTION VII.      The previous articles have exclusively treated of Wet Perfumes; the  present matter relates, to Dry Perfumes,--sachet powders, tablets,  pastilles, fumigation by the aid of heat of volatile odorous resins, &c.  &c. The perfumes used by the ancients were, undoubtedly, nothing more  than the odoriferous gums which naturally exude from various trees and  shrubs indigenous to the Eastern hemisphere: that they were very  extensively used and much valued, we have only to read the Scriptures  for proofs:--\"Who is this that cometh ... perfumed with myrrh and  frankincense, with all the powders of the merchant?\" (Song of Solomon,  3:6.) Abstaining from the use of perfume in Eastern countries is  considered as a sign of humiliation:--\"The Lord will take away the  tablets, and it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there  shall be a stink.\" (Exod. 35:22; Isaiah 3:20, 24.) The word tablets in  this passage means perfume boxes, curiously inlaid, made of metal, wood,  and ivory. Some of these boxes may have been made in the shape of  buildings, which would explain the word _palaces_, in Psalm 14:8:--\"All  thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory  palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\" From what is said in Matt.  2:11, it would appear that perfumes were considered among the most  valuable gifts which man could bestow;--\"And when they (the wise men)  had opened their treasures, they presented unto him (Christ) gifts;  gold,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#20)"],[1," of use to us.  After leaving  these charming islands protected by the French flag, from the 4th to  the 11th of December the Nautilus sailed over about 2,000 miles.    During the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in the  large drawing-room. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous water  through the half-open panels.  The Nautilus was immovable.  While its  reservoirs were filled, it kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a region  rarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen.    I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the  Stomach, and I was learning some valuable lessons from it, when Conseil  interrupted me.    \"Will master come here a moment?\" he said, in a curious voice.    \"What is the matter, Conseil?\"    \"I want master to look.\"    I rose, went, and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched.    In a full electric light, an enormous black mass, quite immovable, was  suspended in the midst of the waters.  I watched it attentively,  seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean.  But a sudden  thought crossed my mind.  \"A vessel!\" I said, half aloud.    \"Yes,\" replied the Canadian, \"a disabled ship that has sunk  perpendicularly.\"    Ned Land was right; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered  shrouds still hung from their chains.  The keel seemed to be in good  order, and it had been wrecked at most some few hours.  Three stumps of  masts, broken off about two feet above the bridge, showed that the  vessel had had to sacrifice its masts.  But, lying on its side, it had  filled, and it was heeling over to port.  This skeleton of what it had  once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves, but  sadder still was the sight of the bridge, where some corpses, bound  with ropes, were still lying.  I counted five--four men, one of whom  was standing at the helm, and a woman standing by the poop, holding an  infant in her arms.  She was quite young.  I could distinguish her  features, which the water had not decomposed, by the brilliant light  from the Nautilus.  In one despairing effort, she had raised her infant  above her head--poor little thing!--whose arms encircled its mother's  neck.  The attitude of the four sailors was frightful, distorted as  they were by their convulsive movements, whilst making a last effort to  free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel.  The  steersman alone, calm, with a grave, clear face, his grey hair glued to  his forehead, and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm, seemed even  then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the  ocean.    What a scene!  We were dumb; our hearts beat fast before this  shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last  moments.  And I saw already, coming towards it with hungry eyes,  enormous sharks, attracted by the human flesh.    However, the Nautilus, turning, went round the submerged vessel, and in  one instant I read on the stern--\"The Florida, Sunderland.\"        CHAPTER XVIII    VANIKORO    This terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime  catastrophes that the Nautilus was destined to meet with in its route.  As long as it went through more frequented waters, we often saw the  hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, and  deeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, and a thousand other  iron materials eaten up by rust.  However, on the 11th of December we  sighted the Pomotou Islands, the old \"dangerous group\" of Bougainville,  that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from the  Island Ducie to that of Lazareff.  This group covers an area of 370  square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, among  which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises  sway.  These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created  by the daily work of polypi.  Then this new island will be joined later  on to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch from  New Zealand and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas.    One day, when I was suggesting this theory to Captain Nemo, he replied  coldly:    \"The earth does not want new continents, but new men.\"    Chance had conducted the Nautilus towards the Island of  Clermont-Tonnere, one of the most curious of the group, that was  discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva. I could study now  the madreporal system, to which are due the islands in this ocean.    Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals) have a tissue lined  with a calcareous crust, and the modifications of its structure have  induced M. Milne Edwards, my worthy master, to class them into five  sections. The animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by  millions at the bottom of their cells. Their calcareous deposits become  rocks, reefs, and large and small islands. Here they form a ring,  surrounding a little inland lake, that communicates with the sea by  means of gaps. There they make barriers of reefs like those on the  coasts of New Caledonia and the various Pomoton islands. In other  places, like those at Reunion and at Maurice, they raise fringed reefs,  high, straight walls, near which the depth of the ocean is considerable.    Some cable-lengths off the shores of the Island of Clermont I admired  the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers. These  walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas,  porites, madrepores, and astraeas. These polypi are found particularly  in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is  from the upper part that they begin their operations, in which they  bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that  support them. Such is, at least, Darwin's theory, who thus explains the  formation of the _atolls_, a superior theory (to my mind) to that given  of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or  volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea.    I could observe closely these curious walls, for perpendicularly they  were more than 300 yards deep, and our electric sheets lighted up this  calcareous matter brilliantly. Replying to a question Conseil asked me  as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised, I astonished  him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth  of an inch in a hundred years.    Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the distance, and the  route of the Nautilus was sensibly changed. After having crossed the  tropic of Capricorn in 135 deg. longitude, it sailed W.N.W., making  again for the tropical zone. Although the summer sun was very strong,  we did not suffer from heat, for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the  surface, the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees.    On 15th of December, we left to the east the bewitching group of the  Societies and the graceful Tahiti, queen of the Pacific.  I saw in the  morning, some miles to the windward, the elevated summits of the  island.  These waters furnished our table with excellent fish,  mackerel, bonitos, and some varieties of a sea-serpent.    On the 25th of December the Nautilus sailed into the midst of the New  Hebrides, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and that Bougainville explored  in 1768, and to which Cook gave its present name in 1773.  This group  is composed principally of nine large islands, that form a band of 120  leagues N.N.S. to S.S.W., between 15 deg. and 2 deg. S. lat., and 164  deg. and 168 deg. long.  We passed tolerably near to the Island of  Aurou, that at noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a  peak of great height.    That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to regret sorely the  non-celebration of \"Christmas,\" the family fete of which Protestants  are so fond.  I had not seen Captain Nemo for a week, when, on the  morning of the 27th, he came into the large drawing-room, always  seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before.  I was busily  tracing the route of the Nautilus on the planisphere.  The Captain came  up to me, put his finger on one spot on the chart, and said this single  word.    \"Vanikoro.\"    The effect was magical!  It was the name of the islands on which La  Perouse had been lost!  I rose suddenly.    \"The Nautilus has brought us to Vanikoro?\"  I asked.    \"Yes, Professor,\" said the Captain.    \"And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the  Astrolabe struck?\"    \"If you like, Professor.\"    \"When shall we be there?\"    \"We are there now.\"    Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily  scanned the horizon.    To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by  a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference.  We were close  to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d'Urville gave the name of  Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou,  situated in 16 deg. 4' S. lat., and 164 deg. 32' E. long.  The earth  seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the  interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high.  The  Nautilus, having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait,  found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty  fathoms deep.  Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived  some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach.  In the  long black body, moving between wind and water, did they not see some  formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?    Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the wreck of La  Perouse.    \"Only what everyone knows, Captain,\" I replied.    \"And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?\" he inquired,  ironically.    \"Easily.\"    I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d'Urville had made  known--works from which the following is a brief account.    La Perouse, and "]]]
