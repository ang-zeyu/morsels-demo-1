Now hear briefly the signification.         \"This animal in truth signifies God;   Know that the virgin signifies St Mary;   By her breast we understand similarly Holy Church;   And then by the kiss it ought to signify,   That a man when he sleeps is in semblance of death;   God slept as man, who suffered death on the cross,   And his destruction was our redemption,   And his labour our repose,   Thus God deceived the Devil by a proper semblance;   Soul and body were one, so was God and man,   And this is the signification of an animal of that description.\"(1)      (1) _Popular Treatises on Science written during the Middle Ages  in Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Norman, and English_, ed. by THOMAS WRIGHT  (Historical Society of Science, 1841), pp. 81-82.    This being the current belief concerning the symbolism of the unicorn  in the Middle Ages, it is not surprising to find this animal utilised in  church architecture; for an example see fig. 35.    The belief in the existence of these fabulous beasts may very probably  have been due to the materialising of what were originally nothing  more than mere arbitrary symbols, as I have already suggested of the  phoenix.(1) Thus the account of the mantichora may, as BOSTOCK has  suggested, very well be a description of certain hieroglyphic figures,  examples of which are still to be found in the ruins of Assyrian and  Persian cities. This explanation seems, on the whole, more likely  than the alternative hypothesis that such beliefs were due to  mal-observation; though that, no doubt, helped in their formation.      (1) \"Superstitions concerning Birds.\"      It may be questioned, however, whether the architects and preachers  of the Middle Ages altogether believed in the strange fables of the  Bestiaries. As Mr COLLINS says in reply to this question: \"Probably they  were credulous enough. But, on the whole, we may say that the truth of  the story was just what they did not trouble about, any more than some  clergymen are particular about the absolute truth of the stories they  tell children from the pulpit. The application, the lesson, is the  thing!\" With their desire to interpret Nature spiritually, we ought,  I think, to sympathise. But there was one truth they had yet to learn,  namely, that in order to interpret Nature spiritually, it is necessary  first to understand her aright in her literal sense.          IX. THE QUEST OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE    THE need of unity is a primary need of human thought. Behind the  varied multiplicity of the world of phenomena, primitive man, as I  have indicated on a preceding excursion, begins to seek, more or less  consciously, for that Unity which alone is Real. And this statement not  only applies to the first dim gropings of the primitive human mind,  but sums up almost the whole of science and philosophy; for almost all  science and philosophy is explicitly or implicitly a search for unity,  for one law or one love, one matter or one spirit. That which is the aim  of the search may, indeed, be expressed under widely different terms,  but it is always conceived to be the unity in which all multiplicity is  resolved, whether it be thought of as one final law of necessity, which  all things obey, and of which all the various other \"laws of nature\" are  so many special and limited applications; or as one final love for which  all things are created, and to which all things aspire; as one matter of  which all bodies are but varying forms; or as one spirit, which is the  life of all things, and of which all things are so many manifestations.  Every scientist and philosopher is a merchant seeking for goodly pearls,  willing to sell every pearl that he has, if he may secure the One Pearl  beyond price, because he knows that in that One Pearl all others are  included.    This search for unity in multiplicity, however, is not confined to  the acknowledged scientist and philosopher. More or less unconsciously  everyone is engaged in this quest. Harmony and unity are the very  fundamental laws of the human mind itself, and, in a sense, all mental  activity is the endeavour to bring about a state of harmony and unity  in the mind. No two ideas that are contradictory of one another, and are  perceived to be of this nature, can permanently exist in any sane man's  mind. It is true that many people try to keep certain portions of their  mental life in water-tight compartments; thus some try to keep their  religious convictions and their business ideas, or their religious  faith and their scientific knowledge, separate from another one--and, it  seems, often succeed remarkably well in so doing. But, ultimately, the  arbitrary mental walls they have erected will break down by the force  of their own ideas. Contradictory ideas from different compartments will  then present themselves to consciousness at the same moment of time,  and the result of the perception of their contradictory nature will  be mental anguish and turmoil, persisting until one set of ideas is  conquered and overcome by the other, and harmony and unity are restored.    It is true of all of us, then, that we seek for Unity--unity in mind and  life. Some seek it in science and a life of knowledge; some seek it in  religion and a life of faith; some seek it in human love and find it in  the life of service to their fellows; some seek it in pleasure and the  gratification of the senses' demands; some seek it in the harmonious  development of all the facets of their being. Many the methods, right  and wrong; many the terms under which the One is conceived, true  and false--in a sense, to use the phraseology of a bygone system of  philosophy, we are all, consciously or unconsciously, following paths  that lead thither or paths that lead away, seekers in the quest of the  Philosopher's Stone.    Let us, in these excursions in the byways of thought, consider for a  while the form that the quest of fundamental unity took in the hands  of those curious mediaeval philosophers, half mystics, half  experimentalists in natural things--that are known by the name of  \"alchemists.\"    The common opinion concerning alchemy is that it was a pseudo-science or  pseudo-art flourishing during the Dark Ages, and having for its aim  the conversion of common metals into silver and gold by means of a most  marvellous and wholly fabulous agent called the Philosopher's Stone,  that its devotees were half knaves, half fools, whose views concerning  Nature were entirely erroneous, and whose objects were entirely  mercenary. This opinion is not absolutely destitute of truth; as a  science alchemy involved many fantastic errors; and in the course of its  history it certainly proved attractive to both knaves and fools. But if  this opinion involves some element of truth, it involves a far greater  proportion of error. Amongst the alchemists are numbered some of the  greatest intellects of the Middle Ages--ROGER BACON (_c_. 1214-1294),  for example, who might almost be called the father of experimental  science. And whether or not the desire for material wealth was a  secondary object, the true aim of the genuine alchemist was a much  nobler one than this as one of them exclaims with true scientific  fervour: \"Would to God... all men might become adepts in our Art--for  then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its value, and we  should prize it only for its scientific teaching.\"(1) Moreover, recent  developments in physical and chemical science seem to indicate that the  alchemists were not so utterly wrong in their concept of Nature as has  formerly been supposed--that, whilst they certainly erred in both their  methods and their interpretations of individual phenomena, they did  intuitively grasp certain fundamental facts concerning the universe  ofthe very greatest importance.      (1) EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES: _An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the  King_. (See _The Hermetic Museum, Restored and Enlarged_, ed. by A. E.  WAITE, 1893, vol. ii. p. 178.)      Suppose, however, that the theories of the alchemists are entirely  erroneous from beginning to end, and are nowhere relieved by the merest  glimmer of truth. Still they were believed to be true, and this belief  had an important influence upon human thought. Many men of science  have, I am afraid, been too prone to regard the mystical views of the  alchemists as unintelligible; but, whatever their theories may be to us,  these theories were certainly very real to them: it is preposterous to  maintain that the writings of the alchemists are without meaning, even  though their views are altogether false. And the more false their views  are believed to be, the more necessary does it become to explain why  they should have gained such universal credit. Here we have problems  into which scientific inquiry is not only legitimate, but, I think, very  desirable,--apart altogether from the question of the truth or falsity  of alchemy as a science, or its utility as an art. What exactly was the  system of beliefs grouped under the term \"alchemy,\" and what was its  aim? Why were the beliefs held? What was their precise influence upon  human thought and culture?    It was in order to elucidate problems of this sort, as well as to  determine what elements of truth, if any, there are in the theories of  the alchemists, that The Alchemical Society was founded in 1912, mainly  through my own efforts and those of my confreres, and for the first time  something like justice was being done to the memory of the alchemists  when the Society's activities were stayed by that greatest calamity of  history, the European War.    Some students of the writings of the alchemists have advanced a very  curious and interesting theory as to the aims of the alchemists, which  may be termed \"the transcendental "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#20)"],[1,"falling down.    Anon, King Arthur spied where Lucius fought and worked great deeds of  prowess with his own hands. Forthwith he rode at him, and each attacked  the other passing fiercely; till at the last, Lucius struck King Arthur  with a fearful wound across the face, and Arthur, in return, lifting up  Excalibur on high, drove it with all his force upon the Emperor's head,  shivering his helmet, crashing his head in halves, and splitting his body  to the breast. And when the Romans saw their Emperor dead they fled in  hosts of thousands; and King Arthur and his knights, and all his army  followed them, and slew one hundred thousand men.    Then returning to the field, King Arthur rode to the place where Lucius  lay dead, and round him the kings of Egypt and Ethiopia, and seventeen  other kings, with sixty Roman senators, all noble men. All these he  ordered to be carefully embalmed with aromatic gums, and laid in leaden  coffins, covered with their shields and arms and banners. Then calling for  three senators who were taken prisoners, he said to them, \"As the ransom  of your lives, I will that ye take these dead bodies and carry them to  Rome, and there present them for me, with these letters saying I will  myself be shortly there. And I suppose the Romans will beware how they  again ask tribute of me; for tell them, these dead bodies that I send them  are for the tribute they have dared to ask of me; and if they wish for  more, when I come I will pay them the rest.\"    So, with that charge, the three senators departed with the dead bodies,  and went to Rome; the body of the Emperor being carried in a chariot  blazoned with the arms of the empire, all alone, and the bodies of the  kings two and two in chariots following.    After the battle, King Arthur entered Lorraine, Brabant, and Flanders, and  thence, subduing all the countries as he went, passed into Germany, and so  beyond the mountains into Lombardy and Tuscany. At length he came before a  city which refused to obey him, wherefore he sat down before it to besiege  it. And after a long time thus spent, King Arthur called Sir Florence,  and told him they began to lack food for his hosts--\"And not far from  hence,\" said he, \"are great forests full of cattle belonging to my  enemies. Go then, and bring by force all that thou canst find; and take  with thee Sir Gawain, my nephew, and Sir Clegis, Sir Claremond the Captain  of Cardiff, and a strong band.\"    Anon, those knights made ready, and rode over holts and hills, and through  forests and woods, till they came to a great meadow full of fair flowers  and grass, and there they rested themselves and their horses that night.  And at the dawn of the next day, Sir Gawain took his horse and rode away  from his fellows to seek some adventure. Soon he saw an armed knight  walking his horse by a wood's side, with his shield laced to his shoulder,  and no attendant with him save a page, bearing a mighty spear; and on his  shield were blazoned three gold griffins. When Sir Gawain spied him, he  put his spear in rest, and riding straight to him, asked who he was. \"A  Tuscan,\" said he; \"and they mayest prove me when thou wilt, for thou shalt  be my prisoner ere we part.\"    Then said Sir Gawain, \"Thou vauntest thee greatly, and speakest proud  words; yet I counsel thee, for all thy boastings, look to thyself the best  thou canst.\"    At that they took their spears and ran at each other with all the might  they had, and smote each other through their shields into their shoulders;  and then drawing swords smote with great strokes, till the fire sprang out  of their helms. Then was Sir Gawain enraged, and with his good sword  Galotine struck his enerny through shield and hauberk, and splintered into  pieces all the precious stones of it, and made so huge a wound that men  might see both lungs and liver. At that the Tuscan, groaning loudly,  rushed on to Sir Gawain, and gave him a deep slanting stroke, and made a  mighty wound and cut a great vein asunder, so that he bled fast. Then he  cried out, \"Bind thy wound quickly up, Sir knight, for thou be-bloodest  all thy horse and thy fair armour, and all the surgeons of the world shall  never staunch thy blood; for so shall it be to whomsoever is hurt with  this good sword.\"    Then answered Sir Gawain, \"It grieveth me but little, and thy boastful  words give me no fear, for thou shalt suffer greater grief and sorrow ere  we part; but tell me quickly who can staunch this blood.\"    \"That can I do,\" said the strange knight, \"and will, if thou wilt aid and  succour me to become christened, and to believe on God, which now I do  require of thee upon thy manhood.\"    \"I am content,\" said Sir Gawain; \"and may God help me to grant all thy  wishes. But tell mefirst, what soughtest thou thus here alone, and of what  land art thou?\"    \"Sir,\" said the knight, \"my name is Prianius, and my father is a great  prince, who hath rebelled against Rome. He is descended from Alexander and  Hector, and of our lineage also were Joshua and Maccabaeus. I am of right  the king of Alexandria, and Africa, and all the outer isles, yet I would  believe in the Lord thou worshippest, and for thy labour I will give thee  treasure enough. I was so proud in heart that I thought none my equal, but  now have I encountered with thee, who hast given me my fill of fighting;  wherefore, I pray thee, Sir knight, tell me of thyself.\"    \"I am no knight,\" said Sir Gawain; \"I have been brought up many years in  the wardrobe of the noble prince King Arthur, to mind his armour and  array.\"    \"Ah,\" said Prianius, \"if his varlets be so keen and fierce, his knights  must be passing good! Now, for the love of heaven, whether thou be knight  or knave, tell me thy name.\"    \"By heaven!\" said Gawain, \"now will I tell thee the truth. My name is Sir  Gawain, and I am a knight of the Round Table.\"    \"Now am I better pleased,\" said Prianius, \"than if thou hadst given me all  the province of Paris the rich. I had rather have been torn by wild horses  than that any varlet should have won such victory over me as thou hast  done. But now, Sir knight, I warn thee that close by is the Duke of  Lorraine, with sixty thousand good men of war; and we had both best flee  at once, for he will find us else, and we be sorely wounded and never  likely to recover. And let my page be careful that he blow no horn, for  hard by are a hundred knights, my servants; and if they seize thee, no  ransom of gold or silver would acquit thee.\"    Then Sir Gawain rode over a river to save himself, and Sir Prianius after  him, and so they both fled till they came to his companions who were in  the meadow, where they spent the night. When Sir Whishard saw Sir Gawain  so hurt, he ran to him weeping, and asked him who it was had wounded him;  and Sir Gawain told him how he had fought with that man--pointing to  Prianius--who had salves to heal them both. \"But I can tell ye other  tidings,\" said he--\"that soon we must encounter many enemies, for a great  army is close to us in our front.\"    Then Prianius and Sir Gawain alighted and let their horses graze while  they unarmed, and when they took their armour and their clothing off, the  hot blood ran down freshly from their wounds till it was piteous to see.  But Prianius took from his page a vial filled from the four rivers that  flow out of Paradise, and anointed both their wounds with a certain balm,  and washed them with that water, and within an hour afterwards they were  both as sound and whole as ever they had been. Then, at the sound of a  trumpet, all the knights were assembled to council; and after much  talking, Prianius said, \"Cease your words, for I warn you in yonder wood  ye shall find knights out of number, who will put out cattle for a decoy  to lead you on; and ye are not seven hundred!\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said Sir Gawain, \"let us at once encounter them, and see  what they can do; and may the best have the victory.\"    Then they saw suddenly an earl named Sir Ethelwold, and the Duke of  Duchmen come leaping out of ambush of the woods in front, with many a  thousand after them, and all rode straight down to the battle. And Sir  Gawain, full of ardour and courage, comforted his knights, saying, \"They  all are ours.\" Then the seven hundred knights, in one close company, set  spurs to their horses and began to gallop, and fiercely met their enemies.  And then were men and horses slain and overthrown on every side, and in  and out amidst them all, the knights of the Round Table pressed and  thrust, and smote down to the earth all who withstood them, till at length  the whole of them turned back and fled.    \"By heaven!\" said Sir Gawain, \"this gladdeneth well my heart, for now  behold them as they flee! they are full seventy thousand less in number  than they were an hour ago!\"    Thus was the battle quickly ended, and a great host of high lords and  knights of Lombardy and Saracens left dead upon the field. Then Sir Gawain  and his company collected a great plenty of cattle, and of gold and  silver, and all kind of treasure, and returned to King Arthur, where he  still kept the siege.    \"Now God be thanked,\" cried he; \"but who is he that standeth yonder by  himself, and seemeth not a prisoner?\"    \"Sir,\" said Sir Gawain, \"he is a good man with his weapons, and hath  matched me; but cometh hither to be made a Christian. Had it not been for  his warnings, we none of us should have been here this day. I pray thee,  therefore, let him be baptized, for there can be few nobler men, or better  knights.\"    So Prianius was christened, and made a duke and knight of the Round Table.    [Illustration: Prianius was christened, and made a duke and knight of the  Round Table.]    Presently afterwards, they made a last attack upon the city, and entered  by the walls on every side; and as the men were rushing to the pillage,  came the Duchess forth, with many ladies and damsels, and kneeled before"]]]
