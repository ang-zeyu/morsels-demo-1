Why pray for what we do not strive to gain?    Like merchants on the swollen Ganges' bank    Praying the farther shore to come to them,    Taking no steps, seeking no means, to cross.    Far better strive to cast out greed and hate.    Live not for self, but live for others' good.    Indulge no bitter speech, no bitter thoughts.    Help those in need; give freely what we have.    Kill not, steal not, and ever speak the truth.    Indulge no lust; taste not the maddening bowl    That deadens sense and stirs all base desires;    And live in charity and gentle peace,    Bearing all meekly, loving those who hate.    This is the way to Brahma Loca's rest.    And ye who may, come, follow after me.    Leave wealth and home and all the joys of life,    That we may aid a sad and suffering world    In sin and sorrow groping blindly on,    Becoming poor that others may be rich,    Wanderers ourselves to lead the wanderers home.    And ye who stay, ever remember this:    That hearth is Brahma's altar where love reigns,    That house is Brahma's temple where love dwells,    Ye ask, my aged friends, if death can break    The bonds that bind your souls in wedded love.    Fear not; death has no power to conquer love.    Go hand in hand till death shall claim his own,    Then hand in hand ascend Nirvana's heights,    There, hand in hand, heart beating close to heart,    Enter that life whose joys shall never end,    Perennial youth succeeding palsied age,    Mansions of bliss for this poor house of clay,    Labors of love instead of toil and tears.\"      He spoke, and many to each other said:    \"Why hear this babbler rail at sacred things--    Our caste, our faith, our prayers and sacred hymns?\"    And strode away in proud and sovereign scorn;    While some with gladness heard his solemn words,    All soon forgotten in the giddy whirl    Of daily business, daily joys and cares.    But some drank in his words with eager ears,    And asked him many questions, lingering long,    And often sought him in the sacred grove    To hear his burning words of living truth.    And day by day some noble Brahman youth    Forsook his wealth, forsook his home and friends,    And took the yellow robe and begging-bowl    To ask for alms where all had given him place,    Meeting with gentleness the rabble's gibes,    Meeting with smiles the Brahman's haughty scorn.    Thus, day by day, this school of prophets grew,    Beneath the banyan's columned, vaulted shade,    All earnest learners at the master's feet,    Until the city's busy, bustling throng    Had come to recognize the yellow robe,    The poor to know its wearer as a friend,    The sick and suffering as a comforter,    While to the dying pilgrim's glazing eyes    He seemed a messenger from higher worlds    Come down to raise his sinking spirit up    And guide his trembling steps to realms of rest.      A year has passed, and of this growing band    Sixty are rooted, grounded in the faith,    Willing to do whate'er the master bids,    Ready to go where'er the master sends,    Eager to join returning pilgrim-bands    And bear the truth to India's farthest bounds.      With joy the master saw their burning zeal,    So free from selfishness, so full of love,    And thought of all those blindly groping souls    To whom these messengers would bear the light.      \"Go,\" said the master, \"each a different way.    Go teach the common brotherhood of man.    Preach Dharma, preach the law of perfect love,    One law for high and low, for rich and poor.    Teach all to shun the cudgel and the sword,    And treat with kindness every living thing.    Teach them to shun all theft and craft and greed,    All bitter thoughts, and false and slanderous speech    That severs friends and stirs up strife and hate.    Revere your own, revile no brother's faith.    The light you see is from Nirvana's Sun,    Whose rising splendors promise perfect day.    The feeble rays that light your brother's path    Are from the selfsame Sun, by falsehoods hid,    The lingering shadows of the passing night.    Chide none with ignorance, but teach the truth    Gently, as mothers guide their infants' steps,    Lest your rude manners drive them from the way    That leads to purity and peace and rest--    As some rude swain in some sequestered vale,    Who thinks the visual line that girts him round    The world's extreme, would meet with sturdy blows    One rudely charging him with ignorance,    Yet gently led to some commanding height,    Whence he could see the Himalayan peaks,    The rolling hills and India's spreading plains,    With joyful wonder views the glorious scene.    Pause not to break the idols of the past.    Be guides and leaders, not iconoclasts.    Their broken idols shock their worshipers,    But led to light they soon forgotten lie.\"      One of their number, young and strong and brave,    A merchant ere he took the yellow robe,    Had crossed the frozen Himalayan heights    And found a race, alien in tongue and blood,    Gentle as children in their daily lives,    Untaught as children in all sacred things,    Living in wagons, wandering o'er the steppes,    To-day all shepherds, tending countless flocks,    To-morrow warriors, cruel as the grave,    Building huge monuments of human heads--    Fearless, resistless, with the cyclone's speed    Leaving destruction in their bloody track,    Who drove the Aryan from his native plains    To seek a home in Europe's trackless wastes.    He yearned to seek these children of the wilds,    And teach them peace and gentleness and love.[11]    \"But, Purna,\" said the master, \"they are fierce.    How will you meet their cruelty and wrath?\"    Purna replied, \"With gentleness and love.\"    \"But,\" said the master, \"they may beat and wound.\"    \"And I will give them thanks to spare my life.\"    \"But with slow tortures they may even kill.\"    \"I with my latest breath will bless their names,    So soon to free me from this prison-house    And send me joyful to the other shore.\"    \"Then,\" said the master, \"Purna, it is well.    Armed with such patience, seek these savage tribes.    Thyself delivered, free from karma's chains    These souls enslaved; thyself consoled, console    These restless children of the desert wastes;    Thyself this peaceful haven having reached,    Guide these poor wanderers to the other shore.\"      With many counsels, many words of cheer,    He on their mission sent his brethren forth,    Armed with a prophet's zeal, a brother's love,    A martyr's courage, and the Christian's hope    That when life's duties end, its trials end,    And higher life awaits those faithful found.      The days pass on; and now the rising sun    Looks down on bands of pilgrims homeward bound,    Some moving north, some south, some east, some west,    Toward every part of India's vast expanse,    One clothed in orange robes with every band    To guide their kindred on the upward road.      But Purna joined the merchants he had led,    Not moved by thirst for gain, but love for man,    To seek the Tartar on his native steppes.      Meanwhile the master with diminished band    Crossing the Ganges, backward wends his way    Toward Rajagriha, and the vulture-peak    Where he had spent so many weary years,    Whither he bade the brothers gather in[12]    When summer's rains should bring the time for rest.      [1]Varanassi is an old name of Benares.    [2]It can be no exaggeration to put the number of sacred edifices that  burst upon Buddha's view as he first saw the holy city, at 1,000, as  Phillips Brooks puts the present number of such edifices in Benares at  5,000.    [3]In this marriage-feast three well-known incidents in the life of  Buddha and his teaching's on the three occasions are united.    [4]For the best description of the banyan-tree, see Lady Dufferin's  account of the old tree at their out-of-town place in \"Our Viceroyal  Life in India,\" and \"Two Years in Ceylon,\" by C.F. Gordon Cumming.    [5]Those who saw the illuminations at Chicago during the World's fair,  with lines of incandescent electric lights, can get a good idea of the  great illuminations in India with innumerable oil lamps, and those who  did not should read Lady Dufferin's charming description of them in  \"Our Viceroyal Life in India.\"    [6]Lady Dufferin says that the viceroy never wearied, in his admiration  of the graceful flowing robes of the East as contrasted with our stiff,  fashion-plate male attire.    [7]\"The good Lord could not be everywhere and therefore made  mothers.\"--Jewish saying from the Talmud.    [8]Max Mueller calls attention to the remarkable fact that Dyaus  Pittar, the highest name of deity among the ancient Hindoos, is the  exact equivalent of Zeus Pater among the Greeks, Jupiter among the  Romans, and of \"Our Father who art in the heavens\" in the divinely  taught and holiest prayer of our own religion.    [9]How any one can think that Buddha did not believe in a Supreme Being  in the face and light of the wonderful Sutra, or sermon of which, the  text is but a condensation or abstract, is to me unaccountable.  It is  equally strange that any one should suppose he regarded Nirvana, which  is but another name for Brahma Loca, as meaning annihilation.    To be sure he used the method afterwards adopted by Socrates, and now  known as the Socratic method, of appealing to the unquestioned belief  of the Brahmans themselves as the foundation of his argument in support  of that fundamental truth of all religions, that the pure in heart  alone can see God.  But to suppose that he was using arguments to  convince them that he did not believe himself, is a libel on one whose  absolute truthfulness and sincerity admit of no question.

To return to the point, however; if such things exist among those in the  highest positions of trust it is not surprising to find wholesale  chicanery among the lower orders; that they realise their shortcomings  is evidenced by the fact that if they wish to impress you with the truth  of a statement, they add \"palabra de Ingles,\" i.e., \"on the word of an  Englishman.\"    Their Indian descent is answerable for a great deal, the white and black  blood being so mixed that it is almost impossible to note the dividing  line. Their dusky ancestors were blessed with an extremely limited  intelligence, only being able to count up to four. The following  incidents were related to me by an old estanciero. He once saw a  trainload of Indian prisoners who had had oranges given them throwing  the skins against the windows and showing great surprise when they fell  inside.    In another instance a woman came with her daughter to place her in  domestic service at the estancia, and as the mother did all the talking,  the estanciero's wife asked if the daughter could speak Spanish.    \"Oh, yes,\" answered the mother, \"but she is barefoot, and would not  presume to talk Spanish unless she had shoes on.\"    This same girl at first insisted on turning up the carpet whenever she  entered a room and walking along the boards at the side.    I fear that I have given a black character to the people I work among,  but there are lights as well as shades, and I have had many a weary  hour's ride wiled away by the philosophy and anecdotes of some peon or  small contractor, without mentioning the enjoyment of that hospitality  which is a characteristic of the nation.    Beside a camp fire, under the stars, while the mate pot passes from hand  to hand, or when huddled under a horse cloth with the rain dousing the  last embers, I have found the Correntino, or Santa Fecino, a cheery and  uncomplaining companion, who compares well with the recently arrived  Englishman, who, under the same circumstances, is generally sleepy or  bad tempered.    Treat him well and he will treat you well, but if it is necessary to  chasten him for his soul's good, keep your hand a little nearer to your  revolver than his is to his knife.    DUST AND OTHER STORMS.            DUST AND OTHER STORMS.      Life in South America has many and varied experiences, though not so  uncomfortably exciting perhaps to-day as they were, when more than three  years seldom passed without a revolution of some kind, either national  or provincial. The year 1893 was marked by two revolutions in Rosario,  the first provincial and the second national, with perhaps little more  than two months between them. It sounds terribly alarming to hear that a  revolution has broken out, and pictures of the French Revolution  immediately rise before one, but, fortunately, those of South American  cities are not of that calibre; reports and rumours fly about of the  terrible things that are going to be done, but these generally end in  rumour, and after a few persons, those who have nothing to do with the  movement, have been killed, probably by soldiers letting off their  rifles up some street just on the chance of hitting something (often  that at which they are _not_ aiming), the revolution fizzles out very  quickly.    In the second revolution of 1893 great excitement was caused in Rosario  by a revolutionary gunboat being pursued by a Government boat and a  naval battle (!) being fought on the river outside Rosario. These two  boats blazed away at each other till the revolutionary gunboat was  reduced to a wreck; the Government boat then threatened to turn its guns  on Rosario unless the revolutionists capitulated. The town was given  twenty-four hours to decide, and, after various disasters, including a  terrible battle, had been threatened, as usual the revolution came to a  sudden end, on this particular occasion owing to the revolutionist  leader, D. Alem, committing suicide. That same year, 1893,  distinguished itself by drawing to a close with three of the most  terrible dust storms ever seen in a country that, after any lengthened  period of dry weather, suffers from dust storms of a greater or lesser  degree. The first of these occurred early in December, after many months  of drought, on a brilliantly sunny afternoon. Standing at the front door  of a house at Fisherton, a suburb about six miles from Rosario, we  noticed right down in the S.W., on the horizon, great banks of  grey-looking clouds, which, to our surprise, seemed to be rolling  rapidly up the sky towards us. They had a most alarming appearance, for  these masses of grey cloud approaching so rapidly seemed to portend a  storm of terrible force. In less than twenty minutes from the time we  first saw the clouds the afternoon had changed from brilliant sunshine  to pitchy darkness. So rapidly had the darkness come on us that no one  was prepared, and no matches or lights were forthcoming; so there we  stood in a room in absolute darkness, no glimmer of light even revealing  where the windows were situated in the room. Though all doors and  windows were closely shut, we could feel the dust entering in clouds  through the cracks, making it quite unpleasant breathing. When the storm  caught us we had to stand and wait, I must own with some fear as to how  it was going to end. Up to this time the storm had come up and fallen on  us in total silence: now, after about ten minutes of pitch darkness, we  could hear in the far distance the wind coming. It came up with cyclonic  force, and then everything in the way of tins and buckets began to be  blown in every direction, and the horses to gallop about neighing,  evidently very much frightened. The wind was the forerunner of the rain,  which gradually began to clear the air, though, of course, for some time  it rained mud, much to the detriment of the houses, and to anyone  unfortunate enough to be caught out of doors in the storm; indeed, one  of our friends, who insisted on starting for the station just as the  storm descended on us, was found crouching under his umbrella by one of  the posts of the railway fence, with a face as black as a sweep's, and,  by then, deeply repentant that he had started for the station against  advice. Indeed, many caught out in camp by the storm lost their lives  through falling into wells, and, in some cases, the river. But,  fortunately, nowadays--principally, I fancy, owing to the larger area of  country under cultivation--these dust storms do not recur.          LOCUSTS.      During the past century considerable study has been centred upon the  life and habits of the locust, mainly from the desire to seek its  subjugation and destruction, and, whilst much general biological  information has been written upon the subject, there are things which we  do not yet know about this insect or its habits. We do not know what  precise influences cause their migration, nor do we know what is the  exact length of life of the locust or its breeding power, or the precise  locality in any country which may be defined as its permanent abode.  Locusts are classified under the order of orthopterous insects of the  family Acrydiidae, and are very closely related to grasshoppers.    There are a large number of species, the differentiating features being  more or less the form and sculpture of protorax, the size of the head,  the length and size of the prosternal spine, the comparative length and  size of the hind thighs and shanks, the amount and arrangement of the  tegmina mottlings, the comparative length of wings, and the general  build of the entire insect, which may be robust or fairly slender.    A general description of the distinctive physical features of migratory  locusts might be given as a strong, wild-looking head, a strong collar  inside which the neck moves, powerful and peculiarly-formed legs  attached to a short, strong, square trunk or thorax, four wings, two  antennae or feelers, six legs, and a long segmentary abdomen. The ground  colour of the locust is generally brownish, straw, or red, but its  colour varies somewhat according to the particular season of the year  or some other peculiar circumstance, but nothing certain is known as to  what influences the shade of colour. Mere ground colour is immaterial  and does not signify a new species.    Besides having a pair of compound eyes which form so noticeable a  feature in its head, there are three other simple little eyes, placed  like shining dots at three angles of a triangle below the two feelers.    The mouth, which is a fearful apparatus, consists of nine distinct and  well-marked organs; an interior or upper lip, consisting of a plate  deeply cleft and capable of opening enormously; two true jaws or  powerful mandibles; and two pairs of jointed organs called (maxillary)  palpi, and two lower jaws. The mandibles and jaws move laterally from  right to left.    The thorax or trunk consists really of three rings. To the first is  attached the two front legs; to the second, the two middle legs and the  first pair of wings, and to the third, the two hind legs and the second  pair of posterior wings. Along the posterior margin is a well marked  serrated (spinous) arrangement by means of which the locust adheres and  grips forcibly. The trunk appears to be full of a fatty sort of  substance.    The abdomen consists of a number of horny segments which are joined  together by an elastic membrane, a construction which enables the insect  to extend its body several centimetres beyond its normal extent. It can  also be increased in thickness.    The front and middle feet of this insect are short and weak, but the  length, strength, and formation of the hind legs enable it to take  extraordinary leaps. A full-grown locust can jump seven or eight feet in  height, whilst it is said to be able to leap more than 200 times the  length of its body.    The female"]]]
