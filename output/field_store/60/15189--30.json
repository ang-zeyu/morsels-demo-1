CHAPTER IV    THE MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLES IN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE      [Sidenote: Universality of these movements.]    The ethnic and political boundaries of Europe to-day are the residuum of  countless racial, national, tribal and individual movements reaching  back into an unrecorded past. The very names of Turkey, Bulgaria,  England, Scotland and France are borrowed from intruding peoples. New  England, New France, New Scotland or Nova Scotia and many more on the  American continents register the Trans-Atlantic nativity of their first  white settlers. The provinces of Galicia in Spain, Lombardy in Italy,  Brittany in France, Essex and Sussex in England record in their names  streams of humanity diverted from the great currents of the  Voelkerwanderung. The Romance group of languages, from Portugal to  Roumania, testify to the sweep of expanding Rome, just as the wide  distribution of the Aryan linguistic family points to many roads and  long migrations from some unplaced birthplace. Names like Cis-Alpine and  Trans-Alpine Gaul in the Roman Empire, Trans-Caucasia, Trans-Caspia and  Trans-Baikalia in the Russian Empire, the Transvaal and Transkei in  South Africa, indicate the direction whence the advancing people have  come.    [Sidenote: Stratification of races]    Ethnology reveals an east and west stratification of linguistic groups  in Europe, a north and south stratification of races, and another  stratification by altitude, which reappears in all parts of the world,  and shows certain invading dominant races occupying the lowlands and  other displaced ones the highlands. This definite arrangement points to  successive arrivals, a crowding forward, an intrusion of the strong into  fertile, accessible valleys and plains, and a dislodgment of the weak  into the rough but safe keeping of mountain range or barren peninsula,  where they are brought to bay. Ethnic fragments, linguistic survivals,  or merely place names, dropped like discarded baggage along the march  of a retreating army, bear witness everywhere to tragic recessionals.    [Sidenote: The name Historical Movement.]    Every country whose history we examine proves the recipient of  successive streams of humanity. Even sea-girt England has received  various intruding peoples from the Roman occupation to the recent influx  of Russian Jews. In prehistoric times it combined several elements in  its population, as the discovery of the \"long barrow\" men and \"round  barrow\" men by archaeologists, and the identification of a surviving  Iberian or Mediterranean strain by ethnologists go to prove.[126] Egypt,  Mesopotamia, and India tell the same story, whether in their recorded or  unrecorded history. Tropical Africa lacks a history; but all that has  been pieced together by ethnologists and anthropologists, in an effort  to reconstruct its past, shows incessant movement,--growth, expansion  and short-lived conquest, followed by shrinkage, expulsion or absorption  by another invader.[127] To this constant shifting of races and peoples  the name of historical movement has been given, because it underlies  most of written history, and constitutes the major part of unwritten  history, especially that of savage and nomadic tribes. Two things are  vital in the history of every people, its ethnic composition and the  wars it wages in defense or extension of its boundaries. Both rest upon  historical movements,--intrusions, whether peaceful or hostile, into its  own land, and encroachments upon neighboring territory necessitated by  growth. Back of all such movements is natural increase of population  beyond local means of subsistence, and the development of the war spirit  in the effort to secure more abundant subsistence either by raid or  conquest of territory.    [Sidenote: Evolution of the Historical Movement.]    Among primitive peoples this movement is simple and monotonous. It  involves all members of the tribe, either in pursuit of game, or  following the herd over the tribal territory, or in migrations seeking  more and better land. Among civilized peoples it assumes various forms,  and especially is differentiated for different members of the social  group. The civilized state develops specialized frontiersmen, armies,  explorers, maritime traders, colonists, and missionaries, who keep a  part of the people constantly moving and directing external expansion,  while the mass of the population converts the force once expended in the  migrant food-quest into internal activity. Here we come upon a paradox.  The nation as a whole, with the development of sedentary life, increases  its population and therewith its need for external movements; it widens  its national area and its circle of contact with other lands, enlarges  its geographical horizon, and improves its internal communication over a  growing territory; it evolves a greater mobility within and without,  which attaches, however, to certain classes of society, not to the  entire social group. This mobility becomes the outward expression of a  whole complex of economic wants, intellectual needs, and political  ambitions. It is embodied in the conquests which build up empires, in  the colonization which develops new lands, in the world-wide exchange of  commodities and ideas which lifts the level of civilization, till this  movement of peoples becomes a fundamental fact of history.    [Sidenote: Nature of primitive movements.]    This movement is and has been universal and varied. When most  unobtrusive in its operation, it has produced its greatest effects. To  seize upon a few conspicuous migrations, like the _Voelkerwanderung_ and  the irruption of the Turks into Europe, made dramatic by their relation  to the declining empires of Rome and Constantinople, and to ignore the  vast sum of lesser but more normal movements which by slow increments  produce greater and more lasting results, leads to wrong conclusions  both in ethnology and history. Here, as in geology, great effects do not  necessarily presuppose vast forces, but rather the steady operation of  small ones. It is often assumed that the world was peopled by a series  of migrations; whereas everything indicates that humanity spread over  the earth little by little, much as the imported gypsy moth is gradually  occupying New England or the water hyacinth the rivers of Florida. Louis  Agassiz observed in 1853 that \"the boundaries within which the different  natural combinations of animals are known to be circumscribed upon the  surface of the earth, coincide with the natural range of distinct types  of man.\"[128] The close parallelism between Australian race and flora,  Eskimo race and Arctic fauna, points to a similar manner of dispersion.  Wallace, in describing how the Russian frontier of settlement slowly  creeps forward along the Volga, encroaching upon the Finnish and Tartar  areas, and permeating them with Slav blood and civilization, adds that  this is probably the normal method of expansion.[129] Thucydides describes  the same process of encroachment, displacement, and migration in ancient  Hellas.[130] Strabo quotes Posidonius as saying that the emigration of the  Cimbrians and other kindred tribes from their native seats was gradual  and by no means sudden.[131] The traditions of the Delaware Indians show  their advance from their early home in central Canada southward to the  Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay to have been a slow zigzag movement,  interrupted by frequent long halts, leaving behind one laggard group  here and sending out an offshoot there, who formed new tribes and  thereby diversified the stock.[132] It was an aimless wandering, without  destination and purpose other than to find a pleasanter habitat. The  Vandals appear first as \"a loose aggregation of restless tribes who must  not be too definitely assigned to any precise district on the map,\"  somewhere in central or eastern Prussia.[133] Far-reaching migrations  aiming at a distant goal, like the Gothic and Hunnish conquests of  Italy, demand both a geographical knowledge and an organization too high  for primitive peoples, and therefore belong to a later period of  development.[134]    [Sidenote: Number and range.]    The long list of recorded migrations has been supplemented by the  researches of ethnologists, which have revealed a multitude of  prehistoric movements. These are disclosed in greater number and range"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#20)"],[1,"encouraging word of praise soon put him in love for the  time being with those whom he had lately cursed.    He never shrank from disobeying the instructions of whatever authority  was over him if his judgment led him to the conclusion that he would  serve his country better by disobedience and by following his own  judgment; whenever he was driven to do this he was right and those  above him were wrong, and in each case he was so conclusively right  that no authoritative power dare court-martial him, or even censure  his conduct, since the public believed more in him than in them. When  the spirit of well-balanced defiance was upon him, he seemed to say to  the public, to himself, and to those who were responsible for his  instructions, \"Do you imagine yourselves more capable of judging the  circumstances, and the immeasurable difficulties surrounding them,  than I am, whose business it has been to watch minutely every changing  phase? Or do you think my love of country or glory so incomparably  inferior to yours that I would risk any harm coming to it, or to  myself and the men under me, if I was not sure of my ground? For what  other reason do you think I disobeyed orders? Do you suppose I did it  in order that some disaster should be the result? Or do you still  think that your plan, right or wrong, should have been carried out,  even though it would be accompanied with appalling consequences to  life and property? If these are your views, I wish to remind you that  I am the Indomitable Nelson, who will stand no damned nonsense from  you or from the enemy when I see that my country, or the interests  that I represent, are going to be jeopardized by your self-assertive  instructions, and I wish to intimate to you that there is only one way  of dealing with a Frenchman, and that is to knock him down when he is  an enemy. You have obviously got to learn that to be civil to a  Frenchman is to be laughed at, and this I shall never submit to.\" The  Admiralty censured Nelson for disobeying Lord Keith's orders and, as  they claimed, endangering Minorca, and also for landing seamen for the  siege of Capua, and told him \"not to employ the seamen in any such way  in future.\" The Admiralty were too hasty in chastising him. He claimed  that his success in freeing the whole kingdom of Naples from the  French was almost wholly due to the employment of British sailors,  whose valour carried the day.    Nelson sent the First Lord a slap between the eyes in his best  sarcastic form. He said briefly, \"I cannot enter into all the detail  in explanation of my motives which led me to take the action I did, as  I have only a left hand, but I may inform you that my object is to  drive the French to the devil, and restore peace and happiness to  mankind\"; and he continues, \"I feel I am fitter to do the action than  to describe it.\" And then he curtly and in so many words says to his  Chief, \"Don't you be troubled about Minorca. I have secured the main  thing against your wish and that of Lord Keith, and you may be assured  that I shall see that no harm comes to the Islands, which seems to be  a cause of unnecessary anxiety to you.\" Incidentally, the expulsion of  the French from Naples and seating Ferdinand on the throne was, as I  have previously stated, not an unqualified success, nor was he  accurate in his statement that he had restored happiness to millions.  The success was a mere shadow. He had emancipated a set of villains.  Troubridge says they were all thieves and vagabonds, robbing their  unfortunate countrymen, selling confiscated property for nothing,  cheating the King and Treasury by pocketing everything that their  sticky fingers touched, and that their villainies were so deeply  rooted that if some steps were not taken to dig them out, the  Government could not hold together. Out of twenty millions of ducats  collected as revenue, only thirteen millions reached the Treasury, and  the King had to pay four ducats instead of one. Troubridge again  intimates to his superior that Ferdinand is surrounded with a nest of  the most unscrupulous thieves that could be found in all Europe. \"Such  damned cowards and villains,\" he declared, \"he had never seen or heard  of before.\"      IX    The French did not mince matters when their opportunity came. They,  too, regarded them as vermin, and treated them according to the  unrestrained edicts of the Reign of Terror, organized and  administered by their late compatriots Sardanapalus, Danton,  Maximilian Robespierre, and their literary colleague, the execrable  Marat, who, by the way, was expeditiously dispatched by the gallant  Charlotte Corday.[12]    This method of bestowing the blessings of Liberty, Equality, and  Fraternity was received by the Neapolitans with a frenzy from which  there sprang a demoniac retaliation. Societies were formed to carry  out the most atrocious crimes against the Neapolitan revolutionists,  whom the Royalists hated more than they did the French. The fishermen  and other miscreants came to a solemn conclusion that it was clearly  their duty as a Christian people to combine, and each choose one whom  they should privately guillotine when the opportunity offered. With  the idea of paying a high compliment to Troubridge, who had so  splendidly protected the Royalists, fought the French, and subdued  the revolutionists, they made him the recipient of a decapitated head  which had proudly sat on the shoulders of a revolutionist. This trophy  was actually sent to him with his basket of breakfast grapes. In  making the present the gallant fisherman conveyed his compliments to  the Admiral, and reminded him that it was a token of his high  appreciation of the Admiral's brilliant services to the Royalist  cause.    The Court was infested with traitors who would first carry out their  vengeance against their rebellious compatriots and then cunningly lay  the blame on those under whose protection they were. One of their  judges informed Troubridge that he must have a Bishop to excommunicate  some of the traitor priests before he could have them executed, and  the fine sailor, who was sick of the crafty devils and the task he had  been allocated to carry out, replied, \"For the love of God hang the  damned rascals first, and then let the Bishop deal with them if he did  not think hanging was a sufficient degradation.\" Nothing in the annals  of history can surpass the effrontery of these intriguers, which  throws a lurid light on the class of administrators who associated  with the British nation and spilt the blood of the flower of our land  in bolstering up a government that was a disgrace and put all human  perfidy in the shade.    These allies of ours, who were joyously butchering and robbing each  other, demanded a British warship to take the priests to Palermo, so  that they might be degraded in a proper, Christian fashion and then  brought to Naples for execution. Troubridge was audaciously requested  to appoint a hangman (it may be he was asked to combine this with his  other naval duties), and knowing the fine sense of noble dignity in  the average sailor, we can easily imagine the flow of adjectives that  accompanied the refusal, and how he would relate the outrage to which  he had been subjected in quarterdeck language, that need not be here  repeated, to his superior officer, Admiral Nelson, who must have felt  the degradation of being selected to carry out as dirty a piece of  work as ever devolved upon a public servant. To fight for his King and  country was the joy of his soul, but to be selected as wet-nurse to  the kingdom of Naples and the dignitaries that were at the head of it  would have been an unbearable insult to his sense of proportion had it  not been for the fulsome flattery, to which he was so susceptible,  which was adroitly administered by the ladies of the Court, headed by  the Queen and supplemented by the wife of Sir William Hamilton.    There is always some fatal weakness about a great man that lures him  into littleness, and this was an overwhelming tragedy in Nelson's  career. The approbation of men was gratefully received and even asked  for, but the adoration of women reduced him to helplessness. He was  drugged by it, and the stronger the doses, the more efficacious they  were. They nullified the vision of the unwholesome task he was set to  carry out until his whole being revolted against the indignity of it,  when he would pour out his wrath to Lady Hamilton as he did at the  time when Troubridge would report to him his own trials. No doubt this  caused him to realize the chaotic condition of public affairs, for he  writes to the lady that \"politics are hateful to him, and that  Ministers of Kings are the greatest scoundrels that ever lived.\" The  King of Naples is, he suspects, to be superseded by a prince who has  married a Russian Archduchess. This, presumably, had been arranged by  the \"great political scoundrels.\" He stands loyally by Ferdinand, but  soon all the work of that part of his life that gave him socially so  much pleasure and professionally so much misery is to be left for  evermore, and his great talents used in other and higher spheres.    He had retaken Naples from the French, who had set up the Parthenopean  Republic in 1799, and placed the tyrant King on his throne again;  after a few more chequered years a treaty of neutrality was signed  between France and Naples, which was treacherously broken by Naples.  Ferdinand had to fly to Sicily, the French troops entered the capital,  and Bonaparte, who had been marching from one victory to another,  cleared out deep-rooted abuses and introduced reforms wherever he  could. He had become the terror and the enemy of the misgoverning  monarchs of that period, and the French nation had proclaimed him  Emperor in 1804. He placed his brother Joseph on the throne of Naples  in February 1806; Joseph ruled with marked moderation and  distinction, sweeping"]]]
