[Illustration: Spion Kop and Vaal Krantz positions. _Stanford's Geog'l:  Estab't._]    Buller divided his force into two unequal portions. Warren with the  stronger portion was to attack the Boer right which Buller believed to  be weak, while Lyttelton with the remainder demonstrated at Potgieter's  Drift. To himself Buller reserved the part of the Chorus in a Greek  play, taking a general interest in the action, yet not personally  concerned in it; and in that capacity he issued a stirring appeal to the  relieving force.    On January 15 \"secret instructions\" were given to Warren. He was  recommended, after crossing the Tugela at Trickhardt's Drift, to proceed  west of Spion Kop, and to pivot his right and swing round on to the open  plain in rear of the Boer position facing Potgieter's Drift.    Warren, who was not of opinion that the Boer right was weak, marched out  of Springfield on the evening of January 16. Lyttelton had already  started, and during the night occupied a position on the north side of  the river near Potgieter's Drift.    The task before Warren was hard. In order to carry out Buller's plan he  must cross an unbridged river and struggle through a country of which  little was known. Next day two bridges were thrown over the Tugela above  Trickhardt's Drift, which recent rains had made dangerous, and Hart's  and Woodgate's Brigades were transferred to the left bank to cover the  crossing: but it was not until sunset on January 18 that the entire  force with its tedious transport was established on the north side of  the river.    The mounted troops under Dundonald were sent out at mid-day to  reconnoitre towards the N.W. and in the course of the afternoon his  advanced squadrons came upon a Boer commando which was easily dealt  with, but before the issue was decided, he had reported that he was  engaged near Acton Holmes, and asked for help. Warren assumed that the  mounted troops, which he had sent out to reconnoitre, had wilfully and  prematurely forced on an action, and were now in trouble; and it was not  until the next morning, after an infantry brigade had been moved out to  support them, that Warren heard from Dundonald, whose previous messages  had not clearly described the situation, that he was able to take care  of himself. Dundonald had at first expected that the main body would  follow him, and his reports seem to show that he had hoped to induce  Warren to move towards Acton Holmes. He was rebuked for assuming, not  unnaturally, that the objective of the operations was Ladysmith, and  instructed that the objective was a junction with the other portion of  Buller's force. He was summoned to Warren's headquarters and ordered to  abstain from further attempts to ride round the enemy's right. Thus, as  before at Hlangwhane, a promising cavalry movement by Dundonald was  thrown away.    The deliberate march of the British Army from Frere and the delay at the  Drifts gave the Boers ample time to prepare for the attack. On January  19, on which day Warren moved to Venter's Spruit three miles from  Trickhardt's Drift, they were in occupation of the whole line from  Vaalkrantz to the Rangeworthy Heights. Fourie was in command of the  left, Schalk Burger of the centre, which included the important features  of Green Hill, Spion Kop, and the Twin Peaks; and L. Botha of the right,  in which was Bastion Hill.    There were two roads by which Warren could advance; one running by  Fairview northwards from Trickhardt's Drift between Green Hill and Three  Tree Hill, and the other eight miles longer by Acton Holmes. The length  of the latter and a report from White that several commandos were on  their way to Acton Holmes from Ladysmith, led Warren to adopt the former  route.    He informed Buller of his decision, adding that certain \"special  arrangements\" which he had made would oblige him to remain near  Trickhardt's Drift, and that he must therefore have further supplies.  The \"special arrangements\" were in fact the steps which every general  would take before attacking a strong position not immediately  accessible; namely to acquire ground from which it could be threatened  and shelled. Clery was ordered to direct the operation, which Warren  believed would entail \"comparatively little loss of life.\"    Early on January 20 Clery with one brigade and artillery advanced up the  re-entrant which springs from the river towards the east end of the  Rangeworthy Heights, and posted his guns half way up the valley on Three  Tree Hill. Hart, with a brigade of five battalions, was sent to occupy  the irregular southern crest of the heights running from Three Tree Hill  towards Bastion Hill. He drove the Boers out of their advanced trenches,  but found that the northern and higher crest to which they had retired,  could only be won by a frontal advance across open ground. He and his  brave Irishmen were as ready as ever to push on in the line of the  greatest resistance, but he was ordered by Clery to forbear. Meanwhile  Dundonald, not deterred by the damping of his trek on the 18th, and  while obeying an order from Warren to come to heel, seized Bastion Hill,  thereby securing Hart's left flank on the crest. So far as they went,  the operations of January 20 were successful. Warren's pivot movement  was in train, the whole of his force was now threatening the Boer right  which was widely extended but deficient in depth; and the day's  casualties were few. Following the example of Buller, who delegated his  authority to Warren, the latter entrusted the conduct of the day's  operations to Clery, who in succession ordered the chief movement to be  carried out by Hart. Next day the mounted troops on Bastion Hill were  relieved by infantry.    Buller was aware that the Ladysmith garrison, weakened by sickness and  privation, could give him little or no help; but at least during the  earlier phase of the Trickhardt's Drift operations he was confident. On  January 17 he told White that \"somehow he thought he was going to be  successful this time,\" and that he hoped to be within touch of Ladysmith  in six days. His Head Quarters were at Spearman's Camp, a few miles  south of Mount Alice, whence he rode over daily to note and criticize  the tactics.    It now occurred to Warren that he might have been mistaken as to the  significance of the position occupied by the enemy on the Rangeworthy  Heights, and that it might be in reality a screen to hide a trek of the  Free Staters back to their own country; and on this supposition, which  was founded upon reports that the Siege of Ladysmith had been raised and  that some wagons had been seen on trek westwards towards the Drakensberg  passes, he applied for reinforcements to enable him to block the way.    Buller sent him Talbot Coke's brigade with some howitzers; and came over  to consult with him on January 22. The situation was not satisfactory.  Time was being wasted, Warren's \"special arrangements\" had done little,  and now he had a new idea. Buller still advocated an attack on the  enemy's right, while Warren wished to persevere with his advance by the  Fairview Road; but he pointed out that Spion Kop, which his reading of  the \"secret instructions\" had led him to regard as out of bounds, must  first be taken. No definite action seems to have been decided on, and  Warren was left to act within certain limits on his own responsibility.  Finally, with the approval of the four infantry generals, he resolved to  seize Spion Kop that night. The attack, however, was postponed until the  following night, to give time for the position to be reconnoitred.    Spion Kop is a ridge of which the chief features are a pair of high  peaks joined by a nek to a plateau, from which a spur, ending in a kopje  called Conical Hill, juts out at right angles to the nek, which becomes  a spur of the plateau at a Little Knoll east of the summit. Its tactical  importance was derived from its height, as the summit, though not the  peaks, is higher than any of the ground held by the enemy; and from its  position, as it was on the obtuse angle formed by the meeting of Botha's  line on the Boer right with Schalk Burger's on the centre, and enfiladed  each of them. It was accessible from the British front by a slope which  rises from the lower ground to another spur running S.W. from the  plateau.    On the morning of January 23, Buller saw Warren, and again pressed him  to make an attack on the Boer right; but finding that the orders for the  assault on Spion Kop had already been issued, he refrained from vetoing  it. He threatened, however, that if immediate action in some direction  were not taken, Warren's force would be withdrawn to the south of the  Tugela.    On the previous day Warren, betraying the Engineer officer unused to  handling large bodies of men, and unfamiliar with the military unities,  rearranged his command with a straight edge, and distributed it in one  way for tactical, and in another for administrative purposes. All the  troops lying west of an imaginary line became the left attack under  Clery, while those east of it became the right attack. The latter, under  Talbot Coke, were ordered to seize the Spion Kop position by night, and  entrench it before daybreak, the actual assault being made by Woodgate  with two battalions, some mounted infantry on foot, and a few Engineers.  At sunset on January 23, the curtain fell upon the first act of the  Tragedy of Spion Kop.    On the night of the January 23 Spion Kop was held as an observation post  by a party of seventy burghers. When Buller first appeared at  Potgieter's Drift, it was on the right of the Boer line, but now it was  only the right of the centre under Schalk Burger. Little was known of  its features and tactical value,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#20)"],[1,"                                                    12th Jan.    Dear Mr. Philanthropist,    Your cheque for my family came yesterday.  Thank you so much!  I cut  gymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon, and you should  have seen the girl's face!  She was so surprised and happy and relieved  that she looked almost young; and she's only twenty-four. Isn't it  pitiful?    Anyway, she feels now as though all the good things were coming  together.  She has steady work ahead for two months--someone's getting  married, and there's a trousseau to make.    'Thank the good Lord!' cried the mother, when she grasped the fact that  that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars.    'It wasn't the good Lord at all,' said I, 'it was Daddy-Long-Legs.'  (Mr. Smith, I called you.)    'But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,' said she.    'Not at all!  I put it in his mind myself,' said I.    But anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward you suitably.  You  deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory.                       Yours most gratefully,                                             Judy Abbott                                                             15th Feb.    May it please Your Most Excellent Majesty:    This morning I did eat my breakfast upon a cold turkey pie and a goose,  and I did send for a cup of tee (a china drink) of which I had never  drank before.    Don't be nervous, Daddy--I haven't lost my mind; I'm merely quoting  Sam'l Pepys.  We're reading him in connection with English History,  original sources.  Sallie and Julia and I converse now in the language  of 1660.  Listen to this:    'I went to Charing Cross to see Major Harrison hanged, drawn and  quartered:  he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that  condition.'  And this:  'Dined with my lady who is in handsome mourning  for her brother who died yesterday of spotted fever.'    Seems a little early to commence entertaining, doesn't it?  A friend of  Pepys devised a very cunning manner whereby the king might pay his  debts out of the sale to poor people of old decayed provisions.  What  do you, a reformer, think of that?  I don't believe we're so bad today  as the newspapers make out.    Samuel was as excited about his clothes as any girl; he spent five  times as much on dress as his wife--that appears to have been the  Golden Age of husbands.  Isn't this a touching entry?  You see he  really was honest.  'Today came home my fine Camlett cloak with gold  buttons, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to  pay for it.'    Excuse me for being so full of Pepys; I'm writing a special topic on  him.    What do you think, Daddy?  The Self-Government Association has  abolished the ten o'clock rule.  We can keep our lights all night if we  choose, the only requirement being that we do not disturb others--we  are not supposed to entertain on a large scale.  The result is a  beautiful commentary on human nature.  Now that we may stay up as long  as we choose, we no longer choose.  Our heads begin to nod at nine  o'clock, and by nine-thirty the pen drops from our nerveless grasp.  It's nine-thirty now.  Good night.                                                         Sunday    Just back from church--preacher from Georgia.  We must take care, he  says, not to develop our intellects at the expense of our emotional  natures--but methought it was a poor, dry sermon (Pepys again). It  doesn't matter what part of the United States or Canada they come from,  or what denomination they are, we always get the same sermon.  Why on  earth don't they go to men's colleges and urge the students not to  allow their manly natures to be crushed out by too much mental  application?    It's a beautiful day--frozen and icy and clear.  As soon as dinner is  over, Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt (friends of  mine, but you don't know them) and I are going to put on short skirts  and walk 'cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried chicken  and waffle supper, and then have Mr. Crystal Spring drive us home in  his buckboard.  We are supposed to be inside the campus at seven, but  we are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight.    Farewell, kind Sir.           I have the honour of subscribing myself,             Your most loyall, dutifull, faithfull and obedient servant,                                             J. Abbott                                                             March Fifth    Dear Mr. Trustee,    Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month--a weary day for the John  Grier Home.  How relieved they'll be when five o'clock comes and you  pat them on the head and take yourselves off!  Did you (individually)  ever pat me on the head, Daddy?  I don't believe so--my memory seems to  be concerned only with fat Trustees.    Give the Home my love, please--my TRULY love.  I have quite a feeling  of tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years.  When  I first came to college I felt quite resentful because I'd been robbed  of the normal kind of childhood that the other girls had had; but now,  I don't feel that way in the least.  I regard it as a very unusual  adventure.  It gives me a sort of vantage point from which to stand  aside and look at life.  Emerging full grown, I get a perspective on  the world, that other people who have been brought up in the thick of  things entirely lack.    I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are  happy.  They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses are  deadened to it; but as for me--I am perfectly sure every moment of my  life that I am happy.  And I'm going to keep on being, no matter what  unpleasant things turn up.  I'm going to regard them (even toothaches)  as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like.  'Whatever sky's above me, I've a heart for any fate.'    However, Daddy, don't take this new affection for the J.G.H.  too  literally.  If I have five children, like Rousseau, I shan't leave them  on the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure their being  brought up simply.    Give my kindest regards to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful;  love would be a little strong) and don't forget to tell her what a  beautiful nature I've developed.                                   Affectionately,                                                     Judy                                                      LOCK WILLOW,                                                    4th April    Dear Daddy,    Do you observe the postmark?  Sallie and I are embellishing Lock Willow  with our presence during the Easter Vacation.  We decided that the best  thing we could do with our ten days was to come where it is quiet.  Our  nerves had got to the point where they wouldn't stand another meal in  Fergussen.  Dining in a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when  you are tired.  There is so much noise that you can't hear the girls  across the table speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone  and shout.  That is the truth.    We are tramping over the hills and reading and writing, and having a  nice, restful time.  We climbed to the top of 'Sky Hill' this morning  where Master Jervie and I once cooked supper--it doesn't seem possible  that it was nearly two years ago.  I could still see the place where  the smoke of our fire blackened the rock.  It is funny how certain  places get connected with certain people, and you never go back without  thinking of them.  I was quite lonely without him--for two minutes.    What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy?  You will begin to  believe that I am incorrigible--I am writing a book.  I started it  three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks.  I've caught the secret.  Master Jervie and that editor man were right; you are most convincing  when you write about the things you know.  And this time it is about  something that I do know--exhaustively.  Guess where it's laid?  In the  John Grier Home!  And it's good, Daddy, I actually believe it is--just  about the tiny little things that happened every day.  I'm a realist  now.  I've abandoned romanticism; I shall go back to it later though,  when my own adventurous future begins.    This new book is going to get itself finished--and published!  You see  if it doesn't. If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying,  you do get it in the end.  I've been trying for four years to get a  letter from you--and I haven't given up hope yet.    Goodbye, Daddy dear,    (I like to call you Daddy dear; it's so alliterative.)                                       Affectionately,                                                     Judy      PS.  I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it's very distressing.  Skip this postscript if you don't want your sensibilities all wrought  up.    Poor old Grove is dead.  He got so that he couldn't chew and they had  to shoot him.    Nine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week.    One of the cows is sick, and we had to have the veterinary surgeon out  from Bonnyrigg Four Corners.  Amasai stayed up all night to give her  linseed oil and whisky.  But we have an awful suspicion that the poor  sick cow got nothing but linseed oil.    Sentimental Tommy (the tortoise-shell cat) has disappeared; we are  afraid he has been caught in a trap.    There are lots of troubles in the world!                                                             17th May    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    This is going to be extremely short because my shoulder aches at the  sight of a pen.  Lecture notes all day, immortal novel all evening,  make too much writing.    Commencement three weeks from next Wednesday.  I think you might come  and make my acquaintance--I shall hate you if you don't! Julia's  inviting Master Jervie, he being her family, and Sallie's inviting  Jimmie McB., he being her family, but who is there for me to invite?"]]]
