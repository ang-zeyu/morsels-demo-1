Suppose women would not live in houses, or wear jewels and      gowns, that are bought for them out of wicked millions made upon      the stock exchange?        Suppose they would stop decorating their dwellings to an agony,      crowding them hurriedly with this and that of the last and newest,      just because it is last and new, making a show and rivalry of      what is not a true-grown beauty of a home at all, but a mere      meretriciousness; suppose they would so set to work and change      society that displays and feastings, which use up at every      separate one a year's comfortable support for a quiet, modest      family, should be given up as vulgarities; that people should care      for, and be ready for, a true interchange of life and thought, and      simple, uncrowded opportunities for these; suppose women would      say, \"No; I will not blaze at Newport, or run through Europe      dropping American eagles or English sovereigns after me like the      trail of a comet, or the crumbs that Hop-'o-my-thumb let fall from      his pocket that the people at home might track the way he had      gone; because if I have money, there is better work to be done      with it; and I will not have the money that is made by gambling      manipulations and cheats.\"        Do you think this would have no influence? More than that, and      further back, and lowlier down, suppose they should say, every      one, \"I will not have the new, convenient house, the fresh      carpetings, the pretty curtains, or even the least, most fitting      freshness, until I know the means are earned for me with honest      service to the world, and by no lucky turn of even a small      speculation.\" Further back yet, suppose them to declare, \"I will      not have the home at all, nor my own happiness, unless it can be      based and builded on the kind of life-work that helps to make a      real prosperity; that really goes to the building and safe-keeping      of a whole nation of such homes.\" Would there be no power in      that? Would it not be a kind of woman-suffrage to settle the very      initials of all that ever bears upon the public question? And to      bring that sort of woman on the stage, and to the front, is there      not enough work to do, and enough \"higher education\" to insist on      and secure?        After all, men work for women; or, if they think they do not, it      would leave them but sorry satisfaction to abandon them to such      existence as they could arrange without us. In blessed homes, or      in scattered dissipations of show, amusement, or the worse which      these shows and amusements are but terribly akin to, women give      purpose to and direct the results of all men's work. If the false      standards of living first urge them, until at length the horrible      intoxication of the game itself drives them on further and deeper,      are we less responsible for the last state of those men than for      the first?        Do you say, if good women refused these things and tried for a      simpler and truer living, there are plenty of bad ones who would      take them anyhow, and supply the motive to deeper and more      unmitigated evil? Ah, there come both answer and errand again.      Raise the fallen--at least save the growing womanhood--stop the      destruction that rushes accelerating on, before you challenge new      difficulty and danger with an indiscriminate franchise. Are not      these bad women the very \"plenty\" that would out-balance you at      the polls, if you persist in trying the \"patch-and-plaster\" remedy      of suffrage and legislation?        Recognize the fact, the law, that your power, your high      commission, is inward--vital--formative, and casual. Bring all      questions of choice or duty to this test, will it work at the      heart of things, among the realities and forces? Try your own life      by this; remember that mere external is falsehood and death. The      letter killeth. Give up all that is only of the appearance--or      even chiefly so, in conscious delight and motive--in person,      surrounding pursuit. Let your self-presentation, your home-making      and adorning, your social effort and interest, your occupation      and use of talent, all shape and issue for the things that are      essentially and integrally good, and that the world needs to have      prevail. Until you can do this, and induce such doing, it is of      little use to clamor for mere outward right, or to contend that it      would be rightly applied.        Work as you will, and widely as you can, for schools, in      associations, in everything whose end is to teach, enlighten,      enlarge women, and so the world. Help and protect the industries      of women; but keep those industries within the guiding law of      woman-life. Do not throw down barriers that take down safeguards      with them; that make threatening breaches in the very social      structure. If women must serve in shops, demand and care for it      that it shall be in a less mixed, a more shielded way than now.      The great caravansaries of trade are perilous by their throng,      publicity, and weariness. There used to be women's shops; choice      places, where a woman's care and taste had ruled before the      counters were spread; where women could quietly purchase things      that were sure to be beautiful or of good service; there were not      the tumult and ransacking that kill both shop-girl and shopper      now.        This is one instance, and but one, of the rescuing that ought      to be attempted. There ought at least to be distinct women's      departments, presided over by women of good, motherly tone and      character, in the places of business which women so frequent, and      where the thoughtful are aware of much that makes them tremble.      And surely a great many of the girls and women who choose      shop-work, because they like its excitement, ought rather to be in      homes, rendering womanly service, and preparing to serve in homes      of their own--leaving their present places to young men who might      perhaps begin so to earn the homes to offer them. Will not this      apply all the way up, into the arts and the professions even?      There must needs be exceptional women perhaps; there are, and will      be, time and errand and place for them; but Heaven forbid that      they should all become exceptional.        Once more, work for these things that are behind, and underlie;      believing that woman's place is behind and within, not of      repression, but of power; and that if she do not fill this place      it will be empty; there will be no main spring. Meanwhile she will      get her rights as she rises to them, and her defenses where she      needs them; everything that helps, defends, uplifts the woman      uplifts man and the whole fabric, and man has begun to find it      out. If he \"will give the suffrage if women want it,\" as is said,      why shall he not as well give them the things that they want      suffrage for and that they are capable of representing? Believe      me, this work, and the representation which grows out of it,      can no longer be done if we attempt the handling of political      machinery--the making of platforms, the judging of candidates, the      measuring and disputation of party plans and issues, and all the      tortuous following up of public and personal political history.        Do you say, men have their individual work in the world, and all      this beside and of it, and that therefore we may? Exactly here      comes in again the law of the interior. Their work is \"of      it\"--falls in the way. They rub against it as they go along. Men      meet each other in the business thoroughfares, at the offices and      the street corners; we are in the dear depths of home. We are with      the little ones, of whom is not this kingdom, but the kingdom of      heaven, which we, through them, may help to come. This is just      where we must abandon our work, if we attempt the doing of theirs.      And here is where our prestige will desert us, whenever great      cause calls us to speak from out our seclusions, and show men,      from our insights and our place, the occasion and desire that look      unto their rule. They will not listen then; they will remand us to      the ballot-box.        \"Inside politics\" is a good word. That is just where woman ought      to be, as she ought to be inside everything, insisting upon and      implanting the truth and right that are to conquer. And she can      not be inside and outside both. She can not do the mothering      and the home-making, the watching and ministry, the earning and      maintaining hold and privilege and motive influence behind and      through the acts of men--and all the world-wide execution of act      beside. Therefore, we say, do not give up the substance which you      might seize, for the shadow which you could not hold fast if you      were to seem to grasp it. Work on at the foundations. Insist on      truth and right; put them into all your own life, taking all the      beam out of your own eye before demanding--well, we will say the      mote, for generosity's sake, and for the holy authority of the      word--out of the brother's eyes.        Establish pure, honest, lovely things--things of good report--in      the nurseries, the schools, the social circles where you reign,      and the outside world and issue will take form and heed for      themselves. The nation, of which the family is the root, will be      made, and built, and saved accordingly. Every seed hath its own      body. The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent-head of      evil, and shall rise triumphant to become the ennobled,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#20)"],[1,"in' dat it'll break his wrist. Yer can do it de  first crack arter I shows yer how, but it'll cost twenty-five plunks ter  learn der trick.\"    After a few moments of hesitation Browning drew forth his pocketbook and  counted out twenty-five dollars.          CHAPTER XVI.    TO BREAK AN ENEMY'S WRIST.      Buster Kelley was a character. Professor Kelley he called himself. He  claimed to be a great pugilist, and he was forever telling of the men he  had put to sleep. But he couldn't produce the papers to show for it. The  public had to take his word, if they took anything.    In fact, he had never fought a battle in his life, unless it was with a  boy half his size. He made a bluff, and it went. The youngsters who came  to Yale and desired to be instructed in the manly art were always  recommended to Kelley.    To give Kelley his due, he was really a fairly good boxer, and he might  have made a decent sort of a fight if he had possessed the courage to  accept a match and the self denial and energy to go through a regular  course of training.    But Kelley was making an easy living \"catching suckers,\" and there was  no real reason why he should go through the hardships of training and  actually fighting so long as he could fool the youngsters who regarded  him as a one-time great and shining light of the prize ring.    He was too shrewd to stand up with any pupil who might get the best of  him and permit that pupil to hammer away at him. He kept them at work on  certain kinds of blows, so he always knew exactly what was coming. In  this manner of training them he never betrayed just how much he really  knew about fighting.    Some of the young fellows who became Kelley's pupils were the sons of  wealthy parents, and then it happened that the professor worked his  little game for all there was in it. He sold them \"secrets,\" and they  paid dearly for what they learned. Some of the secrets were of no value  at all, and some were actually worth knowing.    It happened that he did know how to break a man's wrist in a very simple  manner, providing he could find just the right opportunity. It was a  simple trick, but the opportunity to practice it could seldom be found  in a fight.    Kelley's eyes, which were somewhat bleary, bulged with greed as he saw  Browning count out the money.    \"It's givin' yer der trick dirt cheap--see?\" said the professor. \"I  never sold it less dan twice dat ermount before. Dat's straight. I'll  have ter make yer promise not ter tell it ter der odder chaps before I  instructs yer.\"    \"If I buy it it is mine,\" said Bruce.    \"Come off der roof! You enters inter an' agreement wid me dat yer don't  blow dis t'ing, ur I don't tell yer.\"    \"What if I want to tell a particular friend?\"    \"Yer don't tell him. Dat's all. I had ter pay t'ree hunderd dollars ter  learn dis, an' sign a 'greement dat I wouldn't give it erway. Jem Mace  tort me dis trick w'en I sparred wid him in Liverpool. He says ter me,  says he: 'Buster, ye're a boid, dat's wot ye are. If you knowed der  trick of breakin' a bloke's wrist dere ain't no duffer in der woild dat  can do yer. I'll show yer der crack fer sixty pound.' He wouldn't come  down a little bit, an' I paid him wot he asked. Since dat time I've  knocked roun' all over der woild, an' it's saved me life fife times. Dat  was a cheap trick wot I got from old Jem, dat were. A dago pulled a  knife on me oncet fer ter cut me wide open, but I broke der dago's wrist  quicker dan yer can spit.\"    \"Well, here is your money, and now I want to know that trick.\"    \"Yer 'grees not ter tell it ter anybody?\"    \"Yes, I agree.\"    \"Dat settles it.\"    Kelley took the money and carefully stowed it away in his clothes.    \"Strip up an' git inter yer trainin' rig,\" he directed.    Bruce went into the back room, and Buster poked himself in the ribs  with his thumb, grinning and winking at his own reflection in the  cracked mirror.    \"Oh, say! but I'm a peach!\" he told himself in a confidential whisper.  \"If der college perfessers don't git arter me ergin I'll make me  forchune right yere.\"    Kelley had originally hung out a sign and advertised to instruct young  gentlemen in boxing, but the faculty had made it rather warm for him,  and it was generally supposed that he had been forced to leave New  Haven. He had not left, but he had changed his quarters to the rooms he  now occupied, one flight up at the back of a saloon.    In a short time Bruce called that he was ready, and the professor  leisurely strolled into the back room, where there was a punching bag, a  striking machine, all kinds of boxing gloves, and other paraphernalia  such as a man in Kelley's business might need.    At one side of the room were several small closets, in which Kelley's  pupils kept their training suits while they were not wearing them. The  door of one closet was open, and Browning's street clothes were hanging  on some hooks inside.    Browning had got into trunks, stockings, and light, soft-bottomed shoes.  He was stripped to the waist.    Buster walked around the lad, inspecting him with a critical eye,  punching here and there with his fingers, feeling of certain muscles  and some points where there seemed to be a superabundance of flesh.    \"Well, say!\" cried the professor. \"I'd like ter know wot yer kickin'  erbout! I never seen a feller work off fat no faster dan wot youse has,  an' dat's on der dead. Why, w'en yer comes yere yer didn't have a muscle  dat weren't buried in fat, an' now dey're comin' out hard all over yer.  You'd kick ef yer wuz playin' football!\"    \"That's all right,\" said Bruce, rather impatiently. \"I know what I want,  and I am paying you to give it to me. Go ahead.\"    \"Don't be so touchy,\" scowled Kelley. \"Tackle der bag a while, an' let's  see how yer work.\"    Browning went at the punching bag while the professor stood by and  called the changes. He thumped it up against the ceiling and caught it  on the rebound thirty times in succession, first with his right and then  with his left. Then he went at it with both hands and fairly made it  hum. Then, at the word, with remarkable swiftness, he gave it fist and  elbow, first right and then left. Then he did some fancy work at a  combination hit and butt.    By the time Buster called him off Browning was streaming with  perspiration and breathing heavily.    \"Dat's first rate,\" complimented the professor. \"Yer does dat like yer  wuz a perfessional.\"    \"Great Scott!\" gasped Bruce. \"I'd never torture myself in this way if I  didn't have to! It is awful!\"    He looked around for a chair, but Buster grinned and said:    \"Dat's right, set right down--nit. Youse don't do dat no more in dis  joint. Wen I gits yer yere, yer works till yer t'rough--see? Dat's der  way ter pull der meat off er man.\"    \"Well, what's next?\"    \"See if yer can raise yer record anoder pound on der striker.\"    Bruce went at the striking machine, which registered the exact number of  pounds of force in each blow it received.    \"Has any one beaten me yet?\" he asked.    \"Naw. Dere ain't nobody come within ninety pound of yer.\"    Bruce looked satisfied, but he made up his mind to raise his record if  possible, and he succeeded in adding twelve pounds to it.    \"Say!\" exclaimed Buster, \"if dat cove wot yer arter does you he's a  boid!\"    \"That's just what he is,\" nodded Bruce, streaming with perspiration. \"He  is a bad man to go against.\"    \"If yer ever gits at him wid dat left ye'll knock him out, sure.\"    \"He is like a panther on his feet, and I shall be in great luck if I  find him with my left.\"    \"Yer don't want ter t'ink dat. Yer wants ter t'ink yer goin' ter find  him anyhow. Dat's der way.\"    \"I have thought so before, and I have discovered that he is a  wonderfully hard man to find.\"    \"Wen yer goin' ter fight him?\"    \"I am going to try to make him meet me one week from to-day.\"    \"Where?\"    \"I don't know yet.\"    \"Is he a squealer?\"    \"I don't believe you could drag anything out of him with horses.\"    \"If dat's right yer might make it yere, an' it could be kept quiet. I'd  charge a little somet'ing fer der use of der room, but dat wouldn't come  out of eder of youse, fer we'd make der fellers pay wot come in ter see  it.\"    \"We'll see about that,\" said Bruce. \"But now I want to know that trick.\"    \"Oh, yes. I near fergot dat.\"    \"Well, I didn't.\"    \"Say, if yer use dat on him I don't t'ink we can have der scrap here.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"If one of dem freshies got injuries in dis place so bad it might git  out, an' dat would fix me.\"    \"I don't intend to use it on him unless I have to. Go ahead and explain  your trick. If it isn't straight I want my money back.\"    \"Dere won't be any money back, fer der trick is all right, all right.  Now stan' up here an' I'll show yer how it's did.\"    Kelley then showed Bruce how to bring the edge of his open hand down on  the upper side of an enemy's wrist just back of the joint.    \"Yer wants ter snap it like dis,\" Buster explained, illustrating with a  sharp, rebounding motion. \"If yer strikes him right dere wid der cushion  meat on der lower edge of yer hand an' snaps yer hand erway like dis,  it's dead sure ter break der bone. Jes' try it on yer own wrist, but be  careful not ter try it too hard.\"    Bruce did as directed, and he found that he hurt himself severely,  although he struck a very light blow.    \"Dat's ter trick,\" said Kelley, \"an' it's a dandy. Don't yer ever use it  'less yer dead sure yer wants ter break der odder feller's wrist.\"    Then the professor called up a colored boy, who rubbed Bruce down, and  the king of the sophomores finally departed.    As he walked back toward his room in the dusk of early evening,  Browning began to feel sorry that he had learned the trick at all.    \"It would be a dirty game to play on Merriwell,\" he muttered, \"but now  that I know it, I may get mad and do it in a huff, especially if I see  Merriwell is getting the best of me.\"    The "]]]
