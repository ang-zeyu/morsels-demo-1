This was prompt action on unofficial  information, for Davis' proclamation bore date of April 17, and Lyons'  despatch containing copies of it, sent on April 22, was not received by  Russell until May 10[153]. Ordinary news from the United States required  ten days to get into print in London[154], but official messages might  be sent more rapidly by way of telegraph to Halifax, thence by steamer  to Liverpool and by telegraph again to London. In case the telegram to  Halifax coincided with the departure of a fast vessel the time was  occasionally reduced to seven days, but never less. At the best the  exact information as to the contents of the Davis and Lincoln  proclamations of April 17 and 19 respectively, could have been received  only a few days before the order was issued to reinforce the  British fleet.    [Illustration: _Photo: F. Hollyer_. SIR WILLIAM GREGORY, K.C.M.G. (_From  Lady Gregory's \"Sir William Gregory, K.C.M.G.: An Autobiography,\" by  kind permission_)]    The next day, May 2, Ewart, in the Commons, asked \"if Privateers sailing  under the flag of an unrecognized Power will be dealt with as Pirates,\"  thus showing the immediate parliamentary concern at the Davis and  Lincoln proclamations. Russell stated in reply that a British fleet had  been sent to protect British interests and took occasion to indicate  British policy by adding, \"we have not been involved in any way in that  contest by any act or giving any advice in the matter, and, for God's  sake, let us if possible keep out of it[155].\" May 6, Gregory, a friend  of the South, who had already given notice of a motion for the  recognition of the Confederacy as an independent State, asked whether  the United States had been informed that a blockade of Southern ports  would not be recognized unless effective, and whether there would be  acquiescence in the belligerent right of the South to issue letters of  marque and reprisal[156]. Russell replied that Lincoln had _not_ been  informed that a blockade must be effective to be respected since the  Washington Government did not need to be told of an international rule  which it had itself long proclaimed. As to the second point, he now  announced what heretofore had not been clearly stated, that Southern  privateers could not be regarded by Great Britain as pirates, for if so  regarded Britain would herself have to treat them as pirates and would  thus be unneutral. This was in fact, in spite of Northern bitter  accusations that Britain was exhibiting governmental sympathy with the  South by her tolerance of the plan of Southern privateering, an  inescapable conclusion. Russell added, however, that the matter of  privateering involved some new questions under the Declaration of Paris  upon which the Government had not yet decided what stand to take[157].  It was on this same day, in fact, that Russell had instructed Cowley to  take up with France the question of the Declaration of Paris[158],  Privateering and blockade, declared in America months before there was  any possibility of putting them into effect, and months before there  were any military operations in the field, forced this rapid European  action, especially the action of Great Britain, which, more than any  other European nation, feared belligerent interference with her carrying  and export trade. How was the British Government to know that Davis  would not bend every energy in sending out privateers, and Lincoln to  establish a blockade? The respective declarations of Davis and Lincoln  were the _first_ evidences offered of belligerent status. It was  reasonable to assume that here would come the first energetic efforts of  the belligerents. Nor was British governmental intelligence sufficiently  informed to be aware that Davis, in fact, controlled few ships that  could be fitted out as privateers, or that two-thirds of the Northern  navy was at the moment widely scattered in foreign seas, making  impossible a prompt blockade.    To the British view the immediate danger to its commercial interests lay  in this announced maritime war, and it felt the necessity of defining  its neutral position with speed. The underlying fact of the fixity of  Southern determination to maintain secession had in the last few weeks  become clearly recognized.    Moreover the latest information sent by British officials in America,  some of it received just before the issue of the Proclamation of  Neutrality, some just after, was all confirmative of the rapid approach  of a great war. A letter from Bunch, at Charleston, was received on May  10, depicting the united Southern will to resist Northern attack, and  asserting that the South had no purpose save to conduct a strictly  defensive war. Bunch was no longer caustic; he now felt that a new  nation was in process of birth[159]. May 4, Monson, writing from  Washington, and just returned from a trip through the South, in the  course of which he had visited Montgomery, stated \"_no reconstruction_  of the Union is possible,\" and added that there was no danger of a  servile insurrection, a matter that now somewhat began to disturb the  British Government and public[160]. A few days later on, May 12, Lyons  expressed his strong sympathy with the North for reasons of  anti-slavery, law, and race, but added that he shrank from expressions  of sympathy for fear of thus encouraging the Northern Cabinet in its  plan of prosecuting civil war since such a war would be frightful in its  consequences both to America and to England[161].    Such reports if received before the issue of the Proclamation of  Neutrality must have strengthened the feeling that prompt action was  necessary; if received later, they gave confidence that that action had  been wise. May 9, Forster asked in the Commons a series of questions as  to the application of the British Foreign Enlistment Act in the American  crisis. What would be the status of British citizens serving on  Confederate privateers? How would the Government treat citizens who  aided in equipping such privateers? Did not the Government intend to  take measures to prevent the infringement of law in British ports? Here  was pressure by a friend of the North to hasten an official announcement  of the policy already notified to Parliament. Sir George Lewis replied  stating that the Government was about to issue a general proclamation  warning British subjects not to take any part in the war[162]. Similar  questions were asked by Derby in the Lords on May 10, and received a  similar answer[163]. The few days' delay following Russell's statement  of May 6 was due to consideration given by the Law Officers to the exact  form required. The Proclamation as issued was dated May 13, and was  officially printed in the _London Gazette_ on May 14.    In form and in substance the Proclamation of Neutrality did not differ  from customary usage[164]. It spoke of the Confederacy as \"states  styling themselves the Confederate States of America,\" prohibited to  Englishmen enlistment on either side, or efforts to enlist others, or  equipment of ships of war, or delivery of commissions to such ships. War  vessels being equipped in British ports would be seized and forfeited to  the British Government. If a belligerent war-ship came into a British  port, no change or increase of equipment was to be permitted. If a  subject violated the Proclamation he was both punishable in British  courts and forfeited any claim to British protection. The Parliamentary  discussion on May 16 brought out more clearly and in general unanimity  of opinion the policy of the Government in application of the  Proclamation; the South was definitely recognized as a belligerent, but  recognition of independence was for the future to determine; the right  of the South to send out privateers was regretfully recognized; such  privateers could not be regarded as pirates and the North would have no  right to treat them as such, but if the North in defiance of  international opinion did so treat them, Great Britain had at least  warned its subjects that they, if engaged in service on a Southern  privateer, had no claim to British protection; a blockade of the South  to be respected must be effective at least to the point where a vessel  attempting to pass through was likely to be captured; the plan of  blockading the entire Southern coast, with its three thousand miles of  coast line, was on the face of it ridiculous--evidence that Members of  Parliament were profoundly ignorant of the physical geography of the  Southern seaboard[165].    The Parliamentary discussion did not reveal any partiality for one side  in the American quarrel above the other. It turned wholly on legal  questions and their probable application. On May 15 Russell sent to  Lyons the official text of the Proclamation, but did not instruct him to  communicate it officially to Seward, leaving this rather to Lyons'  discretion. This was discretionary in diplomatic usage since in strict  fact the Proclamation was addressed to British subjects and need not be  communicated officially to the belligerents. In the result the  discretion permitted to Lyons had, an important bearing, for recognition  of Southern belligerency was opposed to the theory upon which the  Northern Government was attempting to proceed. Lyons did not then, or  later, make official communication to Seward of the Proclamation[166].  The fact soon appeared that the United States seriously objected to the  Proclamation of Neutrality, protesting first, its having been issued at  all, and, in the second place, resenting what was considered its  \"premature\" announcement by a friendly nation. This matter developed so  serious a criticism by both American Government and public, both during  and after the Civil War, that it requires a close examination. Did the  British Government exhibit an unfriendly attitude toward the North by a  \"premature\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#20)"],[1,"was that in the  carriage of his head that was astonishingly impressive. I shall never  forget him on one occasion, \"in '44,\" when he rose at a public meeting  to reply to an antagonist worthy of his steel. His whole soul was  roused, his high smooth forehead fairly coruscated. He remained silent  for some seconds, and only _looked_. The bald eagle never glanced  so fiercely from his eyry. It seemed as if his deep blue eye would  distend until it swallowed up the thousands of his audience. For an  instant the effect was painful; he saw it and smiled, when a cheer  burst from the admiring multitude that fairly shook the earth.    His voice was clear and sweet, and could be heard at an immense  distance, and yet, to be all like Demosthenes, he had a perceptible  impediment in his speech. As a reader he had no superior. His  narration was clear and unadorned, proper sentences were subduedly  humorous, but the impressive parts were delivered with an effect that  reminded me of the elder Kean.    His imagination was unsurpassed, and the rich stores of his mind  supplied him with never-ending material, quoted and original.  The slightest allusion to anything gave him the key to all its  peculiarities if he had occasion to allude to the diamond, its bed in  the Golconda, its discovery by some poor native, its being associated  with commerce, its polish by the lapidary, its adorning the neck  of beauty, its rays brilliant and serene, its birth, its life,  its history, all flashed upon him. So with every idea in the vast  storehouse of his mind. He seemed to know all things, in mass and in  particulars, never confused, never at a loss--the hearer listened,  wondered, and dreamed. Thoughts of moment came forth as demanded, but  ten thousand other thoughts rare and beautiful, continued to bubble  up, after all effort ceased.    No man had a more delicate or subtle wit than Prentiss, or a more  Falstaffian humor when it suited his purpose. Who will ever forget the  spending of a social dinner hour with him, when his health was high  and his mind at ease? Who so lovely?--who so refined? What delight  was exhibited by sweet ladies who listened to his words! Who could  so eloquently discourse of roses and buds, of lilies and pearls, of  eyes and graces, of robes and angels, and yet never offend the most  sensitive of the sex, or call other than the blush of pleasure and  joy to the cheek? Who could, on the \"public day,\" ascend so gracefully  from the associations of tariffs, and banks, and cotton, and sugar,  to greet the fair ladies that honored him with their presence? How  he would lean toward them, as he dwelt upon \"the blessed of all God's  handiwork,\" compared their bright eyes to \"day-stars\" that lit up the  dark recesses of his own clouded imagination; and how he would revel,  like another Puck, among the rays and beams of smiles called forth by  his own happy compliments--and how he would change from all this, and  in an instant seemingly arm himself with the thunderbolts of Jove,  which he would dash with appalling sound among his antagonists, or at  principles he opposed, and yet with such a charm, with such a manner,  that these very daughters of the sunny South who had listened to his  syren-song so admiringly, would now stare, and wonder, and pallor, and  yet listen, even as one gazes over the precipice, and is fascinated at  the very nearness to destruction.    Prentiss had originally a constitution of iron; his frame was so  perfect in its organization, that, in spite of the most extraordinary  negligence of health, his muscles had all the compactness, glossiness,  and distinctiveness of one who had specially trained by diet and  exercise. It was this constitution that enabled him to accomplish  so much in so short a time. He could almost wholly discard sleep for  weeks, with apparent impunity; he could eat or starve; do anything  that would kill ordinary men, yet never feel a twinge of pain. I  saw him once amidst a tremendous political excitement; he had been  talking, arguing, dining, visiting, and traveling, without rest for  three whole days. His companions would steal away at times for sleep,  but Prentiss was like an ever-busy spirit, here, and there, and  everywhere. The morning of the fourth day came, and he was to appear  before an audience familiar with his fame, but one that had never  heard him speak; an audience critical in the last degree, he desired  to succeed, for more was depending than he had ever before had cause  to stake upon such an occasion. Many felt a fear that he would be  unprepared. I mingled in the expecting crowd: I saw ladies who had  never honored the stump with their presence struggling for seats,  counselors, statesmen, and professional men, the elite of a great  city, were gathered together. An hour before I had seen Prentiss,  still apparently ignorant of his engagement.    The time of trial came, and the remarkable man presented himself,  the very picture of buoyant health, of unbroken rest. All this had  been done _by the unyielding resolve of his will_--his triumph was  complete; high-wrought expectations were more than realized, prejudice  was demolished, professional jealousy silenced, and he descended from  the rostrum, freely accorded his proper place among the orators and  statesmen of the \"Southern Metropolis.\"    Mr. Clay visited the South in the fall of '44, and, as he was  then candidate for the Presidency, he attracted in New Orleans, if  possible, more than usual notice. His hotel was the St. Charles;  toward noon he reached that magnificent palace. The streets presented  a vast ocean of heads, and every building commanding a view was  literally covered with human beings. The great \"Statesman of the West\"  presented himself to the multitude between the tall columns of the  finest portico in the world. The scene was beyond description, and of  vast interest. As the crowd swayed to and fro, a universal shout was  raised for Mr. Clay to speak; he uttered a sentence or two, waved his  hand in adieu, and escaped amidst the prevailing confusion. Prentiss  meanwhile was at a side window, evidently unconscious of being himself  noticed, gazing upon what was passing with all the delight of the  humblest spectator. Suddenly his name was announced. He attempted to  withdraw from public gaze, but his friends pushed him forward. Again  his name was shouted, hats and caps were thrown in the air, and he  was finally compelled to show himself on the portico. With remarkable  delicacy, he chose a less prominent place than that previously  occupied by Mr. Clay, although perfectly visible. He thanked his  friends for their kindness by repeated bows, and by such smiles as he  alone could give. \"A speech! A speech!\" thundered a thousand voices.  Prentiss lifted his hand; in an instant everything was still--then  pointing to the group that surrounded Mr. Clay, he said,  \"Fellow-citizens, when the eagle is soaring in the sky, the owls  and the bats retire to their holes.\" And long before the shout that  followed this remark had ceased, Prentiss had disappeared amid the  multitude.    But the most extraordinary exhibition of Prentiss' powers of mind and  endurance of body, was shown while he was running for Congress. He  had the whole State to canvass, and the magnitude of the work was just  what he desired. From what I have learned from anecdotes, that canvass  must have presented some scenes combining the highest mental and  physical exertion that was ever witnessed in the world. Prentiss was  in perfect health, and in the first blush of success, and it cannot be  doubted but that his best efforts of oratory were then made, and now  live recorded only in the fading memories of his hearers. An incident  illustrative of the time is remembered, that may hear repeating.    The whole state of Mississippi was alive with excitement; for the  moment, she felt that her sovereign dignity had been trifled with,  and that her reputation demanded the return of Prentiss to Congress.  Crowds followed him from place to place, making a gala time of weeks  together. Among the shrewd worldlings who take advantage of such times  \"to coin money,\" was the proprietor of a traveling menagerie, and he  soon found out that the multitude followed Prentiss. Getting the list  of that remarkable man's \"appointments,\" he filled up his own, and it  was soon noticed as a remarkable coincidence, that the orator always  \"arrived along with the other 'lions.'\" The reason of this meeting was  discovered, and the \"boys\" decided that Prentiss should \"next time\"  speak from the top of the lion's cage. Never was the menagerie more  crowded. At the proper time, the candidate gratified his constituents,  and mounted his singular rostrum. I was told by a person, who  professed to be an eye witness, that the whole affair presented a  singular mixture of the terrible and the comical. Prentiss was, as  usual, eloquent, and, as if ignorant of the novel circumstances with  which he was surrounded, went deeply into the matter in hand, his  election. For a while the audience and the animals were quiet, the  former listening, the latter eyeing the speaker with grave intensity.  The first burst of applause electrified the menagerie; the elephant  threw his trunk into the air and echoed back the noise, while the  tigers and bears significantly growled. On went Prentiss, and as each  peculiar animal vented his rage or approbation, he most ingeniously  wrought in its habits, as a facsimile of some man or passion. In the  meanwhile, the stately king of beasts, who had been quietly treading  the mazes of his prison, became alarmed at the footsteps over  his head, and placing his mouth upon the floor of his cage, made  everything shake by his terrible roar. This, joined with the already  excited feelings of the audience, caused the ladies to shriek, and  a fearful commotion for a moment followed. Prentiss, equal to every  occasion, "]]]
