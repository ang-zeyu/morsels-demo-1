Just as is the  body dependent for growth upon the nourishment taken into it, so is the  mind dependent for growth upon the impressions received from the  Universe--and these impressions come largely through the senses. It may  be objected to that we know many things that we have not received through  our senses. But, does the objector include the impressions that came  through his senses in some previous existence, and which have been  impressed upon his instinctive mind, or soul-memory? It is true that  there are higher senses than those usually recognized, but Nature insists  upon one learning the lessons of the lower grades before attempting those  of the higher.    Do not forget that all that we know we have \"worked for.\" There is  nothing that comes to the idler, or shirker. What we know is merely the  result of \"stored-up accumulations of previous experience,\" as Lewes has  so well said.    So it will be seen that the Yogi idea that one should develop all parts  of the Mind is strictly correct, if one will take the trouble to examine  into the matter. A man sees and knows but very little of what is going  on about him. His limitations are great. His powers of vision report only  a few vibrations of light, while below and above the scale lie an  infinity of vibrations unknown to him. The same is true of the powers of  hearing, for only a comparatively small portion of the sound-waves reach  the Mind of Man--even some of the animals hear more than he does.    If a man had only one sense he would obtain but a one-sense idea of the  outside world. If another sense is added his knowledge is doubled. And so  on. The best proof of the relation between increased sense perception and  development is had in the study of the evolution of animal forms. In the  early stages of life the organism has only the sense of feeling--and very  dim at that--and a faint sense of taste. Then developed smell, hearing  and sight, each marking a distinct advance in the scale of life, for a  new world has been opened out to the advancing forms of life. And, when  man develops new senses--and this is before the race--he will be a much  wiser and greater being.    Carpenter, many years ago, voiced a thought that will be familiar to  those who are acquainted with the Yogi teachings regarding the unfoldment  of new senses. He said: \"It does not seem at all improbable that there  are properties of matter of which none of our senses can take immediate  cognizance, and which other beings might be formed to perceive in the  same manner as we are sensible to light, sound, etc.\"    And Isaac Taylor said: \"It may be that within the field observed by the  visible and ponderable universe there is existing and moving another  element fraught with another species of life--corporeal, indeed, and  various in its orders, but not open to cognizance of those who are  confined to the conditions of animal organization. Is it to be thought  that the eye of man is the measure of the Creator's power?--and that He  created nothing but that which he has exposed to our present senses? The  contrary seems much more than barely possible; ought we not to think it  almost certain?\"    Another writer. Prof. Masson, has said: \"If a new sense or two were added  to the present normal number, in man, that which is now the phenomenal  world for all of us might, for all that we know, burst into something  amazingly different and wider, in consequence of the additional  revelations of these new senses.\"    But not only is this true, but Man may increase his powers of knowledge  and experience if he will but develop the senses he has to a higher  degree of efficiency, instead of allowing them to remain comparatively  atrophied. And toward this end, this lesson is written.    The Mind obtains its impressions of objects of the outside world by means  of the brain and sense organs. The sensory organs are the instruments of  the Mind, as is also the brain and the entire nervous system. By means of  the nerves, and the brain, the Mind makes use of the sensory organs in  order that it may obtain information regarding external objects.    The senses are usually said to consist of five different forms, _viz._,  sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste.    The Yogis teach that there are higher senses, undeveloped, or  comparatively so, in the majority of the race, but toward the unfoldment  of which the race is tending. But we shall not touch upon these latent  senses in this lesson, as they belong to another phase of the subject. In  addition to the five senses above enumerated, some physiologists and  psychologists have held that there were several others in evidence. For  instance, the sense by which the inner organs revealed their presence and  condition, The muscular system reports to the mind through some sense  that is not that of \"touch,\" although closely allied to it. And the  feelings of hunger, thirst, etc., seem to come to us through an unnamed  sense.    Bernstein has distinguished between the five senses and the one just  referred to as follows: \"The characteristic distinction between these  common sensations and the sensations of the senses is that by the latter  we gain knowledge of the occurrences and objects which belong to the  external world (and which sensations we refer to external objects),  whilst by the former we only feel conditions of our own body.\"    A sensation is the internal, mental conception, resulting from an  external object or fact exciting the sense organs and nerves, and the  brain, thus making the mind \"aware\" of the external object or fact. As  Bain has said, it is the \"mental impression, feeling, or conscious state,  resulting from the action of external things on some part of the body,  called on that account, sensitive.\"    Each channel of sense impressions has an organ, or organs, peculiarly  adapted for the excitation of its substance by the particular kind of  vibrations through which it receives impressions. The eye is most  cunningly and carefully designed to receive the light-waves; and  sound-waves produce no effect upon it. And, likewise, the delicate  mechanism of the ear responds only to sound-waves; light-waves failing to  register upon it. Each set of sensations is entirely different, and the  organs and nerves designed to register each particular set are peculiarly  adapted to their own special work. The organs of sense, including their  special nervous systems, may be compared to a delicate instrument that  the mind has fashioned for itself, that it may investigate, examine and  obtain reports from the outside world.    We have become so accustomed to the workings of the senses that we take  them as a \"matter of course,\" and fail to recognize them as the delicate  and wonderful instruments that they are--designed and perfected by the  mind for its own use. If we will think of the soul as designing,  manufacturing and using these instruments, we may begin to understand  their true relations to our lives, and, accordingly treat them with more  respect and consideration.    We are in the habit of thinking that we are aware of all the sensations  received by our mind. But this is very far from being correct. The  unconscious regions of the mind are incomparably larger than the small  conscious area that we generally think of when we say \"my mind.\" In  future lessons we shall proceed to consider this wonderful area, and  examine what is to be found there. Taine has well said, \"There is going  on within us a subterranean process of infinite extent; its products  alone are known to us, and are only known to us in the mass. As to  elements, and their elements, consciousness does not attain to them. They  are to sensations what secondary molecules and primitive molecules are to  bodies. We get a glance here and there at obscure and infinite worlds  extending beneath our distinct sensations. These are compounds and  wholes. For their elements to be perceptible to consciousness, it is  necessary for them to be added together, and so to acquire a certain bulk  and to occupy a certain time, for if the group does not attain this bulk,  and does not last this time, we observe no changes in our state.  Nevertheless, though it escapes us, there is one.\"    But we must postpone our consideration of this more than interesting  phase of the subject, until some future lesson, when we shall take a trip  into the regions of Mind, under and above Consciousness. And a most  wonderful trip many of us will find it, too.    For the present, we must pay our attention to the channels by which the  material for knowledge and thought enter our minds. For these sense  impressions, coming to us from without, are indeed \"material\" upon which  the mind works in order to manufacture the product called \"Thought.\"    This material we obtain through the channels of the senses, and then  store in that wonderful storehouse, the Memory, from whence we bring out  material from time to time, which we proceed to weave into the fabric of  Thought. The skill of the worker depends upon his training, and his  ability to select and combine the proper materials. And the acquiring of  good materials to be stored up is an important part of the work.    A mind without stored-up material of impressions and experiences would be  like a factory without material. The machinery would have nothing upon  which to work, and the shop would be idle. As Helmholtz has said,  \"Apprehension by the senses supplies directly or indirectly, the material  of all human knowledge, or at least the stimulus necessary to develop  every inborn faculty of the mind.\" And Herbert Spencer, has this to say  of this phase of the subject, \"It is almost a truism to say that in  proportion to the numerousness of the objects that can be distinguished,  and in proportion to the variety of coexistences and sequences that can"]]]
