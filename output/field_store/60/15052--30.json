The narrative of Mrs. Thumb and  her pudding is more circumstantial than that of King Alfred and the  housewife; and if the tradition is worthless, it serves us so far,  that it faithfully portrays a favourite item of rustic consumption in  old times. We are told that the pudding was made in a bowl, and that  it was chiefly composed of the flesh and blood of a newly-killed hog,  laid in batter; and then, when all was ready, the bag with all its  savoury burden was put into a kettle.    As we are already on the threshold of legend and myth, we may linger  there a moment to recall to memory the resemblance between the  description of this piece of handiwork and that ascribed to good King  Arthur, who lived in days when monarchs were their own _chefs_,  for the Arthurian dish was also prepared in a bag, and consisted,  according to the ditty, of barley-meal and fat. Soberly speaking, the  two accounts belong, maybe, to something like the same epoch in the  annals of gastronomy; and a large pudding was, for a vast length  of time, no doubt, a prevailing _piece de resistance_ in all  frugal British households. It was the culinary forefather of  toad-in-the-hole, hot-pot, Irish stew, and of that devil-dreaded  Cornish pasty. The Elizabethan transmitters of these two Apician  nuggets possibly antedated the popular institution of the bag-pudding;  but the ancientest gastronomical records testify to the happy  introduction of the frying-pan about the era when we were under  Alfred's fatherly sway. It may have even preceded the grill, just  as the fork lagged behind the spoon, from which it is a seeming  evolution. That no reader may doubt the fact, that Tom's mother made  the pudding, and that Tom held the candle, we refer to the old edition  of this choice piece of chapman's ware, where an accurate drawing of  Mrs. Thumb, and the board, and the bowl, and Tom with the candle, may  be inspected. The _prima stamina_ of the modern fruit-pudding really  appear to be found in the ancient bag-pudding, of which Tom Thumb had  such excellent reason to be acquainted with the contents. The mode  of construction was similar, and both were boiled in a cloth. The  material and subsidiary treatment of course differed; but it is  curious that no other country possesses either the tart or the  pudding, as we understand them, and as the latter has perhaps been  developed from the dish, of the making of which Tom Thumb was  an eye-witness to his sorrow, so the covered fruit tart may not  improbably be an outgrowth from the old coffin pasty of venison or  game, with the superaddition of a dish for the safe custody of the  juice.    Another rather prominent factor in the diet of the poor classes, not  only in Scotland but in the North of England, was oatmeal variously  prepared. One very favourable and palatable way was by grinding the  meal a second time as fine as flour, boiling it, and then serving it  with hot milk or treacle. There is something in the nature of this  food so peculiarly satisfying and supporting, that it seems to have  been destined to become the staple nourishment of a poor population  in a cold and bracing climate. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  unquestionably saw a great advance in the mystery of cookery and  in the diversity of dishes, and the author of \"Piers of Fulham\"  complains, that men were no longer satisfied with brawn and powdered  beef, which he terms \"store of house,\" but would have venison, wild  fowl, and heronshaw; and men of simple estate, says he, will have  partridges and plovers, when lords lack. He adds quaintly:      \"A mallard of the dunghill is good enough for me,    With pleasant pickle, or it is else poison. pardy.\"    We have for our purpose a very serviceable relic of the old time,  called \"A Merry Jest, how the Ploughman learned his Paternoster.\" The  scene purports to be laid in France, and the general outline may have  been taken from the French; but it is substantially English, with  allusions to Kent, Robin Hood, and so forth, and it certainly  illustrates the theme upon which we are. This ploughman was in fact a  farmer or husbandman, and the account of his dwelling and garden-stuff  is very interesting. We are told that his hall-roof was full of  bacon-flitches, and his store-room of eggs, butter, and cheese. He had  plenty of malt to make good ale--      \"And Martlemas beef to him was not dainty;    Onions and Garlic had he enough,    And good cream, and milk of the cow.\"    But in \"Vox Populi Vox Dei,\" written about 1547, and therefore  apparently not from the pen of Skelton, who died in 1529, it is said  that the price of an ox had risen to four pounds, and a sheep without  the wool to twelve shillings and upwards, so that the poor man could  seldom afford to have meat at his table. This evil the writer ascribes  to the exactions of the landlord and the lawyer. The former charged  too highly for his pastures, and the latter probably advanced money on  terms. The old poem depicts in sad colours the condition of the  yeoman at the same period, that had had once plenty of cows and cream,  butter, eggs, cheese, and honey; all which had gone to enrich upstarts  who throve by casting-counters and their pens. The story of the \"King  and a poor Northern Man,\" 1640, also turns upon the tyranny of the  lawyers over ignorant clients.    The \"Serving-man's Comfort,\" 1598, draws a somewhat gloomy picture  of the times. The prices of all provisions, among other points, had  trebled since the good old days, when his father and grandfather kept  house. Then people could buy an ox for 20s., a sheep for 3s., a calf  for 2s., a goose for 6d., a capon for 4d., a hen for 2d., a pig for  the same, and all other household provisions at a like rate. The  reason given by the farmer was that the landlords had raised their  rent. Let them have the land on the old terms, and the former prices  would pay. This plea and demand have come back home to us in 1886.    The tradition is, that when Queen Elizabeth received the intelligence  of the defeat of the Armada, she was dining off a goose--doubtless  about eleven o'clock in the morning. It was an anxious moment, and  perhaps her majesty for the moment had thrown ceremony somewhat aside,  and was \"keeping secret house.\"    The author of the \"Serving-man's Comfort,\" 1598, also laments the  decay of hospitality. \"Where,\" he inquires \"are the great chines  of stalled beef, the great, black jacks of double beer, the long  hall-tables fully furnished with good victuals?\" But he seems to have  been a stickler for the solid fare most in vogue, according to his  complaint, formerly; and he represents to us that in lieu of it one  had to put up with goose-giblets, pigs' pettitoes, and so many other  boiled meats, forced meats, and made dishes. Things were hardly so  very bad, however, if, as he states previously, the curtailment of the  expenditure on the table still left, as a medium repast, two or three  dishes, with fruit and cheese after. The black jack here mentioned was  not discarded till comparatively modern days. Nares, who published his  Glossary in 1822, states that he recollects them in use.    \"A meal's meat twice a week, worth a groat,\" is mentioned as the farm  servant's portion in \"Civil and Uncivil Life,\" 1579. In \"A Piece of  Friar Bacon's Brasen-heads Prophesie,\" a unique poem, 1604, we read  that at that time a cheesecake and a pie were held \"good country  meat.\" The author adds:      \"Ale and Spice, and Curdes and Creame,    Would make a Scholler make a Theame.\"    Breton, in his \"Fantasticks,\" 1626, observes: \"Milk, Butter and Cheese  are the labourers dyet; and a pot of good Beer quickens his spirits.\"    Norfolk dumplings were celebrated in John Day the playwright's time.  He has put into the mouth of his east-country yeoman's son, Tom  Strowd, in \"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green,\" written long before  it was printed in 1659, the following:--\"As God mend me, and ere  thou com'st into Norfolk, I'll give thee as good a dish of Norfolk  dumplings as ere thou laydst thy lips to;\" and in another passage of  the same drama, where Swash's shirt has been stolen, while he is in  bed, he describes himself \"as naked as your Norfolk dumplin.\" In  the play just quoted, Old Strowd, a Norfolk yeoman, speaks of his  contentment with good beef, Norfolk bread, and country home-brewed  drink; and in the \"City Madam,\" 1658, Holdfast tells us that before  his master got an estate, \"his family fed on roots and livers, and  necks of beef on Sundays.\" I cite these as traits of the kind of  table kept by the lower grades of English society in the seventeenth  century.

MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, i, 1.      The manufacture of wine and of fruit preserves, and many of the  processes of cookery, could have scarcely been accomplished without a  large and constant supply of sugar.    The exact date of the first introduction of the latter into England  continues to be a matter of uncertainty. It was clearly very scarce,  and doubtless equally dear, when, in 1226, Henry III. asked the Mayor  of Winchester to procure him three pounds of Alexandria sugar, if so  much could be got, and also some rose and violet-coloured sugar;  nor had it apparently grown much more plentiful when the same prince  ordered the sheriffs of London to send him four loaves of sugar to  Woodstock. But it soon made its way into the English homes, and before  the end of the thirteenth century it could be procured even in remote  provincial towns. It was sold either by the loaf or the pound. It was  still exorbitantly high in price, varying from eighteen pence to  three shillings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#20)"],[1," or two, for mothers      stood about with little brown kiddies on their backs as though they      really would like to offer them to us but hardly dared.        The temple priest was a good looking, smooth-faced chap, and hidden      under his coat he brought dozens of skins. I believe that his religious      vows did not allow him to handle animals--openly--and so he would      beckon Roy into the darkness of the temple with a most mysterious air,      and would extract all sorts of things from his sleeves just like a      sleight-of-hand performer. He was a rich man when we left!        The people are mostly tribesmen--Mosos, Lolos, Tibetans, and many      others. The girls wear their hair \"bobbed off\" in front and with a long      plait in back. They wash their hair once--on their wedding day--and      then it is wrapped up in turbans for the rest of their lives. The      Tibetan women dress their hair in dozens of tiny braids, but I don't      believe there is any authority that they ever wash it, or themselves      either.    Li-chiang was our first collecting camp and we never had a better one. On  the morning after our arrival Heller found mammals in half his traps, and  in the afternoon we each put out a line of forty traps which brought us  fifty mammals of eleven species. This was a wonderful relief after the many  days of travel through country devoid of animal life.    Our traps contained shrews of two species, meadow voles, Asiatic  white-footed mice, spiny mice, rats, squirrels, and tree shrews. The small  mammals were exceedingly abundant and easy to catch, but after the first  day we began to have difficulty with the natives who stole our traps. We  usually marked them with a bit of cotton, and the boys would follow an  entire line down a hedge, taking every one. Sometimes they even brought  specimens to us for sale which we knew had been caught in our stolen traps!    The traps were set under logs and stumps and in the grass where we found  the \"runways\" or paths which mice, rats and voles often make. These animals  begin to move about just after dark, and we usually would inspect our traps  with a lantern about nine o'clock in the evening. This not only gave the  trap a double chance to be filled but we also secured perfect specimens,  for such species as mice and shrews are cannibalistic, and almost every  night, if the specimens were not taken out early in the evening, several  would be partly eaten.    Small mammals are often of much greater interest and importance  scientifically than large ones, for, especially among the Insectivores,  there are many primitive forms which are apparently of ancestral stock and  throw light on the evolutionary history of other living groups.    Li-chiang is a fur market of considerable importance for the Tibetans bring  down vast quantities of skins for sale and trade. Lambs, goats, foxes,  cats, civets, pandas, and flying squirrels hang in the shops and there are  dozens of fur dressers who do really excellent tanning.    This city is a most interesting place especially on market day, for its  inhabitants represent many different tribes with but comparatively few  Chinese. By far the greatest percentage of natives are the Mosos who are  semi-Tibetan in their life and customs. They were originally an independent  race who ruled a considerable part of northern Yün-nan, and Li-chiang was  their ancient capital. To the effeminate and \"highly civilized\" Chinese  they are \"barbarians,\" but we found them to be simple, honest and wholly  delightful people. Many of those whom we met later had never seen a white  woman, and yet their inherent decency was in the greatest contrast to that  of the Chinese who consider themselves so immeasurably their superior.    The Mosos have large herds of sheep and cattle, and this is the one place  in the Orient except in large cities along the coast, where we could obtain  fresh milk and butter. As with the Tibetans, buttered tea and _tsamba_  (parched oatmeal) are the great essentials, but they also grow quantities  of delicious vegetables and fruit. Buttered tea is prepared by churning  fresh butter into hot tea until the two have become well mixed. It is then  thickened with finely ground _tsamba_ until a ball is formed which is eaten  with the fingers. The combination is distinctly good when the ingredients  are fresh, but if the butter happens to be rancid the less said of it the  better.    The natives of this region are largely agriculturists and raise great  quantities of squash, turnips, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, onions, corn,  peas, beans, oranges, pears, persimmons and nuts. While traveling we filled  our saddle pockets with pears and English walnuts or chestnuts and could  replenish our stock at almost any village along the road.    Everything was absurdly cheap. Eggs were usually about eight cents  (Mexican) a dozen, and we could always purchase a chicken for an empty tin  can, or two for a bottle. In fact, the latter was the greatest desideratum  and when offers of money failed to induce a native to pose for the camera a  bottle nearly always would decide matters in our favor.    In Li-chiang we learned that there was good shooting only twelve miles  north of the city on the Snow Mountain range, the highest peak of which  rises 18,000 feet above the sea. We left a part of our outfit at Mr. Kok's  house and engaged a caravan of seventeen mules to take us to the hunting  grounds. Mr. Kok assisted us in numberless ways while we were in the  vicinity of Li-chiang and in other parts of the country. He took charge of  all our mail, sending it to us by runners, loaned us money when it was  difficult to get cash from Ta-li Fu and helped us to engage servants and  caravans.    It had rained almost continually for five days and a dense gray curtain of  fog hung far down in the valley, but on the morning of October 11 we awoke  to find ourselves in another world. We were in a vast amphitheater of  encircling mountains, white almost to their bases, rising ridge on ridge,  like the foamy billows of a mighty ocean. At the north, silhouetted against  the vivid blue of a cloudless sky, towered the great Snow Mountain, its  jagged peaks crowned with gold where the morning sun had kissed their  summits. We rode toward it across a level rock-strewn plain and watched the  fleecy clouds form, and float upward to weave in and out or lose themselves  in the vast snow craters beside the glacier. It was an inspiration, that  beautiful mountain, lying so white and still in its cradle of dark green  trees. Each hour it seemed more wonderful, more dominating in its grandeur,  and we were glad to be of the chosen few to look upon its sacred beauty.    In the early afternoon we camped in a tiny temple which nestled into a  grove of spruce trees on the outskirts of a straggling village. To the  north the Snow Mountain rose almost above us, and on the east and south a  grassy rock-strewn plain rolled away in gentle undulations to a range of  hills which jutted into the valley like a great recumbent dragon.    A short time after our camp was established we had a visit from an Austrian  botanist, Baron Haendel-Mazzetti, who had been in the village for two  weeks. He had come to Yün-nan for the Vienna Museum before the war,  expecting to remain a year, but already had been there three. Surrounded as  he was by Tibet, Burma, and Tonking, his only possible exit was by way of  the four-month overland journey to Shanghai. He had little money and for  two years had been living on Chinese food. He dined with us in the evening,  and his enjoyment of our coffee, bread, kippered herring, and other canned  goods was almost pathetic.    A week after our arrival Baron Haendel-Mazzetti left for Yün-nan Fu and  eventually reached Shanghai which, however, became a closed port to him  upon China's entry into the European war. It is to be hoped that his  collections, which must be of great scientific value and importance, have  arrived at a place of safety long ere this book issues from the press.          CHAPTER XIII      CAMPING IN THE CLOUDS    We hired four Moso hunters in the Snow Mountain village. They were  picturesque fellows, supposedly dressed in skins, but their garments were  so ragged and patched that it was difficult to determine the original  material of which they were made.    One of them was armed with a most extraordinary gun which, it was said,  came from Tibet. Its barrel was more than six feet long, and the stock was  curved like a golf stick. A powder fuse projected from a hole in the side  of the barrel, and just behind it on the butt was fastened a forked spring.  At his waist the man carried a long coil of rope, the slowly burning end of  which was placed in the crotched spring. When about to shoot the native  placed the butt of the weapon against his cheek, pressed the spring so that  the burning rope's end touched the powder fuse, and off went the gun.    The three other hunters carried crossbows and poisoned arrows. They were  remarkably good shots and at a distance of one hundred feet could place an  arrow in a six-inch circle four times out of five. We found later that  crossbows are in common use throughout the more remote parts of Yün-nan and  were only another evidence that we had suddenly dropped back into the  Middle Ages and, with our high-power rifles and twentieth century  equipment, were anachronisms.    The natives are able to obtain a good deal of game even with such primitive  weapons for they depend largely upon dogs which bring gorals and serows to  bay against a cliff and hold them until the men arrive. The dogs are a  mongrel breed which appears to be largely hound, and some are really  excellent hunters. White is the usual color but a few are mixed black and  brown, or fox red. Hotenfa, one of our Mosos, owned a good pack and we all  came to love its big red leader. This fine dog could be depended upon to"]]]
