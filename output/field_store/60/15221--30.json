We are satisfied that the findings contained in each of paragraphs 348  and 377 are collateral assessments of conduct made outside of and were  not needed to answer any part of the terms of reference. The  Commissioner had no authority or jurisdiction to deal with the affected  officers in such a fashion and the findings themselves are a regrettable  addition to the Report.      Fairness    The concept of natural justice does not rest upon carefully defined  rules or standards that must always be applied in the same fixed way.  Nor is it possible to find answers to issues which really depend on  fairness and commonsense by legalistic or theoretical approaches. What  is needed is a broad and balanced assessment of what has happened and  been done in the general environment of the case under consideration.    In the present case the expressed complaints turn upon the absence of  warning that the affected officers were at risk and that the critical  decisions taken against them were unsupported by any evidence of  probative value. But in estimating the significance of these complaints  it would be unreal to ignore the fact that the findings are not only  very serious in themselves: they are made more potent by the way they  have been so closely associated with one another. Furthermore, each of  them is advanced in this Report as an overt manifestation of one general  conspiracy. That last matter has special importance because for the  reasons just explained we have held the conspiracy findings to be  unjustified. They should never have been made. In saying that we do not  overlook the fact that this Court is making an assessment in isolation  from the viva voce evidence given at open hearings of the Inquiry. But  the present issue is simply whether the affected officers were or were  not deprived of the advantage of answering unformulated charges. In such  a situation the advantage of actually hearing and seeing a witness is  hardly a relevant consideration.    In the course of the survey that has been made up to this point we have  commented upon the nature and significance of the various challenged  paragraphs in the Report. It is unnecessary to traverse the same subject  matter once again and we simply remark that the applicants have  justified their complaints concerning the way in which the findings have  been reached.      Award of Costs    We have explained earlier in this judgment that an order for costs was  made against Air New Zealand in favour of parties other than the Civil  Aviation Division. As a matter of company policy the airline decided  that it would comply with that order although in doing so it has made no  admission that the order was validly made. In addition, however, the  airline was ordered to pay the Department of Justice the large sum of  $150,000 by way of contribution to the public cost of the inquiry. It is  that last order which is challenged in the present proceedings on two  grounds. The first is that the award involved a wrong exercise of the  discretion provided by s. 11 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908. The  second ground is that in any event no award greater than $600 could be  made by reason of Rule III of rules made in terms of the statute and  gazetted on 11th February 1904.    The reasons given by the Commissioner for making the respective orders  against Air New Zealand are set out in a passage from the appendix to  the Report which is mentioned in this judgment under the heading  \"Airline's attitude at Inquiry\". And on behalf of the Attorney-General  it is said that the discretion was properly exercised for reasons  expressed to be related to \"conduct at the hearing (which materially and  unnecessarily extended the duration of the hearing)[2]\". However, the  reasons given[3] by the Commissioner do not stop there. The appendix goes  on--         \"The management of the airline instructed its counsel to deny every       allegation of fault, and to counter-attack by ascribing total       culpability to the air crew ... Apart from that, there were       material elements of information in the possession of the airline       which were originally not disclosed ... it was not a question of       the airline putting all its cards on the table. The cards were       produced reluctantly, and at long intervals, and I have little       doubt that there are one or two which still lie hidden in the       pack.\"    When discussing the legal implications of the order for costs under that  particular heading earlier in the judgment we stated that on purely  verbal grounds it might be possible to draw refined distinctions between  parts of the Report which are highly critical of the position taken up  by the airline at the inquiry on the one hand and the effect this had on  the duration of the hearing on the other. But there can be no doubt that  in the context of this Report and the conclusions reached by the  Commissioner concerning conspiracy and otherwise any ordinary reader  would feel satisfied that the imposition of an order for costs in the  sum of $150,000 was nothing less than the exaction of a penalty. In  those circumstances and by reason of the conclusions we have reached  concerning the invalidity of the challenged paragraphs we are satisfied  that the order must be set aside.    Concerning the second ground advanced on behalf of the airline it is  sufficient to say that even if it had been appropriate to make an award  of costs in this case the amount was limited to the modest sum of $600.    At the beginning of this judgment we said that we had felt it necessary  to go at some length into the facts. This we have done both in order to  analyse the important questions raised in the areas of natural justice  and excess of jurisdiction and also because we have thought it to be in  the public interest to attempt to explain the factual issues that are  involved in the proceedings. We now express our conclusion that for the  reasons already given we are satisfied that the complaints of the  applicants are justified. Against that finding we return to the  beginning of this judgment where we said that we felt sure that  reputation can be vindicated and the interests of justice met by a  formal decision of this Court that will have the effect of quashing the  order of the Commissioner requiring Air New Zealand to pay costs in the  large sum of $150,000. We would make an order accordingly.    The Court being unanimous as to the result there will be an order  quashing the order of the Royal Commissioner that Air New Zealand pay to  the Department of Justice the sum of $150,000 by way of contribution to  the public cost of the Inquiry. There have been no submissions  concerning the costs of the present proceedings and that matter is  reserved.      _Solicitors_    Messrs.

Had those khaki-clothed warriors been carved out of  bronze and moved by machinery, they could not have shown less fear or more  perfect discipline. The pom-pom is a gun which I have been told the British  War Office refused as a toy some two years back. I have had the doubtful  pleasure of being under its fire to-day, and all I can say is that I would  gladly have given my place to any gentleman in the War Office who happens  to hold the notion that the pom-pom is a toy.    Somehow the enemy got hold of the position where General Rundle and staff  were located, and all the afternoon they swept the plain in front of the  tents, the hills above, and the hill opposite with shells; but they could  not quite drop one in the little ravine itself. Half an hour before sundown  I had to ride with two other correspondents to headquarters to get a  dispatch away. We got across safely, but had not been there five minutes  before a grandly directed shell sent the General and his staff off the brow  of the hill in double quick time. We delivered our dispatches, and were  getting ready for a gallop over the quarter mile of veldt, when, _pom,  pom, pom, pom_, came a dozen one-pounders a few yards away right across  our track. It made our hearts sit very close to our ribs, but there was  nothing for it but to take our horses by the head, drive the spurs home,  and ride as if we were rounding up wild cattle. I want it to stand on  record that I was not the last man across that strip of veldt. There was  not much incident in the day's fighting; there seldom is in an artillery  duel, carried on by men who know the game, in hilly country. Once during  the afternoon the big gun belonging to the Boers became so troublesome that  half a dozen of ours were trained upon it, and for best part of an hour it  sounded as if a section of Sheol had visited the earth, so deadly was the  fire, so fierce the bursting missiles, that not a rock wallaby, crouching  in its hole, could have lived twenty minutes in the location. We heard no  more from that gun.    As I rode from position to position our fellows greeted me with the cry:  \"Any news, sir? Heard if we are going to have a go at 'em with the spoons  (bayonets)?\" One midget, a bugler kiddie, so small that an ordinary  maid-of-all-work could comfortably lay him across her knee and spank him,  yawned as he knelt in the grass, and desired to know when \"we was goin' ter  'ave some real bloomin' fightin'. 'E was tired of them bloomin' guns, 'e  was; they made his carmine 'ead ache with their blanky noise. 'E didn't  call that fightin'; 'e called it an adjective waste of good hammunition. 'E  liked gettin' up to 'is man, fair 'nd square, 'nd knockin' 'ell out of  'im.\" He meant it, too, the little beggar, and I could not help laughing at  him when I considered that lots of the old fighting Boers I had seen could  have dropped the midget into their lunch bags, and not have noticed his  weight.    The Yeomanry did a lot of useful work, and are as eager for fight as a bull  ant on a hot plate. They are as good as any men I have seen in Africa, full  of ginger, good horsemen, wear-and-tear, cut-and-come-again sort of men.  They adapt themselves to circumstances readily, are jolly and good-humoured  under trying circumstances. Their officers are, as a rule, first-class  soldiers, equal to any emergency. On Tuesday the Boers kept their guns  going at a great rate, and we really thought that they had made up their  minds to see the thing right out at all costs. Personally I did not for a  moment think that they were ignorant of General French's rapid advance. I  do not believe it possible for any large body of hostile troops to move in  South Africa without the Boers being thoroughly cognisant of every detail  connected with the move, partly because they are the most perfect scouts in  the world, and partly because the scattered population on every hand is  positively favourable to them. Our artillery dropped a storm of shells  during the day, and that night it was whispered in camp that there was to  be a general attack next morning. On Tuesday evening General French  advanced right on to the Boer rear, and some smart fighting took place, the  enemy suffering considerably, though our losses were small.    At dawn on Wednesday we moved forward rapidly, and in a few hours' time our  infantry were standing in the trenches and upon the hills that the Boers  had occupied the day before. Our mounted men rode at a gallop through the  gullies, but nothing was to be seen of the foe except a few newly dug  graves. The Boers had vanished like a dream, taking all their guns with  them. Louis Botha, the commander-in-chief, had come in person to them, and  the retreat was carried out under his eyes. We followed to Dewetsdorp, and  from there on to Thaba Nchu (pronounced Tabancha).    On Friday night the enemy exchanged a few shots with us from the heights  beyond, but no harm was done on either side. The Third Division, to which I  had attached myself, under General Chermside, has been ordered towards  Bloemfontein. French is in command, and, judging by his past performances,  I fully expect we shall have some busy times, though French may go away and  leave the Eighth Division under General Rundle.                                 WITH RUNDLE IN THE FREE STATE.                                                             ORANGE FREE STATE.      Since the Boers bolted from Constantia Farm we have done but little beyond  following them from spot to spot through the Free State, in the conquered  territory along the Basuto border. At Constantia Farm they gave us a  gunnery duel, which, though incessant and continuous, did little real  damage to either side. After that, when General French joined issue with  us, the Boers shifted their ground with consummate skill. We moved on to  Dewetsdorp, and there the Third Division, under Chermside, parted company  with us. We moved onward to Thaba Nchu, Brabant keeping well away towards  the Basuto border with his flying column. At Thaba Nchu it looked day by  day as if we were in for something hot and hard, the Boers having, as  usual, taken up a position of vast natural strength. But Hamilton was the  only one to get to close quarters with the veldt warriors, when executing a  flanking movement. I have since learned that the enemy suffered very  severely on that occasion.    They can give some of the British journalists a wholesome lesson in regard  to manliness of spirit, these same rough fellows, bred in the African  wilds. Speaking to me of the charge the Gordons made, when led by Captain  Towse, they were unstinted in their praises. \"It was grand, it was  terrible,\" they said, \"to see that little handful of men rush on fearless  of death, fearless of everything.\" It was bravery of the highest kind, and  they admired it, as only brave men do admire courage in a foeman. The  people of Britain who read extracts taken from Boer newspapers, extracts  which ridicule British pluck and all things British, must not blame the  Boers for those statements. In nearly every case the papers published  inside Burgher territory are edited by renegade Britons, and it is these  renegades, not the fighting Boers, who defame our nation, and take every  possible opportunity of hitting below the belt.    When we left Thaba Nchu, General French left us, as did also Hamilton and  Smith-Dorien. Brabant hugged the Basuto border, and swept the land clean of  everything hostile. General Rundle (the flower of courtesy and chivalry)  kept the centre; General Boyes looked after our left wing; General Campbell  picked up the intermediate spaces as occasion demanded; and so we moved on,  trying, but trying in vain, to draw a cordon round the ever-shifting foe.  There was no chance for a dashing forward move; the country through which  we passed was lined by kopjes, which were simply appalling in their native  strength. What prompted the Boer leaders to fall back from them, step by  step, will for ever remain a mystery to me. It was not want of provisions,  for we knew that they had huge supplies of beef and mutton, whilst there  were in their possession almost inexhaustible stores of grain. It was not  want of fodder for their horses, for the valleys and veldt were covered  with beautiful grass, almost knee-deep. Water was plentiful in all  directions, and they apparently possessed plenty of ammunition. Prisoners  assert that Commandant Olivier was absolutely furious when compelled to  fall back, by order of his superiors. It is also asserted that he is now in  dire disgrace on account of his refusal to obey promptly some of his  superior's commands. It is further stated that he is to be deposed from his  command, and will cease to be a factor of any importance in the war. It is  hard to fathom Boer tactics. It does not follow because a line of kopjes  are abandoned to-day that the burghers have retreated; they fall back  before scouting parties; their pickets watch our scouts return to camp,  knowing that they will convey the news to headquarters that the kopjes are  empty of armed men. Then, with almost incredible swiftness, the light-armed  Boers swarm back by passes known only to themselves, and secretly and  silently take up positions where they can butcher an advancing army. If  General Rundle had been a rash, impetuous, or a headstrong man, he could  comfortably have lost his whole force on half a dozen occasions; but he is  not. He is essentially a cautious leader, and pits his brain against that  of the Boer leaders as a good chess player pits his against an opponent. He  may believe in the luck of the British Army, but he trusts mighty little to  it. Better lose a couple of days than a couple of regiments is his motto,  and a wise motto it is. Had he flung his men haphazard at any of the  positions where the Boers have made a stand, he would have been cut to  pieces."]]]
