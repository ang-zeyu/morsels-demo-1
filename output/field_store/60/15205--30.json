The 30th day being in latitude 18 degrees 21 minutes we made the land  again, and saw many great smokes near the shore; and having fair weather  and moderate breezes I steered in towards it. At 4 in the afternoon I  anchored in 8 fathom water, clear sand, about 3 leagues and a half from  the shore. I presently sent my boat to sound nearer in, and they found 10  fathom about a mile farther in; and from thence still farther in the  water decreased gradually to 9, 8, 7, and 2 mile distance to 6 fathom.  This evening we saw an eclipse of the moon, but it was abating before the  moon appeared to us; for the horizon was very hazy, so that we could not  see the moon till she had been half an hour above the horizon: and at 2  hours, 22 minutes after sunset, by the reckoning of our glasses, the  eclipse was quite gone, which was not of many digits. The moon's centre  was then 33 degrees 40 minutes high.    The 31st of August betimes in the morning I went ashore with 10 or 11 men  to search for water. We went armed with muskets and cutlasses for our  defence, expecting to see people there; and carried also shovels and  pickaxes to dig wells. When we came near the shore we saw 3 tall black  naked men on the sandy bay ahead of us: but as we rowed in they went  away. When we were landed I sent the boat with two men in her to lie a  little from the shore at an anchor, to prevent being seized; while the  rest of us went after the 3 black men, who were now got on the top of a  small hill about a quarter of a mile from us, with 8 or 9 men more in  their company. They seeing us coming ran away. When we came on the top of  the hill where they first stood we saw a plain savannah, about half a  mile from us, farther in from the sea. There were several things like  haycocks standing in the savannah; which at a distance we thought were  houses, looking just like the Hottentots' houses at the Cape of Good  Hope: but we found them to be so many rocks. We searched about these for  water, but could find none, nor any houses, nor people, for they were all  gone. Then we turned again to the place where we landed, and there we dug  for water.    While we were at work there came nine or 10 of the natives to a small  hill a little way from us, and stood there menacing and threatening of  us, and making a great noise. At last one of them came towards us, and  the rest followed at a distance. I went out to meet him, and came within  50 yards of him, making to him all the signs of peace and friendship I  could; but then he ran away, neither would they any of them stay for us  to come nigh them; for we tried two or three times. At last I took two  men with me, and went in the afternoon along by the seaside, purposely to  catch one of them, if I could, of whom I might learn where they got their  fresh water. There were 10 or 12 natives a little way off, who seeing us  three going away from the rest of our men, followed us at a distance. I  thought they would follow us: but there being for a while a sandbank  between us and them, that they could not then see us, we made a halt, and  hid ourselves in a bending of the sandbank. They knew we must be  thereabouts, and being 3 or 4 times our number, thought to seize us. So  they dispersed themselves, some going to the seashore and others beating  about the sandhills. We knew by what rencounter we had had with them in  the morning that we could easily outrun them; so a nimble young man that  was with me, seeing some of them near, ran towards them; and they for  some time ran away before him. But he soon overtaking them, they faced  about and fought him. He had a cutlass, and they had wooden lances; with  which, being many of them, they were too hard for him. When he first ran  towards them I chased two more that were by the shore; but fearing how it  might be with my young man, I turned back quickly, and went up to the top  of a sandhill, whence I saw him near me, closely engaged with them. Upon  their seeing me, one of them threw a lance at me, that narrowly missed  me. I discharged my gun to scare them but avoided shooting any of them;  till finding the young man in great danger from them, and myself in some;  and that though the gun had a little frighted them at first, yet they had  soon learnt to despise it, tossing up their hands, and crying pooh, pooh,  pooh; and coming on afresh with a great noise, I thought it high time to  charge again, and shoot one of them, which I did. The rest, seeing him  fall, made a stand again; and my young man took the opportunity to  disengage himself, and come off to me; my other man also was with me, who  had done nothing all this while, having come out unarmed; and I returned  back with my men, designing to attempt the natives no farther, being very  sorry for what had happened already. They took up their wounded  companion; and my young man, who had been struck through the cheek by one  of their lances, was afraid it had been poisoned: but I did not think  that likely. His wound was very painful to him, being made with a blunt  weapon: but he soon recovered of it.    Among the New Hollanders whom we were thus engaged with, there was one  who by his appearance and carriage, as well in the morning as this  afternoon, seemed to be the chief of them, and a kind of prince or  captain among them. He was a young brisk man, not very tall, nor so  personable as some of the rest, though more active and courageous: he was  painted (which none of the rest were at all) with a circle of white paste  or pigment (a sort of lime, as we thought) about his eyes, and a white  streak down his nose from his forehead to the tip of it. And his breast  and some part of his arms were also made white with the same paint; not  for beauty or ornament, one would think, but as some wild Indian warriors  are said to do, he seemed thereby to design the looking more terrible;  this his painting adding very much to his natural deformity; for they all  of them have the most unpleasant looks and the worst features of any  people that ever I saw, though I have seen great variety of savages.  These New Hollanders were probably the same sort of people as those I met  with on this coast in my Voyage round the World; for the place I then  touched at was not above 40 or 50 leagues to the north-east of this: and  these were much the same blinking creatures (here being also abundance of  the same kind of flesh-flies teasing them) and with the same black skins,  and hair frizzled, tall and thin, etc., as those were: but we had not the  opportunity to see whether these, as the former, wanted two of their  foreteeth.    We saw a great many places where they had made fires; and where there  were commonly 3 or 4 boughs stuck up to windward of them; for the wind  (which is the seabreeze) in the daytime blows always one way with them;  and the land breeze is but small. By their fireplaces we should always  find great heaps of fish-shells, of several sorts; and it is probable  that these poor creatures here lived chiefly on the shellfish, as those I  before described did on small fish, which they caught in wires or holes  in the sand at low-water. These gathered their shellfish on the rocks at  low-water; but had no wires (that we saw) whereby to get any other sorts  of fish: as among the former I saw not any heaps of shells as here,  though I know they also gathered some shellfish. The lances also of those  were such as these had; however they being upon an island, with their  women and children, and all in our power, they did not there use them  against us, as here on the continent, where we saw none but some of the  men under head, who come out purposely to observe us. We saw no houses at  either place; and I believe they have none, since the former people on  the island had none, though they had all their families with them.    Upon returning to my men I saw that though they had dug 8 or 9 foot deep  yet found no water. So I returned aboard that evening, and the next day  being September 1st I sent my boatswain ashore to dig deeper, and sent  the seine with him to catch fish. While I stayed aboard I observed the  flowing of the tide, which runs very swift here, so that our nun-buoy  would not bear above the water to be seen. It flows here (as on that part  of New Holland I described formerly) about 5 fathom: and here the flood  runs south-east by south till the last quarter; then it sets right in  towards the shore (which lies here south-south-west and north-north-east)  and the ebb runs north-west by north. When the tides slackened we fished  with hook and line, as we had already done in several places on this  coast; on which in this voyage hitherto we had found but little tides:  but by the height and strength and course of them hereabouts it should  seem that if there be such a passage or strait going through eastward to  the great South Sea, as I said one might suspect, one would expect to  find the mouth of it somewhere between this place and Rosemary Island,  which was the part of New Holland I came last from.    Next morning my men came aboard and brought a rundlet of brackish water  which they got out of another well that they dug in a place a mile off,  and about half as far from the shore; but this water was not fit to  drink. However we all concluded that it would serve to boil our oatmeal,  for burgoo, whereby we might save the remains of our other water for  drinking, till we should get more; and accordingly the next day we  brought aboard 4 hogsheads of it: but while we were at work about the  well we were sadly pestered with the flies, which were more troublesome  to us than the sun, though it shone clear and strong upon us all the  while, very hot. All this while we saw no more of the natives, but saw  some of the smokes of some of their fires at 2 or 3 miles distance.    The land hereabouts was much like the part of New "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#20)"],[1,"this was the fate of  persons, who had possessed a comfortable property in their native country.  Some of them found means to embark for France; but though it was the land  of their forefathers, it must have been a foreign land to them. Those, who  remained behind, always cherished a belief, that the king of France would  never make peace with England, till his poor Acadians were restored their  country and their homes.\"    \"And did he?\" inquired Clara.    \"Alas, my dear Clara,\" said Grandfather, \"it is improbable that the  slightest whisper of the woes of Acadia ever reached the ears of Louis the  Fifteenth. The exiles grew old in the British provinces, and never saw  Acadia again. Their descendants remain among us, to this day. They have  forgotten the language of their ancestors, and probably retain no  tradition of their misfortunes. But, methinks, if I were an American poet,  I would choose Acadia for the subject of my song.\"    Since Grandfather first spoke these words, the most famous of American  poets has drawn sweet tears from all of us, by his beautiful poem of  Evangeline.    And now, having thrown a gentle gloom around the Thanksgiving fire-side,  by a story that made the children feel the blessing of a secure and  peaceful hearth, Grandfather put off the other events of the Old French  War till the next evening.          Chapter X      In the twilight of the succeeding eve, when the red beams of the fire were  dancing upon the wall, the children besought Grandfather to tell them what  had next happened to the old chair.    \"Our chair,\" said Grandfather, \"stood all this time in the Province House.  But, Governor Shirley had seldom an opportunity to repose within its arms.  He was loading his troops through the forest, or sailing in a flat-boat on  Lake Ontario, or sleeping in his tent, while the awful cataract of Niagara  sent its roar through his dreams. At one period, in the early part of the  war, Shirley had the chief command of all the king's forces in America.\"    \"Did his young wife go with him to the war?\" asked Clara.    \"I rather imagine,\" replied Grandfather, \"that she remained in Boston.  This lady, I suppose, had our chair all to herself, and used to sit in it,  during those brief intervals when a young French woman can be quiet enough  to sit in a chair. The people of Massachusetts were never fond of Governor  Shirley's young French wife. They had a suspicion that she betrayed the  military plans of the English to the generals of the French armies.\"    \"And was it true?\" inquired Clara.    \"Probably not,\" said Grandfather. \"But the mere suspicion did Shirley a  great deal of harm. Partly, perhaps, for this reason, but much more on  account of his inefficiency as a general, he was deprived of his command,  in 1756, and recalled to England. He never afterwards made any figure in  public life.\"    As Grandfather's chair had no locomotive properties, and did not even run  on castors, it cannot be supposed to have marched in person to the Old  French War. But Grandfather delayed its momentous history, while he  touched briefly upon some of the bloody battles, sieges, and onslaughts,  the tidings of which kept continually coming to the ears of the old  inhabitants of Boston. The woods of the north were populous with fighting  men. All the Indian tribes uplifted their tomahawks, and took part either  with the French or English. The rattle of musketry and roar of cannon  disturbed the ancient quiet of the forest, and actually drove the bears  and other wild beasts to the more cultivated portion of the country in the  vicinity of the sea-ports. The children felt as if they were transported  back to those forgotten times, and that the couriers from the army, with  the news of a battle lost or won, might even now be heard galloping  through the streets. Grandfather told them about the battle of Lake  George, in 1755, when the gallant Colonel Williams, a Massachusetts  officer, was slain, with many of his countrymen. But General Johnson and  General Lyman, with their army, drove back the enemy, and mortally wounded  the French leader, who was called the Baron Dieskau. A gold watch,  pilfered from the poor Baron, is still in existence, and still marks each  moment of time, without complaining of weariness, although its hands have  been in motion ever since the hour of battle.    In the first years of the war, there were many disasters on the English  side. Among these was the loss of Fort Oswego, in 1756, and of Fort  William Henry, in the following year. But the greatest misfortune that  befell the English, during the whole war, was the repulse of General  Abercrombie, with his army, from the ramparts of Ticonderoga, in 1758. He  attempted to storm the walls; but a terrible conflict ensued, in which  more than two thousand Englishmen and New Englanders were killed or  wounded. The slain soldiers now lie buried around that ancient fortress.  When the plough passes over the soil, it turns up here and there a  mouldering bone.    Up to this period, none of the English generals had shown any military  talent. Shirley, the Earl of Loudon, and General Abercrombie, had each  held the chief command, at different times; but not one of them had won a  single important triumph for the British arms. This ill success was not  owing to the want of means; for, in 1758, General Abercrombie had fifty  thousand soldiers under his command. But the French general, the famous  Marquis de Montcalm, possessed a great genius for war, and had something  within him, that taught him how battles were to be won.    At length, in 1759, Sir Jeffrey Amherst was appointed commander-in-chief  of all the British forces in America. He was a man of ability, and a  skilful soldier. A plan was now formed for accomplishing that object,  which had so long been the darling wish of the New Englanders, and which  their fathers had so many times attempted. This was the conquest of  Canada.    Three separate armies were to enter Canada, from different quarters. One  of the three, commanded by General Prideaux, was to embark on Lake  Ontario, and proceed to Montreal. The second, at the head of which was Sir  Jeffrey Amherst himself, was destined to reach the River St. Lawrence, by  the way of Lake Champlain, and then go down the river to meet the third  army. This last, led by General Wolfe, was to enter the St. Lawrence from  the sea, and ascend the river to Quebec. It is to Wolfe and his army that  England owes one of the most splendid triumphs, ever written in her  history.    Grandfather described the siege of Quebec, and told how Wolfe led his  soldiers up a rugged and lofty precipice, that rose from the shore of the  river to the plain on which the city stood. This bold adventure was  achieved in the darkness of night. At day-break, tidings were carried to  the Marquis de Montcalm, that the English army was waiting to give him  battle on the plains of Abraham. This brave French general ordered his  drums to strike up, and immediately marched to encounter Wolfe.    He marched to his own death. The battle was the most fierce and terrible,  that had ever been fought in America. General Wolfe was at the head of his  soldiers, and while encouraging them onward, received a mortal wound. He  reclined against a stone, in the agonies of death; but it seemed as if his  spirit could not pass away, while the fight yet raged so doubtfully.  Suddenly, a shout came pealing across the battle-field--\"They flee! they  flee!\" and, for a moment, Wolfe lifted his languid head. \"Who flee?\" he  inquired. \"The French,\" replied an officer. \"Then I die satisfied!\" said  Wolfe, and expired in the arms of victory.    \"If ever a warrior's death were glorious, Wolfe's was so!\" said  Grandfather; and his eye kindled, though he was a man of peaceful  thoughts, and gentle spirit. \"His life-blood streamed to baptize the soil  which he had added to the dominion of Britain! His dying breath was  mingled with his army's shout of victory!\"    \"Oh, it was a good death to die!\" cried Charley, with glistening eyes.  \"Was it not a good death, Laurence?\"    Laurence made no reply; for his heart burned within him, as the picture of  Wolfe, dying on the blood-stained field of victory, arose to his  imagination; and yet, he had a deep inward consciousness, that, after all,  there was a truer glory than could thus be won.    \"There were other battles in Canada, after Wolfe's victory,\" resumed  Grandfather; \"but we may consider the Old French War as having terminated  with this great event. The treaty of peace, however, was not signed until  1763. The terms of the treaty were very disadvantageous to the French; for  all Canada, and all Acadia, and the island of Cape Breton, in short, all  the territories that France and England had been fighting about, for  nearly a hundred years--were surrendered to the English.\"    \"So, now, at last,\" said Laurence, \"New England had gained her wish.  Canada was taken!\"    \"And now there was nobody to fight with, but the Indians,\" said Charley.    Grandfather mentioned two other important events. The first was the great  fire of Boston, in 1700, when the glare from nearly three hundred  buildings, all in flames at once, shone through the windows of the  Province House, and threw a fierce lustre upon the gilded foliage and  lion's head of our old chair. The second event was the proclamation, in  the same year, of George the Third as king of Great Britain. The blast of  the trumpet sounded from the balcony of the Town House, and awoke the  echoes far and wide, as if to challenge all mankind to dispute King  George's title.    Seven times, as the successive monarchs of Britain ascended the throne,  the trumpet-peal of proclamation had been heard by those who sat in our  venerable chair. But, when the next king put on his father's crown, no  trumpet-peal proclaimed it to New England! Long before that day, America  had shaken off the"]]]
