MONDAY 4 OCTOBER 1802    Early in the morning of the 4th, we got under way, with the Lady Nelson  in company, to proceed on our voyage to Torres' Strait and the Gulph of  Carpentaria. The wind was at E. by N., and we kept close up to weather  the northern Percy Isles; for I had a desire to fall in with the reefs  laid down by Mr. Campbell, three-quarters of a degree to the eastward, in  latitude 211/2 deg.; and to ascertain their termination to the north-westward.    [EAST COAST. BARRIER REEFS.]    The tide prevented us from weathering the islands till three in the  afternoon; we then passed between No. 4 and some rocks lying two miles to  the north-east, with 33 fathoms water. During the night we tacked every  two hours, working to the eastward, in from 30 to 36 fathoms; and at  daylight [TUESDAY 5 OCTOBER 1802], my station on the eastern isle No. 4  bore N. 89 deg. W., four leagues. Nothing was seen in the offing, but in  stretching to the N. N. E, reefs were discovered from the mast head a  little before noon; and after the observation for the latitude was taken,  I set one bearing East to E. by S., two leagues, and another N. 14 deg. W. to  29 deg. E., four or five miles. Our situation was in 21 deg. 15 2/3' south, and  longitude from the bearing of the Pine Peak, 150 deg. 34' east.    These reefs were not exactly those seen by Mr. Campbell; but they are  probably not more than five or six leagues to the north-westward of them,  and form part of the same _barrier_ to the coast. In standing on between  the two reefs above set, others, or parts of the same, came in sight  ahead; upon which I shortened sail to the three top sails, desired the  Lady Nelson to take the lead, and bore away north-westward along the  inner side of the northern reef. In an hour we had passed its west end;  but another reef came in sight, and for a time obliged us to steer W. by  S. At four o'clock we ran northward again, following the direction of the  reef on its lee side; and at six anchored in 27 fathoms, coarse sand, in  the following situation:      Latitude observed from the moon.,         21 deg.  4' S.  Longitude from bearings,                 150  19  E.  Nearest part of the reef, dist. 21/2 miles,   E. 1/2  S.  A smaller reef, distant 3 miles,         N. W. 1/2  N.  Percy Isles, Pine Peak of No. 3,        S. 9   0  W.  Cumberland Island marked 'k',           W. 6   0  N.      The reefs were not dry in any part, with the exception of some small  black lumps, which at a distance resembled the round heads of negroes;  the sea broke upon the edges, but within side the water was smooth, and  of a light green colour. A further description of these dangers is  unnecessary, since their forms and relative positions, so far as they  could be ascertained, will be best learned from the chart.    Until midnight, five hours after the moon had passed the meridian, a tide  came from S. by E., half a mile per hour. The ship then tended to the N.  E. by E.; and this tide, whose rate was one mile, appearing to be the  flood, led me to suppose there might be an open sea in that direction. In  the morning [WEDNESDAY 6 OCTOBER 1802], I sent a boat to lieutenant  Murray with instructions for his guidance in case of separation; and  appointed him Murray's Islands in Torres' Strait, discovered by captain  Edwards in 1791, for the first rendezvous; cautioning him to be strictly  on his guard against the treachery of the natives.    We weighed at seven o'clock, and steered N. N. E., close to the wind; at  ten, reefs came in sight, extending from W. by N., to N. by E. 1/2 E.,  which we weathered one mile, having 35 fathoms water. Our situation at  noon was in latitude 20 deg. 45' 40\", from observations to the north and  south, and the longitude by time keeper 150 deg. 28'; the east end of the  great reef to leeward bore S. W. 1/2 W. two miles, and it extended in  patches to N. 16 deg. W., where, at the distance of two leagues, was either a  dry white sand or high breakers but which could not be discerned from the  reflection of the sun. Nothing was seen to the north-east, and we now lay  up in that direction; but at one o'clock there was a small reef bearing  N. 1/2 E.; and at three, a larger one extended from N. by W. 1/2 W. to E. N.  E., and on the outside of it were such high breakers, that nothing less  than the unobstructed waves of the ocean could produce them. We stood on  for this reef, until four; and being then one mile off, tacked to the  southward, having 33 fathoms, nearly the same depth as before.    The larbord tack was continued to six o'clock, at which time we anchored  in 32 fathoms, white sand, shells, and pieces of coral, having neither  reef nor danger of any kind in sight; but the smoothness of the water  left no doubt of many lying to windward. From the high breakers seen in  the afternoon, however, hopes were entertained of soon clearing the  reefs; for by this time I was weary of them, not only from the danger to  which the vessels were thereby exposed, but from fear of the contrary  monsoon setting in upon the North Coast, before we should get into the  Gulph of Carpentaria.    At this anchorage, the tide came from between S. W. by S. and W. by S.,  till midnight; and at two in the morning [THURSDAY 7 OCTOBER 1802] the  ship rode north, and afterwards N. E. by E., to the flood; which seemed  to imply two openings in the reefs, and one of them near the high  breakers. The depth of water changed from 35 to 32 fathoms, in the night;  but a part of the difference might arise from irregularities in the  bottom.    We got under way at daybreak, and stretched south-east to gain the wind;  at nine, a reef was passed on each beam; and at noon, when we tacked to  the northward in 20 deg. 58' south and 150 deg. 48' east, there were five others,  distant from two to five miles, bearing from S. 20 deg. W., round by the east  and north to N. 25 deg. W.; but apparently with passages between most of  them. Upon these reefs were more of the dry, black lumps, called negro  heads, than had been seen before; but they were so much alike as to be of  no use in distinguishing one reef from another; and at high water, nearly  the whole were covered.    In the afternoon, a very light wind at north-east left no prospect of  weathering the reef before dark, upon which the high breakers had been  seen; we therefore tacked to the E. S. E., and anchored at sunset in 84  fathoms, fine white sand, not far from our noon's situation; a reef,  partly dry, was then distant one mile and a half, and bore E. 1/2 S. to S.  E. The flood tide here ran something more than one mile an hour, and came  from between north and north-west, the ship tending to it at one in the  morning.    FRIDAY 8 OCTOBER 1802    At seven, when the flood had done running, the two vessels were lying up  E. N. E., with a light breeze from the northward; but a rippling which  extended a mile from the reef, caused us to tack until a boat was sent to  sound upon it; for the Lady Nelson was so leewardly, that much time was  lost in waiting for her. At ten we passed through the rippling, in from  14 to 34 fathoms; and at noon were in latitude 20 deg. 55', and longitude  150 deg. 55' by time keeper. We seemed at this time to be surrounded with  reefs; but it was ascertained by the whale boat, that many of these  appearances were caused by the shadows of clouds and the ripplings and  eddies of tide, and that the true coral banks were those only which had  either green water or negro heads upon them. Of these, however, there was  a formidable mass, all round ahead, with but one small channel through  them; and this I was resolved to attempt, in the hope of its carrying us  out to windward of the high breakers.    At two o'clock, the eastern reef, which was a mile distant to leeward and  nearly dry, was seen to terminate, whilst the northern reefs extended out  of sight to the north-east; the opening between them was a mile and a  half wide, and full of ripplings; but having the whale boat ahead, we  bore away E. S. E., to go through the least agitated part. Having little  wind, and a flood tide making against us, the boat was called back to  tow, and the brig directed to take its station by means of her sweeps.  Our soundings were irregular in the narrow part, between 24 and 9  fathoms, on rocky ground; but after getting through, we had from 30 to  32, the usual depth in the open places. At sunset, the stream anchor was  dropped on a bottom of coral sand and shells; the reefs then in sight  extending from about E. S. E., round by the north to N. W., where was the  great northern bank. Whether there were any passage through them, could  not be discerned; but the breakers on many of the outer parts proved the  open sea to be not far distant, and that the waves ran high; whilst  within side, the water was as tranquil as in harbour.    The ship rode north-west, till between eight and nine o'clock, when it  appeared to be high water, and the depth was 35 fathoms; at 9h 34' the  moon passed the meridian, and we were then riding S. by W., to a tide  which ran at the strongest one and a quarter mile per hour. Between three  and four in the morning [SATURDAY 9 OCTOBER 1802] this tide had done, the  depth was 31 fathoms, and the ship afterwards rode N. N. E. till  daylight. The first of the flood therefore came from the N. N. E. and the  latter part from N. W.; it was high water at _one hour before_ the moon's  passage, and the rise at least three fathoms, or eighteen feet. This time  of high water coincides with that of Broad Sound; but it is remarkable,  that at the Percy Isles, lying between them, it should be three hours  earlier. The rise in Broad Sound was five fathoms, and three, or more,  amongst the reefs; whereas at the Percy Isles, there was nothing on the  shore to indicate a higher tide than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#20)"],[1,"person,--I know this trial is in store for my  son,--remember the cause you are engaged in; suffer patiently; never draw  your sword against the people who profess the true faith, even though they  are but by name Mussulmauns.    'Against the enemies of God, I have already given you directions; you may  fight for Him--the only true God,--but never against Him, or His faithful  servants.'    When Mahumud was numbered with the dead, Omir soon set himself forward as  the lawful successor; he was of good address, and insinuating manners, and  succeeded in drawing 'numbers to his threshold'. He preached the same  doctrine Mahumud had taught, but sensual indulgence and early developed  ambition were more strong in his heart than the faith he preached. Omir  grew jealous of Ali's virtues and forbearance, under the various trials of  oppression and injustice he chose to visit him with; and resolved that, if  possible, he would destroy not only Ali, but his whole family. Omir caused  his house to be fired treacherously, but as the historians say, 'the mercy  of God watched over the sanctified family'; they escaped from the flames,  with no other loss than that of their small property.    The Khoraun was not the work of any particular period in the life of  Mahumud. It was not compiled into a book until after Mahumud's death, who  was totally unacquainted with letters; each chapter having been conveyed  by the angel Gabriel[12] to Mahumud, his inspired memory enabled him to  repeat, verbatim, the holy messenger's words to his disciples and converts  when assembled as was their daily custom. To as many as committed verse,  chapter, or portion to memory, by this oral communication, Mahumud  rewarded with the highest seats in his assembly (meaning nearest his  person); and to those who wished for employment, he gave the command of  detachments sent out against the infidels.    The whole Khoraun was thus conveyed to Mahumud by the angel Gabriel, at  many different periods of his mission; and by daily repetition, did he  instil into the memory of his followers that mental scripture. But when  Omir usurped the right to lead, he ambitiously planned for himself a large  share of popularity by causing the Khoraun to be committed to paper, and  he accordingly gave orders, that the best scribes should be employed to  convey its precepts to writing.    Ali had been engaged in the same employment for some time, perceiving the  future benefit to the faith which would accrue from such a labour, and on  the very day, when Omir was seated in form to receive the work of his  scribes, Ali also presented himself with his version of the Khoraun. It is  asserted that Omir treated him with some indignity, and gave the  preference to the volume his own scribes had prepared, desiring Ali,  nevertheless, to leave that he had transcribed with him, though he  candidly told him he never intended it should be 'the Book for the People'.  Ali found, on this trying occasion, the benefit of Mahumud's advice, to  keep his temper subdued for the trial, and withdrew with his book clasped  to his heart, assuring Omir, that the volume should only be the property  of his descendants; and that when the twelfth Emaum, prophesied by Mahumud,  should disappear from the eye of man, the Khoraun he had written should  also disappear, until that Emaum returned, with whom the book he had  written should again be found.    The name of Omir is detestable to all lovers of literature, or admirers of  ancient history and valuable records. By his orders, the bath was heated  with the valuable collection of manuscripts, which it had been the work of  ages to complete.[13] Omir was told that the people valued the writings of  the ancients, and that they were displeased at this irreparable  destruction of valuable records; he asked if the people were not satisfied  with the Khoraun? and if satisfied, why should they seek for other  knowledge than that book contained? declaring it to be an useless  employment of time, to be engaged in any other readings. They say the  collection of books thus destroyed was so vast, that it served the purpose,  to which it was applied, for many successive days. I have thus far given  the accounts I have received of the origin of the two sects amongst the  Mussulmauns from good authority. My husband says, that in Hindoostaun the  two sects may be nearly equal in number;[14] in Persia the Sheahs  certainly prevail; in Turkey all are Soonies; and in Arabia the Sheahs are  supposed to preponderate. On the whole, perhaps, the two sects are about  equally divided.    The Mussulmauns' Creed, of the Sheah sect, is as follows:--    'I believe in one God, supreme over all, and Him alone do I worship.    'I believe that Mahumud was the creature of God, the Creator; I believe  that Mahumud was the messenger of God, (the Lord of messengers); and that  he was the last of the prophets. I believe that Ali was the chief of the  faithful, the head of all the inheritors of the law, and the true leader  appointed of God; consequently to be obeyed by the faithful. Also I  believe that Hasan and Hosein, the sons of Ali, and Ali son of Hosein, and  Mahumud son of Ali, and Jaufur son of Mahumud, and Moosa son of Jaufur,  and Ali son of Moosa, and Mahumud son of Ali, and Ali son of Mahumud, and  Hasan son of Ali, and Mhidhie (the standing proof) son of Hasan; the mercy  of God be upon them! these were the true leaders of the faithful, and the  proof of God was conveyed by them to the people.'[15]    This creed is taught to the children of both sexes, in Mussulmaun families,  as soon as they are able to talk; and, from the daily repetition, is  perfectly familiar to them at an early age.    I propose describing the funeral service here, as the substance of their  particular faith is so intimately connected with the appointed service for  the dead.    The dead body of a Mussulmaun, in about six hours after life is extinct,  is placed in a kuffin[16] (coffin) and conveyed to the place of burial,  with parade suited to the rank he held in life.    A tent, or the kaanaut[17] (screen), is pitched in a convenient place,  where water is available near to the tomb, for the purpose of washing and  preparing the dead body for interment. They then take the corpse out of  the coffin and thoroughly bathe it; when dry, they rub pounded camphor on  the hands, feet, knees, and forehead, these parts having, in the method of  prostrating at prayer, daily touched the ground; the body is then wrapped  neatly in a winding-sheet of white calico, on which has been written  particular chapters from the Khoraun:[18] this done, it is taken up with  great gentleness and laid in the grave on the side, with the face towards  Mecca. The officiating Maulvee steps solemnly into the grave (which is  much deeper and wider than ours), and with a loud voice repeats the creed,  as before described; after which he says, 'These were thy good and holy  leaders, O son of Adam! (here he repeats the person's names). Now when the  two angels come unto thee, who are the Maccurrub[19] (messengers) from thy  great and mighty God, they will ask of thee, \"Who is thy Lord? Who is thy  Prophet? What is thy faith? Which is thy book? Where is thy Kiblaah?[20]  Who is thy Leader?\"    'Then shalt thou answer the Maccurrub thus:--      '\"God, greatest in glory, is my only Lord; Mahumud, my Prophet; Islaaim,    my faith, (Islaaim means true faith); the Khoraun, my book; the Kaubah    (Holy House at Mecca), my Kiblaah;      '\"Emaum Ali, son of Aboutalib,      \"   Hasan and Hosein,      \"   Ali, surnamed Zynool Auberdene,      \"   Mahumud,  \"   Baakur,      \"   Jaufur,   \"   Saadick,      \"   Moosa,    \"   Khazim,      \"   Ali,      \"   Reezah,      \"   Mahumud,  \"   Ul Jawaad,      \"   Ali,      \"   Ul Hoodah,      \"   Hasan,    \"   Ul Ushkeree,      \"   Mhidhie, the standing proof that we are waiting for.[21]      '\"These are all my leaders, and they are my intercessors, with them is my    love, with their enemies is my hatred, in the world of earth and in the    world to come eternal.\"'    Then the Maulvee says:--    'Know ye for a truth, O man (repeating his name), that the God we worship  is One only, Great and Glorious, Most High and Mighty God, who is above  all lords, the only true God.    'Know ye also, That Mahumud is the best of the Lord's messengers.    'That Ali and his successors (before enumerated, but always here repeated)  were the best of all leaders.    'That whatever came with Mahumud is true, (meaning the whole work of his  mission);--Death is true; the Interrogation by Moonkih and Nykee[22] (the  two angels) is true; the Resurrection is true; Destruction is true; the  Bridge of Sirraat[23] is true; the Scales are true; Looking into the Book  is true; Heaven and Earth are true; Hell is true; the Day of Judgment is  true.    'Of these things there is no doubt--all are true; and, further, that God,  the great and glorious God, will raise all the dead bodies from their  graves.'    Then the Maulvee reads the following prayer or benediction, which is  called Dooar[24] prayer:--    'May the Lord God, abundant in mercy, keep you with the true speech; may  He lead you to the perfect path; may He grant you knowledge of Him, and of  His prophets.    'May the mercy of God be fixed upon you for ever. Ameen.'    This concluded, the Maulvee quits the grave, and slowly moves forty  measured paces in a line with it; then turning round, he comes again to  the grave, with the same solemnity in his steps, and standing on the edge,  he prays,    'O great and glorious God, we beseech Thee with humility make the earth  comfortable to this Thy servant's side, and raise his soul to Thee, and  with Thee may he find mercy and forgiveness.'    'Ameen, Ameen,' is responded by all present.    This ends the funeral service: the earth is closed over by the servants,  &c. and, except with the very poor, the grave is never"]]]
