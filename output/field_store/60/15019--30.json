The renderings of the words for certain sins are not always  definite or exact, because we do not know the precise idea which the  framer of this remarkable document had. The deceased states that he has  neither cursed God, nor thought scorn of the god of his city, nor cursed  the king, nor committed theft of any kind, nor murder, nor adultery, nor  sodomy, nor crimes against the god of generation; he has not been  imperious or haughty, or violent, or wrathful, or hasty in deed, or a  hypocrite, or an accepter of persons, or a blasphemer, or crafty, or  avaricious, or fraudulent, or deaf to pious words, or a party to evil  actions, or proud, or puffed up; he has terrified no man, he has not  cheated in the market-place, and he has neither fouled the public  watercourse nor laid waste the tilled land of the community. This is, in  brief, the confession which the deceased makes; and the next act in the  Judgment Scene is weighing the heart of the deceased in the scales. As  none of the oldest papyri of the Book of the Dead supplies us with a  representation of this scene, we must have recourse to the best of the  illustrated papyri of the latter half of the XVIIIth and of the XIXth  dynasties. The details of the Judgment Scene vary greatly in various  papyri, but the essential parts of it are always preserved. The  following is the description of the judgment of Ani, as it appears in  his wonderful papyrus preserved in the British Museum.    In the underworld, and in that portion of it which is called the Hall of  Ma[=a]ti, is set a balance wherein the heart of the deceased is to be  weighed. The beam is suspended by a ring upon a projection from the  standard of the balance made in the form of the feather which is the  symbol of Ma[=a]t, or what is right and true. The tongue of the balance  is fixed to the beam, and when this is exactly level, the tongue is as  straight as the standard; if either end of the beam inclines downwards  the tongue cannot remain in a perpendicular position. It must be  distinctly understood that the heart which was weighed in the one scale  was not expected to make the weight which was in the other to kick the  beam, for all that was asked or required of the deceased was that his  heart should balance exactly the symbol of the law. The standard was  sometimes surmounted by a human head wearing the feather of Ma[=a]t;  sometimes by the head of a jackal, the animal sacred to Anubis; and  sometimes by the head of an ibis, the bird sacred to Thoth; in the  Papyrus of Ani a dog-headed ape, the associate of Thoth, sits on the top  of the standard. In some papyri (_e.g._, those of Ani [Footnote: About  B.C. 1500.] and Hunefer [Footnote: About B.C. 1370.]), in addition to  Osiris, the king of the underworld and judge of the dead, the gods of  his cycle or company appear as witnesses of the judgment. In the Papyrus  of the priestess Anhai [Footnote: About B.C. 1000.] in the British  Museum the great and the little companies of the gods appear as  witnesses, but the artist was so careless that instead of nine gods in  each group he painted six in one and five in the other. In the Turin  papyrus [Footnote: Written in the Ptolemaic period.] we see the whole of  the forty-two gods, to whom the deceased recited the [Illustration: The  weighing of the heart of the scribe Ani in the Balance in the presence  of the gods.] \"Negative Confession,\" seated in the judgment-hall. The  gods present at the weighing of Ani's heart are--      1. R[=A]-HARMACHIS, hawk-headed, the Sun-god of the dawn and of noon.      2. TEMU, the Sun-god of the evening, the great god of Heliopolis. He    is depicted always in human form and with the face of a man, a fact    which proves that he had at a very early period passed through all the    forms in which gods are represented, and had arrived at that of a man.    He has upon his head the crowns of the South and North.      3. SHU, man-headed, the son of R[=a] and Hathor, the personification    of the sunlight.      4. TEFNUT, lion-headed, the twin-sister of Shu, the personification of    moisture.      5. SEB, man-headed, the son of Shu, the personification of the earth.      6. NUT, woman-headed, the female counterpart of the gods Nu and Seb;    she was the personification of the primeval water, and later of the    sky.      7. ISIS, woman-headed, the sister-wife of Osiris, and mother of Horus.      8. NEPHTHYS, woman-headed, the sister-wife of Osiris, and mother of    Anubis.      9. HORUS, the \"great god,\" hawk-headed, whose worship was probably the    oldest in Egypt.      10. HATHOR, woman-headed, the personification of that portion of the    sky where the sun rose and set.      11. HU, man-headed, and      12. SA, also man-headed; these gods are present in the boat of R[=a]    in the scenes which depict the creation.    On one side of the balance kneels the god Anubis, jackal-headed, who  holds the weight of the tongue of the balance in his right hand, and  behind him stands Thoth, the scribe of the gods, ibis-headed, holding in  his hands a reed wherewith to write down the result of the weighing.  Near him is seated the tri-formed beast [=A]m-mit, the, \"Eater of the  Dead,\" who waits to devour the heart of Ani should it be found to be  light. In the Papyrus of Neb-qet at Paris this beast is seen lying by  the side of a lake of fire, at each corner of which is seated a  dog-headed ape; this lake is also seen in Chapter CXXVI. of the Book of  the Dead. The gods who are seated before a table of offerings, and  Anubis, and Thoth, and [=A]m-mit, are the beings who conduct the case,  so to speak, against Ani. On the other side of the balance stand Ani and  his wife Thuthu with their heads reverently bent; they are depicted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11323"],[0,"Caleb Williams; Or, Things as They Are (#20)"],[1,"  I shall immediately have occasion to introduce. Mr. Falkland's  compassion had already been strongly excited in favour of Hawkins; he  had in vain endeavoured to find him, and do him good; and he easily  conceived that, if the conjecture which had been made in this instance  proved true, he might have it in his power not only to do what he had  always intended, but further, to save from a perilous offence against  the laws and society a man who appeared to have strongly imbibed the  principles of justice and virtue. He took with him two servants,  because, going with the express design of encountering robbers, if  robbers should be found, he believed he should be inexcusable if he did  not go provided against possible accidents. But he had directed them, at  the same time that they kept within call, to be out of the reach of  being seen; and it was only the eagerness of their zeal that had brought  them up thus early in the present encounter.    This new adventure promised something extraordinary. Mr. Falkland did  not immediately recognise Miss Melville; and the person of Grimes was  that of a total stranger, whom he did not recollect to have ever seen.  But it was easy to understand the merits of the case, and the propriety  of interfering. The resolute manner of Mr. Falkland, conjoined with the  dread which Grimes, oppressed with a sense of wrong, entertained of the  opposition of so elevated a personage, speedily put the ravisher to  flight. Emily was left alone with her deliverer. He found her much more  collected and calm, than could reasonably have been expected from a  person who had been, a moment before, in the most alarming situation.  She told him of the place to which she desired to be conveyed, and he  immediately undertook to escort her. As they went along, she recovered  that state of mind which inclined her to make a person to whom she had  such repeated obligations, and who was so eminently the object of her  admiration, acquainted with the events that had recently befallen her.  Mr. Falkland listened with eagerness and surprise. Though he had already  known various instances of Mr. Tyrrel's mean jealousy and unfeeling  tyranny, this surpassed them all; and he could scarcely credit his ears  while he heard the tale. His brutal neighbour seemed to realise all that  has been told of the passions of fiends. Miss Melville was obliged to  repeat, in the course of her tale, her kinsman's rude accusation against  her, of entertaining a passion for Mr. Falkland; and this she did with  the most bewitching simplicity and charming confusion. Though this part  of the tale was a source of real pain to her deliverer, yet it is not to  be supposed but that the flattering partiality of this unhappy girl  increased the interest he felt in her welfare, and the indignation he  conceived against her infernal kinsman.    They arrived without accident at the house of the good lady under whose  protection Emily desired to place herself. Here Mr. Falkland willingly  left her as in a place of security. Such conspiracies as that of which  she was intended to have been the victim, depend for their success upon  the person against whom they are formed being out of the reach of help;  and the moment they are detected, they are annihilated. Such reasoning  will, no doubt, be generally found sufficiently solid; and it appeared  to Mr. Falkland perfectly applicable to the present case. But he was  mistaken.          CHAPTER IX.      Mr. Falkland had experienced the nullity of all expostulation with Mr.  Tyrrel, and was therefore content in the present case with confining his  attention to the intended victim. The indignation with which he thought  of his neighbour's character was now grown to such a height, as to fill  him with reluctance to the idea of a voluntary interview. There was  indeed another affair which had been contemporary with this, that had  once more brought these mortal enemies into a state of contest, and had  contributed to raise into a temper little short of madness, the already  inflamed and corrosive bitterness of Mr. Tyrrel.    There was a tenant of Mr. Tyrrel, one Hawkins;--I cannot mention his  name without recollecting the painful tragedies that are annexed to it!  This Hawkins had originally been taken up by Mr. Tyrrel, with a view of  protecting him from the arbitrary proceedings of a neighbouring squire,  though he had now in his turn become an object of persecution to Mr.  Tyrrel himself. The first ground of their connection was this:--Hawkins,  beside a farm which he rented under the above-mentioned squire, had a  small freehold estate that he inherited from his father. This of course  entitled him to a vote in the county elections; and, a warmly contested  election having occurred, he was required by his landlord to vote for  the candidate in whose favour he had himself engaged. Hawkins refused  to obey the mandate, and soon after received notice to quit the farm he  at that time rented.    It happened that Mr. Tyrrel had interested himself strongly in behalf of  the opposite candidate; and, as Mr. Tyrrel's estate bordered upon the  seat of Hawkins's present residence, the ejected countryman could think  of no better expedient than that of riding over to this gentleman's  mansion, and relating the case to him. Mr. Tyrrel heard him through with  attention. \"Well, friend,\" said he, \"it is very true that I wished Mr.  Jackman to carry his election; but you know it is usual in these cases  for tenants to vote just as their landlords please. I do not think  proper to encourage rebellion.\"--\"All that is very right, and please  you,\" replied Hawkins, \"and I would have voted at my landlord's bidding  for any other man in the kingdom but Squire Marlow. You must know one  day his huntsman rode over my fence, and so through my best field of  standing corn. It was not above a dozen yards about if he had kept the  cart-road. The fellow had served me the same sauce, an it please your  honour, three or four times before. So I only asked him what he did that  for, and whether he had not more conscience than to spoil people's crops  o' that fashion? Presently the squire came up. He is but a poor,  weazen-face chicken of a gentleman, saving your honour's reverence. And  so he flew into a woundy passion, and threatened to horsewhip me. I will  do as much in reason to pleasure my landlord as arr a tenant he has; but  I will not give my vote to a man that threatens to horsewhip me. And so,  your honour, I and my wife and three children are to be turned out of  house and home, and what I am to do to maintain them God knows. I have  been a hard-working man, and have always lived well, and I do think the  case is main hard. Squire Underwood turns me out of my farm; and if your  honour do not take me in, I know none of the neighbouring gentry will,  for fear, as they say, of encouraging their own tenants to run rusty  too.\"    This representation was not without its effect upon Mr. Tyrrel. \"Well,  well, man,\" replied he, \"we will see what can be done. Order and  subordination are very good things; but people should know how much to  require. As you tell the story, I cannot see that you are greatly to  blame. Marlow is a coxcombical prig, that is the truth on't; and if a  man will expose himself, why, he must even take what follows. I do hate  a Frenchified fop with all my soul: and I cannot say that I am much  pleased with my neighbour Underwood for taking the part of such a  rascal. Hawkins, I think, is your name? You may call on Barnes, my  steward, to-morrow, and he shall speak to you.\"    While Mr. Tyrrel was speaking, he recollected that he had a farm vacant,  of nearly the same value as that which Hawkins at present rented under  Mr. Underwood. He immediately consulted his steward, and, finding the  thing suitable in every respect, Hawkins was installed out of hand in  the catalogue of Mr. Tyrrel's tenants. Mr. Underwood extremely resented  this proceeding, which indeed, as being contrary to the understood  conventions of the country gentlemen, few people but Mr. Tyrrel would  have ventured upon. There was an end, said Mr. Underwood, to all  regulation, if tenants were to be encouraged in such disobedience. It  was not a question of this or that candidate, seeing that any gentleman,  who was a true friend to his country, would rather lose his election  than do a thing which, if once established into a practice, would  deprive them for ever of the power of managing any election. The  labouring people were sturdy and resolute enough of their own accord; it  became every day more difficult to keep them under any subordination;  and, if the gentlemen were so ill advised as to neglect the public good,  and encourage them in their insolence, there was no foreseeing where it  would end.    Mr. Tyrrel was not of a stamp to be influenced by these remonstrances.  Their general spirit was sufficiently conformable to the sentiments he  himself entertained; but he was of too vehement a temper to maintain the  character of a consistent politician; and, however wrong his conduct  might be, he would by no means admit of its being set right by the  suggestions of others. The more his patronage of Hawkins was criticised,  the more inflexibly he adhered to it; and he was at no loss in clubs and  other assemblies to overbear and silence, if not to confute, his  censurers. Beside which, Hawkins had certain accomplishments which  qualified him to be a favourite with Mr. Tyrrel. The bluntness of his  manner and the ruggedness of his temper gave him some resemblance to his  landord; and, as these qualities were likely to be more frequently  exercised on such persons as had incurred Mr. Tyrrel's displeasure, than  upon Mr. Tyrrel himself, they were not observed without some degree of  complacency. In a word, he every day received new marks of distinction  from his patron, and after some time was appointed coadjutor to Mr."]]]
