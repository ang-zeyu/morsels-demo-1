The head sprang up and went to the breast of  Aponibolinayen, and Aponibolinayen and Kanag and Alama-an ran away,  and their clothes were torn, for they ran through many thorns.    Not long after the people who went to attend the _Sayang_ went  home, and Aponibolinayen and Kanag and Alama-an arrived in a level  plain. They went to the shade of an _alosip_ [185] tree and they sat  there many days, for they were very tired. \"I am anxious to drink  water,\" said Aponibolinayen, and not long after they heard a rooster  crowing. \"I think we are near a town, for I hear a rooster crowing.\" So  they went where they had heard the rooster. \"We go and drink,\" said  Aponibolinayen. Not long after they reached the place where _Silit_  (one kind of lightning) and the dog _Kimat_ [186] guarded. _Silit_ and  the dog were sleeping and did not see them go inside of the town. Soon  they arrived in the yard of the golden house of Balbalaoga of Dona and  they were ashamed to ask for water to drink, for they were naked. So  they went to the _balaua_ and slept, for they were tired.    While they were sleeping, Balbalaoga saw them in his _balaua_, and  he was surprised, because no one was permitted to enter the town,  for _Silit_ and the dog prevented. He said, \"What is the matter of the  guards that they did not see those people enter the town? Perhaps they  are my relatives.\" So he took some clothes to the _balaua_ for them. He  covered them with blankets while they slept. As soon as he covered  them he sat down in the _balaua_ and waited until they got up. As soon  as Aponibolinayen awoke she saw him and said, \"Do not wound us in  many places, so we will not need to cure so much.\" Balbalaoga said,  \"If I were an enemy I would have killed you while you slept. We are  going to chew betel-nut and see who you are.\" So he cut a betel-nut  and gave to them, and their spittle was like agate beads. So he took  them up into his golden house and told his mother _alan_ to give them  some clothes. Not long after they drank _basi_, after they had finished  eating. All the _alan_ were drunk and the mother of Balbalaoga of Dona  said to them, \"Aponibolinayen, Balbalaoga is your brother, for he was  the after-birth of Awig, which they put in the _tabalang_ which they  sent down the stream. [187] So I picked him up, for I had no child  to inherit all my things.\" Not long after they knew that they were  brother and sister Balbalaoga asked his sister why they came to Dona  without clothes. She said, \"Aponitolau is jealous of Don Carlos and  he cut off his head, and the head jumped to my breasts, so we were  frightened and ran away. That is why we came here. I did not know I  had a brother who lived here.\" The head still hung to the breasts of  Aponibolinayen, but they had not seen it before, for she had covered  it. As soon as she showed it to Balbalaoga he took the head from her  breasts and they sent some betel-nuts to go and summon their mother.    As soon as the betel-nut arrived in Kaodanan it said to Pagbokasan  and Ebang, \"Good morning. I came here for Balbalaoga, and his sister  sent me to come and get you.\" So Ebang and Pagbokasan were surprised,  because Aponibolinayen had another brother. So they called Awig and  said to him, \"Here is a betel-nut from Dona which Aponibolinayen  and Balbalaoga sent, for they want to see us.\" Awig said to them, \"I  don't believe that Aponibolinayen is still alive, for we have searched  for her a very long time, and I never heard of a place called Dona,  and I have been all over the world.\"    They started and the betel-nut led them. \"Where is Dona?\" they said  to the betel-nut. \"Dona is somewhere. Follow me. You must step on the  big dishes where I step.\" Not long after they arrived in the place  where Balbalaoga lived and were surprised at the big golden house,  and Balbalaoga and Aponibolinayen were watching them from the window,  and they went to the yard of the house. Ebang and Pagbokasan did not  believe that Balbalaoga was their son, so they chewed betel-nut. As  soon as they chewed they found out that he was the after-birth of  Awig. So Balbalaoga took them into his house.    Not long after Balbalaoga said to them, \"Wait for me for awhile,  for I am going to hunt deer.\" So he called his dogs who talked with  the thunder, they were so big and also powerful. Not long after he  went to the wood and the dogs caught three deer. He cut up the deer  and took them back home.    Not long after Aponitolau heard that Aponibolinayen was with her  brother in Dona. He went to follow her, for he intended to live with  her again. Ebang and Pagbokasan took Balbalaoga and Aponibolinayen  to Kaodanan, and they used their power so that all the things which  the _alan_ had given to Balbalaoga went to Kaodanan. Not long after  the house and the other things which the _alan_ had given went to  Kaodanan, all the _alan_ flew away. Not long after they made _balaua_  in Kaodanan, and they called all their relatives in the other towns  and all of the _alan_ who cared for Balbalaoga of Dona. After that all  the people went to attend their _balaua_. In that time Balbalaoga was  married and Aponitolau was very sorry, because he could not remarry  Aponibolinayen, and he went to the _balaua_ even though he was not  invited. As soon as the _balaua_ was over, all the people went back  home, but Balbalaoga did not go back to Dona. The _alan_ flew away  after he was married.    (Told by Magwati of Lagangilang).            9    Ayo went to the spring. When she went she met Dagdagalisit, who was  fishing in the river. When she reached him she became pregnant. Not  long after she went home. When she arrived in her house the space  between the little finger and the next itched. \"Bolinayen, you stick  the needle in my finger where it itches. I do not know what makes it  itch so,\" she said. As soon as Bolinayen stuck the needle the little  baby popped out. [188] \"What shall we name the baby?\" \"Dagolayan will  be his name.\" The baby shook his head, so they gave him the name Kanag.    Awig went to wash his hair in the spring. When he finished washing  his hair he went home. When he reached his house he made Ayo louse  him. While Ayo was lousing him the milk from her breasts dropped  on Awig's legs. \"Why, Ayo, does the milk from your breasts drop on  my legs?\" he asked. He sat up and asked them many times until they  brought the baby. When they brought the baby, \"We are going home to  Natpangan now, because it does not do me any good to try and hide  you.\" He took them home and soon he made a bamboo bench by the gate  of the town where the people passed when they went to the well, and  he placed the baby on it. Then they built _balaua_, for he wanted to  see the father of the baby. Not long after he commanded some one to go  and get betel-nuts and he oiled them. He sent them to go and invite  all the people in the world. When they arrived none of them wanted  the baby to recognize them. When the baby did not go to any of them,  he sent someone to get a betel-nut to send to Dagdagalisit whom they  had not invited. As soon as the betel-nut arrived at the place where  Dagdagalisit lived \"Dagdagalisit came to Natpangan for Awig makes  _balaua_,\" it said. \"I cannot go, for I am ashamed, because I have no  good clothes,\" he said, for his clout was the dried bark of a banana  tree. \"If you do not come I will grow on your big pig,\" it said,  and the betel-nut jumped on the back of the big pig, and it began  to squeal. When his big pig began squealing loudly, because the tree  grew on his back, Dagdagalisit said, \"I come now.\" Not long after he  went. When he came walking up the trail from the spring the baby saw  him, and went to him, and Awig saw him carrying the baby. \"I did not  think it would happen this way to Aponibolinayen,\" he said. Then he  sent Aponibolinayen away, and he made her carry the poor house box  that they used to put the fish in which Dagdagalisit caught in the  river. \"You carry the female pig so that you have something to eat by  the river,\" said Awig to Dagdagalisit. So they went; Aponibolinayen  carried the poor box and Awig took her beads and clothes off from her,  and he gave her old clothes to use, and so they went.    When they were near the spring they threw away the things they carried,  the female pig and poor box. While they were walking near the town of  Dagdagalisit, which was Kabenbenlan, Ayo saw the golden house. \"We must  not walk by the side of the golden house, for I am ashamed before the  man who owns it,\" said Ayo to Dagdagalisit. They were still walking and  Ayo followed him. As soon as they arrived at the ladder Dagdagalisit  went upstairs and Ayo did not because she thought that Dagdagalisit did  not own that house, and Dagdagalisit made her go up, and she did. As  soon as she arrived above Dagdagalisit went to get rice to give Ayo  to cook. \"Cook this, Ayo, while I go to catch fish for us to eat,\"  he said, and he went. As soon as he caught two fish he went home,  and he left the dry bark of the banana, which he used as a clout,  by the river, and he became Ligi, [189] so he went home. As soon as  he arrived he made Ayo wake up, when he finished cooking the fish,  and the baby went to him to be carried. He called Ayo and she did  not go. \"I wait for my husband, we will both eat at one time, bye  and bye,\" she said, and she took the baby which he carried, for  she was ashamed. \"No, I was Dagdagalisit, but used the bark of the  banana tree for a clout, because I changed my form. Let us eat.\" So  they ate. As soon as they finished eating, \"We shall make _balaua_  so that we invite all our relatives in the different towns, and we  also shall invite Awig and Aponigonay,\" he said. Not long after he  went and took the betel-nuts which he cut. When he had cut them all  he oiled them and sent them to the different towns.    When the people from the different towns arrived by the spring in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],[0,"A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#20)"],[1,"the rocky walls rise  like terraces, speaks of eventful times long gone by.    An uninterrupted ride of five hours over very bad roads, from the  entrance of the mountain-range, added to the extreme heat and total  want of proper refreshment, suddenly brought on such a violent  giddiness that I could scarcely keep myself from falling off my  horse.  Although we had been on horseback for eleven hours since  leaving Joppa, I was so much afraid that Mr. B. would consider me  weak and ailing, and perhaps change his intention of accompanying me  from Jerusalem back to Joppa, that I refrained from acquainting him  with the condition in which I felt myself.  I therefore dismounted  (had I not done so, I should soon have fallen down), and walked with  tottering steps beside my horse, until I felt so far recovered that  I could mount once more.  Mr. B. had determined to perform the  distance from Joppa to Jerusalem (a sixteen hours' ride) at one  stretch.  He indeed asked me if I could bear so much fatigue; but I  was unwilling to abuse his kindness, and therefore assured him that  I could manage to ride on for five or six hours longer.  Fortunately  for my reputation, my companion was soon afterwards attacked with  the same symptoms that troubled me so much; he now began to think  that it might, after all, be advisable to rest for a few hours in  the next village, especially as we could not hope in any case to  reach the gates of Jerusalem before sundown.  I felt silently  thankful for this opportune occurrence, and left the question of  going on or stopping altogether to the decision of my fellow-  traveller, particularly as I knew the course he would choose.  Thus  I accomplished my object without being obliged to confess my  weakness.  In pursuance of this resolve, we stayed in the  neighbouring village of \"Kariet el Areb,\" the ancient Emmaus, where  the risen Saviour met the disciples, and where we find a ruin of a  Christian church in a tolerable state of preservation.  The building  is now used as a stable.  Some years ago this was the haunt of a  famous robber, who was scheikh of the place, and let no Frank pass  before he had paid whatever tribute he chose to demand.  Since the  accession of Mehemet Ali these exactions have ceased both here and  in Jerusalem, where money was demanded of the stranger for admission  into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other sacred places.  Even  highway robberies, which were once on a time of daily occurrence  among these mountains, are now rarely heard of.    We took possession of the entrance-hall of a mosque, near which a  delicious spring sparkled forth from a grotto.  Seldom has any thing  strengthened and refreshed me so much as the water of this spring.  I recovered completely from my indisposition, and was able to enjoy  the beautiful evening.    As soon as the scheikh of the village heard that a party of Franks  had arrived, he despatched four or five dishes of provisions to us.  Of all these preparations we could only eat one--the butter-milk.  The other dishes, a mixture of honey, cucumbers, hard-boiled eggs,  onions, oil, olives, etc., we generously bestowed upon the dragoman  and the muker, who caused them quickly to disappear.  An hour  afterwards the scheikh came in person to pay his respects.  We  reclined on the steps of the hall; and while the men smoked and  drank coffee, a conversation of a very uninteresting kind was kept  up, the dragoman acting as interpreter.  At length the scheikh  seemed seized with the idea that we might possibly be tired with our  journey.  He took his leave, and offered unasked to send us two men  as sentries, which he did.  Thus we could go to rest in perfect  safety under the open sky in the midst of a Turkish village.    But before we retired to rest, my companion was seized with the  rather original idea that we should pursue our journey at midnight.  He asked me, indeed, if I was afraid, but at the same time observed,  that it would be much safer for us to act upon his suggestion, as no  one would suspect our departure by such a dangerous road at  midnight.  I certainly felt a little afraid, but my pride would not  allow me to confess the truth; so our people received the order to  be prepared to set out at midnight.    Thus we four persons, alone and totally unarmed, travelled at  midnight through the wildest and most dangerous regions.  Fortunately the bright moon looked smilingly down upon us, and  illuminated our path so brightly, that the horses carried us with  firm step over every obstruction.  I was, I must confess, grievously  frightened by the shadows!  I saw living things moving to and fro--  forms gigantic and forms dwarfish seemed sometimes approaching us,  sometimes hiding behind masses of rock, or sinking back into  nothingness.  Lights and shadows, fears and anxiety, thus took  alternate possession of my imagination.    A couple of miles from our starting-place we came upon a brook  crossed by a narrow stone bridge.  This brook is remarkable only as  having been that from which David collected the five stones  wherewith he slew the Philistine giant.  At the season of my visit  there was no water to be seen; the bed of the stream was completely  dry.    About an hour's journey from Jerusalem the valley opens, and little  orchards give indication of a more fertile country, as well as of  the proximity of the Holy City.  Silently and thoughtfully we  approached our destination, straining our eyes to the utmost to  pierce the jealous twilight that shrouded the distance from our  gaze.  From the next hill we hoped to behold our sacred goal; but  \"hope deferred\" is often the lot of mortals.  We had to ascend  another height, and another; at length the Mount of Olives lay  spread before us, and lastly JERUSALEM.          CHAPTER VII.      Residence at Jerusalem--Catholic church--The \"Nuova Casa\"--Via  Dolorosa--Pilate's house--The Mosque Omar--Herod's house--Church of  the Holy Sepulchre--Disturbances at the Greek Easter feasts--Knights  of the Holy Sepulchre--Mount of Olives--Adventure among the ruin--  Mount of Offence--Valley of Jehosaphat--Siloam--Mount Sion--  Jeremiah's grotto--Graves.    The red morning dawn had began to tinge the sky as we stood before  the walls of Jerusalem, and with it the most beauteous morning of my  life dawned upon me!  I was so lost in reflection and in thankful  emotion, that I saw and heard nothing of what was passing around me.  And yet I should find it impossible to describe what I thought, what  I felt.  My emotion was deep and powerful; my expression of it would  be poor and cold.    At half past four o'clock in the morning of the 29th May we arrived  at the \"Bethlehem Gate.\"  We were obliged to wait half an hour  before this gate was opened; then we rode through the still silent  and deserted streets of the Nuova Casa (Pilgrim-house), a building  devoted by the Franciscan friars to the reception of rich and poor  Roman Catholics and Protestants.    I left my baggage in the room allotted to me, and hastened into the  church, to lighten the weight on my heart by fervent prayer.  The  entrance into the church looks like the door of a private house; the  building is small, but still sufficiently large for the Roman  Catholic congregation.  The altar is richly furnished, and the organ  is a very bad one.  The male and female portions of the congregation  are separated from each other, the young as well as the old, and all  sit or kneel on the ground.  Chairs there are none in this church.  The costume of the Christians is precisely the same as that of the  Syrians.  The women wear boots of yellow morocco, and over these  slippers, which they take off on entering the church.  In the street  their faces are completely, in the church only partially, muffled,  and the faces of the girls not at all.  Their dress consists of a  white linen gown, and a large shawl of the same material, which  completely envelops them.  They were all cleanly and neatly dressed.    The amount of devotion manifested by these people is very small; the  most trifling circumstance suffices to distract their attention.  For instance, my appearance seemed to create quite a sensation among  them, and they made their remarks upon me to one another so openly  both by words and gestures, that I found it quite impossible to give  my mind to seriousness and devotion.  Some of them pushed purposely  against me, and put out their hands to grasp my bonnet, etc.  They  conversed together a good deal, and prayed very little.  The  children behaved no better; these little people ate their breakfast  while the service was going on, and occasionally jostled each other,  probably to keep themselves awake.  The good people here must fancy  they are doing a meritorious work by passing two or three hours in  the church; no one seems to care _how_ this time is spent, or they  would assuredly have been taught better.    I had been in the church rather more than an hour when a clergyman  stepped up to me and accosted me in my native language.  He was a  German, and, in fact, an Austrian.  He promised to visit me in the  course of a few hours.  I returned to the Nuova Casa, and now, for  the first time, had leisure to examine my apartment.  The  arrangement was simple in the extreme.  An iron bedstead, with a  mattress, coverlet, and bolster, a very dingy table, with two  chairs, a small bench, and a cupboard, all of deal, composed the  whole furniture.  These chattels, and also the windows, some panes  of which were broken, may once, in very ancient times, have been  clean.  The walls were of plaster, and the floor was paved with  large slabs of stone.  Chimneys are no more to be found in this  country.  I did not see any until my return to Sicily.    I now laid myself down for a couple of hours to get a little rest;  for during my journey hither from Constantinople I had scarcely  slept at all.    At eleven o'clock"]]]
