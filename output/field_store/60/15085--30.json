Then Kosanza, who was now fourteen years old, said to  his mother--    \"Take comfort, mother; for I will go to Yedo and seek out this  Banzayemon, my father's murderer, and I will surely avenge his death.  Now, therefore, make ready all that I need for this journey.\"    And as they were consulting over the manner of their revenge,  Umanosuke, the son of Umanojo, whom Sanza had slain, having heard of  the death of his father's enemy, came to the house. But he came with  no hostile intent. True, Sanza had killed his father, but the widow  and the orphan were guiltless, and he bore them no ill-will; on the  contrary, he felt that Banzayemon was their common enemy. It was he  who by his evil deeds had been the cause of all the mischief that had  arisen, and now again, by murdering Sanza, he had robbed Umanosuke of  his revenge. In this spirit he said to Kosanza--    \"Sir Kosanza, I hear that your father has been cruelly murdered by  Banzayemon at Yedo. I know that you will avenge the death of your  father, as the son of a soldier should: if, therefore, you will accept  my poor services, I will be your second, and will help you to the best  of my ability. Banzayemon shall be my enemy, as he is yours.\"    \"Nay, Sir Umanosuke, although I thank you from my heart, I cannot  accept this favour at your hands. My father Sanza slew your noble  father: that you should requite this misfortune thus is more than  kind, but I cannot think of suffering you to risk your life on my  behalf.\"    \"Listen to me,\" replied Umanosuke, smiling, \"and you will think it  less strange that I should offer to help you. Last year, when my  father lay a bleeding corpse on the sea-shore, your father made a  covenant with me that he would return to give me my revenge, so soon  as he should have regained the stolen sword. Banzayemon, by murdering  him on the Mound of the Yoshiwara, has thwarted me in this; and now  upon whom can I avenge my father's death but upon him whose baseness  was indeed its cause? Now, therefore, I am determined to go with you  to Yedo, and not before the murders of our two fathers shall have been  fully atoned for will we return to our own country.\"    When Kosanza heard this generous speech, he could not conceal his  admiration; and the widow, prostrating herself at Umanosuke's feet,  shed tears of gratitude.    The two youths, having agreed to stand by one another, made all ready  for their journey, and obtained leave from their prince to go in  search of the traitor Banzayemon. They reached Yedo without meeting  with any adventures, and, taking up their abode at a cheap inn, began  to make their inquiries; but, although they sought far and wide, they  could learn no tidings of their enemy. When three months had passed  thus, Kosanza began to grow faint-hearted at their repeated failures;  but Umanosuke supported and comforted him, urging him to fresh  efforts. But soon a great misfortune befell them: Kosanza fell sick  with ophthalmia, and neither the tender nursing of his friend, nor the  drugs and doctors upon whom Umanosuke spent all their money, had any  effect on the suffering boy, who soon became stone blind. Friendless  and penniless, the one deprived of his eyesight and only a clog upon  the other, the two youths were thrown upon their own resources. Then  Umanosuke, reduced to the last extremity of distress, was forced to  lead out Kosanza to Asakusa to beg sitting by the roadside, whilst he  himself, wandering hither and thither, picked up what he could from  the charity of those who saw his wretched plight. But all this while  he never lost sight of his revenge, and almost thanked the chance  which had made him a beggar, for the opportunity which it gave him of  hunting out strange and hidden haunts of vagabond life into which in  his more prosperous condition he could not have penetrated. So he  walked to and fro through the city, leaning on a stout staff, in which  he had hidden his sword, waiting patiently for fortune to bring him  face to face with Banzayemon.    [Illustration: TRICKS OF SWORDSMANSHIP AT ASAKUSA.]    Now Banzayemon, after he had killed Sanza on the Mound of the  Yoshiwara, did not dare to show his face again in the house of Chobei,  the Father of the Otokodate; for he knew that the two men, Token  Gombei and Shirobei \"the loose Colt,\" would not only bear an evil  report of him, but would even kill him if he fell into their hands, so  great had been their indignation at his cowardly Conduct; so he  entered a company of mountebanks, and earned his living by showing  tricks of swordsmanship, and selling tooth-powder at the Okuyama, at  Asakusa.[29] One day, as he was going towards Asakusa to ply his  trade, he caught sight of a blind beggar, in whom, in spite of his  poverty-stricken and altered appearance, he recognized the son of his  enemy. Rightly he judged that, in spite of the boy's apparently  helpless condition, the discovery boded no weal for him; so mounting  to the upper storey of a tea-house hard by, he watched to see who  should come to Kosanza's assistance. Nor had he to wait long, for  presently he saw a second beggar come up and speak words of  encouragement and kindness to the blind youth; and looking  attentively, he saw that the new-comer was Umanosuke. Having thus  discovered who was on his track, he went home and sought means of  killing the two beggars; so he lay in wait and traced them to the poor  hut where they dwelt, and one night, when he knew Umanosuke to be  absent, he crept in. Kosanza, being blind, thought that the footsteps  were those of Umanosuke, and jumped up to welcome him; but he, in his  heartless cruelty, which not even the boy's piteous state could move,  slew Kosanza as he helplessly stretched out his hands to feel for his  friend. The deed was yet unfinished when Umanosuke returned, and,  hearing a scuffle inside the hut, drew the sword which was hidden in  his staff and rushed in; but Banzayemon, profiting by the darkness,  eluded him and fled from the hut. Umanosuke followed swiftly after  him; but just as he was on the point of catching him, Banzayemon,  making a sweep backwards with his drawn sword, wounded Umanosuke in  the thigh, so that he stumbled and fell, and the murderer, swift of  foot, made good his escape. The wounded youth tried to pursue him  again, but being compelled by the pain of his wound to desist,  returned home and found his blind companion lying dead, weltering in  his own blood. Cursing his unhappy fate, he called in the beggars of  the fraternity to which he belonged, and between them they buried  Kosanza, and he himself being too poor to procure a surgeon's aid, or  to buy healing medicaments for his wound, became a cripple.    [Footnote 29: See Note at end of story.]    It was at this time that Shirai Gompachi, who was living under the  protection of Chobei, the Father of the Otokodate, was in love with  Komurasaki, the beautiful courtesan who lived at the sign of the Three  Sea-shores, in the Yoshiwara. He had long exhausted the scanty  supplies which he possessed, and was now in the habit of feeding his  purse by murder and robbery, that he might have means to pursue his  wild and extravagant life. One night, when he was out on his cutthroat  business, his fellows, who had long suspected that he was after no  good, sent one of their number, named Seibei, to watch him. Gompachi,  little dreaming that any one was following him, swaggered along the  street until he fell in with a wardsman, whom he cut down and robbed;  but the booty proving small, he waited for a second chance, and,  seeing a light moving in the distance, hid himself in the shadow of a  large tub for catching rain-water till the bearer of the lantern  should come up. When the man drew near, Gompachi saw that he was  dressed as a traveller, and wore a long dirk; so he sprung out from  his lurking-place and made to kill him; but the traveller nimbly  jumped on one side, and proved no mean adversary, for he drew his dirk  and fought stoutly for his life. However, he was no match for so  skilful a swordsman as Gompachi, who, after a sharp struggle,  dispatched him, and carried off his purse, which contained two hundred  riyos. Overjoyed at having found so rich a prize, Gompachi was making  off for the Yoshiwara, when Seibei, who, horror-stricken, had seen  both murders, came up and began to upbraid him for his wickedness. But  Gompachi was so smooth-spoken and so well liked by his comrades, that  he easily persuaded Seibei to hush the matter up, and accompany him to  the Yoshiwara for a little diversion. As they were talking by the way,  Seibei said to Gompachi--    \"I bought a new dirk the other day, but I have not had an opportunity  to try it yet. You have had so much experience in swords that you  ought to be a good judge. Pray look at this dirk, and tell me whether  you think it good for anything.\"    \"We'll soon see what sort of metal it is made of,\" answered Gompachi.  \"We'll just try it on the first beggar we come across.\"    At first Seibei was horrified by this cruel proposal, but by degrees  he yielded to his companion's persuasions; and so they went on their  way until Seibei spied out a crippled beggar lying asleep on the bank  outside the Yoshiwara. The sound of their footsteps aroused the  beggar, who seeing a Samurai and a wardsman pointing at him, and  evidently speaking about him, thought that their consultation could  bode him no good. So he pretended to be still asleep, watching them  carefully all the while; and when Seibei went up to him, brandishing  his dirk, the beggar, avoiding the blow, seized Seibei's arm, and  twisting it round, flung him into the ditch below. Gompachi, seeing  his companion's discomfiture, attacked the beggar, who, drawing a  sword from his staff, made such lightning-swift passes that, crippled  though he was, and unable to move his legs freely,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#20)"],[1,"from the hollow  trees are contributions to the original poetry of the eye.    Finally, the central part of this production of the Avenging Conscience  is no dilution of Poe, but an adequate interpretation, a story he might  have written. Those who have the European respect for Poe's work will be  most apt to be satisfied with this section, including the photographic  texture which may be said to be an authentic equivalent of his prose. How  often Poe has been primly patronized for his majestic quality, the wizard  power which looms above all his method and subject-matter and furnishes  the only reason for its existence!    For Griffith to embroider this Poe Interpretation in the centre of a  fairly consistent fabric, and move on into a radiant climax of his own  that is in organic relation to the whole, is an achievement indeed. The  final criticism is that the play is derivative. It is not built from new  material in all its parts, as was the original story. One must be a  student of Poe to get its ultimate flavor. But in reading Poe's own  stories, one need not be a reader of any one special preceding writer to  get the strange and solemn exultation of that literary enchanter. He is  the quintessence of his own lonely soul.    Though the wizard element is paramount in the Poe episode of this film,  the appeal to the conscience is only secondary to this. It is keener than  in Poe, owing to the human elements before and after. The Chameleon  producer approximates in The Avenging Conscience the type of mystic  teacher, discussed in the twentieth chapter: \"The Prophet-Wizard.\"          CHAPTER XI    ARCHITECTURE-IN-MOTION      This chapter is a superstructure upon the foundations of chapters five,  six, and seven.    I have said that it is a quality, not a defect, of the photoplays that  while the actors tend to become types and hieroglyphics and dolls, on the  other hand, dolls and hieroglyphics and mechanisms tend to become human.  By an extension of this principle, non-human tones, textures, lines, and  spaces take on a vitality almost like that of flesh and blood. It is  partly for this reason that some energy is hereby given to the matter of  reenforcing the idea that the people with the proper training to take the  higher photoplays in hand are not veteran managers of vaudeville  circuits, but rather painters, sculptors, and architects, preferably  those who are in the flush of their first reputation in these crafts. Let  us imagine the centres of the experimental drama, such as the Drama  League, the Universities, and the stage societies, calling in people of  these professions and starting photoplay competitions and enterprises.  Let the thesis be here emphasized that the architects, above all, are the  men to advance the work in the ultra-creative photoplay. \"But few  architects,\" you say, \"are creative, even in their own profession.\"    Let us begin with the point of view of the highly trained pedantic young  builder, the type that, in the past few years, has honored our landscape  with those paradoxical memorials of Abraham Lincoln the railsplitter,  memorials whose Ionic columns are straight from Paris. Pericles is the  real hero of such a man, not Lincoln. So let him for the time surrender  completely to that great Greek. He is worthy of a monument nobler than  any America has set up to any one. The final pictures may be taken in  front of buildings with which the architect or his favorite master has  already edified this republic, or if the war is over, before some  surviving old-world models. But whatever the method, let him study to  express at last the thing that moves within him as a creeping fire, which  Americans do not yet understand and the loss of which makes the classic  in our architecture a mere piling of elegant stones upon one another. In  the arrangement of crowds and flow of costuming and study of tableau  climaxes, let the architect bring an illusion of that delicate flowering,  that brilliant instant of time before the Peloponnesian war. It does not  seem impossible when one remembers the achievements of the author of  Cabiria in approximating Rome and Carthage.    Let the principal figure of the pageant be the virgin Athena, walking as  a presence visible only to us, yet among her own people, and robed and  armed and panoplied, the guardian of Pericles, appearing in those streets  that were herself. Let the architect show her as she came only in a  vision to Phidias, while the dramatic writers and mathematicians and  poets and philosophers go by. The crowds should be like pillars of  Athens, and she like a great pillar. The crowds should be like the  tossing waves of the Ionic Sea and Athena like the white ship upon the  waves. The audiences in the tragedies should be shown like wheat-fields  on the hill-sides, always stately yet blown by the wind, and Athena the  one sower and reaper. Crowds should descend the steps of the Acropolis,  nymphs and fauns and Olympians, carved as it were from the marble, yet  flowing like a white cataract down into the town, bearing with them  Athena, their soul. All this in the Photoplay of Pericles.    No civic or national incarnation since that time appeals to the poets  like the French worship of the Maid of Orleans. In Percy MacKaye's book,  The Present Hour, he says on the French attitude toward the war:--        \"Half artist and half anchorite,      Part siren and part Socrates,      Her face--alluring fair, yet recondite--      Smiled through her salons and academies.        \"Lightly she wore her double mask,      Till sudden, at war's kindling spark,      Her inmost self, in shining mail and casque,      Blazed to the world her single soul--Jeanne d'Arc!\"    To make a more elaborate showing of what is meant by  architecture-in-motion, let us progress through the centuries and suppose  that the builder has this enthusiasm for France, that he is slowly  setting about to build a photoplay around the idea of the Maid.    First let him take the mural painting point of view. Bear in mind these  characteristics of that art: it is wall-painting that is an organic part  of the surface on which it appears: it is on the same lines as the  building and adapted to the colors and forms of the structure of which it  is a part.    The wall-splendors of America that are the most scattered about in  inexpensive copies are the decorations of the Boston Public Library. Note  the pillar-like quality of Sargent's prophets, the solemn dignity of  Abbey's Holy Grail series, the grand horizontals and perpendiculars of  the work of Puvis de Chavannes. The last is the orthodox mural painter of  the world, but the other two will serve the present purpose also. These  architectural paintings if they were dramatized, still retaining their  powerful lines, would be three exceedingly varied examples of what is  meant by architecture-in-motion. The visions that appear to Jeanne d'Arc  might be delineated in the mood of some one of these three painters. The  styles will not mix in the same episode.    A painter from old time we mention here, not because he was orthodox, but  because of his genius for the drawing of action, and because he covered  tremendous wall-spaces with Venetian tone and color, is Tintoretto. If  there is a mistrust that the mural painting standard will tend to destroy  the sense of action, Tintoretto will restore confidence in that regard.  As the Winged Victory represents flying in sculpture, so his work is the  extreme example of action with the brush. The Venetians called him the  furious painter. One must understand a man through his admirers. So  explore Ruskin's sayings on Tintoretto.    I have a dozen moving picture magazine clippings, which are in their  humble way first or second cousins of mural paintings. I will describe  but two, since the method of selection has already been amply indicated,  and the reader can find his own examples. For a Crowd Picture, for  instance, here is a scene at a masquerade ball. The glitter of the  costumes is an extension of the glitter of the candelabra overhead. The  people are as it were chandeliers, hung lower down. The lines of the  candelabra relate to the very ribbon streamers of the heroine, and the  massive wood-work is the big brother of the square-shouldered heroes in  the foreground, though one is a clown, one is a Russian Duke, and one is  Don Caesar De Bazan. The building is the father of the people. These  relations can be kept in the court scenes of the production of Jeanne  d'Arc.    Here is a night picture from a war story in which the light is furnished  by two fires whose coals and brands are hidden by earth heaped in front.  The sentiment of tenting on the old camp-ground pervades the scene. The  far end of the line of those keeping bivouac disappears into the  distance, and the depths of the ranks behind them fade into the thick  shadows. The flag, a little above the line, catches the light. One great  tree overhead spreads its leafless half-lit arms through the gloom.  Behind all this is unmitigated black. The composition reminds one of a  Hiroshige study of midnight. These men are certainly a part of the  architecture of out of doors, and mysterious as the vault of Heaven. This  type of a camp-fire is possible in our Jeanne d'Arc.    These pictures, new and old, great and unknown, indicate some of the  standards of judgment and types of vision whereby our conception of the  play is to be evolved.    By what means shall we block it in? Our friend Tintoretto made use of  methods which are here described from one of his biographers, W. Roscoe  Osler: \"They have been much enlarged upon in the different biographies as  the means whereby Tintoretto obtained his power. They constituted,  however, his habitual method of determining the effect and general  grouping of his compositions. He moulded with extreme care small models  of his figures in wax and clay.
