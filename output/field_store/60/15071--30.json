They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was  totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply  themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste,  would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover,  the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some  powder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no  difficulty in that.    On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return  to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so  magnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one  of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably  had its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names  which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange  of their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very  boyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,    \"Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose  ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or  whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be  certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!\"    It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers  should not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the  thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it  was prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb  walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The  reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note  every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping  aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance,  which he put into his pocket, without making any remark.    \"What can he be picking up?\" muttered Pencroft. \"I have looked in vain  for anything that's worth the trouble of stooping for.\"    Towards ten o'clock the little band descended the last declivities of  Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and  trees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a  plain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood.  Great blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three  hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very  confused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava,  which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.    Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the  creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the  plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the  sailor were hiding behind the rocks.    \"What's the matter, my boy?\" asked Spilett.    \"Smoke,\" replied Herbert. \"We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred  paces from us.\"    \"Men in this place?\" cried the reporter.    \"We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to  deal,\" replied Cyrus Harding. \"I trust that there are no natives on this  island; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?\"    \"Top is on before.\"    \"And he doesn't bark?\"    \"No.\"    \"That is strange. However, we must try to call him back.\"    In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined  their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the  heaps of basalt.    From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the  air.    Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter,  signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the  rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this  exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward.  They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor  which impregnated the atmosphere.    The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what  the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.    \"This fire,\" said he, \"or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.  There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.\"    \"Captain!\" cried Pencroft. \"What a pity that I haven't got a cold!\"    The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the  smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly  between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid  odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.    Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch.  He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he  estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on  what he based this calculation,--    \"Its quite simple, my boy,\" said he, \"for, in plunging my hand into the  water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the  same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.\"    The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they  proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some  hundred paces off.    There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear  and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed  the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek  was immediately given to the watercourse.    It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain  water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over  the sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade,  ran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth  varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was  supposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance,  in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling  than the Chimneys.    As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of  the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound  in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those  coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored  to some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the  commencement of the month of April, which represents the month of  October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they  were still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and  eucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to  the manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping  banks, which were also covered with the high grass called \"tussac\" in  New Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the  Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless,  being too low.    \"What a pity!\" said Herbert, \"such a useful tree, and which has such  beautiful nuts!\"    As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti  and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings.  Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors,  kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories,  and various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism,  fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange  concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The  settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds,  and a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped  from the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush,  forgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily,  they found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous  native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as  mountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to  their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening's dinner.    Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings,  some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at  Port-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and  magpies which flew away in flocks.    A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these  birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and  these primitive weapons proved very insufficient.    Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of  quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular  flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a  height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to  another like squirrels.    \"Kangaroos!\" cried Herbert.    \"Are they good to eat?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Stewed,\" replied the reporter, \"their flesh is equal to the best  venison!--\"    Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor,  followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus  Harding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters  to pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a  chase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all  sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more  successful than his masters.    \"Captain,\" said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had  rejoined them, \"Captain, you see quite well we can't get on unless we  make a few guns. Will that be possible?\"    \"Perhaps,\" replied the engineer, \"but we will begin by first  manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don't doubt that you will  become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.\"    \"Bows and arrows!\" said Pencroft scornfully. \"T"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#20)"],[1,"mouth, because in another instant she would  have him at her mercy. He washed his hands and durst not speak between  that and the first bite.    He was an official of heterogeneous duties--he preached and taught and  lectured. He married people and divorced them. He released bachelors  from the duty of marrying their deceased brothers' wives. He  superintended a slaughtering department, licensed men as competent  killers, examined the sharpness of their knives that the victims might  be put to as little pain as possible, and inspected dead cattle in the  shambles to see if they were perfectly sound and free from pulmonary  disease. But his greatest function was _paskening_, or answering  inquiries ranging from the simplest to the most complicated problems of  ceremonial ethics and civil law. He had added a volume of  _Shaaloth-u-Tshuvoth_, or \"Questions and Answers\" to the colossal  casuistic literature of his race. His aid was also invoked as a  _Shadchan_, though he forgot to take his commissions and lacked the  restless zeal for the mating of mankind which animated Sugarman, the  professional match-maker. In fine, he was a witty old fellow and  everybody loved him. He and his wife spoke English with a strong foreign  accent; in their more intimate causeries they dropped into Yiddish.    The Rebbitzin poured out the Rabbi's coffee and whitened it with milk  drawn direct from the cow into her own jug. The butter and cheese were  equally _kosher_, coming straight from Hebrew Hollanders and having  passed through none but Jewish vessels. As the Reb sat himself down at  the head of the table Hannah entered the room.    \"Good morning, father,\" she said, kissing him. \"What have you got your  new coat on for? Any weddings to-day?\"    \"No, my dear,\" said Reb Shemuel, \"marriages are falling off. There  hasn't even been an engagement since Belcovitch's eldest daughter  betrothed herself to Pesach Weingott.\"    \"Oh, these Jewish young men!\" said the Rebbitzin. \"Look at my Hannah--as  pretty a girl as you could meet in the whole Lane--and yet here she is  wasting her youth.\"    Hannah bit her lip, instead of her bread and butter, for she felt she  had brought the talk on herself. She had heard the same grumblings from  her mother for two years. Mrs. Jacobs's maternal anxiety had begun when  her daughter was seventeen. \"When _I_ was seventeen,\" she went on, \"I  was a married woman. Now-a-days the girls don't begin to get a _Chosan_  till they're twenty.\"    \"We are not living in Poland,\" the Reb reminded her.    \"What's that to do with it? It's the Jewish young men who want to marry  gold.\"    \"Why blame them? A Jewish young man can marry several pieces of gold,  but since Rabbenu Gershom he can only marry one woman,\" said the Reb,  laughing feebly and forcing his humor for his daughter's sake.    \"One woman is more than thou canst support,\" said the Rebbitzin,  irritated into Yiddish, \"giving away the flesh from off thy children's  bones. If thou hadst been a proper father thou wouldst have saved thy  money for Hannah's dowry, instead of wasting it on a parcel of vagabond  _Schnorrers_. Even so I can give her a good stock of bedding and  under-linen. It's a reproach and a shame that thou hast not yet found  her a husband. Thou canst find husbands quick enough for other men's  daughters!\"    \"I found a husband for thy father's daughter,\" said the Reb, with a  roguish gleam in his brown eyes.    \"Don't throw that up to me! I could have got plenty better. And my  daughter wouldn't have known the shame of finding nobody to marry her.  In Poland at least the youths would have flocked to marry her because  she was a Rabbi's daughter, and they'd think It an honor to be a  son-in-law of a Son of the Law. But in this godless country! Why in my  village the Chief Rabbi's daughter, who was so ugly as to make one spit  out, carried off the finest man in the district.\"    \"But thou, my Simcha, hadst no need to be connected with Rabbonim!\"    \"Oh, yes; make mockery of me.\"    \"I mean it. Thou art as a lily of Sharon.\"    \"Wilt thou have another cup of coffee, Shemuel?\"    \"Yes, my life. Wait but a little and thou shalt see our Hannah under the  _Chuppah_.\"    \"Hast thou any one in thine eye?\"    The Reb nodded his head mysteriously and winked the eye, as if nudging  the person in it.    \"Who is it, father?\" said Levi. \"I do hope it's a real swell who talks  English properly.\"    \"And mind you make yourself agreeable to him, Hannah,\" said the  Rebbitzin. \"You spoil all the matches I've tried to make for you by your  stupid, stiff manner.\"    \"Look here, mother!\" cried Hannah, pushing aside her cup violently. \"Am  I going to have my breakfast in peace? I don't want to be married at  all. I don't want any of your Jewish men coming round to examine me as  if! were a horse, and wanting to know how much money you'll give them as  a set-off. Let me be! Let me be single! It's my business, not yours.\"    The Rebbitzin bent eyes of angry reproach on the Reb.    \"What did I tell thee, Shemuel? She's _meshugga_--quite mad! Healthy and  fresh and mad!\"    \"Yes, you'll drive me mad,\" said Hannah savagely. \"Let me be! I'm too  old now to get a _Chosan_, so let me be as I am. I can always earn my  own living.\"    \"Thou seest, Shemuel?\" said Simcha. \"Thou seest my sorrows? Thou seest  how impious our children wax in this godless country.\"    \"Let her be, Simcha, let her be,\" said the Reb. \"She is young yet. If  she hasn't any inclination thereto--!\"    \"And what is _her_ inclination? A pretty thing, forsooth! Is she going  to make her mother a laughing-stock! Are Mrs. Jewell and Mrs. Abrahams  to dandle grandchildren in my face, to gouge out my eyes with them! It  isn't that she can't get young men. Only she is so high-blown. One would  think she had a father who earned five hundred a year, instead of a man  who scrambles half his salary among dirty _Schnorrers_.\"    \"Talk not like an _Epicurean_,\" said the Reb. \"What are we all but  _Schnorrers_, dependent on the charity of the Holy One, blessed be He?  What! Have we made ourselves? Rather fall prostrate and thank Him that  His bounties to us are so great that they include the privilege of  giving charity to others.\"    \"But we work for our living!\" said the Rebbitzin. \"I wear my knees away  scrubbing.\" External evidence pointed rather to the defrication of the  nose.    \"But, mother,\" said Hannah. \"You know we have a servant to do the rough  work.\"    \"Yes, servants!\" said the Rebbitzin, contemptuously. \"If you don't stand  over them as the Egyptian taskmasters over our forefathers, they don't  do a stroke of work except breaking the crockery. I'd much rather sweep  a room myself than see a _Shiksah_ pottering about for an hour and end  by leaving all the dust on the window-ledges and the corners of the  mantelpiece. As for beds, I don't believe _Shiksahs_ ever shake them! If  I had my way I'd wring all their necks.\"    \"What's the use of always complaining?\" said Hannah, impatiently. \"You  know we must keep a _Shiksah_ to attend to the _Shabbos_ fire. The women  or the little boys you pick up in the street are so unsatisfactory. When  you call in a little barefoot street Arab and ask him to poke the fire,  he looks at you as if you must be an imbecile not to be able to do it  yourself. And then you can't always get hold of one.\"    The Sabbath fire was one of the great difficulties of the Ghetto. The  Rabbis had modified the Biblical prohibition against having any fire  whatever, and allowed it to be kindled by non-Jews. Poor women,  frequently Irish, and known as _Shabbos-goyahs_ or _fire-goyahs_, acted  as stokers to the Ghetto at twopence a hearth. No Jew ever touched a  match or a candle or burnt a piece of paper, or even opened a letter.  The _Goyah_, which is literally heathen female, did everything required  on the Sabbath. His grandmother once called Solomon Ansell a  Sabbath-female merely for fingering the shovel when there was nothing in  the grate.    The Reb liked his fire. When it sank on the Sabbath he could not give  orders to the _Shiksah_ to replenish it, but he would rub his hands and  remark casually (in her hearing), \"Ah, how cold it is!\"    \"Yes,\" he said now, \"I always freeze on _Shabbos_ when thou hast  dismissed thy _Shiksah_. Thou makest me catch one cold a month.\"    \"_I_ make thee catch cold!\" said the Rebbitzin. \"When thou comest  through the air of winter in thy shirt-sleeves! Thou'lt fall back upon  me for poultices and mustard plasters. And then thou expectest me to  have enough money to pay a _Shiksah_ into the bargain! If I have any  more of thy _Schnorrers_ coming here I shall bundle them out neck and  crop.\"    This was the moment selected by Fate and Melchitsedek Pinchas for the  latter's entry.          CHAPTER VII.    THE NEO-HEBREW POET.      He came through the open street door, knocked perfunctorily at the door  of the room, opened it and then kissed the _Mezuzah_ outside the door.  Then he advanced, snatched the Rebbitzin's hand away from the handle of  the coffee-pot and kissed it with equal devotion. He then seized upon  Hannah's hand and pressed his grimy lips to that, murmuring in German:    \"Thou lookest so charming this morning, like the roses of Carmel.\" Next  he bent down and pressed his lips to the Reb's coat-tail. Finally he  said: \"Good morning, sir,\" to Levi, who replied very affably, \"Good  morning, Mr. Pinchas,\" \"Peace be unto you, Pinchas,\" said the Reb. \"I  did not see you in _Shool_ this morning, though it was the New Moon.\"    \"No, I went to the Great _Shool_,\" said Pinchas in German. \"If you do  not see me at your place you may be sure I'm somewhere else. Any one who  has lived so long as I in the Land of Israel cannot bear to pray without  a quorum. In the Holy Land I used to learn for an hour in the _Shool_  every morning before the service began.
