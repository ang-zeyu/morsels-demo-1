Barnett  helped me in planning this cottage and the garden.\"    \"What! Barnett the landscape painter! I am a great admirer of his  work. Were you a pupil of his?\"    \"Yes, he was one of the visiting R.A.'s at the Beechcroft Studio in St.  John's Wood, where I worked for three years. We were then living in  Blackheath--St. John's Park--a hateful place. Mr. Barnett was awfully  good, when I told him we were moving, and that I wanted to live in  really artistic surroundings--he suggested that I should be my own  architect, and promised to do everything he could to assist me,\"    \"And your father hadn't a say in the matter,\" Shiel commented, with an  amused smile.    \"Not in that,\" Gladys said complacently, \"though there are one or two  things in which he has a very decided say. Father can be very  self-willed and obstinate, when he likes. But as I was remarking when  you interrupted me--\"    \"I beg pardon!\" Shiel murmured.    \"Mr. Barnett promised to assist me. He came over here with me, and we  chose this site.\"    \"Is he an old man?\" Shiel inquired, a trifle anxiously.    \"Not much more than middle aged--fifty perhaps!\" Gladys said, \"though  he looks much younger. He is still very good-looking. Well! he came  over here--we chose this site, and--\"    \"Is he married?\"    \"No! Really you seem very interested in him. Perhaps you will meet him  some day: he comes here a good deal. As I was saying, we chose the  site together, and he supervized the plans I drew up for the garden  and cottage; I don't think, perhaps, I should have thought of that  avenue if it hadn't been for him!\"    \"At all events it does you both credit,\" Shiel remarked, \"for a more  charming house and garden I have never seen. I should like to live  here all my life. I should like--\" but he was interrupted by John  Martin. \"Come, it's time we were off,\" the latter called out  brusquely, \"time and trains wait for no man!\"    \"A young ass!\" John Martin whispered in Gladys' ear, as the trio  passed through the entrance of the railway station on to the platform,  \"not a bit of good to me. Don't encourage him, whatever you do!\"    \"Encourage him!\" Gladys retorted indignantly, seeing that Shiel, who  had his ticket to get, was out of hearing. \"Do I encourage any one?  All the same,\" she added defiantly, \"I rather like him. It isn't every  one's good fortune to be as smart as you, John Martin. Quick--hurry  up! That's your train--and the guard's about to blow his whistle.\"    With a vigorous push she hustled her father into the first compartment  they came to, and Shiel sprang in after him as the train moved out of  the station.    An hour later Gladys, looking extremely demure and proper, was rapping  with a daintily gloved hand at the inquiry office in the great stone  lobby of the Modern Sorcery Company's building in Cockspur Street.    \"Have you an appointment, madam?\" the commissionaire, in a bright blue  uniform, asked.    \"No,\" Gladys replied. \"Is it necessary?    \"The firm are unusually busy,\" the man explained, \"and unless you have  made an appointment with them some days beforehand, it is doubtful  whether they will be able to see you. However, if you will step into  the waiting room and fill in one of the forms you see on the table, I  will take it to them. Which member of the firm have you come to  consult?\"    \"I haven't the slightest idea,\" Gladys said. \"I want to have a dream  interpreted.\"    \"Then, that will be Mr. Kelson,\" the man observed \"he does all that  kind of thing--tells dreams, characters, pasts, and reads thoughts.  Mr. Curtis solves all manner of puzzles and tricks; and Mr. Hamar  divines the presence of metals and water. There is a lady in the  waiting-room now, come to have a dream interpreted. She's been there  nearly an hour. This way, madam!\"--and he escorted, rather than  ushered, Gladys into a large, elaborately furnished room, in which a  dozen or so well dressed people--of both sexes--were waiting, looking  over the leaves of magazines and journals, and trying in vain to hide  their only too obvious excitement.    Having filled in the necessary form, and given it to the  commissionaire, Gladys looked round for a seat, and espying one, next  to a strikingly handsome girl, she at once appropriated it.    There was something about this showy girl that had attracted Gladys.  She was one of those rare people that have a personality, and although  this was a personality that Gladys was not at all sure she liked,  nevertheless she felt anxious to become more closely acquainted with  it. Both girls suddenly realized that they were staring hard at one  another. The girl with the personality was the first to speak. With a  smile that, while revealing a perfect set of white teeth, at the some  time revealed exceedingly thin lips, she remarked, \"It's most  wearisome work waiting. I've been here nearly an hour. I shouldn't  stay any longer, only I've come from a distance. London is so hot and  stuffy, I detest it.\"    \"Do you?\" Gladys observed. \"I don't. I find it so full of human  interest--indeed, of every kind of interest. Not that I should care to  live in it, but I like being near enough to come up several times a  week. I live at Kew.\"    \"Then you're lucky!\" the girl said, \"I'd live at Kew if I could. But I  can't--I'm one of those unfortunate creatures who have to earn their  living.\"    \"I sometimes wish I had to,\" Gladys remarked.    \"Do you! Then you don't know much about it. It isn't all jam by a long  way. I loathe work. I've been spending my holiday at Kew. I've just  come from there.\"    \"Are you by any chance Miss Rosenberg?\" Gladys asked.    \"That's my name,\" the girl replied with a look of astonishment. \"How  do you know?\"    Gladys explained. \"I've just been to the Vicarage,\" she said, \"and  Mrs. Sprat has told me about the verses. Did you really dream them?\"    \"Of course! I shouldn't have said so if I hadn't,\" Miss Rosenberg  replied angrily. \"I don't tell crams. Besides, I've never composed a  line of poetry in my life. The verses were repeated to me in my sleep  by some occult agency--of that I am quite certain. They were so  vividly impressed on my mind that I had no difficulty at all in  remembering them--every one of them, and I got up and wrote them down.  Of course they must mean something.\"    Gladys was about to make some observation, when the commissionaire,  opening the door of the room, called out, \"Miss Rosenberg;\" whereupon,  with a sigh of relief, Miss Rosenberg took her departure.          CHAPTER X    HOW THE DREAMS WERE INTERPRETED      \"Tell Miss Rosenberg I'll see her now,\" Matt Kelson said; and as he  leaned back in his luxurious chair with that dignity of self-assurance  only the man who is rich can maintain, it was hard to realise that he  and the Matt Kelson of a year ago were the same. A year ago he had  been a poor, underpaid, ill nourished pen-driver, with all the odious  marks of a pen-driver's servility thick upon him. It was true he had  been fastidious as to his appearance--that is to say, as fastidious as  any one can be, who has to buy clothes ready made and can only afford  to pay a few dollars for them; that he had sacrificed meals to wear  white shirts--boiled shirts as one called them in San Francisco--and  to get his things got up decently at a respectable laundry; but his  teeth in those days did not receive the attention they ought to have  received (he could not afford a dentist), the tobacco he smoked was  often offensive; and there were to be found in him sundry other  details that one usually finds in clerks, and in most other people who  literally have to fight for a living.    But now, all that was changed. Kelson was rich. He bought his suits at  Poole's, his hats at Christie's, his boots in Regent Street. He  patronized a dentist in Cavendish Square, and a manicurist in Bond  Street. He belonged to a crack club in Pall Mall, and never smoked  anything but the most expensive cigars. His ambition had been speedily  realized. He had passionately longed to be a fop--he was one. The only  thing that troubled him, was that he could not be an aristocrat at the  same time. But, after all, what did that matter? The girls looked at  him all the same, and that was all he wanted. He worshipped, he  adored, pretty girls; and he was most anxious that they should adore  him.    Consequently, his first thought, when he saw Lilian Rosenberg's name  on the form the commissionaire presented him, was \"Is she pretty?\" And  the first thing he said to himself directly the door opened to admit  her was, \"By Jove! she is.\"    Then he assumed an air more suited to a partner in a big London firm,  and flourishing a richly bejewelled hand, said \"Pray take a seat,  madam. What can I do for you?\"    \"I want you to tell me the meaning of these verses,\" Lilian Rosenberg  said, handing him two sheets of foolscap and then sitting down. \"They  were suggested to me in my sleep--in other words, I dreamed them.\"    \"You dreamed them, did you!\" Kelson said, noticing with approval that  the girl had well-kept white hands, and that her clothes, though not  particularly expensive, were _chic_, and up-to-date. \"Do you want me  only to interpret this poem, or shall I tell you something about  yourself first?\"    \"By all means tell me something about myself first--if you can,\"  Lilian Rosenberg said. \"I want to get as much as I can out of you.  Your fees are exorbitant.\"    \"Very well, then,\" Kelson rejoined with a smile. \"Don't blame me if I  tell you too much. You were born at sea. Being a troublesome girl at  home, you were sent to a boarding-school, where you distinguished  yourself in various ways, and last but not least, by making the  headmistress--a married woman--desperately jealous. This led to your  being removed. Removed is a more delicate term than 'expelled.' Am I  right?\"    \"Yes!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#20)"],[1,"any wise, receives its due  cause, order, and form from the steadfastness of the Divine mind. This  mind, calm in the citadel of its own essential simplicity, has decreed  that the method of its rule shall be manifold. Viewed in the very purity  of the Divine intelligence, this method is called _providence_; but  viewed in regard to those things which it moves and disposes, it is  what the ancients called _fate_. That these two are different will  easily be clear to anyone who passes in review their respective  efficacies. Providence is the Divine reason itself, seated in the  Supreme Being, which disposes all things; fate is the disposition  inherent in all things which move, through which providence joins all  things in their proper order. Providence embraces all things, however  different, however infinite; fate sets in motion separately individual  things, and assigns to them severally their position, form, and time.    'So the unfolding of this temporal order unified into the foreview of  the Divine mind is providence, while the same unity broken up and  unfolded in time is fate. And although these are different, yet is there  a dependence between them; for the order of destiny issues from the  essential simplicity of providence. For as the artificer, forming in his  mind beforehand the idea of the thing to be made, carries out his  design, and develops from moment to moment what he had before seen in a  single instant as a whole, so God in His providence ordains all things  as parts of a single unchanging whole, but carries out these very  ordinances by fate in a time of manifold unity. So whether fate is  accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of providence, or by a  soul, or by the service of all nature--whether by the celestial motion  of the stars, by the efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided cunning of  demons--whether by all or by some of these the destined series is woven,  this, at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple  form of destined events, fate their shifting series in order of time, as  by the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place. Whereby  it is that all things which are under fate are subjected also to  providence, on which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things  which are set under providence are above the chain of fate--viz., those  things which by their nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly  fixed, and lie outside the order of fate's movements. For as the  innermost of several circles revolving round the same centre approaches  the simplicity of the midmost point, and is, as it were, a pivot round  which the exterior circles turn, while the outermost, whirled in ampler  orbit, takes in a wider and wider sweep of space in proportion to its  departure from the indivisible unity of the centre--while, further,  whatever joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like  simplicity, and no longer expands vaguely into space--even so whatsoever  departs widely from primal mind is involved more deeply in the meshes of  fate, and things are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come  nearer to that central pivot; while if aught cleaves close to supreme  mind in its absolute fixity, this, too, being free from movement, rises  above fate's necessity. Therefore, as is reasoning to pure intelligence,  as that which is generated to that which is, time to eternity, a circle  to its centre, so is the shifting series of fate to the steadfastness  and simplicity of providence.    'It is this causal series which moves heaven and the stars, attempers  the elements to mutual accord, and again in turn transforms them into  new combinations; _this_ which renews the series of all things that are  born and die through like successions of germ and birth; it is _its_  operation which binds the destinies of men by an indissoluble nexus of  causality, and, since it issues in the beginning from unalterable  providence, these destinies also must of necessity be immutable.  Accordingly, the world is ruled for the best if this unity abiding in  the Divine mind puts forth an inflexible order of causes. And this  order, by its intrinsic immutability, restricts things mutable which  otherwise would ebb and flow at random. And so it happens that, although  to you, who are not altogether capable of understanding this order, all  things seem confused and disordered, nevertheless there is everywhere an  appointed limit which guides all things to good. Verily, nothing can be  done for the sake of evil even by the wicked themselves; for, as we  abundantly proved, they seek good, but are drawn out of the way by  perverse error; far less can this order which sets out from the supreme  centre of good turn aside anywhither from the way in which it began.    '\"Yet what confusion,\" thou wilt say, \"can be more unrighteous than that  prosperity and adversity should indifferently befall the good, what  they like and what they loathe come alternately to the bad!\" Yes; but  have men in real life such soundness of mind that their judgments of  righteousness and wickedness must necessarily correspond with facts?  Why, on this very point their verdicts conflict, and those whom some  deem worthy of reward, others deem worthy of punishment. Yet granted  there were one who could rightly distinguish the good and bad, yet would  he be able to look into the soul's inmost constitution, as it were, if  we may borrow an expression used of the body? The marvel here is not  unlike that which astonishes one who does not know why in health sweet  things suit some constitutions, and bitter others, or why some sick men  are best alleviated by mild remedies, others by severe. But the  physician who distinguishes the precise conditions and characteristics  of health and sickness does not marvel. Now, the health of the soul is  nothing but righteousness, and vice is its sickness. God, the guide and  physician of the mind, it is who preserves the good and banishes the  bad. And He looks forth from the lofty watch-tower of His providence,  perceives what is suited to each, and assigns what He knows to be  suitable.    'This, then, is what that extraordinary mystery of the order of destiny  comes to--that something is done by one who knows, whereat the ignorant  are astonished. But let us consider a few instances whereby appears what  is the competency of human reason to fathom the Divine unsearchableness.  Here is one whom thou deemest the perfection of justice and scrupulous  integrity; to all-knowing Providence it seems far otherwise. We all know  our Lucan's admonition that it was the winning cause that found favour  with the gods, the beaten cause with Cato. So, shouldst thou see  anything in this world happening differently from thy expectation, doubt  not but events are rightly ordered; it is in thy judgment that there is  perverse confusion.    'Grant, however, there be somewhere found one of so happy a character  that God and man alike agree in their judgments about him; yet is he  somewhat infirm in strength of mind. It may be, if he fall into  adversity, he will cease to practise that innocency which has failed to  secure his fortune. Therefore, God's wise dispensation spares him whom  adversity might make worse, will not let him suffer who is ill fitted  for endurance. Another there is perfect in all virtue, so holy and nigh  to God that providence judges it unlawful that aught untoward should  befall him; nay, doth not even permit him to be afflicted with bodily  disease. As one more excellent than I[N] hath said:        '\"The very body of the holy saint      Is built of purest ether.\"    Often it happens that the governance is given to the good that a  restraint may be put upon superfluity of wickedness. To others  providence assigns some mixed lot suited to their spiritual nature; some  it will plague lest they grow rank through long prosperity; others it  will suffer to be vexed with sore afflictions to confirm their virtues  by the exercise and practice of patience. Some fear overmuch what they  have strength to bear; others despise overmuch that to which their  strength is unequal. All these it brings to the test of their true self  through misfortune. Some also have bought a name revered to future ages  at the price of a glorious death; some by invincible constancy under  their sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue cannot  be overcome by calamity--all which things, without doubt, come to pass  rightly and in due order, and to the benefit of those to whom they are  seen to happen.    'As to the other side of the marvel, that the bad now meet with  affliction, now get their hearts' desire, this, too, springs from the  same causes. As to the afflictions, of course no one marvels, because  all hold the wicked to be ill deserving. The truth is, their punishments  both frighten others from crime, and amend those on whom they are  inflicted; while their prosperity is a powerful sermon to the good, what  judgments they ought to pass on good fortune of this kind, which often  attends the wicked so assiduously.    'There is another object which may, I believe, be attained in such  cases: there is one, perhaps, whose nature is so reckless and violent  that poverty would drive him more desperately into crime. _His_ disorder  providence relieves by allowing him to amass money. Such a one, in the  uneasiness of a conscience stained with guilt, while he contrasts his  character with his fortune, perchance grows alarmed lest he should come  to mourn the loss of that whose possession is so pleasant to him. He  will, then, reform his ways, and through the fear of losing his fortune  he forsakes his iniquity. Some, through a prosperity unworthily borne,  have been hurled headlong to ruin; to some the power of the sword has  been committed, to the end that the good may be tried by discipline, and  the bad punished.
