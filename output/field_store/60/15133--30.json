It is  for this last 21 feet that some sort of ladder is absolutely necessary.  Our guide flung himself down in the sun at the outer edge of the pit,  and informed us that as it was cold and dangerous down below, he  intended to go no farther: he had engaged, he said, to guide us to the  glaciere, and he felt in no way bound to go into it. He was not good for  much, so I was not sorry to hear of his determination; and when my  sisters saw the sort of place they had to try to scramble down, they  appeared to be very glad that only I was to be with them.    Leaving them to make such arrangements with regard to dress as might  seem necessary to them, I proceeded to pioneer the way down the first  part of the descent. This was extremely unpleasant, for the rocks were  steep and very moist, with treacherous little collections of  disintegrated material on every small ledge where the foot might  otherwise have found a hold. These had to be cleared away before it  could be safe for them to descend, and in other places the broken rock  had to be picked out to form foot-holes; while, lower down, where the  final shelf was reached, the abrupt slope of mud which ended in the  sheer fall required considerable reduction, being far too beguiling in  its original form. Here there was also a buttress of damp earth to be  got round, and it was necessary to cut out deep holes for the hands  and feet before even a man could venture upon the attempt with any  comfort. The buttress was not, however, without its advantage, for on  it, overhanging the snow of the lower pit, was a beautiful clump of  cowslips (_Primula elatior_, Fr. _Primevere inodore_), which was at  once secured as a trophy. The length of the irregular descent to this  point was between 70 and 80 feet. On rounding the buttress, the upper  end of the ladder presented itself, and now the question, between the  boy and the old woman was to be decided. I worked down to the edge of  the shelf, and looked over into the pit, and, alas! the state of the  remaining parts of the ladder was hopeless, owing partly to the decay  of the sidepieces, and partly to the general absence of steps--a  somewhat embarrassing feature under the circumstances. A further  investigation showed that for the 21 feet of ladder there were only  seven steps, and these seven were not arranged as conveniently as they  might have been, for two occurred at the very top, and the other five  in a group at the bottom. A branchless fir-tree had at some time  fallen into the pit, and now lay in partial contact with the ruined  ladder; and there were on the trunk various little knobs, which might  possibly be of some use as a supplement to the rare steps of the  ladder. The snow at the bottom of the pit was surrounded on all sides  by perpendicular rock, and on the side opposite to the ladder I saw an  arch at the foot of the rock, apparently 2 or 3 feet high, leading  from the snow into darkness; and that, of course, was the entrance to  the glaciere. I succeeded in getting down the ladder, by help of the  supplement, and looked down into the dark hole to see that it was  practicable, and then returned to report progress in the upper  regions. We had brought no alpenstocks to Couvet, so we sent the guide  off into the woods, where we had heard the sound of an axe, to get  three stout sticks from the woodmen; but he returned with such  wretched, crooked little things, that A. went off herself to forage,  and, having found an impromptu cattle-fence, came back with weapons  resembling bulbous hedge-stakes, which she skinned and generally  modified with a powerful clasp-knife, her constant companion. She then  cut up the crooked sticks into _batons_ for a contemplated repair of  the ladder, while M. and I investigated the country near the pit. We  found two other pits, which afterwards proved to communicate with the  glaciere. We could approach sufficiently near to one of these to see  down to the bottom, where there was a considerable collection of snow:  this pit was completely sheltered from the sun by trees, and was 66  feet deep and 4 or 5 feet in diameter. The other was of larger size,  but its edge was so treacherous that we did not venture so near as to  see what it contained: its depth was about 70 feet, and the stone and  a foot or two of the string came up wet. The sides of the main pit, by  which we were to enter the glaciere, were, as has been said, very  sheer, and on one side we could approach sufficiently near the edge to  drop a plummet down to the snow: the height of this face of rock was  59 feet, measuring down to the snow, and the level of the ice was  eventually found to be about 4 feet lower. Although it was now not  very far from noon, the sun had not yet reached the snow, owing partly  to the depth of the pit as compared with its diameter, and partly to  the trees which grew on several sides close to the edge. One or two  trees of considerable size grew out of the face of rock.    We were now cool enough to attempt the glaciere, and I commenced the  descent with A. The precautions already taken made the way tolerably  possible down to the buttress of earth and the shelving ledge, and so  far the warm sun had accompanied us; but beyond the ledge there was  nothing but the broken ladder, and deep shade, and a cold damp  atmosphere, which made the idea, and still more the feel, of snow very  much the reverse of pleasant. A. was not a coward on such occasions,  and she had sufficient confidence in her guide; but it is rather  trying for a lady to make the first step off a slippery slope of mud,  on to an apology for a ladder which only stands up a few inches above  the lower edge of the slope, and so affords no support for the hand:  nor, after all, can bravery and trust quite make up for the want of  steps. We were a very long time in accomplishing the descent, for her  feet were always out of her sight, owing to the shape which female  dress assumes when its wearer goes down a ladder with her face to the  front, especially when the ladder has suffered from ubiquitous  compound fracture, and the ragged edges catch the unaccustomed  petticoats. It was quite as well the feet were out of sight, for some  of the supports to which they were guided were not such as would have  commended themselves to her, had she been able to see them. At length,  owing in great measure to the opportune assistance of two of the  batons we had brought down with us for repairs, thanks also to the  trunk of the fir-tree, we reached the snow; and poor A. was planted  there, breaking through the top crust as a commencement of her  acquaintance with it, till such time as I could bring M. down to join  her. The experience acquired in the course of A.'s descent led us to  call to M. that she must get rid of that portion of her attire which  gives a shape to modern dress; for the obstinacy and power of  _mal-a-propos_ obstructiveness of this garment had wonderfully  complicated our difficulties. She objected that the guide was there;  but we assured her that he was asleep, or if he wasn't it made no  matter; so when I reached the top, she emerged shapeless from a  temporary hiding-place, clutching her long hedge-stake, and feeling,  she said--and certainly looking--a good deal like a gorilla. The most  baffling part of the trouble having been thus got over, we soon joined  A., blue already, and shivering on the snow. The sun now reached very  nearly to the bottom of the pit, and I went up once more for  thermometers and other things, leaving a measure with my sisters, and  begging them to amuse themselves by taking the dimensions of the snow:  on my return, however, to the top of the ladder, I found them  combining over a little bottle, and they informed me plaintively that  they had been taking medicinal brandy and snow instead of  measurements,--a very necessary precaution, for anyone to whom brandy  is not a greater nuisance than utter cold. We found the dimensions of  the bottom of the pit, i.e. of the field of snow on which we stood, to  be 31-1/2 feet by 21; but we were unable to form any idea of the depth  of the snow, beyond the fact that 'up to the ancle' was its prevailing  condition. The boy told us, when we rejoined him, that when he and  others had attempted to get ice for the landlord, when it was ordered  for him in a serious illness the winter before, they had found the pit  filled to the top with snow.    [Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACIERE OF MONTHEZY, IN THE VAL  DE TRAVERS.]    As we stood at the mouth of the low entrance, making final  preparations for a plunge into the darkness, I perceived a strong cold  current blowing out from the cave--sufficiently strong and cold to  render knickerbocker stockings a very unavailing protection. While  engaged in the discovery that this style of dress is not without its  drawbacks, I found, to my surprise, that the direction of the current  suddenly changed, and the cold blast which had before blown out of the  cave, now blew almost as strongly in. The arch of entrance was so low,  that the top was about on a level with my waist; so that our faces and  the upper parts of our bodies were not exposed to the current, and the  strangeness of the effect was thus considerably increased. As a  matter of curiosity, we lighted a _bougie_, and placed it on the edge  of the snow, at the top of the slope of 3 or 4 feet which led down the  surface of the ice, and then stood to watch the effect of the current  on the flame. The experiment proved that the currents alternated, and,  as I fancied, regularly; and in order to determine,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#20)"],[1," vices, fall into their opposite  extremes._      The tribes of female flute-players, quacks, vagrants, mimics,  blackguards; all this set is sorrowful and dejected on account of the  death of the singer Tigellius; for he was liberal [toward them]. On the  other hand, this man, dreading to be called a spendthrift, will not give  a poor friend wherewithal to keep off cold and pinching hunger. If you  ask him why he wickedly consumes the noble estate of his grandfather and  father in tasteless gluttony, buying with borrowed money all sorts of  dainties; he answers, because he is unwilling to be reckoned sordid, or  of a mean spirit: he is praised by some, condemned by others. Fufidius,  wealthy in lands, wealthy in money put out at interest, is afraid of  having the character of a rake and spendthrift. This fellow deducts 5  per cent. Interest from the principal [at the time of lending]; and, the  more desperate in his circumstances any one is, the more severely be  pinches him: he hunts out the names of young fellows that have just put  on the toga virilis under rigid fathers. Who does not cry out, O  sovereign Jupiter! when he has heard [of such knavery]? But [you will  say, perhaps,] this man expends upon himself in proportion to his gain.  You can hardly believe how little a friend he is to himself: insomuch  that the father, whom Terence's comedy introduces as living miserable  after he had caused his son to run away from him, did not torment  himself worse than he. Now if any one should ask, \"To what does this  matter tend?\" To this: while fools shun [one sort of] vices, they fall  upon their opposite extremes. Malthinus walks with his garments trailing  upon the ground; there is another droll fellow who [goes] with them  tucked up even to his middle; Rufillus smells like perfume itself,  Gorgonius like a he-goat. There is no mean. There are some who would not  keep company with a lady, unless her modest garment perfectly conceal  her feet. Another, again, will only have such as take their station in a  filthy brothel. When a certain noted spark came out of a stew, the  divine Cato [greeted] him with this sentence: \"Proceed (says he) in your  virtuous course. For, when once foul lust has inflamed the veins, it is  right for young fellows to come hither, in comparison of their meddling  with other men's wives.\" I should not be willing to be commended on such  terms, says Cupiennius, an admirer of the silken vail.    Ye, that do not wish well to the proceedings of adulterers, it is worth  your while to hear how they are hampered on all sides; and that their  pleasure, which happens to them but seldom, is interrupted with a great  deal of pain, and often in the midst of very great dangers. One has  thrown himself headlong from the top of a house; another has been  whipped almost to death: a third, in his flight, has fallen into a  merciless gang of thieves: another has paid a fine, [to avoid] corporal  [punishment]: the lowest servants have treated another with the vilest  indignities. Moreover, this misfortune happened to a certain person, he  entirely lost his manhood. Every body said, it was with justice: Galba  denied it.    But how much safer is the traffic among [women] of the second rate! I  mean the freed-women: after which Sallustius is not less mad, than he  who commits adultery. But if he had a mind to be good and generous, as  far as his estate and reason would direct him, and as far as a man might  be liberal with moderation; he would give a sufficiency, not what would  bring upon himself ruin and infamy. However, he hugs himself in this one  [consideration]; this he delights in, this he extols: \"I meddle with no  matron.\" Just as Marsaeus, the lover of Origo, he who gives his paternal  estate and seat to an actress, says, \"I never meddle with other men's  wives.\" But you have with actresses, you have with common strumpets:  whence your reputation derives a greater perdition, than your estate.  What, is it abundantly sufficient to avoid the person, and not the  [vice] which is universally noxious? To lose one's good name, to  squander a father's effects, is in all cases an evil. What is the  difference [then, with regard to yourself,] whether you sin with the  person of a matron, a maiden, or a prostitute?    Villius, the son-in-law of Sylla (by this title alone he was misled),  suffered [for his commerce] with Fausta, an adequate and more than  adequate punishment, by being drubbed and stabbed, while he was shut  out, that Longarenus might enjoy her within. Suppose this [young man's]  mind had addressed him in the words of his appetite, perceiving such  evil consequences: \"What would you have? Did I ever, when my ardor was  at the highest, demand a woman descended from a great consul, and  covered with robes of quality?\" What could he answer? Why, \"the girl was  sprung from an illustrious father.\" But how much better things, and how  different from this, does nature, abounding in stores of her own,  recommend; if you would only make a proper use of them, and not confound  what is to be avoided with that which is desirable! Do you think it is  of no consequence, whether your distresses arise from your own fault or  from [a real deficiency] of things? Wherefore, that you may not repent  [when it is too late], put a stop to your pursuit after matrons; whence  more trouble is derived, than you can obtain of enjoyment from success.  Nor has [this particular matron], amid her pearls and emeralds, a softer  thigh, or-limbs mere delicate than yours, Cerinthus; nay, the  prostitutes are frequently preferable. Add to this, that [the  prostitute] bears about her merchandize without any varnish, and openly  shows what she has to dispose of; nor, if she has aught more comely than  ordinary, does she boast and make an ostentation of it, while she is  industrious to conceal that which is offensive. This is the custom with  men of fortune: when they buy horses, they inspect them covered: that,  if a beautiful forehand (as often) be supported by a tender hoof, it may  not take in the buyer, eager for the bargain, because the back is  handsome, the head little, and the neck stately. This they do  judiciously. Do not you, [therefore, in the same manner] contemplate the  perfections of each [fair one's] person with the eyes of Lynceus; but be  blinder than Hypsaea, when you survey such parts as are deformed. [You  may cry out,] \"O what a leg! O, what delicate arms!\" But [you suppress]  that she is low-hipped, short-waisted, with a long nose, and a splay  foot. A man can see nothing but the face of a matron, who carefully  conceals her other charms, unless it be a Catia. But if you will seek  after forbidden charms (for the [circumstance of their being forbidden]  makes you mad after them), surrounded as they are with a fortification,  many obstacles will then be in your way: such as guardians, the sedan,  dressers, parasites, the long robe hanging down to the ankles, and  covered with an upper garment; a multiplicity of circumstances, which  will hinder you from having a fair view. The other throws no obstacle in  your way; through the silken vest you may discern her, almost as well as  if she was naked; that she has neither a bad leg, nor a disagreeable  foot, you may survey her form perfectly with your eye. Or would you  choose to have a trick put upon you, and your money extorted, before the  goods are shown you? [But perhaps you will sing to me these verses out  of Callimachus.] As the huntsman pursues the hare in the deep snow, but  disdains to touch it when it is placed before him: thus sings the rake,  and applies it to himself; my love is like to this, for it passes over  an easy prey, and pursues what flies from it. Do you hope that grief,  and uneasiness, and bitter anxieties, will be expelled from your breast  by such verses as these? Would It not be more profitable to inquire what  boundary nature has affixed to the appetites, what she can patiently do  without, and what she would lament the deprivation of, and to separate  what is solid from what is vain? What! when thirst parches your jaws,  are you solicitous for golden cups to drink out of? What! when you are  hungry, do you despise everything but peacock and turbot? When your  passions are inflamed, and a common gratification is at hand, would you  rather be consumed with desire than possess it? I would not: for I love  such pleasures as are of easiest attainment. But she whose language is,  \"By and by,\" \"But for a small matter more,\" \"If my husband should be out  of the way.\" [is only] for petit-maitres: and for himself, Philodemus  says, he chooses her, who neither stands for a great price, nor delays  to come when she is ordered. Let her be fair, and straight, and so far  decent as not to appear desirous of seeming fairer than nature has made  her. When I am in the company of such an one, she is my Ilia and  Aegeria; I give her any name. Nor am I apprehensive, while I am in her  company, lest her husband should return from the country: the door  should be broken open; the dog should bark; the house, shaken, should  resound on all sides with a great noise; the woman, pale [with fear],  should bound away from me; lest the maid, conscious [of guilt], should  cry out, she is undone; lest she should be in apprehension for her  limbs, the detected wife for her portion, I for myself: lest I must run  away with my clothes all loose, and bare-footed, for fear my money, or  my person, or, finally my character should be demolished. It is a  dreadful thing to be caught; I could prove this, even if Fabius were the  judge.           *       *       *       *       *        SATIRE III.    _We might to connive at the faults of our friends, and all offences are  not to be ranked in the catalogue of crimes_.
