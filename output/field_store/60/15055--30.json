Mix it with the rice.    Saute in chicken-fat to a light color, a jointed chicken slightly  parboiled, or slices of cold cooked chicken or turkey.

In some parts of Italy this dish is made of several kinds of cold meats,  poultry, brains, etc. (the greater the variety the better), served on  the same platter, and in Spain all kinds of cold vegetables are fried in  batter and served together.      ROAST GOOSE    All goose meat tastes better if it is well rubbed with salt, ginger and  a little garlic a day previous to using.    Stuff goose with bread dressing, or chestnut dressing, a dressing of  apples is also very good. (See \"Stuffings for Meat and Poultry\".) Sew up  the goose, then line a sheet-iron roasting-pan with a few slices of  onion and celery and place the goose upon these, cover closely, roast  three hours or more, according to weight. If the goose browns too  quickly, cover with greased paper or lower the heat of the oven. Baste  every fifteen minutes.      GESCHUNDENE GANS    Take a very fat goose for this purpose. After cleaning and singeing, cut  off neck, wings and feet. Lay the goose on a table, back up, take a  sharp knife, make a cut from the neck down to the tai. Begin again at  the top near the neck, take off the skin, holding it in your left hand,  your knife in your right hand, after all the skin is removed, place it  in cold water; separate the breast from back and cut off joints. Have  ready in a plate a mixture of salt, ginger and a little garlic or onion,  cut up fine. Rub the joints and small pieces with this, and make a small  incision in each leg and four in the breast. Put in each incision a  small piece of garlic or onion, and rub also with a prepared mixture of  salt and ginger. Put away in stone jar overnight or until you wish to  use.      GAENSEKLEIN    Rub wings, neck, gizzard, heart and back of goose with salt, ginger,  pepper and garlic and set on the fire in a stew-pan with cold water.  Cover tightly and stew slowly but steadily for four hours. When done  skim off all the fat. Now put a spider over the fire, put into it about  two or three tablespoons of the fat that you have just skimmed off and  then add the fat to the meat again. Cut up fine a very small piece of  garlic and add a heaping teaspoon of flour (brown). Add the hot gravy  and pour all over the goose. Cover up tightly and set on back of stove  till you wish to serve. You may cook the whole goose in this way after  it is cut up.      STUFFED GOOSE NECK (RUSSIAN STYLE)    Remove skin from neck of goose, duck or chicken in one piece. Wash and  clean well and stuff with same mixture as for Kischtke. Sew at both ends  and roast in hot oven until well browned.      STUFFED GOOSE NECK    Remove the fat skin from the neck of a fat goose, being careful not to  put any holes in it. Clean carefully and sew up the smaller end and  stuff through larger end with the following:    Grind fine some pieces of raw goose meat (taken from the breast or  legs), grind also some soft or \"linda fat\" a thin piece of garlic, a  small piece of onion, when fine add one egg and a little soaked bread,  season with salt, pepper, and ginger. When neck is stuffed, sew up  larger end, lay it in a pudding-pan, pour a little cold water over it,  set in stove and baste from time to time. Let brown until crisp. Eat  hot.      GOOSE CRACKLINGS (GRIEBEN)    Cut the thick fat of a fat goose in pieces as big as the palm of your  hand, roll together and run a toothpick through each one to fasten. Put  a large preserve kettle on top of hot stove, lay in the cracklings,  sprinkle a tiny bit of salt over them and pour in a cup or two of cold  water; cover closely and let cook not too fast, until water is cooked  out. Then add the soft or \"linda\" fat, keep top off and let all brown  nicely. About one to two hours is required to cook them. If you do not  wish the scraps of \"Greben\" brittle, take them out of the fat before  they are browned. Place strainer over your fat crock, to catch the clear  fat and let greben drain. If greben are too greasy place in baking-pan  in oven a few minutes to try out a little more. Serve at lunch with rye  bread.      ROAST GOOSE BREASTS    The best way to roast a goose breast is to remove the skin from the neck  and sew it over the breast and fasten it with a few stitches under the  breast, making an incision with a pointed knife in the breast and joints  of the goose, so as to be able to insert a little garlic (or onion) in  each incision, also a little salt and ginger. Keep closely covered all  the time, so as not to get too brown. They cut up nicely cold for  sandwiches.      GOOSE MEAT, PRESERVED IN FAT    If too fat to roast, render the fat of goose, remove and cut the skin  into small pieces. The scraps, when brown, shriveled and crisp, are then  \"Greben,\" and are served hot or cold. When fat is nearly done or clear,  add the breast and legs of goose, previously salted, and boil in the fat  until tender and browned. Place meat in crock and pour the clear, hot  fat over it to cover. Cool. Cover crock with plate and stone and keep in  a cool, dry place. Will keep for months. When ready to serve, take out  meat, heat, and drain off fat.      SMOKED GOOSE BREAST    Dried or smoked goose breast must be prepared in the following manner:  Take the breast of a fat goose; leave the skin on; rub well with salt,  pepper and saltpetre; pack in a stone jar and let it remain pickled thus  four or five days. Dry well, cover with gauze and send away to be  smoked.      SMOKED GOOSE    Remove skin. Place legs, neck and skin of neck of geschundene goose (fat  goose) to one side. Scrape the meat carefully from the bones, neck,  back, etc., of the goose, remove all tendons and tissues and chop very  fine. Fill this in the skin of the neck and sew up with coarse thread on  both ends. Rub the filled neck, the legs and the breast with plenty of  garlic (sprinkle with three-eighths pound of salt and one tablespoon of  sugar and one teaspoon of saltpetre), and enough water to form a brine.  Place the neck, legs and breast in a stone jar, cover with a cloth and  put weights on top. Put aside for seven days, turn once in a while. Take  out of the brine, cover with gauze and send to the butcher to smoke.  When done, serve cold, sliced thin.      STEWED GOOSE, PIQUANTE    Cut up, after being skinned, and stew, seasoning with salt, pepper, a  few cloves and a very little lemon peel. When done heat a little goose  fat in a frying-pan, brown half a tablespoon of flour, add a little  vinegar and the juice of half a lemon.      MINCED GOOSE (HUNGARIAN STYLE)    Take the entire breast of a goose, chop up fine in a chopping bowl;  grate in part of an onion, and season with salt, pepper and a tiny piece  of garlic. Add some grated stale bread and work in a few eggs. Press  this chopped meat back on to the breast bone and roast, basting very  often with goose fat.      DUCK    Singe off all the small feathers; cut off neck and wings, which may be  used for soup; wash thoroughly and rub well with salt, ginger and a  little pepper, inside and out. Now prepare this dressing: Take the  liver, gizzard and heart and chop to a powder in chopping bowl. Grate in  a little nutmeg, add a piece of celery root and half an onion. Put all  this into your chopping bowl. Soak some stale bread, squeeze out all the  water and fry in a spider of hot fat. Toss this soaked bread into the  bowl; add one egg, salt, pepper and a speck of ginger and mix all  thoroughly. Fill the duck with this and sew it up. Lay in the  roasting-pan with slices of onions, celery and specks of fat. Put some  on top of fowl; roast two hours, covered up tight and baste often. Stick  a fork into the skin from time to time so that the fat will try out.      ROAST DUCK    Draw the duck; stuff, truss and roast the same as chicken. Serve with  giblet sauce and currant jelly. If small, the duck should be cooked in  an hour.      DUCK A LA MODE IN JELLY    One duckling of about five pounds, one calf's foot, eight to ten small  onions, as many young carrots, one bunch of parsley. Cook the foot  slowly in one quart of water, one teaspoon of salt and a small bay leaf.  Put aside when the liquor has been reduced to one-half. In the meanwhile  fry the duck and when well browned wipe off the grease, put in another  pan, add the calf's foot with its broth, one glass of dry white wine, a  tablespoon of brandy, the carrots, parsley and the onions--the latter  slightly browned in drippings--pepper and salt to taste and cook slowly  under a covered lid for one hour. Cool off for about an hour, take off  the grease, bone and skin the duckling and cut the meat into small  pieces; arrange nicely with the vegetables in individual earthenware  dishes, cover with the stock and "]]]
