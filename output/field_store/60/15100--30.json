Captain Ransome was alone, silent,  motionless as an equestrian statue. The gray fog, thickening every  moment, closed in about him like a visible doom.    II    UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES MEN DO NOT WISH TO BE SHOT    The fighting of the day before had been desultory and indecisive. At the  points of collision the smoke of battle had hung in blue sheets among  the branches of the trees till beaten into nothing by the falling rain.  In the softened earth the wheels of cannon and ammunition wagons cut  deep, ragged furrows, and movements of infantry seemed impeded by the  mud that clung to the soldiers' feet as, with soaken garments and rifles  imperfectly protected by capes of overcoats they went dragging in  sinuous lines hither and thither through dripping forest and flooded  field. Mounted officers, their heads protruding from rubber ponchos that  glittered like black armor, picked their way, singly and in loose  groups, among the men, coming and going with apparent aimlessness and  commanding attention from nobody but one another. Here and there a dead  man, his clothing defiled with earth, his face covered with a blanket or  showing yellow and claylike in the rain, added his dispiriting influence  to that of the other dismal features of the scene and augmented the  general discomfort with a particular dejection. Very repulsive these  wrecks looked--not at all heroic, and nobody was accessible to the  infection of their patriotic example. Dead upon the field of honor, yes;  but the field of honor was so very wet! It makes a difference.    The general engagement that all expected did not occur, none of the  small advantages accruing, now to this side and now to that, in isolated  and accidental collisions being followed up. Half-hearted attacks  provoked a sullen resistance which was satisfied with mere repulse.  Orders were obeyed with mechanical fidelity; no one did any more than  his duty.    \"The army is cowardly to-day,\" said General Cameron, the commander of a  Federal brigade, to his adjutant-general.    \"The army is cold,\" replied the officer addressed, \"and--yes, it doesn't  wish to be like that.\"    He pointed to one of the dead bodies, lying in a thin pool of yellow  water, its face and clothing bespattered with mud from hoof and wheel.    The army's weapons seemed to share its military delinquency. The rattle  of rifles sounded flat and contemptible. It had no meaning and scarcely  roused to attention and expectancy the unengaged parts of the  line-of-battle and the waiting reserves. Heard at a little distance, the  reports of cannon were feeble in volume and _timbre_: they lacked sting  and resonance. The guns seemed to be fired with light charges,  unshotted. And so the futile day wore on to its dreary close, and then  to a night of discomfort succeeded a day of apprehension.    An army has a personality. Beneath the individual thoughts and emotions  of its component parts it thinks and feels as a unit. And in this large,  inclusive sense of things lies a wiser wisdom than the mere sum of all  that it knows. On that dismal morning this great brute force, groping at  the bottom of a white ocean of fog among trees that seemed as sea weeds,  had a dumb consciousness that all was not well; that a day's manoeuvring  had resulted in a faulty disposition of its parts, a blind diffusion of  its strength. The men felt insecure and talked among themselves of such  tactical errors as with their meager military vocabulary they were able  to name. Field and line officers gathered in groups and spoke more  learnedly of what they apprehended with no greater clearness. Commanders  of brigades and divisions looked anxiously to their connections on the  right and on the left, sent staff officers on errands of inquiry and  pushed skirmish lines silently and cautiously forward into the dubious  region between the known and the unknown. At some points on the line the  troops, apparently of their own volition, constructed such defenses as  they could without the silent spade and the noisy ax.    One of these points was held by Captain Ransome's battery of six guns.  Provided always with intrenching tools, his men had labored with  diligence during the night, and now his guns thrust their black muzzles  through the embrasures of a really formidable earthwork. It crowned a  slight acclivity devoid of undergrowth and providing an unobstructed  fire that would sweep the ground for an unknown distance in front. The  position could hardly have been better chosen. It had this peculiarity,  which Captain Ransome, who was greatly addicted to the use of the  compass, had not failed to observe: it faced northward, whereas he knew  that the general line of the army must face eastward. In fact, that part  of the line was \"refused\"--that is to say, bent backward, away from the  enemy. This implied that Captain Ransome's battery was somewhere near  the left flank of the army; for an army in line of battle retires its  flanks if the nature of the ground will permit, they being its  vulnerable points. Actually, Captain Ransome appeared to hold the  extreme left of the line, no troops being visible in that direction  beyond his own. Immediately in rear of his guns occurred that  conversation between him and his brigade commander, the concluding and  more picturesque part of which is reported above.    III    HOW TO PLAY THE CANNON WITHOUT NOTES    Captain Ransome sat motionless and silent on horseback. A few yards away  his men were standing at their guns. Somewhere--everywhere within a few  miles--were a hundred thousand men, friends and enemies. Yet he was  alone. The mist had isolated him as completely as if he had been in the  heart of a desert. His world was a few square yards of wet and trampled  earth about the feet of his horse. His comrades in that ghostly domain  were invisible and inaudible. These were conditions favorable to  thought, and he was thinking. Of the nature of his thoughts his  clear-cut handsome features yielded no attesting sign. His face was as  inscrutable as that of the sphinx. Why should it have made a record  which there was none to observe? At the sound of a footstep he merely  turned his eyes in the direction whence it came; one of his sergeants,  looking a giant in stature in the false perspective of the fog,  approached, and when clearly defined and reduced to his true dimensions  by propinquity, saluted and stood at attention.    \"Well, Morris,\" said the officer, returning his subordinate's salute.    \"Lieutenant Price directed me to tell you, sir, that most of the  infantry has been withdrawn. We have not sufficient support.\"    \"Yes, I know.\"    \"I am to say that some of our men have been out over the works a hundred  yards and report that our front is not picketed.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"They were so far forward that they heard the enemy.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"They heard the rattle of the wheels of artillery and the commands of  officers.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"The enemy is moving toward our works.\"    Captain Ransome, who had been facing to the rear of his line--toward the  point where the brigade commander and his cavalcade had been swallowed  up by the fog--reined his horse about and faced the other way. Then he  sat motionless as before.    \"Who are the men who made that statement?\" he inquired, without looking  at the sergeant; his eyes were directed straight into the fog over the  head of his horse.    \"Corporal Hassman and Gunner Manning.\"    Captain Ransome was a moment silent. A slight pallor came into his face,  a slight compression affected the lines of his lips, but it would have  required a closer observer than Sergeant Morris to note the change.  There was none in the voice.    \"Sergeant, present my compliments to Lieutenant Price and direct him to  open fire with all the guns. Grape.\"    The sergeant saluted and vanished in the fog.    IV.    TO INTRODUCE GENERAL MASTERSON    Searching for his division commander,  General Cameron and his escort had followed the line of battle for  nearly a mile to the right of Ransome's battery, and there learned that  the division commander had gone in search of the corps commander. It  seemed that everybody was looking for his immediate superior--an ominous  circumstance. It meant that nobody was quite at ease. So General Cameron  rode on for another half-mile, where by good luck he met General  Masterson, the division commander, returning.    \"Ah, Cameron,\" said the higher officer, reining up, and throwing his  right leg across the pommel of his saddle in a most unmilitary way--  \"anything up? Found a good position for your battery, I hope--if one  place is better than another in a fog.\"    \"Yes, general,\" said the other, with the greater dignity appropriate to  his less exalted rank, \"my battery is very well placed. I wish I could  say that it is as well commanded.\"    \"Eh, what's that? Ransome? I think him a fine fellow. In the army we  should be proud of him.\"    It was customary for officers of the regular army to speak of it as \"the  army.\" As the greatest cities are most provincial, so the  self-complacency of aristocracies is most frankly plebeian.    \"He is too fond of his opinion. By the way, in order to occupy the hill  that he holds I had to extend my line dangerously. The hill is on my  left--that is to say the left flank of the army.\"    \"Oh, no, Hart's brigade is beyond. It was ordered up from Drytown during  the night and directed to hook on to you. Better go and--\"    The sentence was unfinished: a lively cannonade had broken out on the  left, and both officers, followed by their retinues of aides and  orderlies making a great jingle and clank, rode rapidly toward the spot.  But they were soon impeded, for they were compelled by the fog to keep  within sight of the line-of-battle, behind which were swarms of men, all  in motion across their way.

Still walking downward to our tomb,  And yet prepare no more?    4 Grant us the powers of quickening grace  To fit our souls to fly,  Then, when we drop this dying flesh,  We'll rise above the sky.        Hymn 2:64.  God the glory and defence of Sion.    1 Happy the church, thou sacred place,  The seat of thy Creator's grace;  Thine holy courts are his abode,  Thou earthly palace of our God.    2 Thy walls are strength, and at thy gates  A guard of heavenly warriors waits;  Nor shall thy deep foundations move,  Fix'd on his counsels and his love.    3 Thy foes in vain designs engage,  Against his throne in vain they rage,  Like rising waves, with angry roar,  That dash and die upon the shore.    4 Then let our souls in Zion dwell,  Nor fear the wrath of Rome and hell:  His arms embrace this happy ground,  Like brazen bulwarks built around.    5 God is our shield, and God our sun;  Swift as the fleeting moments run,  On us he sheds new beams of grace,  And we reflect his brightest praise.      Hymn 2:65.  The hope of heaven our support under trials on earth.    1 When I can read my title clear  To mansions in the skies,  I bid farewell to every fear,  And wipe my weeping eyes.    2 Should earth against my soul engage,  And hellish darts be hurl'd,  Then I can smile at Satan's rage,  And face a frowning world.    3 Let cares like a wild deluge come,  And storms of sorrow fall,  May I but safely reach my home,  My God, my heaven, my all.    4 There shall I bathe my weary soul  In seas of heavenly rest,  And not a wave of trouble roll  Across my peaceful breast.      Hymn 2:66.  A prospect of heaven makes death easy.    1 There is a land of pure delight  Where saints immortal reign,  Infinite day excludes the night,  And pleasures banish pain.    2 There everlasting spring abides,  And never withering flowers:  Death like a narrow sea divides  This heavenly land from ours.    3 [Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,  Stand dress'd in living green  So to the Jews old Canaan stood,  While Jordan roll'd between.    4 But timorous mortals start and shrink  To cross this narrow sea,  And linger shivering on the brink,  And fear to launch away.]    5 O! could we make our doubts remove,  These gloomy doubts that rise,  And see the Canaan that we love,  With unbeclouded eyes!    6 Could we but climb where Moses stood,  And view the landscape o'er,  Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,  Should fright us from the shore.      Hymn 2:67.  God's eternal dominion.    1 Great God, how infinite art thou!  What worthless worms are we!  Let the whole race of creatures bow  And pay their praise to thee.    2 Thy throne eternal ages stood,  Ere seas or stars were made;  Thou art the ever-living God  Were all the nations dead.    3 Nature and time quite naked lie  To thine immense survey,  From the formation of the sky  To the great burning day.    4 Eternity with all its years  Stands present in thy view;  To thee there's nothing old appears,  Great God, there's nothing new.    5 Our lives thro' various scenes are drawn,  And vex'd with trifling cares;  While thine eternal thought moves on  Thine undisturb'd affairs.    6 Great God, how infinite art thou!  What worthless worms are we!  Let the whole race of creatures bow  And pay their praise to thee.      Hymn 2:68.  The humble worship of heaven.    1 Father, I long, I faint to see  The place of thine abode,  I'd leave thy earthly courts and flee  Up to thy seat, my God!    2 Here I behold thy distant face,  And 'tis a pleasing sight;  But to abide in thine embrace  Is infinite delight.    3 I'd part with all the joys of sense  To gaze upon thy throne;  Pleasure springs fresh for ever thence,  Unspeakable, unknown.    4 [There all the heavenly hosts are seen,  In shining ranks they move,  And drink immortal vigour in,  With wonder and with love.    5 Then at thy feet with awful fear  Th' adoring armies fall  With joy they shrink to _nothing_ there,  Before th' Eternal All.    6 There I would vie with all the host  In duty and in bliss,  While _less than nothing_ I could boast,  And _vanity_ confess.] _[1]_    7 The more thy glories strike mine eyes,  The humbler I shall lie;  Thus while I sink, my joys shall rise  Unmeasurably high.    _[1]_ Isaiah 40:17.      Hymn 2:69.  The faithfulness of God in his promises.    1 [Begin, my tongue, some heavenly theme,  And speak some boundless thing,  The mighty works, or mightier name  Of our eternal King.    2 Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,  And sound his power abroad,  Sing the sweet promise of his grace,  And the performing God.    3 Proclaim \"salvation from the Lord  \"For wretched dying men;\"  His hand has writ the sacred word  With an immortal pen.    4 Engrav'd as in eternal brass,  The mighty promise shines;  Nor can the powers of darkness rase  Those everlasting lines.]    5 [He that can dash whole worlds to death  And make them when he please,  He speaks, and that almighty breath  Fulfils his great decrees.    6 His very word of grace is strong  As that which built the skies,  The voice that rolls the stars along  Speaks all the promises.    7 He said, \"Let the wide heaven be spread,\"  And heaven was stretch'd abroad;  \"Abrah'm, I'll be thy God,\" he said,  And he was Abrah'm's God.    8 O, might I hear thine heavenly tongue  But whisper, \"Thou art mine;\"  Those gentle words should raise my song  To notes almost divine.    9 How would my leaping heart rejoice  And think my heaven secure!  I trust the all-creating voice,  And faith desires no more.]      Hymn 2:70.  God's dominion over the sea, Psalm 107. 23 &c.    1 God of the seas, thy thundering voice  Makes all the roaring waves rejoice,  And one soft word of thy command  Can sink them silent in the sand.    2 If but a Moses wave thy rod,  The sea divides, and owns its God:  The stormy floods their Maker knew,  And let his chosen armies thro'.    3 The scaly flocks amidst the sea,  To thee, their Lord, a tribute pay;  The meanest fish that swims the flood  Leaps up, and means a praise to God.    4 [The larger monsters of the deep,  On thy commands attendance keep,  By thy permission sport and play,  And cleave along their foaming way.    5 If God his voice of tempest rears,  Leviathan lies still and fears,  Anon he lifts his nostrils high,  And spouts the ocean to the sky.]    6 How is thy glorious power ador'd,  Amidst those watery nations, Lord!  Yet the bold men that trace the seas,  Bold men, refuse their Maker's praise.    7 [What scenes of miracle they see,  And never tune a song to thee!  While on the flood they safely ride,  They curse the hand that smooths the tide.    8 Anon they plunge in watery graves,  And some drink death among the waves:  Yet the surviving crew blaspheme,  Nor own the God that rescu'd them.]    9 O for some signal of thine hand!  Shake all the seas, Lord, shake the land,  Great Judge, descend, lest men deny  That there's a God that rules the sky.      From the 70th to the 109th Hymn, I hope the  reader will forgive the neglect of the rhyme  in the first and third lines of the stanza.      Hymn 2:71.  Praise to God from all creatures.    1 The glories of my Maker God,  My joyful voice shall sing,  And call the nations to adore  Their Former and their King.    2 'Twas his right-hand that shap'd our clay,  And wrought this human frame,  But from his own immediate breath  Our nobler spirits came.    3 We bring our mortal powers to God,  And worship with our tongues:  We claim some kindred with the skies  And join th' angelic songs.    4 Let groveling beasts of every shape,  And fowls of every wing,  And rocks, and trees, and fires, and seas,  Their various tribute bring.    5 Ye planets, to his honour shine,  And wheels of nature roll,  Praise him in your unwearied course  Around the steady pole.    6 The brightness of our Maker's Name  The wide creation fills,  And his unbounded grandeur flies  Beyond the heavenly hills.      Hymn 2:72.  The Lord's Day; or, The resurrection of Christ.    1 Bless'd morning, whose young dawning rays  Beheld our rising God,  That saw him triumph o'er the dust,  And leave his dark abode.    2 In the cold prison of a tomb,  The dead Redeemer lay,  Till the revolving skies had brought  The third, th' appointed day.    3 Hell and the grave unite their force  To hold our God in vain,  The sleeping Conqueror arose,  And burst their feeble chain.    4 To thy great Name, Almighty Lord,  These sacred hours we pay,  And loud hosannas shall proclaim  The triumph of the day,    5 [Salvation and immortal praise  To our victorious King,  Let heaven, and earth, and rocks, and seas,  With glad hosannas ring.]      Hymn 2:73.  Doubts scattered; or, Spiritual joy restored.    1 Hence from my soul, sad thoughts, be gone,  And leave me to my joys,  My tongue shall triumph in my God,  And make a joyful noise.    2 Darkness and doubts had veil'd my mind,  And drown'd my head in tears,  Till sovereign grace with shining rays  Dispell'd my gloomy fears.    3 O what immortal joys I felt,  And raptures all divine,  When Jesus told me, I was his,  And my Beloved mine.    4 In vain the tempter frights my soul,  And breaks my peace in vain,  One glimpse, dear Saviour, of thy face,  Revives my joys again.      Hymn 2:74.  Repentance from a sense of divine goodness;  or, A complaint of ingratitude.    1 Is this the kind return,  And these the thanks we owe,  Thus to abuse eternal love,  Whence all our blessings flow?    2 TO what a stubborn frame  Has sin reduc'd our mind!  What strange rebellious wretches we,  And God as strangely kind!    3 [On us he bids the sun  Shed his reviving rays,  For us the skies their circles run  To lengthen out our days.    4 The brutes obey their God,  And bow their necks to men,  But we more base, more brutish things  Reject his easy reign.]    5 Turn, turn us, mighty God,  And mould our souls afresh,"]]]
