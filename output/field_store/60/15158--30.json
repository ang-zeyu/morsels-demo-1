Each script  is a long-range symbolic model; thus, the movie as a whole is logical. This  long-range symbolic model is translated or associated to a long-range image  model. If the translation is correct, the image model will be harmonic as  well. Thus, an art movie is a logical and harmonical long-range image model.  The fundamental problem is that it is not enough for a model to be logical and  harmonical in order for it to have a good connection with the external  reality.    There are movies that try to reconstruct an external reality that no longer  exists, an 'external reality' which will never exist, or anything else in  between these very broad limits. The only condition is that the model is  harmonic and logical. We cannot see the degree of connection with external  reality from within the model. This is where the danger originates.  Independent thinking will be blocked by the large quantity of information  structured harmonically and logically.    Many art films contribute largely to the aggravation of the level of induced  schizophrenia (XS1B). At the same time, there are many movies which contribute  to the construction of long-range models that stabilize society.    ETA 9: The fundamentalisms of the world we live in    The main fundamentalism is the return to image models, and thus, the refusal  of symbolic models. Symbolic models are based on extremely complex functions,  which are not easily maintained operational. For a 'regular' brain, the energy  consumption is higher for symbolic models than for image models. However,  there is a fraction of the population of developed countries working  more  easily with symbolic models than with image models.    Example: There was a time in the evolution of the brain, when extremely  complex image models were built and translated to a symbolic form. It was the  time of the great novels (Balzac, Dostoievski etc.). Reading such works was a  sign of cultural superiority. These books are not read nowadays. The main  reason is the evolution towards symbolic models. The effort of the brain to  understand and integrate the use of remote controls, cellphones or text  editors is perfectly comparable as intellectual effort with the understanding  of the great works of universal literature.    There are too many who have difficulties to operate symbolic models. There is  a fraction of the population who refuses symbolic models; this fraction seems  to be increasing.    Example: Microprocessors (the central part of a computer) have been invented  in USA. At that time there was a tendency all over the world to produce or  reproduce such microprocessors. The first microprocessor was called 8080. It  was upgraded to 80286. These microprocessors were reproduced in Europe, former  USSR and Japan. 80386 followed, which was reproduced with great difficulties,  but starting with 80486 the tendency to reproduce such devices was extremely  low. Presently there are two families of microprocessors, both designed and  produced in USA. This is interpreted by MDT as a danger of a break between the  most advanced in the domain of symbolic models, and the slighly less advanced  ones (make your own comparison with the automobile industry). Even the  advanced cultural zones (Europe, Russia, Japan) make big efforts to keep the  contact with the most advanced (USA), but the danger of a break exists here as  well.    The fundamentalist reactions of the individuals, nations or even cultural  zones are a great danger for human civilisation. If the fraction of  fundamentalists will increase too much, then, at the limit, two things might  happen:    1. The world will fragment into nations/ cultural regions which can maintain  the rhythm of assimilation and development of symbolic models, and  nations/cultural regions which will return to image models (fundamentalist  reaction)    2. The same type of break will appear inside a nation/ cultural region.    The evolution shown at no.1, pushed to extreme, could generate terrorism, and  the one at 2 already generates 'escape' movements towards religions,  antiglobalisation, ecology etc.    ETA 10: Terrorism    The evolution of society leads, for some nations, to an incapacity of further  development based on symbolic models. These nations feel that the world is  going towards something they can't follow and understand. The solution for  them is to adhere to an invariant or universally accepted model, like a  religion or a nature/tradition conservation movement, to orient their  activity, and to offer them an easily understandable and attainable goal in  predictible time (fundamentalist reaction).    Some individuals, who have strong fundamentalist reactions, could try to  modify the society by direct action. A class of such reactions is terrorism.    The definition for terrorism considered here is: terrorism is an antisocial  phenomenon, which implies attacking some persons without an explicit reason.  It also means destruction of material goods without explicit reasons, when  these goods do not belong to a state.    If the persons attacked are the representatives of a government and the goods  attacked belong to the government, then we have acts of war. A state can  defend itself from acts of war, but in front of a terror attack, the  protection offered by the state is limited. The main reason is that the  government officials accept the limitation of their rights, and they accept a  certain discipline. These persons are well enough informed to understand that  they could be the targets of an attack. The same is valid fo defending the  goods belonging to a state.    Many terrorist movements have tried to commit war acts and not terror acts.  Thus, they try to obtain a legitimity as liberation movements, who fight for  liberty or independence against a state.    Example: ETA in Spain tries to attack only the representatives of the state or  local administration, and the goods belonging to them. It is difficult however  for ETA to comply with these rules, all of the time. IRA acts the same way,  trying to delimit itself from terrorism. Both movements make notable efforts  to be considered liberation movements at war with an opressive state, and not  terrorist movements.    Al Quaida tried at some time to attack only American military targets (thus  delimiting itself from terrorism), but the attack on WTC in New York is  clearly a terror act. The people killed were not representatives of the state,  the planes used were not military, and the buildings did not belong to the  state). However the attack on the Pentagon was not a terror act, but a war  act.    A practical aspect should be noted connected to the tendencies of terrorism:  who has vocation to build, has no 'vocation' for terrorism. To build planes,  buildings and so many other material goods supposes an immense effort on  scientific and technological levels, in labour organisation, on the social and  cultural level. Those who know how difficult these things are done, and how  many causes can block easily this process, will not have the tendency to  destroy material goods.    We change now the discussion and will refer to the individual terrorists  existing in any society. Serial killers exist, and others, who kill randomly  innocent people. By definition, they are also terrorists, even if they act  alone, without any connection to a group.    It is clear that a society can't protect itself against terrorism through  stricter laws. The tougher laws will determine the disappearance of exactly  those facilities, which permitted the progress of the society. Multiple levels  of security will produce the fragmentation of the society. Thus, due to the  reduction of the capability to communicate, the level of generalised  schizophrenia increases. This could lead to a disaster on long-term.    Not any person who refuses symbolic models will have terrorist tendencies.  There are adaptation forms to a world that evolves in another direction than  the one desired by some. In the attempt to find the individuals with  tendencies towards terrorism, one can consider a few aspects:    1.        Children who have been normal at birth, but have been abused during  childhood, are on the highest level of risk. Individuals aggressed  explicitly or implicitly by the environment, can build illegal models,  which enter their PSM; the ones with difficulties of communication have the  tendency to build too short-range models for understanding the world they  live in (schizophrenia XS 1 and 2).  2.        The stresses generating shielding models and illegal models can affect any  person, as society is very complex. For persons from 'imagistic' countries,  an important source of stress is the assimilation and operation of advanced  symbolic models. Forcing them to evolve from an image platform to high  level symbolic models can destabilize the structure of models. For the  'symbolic' countries, the same can happen on a more reduced scale.  3.        The isolation or elimination from society of the individuals with clear  tendencies towards the destruction of the democratic system.  4.        Relaxation in the protection of privacy. The so-called right to privacy  hides important sources of stress both for the people protected by this  right, and the ones around him/her. If everybody would accept the opening  of their privacy, the society as a whole would have less real problems.    The working principle of democracy should be somewhat modified, i.e. a  democratic system protects only those who respect democracy. Thus, the  individuals who fight against democracy should not be protected by the  democratic system.    Conclusion: The evolution of society is based on symbolic models. Those who  have not the capacity to follow this trend will 'run for shelter' into image  models. Slowly a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"],[0,"Faust [part 1].

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES    MEPHISTOPHELES    DOST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance?  The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see:  The way we take, our goal is yet some distance.    FAUST    So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence.  This knotted staff suffices me.  What need to shorten so the way?  Along this labyrinth of vales to wander,  Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder,  Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray,  Is such delight, my steps would fain delay.  The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birches,  And even the fir-tree feels it now:  Should then our limbs escape its gentle searches?    MEPHISTOPHELES    I notice no such thing, I vow!  'Tis winter still within my body:  Upon my path I wish for frost and snow.  How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy,  The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow,  And lights so dimly, that, as one advances,  At every step one strikes a rock or tree!  Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances:  I see one yonder, burning merrily.  Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance:  Why waste so vainly thy resplendence?  Be kind enough to light us up the steep!    WILL-O'-THE-WISP    My reverence, I hope, will me enable  To curb my temperament unstable;  For zigzag courses we are wont to keep.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate!  Now, in the Devil's name, go straight,  Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark!    WILL-O'-THE-WISP    You are the master of the house, I mark,  And I shall try to serve you nicely.  But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day,  And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way,  You mustn't take things too precisely.    FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, WILL-O'-THE-WISP    (_in alternating song_)         We, it seems, have entered newly       In the sphere of dreams enchanted.       Do thy bidding, guide us truly,       That our feet be forwards planted       In the vast, the desert spaces!       See them swiftly changing places,       Trees on trees beside us trooping,       And the crags above us stooping,       And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,--       Hear them snoring, hear them blowing!       O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing       Stream and streamlet seek the hollow.       Hear I noises? songs that follow?       Hear I tender love-petitions?       Voices of those heavenly visions?       Sounds of hope, of love undying!       And the echoes, like traditions       Of old days, come faint and hollow.         Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover       Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,--       Are they all awake and crying?       Is't the salamander pushes,       Bloated-bellied, through the bushes?       And the roots, like serpents twisted,       Through the sand and boulders toiling,       Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling       To entrap us, unresisted:       Living knots and gnarls uncanny       Feel with polypus-antennae       For the wanderer. Mice are flying,       Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing       Through the moss and through the heather!         And the fire-flies wink and darkle,       Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle,       And in wildering escort gather!         Tell me, if we still are standing,       Or if further we're ascending?       All is turning, whirling, blending,       Trees and rocks with grinning faces,       Wandering lights that spin in mazes,       Still increasing and expanding!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted!  Here a middle-peak is planted,  Whence one seeth, with amaze,  Mammon in the mountain blaze.    FAUST    How strangely glimmers through the hollows  A dreary light, like that of dawn!  Its exhalation tracks and follows  The deepest gorges, faint and wan.  Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth;  Here burns the glow through film and haze:  Now like a tender thread it creepeth,  Now like a fountain leaps and plays.  Here winds away, and in a hundred  Divided veins the valley braids:  There, in a corner pressed and sundered,  Itself detaches, spreads and fades.  Here gush the sparkles incandescent  Like scattered showers of golden sand;--  But, see! in all their height, at present,  The rocky ramparts blazing stand.

MEPHISTOPHELES    Under the old ribs of the rock retreating,  Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!  The night with the mist is black;  Hark! how the forests grind and crack!  Frightened, the owlets are scattered:  Hearken! the pillars are shattered.  The evergreen palaces shaking!  Boughs are groaning and breaking,  The tree-trunks terribly thunder,  The roots are twisting asunder!  In frightfully intricate crashing  Each on the other is dashing,  And over the wreck-strewn gorges  The tempest whistles and surges!  Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?  Far away, or nearer singing?  Yes, the mountain's side along,  Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song!    WITCHES (_in chorus_)         The witches ride to the Brocken's top,       The stubble is yellow, and green the crop.       There gathers the crowd for carnival:       Sir Urian sits over all.         And so they go over stone and stock;       The witch she-----s, and-----s the buck.

A tough old sow and the mother thereon,       Then follow the witches, every one.    A VOICE    Which way com'st thou hither?    VOICE    O'er the Ilsen-stone.  I peeped at the owl in her nest alone:  How she stared and glared!    VOICE    Betake thee to Hell!  Why so fast and so fell?    VOICE    She has scored and has flayed me:  See the wounds she has made me!    WITCHES (_chorus_)         The way is wide, the way is long:       See, what a wild and crazy throng!       The broom it scratches, the fork it thrusts,       The child is stifled, the mother bursts.  WIZARDS (_semichorus_)         As doth the snail in shell, we crawl:       Before us go the women all.       When towards the Devil's House we tread,       Woman's a thousand steps ahead.    OTHER SEMICHORUS         We do not measure with such care:       Woman in thousand steps is theft.       But howsoe'er she hasten may,       Man in one leap has cleared the way.    VOICE (_from above_)    Come on, come on, from Rocky Lake!    VOICE (_from below_)    Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake.  We've washed, and are bright as ever you will,  Yet we're eternally sterile still.    BOTH CHORUSES         The wind is hushed, the star shoots by.       The dreary moon forsakes the sky;       The magic notes, like spark on spark,       Drizzle, whistling through the dark.    VOICE (_from below_)    Halt, there! Ho, there!    VOICE (_from above_)    Who calls from the rocky cleft below there?    VOICE (_below_)    Take me, too! take me, too!  I'm climbing now three hundred years,  And yet the summit cannot see:  Among my equals I would be.    BOTH CHORUSES         Bears the broom and bears the stock,       Bears the fork and bears the buck:       Who cannot raise himself to-night       Is evermore a ruined wight.    HALF-WITCH (_below_)    So long I stumble, ill bestead,  And the others are now so far ahead!  At home I've neither rest nor cheer,  And yet I cannot gain them here.    CHORUS OF WITCHES         To cheer the witch will salve avail;       A rag will answer for a sail;       Each trough a goodly ship supplies;       He ne'er will fly, who now not flies.
