I tell you, d'you hear,  _you're not to run at all when I'm about_! You're a nice fellow and all  that, and get your quantities somewhere near right, if you do go a long  way round to do it--but I'll not answer for myself if you run, d'you  hear?... Putting your hand on a man's shoulder like that, just when ...\"    \"Certainly I might have spoken,\" I agreed, a little stiffly.    \"Of course, you ought to have spoken! Just you see you don't do it again.  It's monstrous!\"    I put a curt question.    \"Are you sure you're quite right in your head, Rooum?\"    \"Ah,\" he cried, \"don't you think I just fancy it, my lad! Nothing so  easy! I thought you guessed that other time, on the new road ... it's as  plain as a pikestaff... no, no, no! _I_ shall be telling _you_ something  about molecules one of these days!\"    We walked for a time in silence.    Suddenly he asked: \"What are you doing now?\"    \"I myself, do you mean? Oh, the firm. A railway job, past Pinner.  But we've a big contract coming on in the West End soon they might  want you for. They call it 'alterations,' but it's one of these big  shop-rebuildings.\"    \"I'll come along.\"    \"Oh, it isn't for a month or two yet.\"    \"I don't mean that. I mean I'll come along to Pinner with you now,  to-night, or whenever you go.\"    \"Oh!\" I said.    I don't know that I specially wanted him. It's a little wearing, the  company of a chap like that. You never know what he's going to let you in  for next. But, as this didn't seem to occur to him, I didn't say  anything. If he really liked catching the last train down, a three-mile  walk, and then sharing a double-bedded room at a poor sort of alehouse  (which was my own programme), he was welcome. We walked a little farther;  then I told him the time of the train and left him.    He turned up at Euston, a little after twelve. We went down together. It  was getting on for one when we left the station at the other end, and  then we began the tramp across the Weald to the inn. A little to my  surprise (for I had begun to expect unaccountable behaviour from him) we  reached the inn without Rooum having dodged about changing places with  me, or having fallen cowering under a gorse-bush, or anything of  that kind. Our talk, too, was about work, not molecules and osmosis.    The inn was only a roadside beerhouse--I have forgotten its name--and all  its sleeping accomodation was the one double-bedded room. Over the head  of my own bed the ceiling was cut away, following the roof-line; and the  wallpaper was perfectly shocking--faded bouquets that made V's and A's,  interlacing everywhere. The other bed was made up, and lay across the  room.    I think I only spoke once while we were making ready for bed, and that  was when Rooum took from his black hand-bag a brush and a torn nightgown.    \"That's what you always carry about, is it?\" I remarked; and Rooum  grunted something: Yes ... never knew where you'd be next ... no harm,  was it? We tumbled into bed.    But, for all the lateness of the hour, I wasn't sleepy; so from my own  bag I took a book, set the candle on the end of the mantel, and began  to read. Mark you, I don't say I was much better informed for the reading  I did, for I was watching the V's on the wallpaper mostly--that, and  wondering what was wrong with the man in the other bed who had fallen  down at a touch in the subway. He was already asleep.    Now I don't know whether I can make the next clear to you. I'm quite  certain he was sound asleep, so that it wasn't just the fact that he  spoke. Even that is a little unpleasant, I always think, any sort of  sleep-talking; but it's a very queer sort of sensation when a man  actually answers a question that's put to him, knowing nothing whatever  about it in the morning. Perhaps I ought not to have put that question;  having put it, I did the next best thing afterwards, as you'll see in a  moment ... but let me tell you.    He'd been asleep perhaps an hour, and I woolgathering about the  wallpaper, when suddenly, in a far more clear and loud voice than he ever  used when awake, he said:    _\"What the devil is it prevents me seeing him, then?\"_    That startled me, rather, for the second time that evening; and I really  think I had spoken before I had fully realised what was happening.    \"From seeing whom?\" I said, sitting up in bed.    \"Whom?... You're not attending. The fellow I'm telling you about, who  runs after me,\" he answered--answered perfectly plainly.    I could see his head there on the pillow, black and white, and his  eyes were closed. He made a slight movement with his arm, but that did  not wake him. Then it came to me, with a sort of start, what was  happening. I slipped half out of bed. Would he--would he?--answer  another question?... I risked it, breathlessly:    \"Have you any idea who he is?\"    Well, that too he answered.    \"Who he is? The Runner?... Don't be silly. _Who else should it be?_\"    With every nerve in me tingling, I tried again.    \"What happens, then, when he catches you?\"    This time, I really don't know whether his words were an answer or not;  they were these:    \"To hear him catching you up ... and then padding away ahead again! All  right, all right ... but I guess it's weakening him a bit, too....\"    Without noticing it, I had got out of bed, and had advanced quite to the  middle of the floor.    \"What did you say his name was?\" I breathed.    But that was a dead failure. He muttered brokenly for a moment, gave a  deep troubled sigh, and then began to snore loudly and regularly.    I made my way back to bed; but I assure you that before I did so I filled  my basin with water, dipped my face into it, and then set the candlestick  afloat in it, leaving the candle burning. I thought I'd like to have a  light.... It had burned down by morning. Rooum, I remember, remarked on  the silly practice of reading in bed.    Well, it was a pretty kind of obsession for a man to have, wasn't it?  Somebody running after him all the time, and then ... running on ahead?  And, of course, on a broad pavement there would be plenty of room for  this running gentleman to run round; but on an eight- or nine-inch kerb,  such as that of the new road out Lewisham way ... but perhaps he was a  jumping gentleman too, and could jump over a man's head. You'd think he'd  have to get past some way, wouldn't you?... I remember vaguely wondering  whether the name of that Runner was not Conscience; but Conscience isn't  a matter of molecules and osmosis....    One thing, however, was clear; I'd got to tell Rooum what I'd learned:  for you can't get hold of a fellow's secrets in ways like that. I lost  no time about it. I told him, in fact, soon after we'd left the inn the  next morning--told him how he'd answered in his sleep.    And--what do you think of this?--he seemed to think I ought to have  guessed it! _Guessed_ a monstrous thing like that!    \"You're less clever than I thought, with your books and that, if you  didn't,\" he grunted.    \"But ... Good God, man!\"    \"Queer, isn't it? But you don't know the queerest ...\"    He pondered for a moment, and then suddenly put his lips to my ear.    \"I'll tell you,\" he whispered. \"_It gets harder every time_!... At first,  he just slipped through: a bit of a catch at my heart, like when you nod  off to sleep in a chair and jerk up awake again; and away he went. But  now it's getting grinding, sluggish; and the pain.... You'd notice, that  night on the road, the little check it gave me; that's past long since;  and last night, when I'd just braced myself up stiff to meet it, and you  tapped me on the shoulder ...\" He passed the back of his hand over his  brow.    \"I tell you,\" he continued, \"it's an agony each time. I could scream at  the thought of it. It's oftener, too, now, and he's getting stronger. The  end-osmosis is getting to be ex-osmosis--is that right? Just let me tell  you one more thing--\"    But I'd had enough. I'd asked questions the night before, but now--well,  I knew quite as much as, and more than, I wanted.    \"Stop, please,\" I said. \"You're either off your head, or worse. Let's  call it the first. Don't tell me any more, please.\"    \"Frightened, what? Well, I don't blame you. But what would _you_ do?\"    \"I should see a doctor; I'm only an engineer,\" I replied.    \"Doctors?... Bah!\" he said, and spat.    I hope you see how the matter stood with Rooum. What do you make of it?  Could you have believed it--_do_ you believe it?... He'd made a nearish  guess when he'd said that much of our knowledge is giving names to things  we know nothing about; only rule-of-thumb Physics thinks everything's  explained in the Manual; and you've always got to remember one thing:  You can call it Force or what you like, but it's a certainty that things,  solid things of wood and iron and stone, would explode, just go off in a  puff into space, if it wasn't for something just as inexplicable as that  that Rooum said he felt in his own person. And if you can swallow that,  it's a relatively small matter whether Rooum's light-footed Familiar  slipped through him unperceived, or had to struggle through obstinately.  You see now why I said that \"a queer thing overtook Rooum.\"    More: I saw it. This thing, that outrages reason--I saw it happen. That  is to say, I saw its effects, and it was in broad daylight, on an  ordinary afternoon, in the middle of Oxford Street, of all places. There  wasn't a shadow of doubt about it. People were pressing and jostling  about him, and suddenly I saw him turn his head and listen, as I'd seen  him before. I tell you, an icy creeping ran all over my skin. I fancied I  felt it approaching too, nearer and nearer.... The next moment he had  made a sort of gathering of himself, as if against a gust. He stumbled  and thrust--thrust with his body.

For the whole principle of Suggestion depends upon the  principle of Mental Gender and Vibration.    It is customary for the writers and teachers of Suggestion to explain  that it is the \"objective or voluntary\" mind which make the mental  impression, or suggestion, upon the \"subjective or involuntary\" mind.  But they do not describe the process or give us any analogy in nature  whereby we may more readily comprehend the idea. But if you will think  of the matter in the light of the Hermetic Teachings you will be able to  see that the energizing of the Feminine Principle by the Vibratory  Energy of the Masculine Principle Is in accordance to the universal laws  of nature, and that the natural world affords countless analogies  whereby the principle may be understood. In fact, the Hermetic Teachings  show that the very creation of the Universe follows the same law, and  that in all creative manifestations, upon the planes of the spiritual,  the mental, and the physical, there is always in operation this  principle of Gender-this manifestation of the Masculine and the Feminine  Principles. \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" And more than  this, when the principle of Mental Gender is once grasped and  understood, the varied phenomena of psychology at once becomes capable  of intelligent classification and study, instead of being very much in  the dark. The principle \"works out\" in practice, because it is based  upon the immutable universal laws of life.    We shall not enter into an extended discussion of, or description of,  the varied phenomena of mental influence or psychic activity. There are  many books, many of them quite good, which have been written and  published on this subject of late years. The main facts stated in these  various books are correct, although the several writers have attempted  to explain the phenomena by various pet theories of their own. The  student may acquaint himself with these matters, and by using the theory  of Mental Gender he will be able to bring order out of the chaos of  conflicting theory and teachings, and may, moreover, readily make  himself a master of the subject if he be so inclined. The purpose of  this work is not to give an extended account of psychic phenomena but  rather to give to the student a master-key whereby He may unlock the  many doors leading into the parts of the Temple of Knowledge which he  may wish to explore. We feel that in this consideration of the teachings  of The Kybalion, one may find an explanation which will serve to clear  away many perplexing difficulties--a key that will unlock many doors.  What is the use of going into detail regarding all of the many features  of psychic phenomena and mental science, provided we place in the hands  of the student the means whereby he may acquaint himself fully regarding  any phase of the subject which may interest him. With the aid of The  Kybalion one may go through any occult library anew, the old Light from  Egypt illuminating many dark pages, and obscure subjects. That is the  purpose of this book. We do not come expounding a new philosophy, but  rather furnishing the outlines of a great world-old teaching which will  make clear the teachings of others-which will serve as a Great  Reconciler of differing: theories, and opposing doctrines.        CHAPTER XV    HERMETIC AXIOMS        \"The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a      manifestation and expression in Action, is like the      hoarding of precious metals-a vain and foolish thing.      Knowledge, like wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of      Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by      reason of his conflict with natural forces.\"--The Kybalion.    The Hermetic Teachings, while always having been kept securely locked up  in the minds of the fortunate possessors thereof, for reasons which we  have already stated, were never intended to be merely stored away and  secreted. The Law of Use is dwelt upon in the Teachings, as you may see  by reference to the above quotation from The Kybalion, which states it  forcibly. Knowledge without Use and Expression is a vain thing, bringing  no good to its possessor, or to the race. Beware of Mental Miserliness,  and express into Action that which you have learned. Study the Axioms  and Aphorisms, but practice them also.    We give below some of the more important Hermetic Axioms, from The  Kybalion, with a few comments added to each. Make these your own, and  practice and use them, for they are not really your own until you have  Used them.        \"To change your mood or mental state--change your      vibration.\"--The Kybalion.    One may change his mental vibrations by an effort of Will, in the  direction of deliberately fixing the Attention upon a more desirable  state. Will directs the Attention, and Attention changes the Vibration.  Cultivate the Art of Attention, by means of the Will, and you have  solved the secret of the Mastery of Moods and Mental States.        \"To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration,      put into operation the principle of Polarity and      concentrate upon the opposite pole to that which      you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by      changing its polarity.\"--The Kybalion.    This is one of the most important of the Hermetic Formulas. It is based  upon true scientific principles. We have shown you that a mental state  and its opposite were merely the two poles of one thing, and that by  Mental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed. This Principle is  known to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of  undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate upon the  opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time trying  to \"kill out\" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and  the Fear will disappear. Some writers have expressed this idea most  forcibly by using the illustration of the dark room. You do not have to  shovel out or sweep out the Darkness, but by merely opening the shutters  and letting in the Light the Darkness has disappeared. To kill out a  Negative quality, concentrate upon the Positive Pole of that same  quality, and the vibrations will gradually change from Negative to  Positive, until finally you will become polarized on the  Positive pole instead of the Negative. The reverse is also true, as many  have found out to their sorrow, when they have allowed themselves to  vibrate too constantly on the Negative pole of things. By changing your  polarity you may master your moods, change your mental states, remake  your disposition, and build up character. Much of the Mental Mastery of  the advanced Hermetics is due to this application of Polarity, which is  one of the important aspects of Mental Transmutation. Remember the  Hermetic Axiom (quoted previously), which says:        \"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted      from state to state; degree to degree, condition to      condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration.\"--The Kybalion.    The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles  of Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless one acquires the  art of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his  environment. An understanding of this principle will enable one to  change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will but  devote the time, care, study and practice necessary to master the art.  The principle is true, but the results obtained depend upon the  persistent patience and practice of the student.        \"Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the Art      of Polarization.\"--The Kybalion.    As we have explained in previous chapters, the Hermetists hold that the  Principle of Rhythm manifests on the Mental Plane as well as on the  Physical Plane, and that the bewildering succession of moods, feelings,  emotions, and other mental states, are due to the backward and forward  swing of the mental pendulum, which carries us from one extreme of  feeling to the other. The Hermetists also teach that the Law of  Neutralization enables one, to a great extent, to overcome the operation  of Rhythm in consciousness. As we have explained, there is a Higher  Plane of Consciousness, as well as the ordinary Lower Plane, and the  Master by rising mentally to the Higher Plane causes the swing of the  mental pendulum to manifest on the Lower Plane, and he, dwelling on his  Higher Plane, escapes the consciousness of the swing backward. This is  effected by polarizing on the Higher Self, and thus raising the mental  vibrations of the Ego above those of the ordinary plane of  consciousness. It is akin to rising above a thing and allowing it to  pass beneath you. The advanced Hermetist polarizes himself at the  Positive Pole of his Being-the \"I Am\" pole rather than the pole of  personality and by \"refusing\" and \"denying\" the operation of Rhythm,  raises himself above its plane of consciousness, and standing firm in  his Statement of Being he allows the pendulum to swing back on the Lower  Plane without changing his Polarity. This is accomplished by all  individuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, whether  they understand the law or not. Such persons simply \"refuse\" to allow  themselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by  steadfastly affirming the superiority they remain polarized on the  Positive pole. The Master, of course, attains a far greater degree of  proficiency, because he understands the law which he is overcoming by a  higher law, and by the use of his Will he attains a degree of Poise and  Mental Steadfastness almost impossible of belief on the part of those  who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by the mental  pendulum of moods and feelings.    Remember always, however, that you do not really destroy the Principle  of Rhythm, for that is indestructible."]]]
