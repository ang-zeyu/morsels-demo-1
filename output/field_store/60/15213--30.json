That made me mad. Oh yes, it did--Give me your hand,  Ruth.--That made my whole heart go out to Ruth. Then I was told that a  lot of the girls were foundation girls, and they weren't as rich as the  others, and they were somewhat snubbed. So I thought, 'My time has come.  I am an Irish girl, and the heritage of every Irish girl, handed down to  her from a long line of ancestors, is to help the oppressed,' So now I  am going to help all of you, and we are going to found this society, and  we are going to have a good time.\"    Kathleen's somewhat incoherent speech was received with shouts of  applause.    \"We must make a few rules,\" she continued when her young companions had  ceased to shout--\"just a few big rules which will be quite easy for all  of us to obey.\"    \"Certainly,\" said Kate. \"And I have brought a note-book with me, and if  you will dictate them, Kathleen, I will jot them down.\"    \"That is easy enough,\" said Kathleen. \"Well, I am queen.\"    \"Certainly you are!\" \"Who else could be?\" \"Of course you are queen!\"  \"Darling!\" \"Dear!\" \"Sweet!\" \"Duck!\" fell from various pairs of lips.    \"Thank you,\" said Kathleen, looking round at them, her dark-blue eyes  becoming dewy with a sudden emotion. \"I think,\" she added, \"I love you  all already, and there is nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you.\"    \"Hear her, the dear! She is bringing a fine change into our lives, cried  a mass of girls who stood a little out of the line of light.    \"Well,\" said Kathleen, \"I am queen, and I have my Cabinet. Now the girls  of my Cabinet are the following: Ruth Craven is my Prime Minister; Kate  Rourke comes next in importance; then follow Susy Hopkins, Clara Sawyer,  Hannah Johnson, Rosy Myers, and Mary Rand. Now all of you girls whom I  have named are expected to uphold order--such order as is alone  necessary for the Wild Irish Girls. You are expected on all occasions to  uphold the authority of me, your queen. You are never under any  circumstances to breathe a word against dear old Ireland. The other  girls who join the society will be looked after by you; you will  instruct them in our rules, and you will help them to be good members of  a most important society. I believe there are a great many girls willing  to join. If so, will they hold up their hands?\"    Immediately a great show of hands was visible.    \"Now, Kate Rourke,\" cried Kathleen, \"please take down the names of the  girls who intend to become members of the Wild Irish Girls.\"    The girls came forward one by one, and Kate took down their names; and  it was quickly discovered that, out of the hundred foundationers who  belonged to the Great Shirley School, sixty had joined Kathleen's  society.    \"We shall soon get the remaining forty,\" said Mary Rand. \"They will be  all agog to come on. Their positions are not so very pleasant as it is,  poor things!\"    \"Perhaps sixty are about as many as we can manage for the present,\" said  Kathleen. \"Now, girls, I intend to present you each with a tiny badge. I  have a bag full of them here. Will you each come forward and accept the  badge of membership?\"    Kathleen's badges were very much admired, the eager girls bending down  towards the light of the lamps in order to examine them more thoroughly.  She had strung narrow green ribbon through each of the little silver  hearts, and the girls could therefore slip them over their heads at  once.    \"You must hide them,\" said Kathleen. \"The thing about these badges is  that you will always feel them pressing against your hearts, and nobody  else will know anything about them. They belong to Ireland and to me--to  the home of the free and to Kathleen O'Hara. They seal you as my loving  friends and followers for ever and ever.\"    Girls are easily impressed, and Kathleen's words were so fervent that  some of them felt quite choky about the throat. They received their  badges with hands that very nearly trembled. Kathleen next handed a  slightly handsomer badge, but with exactly the same device, to the  members of her Cabinet. Finally, she took the box of pale-blue cashmere  blouses and opened it in the light of the lamps. The enthusiasm, which  had been extremely keen before the appearance of the blouses, now rose  to fever-height. Whom were these exquisite creations meant for? Kathleen  smiled as she handed one to Mary Rand, another to Ruth Craven, another  to Kate Rourke, and finally to each member of her Cabinet.    \"I wish I could give you all a blouse apiece,\" she said to the other  girls of the society, \"but I am afraid that is not within my means. I  chose these sweet blouses on purpose, because I know you could wear them  at any time, girls,\" she added, turning to the members of her Cabinet.  \"Outsiders won't know. They will wonder at the beauty of your dress, but  they won't know what it means; but _we_ will know,\" she shouted aloud to  her companions--\"we will know that these girls belong to us and to old  Ireland, and in particular to me, and they will be faithful to me as  their queen.\"    \"Oh dear,\" said little Alice Harding, a pale-faced girl, who loved fine  dress and never could aspire to it, \"what means can I take to become a  member of the Cabinet?\"    \"By being a very good outside member, and trusting to your luck,\"  laughed Kathleen. \"But the time is passing, and we must proceed to what  little business is left for to-night.\"    Each member of the Cabinet took possession of her own blouse, wrapped it  up tenderly, and tucked it under her arm. Kathleen desired some one to  throw the tell-tale box away, and then she collected her followers round  her.    \"Now,\" she said, _\"Rule One_. To stick through thick and thin each to  the other.\"    \"Yes!\" cried every voice.    _\"Rule Two._ If possible, never to quarrel each with the other.\"    This rule also was received with acclamations.    _\"Rule Three._ To have a bit of fun all to ourselves at least once a  week.\"    This rule quite \"brought down the house.\" They shouted so loud that if  the spot had been less lonely some one would certainly have taken  cognizance of their proceedings.    _\"Rule Four._ That as far as possible we hold ourselves aloof from the  paying members of the Great Shirley School.\"    This rule was not quite as enthusiastically received. The foundationers  were not altogether without friends amongst the other girls of the  school. Ruth Craven in particular had several.    \"I don't think that is a very fair rule,\" she said. \"I am fond of Alice  Tennant, and I am fond of Cassandra Weldon.\"    \"And I care for Lucy Sharp\"; \"And I am devoted to Amelia Dawson,\" said  other members of the Cabinet.    Nevertheless Kathleen was firm.    \"The rule must be held,\" she said. \"In a society like ours there are  always rules which are not quite agreeable to every one. My principal  object in starting this society is to put those horrid paying girls in  their proper places. There must not be friendship--not real friendship,  I mean--between us and them.\"    \"You are a paying girl yourself,\" suddenly exclaimed Mary Rand.    \"I know. I wish I were not, but I can't help myself. You must allow me  to stand alone; I am your queen.\"    \"That you are, and I love you,\" said Mary.    \"This rule must hold good,\" repeated Kathleen. \"I must insist on my  society adhering to it.--Ruth Craven, why are you silent?\"    \"Because I earnestly wish I had not joined. I cannot give up Cassandra,  nor Alice, nor--nor other girls.\"    \"Nonsense, Ruth! You dare not fail me now,\" said Kathleen, with  enthusiasm. \"I will make it up to you. You shall come with me to Ireland  in the summer. You shall. Oh Ruth, don't fail me!\"    \"I won't; but I hate that rule.\"    \"And, girls, I think we must part now,\" said Kate Rourke. \"It is getting  late, and it would never do for our secret meetings to be discovered.\"    \"Whatever happens, we must stick together,\" said Kathleen. \"Well,  good-night; we meet again this day week.\"    There was quite a flutter of excitement along that lonely road as the  Wild Irish Girls returned to their different homes. Susy Hopkins felt  quite the happiest and most light-hearted of any. By-and-by she and Ruth  Craven found themselves the only girls who were walking down the road  called Southwood Lane. This road led right into the centre of the shops  where Susy's mother lived.    \"What a good thing,\" said Susy, \"that I took the latchkey with me! It is  past ten o'clock. Mother would be wild if she had to sit up so late.\"    Ruth was silent.    \"Aren't you happy, Ruthie? Don't you think it is all splendid?\" cried  Susy.    \"Yes and no,\" said Ruth. \"You see, I am a foundationer, and when she  pressed me to join I hated not to; but now I am sorry that I have  joined. What am I to do about Cassandra and about Alice?\"    \"You think a great deal about Cassandra, don't you?\"    \"Oh, yes; she is quite a splendid girl, and she has been so very good to  me.\"    \"I suppose you are quite in love with her?\"    \"No, I don't think I am. It isn't my way to fall violently in love with  girls, like some of the rest of you. But I like her; and I like Alice  Tennant.\"    \"All the same,\" said Susy, \"it is worth sacrificing a little thing to  belong to the Wild Irish Girls. Did you ever in all your life see any  one look more splendid than Kathleen as she stood with the light of  those big lamps upon her? She is a wonderful girl--so graceful, and with  such a power of eloquence. And she has such a way of just taking you by  storm; and her language is so poetic. Oh, I adore her! She is the sort  of girl that I could die for. If all Irish girls are like her, Ireland  must be a wonderful country to live in.\"    \"But they are not,\" said Ruth. \"Half of them are quite commonplace. She  happens to be rich and beautiful, and to have a taking way; but all the  others are not like her, I am certain of it.\"    \"Anyhow, whether they are or not,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],[0,"The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#20)"],[1,"next morning there was a fresh wind, the  \"McLellan\" was caught again, and the water poured into her, a steady  stream. She drifted about unmanageable, now into one ship, now into  another, and the English whalemen began to pour on board, to help  themselves to such plunder as they chose. At the Captain's request, Sir  Edward Belcher put an end to this, sent sentries on board, and working  parties, to clear her as far as might be, and keep account of what her  stores were and where they went to. In a day or two more she sank to the  water's edge and a friendly charge or two of powder put her out of the  way of harm to the rest of the fleet. After such a week spent together  it will easily be understood that the New London whalemen did not feel  strangers on board one of Sir Edward's vessels when they found her  \"ready for occupation\" three years and more afterwards.    In this tussle with the ice, the \"Resolute\" was nipped once or twice,  but she has known harder nips than that since. As July wore away, she  made her way across Baffin's Bay, and on the 10th of August made Beechey  Island,--known now as the head-quarters for years of the searching  squadrons, because, as it happened, the place where the last traces of  Franklin's ships were found,--the wintering place of his first winter.  But Captain Kellett was on what is called the \"western search,\" and he  only stayed at Beechey Island to complete his provisions from the  storeships, and in the few days which this took, to see for himself the  sad memorials of Franklin's party,--and then the \"Resolute\" and  \"Intrepid\" were away, through Barrow's Straits,--on the track which  Parry ran along with such success thirty-three years before,--and which  no one had followed with as good fortune as he, until now.    On the 15th of August Captain Kellett was off; bade good by to the party  at Beechey Island, and was to try his fortune in independent command. He  had not the best of luck at starting. The reader must remember that one  great object of these Arctic expeditions was to leave provisions for  starving men. For such a purpose, and for travelling parties of his own  over the ice, Captain Kellett was to leave a depot at Assistance Bay,  some thirty miles only from Beechey Island. In nearing for that purpose  the \"Resolute\" grounded, was left with but seven feet of water, the ice  threw her over on her starboard bilge, and she was almost lost. Not  quite lost, however, or we should not be telling her story. At midnight  she was got off, leaving sixty feet of her false keel behind. Captain  Kellett forged on in her,--left a depot here and another there,--and at  the end of the short Arctic summer had come as far westward as Sir  Edward Parry came. Here is the most westerly point the reader will find  on most maps far north in America,--the Melville Island of Captain  Parry. Captain Kellett's associate, Captain McClintock of the  \"Intrepid,\" had commanded the only party which had been here since  Parry. In 1851 he came over from Austin's squadron with a sledge party.  So confident is every one there that nobody has visited those parts  unless he was sent, that McClintock encouraged his men one day by  telling them that if they got on well, they should have an old cart  Parry had left thirty-odd years before, to make a fire of. Sure enough;  they came to the place, and there was the wreck of the cart just as  Parry left it. They even found the ruts the old cart left in the ground  as if they had not been left a week. Captain Kellett came into harbor,  and with great spirit he and his officers began to prepare for the  extended searching parties of the next spring. The \"Resolute\" and her  tender came to anchor off Dealy Island, and there she spent the next  eleven months of her life, with great news around her in that time.    There is not much time for travelling in autumn. The days grow very  short and very cold. But what, days there were were spent in sending out  carts and sledges with depots of provisions, which the parties of the  next spring could use. Different officers were already assigned to  different lines of search in spring. On their journeys they would be  gone three months and more, with a party of some eight men,--dragging a  sled very like a Yankee wood-sled with their instruments and provisions,  over ice and snow. To extend those searches as much as possible, and to  prepare the men for that work when it should come, advanced depots were  now sent forward in the autumn, under the charge of the gentlemen who  would have to use them in the spring.    One of these parties, the \"South line of Melville Island\" party, was  under a spirited young officer Mr. Mecham, who had tried such service in  the last expedition. He had two of \"her Majesty's sledges,\" \"The  Discovery\" and \"The Fearless,\" a depot of twenty days' provision to be  used in the spring, and enough for twenty-five days' present use. All  the sledges had little flags, made by some young lady friends of Sir  Edward Belcher's. Mr. Mecham's bore an armed hand and sword on a white  ground, with the motto, \"_Per mare, per terram, per glaciem_\" Over mud,  land, snow, and ice they carried their depot, and were nearly back,  when, on the 12th of October, 1852, Mr. Mecham made the great discovery  of the expedition.    On the shore of Melville Island, above Winter Harbor, is a great  sandstone boulder, ten feet high, seven or eight broad, and twenty and  more long, which is known to all those who have anything to do with  those regions as \"Parry's sandstone,\" for it stood near Parry's  observatory the winter he spent here, and Mr. Fisher, his surgeon, cut  on a flat face of it this inscription:--         HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S       SHIPS HECLA AND GRIPER,             COMMANDED BY      W.E. PARRY AND MR. LIDDON,       WINTERED IN THE ADJACENT           HARBOR 1819-20.                     A. FISHER, SCULPT.    It was a sort of God Terminus put up to mark the end of that expedition,  as the Danish gentlemen tell us our Dighton rock is the last point of  Thorfinn's expedition to these parts. Nobody came to read Mr. Fisher's  inscription for thirty years and more,--a little Arctic hare took up her  home under the great rock, and saw the face of man for the first time  when, on the 5th of June, 1851, Mr. McClintock, on his first expedition  this way, had stopped to see whether possibly any of Franklin's men had  ever visited it. He found no signs of them, had not so much time as Mr.  Fisher for stone-cutting, but carved the figures 1851 on the stone, and  left it and the hare. To this stone, on his way back to the \"Resolute,\"  Mr. Mecham came again (as we said) on the 12th of October, one memorable  Tuesday morning, having been bidden to leave a record there. He went on  in advance of his party, meaning to cut 1852 on the stone. On top of it  was a small cairn of stones built by Mr. McClintock the year before.  Mecham examined this, and to his surprise a copper cylinder rolled out  from under a spirit tin. \"On opening it, I drew out a roll folded in a  bladder, which, being frozen, broke and crumbled. From its dilapidated  appearance, I thought at the moment it must be some record of Sir Edward  Parry, and, fearing I might damage it, laid it down with the intention  of lighting the fire to thaw it. My curiosity, however, overcame my  prudence, and on opening it carefully with my knife, I came to a roll of  cartridge paper with the impression fresh upon the seals. My  astonishment may be conceived on finding it contained an account of the  proceedings of H.M. ship 'Investigator' since parting company with the  \"Herald\" [Captain Kellett's old ship] in August, 1850, in Behring's  Straits. Also a chart which disclosed to view not only the long-sought  Northwest Passage, but the completion of the survey of Banks and  Wollaston lands. Opened and indorsed Commander McClintock's despatch;  found it contained the following additions:--        \"'Opened and copied by his old friend and messmate upon this date,      April 28, 1852. ROBERT McCLURE        \"'Party all well and return to Investigator to-day.'\"    A great discovery indeed to flash across one in a minute. The  \"Investigator\" had not been heard from for more than two years. Here was  news of her not yet six months old. The Northwest Passage had been  dreamed of for three centuries and more. Here was news of its  discovery,--news that had been known to Captain McClure for two years.  McClure and McClintock were lieutenants together in the \"Enterprise\"  when she was sent after Sir John Franklin in 1848, and wintered together  at Port Leopold the next winter. Now, from different hemispheres, they  had come so near meeting at this old block of sandstone. Mr. Mecham bade  his mate build a new cairn, to put the record of the story in, and  hurried on to the \"Resolute\" with his great news,--news of almost  everybody but Sir John Franklin. Strangely enough, the other expedition,  Captain Collinson's, had had a party in that neighborhood, between the  other two, under Mr. Parks; but it was his extreme point possible, and  he could not reach the Sandstone, though he saw the ruts of McClure's  sleigh. This was not known till long afterwards.    The \"Investigator,\" as it appeared from this despatch of Captain  McClure's, had been frozen up in the Bay of Mercy of Banks Land: Banks  Land having been for thirty years at once an Ultima Thule and Terra  Incognita, put down on the maps where Captain Parry saw it across thirty  miles of ice and water in 1819. Perhaps she was still in that same bay:  these old friends wintering there, while the \"Resolute\" and \"Intrepid\"  were lying under Dealy Island, and only one hundred and seventy miles  between. It must have been tantalizing to all parties to wait the winter  through, and not even get a message across. But until winter made it too  cold and dark to travel, the ice in the strait was so broken up that it"]]]
