Wanting in any one of these qualifications, an engineer is more or  less disqualified for important work. It is said that a distinguished  engineer was always afraid to cross his own bridges, although built in  the most thorough and approved manner. He was deficient in confidence.  Another engineer distinguished for his mathematical attainments built  a bridge which promptly collapsed at the first opportunity. On  overhauling his computations he ejaculated somewhat forcibly, \"That  confounded minus sign! It should have been plus.\" He was deficient in  sound judgment, or what is sometimes called \"horse sense.\"    Another and more common defect in young engineers is a want of  thoroughness. It is generally best to go to the bottom of a question  at first and keep at it until it is thoroughly and fully completed.  Confucius says, \"If thou hast aught to do, first consider, second act,  third let the soul resume her tranquillity.\" Those who begin a great  many things and never fully complete them lose a great deal of  valuable time, but do very little valuable work. The way to avoid this  difficulty is to be cautious about beginning things, but when once  started don't leave it until you are satisfied to leave it for good.  There is an Arabian saying, \"Never undertake _all_ you can do, for he  who undertakes _all_ he can do will frequently undertake _more_ than  he can do.\"    Another common error is extravagance. On the plea that \"the best is  always the cheapest,\" and to be sure of a large factor of safety, or  as the late Mr. Holley called it a \"factor of ignorance,\" without much  trouble to themselves, some engineers use more or better materials  than the work requires, and thus greatly increase the cost without any  corresponding advantage. Almost any engineer can do almost anything in  the way of engineering if not limited by the cost, but the man who  knows just what materials to use and how to use them so that they will  answer the purpose as to strength and durability can save his own  salary to his employer many times over by simply omitting unnecessary  expense.           *       *       *       *       *          HOW MECHANICAL RUBBER GOODS ARE MADE.      While the manufacture of rubber goods is in no sense a secret  industry, the majority of buyers and users of such goods have never  stepped inside of a rubber mill, and many have very crude ideas as to  how the goods are made up. In ordinary garden hose, for instance, the  process is as follows: The inner tubing is made of a strip of rubber  fifty feet in length, which is laid on a long zinc-covered table and  its edges drawn together over a hose pole. The cover, which is of what  is called \"friction,\" that is cloth with rubber forced through its  meshes, comes to the hose maker in strips, cut on the bias, which are  wound around the outside of the tube and adhere tightly to it. The  hose pole is then put in something like a fifty foot lathe, and while  the pole revolves slowly, it is tightly wrapped with strips of cloth,  in order that it may not get out of shape while undergoing the process  of vulcanizing. When a number of these hose poles have been covered in  this way they are laid in a pan set on trucks and are then run into a  long boiler, shut in, and live steam is turned on. When the goods are  cured steam is blown off, the vulcanizer opened and the cloths are  removed. The hose is then slipped off the pole by forcing air from a  compressor between the rubber and the hose pole. This, of course, is  what is known as hose that has a seam in it.    For seamless hose the tube is made in a tubing machine and slipped  upon the hose pole by reversing the process that is used in removing  hose by air compression. In other words, a knot is tied in one end of  the fifty foot tube and the other end is placed against the hose pole  and being carefully inflated with air it is slipped on without the  least trouble. For various kinds of hose the processes vary, and there  are machines for winding with wire and intricate processes for the  heavy grades of suction hose, etc. For steam hose, brewers', and acid  hose, special resisting compounds are used, that as a rule are the  secrets of the various manufacturers. Cotton hose is woven through  machines expressly designed for that purpose, and afterward has a  half-cured rubber tube drawn through it. One end is then securely  stopped up and the other end forced on a cone through which steam is  introduced to the inside of the hose, forcing the rubber against the  cotton cover, finishing the cure and fixing it firmly in its place.      CORRUGATED MATTING.    After the mixing of the compound and the calendering, that is the  spreading it in sheets, the great roll of rubber and cloth that is to  be made into corrugated matting is sent to the pressman. Here it is  hung in a rack and fifteen or twenty feet of it drawn between the  plates of the huge hydraulic steam press. The bottom plate of this  press is grooved its whole length, so that when the upper platen is  let down the plain sheet of rubber is forced into the grooves and the  corrugations are formed. While in that position steam is let into the  upper and lower platens and the matting is cured. After it has been in  there the proper time, cold water is let into the press, it is cooled  off, and the upper platen being raised, it is ready to come out. A  simple device for loosening the matting from the grooves into which it  has been forced is a long steel rod, with a handle on one hand like an  auger handle, which, being introduced under the edge and twisted,  allows the air to enter with it and releases it from the mould.      PACKING.    Sheet packing is often times made in a press, like corrugated matting.  The varieties, however, known as gum core have to go through a  different process. Usually a core is squirted through a tube machine  and the outside covering of jute or cotton, or whatever the fabric may  be, is put on by a braider or is wrapped about it somewhat after the  manner of the old fashioned cloth-wrapped tubing. The fabric is either  treated with some heat-resisting mixture or something that is a  lubricant, plumbago and oil being the compound. Other packings are  made from the ends of belts cut out in a circular form and treated  with a lubricant. There are scores of styles that make special claims  for excellences that are made in a variety of ways, but as a rule the  general system as outlined above is followed.      JAR RINGS.    The old fashioned way of making jar rings was first to take a large  mandrel and wrap it around with a sheet of compounded rubber until the  thickness of the ring was secured. It was then held in place by a  further wrapping of cloth, vulcanized, put in a lathe and cut up into  rings by hand. That manner of procedure, however, was too slow, and it  is to-day done almost wholly by machinery. For example, the rubber is  squirted out of a mammoth tubing machine in the shape of a huge tube,  then slipped on a mandrel and vulcanized. It is then put in an  automatic lathe and revolving swiftly is brought against a sharp  knife blade which cuts ring after ring until the whole is consumed,  without any handling or watching.--_India Rubber World_.           *       *       *       *       *          HOW ENAMELED LETTERS ARE MADE.      The following is a description of a brief visit by a representative of  the _Journal of Decorative Art_ to the new factory of the Patent  Letter and Enamel Company, Ltd., situate in the East End of London.    The company have recently secured a large freehold plot in the center  of the East End of London, and have built for themselves a most  commodious and spacious factory, some hundreds of feet in length, all  on one floor, and commanded from one end by the manager's office, from  whence can be seen at a glance the entire premises.    The works are divided into two large compartments, and are lighted  from the roof, ample provision being made for ventilation, and  attention being given to those sanitary conditions which are, or  should be, imperative on all well managed establishments.    We first explore the stockroom. Here are stored the numerous dies, of  all sizes and shapes, which the company possess, varying in size from  half an inch to twelve or sixteen inches. Here, too, is kept the large  store of thin sheet copper out of which the letters are stamped. Our  readers are familiar with the form or principle upon which these  letters are made. It is simply a convex surface, the reverse side  being concave, and being fixed on to the glass or other material with  a white lead preparation. When these letters were first made, the  practice was to cut or stamp them out in flat copper, and then to  round or mould them by a second operation. Recent improvements in the  machinery, however, have dispensed with this dual process, and the  stamping and moulding is done in the one swift, sharp operation.    The process of making an enameled letter has four stages--stamping,  enameling, firing, and filing. There are other and subsequent  processes for elaborating, but those named are of the essence of the  transaction.      STAMPING.    The stamping is done by means of presses, and is a very rapid and  complete operation.    The operator takes a piece of the sheet copper, places it on the  press, the lever descends, there is a sharp crunching, bursting sound,  and in a time shorter than it has taken to describe, the letter is  made, sharp and perfect in every way.      ENAMELING.    The letters are now taken charge of by a girl, who lays them out on a  wire tray, the hollow side up, and paints them over with a thin  mordant. While they are in this position, and before the mordant  dries, they are taken on the gridiron-like tray to a kind of large  box, which is full of the powdered enamel, and,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#20)"],[1,"-may be kept for seven days at -190 deg.C. without their  vitality being modified. Phosphorescent organisms cease, it is true,  to shine at the temperature of liquid air, but this fact is simply due  to the oxidations and other chemical reactions which keep up the  phosphorescence being then suspended, for phosphorescent activity  reappears so soon as the temperature is again sufficiently raised. An  important conclusion has been drawn from these experiments which  affects cosmogonical theories: since the cold of space could not kill  the germs of life, it is in no way absurd to suppose that, under  proper conditions, a germ may be transmitted from one planet to  another.    Among the discoveries made with the new processes, the one which most  strikingly interested public attention is that of new gases in the  atmosphere. We know how Sir William Ramsay and Dr. Travers first  observed by means of the spectroscope the characteristics of the  _companions_ of argon in the least volatile part of the atmosphere.  Sir James Dewar on the one hand, and Sir William Ramsay on the other,  subsequently separated in addition to argon and helium, crypton,  xenon, and neon. The process employed consists essentially in first  solidifying the least volatile part of the air and then causing it to  evaporate with extreme slowness. A tube with electrodes enables the  spectrum of the gas in process of distillation to be observed. In this  manner, the spectra of the various gases may be seen following one  another in the inverse order of their volatility. All these gases are  monoatomic, like mercury; that is to say, they are in the most simple  state, they possess no internal molecular energy (unless it is that  which heat is capable of supplying), and they even seem to have no  chemical energy. Everything leads to the belief that they show the  existence on the earth of an earlier state of things now vanished. It  may be supposed, for instance, that helium and neon, of which the  molecular mass is very slight, were formerly more abundant on our  planet; but at an epoch when the temperature of the globe was higher,  the very speed of their molecules may have reached a considerable  value, exceeding, for instance, eleven kilometres per second, which  suffices to explain why they should have left our atmosphere. Crypton  and neon, which have a density four times greater than oxygen, may, on  the contrary, have partly disappeared by solution at the bottom of the  sea, where it is not absurd to suppose that considerable quantities  would be found liquefied at great depths.[10]    [Footnote 10: Another view, viz. that these inert gases are a kind of  waste product of radioactive changes, is also gaining ground. The  discovery of the radioactive mineral malacone, which gives off both  helium and argon, goes to support this. See Messrs Ketchin and  Winterson's paper on the subject at the Chemical Society, 18th October  1906.--ED.]    It is probable, moreover, that the higher regions of the atmosphere  are not composed of the same air as that around us. Sir James Dewar  points out that Dalton's law demands that every gas composing the  atmosphere should have, at all heights and temperatures, the same  pressure as if it were alone, the pressure decreasing the less  quickly, all things being equal, as its density becomes less. It  results from this that the temperature becoming gradually lower as we  rise in the atmosphere, at a certain altitude there can no longer  remain any traces of oxygen or nitrogen, which no doubt liquefy, and  the atmosphere must be almost exclusively composed of the most  volatile gases, including hydrogen, which M.A. Gautier has, like Lord  Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay, proved to exist in the air. The  spectrum of the _Aurora borealis_, in which are found the lines of  those parts of the atmosphere which cannot be liquefied in liquid  hydrogen, together with the lines of argon, crypton, and xenon, is  quite in conformity with this point of view. It is, however, singular  that it should be the spectrum of crypton, that is to say, of the  heaviest gas of the group, which appears most clearly in the upper  regions of the atmosphere.    Among the gases most difficult to liquefy, hydrogen has been the  object of particular research and of really quantitative experiments.  Its properties in a liquid state are now very clearly known. Its  boiling-point, measured with a helium thermometer which has been  compared with thermometers of oxygen and hydrogen, is -252 deg.; its  critical temperature is -241 deg. C.; its critical pressure, 15  atmospheres. It is four times lighter than water, it does not present  any absorption spectrum, and its specific heat is the greatest known.  It is not a conductor of electricity. Solidified at 15 deg. absolute, it  is far from reminding one by its aspect of a metal; it rather  resembles a piece of perfectly pure ice, and Dr Travers attributes to  it a crystalline structure. The last gas which has resisted  liquefaction, helium, has recently been obtained in a liquid state; it  appears to have its boiling-point in the neighbourhood of 6 deg.  absolute.[11]    [Footnote 11: M. Poincare is here in error. Helium has never been  liquefied.--ED.]      Sec. 3. SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS    The interest of the results to which the researches on the continuity  between the liquid and the gaseous states have led is so great, that  numbers of scholars have naturally been induced to inquire whether  something analogous might not be found in the case of liquids and  solids. We might think that a similar continuity ought to be there met  with, that the universal character of the properties of matter forbade  all real discontinuity between two different states, and that, in  truth, the solid was a prolongation of the liquid state.    To discover whether this supposition is correct, it concerns us to  compare the properties of liquids and solids. If we find that all  properties are common to the two states we have the right to believe,  even if they presented themselves in different degrees, that, by a  continuous series of intermediary bodies, the two classes might yet be  connected. If, on the other hand, we discover that there exists in  these two classes some quality of a different nature, we must  necessarily conclude that there is a discontinuity which nothing can  remove.    The distinction established, from the point of view of daily custom,  between solids and liquids, proceeds especially from the difficulty  that we meet with in the one case, and the facility in the other, when  we wish to change their form temporarily or permanently by the action  of mechanical force. This distinction only corresponds, however, in  reality, to a difference in the value of certain coefficients. It is  impossible to discover by this means any absolute characteristic which  establishes a separation between the two classes. Modern researches  prove this clearly. It is not without use, in order to well understand  them, to state precisely the meaning of a few terms generally rather  loosely employed.    If a conjunction of forces acting on a homogeneous material mass  happens to deform it without compressing or dilating it, two very  distinct kinds of reactions may appear which oppose themselves to the  effort exercised. During the time of deformation, and during that time  only, the first make their influence felt. They depend essentially on  the greater or less rapidity of the deformation, they cease with the  movement, and could not, in any case, bring the body back to its  pristine state of equilibrium. The existence of these reactions leads  us to the idea of viscosity or internal friction.    The second kind of reactions are of a different nature. They continue  to act when the deformation remains stationary, and, if the external  forces happen to disappear, they are capable of causing the body to  return to its initial form, provided a certain limit has not been  exceeded. These last constitute rigidity.    At first sight a solid body appears to have a finite rigidity and an  infinite viscosity; a liquid, on the contrary, presents a certain  viscosity, but no rigidity. But if we examine the matter more closely,  beginning either with the solids or with the liquids, we see this  distinction vanish.    Tresca showed long ago that internal friction is not infinite in a  solid; certain bodies can, so to speak, at once flow and be moulded.  M.W. Spring has given many examples of such phenomena. On the other  hand, viscosity in liquids is never non-existent; for were it so for  water, for example, in the celebrated experiment effected by Joule for  the determination of the mechanical equivalent of the caloric, the  liquid borne along by the floats would slide without friction on the  surrounding liquid, and the work done by movement would be the same  whether the floats did or did not plunge into the liquid mass.    In certain cases observed long ago with what are called pasty bodies,  this viscosity attains a value almost comparable to that observed by  M. Spring in some solids. Nor does rigidity allow us to establish a  barrier between the two states. Notwithstanding the extreme mobility  of their particles, liquids contain, in fact, vestiges of the property  which we formerly wished to consider the special characteristic of  solids.    Maxwell before succeeded in rendering the existence of this rigidity  very probable by examining the optical properties of a deformed layer  of liquid. But a Russian physicist, M. Schwedoff, has gone further,  and has been able by direct experiments to show that a sheath of  liquid set between two solid cylinders tends, when one of the  cylinders is subjected to a slight rotation, to return to its original  position, and gives a measurable torsion to a thread upholding the  cylinder. From the knowledge of this torsion the rigidity can be  deduced. In the case of a"]]]
