We are thus once more reminded of the distinction between essential or  unavoidable relational concepts and the dispensable type. The former are  universally expressed, the latter are but sparsely developed in some  languages, elaborated with a bewildering exuberance in others. But what  prevents us from throwing in these \"dispensable\" or \"secondary\"  relational concepts with the large, floating group of derivational,  qualifying concepts that we have already discussed? Is there, after all  is said and done, a fundamental difference between a qualifying concept  like the negative in _unhealthy_ and a relational one like the number  concept in _books_? If _unhealthy_ may be roughly paraphrased as _not  healthy_, may not _books_ be just as legitimately paraphrased, barring  the violence to English idiom, as _several book?_ There are, indeed,  languages in which the plural, if expressed at all, is conceived of in  the same sober, restricted, one might almost say casual, spirit in which  we feel the negative in _unhealthy_. For such languages the number  concept has no syntactic significance whatever, is not essentially  conceived of as defining a relation, but falls into the group of  derivational or even of basic concepts. In English, however, as in  French, German, Latin, Greek--indeed in all the languages that we have  most familiarity with--the idea of number is not merely appended to a  given concept of a thing. It may have something of this merely  qualifying value, but its force extends far beyond. It infects much else  in the sentence, molding other concepts, even such as have no  intelligible relation to number, into forms that are said to correspond  to or \"agree with\" the basic concept to which it is attached in the  first instance. If \"a man falls\" but \"men fall\" in English, it is not  because of any inherent change that has taken place in the nature of the  action or because the idea of plurality inherent in \"men\" must, in the  very nature of ideas, relate itself also to the action performed by  these men. What we are doing in these sentences is what most languages,  in greater or less degree and in a hundred varying ways, are in the  habit of doing--throwing a bold bridge between the two basically  distinct types of concept, the concrete and the abstractly relational,  infecting the latter, as it were, with the color and grossness of the  former. By a certain violence of metaphor the material concept is forced  to do duty for (or intertwine itself with) the strictly relational.    The case is even more obvious if we take gender as our text. In the two  English phrases, \"The white woman that comes\" and \"The white men that  come,\" we are not reminded that gender, as well as number, may be  elevated into a secondary relational concept. It would seem a little  far-fetched to make of masculinity and femininity, crassly material,  philosophically accidental concepts that they are, a means of relating  quality and person, person and action, nor would it easily occur to us,  if we had not studied the classics, that it was anything but absurd to  inject into two such highly attenuated relational concepts as are  expressed by \"the\" and \"that\" the combined notions of number and sex.  Yet all this, and more, happens in Latin. _Illa alba femina quae venit_  and _illi albi homines qui veniunt_, conceptually translated, amount to  this: _that_-one-feminine-doer[57] one-feminine-_white_-doer  feminine-doing-one-_woman_ _which_-one-feminine-doer  other[58]-one-now-_come_; and: _that_-several-masculine-doer  several-masculine-_white_-doer masculine-doing-several-_man_  _which_-several-masculine-doer other-several-now-_come_. Each word  involves no less than four concepts, a radical concept (either properly  concrete--_white_, _man_, _woman_, _come_--or demonstrative--_that_,  _which_) and three relational concepts, selected from the categories of  case, number, gender, person, and tense. Logically, only case[59] (the  relation of _woman_ or _men_ to a following verb, of _which_ to its  antecedent, of _that_ and _white_ to _woman_ or _men_, and of _which_ to  _come_) imperatively demands expression, and that only in connection  with the concepts directly affected (there is, for instance, no need to  be informed that the whiteness is a doing or doer's whiteness[60]). The  other relational concepts are either merely parasitic (gender  throughout; number in the demonstrative, the adjective, the relative,  and the verb) or irrelevant to the essential syntactic form of the  sentence (number in the noun; person; tense). An intelligent and  sensitive Chinaman, accustomed as he is to cut to the very bone of  linguistic form, might well say of the Latin sentence, \"How pedantically  imaginative!\" It must be difficult for him, when first confronted by the  illogical complexities of our European languages, to feel at home in an  attitude that so largely confounds the subject-matter of speech with its  formal pattern or, to be more accurate, that turns certain fundamentally  concrete concepts to such attenuated relational uses.    [Footnote 57: \"Doer,\" not \"done to.\" This is a necessarily clumsy tag to  represent the \"nominative\" (subjective) in contrast to the \"accusative\"  (objective).]    [Footnote 58: I.e., not you or I.]    [Footnote 59: By \"case\" is here meant not only the subjective-objective  relation but also that of attribution.]    [Footnote 60: Except in so far as Latin uses this method as a rather  awkward, roundabout method of establishing the attribution of the color  to the particular object or person. In effect one cannot in Latin  directly say that a person is white, merely that what is white is  identical with the person who is, acts, or is acted upon in such and  such a manner. In origin the feel of the Latin _illa alba femina_ is  really \"that-one, the-white-one, (namely) the-woman\"--three substantive  ideas that are related to each other by a juxtaposition intended to  convey an identity. English and Chinese express the attribution directly  by means of order. In Latin the _illa_ and _alba_ may occupy almost any  position in the sentence. It is important to observe that the subjective  form of _illa_ and _alba_, does not truly define a relation of these  qualifying concepts to _femina_. Such a relation might be formally  expressed _via_ an attributive case, say the genitive (_woman of  whiteness_). In Tibetan both the methods of order and of true case  relation may be employed: _woman white_ (i.e., \"white woman\") or  _white-of woman_ (i.e., \"woman of whiteness, woman who is white, white  woman\").]    I have exaggerated somewhat the concreteness of our subsidiary or rather  non-syntactical relational concepts In order that the essential facts  might come out in bold relief. It goes without saying that a Frenchman  has no clear sex notion in his mind when he speaks of _un arbre_  (\"a-masculine tree\") or of _une pomme_ (\"a-feminine apple\"). Nor have  we, despite the grammarians, a very vivid sense of the present as  contrasted with all past and all future time when we say _He comes_.[61]  This is evident from our use of the present to indicate both future time  (\"He comes to-morrow\") and general activity unspecified as to time  (\"Whenever he comes, I am glad to see him,\" where \"comes\" refers to past  occurrences and possible future ones rather than to present activity).  In both the French and English instances the primary ideas of sex and  time have become diluted by form-analogy and by extensions into the  relational sphere, the concepts ostensibly indicated being now so  vaguely delimited that it is rather the tyranny of usage than the need  of their concrete expression that sways us in the selection of this or  that form. If the thinning-out process continues long enough, we may  eventually be left with a system of forms on our hands from which all  the color of life has vanished and which merely persist by inertia,  duplicating each other's secondary, syntactic functions with endless  prodigality. Hence, in part, the complex conjugational systems of so  many languages, in which differences of form are attended by no  assignable differences of function. There must have been a time, for  instance, though it antedates our earliest documentary evidence, when  the type of tense formation represented by _drove_ or _sank_ differed in  meaning, in however slightly nuanced a degree, from the type (_killed_,  _worked_) which has now become established in English as the prevailing  preterit formation, very much as we recognize a valuable distinction at  present between both these types and the \"perfect\" (_has driven, has  killed_) but may have ceased to do so at some point in the future.[62]  Now form lives longer than its own conceptual content. Both are  ceaselessly changing, but, on the whole, the form tends to linger on  when the spirit has flown or changed its being. Irrational form, form  for form's sake--however we term this tendency to hold on to formal  distinctions once they have come to be--is as natural to the life of  language as is the retention of modes of conduct that have long outlived  the meaning they once had.    [Footnote 61: Aside, naturally, from the life and imminence that may be  created for such a sentence by a particular context.]    [Footnote 62: This has largely happened in popular French and German,  where the difference is stylistic rather than functional. The preterits  are more literary or formal in tone than the perfects.]    There is another powerful tendency which makes for a formal elaboration  that does not strictly correspond to clear-cut conceptual differences.  This is the tendency to construct schemes of classification into which  all the concepts of language must be fitted. Once we have made up our  minds that all things are either definitely good or bad or definitely "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#20)"],[1,"  once more in the royal residence, was determined to work with as  wholehearted a detachment for the Prince's benefit as, more than twenty  years before, he had worked for his uncle's. The situations then and  now, similar in many respects, were yet full of differences. Perhaps in  either case the difficulties to be encountered were equally great; but  the present problem was the more complex and the more interesting. The  young doctor who, unknown and insignificant, had nothing at the back of  him but his own wits and the friendship of an unimportant Prince, had  been replaced by the accomplished confidant of kings and ministers, ripe  in years, in reputation, and in the wisdom of a vast experience. It  was possible for him to treat Albert with something of the affectionate  authority of a father; but, on the other hand, Albert was no Leopold.  As the Baron was very well aware, he had none of his uncle's rigidity of  ambition, none of his overweening impulse to be personally great. He was  virtuous and well-intentioned; he was clever and well-informed; but he  took no interest in politics, and there were no signs that he possessed  any commanding force of character. Left to himself, he would almost  certainly have subsided into a high-minded nonentity, an aimless  dilettante busy over culture, a palace appendage without influence or  power. But he was not left to himself: Stockmar saw to that. For ever  at his pupil's elbow, the hidden Baron pushed him forward, with tireless  pressure, along the path which had been trod by Leopold so many years  ago. But, this time, the goal at the end of it was something more than  the mediocre royalty that Leopold had reached. The prize which Stockmar,  with all the energy of disinterested devotion, had determined should be  Albert's was a tremendous prize indeed.    The beginning of the undertaking proved to be the most arduous part  of it. Albert was easily dispirited: what was the use of struggling to  perform in a role which bored him and which, it was quite clear, nobody  but the dear good Baron had any desire that he should take up? It was  simpler, and it saved a great deal of trouble, to let things slide.  But Stockmar would not have it. Incessantly, he harped upon two  strings--Albert's sense of duty and his personal pride. Had the Prince  forgotten the noble aims to which his life was to be devoted? And was he  going to allow himself, his wife, his family, his whole existence, to be  governed by Baroness Lehzen? The latter consideration was a potent one.  Albert had never been accustomed to giving way; and now, more than ever  before, it would be humiliating to do so. Not only was he constantly  exasperated by the position of the Baroness in the royal household;  there was another and a still more serious cause of complaint. He was,  he knew very well, his wife's intellectual superior, and yet he found,  to his intense annoyance, that there were parts of her mind over which  he exercised no influence. When, urged on by the Baron, he attempted  to discuss politics with Victoria, she eluded the subject, drifted into  generalities, and then began to talk of something else. She was treating  him as she had once treated their uncle Leopold. When at last he  protested, she replied that her conduct was merely the result of  indolence; that when she was with him she could not bear to bother her  head with anything so dull as politics. The excuse was worse than the  fault: was he the wife and she the husband? It almost seemed so. But the  Baron declared that the root of the mischief was Lehzen: that it was she  who encouraged the Queen to have secrets; who did worse--undermined  the natural ingenuousness of Victoria, and induced her to give,  unconsciously no doubt, false reasons to explain away her conduct.    Minor disagreements made matters worse. The royal couple differed in  their tastes. Albert, brought up in a regime of Spartan simplicity and  early hours, found the great Court functions intolerably wearisome,  and was invariably observed to be nodding on the sofa at half-past ten;  while the Queen's favourite form of enjoyment was to dance through the  night, and then, going out into the portico of the Palace, watch the sun  rise behind St. Paul's and the towers of Westminster. She loved London  and he detested it. It was only in Windsor that he felt he could really  breathe; but Windsor too had its terrors: though during the day there  he could paint and walk and play on the piano, after dinner black tedium  descended like a pall. He would have liked to summon distinguished  scientific and literary men to his presence, and after ascertaining  their views upon various points of art and learning, to set forth his  own; but unfortunately Victoria \"had no fancy to encourage such people;\"  knowing that she was unequal to taking a part in their conversation,  she insisted that the evening routine should remain unaltered; the  regulation interchange of platitudes with official persons was followed  as usual by the round table and the books of engravings, while the  Prince, with one of his attendants, played game after game of double  chess.    It was only natural that in so peculiar a situation, in which the  elements of power, passion, and pride were so strangely apportioned,  there should have been occasionally something more than mere  irritation--a struggle of angry wills. Victoria, no more than Albert,  was in the habit of playing second fiddle. Her arbitrary temper flashed  out. Her vitality, her obstinacy, her overweening sense of her own  position, might well have beaten down before them his superiorities and  his rights. But she fought at a disadvantage; she was, in very truth, no  longer her own mistress; a profound preoccupation dominated her, seizing  upon her inmost purposes for its own extraordinary ends. She was madly  in love. The details of those curious battles are unknown to us; but  Prince Ernest, who remained in England with his brother for some  months, noted them with a friendly and startled eye. One story, indeed,  survives, ill-authenticated and perhaps mythical, yet summing up, as  such stories often do, the central facts of the case. When, in wrath,  the Prince one day had locked himself into his room, Victoria, no less  furious, knocked on the door to be admitted. \"Who is there?\" he asked.  \"The Queen of England\" was the answer. He did not move, and again there  was a hail of knocks. The question and the answer were repeated many  times; but at last there was a pause, and then a gentler knocking. \"Who  is there?\" came once more the relentless question. But this time the  reply was different. \"Your wife, Albert.\" And the door was immediately  opened.    Very gradually the Prince's position changed. He began to find the study  of politics less uninteresting than he had supposed; he read Blackstone,  and took lessons in English Law; he was occasionally present when the  Queen interviewed her Ministers; and at Lord Melbourne's suggestion he  was shown all the despatches relating to Foreign Affairs. Sometimes  he would commit his views to paper, and read them aloud to the Prime  Minister, who, infinitely kind and courteous, listened with attention,  but seldom made any reply. An important step was taken when, before  the birth of the Princess Royal, the Prince, without any opposition  in Parliament, was appointed Regent in case of the death of the Queen.  Stockmar, owing to whose intervention with the Tories this happy result  had been brought about, now felt himself at liberty to take a holiday  with his family in Coburg; but his solicitude, poured out in innumerable  letters, still watched over his pupil from afar. \"Dear Prince,\" he  wrote, \"I am satisfied with the news you have sent me. Mistakes,  misunderstandings, obstructions, which come in vexatious opposition  to one's views, are always to be taken for just what they are--namely,  natural phenomena of life, which represent one of its sides, and  that the shady one. In overcoming them with dignity, your mind has to  exercise, to train, to enlighten itself; and your character to gain  force, endurance, and the necessary hardness.\" The Prince had done well  so far; but he must continue in the right path; above all, he was \"never  to relax.\" \"Never to relax in putting your magnanimity to the proof;  never to relax in logical separation of what is great and essential from  what is trivial and of no moment; never to relax in keeping yourself  up to a high standard--in the determination, daily renewed, to be  consistent, patient, courageous.\" It was a hard programme perhaps, for a  young man of twenty-one; and yet there was something in it which touched  the very depths of Albert's soul. He sighed, but he listened--listened  as to the voice of a spiritual director inspired with divine truth. \"The  stars which are needful to you now,\" the voice continued, \"and perhaps  for some time to come, are Love, Honesty, Truth. All those whose minds  are warped, or who are destitute of true feeling, will BE APT TO MISTAKE  YOU, and to persuade themselves and the world that you are not the man  you are--or, at least, may become... Do you, therefore, be on the alert  be times, with your eyes open in every direction... I wish for my Prince  a great, noble, warm, and true heart, such as shall serve as the richest  and surest basis for the noblest views of human nature, and the firmest  resolve to give them development.\"    Before long, the decisive moment came. There was a General Election, and  it became certain that the Tories, at last, must come into power. The  Queen disliked them as much as ever; but, with a large majority in the  House of Commons, they would now be in a position to insist upon their  wishes being attended to. Lord Melbourne himself was the first to  realise the importance of carrying out the inevitable transition with as  little friction as possible; and with his consent, the Prince,"]]]
