No doubt to many of us the privation thus imposed would  be far worse than the privation of small change, of horses and motor  cars, of express trains, and all the other prosaic inconveniences of  war. But would it be worse than the privation of faith, and the horror  of the soul, wrought by the spectacle of nations praying to their common  Father to assist them in sabring and bayonetting and blowing one another  to pieces with explosives that are also corrosives, and of the Church  organizing this monstrous paradox instead of protesting against it?  Would it make less atheists or more? Atheism is not a simple homogeneous  phenomenon. There is the youthful atheism with which every able modern  mind begins: an atheism that clears the soul of superstitions and  terrors and servilities and base compliances and hypocrisies, and lets  in the light of heaven. And there is the atheism of despair and  pessimism: the sullen cry with which so many of us at this moment,  looking on blinded deafened maimed wrecks that were once able-bodied  admirable lovable men, and on priests blessing war, and newspapers and  statesmen and exempt old men hounding young men on to it, are saying \"I  know now there is no God.\" What has the Church in its present attitude  to set against this crushed acceptance of darkness except the quaint but  awful fact that there are cruder people on whom horrifying calamities  have just the opposite effect, because they seem the work of some power  so overwhelming in its malignity that it must be worshipped because it  is mighty? Let the Church beware how it plays to that gallery. If all  the Churches of Europe closed their doors until the drums ceased rolling  they would act as a most powerful reminder that though the glory of war  is a famous and ancient glory, it is not the final glory of God.    But as I know quite well that the Churches are not going to do anything  of the kind, I must not close on a note which might to some readers  imply that I hope, as some highly respected friends of mine do, to build  a pacific civilization on the ruins of the vast ecclesiastical  organizations which have never yet been able to utter the truth, because  they have had to speak to the poor according to their ignorance and  credulity, and to the rich according to their power. When I read that  the icon of the Russian peasant is a religious force that will prevail  over the materialism of Helmholtz and Haeckel, I have to contain myself  as best I can in the face of an assumption by a modern educated European  which implies that the Irish peasants who tied scraps of rag to the  trees over their holy wells and paid for masses to shorten the stay of  their dead relatives in purgatory, were more enlightened than their  countryman Tyndall, the Lucretian materialist, and to ask whether the  Russian peasant may not find his religious opinions somewhat neutralized  by his alliance with the countries of Paul Bert and Combes, of Darwin  and Almroth Wright. If we are to keep up any decent show of talking  sense on this point we must begin by recognizing that the lines of  battle in this war cut right across all the political and sectarian  lines in Europe, except the line between our Socialist future and our  Commercialist past. Materialist France, metaphysical Germany,  muddle-headed English, Byzantine Russia may form what military  combinations they please: the one thing they cannot form is a Crusade;  and all attempts to represent this war as anything higher or more  significant philosophically or politically or religiously for our  Junkers and our Tommies than a quite simple primitive contest of the  pugnacity that bullies and the pugnacity that will not be bullied are  foredoomed to the derision of history. However far-reaching the  consequences of the war may be, we in England are fighting to shew the  Prussians that they shall not trample on us nor on our neighbors if we  can help it, and that if they are fools enough to make their fighting  efficiency the test of civilization, we can play that game as  destructively as they. That is simple, and the truth, and by far the  jolliest and most inspiring ground to recruit on. It stirs the blood and  stiffens the back as effectively and quickly as hypocrisy and cant and  humbug sour and trouble and discourage. But it will not carry us farther  than the end of the fight. We cannot go on fighting forever, or even for  very long, whatever Lord Kitchener may think; and win, lose, or tie, the  parties, when the fight is over, must fall back on their civil wisdom  and political foresight for a settlement of the terms on which we are to  live happily together ever after. The practicable conditions of a stable  comity of nations cannot be established by the bayonet, which settles  nothing but the hash of those who rely on it. They are to found, as I  have already explained, in the substitution for our present Militarist  kingdoms of a system of democratic units delimited by community of  language, religion, and habit; grouped in federations of united States  when their extent makes them politically unwieldy; and held against war  by the bond of international Socialism, the only ground upon which the  identity of interest between all workers never becomes obscured.      *The Death of Jaures.*    By far the greatest calamity wrought by the war has been the death of  Jaures, who was worth more to France and to Europe than ten army corps  and a hundred Archdukes. I once proposed a press law that might have  saved him. It was that every article printed in a newspaper should bear  not only the name and address of the writer, but the sum paid him for  the contribution. If the wretched dupe who assassinated Jaures had known  that the trashy articles on the Three Years Law he had been reading were  not the voice of France in peril, but the ignorant scribbling of some  poor devil at his wits' end to earn three francs, he would hardly have  thrown away his own life to take that of the greatest statesman his  country has produced since Mirabeau. It is hardly too much to say that  this ghastly murder and the appalling war that almost eclipsed its  horror, is the revenge of the sweated journalist on a society so silly  that though it will not allow a man to stuff its teeth without  ascertained qualifications for the task, it allows anyone, no matter how  poor, how ignorant, how untrained, how imbecile, to stuff its brains  without even taking the trouble to ask his name. When we interfere with  him and his sweaters at all, we interfere by way of appointing a  censorship to prevent him from telling, not lies, however mischievous  and dangerous to our own people abroad, but the truth. To be a liar and  a brewer of bad blood is to be a privileged person under our censorship,  which, so far, has proceeded by no discoverable rule except that of  concealing from us everything that the Germans must know lest the  Germans should find it out.      *Socialism Alone Keeps Its Head.*    Socialism has lost its leader on the Continent; but it is solid and  representative on the main point; it loathes war; and it sees clearly  that war is always waged by working men who have no quarrel, but on the  contrary a supreme common interest. It steadily resists the dangerous  export of capital by pressing the need for uncommercial employment of  capital at home: the only practicable alternative. It knows that war, on  its romantic side, is \"the sport of kings\": and it concludes that we had  better get rid of kings unless they can kill their tedium with more  democratic amusements. It notes the fact that though the newspapers  shout at us that these battles on fronts a hundred miles long, where the  slain outnumber the total forces engaged in older campaigns, are the  greatest battles known to history, such machine-carnages bore us so  horribly that we are ashamed of our ingratitude to our soldiers in not  being able to feel about them as about comparatively trumpery scraps  like Waterloo or even Inkerman and Balaclava. It never forgets that as  long as higher education, culture, foreign travel, knowledge of the  world: in short, the qualification for comprehension of foreign affairs  and intelligent voting, is confined to one small class, leaving the  masses in poverty, narrowness, and ignorance, and being itself  artificially cut off at their expense from the salutary pressure of the  common burden which alone keeps men unspoilt and sane, so long will that  small class be forced to obtain the support of the masses for its wars  by flattering proclamations of the national virtues and indignant  denunciations of the villanies of the enemy, with, if necessary, a  stiffening of deliberate falsehood and a strenuous persecution of any  attempt at inconvenient truthtelling. Here there is no question of the  Junker being a monster. You must rule ignoramuses according to their  ignorance. The priest must work bogus miracles for them; the man of  science must offer them magical cures and prophylactics; the barrister  must win their verdict by sophistries, false pathos, and appeals to  their prejudices; the army and navy must dazzle them with pageants and  bands and thundering salvos and romantic tales; the king must cut  himself off from humanity and become an idol. There is no escape whilst  such classes exist. Mahomet, the boldest prophet that ever threw down  the gage of the singleness and supremacy of God to a fierce tribe of  warriors who worshipped stones as devotedly as we worship dukes and  millionaires, could not govern them by religious truth, and was forced  to fall back on revolting descriptions of hell and the day of judgment,  invented by him for the purpose. What else could he do if his people  were not to be abandoned to their own destruction?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#20)"],[1," out of him than that.    But to Ned, after the crowd had gone, the inventor said:    \"Ned, my boy, they used to say that necessity was the mother of  invention. Therefore a loaf of bread was considered the maternal parent  of the locomotive. I've got one that will beat that.\"    \"Whew!\" gasped Ned. \"How can you? I haven't got my breath back yet.\"    \"It is peril that is the mother of invention,\" Tom went on, still  jotting down his notes. \"Believe me! that jolt gave me a new idea--an  important idea. Suppose that operator at Half Way had been out back  somewhere, and had not seen or heard us flash by?\"    \"Well, suppose he had? What's the answer?\" sighed Ned.    \"Like enough we would have rammed something down here.\"    \"And I hardly understand even now why we didn't do just that,\" muttered  his chum, with a shake of his head.    \"Wake up, Ned! It's all over,\" laughed Tom. \"While it was happening I  admit I was guessing just as hard as you were about the finish. But--\"    \"Your recovery is better,\" grumbled his friend. \"I'm scared yet.\"    \"And it might happen again--\"    \"No--not--ever!\" exclaimed Ned. \"I shall never touch those controllers  again. I'll drive your airscout, or your fastest automobile, or  anything like that. But me and this electric locomotive have parted  company for good. Yes, sir!\"    \"All right. It wasn't your fault. It might happen to any  motor-engineer. And the very fact that it can happen has given me my  idea. I tell you that danger is the mother of invention.\"    \"As far as I am concerned, it can be father and grandparents into the  bargain,\" Ned declared, with a smile.    \"Wake up!\" cried his friend again. \"I have got a dandy idea. I wouldn't  have missed that trip for anything.\"    \"You are crazy,\" interrupted Ned. \"Suppose we had bumped something?\"    \"But we didn't bump anything, except my brain tank. An idea bumped it,  I tell you. I am going to eliminate any such peril as that here-after.\"    \"You mean you are going to make it impossible for this locomotive ever  to slide down such a hill again if the brakes won't work? Humph!  Meanwhile I will go out and make the nearest water-fall begin to run  upward.\"    \"Don't scoff. I do not mean just what you mean.\"    \"I bet you don't!\"    \"But although I cannot be sure that a locomotive will never again fall  downhill,\" said Tom patiently, \"I'm going to fix it so that warning  need not be given by some operator along the line.  The engineer must  be able to send warning of his accident, both up and down the road.\"    \"Huh? How are you going to do that?\" demanded Ned.    \"Wireless telephone. I may make some improvements on the present  models; but it is practicable. It has been used on submarines and  cruisers, and lately its practicability has been proved in the forestry  service.    \"Every one of these electric locomotives I turn out will be supplied  with wireless sets. The expense of making certain telegraph offices  along the line into receiving stations will be small. I am going to  take that up with Mr. Bartholomew at once.  And I am going to fix these  brake controls so that nobody need ball them up again.\"    If, out of such a desperate adventure, Tom could bring to fruition  really worthwhile improvements in relation to his invention, Ned  acknowledged the value of the incident. Just the same, he had a  personal objection to having any part in a similar experience.    He was brave, but he could not forget danger. Tom seemed to throw the  effect of that terrible ride off his mind almost instantly. Ned dreamed  of it at night!    However, from that time things seemed to go with a rush.  Mr.  Bartholomew approved of the young inventor's suggestion regarding the  use of the wireless telephone as a method of averting a certain quality  of danger in the use of the proposed monster locomotive. The railroad  man was convinced that Tom's ideas were finally to culminate in  success, and he was ready to spend money, much money, in pushing on the  work.    It was not long before a private test of the Hercules 0001 up the grade  from Hammon to Cliff City showed Mr. Bartholomew that the speed he had  required in his contract was attainable. With a drag fully as heavy as  any two locomotives had been able to get over the same sector, the new  locomotive alone marked a forty-five mile an hour pace.    This attainment was kept quiet; not even the train crew knew what the  monster had done when they reached the summit of the mountain. But Mr.  Bartholomew, who rode with Tom and Ned in the cab, had held his own  watch on the test and compared it every minute with the speedometer.    \"I am satisfied that you are going to do more than I had really hoped,  Mr. Swift,\" the railroad president said at the end of the run. \"Already  you could drive this locomotive at a two-mile-a-minute clip on level  rails, I am sure. Keep at it! Nobody will be more delighted than I  shall be if you pull down that hundred thousand dollars' bonus.\"    \"That's a fine way to talk, sir,\" cried Ned, with enthusiasm.    \"I mean every word of it, Mr. Newton. The money is his as soon as he  makes good.\"    Both Tom and his financial manager left the president's office in a  satisfied state of mind.    \"Great news to send home, Tom,\" remarked Ned, when they were alone.    \"Righto, Ned. My father will be glad to hear it.\"    \"And what about Mary?\" And Ned poked his chum in the ribs.    \"I guess she'll be glad too,\" Tom replied, his face reddening.    That night Tom sent word to Mary and also a telegram, in code, to his  father, saying the prospects were now bright for a quick finish of the  task that had brought him West.          Chapter XXI    The Open Switch      Meanwhile the work of electrifying another division of the Hendrickton  & Pas Alos Railroad had been pushed to completion. As Mr. Bartholomew  had in the first place stated, the road controlled water rights in the  hills which would supply any number of electric power stations, and his  enemies could not shut his road off from these waterfalls.    Tom had not warned his faithful servant, the giant Koku, to watch out  for Andy O'Malley in particular; the inventor knew that the giant would  be as cautious about any stranger as could be wished. But personally  Tom was amazed that either O'Malley or some other henchman of the  president of the Hendrickton & Western did not make an attempt to  injure the electric locomotive.    \"Perhaps Mr. Bartholomew's police are really of some good,\" said Ned  Newton, when his chum mentioned his surprise on this point. \"Has Koku  seen nobody lurking about at night?\"    \"He certainly has not seen the man he calls 'Big Feet,'\" chuckled Tom.  \"If he had spotted O'Malley, there certainly would have been an  explosion.\"    \"Tell you what,\" Ned said reflectively, \"the longer Lewis keeps off  you, the more suspicious I should be.\"    \"You think he is a bad citizen, do you?\"    \"And then some, as the boys say out here,\" replied Ned. \"I wouldn't  trust that man any farther than I would a nest of hornets or a shedding  rattlesnake.\"    \"I am inclined to believe, with you, Ned, that Lewis is hatching up  something and is keeping mighty whist about it. I sounded Mr.  Bartholomew on the idea and he, too, is puzzled.\"    \"I guess he knows that hombre,\" grumbled Ned.    \"Mr. Bartholomew admits that several roads have sent representatives to  make inquiries about my locomotive. They have got wind of it, and,  after all, most railroads work in unison.  What means progress for one  is progress for all.\"    \"That same rule does not seem to apply in the case of the H. & P. A.  and the H. & W.,\" remarked Ned.    \"No. They are out and out rivals. And Lewis and his gang have done this  road dirt--no two ways about that. But when I am convinced that my  locomotive has got all the speed and power contracted for, Mr.  Bartholomew wants to invite a bunch of his brother railroaders to see  the tests--to ride in the Hercules Three-Oughts-One, in fact.\"    \"How about it? You going to agree? Suppose they have some inventive  sharp along who will be able to steal some of your mechanical  contrivances--in his head, I mean,\" and Ned seemed quite suddenly  anxious.    \"I had thought of that. But before the test I shall send my blueprints  to Washington. Our patent attorney there has already filed tentative  plans and applied for certain patents that I consider completed. Don't  fret. I'll make it impossible for anybody to steal our patents legally.\"    \"Yes! But illegally?\"    \"That we cannot help in any case, and you know it,\" Tom said.  \"If some  road tries to build anything like the Hercules Three-Oughts-One for the  first two years without arranging with the Swift Construction Company,  you know that that railroad can be made to suffer in the courts, and  you are the boy, Ned, to put them over the jumps for it.\"    \"Sure,\" grumbled his chum. \"It's always up to me to save the day.\"    \"Exactly,\" chuckled Tom. \"And in your character of life saver, do look  out for anybody who looks suspicious hanging about the Hercules  Three-Oughts-One. I'll take care of rival inventors. You and Koku keep  your eyes peeled for the H. & W. spies. Especially for that Andy  O'Malley. I feel that he will again show up. Maybe by 'the pricking of  my thumb' as Macbeth's witch used to remark.\"    Every day save Sunday the electric locomotive had some kind of try-out.  On a level track Tom was sure of his monster invention's qualities; but  in the hills, at a distance from the Hendrickton terminal, it was  another matter.    The grades were steep; but the road was well ballasted. There was  plenty of power. He saw the Jandel locomotives hurry back and forth  with the local trains and realized that this rival invention was by no  means to be despised.    It was at about this time, too, that Mr. Damon appeared in Hendrickton.  Early one forenoon, when Tom and Ned were preparing to take the  Hercules 0001 out of the yard, and Koku was going "]]]
