In Rev. i. 8,       the best MSS. read _ego eimi to alpha kai to o_.    33     The words _vulnerum piamina_ are generally supposed to refer to       the \"gifts which Moses commanded\" to be offered by those healed of       leprosy (Lev. xiv. 2). If so, Prudentius' language may imply that       the cure was not actually complete until the offering of these gifts,       and is at variance with St. Matthew, viii. 43, \"and forthwith his       leprosy was cleansed.\" Probably, however, his idea is rather that       the gifts to the priest formally marked the leper as a clean man.    71     Cf. note on iii. 199.                                       X    1     Parts of this hymn are used in the Moz. Brev. in the Office of the       Dead, being ll. 1-16, 45-48, 57-68, 157-168.         The burial rites of the primitive Church were simple, and marked by       an absence of the ostentatious expression of grief which the pagan       peoples displayed. The general practice of cremation was rejected,       partly owing to the new belief in the resurrection of the body, and       partly from a desire to imitate the burial of the Lord. At Rome,       during the first three centuries, the dead were laid in the       Catacombs, in which Prudentius took conspicuous interest (see       Translator's Note), but after 338 A.D. this practice became less       frequent, and was completely abandoned after 410 A.D. Elsewhere,       from the earliest times, the Christians purchased special enclosures       (_areae_), which were often attacked and rifled by angry mobs in the       days of persecution. The body was frequently embalmed (_cf._ ll. 51,       52), swathed in white linen (l. 49), and placed in a coffin; vigils       and hymns continued for three or four days, but hired mourners were       forbidden (l. 113), and instead of the dirges of the heathens,       chants expressive of triumphant faith were sung as the body was       carried to the grave, where a simple service was held, and evergreens       and flowers were strewn about the tomb (ll. 169, 170). The earliest       inscriptions are often roughly scratched on plaster, and consist       merely of a name and age, or simple words like--              GEMELLA DORMIT IN PACE         but later (cf. l. 171), they were engraved on small marble slabs.    25     In both thought and language this stanza, as vii. 16 _et seq._, is       evidently reminiscent of Horace (_Sat._ 2, ii. 77): _Quin corpus       onustum_, etc.              \"The Body, too, with Yesterday's excess            Burthened and tired, shall the pure Soul depress,            Weigh down this Portion of celestial Birth,            This Breath of God, and fix it to the Earth.\"                          (Francis).    51     Boldetti, in his work on the Catacombs (lib. i. cap. 59), says       that on many occasions, when he was present at the opening of a       grave, the assembled company were conscious of a spicy odour       diffusing itself from the tomb. Cf. Tertullian (_Apol._ 42): \"The       Arabs and Sabaeans knew well that we consume more of their precious       merchandise for our dead than do the heathen for their gods.\"    57     Prudentius' firm faith in the resurrection of the body is also       nobly expressed in the _Apotheosis_ (ll. 1063 _et seq._):--              \"_Nosco meum in Christo corpus resurgere; quid me            Desperare iubes? veniam, quibus ille revenit            Calcata de morte viis: quod credimus hoc est._                *       *       *       *       *              _Pellite corde metum, mea membra, et credite vosmet            Cum Christo reditura Deo; nam vos gerit ille            Et secum revocat: morbos ridete minaces:            Inflictos casus contemnite; tetra sepulcra            Despuite; exsurgens quo Christus provocat, ite._\"                             _Translation._              \"I know in Christ my body shall arise;            Why bid me, then, despair? for I shall go            By that same path whereby my Lord returned,            Death trodden 'neath His feet: this is my creed.            Banish, my limbs, all terror; and believe            That ye with Christ our God shall yet return;            He beareth you and with Himself recalls.            Laugh at the threats of sickness; scorn the blows            Of fate; despise the horrors of the tomb;            And fare ye where the risen Christ doth call.\"    61     The poet expresses as a duty owed to Christ Himself the heathen       obligation of casting three handfuls of earth upon a body discovered       dead.    69     For the incident referred to in these lines, see the Apocryphal       book of Tobias, cc. ii. and xi. Tobit, a pious Israelite captive       in Nineveh, was reduced to beggary as the result of his zeal in       burying those of his countrymen who had been killed and exposed by       royal command. He also lost his sight, which was eventually restored       by the application of the gall of a fish which attacked his son       Tobias, and was killed by him. The \"fish\" of the legend is probably       the crocodile, whose gall was credited with medicinal properties by       various Greek and Latin writers. Cf. Pliny, _N. H._ xxviii. 8: \"They       say that nothing avails more against cataract than to anoint the eyes       with its gall mixed with honey.\"    113     Cf. Cyprian (_De Mortal._ 20): \"We must not lament our brethren       whom the Lord's summons has freed from the world, for we know that       they are not lost, but gone before. We may not wear the black robes       of mourning while they have put on the white raiment of joy. Nor       may we grieve for those as lost whom we know to be living with God.\"    171     Cf. _Perist._ vii.:--              \"_Nos pio fletu, date, perluamus            Marmorum sulcos._\"         The early Christian epitaphs, of which many thousands exist, are       instinct with a faith which is in striking contrast to the unrelieved       gloom or sullen resignation of paganism. We may compare with the       common              AVE ATQVE VALE              \"Hail and farewell\"         or inscriptions like              INFANTI DVLCISSIMO QVEM DI IRATI AETERNO SOMNO DEDERUNT              \"To a very sweet babe, whom the angry gods gave to unending            sleep.\"         the Christian             DVLCIS ET INNOCENS HIC DORMIT SEVERIANVS SOMNO PACIS CVIVS           SPIRITVS IN LVCE DOMINI SVSCEPTVS EST   (A.D. 393)             \"Here slumbers in the sleep of peace the sweet and innocent           Severianus, whose spirit is received in the light of the Lord\"         or             NATVS EST LAVRENTIVS IN ETERNVM ANN.

He           sleeps in peace.\"         See also note on iii. 205.                                       XI    1     Virgil's Fourth Eclogue known as the \"Pollio\" has undoubtedly       influenced the thought and style of this poem: the more noticeable       parallels will be pointed out as they occur. In Milton's ode _On       the Morning of Christ's Nativity_ there are several passages which       recall Prudentius' treatment of the theme in this and the succeeding       hymn; but curiously enough, the Puritan poet in alluding to the       season of the Nativity takes an opposite line of thought, and       regards the diminished sunshine of winter as a veiling of an inferior       flame before the light of \"a greater Sun.\" Prudentius proclaims the       increase of the sun's light, which begins after the winter solstice,       as symbolic of the ever-widening influence of the True Light. The       idea is given in a terse form by St. Peter Chrysologus, _Serm._ 159:       _Crescere dies coepit, quia verus dies illuxit_. \"The day begins to       lengthen out, inasmuch as the true Day hath shone forth.\"    18     For the somewhat obscure phrase _verbo editus_, see note on iii. 2.    20     For \"Sophia\" or the Divine Creative Wisdom, see Prov. iii. 19, 20,       and especially viii. 27-31, where the language \"has been of signal       importance in the history of thought, helping, as it does, to make       a bridge between Eastern and Greek ideas, and to prepare the way       for the Incarnation\" (Davison, _Wisdom-Literature of the O. T._, pp.       5, 6). In Alexandrian theology the conception of God's transcendence       gave rise to the doctrine of an intermediate power or _logos_, by       which creation was effected. In the Prologue of the fourth Gospel       the idea was set forth in its purely Christian form. See 1, 3, where       the Logos or the pre-incarnate Christ is described as the maker of       all things--an idea which is also illustrated by the language of St.       Paul in such passages as Col. i. 6.    59     Cf. for the conception of a golden age, Virg., _Ecl._, iv. 5       _et seq._: _Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo_, etc.    65     Reminiscences of ancient prophecy appear to be embodied in this       and following lines. Cf. Joel iii. 18: \"And it shall come to pass       in that day that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine and the       hills shall flow with milk.\" Amos ix. 13: \"The mountains shall drop       sweet wine and all the hills shall melt.\" But cf. especially Virg.,       _Ecl._, iv. 18-30: _At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu_, etc.              \"Unbidden earth shall wreathing ivy bring,            And fragrant herbs (the promises of spring)            As her first off'rings to her infant king.                *       *       *       *       *              Unlaboured harvest shall the fields adorn,            And clustered grapes shall blush on every thorn;            The knotted oaks shall showers of honey weep,            And through the matted grass the liquid gold shall creep.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#20)"],[1,"wever, is first accomplished in the imagination,  and the sexual life of the maturing youth has hardly any escape except  indulgence in phantasies or ideas which are not destined to be brought  to execution. In the phantasies of all persons the infantile  inclinations, now reenforced by somatic emphasis, reappear, and among  them one finds in regular frequency and in the first place the sexual  feeling of the child for the parents. This has usually already been  differentiated by the sexual attraction, the attraction of the son for  the mother and of the daughter for the father.[10] Simultaneously with  the overcoming and rejection of these distinctly incestuous phantasies  there occurs one of the most important as well as one of the most  painful psychic accomplishments of puberty; it is the breaking away from  the parental authority, through which alone is formed that opposition  between the new and old generations which is so important for cultural  progress. Many persons are detained at each of the stations in the  course of development through which the individual must pass; and  accordingly there are persons who never overcome the parental authority  and never, or very imperfectly, withdraw their affection from their  parents. They are mostly girls, who, to the delight of their parents,  retain their full infantile love far beyond puberty, and it is  instructive to find that in their married life these girls are incapable  of fulfilling their duties to their husbands. They make cold wives and  remain sexually anesthetic. This shows that the apparently non-sexual  love for the parents and the sexual love are nourished from the same  source, _i.e._, that the first merely corresponds to an infantile  fixation of the libido.    The nearer we come to the deeper disturbances of the psychosexual  development the more easily we can recognize the evident significance of  the incestuous object-selection. As a result of sexual rejection there  remains in the unconscious of the psychoneurotic a great part or the  whole of the psychosexual activity for object finding. Girls with an  excessive need for affection and an equal horror for the real demands of  the sexual life experience an uncontrollable temptation on the one hand  to realize in life the ideal of the asexual love and on the other hand  to conceal their libido under an affection which they may manifest  without self reproach; this they do by clinging for life to the  infantile attraction for their parents or brothers or sisters which has  been repressed in puberty. With the help of the symptoms and other  morbid manifestations, psychoanalysis can trace their unconscious  thoughts and translate them into the conscious, and thus easily show to  such persons that they are in love with their consanguinous relations in  the popular meaning of the term. Likewise when a once healthy person  falls sick after an unhappy love affair, the mechanism of the disease  can distinctly be explained as a return of his libido to the persons  preferred in his infancy.    *The After Effects of the Infantile Object Selection.*--Even those who  have happily eluded the incestuous fixation of their libido have not  completely escaped its influence. It is a distinct echo of this phase of  development that the first serious love of the young man is often for a  mature woman and that of the girl for an older man equipped with  authority--_i.e._, for persons who can revive in them the picture of the  mother and father. Generally speaking object selection unquestionably  takes place by following more freely these prototypes. The man seeks  above all the memory picture of his mother as it has dominated him since  the beginning of childhood; this is quite consistent with the fact that  the mother, if still living, strives against this, her renewal, and  meets it with hostility. In view of this significance of the infantile  relation to the parents for the later selection of the sexual object, it  is easy to understand that every disturbance of this infantile relation  brings to a head the most serious results for the sexual life after  puberty. Jealousy of the lover, too, never lacks the infantile sources  or at least the infantile reinforcement. Quarrels between parents and  unhappy marital relations between the same determine the severest  predispositions for disturbed sexual development or neurotic diseases in  the children.    The infantile desire for the parents is, to be sure, the most important,  but not the only trace revived in puberty which points the way to the  object selection. Other dispositions of the same origin permit the man,  still supported by his infancy, to develop more than one single sexual  series and to form different determinations for the object  selection.[11]    *Prevention of Inversion.*--One of the tasks imposed in the object  selection consists in not missing the opposite sex. This, as we know, is  not solved without some difficulty. The first feelings after puberty  often enough go astray, though not with any permanent injury. Dessoir  has called attention to the normality of the enthusiastic friendships  formed by boys and girls with their own sex. The greatest force which  guards against a permanent inversion of the sexual object is surely the  attraction exerted by the opposite sex characters on each other. For  this we can give no explanation in connection with this discussion. This  factor, however, does not in itself suffice to exclude the inversion;  besides this there are surely many other supporting factors. Above all,  there is the authoritative inhibition of society; experience shows that  where the inversion is not considered a crime it fully corresponds to  the sexual inclinations of many persons. Moreover, it may be assumed  that in the man the infantile memories of the mother's tenderness, as  well as that of other females who cared for him as a child,  energetically assist in directing his selection to the woman, while the  early sexual intimidation experienced through the father and the  attitude of rivalry existing between them deflects the boy from the same  sex. Both factors also hold true in the case of the girl whose sexual  activity is under the special care of the mother. This results in a  hostile relation to the same sex which decisively influences the object  selection in the normal sense. The bringing up of boys by male persons  (slaves in the ancient times) seems to favor homosexuality; the  frequency of inversion in the present day nobility is probably explained  by their employment of male servants, and by the scant care that mothers  of that class give to their children. It happens in some hysterics that  one of the parents has disappeared (through death, divorce, or  estrangement), thus permitting the remaining parent to absorb all the  love of the child, and in this way establishing the determinations for  the sex of the person to be selected later as the sexual object; thus a  permanent inversion is made possible.      SUMMARY    It is now time to attempt a summing-up. We have started from the  aberrations of the sexual impulse in reference to its object and aim and  have encountered the question whether these originate from a congenital  predisposition, or whether they are acquired in consequence of  influences from life. The answer to this question was reached through an  examination of the relations of the sexual life of psychoneurotics, a  numerous group not very remote from the normal. This examination has  been made through psychoanalytic investigations. We have thus found that  a tendency to all perversions might be demonstrated in these persons in  the form of unconscious forces revealing themselves as symptom creators  and we could say that the neurosis is, as it were, the negative of the  perversion. In view of the now recognized great diffusion of tendencies  to perversion the idea forced itself upon us that the disposition to  perversions is the primitive and universal disposition of the human  sexual impulse, from which the normal sexual behavior develops in  consequence of organic changes and psychic inhibitions in the course of  maturity. We hoped to be able to demonstrate the original disposition in  the infantile life; among the forces restraining the direction of the  sexual impulse we have mentioned shame, loathing and sympathy, and the  social constructions of morality and authority. We have thus been forced  to perceive in every fixed aberration from the normal sexual life a  fragment of inhibited development and infantilism. The significance of  the variations of the original dispositions had to be put into the  foreground, but between them and the influences of life we had to assume  a relation of cooeperation and not of opposition. On the other hand, as  the original disposition must have been a complex one, the sexual  impulse itself appeared to us as something composed of many factors,  which in the perversions becomes separated, as it were, into its  components. The perversions, thus prove themselves to be on the one hand  inhibitions, and on the other dissociations from the normal development.  Both conceptions became united in the assumption that the sexual impulse  of the adult due to the composition of the diverse feelings of the  infantile life became formed into one unit, one striving, with one  single aim.    We also added an explanation for the preponderance of perversive  tendencies in the psychoneurotics by recognizing in these tendencies  collateral fillings of side branches caused by the shifting of the main  river bed through repression, and we then turned our examination to the  sexual life of the infantile period.[12] We found it regrettable that  the existence of a sexual life in infancy has been disputed, and that  the sexual manifestations which have been often observed in children  have been described as abnormal occurrences. It rather seemed to us that  the child"]]]
