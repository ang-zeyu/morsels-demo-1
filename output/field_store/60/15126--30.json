[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#20)"],[1," escaped the long necessity of being a  persistent and still baffled suitor--we might have had as a completed  whole what we have now only in great fragments, and we should have been  spared the blots which mar a career which ought to have been a noble  one.    The first important matter that happened after Bacon's new appointment  was the Essex divorce case, and the marriage of Lady Essex with the  favourite whom Cecil's death had left at the height of power, and who  from Lord Rochester was now made Earl of Somerset. With the divorce, the  beginning of the scandals and tragedies of James's reign, Bacon had  nothing to do. At the marriage which followed Bacon presented as his  offering a masque, performed by the members of Gray's Inn, of which he  bore the charges, and which cost him the enormous sum of L2000. Whether  it were to repay his obligations to the Howards, or in lieu of a \"fee\"  to Rochester, who levied toll on all favours from the King, it can  hardly be said, as has been suggested, to be a protest against the great  abuse of the times, the sale of offices for money. The \"very splendid  trifle, the Masque of Flowers,\" was one form of the many extravagant  tributes paid but too willingly to high-handed worthlessness, of which  the deeper and darker guilt was to fill all faces with shame two years  afterwards.    As Attorney, Bacon had to take a much more prominent part in affairs,  legal, criminal, constitutional, administrative, than he had yet been  allowed to have. We know that it was his great object to show how much  more active and useful an Attorney he could be than either Coke or  Hobart; and as far as unflagging energy and high ability could make a  good public servant, he fully carried out his purpose. In Parliament,  the \"addled Parliament\" of 1614, in which he sat for the University of  Cambridge, he did his best to reconcile what were fast becoming  irreconcilable, the claims and prerogatives of an absolute king,  irritable, suspicious, exacting, prodigal, with the ancient rights and  liberties, growing stronger in their demands by being denied, resisted,  or outwitted, of the popular element in the State. In the trials, which  are so large and disagreeable a part of the history of these  years--trials arising out of violent words provoked by the violent acts  of power, one of which, Peacham's, became famous, because in the course  of it torture was resorted to, or trials which witnessed to the  corruption of the high society of the day, like the astounding series of  arraignments and condemnations following on the discoveries relating to  Overbury's murder, which had happened just before the Somerset  marriage--Bacon had to make the best that he could for the cruel and  often unequal policy of the Court; and Bacon must take his share in the  responsibility for it. An effort on James's part to stop duelling  brought from Bacon a worthier piece of service, in the shape of an  earnest and elaborate argument against it, full of good sense and good  feeling, but hopelessly in advance of the time. On the many questions  which touched the prerogative, James found in his Attorney a ready and  skilful advocate of his claims, who knew no limit to them but in the  consideration of what was safe and prudent to assert. He was a better  and more statesmanlike counsellor, in his unceasing endeavours to  reconcile James to the expediency of establishing solid and good  relations with his Parliament, and in his advice as to the wise and  hopeful ways of dealing with it. Bacon had no sympathy with popular  wants and claims; of popularity, of all that was called popular, he had  the deepest suspicion and dislike; the opinions and the judgment of  average men he despised, as a thinker, a politician, and a courtier; the  \"malignity of the people\" he thought great. \"I do not love,\" he says,  \"the word _people_.\" But he had a high idea of what was worthy of a  king, and was due to the public interests, and he saw the folly of the  petty acts and haughty words, the use of which James could not resist.  In his new office he once more urged on, and urged in vain, his  favourite project for revising, simplifying, and codifying the law. This  was a project which would find little favour with Coke, and the crowd of  lawyers who venerated him--men whom Bacon viewed with mingled contempt  and apprehension both in the courts and in Parliament where they were  numerous, and whom he more than once advised the King to bridle and keep  \"in awe.\" Bacon presented his scheme to the King in a Proposition, or,  as we should call it, a Report. It is very able and interesting; marked  with his characteristic comprehensiveness and sense of practical needs,  and with a confidence in his own knowledge of law which contrasts  curiously with the current opinion about it. He speaks with the utmost  honour of Coke's work, but he is not afraid of a comparison with him. \"I  do assure your Majesty,\" he says, \"I am in good hope that when Sir  Edward Coke's Reports and my Rules and Decisions shall come to  posterity, there will be (whatever is now thought) question who was the  greater lawyer.\" But the project, though it was entertained and  discussed in Parliament, came to nothing. No one really cared about it  except Bacon.    But in these years (1615 and 1616) two things happened of the utmost  consequence to him. One was the rise, more extravagant than anything  that England had seen for centuries, and in the end more fatal, of the  new favourite, who from plain George Villiers became the all-powerful  Duke of Buckingham. Bacon, like the rest of the world, saw the necessity  of bowing before him; and Bacon persuaded himself that Villiers was  pre-eminently endowed with all the gifts and virtues which a man in his  place would need. We have a series of his letters to Villiers; they are  of course in the complimentary vein which was expected; but if their  language is only compliment, there is no language left for expressing  what a man wishes to be taken for truth. The other matter was the  humiliation, by Bacon's means and in his presence, of his old rival  Coke. In the dispute about jurisdiction, always slumbering and lately  awakened and aggravated by Coke, between the Common Law Courts and the  Chancery, Coke had threatened the Chancery with Praemunire. The King's  jealousy took alarm, and the Chief-Justice was called before the  Council. There a decree, based on Bacon's advice and probably drawn up  by him, peremptorily overruled the legal doctrine maintained by the  greatest and most self-confident judge whom the English courts had seen.  The Chief-Justice had to acquiesce in this reading of the law; and then,  as if such an affront were not enough, Coke was suspended from his  office, and, further, enjoined to review and amend his published  reports, where they were inconsistent with the view of law which on  Bacon's authority the Star Chamber had adopted (June, 1616). This he  affected to do, but the corrections were manifestly only colourable;  his explanations of his legal heresies against the prerogative, as these  heresies were formulated by the Chancellor and Bacon, and presented to  him for recantation, were judged insufficient; and in a decree, prefaced  by reasons drawn up by Bacon, in which, besides Coke's errors of law,  his \"deceit, contempt, and slander of the Government,\" his \"perpetual  turbulent carriage,\" and his affectation of popularity, were noted--he  was removed from his office (Nov., 1616). So, for the present, the old  rivalry had ended in a triumph for Bacon. Bacon, whom Coke had so long  headed in the race, whom he had sneered at as a superficial pretender to  law, and whose accomplishments and enthusiasm for knowledge he utterly  despised, had not only defeated him, but driven him from his seat with  dishonour. When we remember what Coke was, what he had thought of Bacon,  and how he prized his own unique reputation as a representative of  English law, the effects of such a disgrace on a man of his temper  cannot easily be exaggerated.    But for the present Bacon had broken through the spell which had so long  kept him back. He won a great deal of the King's confidence, and the  King was more and more ready to make use of him, though by no means  equally willing to think that Bacon knew better than himself. Bacon's  view of the law, and his resources of argument and expression to make it  good, could be depended upon in the keen struggle to secure and enlarge  the prerogative which was now beginning. In the prerogative both James  and Bacon saw the safety of the State and the only reasonable hope of  good government; but in Bacon's larger and more elevated views of  policy--of a policy worthy of a great king, and a king of England--James  was not likely to take much interest. The memorials which it was  Bacon's habit to present on public affairs were wasted on one who had so  little to learn from others--so he thought and so all assured him--about  the secrets of empire. Still they were proofs of Bacon's ready mind; and  James, even when he disagreed with Bacon's opinion and arguments, was  too clever not to see their difference from the work of other men. Bacon  rose in favour; and from the first he was on the best of terms with  Villiers. He professed to Villiers the most sincere devotion. According  to his custom he presented him with a letter of wise advice on the  duties and behaviour of a favourite. He at once began, and kept up with  him to the end, a confidential correspondence on matters of public  importance. He made it clear that he depended upon Villiers for his own  personal prospects, and it had now become the most natural thing that  Bacon should look forward to succeeding the Lord Chancellor, Ellesmere,  who was fast failing. Bacon had already (Feb. 12, 1615/16). in terms  which seem strange to us, but were less strange then, set forth in a  letter to the King the reasons why"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#20)"],[1,"the annexation of the islands, a joint  resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered  cession and incorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted  by the Congress and approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon directed the  United States steamship _Philadelphia_ to convey Rear-Admiral  Miller to Honolulu, and intrusted to his hands this important  legislative act, to be delivered to the President of the Republic of  Hawaii, with whom the Admiral and the United States minister were  authorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the  sovereignty of the islands to the United States. This was simply but  impressively accomplished on the 12th of August last by the delivery of  a certified copy of the resolution to President Dole, who thereupon  yielded up to the representative of the Government of the United States  the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands.    Pursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of  the authority thereby conferred upon me, I directed that the civil,  judicial, and military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of  the Government of the Republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised  by those officers until Congress shall provide a government for the  incorporated territory, subject to my power to remove such officers and  to fill vacancies. The President, officers, and troops of the Republic  thereupon took the oath of allegiance to the United States, thus  providing for the uninterrupted continuance of all the administrative  and municipal functions of the annexed territory until Congress shall  otherwise enact.    Following the further provision of the joint resolution, I appointed the  Hons. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, John T. Morgan, of Alabama, Robert  R. Hitt, of Illinois, Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F. Frear,  of Hawaii, as commissioners to confer and recommend to Congress such  legislation concerning the Hawaiian Islands as they should deem  necessary or proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission  confided to them, their report will be laid before you at an early day.  It is believed that their recommendations will have the earnest  consideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility resting upon  you to give such shape to the relationship of those mid-Pacific lands to  our home Union as will benefit both in the highest degree, realizing the  aspirations of the community that has cast its lot with us and elected  to share our political heritage, while at the same time justifying the  foresight of those who for three-quarters of a century have looked to  the assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation, in  harmony with our needs and in fulfillment of our cherished traditions.    The questions heretofore pending between Hawaii and Japan growing out  of the alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants were, I am  pleased to say, adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of  a reasonable indemnity to the Government of Japan.    Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the existing customs  relations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with other  countries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide.  The consuls of Hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill  their commercial agencies, while the United States consulate at Honolulu  is maintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and the  revenue. It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian  Islands should receive new exequaturs from this Government.    The attention of Congress is called to the fact that, our consular  offices having ceased to exist in Hawaii and being about to cease in  other countries coming under the sovereignty of the United States, the  provisions for the relief and transportation of destitute American  seamen in these countries under our consular regulations will in  consequence terminate. It is proper, therefore, that new legislation  should be enacted upon this subject in order to meet the changed  conditions.    The interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention  of December 11, 1861, has been at various times the occasion of  controversy with the Government of Mexico. An acute difference arose in  the case of the Mexican demand for the delivery of Jesus Guerra, who,  having led a marauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed  purpose of initiating an insurrection against President Diaz, escaped  into Texas. Extradition was refused on the ground that the alleged  offense was political in its character, and therefore came within the  treaty proviso of nonsurrender. The Mexican contention was that the  exception only related to purely political offenses, and that as  Guerra's acts were admixed with the common crime of murder, arson,  kidnaping, and robbery, the option of nondelivery became void, a  position which this Government was unable to admit in view of the  received international doctrine and practice in the matter. The Mexican  Government, in view of this, gave notice January 24, 1898, of the  termination of the convention, to take effect twelve months from that  date, at the same time inviting the conclusion of a new convention,  toward which negotiations are on foot.    In this relation I may refer to the necessity of some amendment of  our existing extradition statute. It is a common stipulation of such  treaties that neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens,  with the added proviso in one of our treaties, that with Japan, that it  may surrender if it see fit. It is held in this country by an almost  uniform course of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation  to surrender the President is not invested with legal authority to act.  The conferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound  morality which shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a  heinous crime. Again, statutory provision might well be made for what is  styled extradition by way of transit, whereby a fugitive surrendered by  one foreign government to another may be conveyed across the territory  of the United States to the jurisdiction of the demanding state.  A recommendation in this behalf made in the President's message of  1886[23] was not acted upon. The matter is presented for your  consideration.    The problem of the Mexican free zone has been often discussed with  regard to its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the  United States along an extensive and thinly guarded land border.  The effort made by the joint resolution of March 1, 1895, to remedy the  abuse charged by suspending the privilege of free transportation in  bond across the territory of the United States to Mexico failed of good  result, as is stated in Report No. 702 of the House of Representatives,  submitted in the last session, March 11, 1898. As the question is one to  be conveniently met by wise concurrent legislation of the two countries  looking to the protection of the revenues by harmonious measures  operating equally on either side of the boundary, rather than by  conventional arrangements, I suggest that Congress consider the  advisability of authorizing and inviting a conference of representatives  of the Treasury Departments of the United States and Mexico to consider  the subject in all its complex bearings, and make report with pertinent  recommendations to the respective Governments for the information and  consideration of their Congresses.    The Mexican Water Boundary Commission has adjusted all matters  submitted to it to the satisfaction of both Governments save in three  important cases--that of the \"Chamizal\" at El Paso, Tex., where the two  commissioners failed to agree, and wherein, for this case only, this  Government has proposed to Mexico the addition of a third member; the  proposed elimination of what are known as \"Bancos,\" small isolated  islands formed by the cutting off of bends in the Rio Grande, from  the operation of the treaties of 1884 and 1889, recommended by the  commissioners and approved by this Government, but still under  consideration by Mexico; and the subject of the \"Equitable distribution  of the waters of the Rio Grande,\" for which the commissioners  recommended an international dam and reservoir, approved by Mexico, but  still under consideration by this Government. Pending these questions  it is necessary to extend the life of the commission, which expires  December 23 next.    The coronation of the young Queen of the Netherlands was made the  occasion of fitting congratulations.    The claim of Victor H. McCord against Peru, which for a number of  years has been pressed by this Government and has on several occasions  attracted the attention of the Congress, has been satisfactorily  adjusted. A protocol was signed May 17, 1898, whereby, the fact of  liability being admitted, the question of the amount to be awarded was  submitted to the chief justice of Canada as sole arbitrator. His award  sets the indemnity due the claimant at $40,000.    The Government of Peru has given the prescribed notification of its  intention to abrogate the treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation  concluded with this country August 31, 1887. As that treaty contains  many important provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce  and good relations, which could with difficulty be replaced by the  negotiation of renewed provisions within the brief twelve months  intervening before the treaty terminates, I have invited suggestions by  Peru as to the particular provisions it is desired to annul, in the hope  of reaching an arrangement whereby the remaining articles may be  provisionally saved.    His Majesty the Czar having announced his purpose to raise the  Imperial Russian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy,  I responded, under the authority conferred by the act of March 3,"]]]
