She displayed, in these court-contentions, an ability  partaking both of firmness and pliancy.  The difficulties of foreign  policy found her equally active and prudent.  The greatest peril which  France could at that time incur arose from the maintenance of the union  between the King of England and Charles V.  At the first news of the  battle of Pavia, Henry VIII. dreamed for a moment of the partition of  France between Charles and himself, with the crown of France for his own  share; demonstrations of joy took place at the court of London; and  attempts were made to levy, without the concurrence of Parliament,  imposts capable of sufficing for such an enterprise.  But the English  nation felt no inclination to put up with this burden and the king's  arbitrary power in order to begin over again the Hundred Years' War.  The primate, Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote to Cardinal Wolsey,  \"It is reported to me that when the people had orders to make bonfires  for the capture of the King of France, many folks said that it was more  reason for weeping than for rejoicing.  Others openly expressed their  desire that the King of France might be set at liberty, that a happy  peace might be concluded, and that the king might not attempt to conquer  France again, a conquest more burdensome than profitable, and more  difficult to keep than to make.\"  Wolsey himself was cooled towards  Charles V., who, instead of writing to him as of old, and signing with  his own hand, \"your son and cousin,\" now merely put his name, Charles.  The regent, Louise of Savoy, profited ably by these feelings and  circumstances in England; a negotiation was opened between the two  courts; Henry VIII. gained by it two millions of crowns payable by annual  instalments of fifty thousand crowns each, and Wolsey received a pension  of a hundred thousand crowns.  At first a truce for four months, and then  an alliance, offensive and defensive, were concluded on the 30th of  August, 1525, between France and England; and the regent, Louise of  Savoy, had no longer to trouble herself about anything except the  captivity of the king her son and the departure of her daughter Margaret  to go and negotiate for the liberation of the prisoner.    The negotiation had been commenced, as early as the 20th of July, at  Toledo, between the ambassadors of Francis I. and the advisers of Charles  V., but without any symptom of progress.  Francis I., since his arrival  in Spain, had been taken from strong castle to strong castle, and then  removed to Madrid, everywhere strictly guarded, and leading a sad life,  without Charles V.'s coming to visit him or appointing him any  meeting-place.  In vain did the emperor's confessor, the Bishop of Osma,  advise him to treat Francis I. generously, and so lay upon him either the  obligation of thankfulness or the burden of ingratitude; the majority of  his servants gave him contrary counsel.  \"I know not what you mean to  do,\" wrote his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand; \"but, if I were wise  enough to know how to give you good counsel, it seems to me that such an  opportunity should not be lost, but that you should follow up your good  fortune and act in such wise that neither the King of France nor his  successors should have power hereafter to do harm to you or yours.\"  That, too, was Charles V.'s own way of thinking; but, slow and patient  as he was by nature, he relied upon the discomforts and the wearisomeness  of prolonged captivity and indecision for tiring out Francis I. and  overcoming his resistance to the harsh conditions he would impose upon  him.  The regent, Louise, made him an offer to go herself and treat with  him, at Perpignan, for the king's liberation; but he did not accept that  overture.  The Duke of Alencon, son-in-law of Louise, had died at Lyons,  unable to survive the shame of his flight at the battle of Pavia; and the  regent hinted that her daughter Marguerite, three months a widow, \"would  be happy if she could be agreeable to his Imperial Majesty,\" but Charles  let the hint drop without a reply.  However, at the end of August, 1525,  he heard that Francis I. was ill: \"from great melancholy he had fallen  into a violent fever.\"  The population of Madrid was in commotion;  Francis I. had become popular there; many people went to pray for him in  the churches; the doctors told the emperor that there was fear for the  invalid's life, and that he alone could alleviate the malady by  administering some hope.  Charles V. at once granted the safe-conduct  which had been demanded of him for Marguerite of France, and on the 18th  of September he himself went to Madrid to pay a visit to the captive.  Francis, on seeing him enter the chamber, said, \"So your Majesty has come  to see your prisoner die?\"  \"You are not my prisoner,\" answered Charles,  \"but my brother and my friend: I have no other purpose than to give you  your liberty and every satisfaction you can desire.\"  Next day Marguerite  arrived; her mother, the regent, had accompanied her as far as  Pont-Saint-Esprit; she had embarked, on the 27th of August, at  Aigues-Mortes, and, disembarking at Barcelona, had gone to Madrid by  litter; in order to somewhat assuage her impatience she had given  expression to it in the following tender stanzas:                   \"For the bliss that awaits me so strong                 Is my yearning that yearning is pain;                 One hour is a hundred years long;                 My litter, it bears me in vain;                 It moves not, or seems to recede;                 Such speed would I make if I might:                 O, the road, it is weary indeed,                 Where lies--at the end--my delight!                   \"I gaze all around me all day                 For some one with tidings to bring,                 Not ceasing--ne'er doubt me--to pray                 Unto God for the health of my king                 I gaze; and when none is descried,                 Then I weep; and, what else? if you ask,                 To my paper my grief I confide                 This, this is my sorrowful task.                   \"O, welcome be he who at length                 Shall tap at my door and shall cry,                 'The king to new health and new strength                 Is returning; the king will not die!'                 Then she, who were now better dead,                 Will run, the news-bearer to see,                 And kiss him for what he hath said,                 That her brother from danger is free.\"      Francis was not \"free from danger\" when his sister arrived; she took her  post at his side; on the 25th of September a serious crisis came on; and  he remained for some time \"without speaking, or hearing, or seeing.\"  Marguerite had an altar set up in her chamber; and all the French, of the  household, great lords and domestics, knelt beside the sick man's sister,  and received the communion from the, hands of the Archbishop of Embrun,  who, drawing near the bed, entreated the king to turn his eyes to the  holy sacrament.  Francis came out of his lethargy, and asked to  communicate likewise, saying, \"God will cure me, soul and body.\"  He  became convalescent, and on the 20th of October he was sufficiently  recovered for Marguerite to leave Madrid, and go and resume negotiations  at Toledo, whither Charles V. had returned.    The day but one after her arrival she wrote to the king, \"The emperor  gave me courteous and kind reception, and, after coming to meet me at the  entrance of this house, he used very kind and courteous language to me.  He desired that he and I should be alone in the same room, and one of my  women to keep the door.  This evening I will send you word of what has  been done; entreating you, my lord, to put on before Sieur Alancon (the  king's custodian) an air of weakness and weariness, for your debility  will strengthen me and will hasten my despatch, which seems to me slower  than I can tell you; as well for the sake of seeing you liberated, which  you will be by God's help, as of returning and trying whether your dear  hand can be of any use to you.\"  Marguerite was impressed by the  good-will she discovered at the court of Toledo in respect of the King of  France, his liberation, and the establishment of peace; she received from  the people in the streets, as well as from the great lords in their  houses, the most significant proofs of favor.  Charles V. took umbrage at  it, and had the Duke of Infantado, amongst others, informed that, if he  wished to please the emperor, neither he nor his sons must speak to  Madame d'Alencon.  \"But,\" said she, \"I am not tabooed to the ladies, to  whom I will speak double.\"  She contracted a real intimacy with even the  sister of Charles V., Eleanor, widow of the King of Portugal, whom  Charles had promised to the Duke of Bourbon, and between whom and her  brother, King Francis, Marguerite set brewing a marriage, which was not  long deferred.  But, in spite of her successes at the court, and even in  the family of the emperor, Marguerite had no illusions touching the small  chance of bringing her grand object of negotiation to a happy issue.  \"Every one tells me,\" she wrote, \"that he loves the king; but there is  small experience of it.  .  .  .  If I had to do with good sort of  people, who understand what honor is, I would not care; but the contrary  is the case.\"  She did not lose courage, however: \"she spoke to the  emperor so bravely and courteously,\" says Brantome, \"that he was quite  astounded, and she said still worse to those of his council, at which  she had audience; there she had full triumph of her good speaking and  haranguing, with an easy grace in which she was not deficient; and she  did so well with her fine speaking that she made herself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#20)"],[1,"embarassment.  He prostrated himself, as she  advanced to greet him, sat down in the middle of the circle, covered his  head for a moment with his red hat, which he removed immediately, and  made his compliments; he began with his own surprise at finding himself  in such a position in presence of Madame, spoke of the baseness of his  birth and his first employments; employed them with much cleverness and  in very choice terms to extol so much the more the kindness, courage, and  power of the Duke of Orleans, who from so low had raised him to where he  found himself; gave Madame some delicate incense; in fine, dissolved in  the most profound respect and gratitude, doing it so well that Madame  herself could not help, when he was gone, praising his discourse and his  countenance, at the same time adding that she was mad to see him where he  was.\"    The bearing of the newly-elected was less modest at the council of  regency; he got himself accompanied thither by Cardinal Rohan; their rank  gave the two ecclesiastics precedence.  The Duke of Noailles,  d'Aguesseau, and some other great lords refused to sit with Dubois.  \"This day, sir, will be famous in history,\" said the Duke of Noailles to  the new cardinal; \"it will not fail to be remarked therein that your  entrance into the council caused it to be deserted by the grandees of the  kingdom.\"  Noailles was exiled, as well as d'Aguesseau.    The great lords had made a decided failure in government.  Since 1718,  the different councils had been abolished; defended by Abbe St. Pierre,  under the grotesque title of Polysynodie, they had earned for the candid  preacher of universal peace his exclusion from the French Academy, which  was insisted upon by the remnants of the old court, whom he had mortally  offended by styling Louis XIV.'s governmental system a viziership.  The  Regent had heaped favors upon the presidents and members of the councils,  but he had placed Dubois at the head of foreign affairs and Le Blanc over  the war department.  \"I do not inquire into the theory of councils,\" said  the able Dubois to the Regent by the mouth of his confidant Chavigny; \"it  was, as you know, the object of worship to the shallow pates of the old  court.  Humiliated by their nonentity at the end of the last reign, they  begot this system upon the reveries of M. de Cambrai.  But I think of  you, I think of your interests.  The king will reach, his majority, the  grandees of the kingdom approach the monarque by virtue of their birth;  if to this privilege they unite that of being then at the head of  affairs, there is reason to fear that they may surpass you in  complaisance, in flattery, may represent you as a useless phantom, and  establish themselves upon the ruin of you.  Suppress, then, these  councils, if you mean to continue indispensable, and haste to supersede  the great lords, who would become your rivals, by means of simple  secretaries of state, who, without standing or family, will perforce  remain your creatures.\"    The Duke of Antin, son of Madame de Montespan, one of the most adroit  courtiers of the old as well as of the new court, \"honorless and  passionless\" (_sans honneur et sans humeur_), according to the Regent's  own saying, took a severer view than Dubois of the arrangement to which  he had contributed.  \"The councils are dissolved,\" he wrote in his  memoirs; \"the nobility will never recover from it--to my great regret,  I must confess.  The kings who hereafter reign will see that Louis XIV.,  one of the greatest kings in the world, never would employ people of rank  in any of his business; that the Regent, a most enlightened prince, had  begun by putting them at the head of all affairs, and was obliged to  remove them at the end of three years.  What can they and must they  conclude therefrom?  That people of this condition are not fitted for  business, and that they are good for nothing but to get killed in war.  I hope I am wrong, but there is every appearance that the masters will  think like that, and there will not be wanting folks who will confirm  them in that opinion.\"  A harsh criticism on the French nobility, too  long absorbed by war or the court, living apart from the nation and from  affairs, and thereby become incapable of governing, put down once for all  by the iron hand of Richelieu, without ever having been able to resume at  the head of the country the rank and position which befitted them.    The special councils were dissolved, the council of regency diminished;  Dubois became premier minister in name--he had long been so in fact.    He had just concluded an important matter, one which the Regent had much  at heart--the marriage of the king with the Infanta of Spain, and that of  Mdlle. de Montpensier, daughter of the Duke of Orleans, with the Prince  of the Asturias.  The Duke of St. Simon was intrusted with the official  demand.  Philip V. was rejoiced to see his daughter's elevation to that  throne which he still regarded as the first in the world; he purchased it  by the concession made to the Regent.    The age of the Infanta was a serious obstacle; she was but three years  old, the king was twelve.  When the Duke of Orleans went in state to  announce to Louis XV. the negotiation which tarried for nothing further  but his consent, the young prince, taken by surprise, was tongue-tied,  seemed to have his heart quite full, and his eyes grew moist.  His  preceptor, Fleury, Bishop of Frejus, who had just refused the  Archbishopric of Rheims, seeing that he must make up his mind to please  the Regent or estrange him, supported what had just been said.  \"Marshal  Villeroy, decided by the bishop's example, said to the king, 'Come, my  dear master; the thing must be done with a good grace.'  The Regent, very  much embarrassed, the duke, mighty taciturn, and Dubois, with an air of  composure, waited for the king to break a silence which lasted a quarter  of an hour, whilst the bishop never ceased whispering to the king.  As  the silence continued, and the assembly of all the council, at which the  king was about to appear, could not but augment his timidity, the bishop  turned to the Regent, and said to him, 'His Majesty will go to the  council, but he wants a little time to prepare himself for it.'  Thereupon the Regent replied, that he was created to await the  convenience of the king, saluted him with an air of respect and  affection, went out and made signs to the rest to follow him.  A quarter  of an hour later the king entered the council, with his eyes still red,  and replied, with a very short and rather low yes, to the Regent's  question, whether he thought proper that the news of his marriage should  be imparted to the council.\"  \"It was the assurance of peace with Spain,  and the confirmation of the recent treaties; the Regent's enemies saw in  it the climax of the policy, by the choice of an infant, which retarded  the king's marriage.\"  [Memoires secrets de Dubois, t. ii.  p. 163.]    Accusations of greater gravity had been recently renewed against the Duke  of Orleans.  The king had been ill; for just a moment the danger had  appeared serious; the emotion in France was general, the cabal opposed to  the Regent went beyond mere anxiety.  \"The consternation everywhere was  great,\" says St. Simon; \"I had the privileges of entry, and so I went  into the king's chamber.  I found it very empty; the Duke of Orleans  seated at the chimney-corner, very forlorn and very sad.  I went up to  him for a moment, then I approached the king's bed.  At that moment,  Boulduc, one of his apothecaries, was giving him something to take.  The  Duchess of la Ferte was at Boulduc's elbow, and, having turned round to  see who was coming, she saw me, and all at once said to me, betwixt loud  and soft, 'He is poisoned, he is poisoned.'  'Hold your tongue, do,' said  I; 'that is awful!'  She went on again, so much and so loud, that I was  afraid the king would hear her.  Boulduc and I looked at one another, and  I immediately withdrew from the bed and from that madwoman, with whom I  was on no sort of terms.  The illness was not a long one, and the  convalescence was speedy, which restored tranquillity and joy, and caused  an outburst of Te Deums and rejoicings.  On St. Louis' day, at the  concert held every year on that evening at the Tuileries, the crowd was  so dense that a pin would not have fallen to the ground in the garden.  The windows of the Tuileries were decorated and crammed full, and all the  roofs of the Carrousel filled with all that could hold on there, as well  as the square.  Marshal Villeroy revelled in this concourse, which bored  the king, who kept hiding himself every moment in the corners; the  marshal pulled him out by the arm and led him up to the windows.  Everybody shouted 'Hurrah! for the king!' and the marshal, detaining the  king, who would still have gone and hidden himself, said, 'Pray look, my  dear master, at all this company, all this people; it is all yours, it  all belongs to you; you are their master; pray give them a look or two  just to satisfy them!'  A fine lesson for a governor, and one which he  did not tire of impressing upon him, so fearful was he lest he should  forget it; accordingly he retained it very perfectly.\"    [Illustration: The Boy King and his People----104]    The Duke of Beauvilliers and Fenelon taught the Duke of Burgundy  differently; the Duke of Montausier and Bossuet himself, in spite of the  majestic errors of his political conceptions, had not forgotten in the  education of the granddauphin the lesson of kings' duties towards their  peoples.    Already, over the very infancy of Louis XV. was passing the breath of  decay; little by little that people, as yet so attached to their young  sovereign, was about to lose all respect and submission towards its  masters; a trait long characteristic of the French nation.    The king's majority was approaching, the Regent's power"]]]
