They had spread out a little and whenever Old Jack veered a  yard or two from the pursuers some one gained. He saw a coil of rope fly  through the air and he bent forward again. It struck Old Jack on the  saddle and fell to the ground. Ned wondered why they did not fire now,  but he remembered that their rifles or muskets, too, might be empty, and  suddenly he felt a strange exultation. He was still lying forward on his  horse's neck, and now he began to talk to him.    \"On! On! Old Jack,\" he said, \"show 'em the cleanest heels that were ever  seen in Texas! On! On! my beauty of a horse, my jewel of a horse! Would  you let miserable Mexican ponies overtake you? You who were never  beaten! Ah, now we gain! But faster! faster!\"    It seemed that Old Jack understood. He stretched out his long neck and  became a streak in the darkness. A third Mexican threw his lasso, but  the noose only touched his flying tail. A fourth threw, and the noose  did not reach him at all.    They were far out on the plain now, where the moonlight revealed  everything, and the horse's sure instinct would guide. Ned felt Old Jack  beneath him, running strong and true without a jar like the most perfect  piece of machinery. He stole a glance over his shoulder. All the  Mexicans were there, too far away now for a throw of the lasso, but  several of them were trying to reload their weapons. Ned knew that if  they succeeded he would be in great danger. No matter how badly they  shot a chance bullet might hit him or his horse. And he could afford for  neither himself nor Old Jack to be wounded.    Once more the boy leaned far over on his horse's neck and cried in his  ear:    \"On, Old Jack, on! Look, we gain now, but we must gain more. Show to  them what a horse you are!\"    And again the great horse responded. Fast as he was going it seemed to  Ned that he now lengthened his stride. His long head was thrust out  almost straight, and his great body fairly skimmed the earth. But the  Mexicans hung on with grim tenacity. Their ponies were tough and  enduring, and, spread out like the arc of a bow, they continually  profited by some divergence that Old Jack made from the straight line.  Aware of this danger Ned himself, nevertheless, was unable to tell  whether the horse was going in a direct course, and he let him have his  head.    \"Crack!\" went a musket, and a bullet sang past Ned's face. It grazed Old  Jack's ear, drawing blood. The horse uttered an angry snort and fairly  leaped forward. Ned looked back again. Another man had succeeded in  loading his musket and was about to fire. Then the boy remembered the  pistol at his belt. Snatching it out he fired at the fellow with the  loaded musket.    The Mexican reeled forward on his horse's neck and his weapon dropped to  the ground. Whether the man himself fell also Ned never knew, because he  quickly thrust the pistol back in his belt and once more was looking  straight ahead. Now confidence swelled again in his heart. He had  escaped all their bullets so far, and he was still gaining. He would  escape all the others and he would continue to gain.    He saw just ahead of him one of the clumps of trees that dotted the  plain, but, although it might give momentary protection from the bullets  he was afraid to gallop into it, lest he be swept from his horse's back  by the boughs or bushes. But his direct course would run close to the  left side of it, and once more he sought to urge Old Jack to greater  speed.    The horse was still running without a jar. Ned could not feel a single  rough movement in the perfect machinery beneath him. Unless wounded Old  Jack would not fail him. He stole another of those fleeting glances  backward.    Several of the Mexicans, their ponies spent, were dropping out of the  race, but enough were left to make the odds far too great. Ned now  skimmed along the edge of the grove, and when he passed it he turned his  horse a little, so the trees were between him and his nearest pursuers.  Then he urged Old Jack to his last ounce of speed. The plain raced  behind him, and fortunate clouds, too, now came, veiling the moon and  turning the dusk into deeper darkness. Ned heard one disappointed cry  behind him, and then no sound but the flying beat of his own horse's  hoofs.    When he pulled rein and brought Old Jack to a walk he could see or hear  nothing of the Mexicans. The great horse was a lather of foam, his sides  heaving and panting, and Ned sprang to the ground. He reloaded his rifle  and pistol and then walked toward the west, leading Old Jack by the  bridle. He reckoned that the Mexicans would go toward the north,  thinking that he would naturally ride for San Antonio, and hence he  chose the opposite direction.    He walked a long time and presently he felt the horse rubbing his nose  gently against his arm. Ned stroked the soft muzzle.    \"You've saved my life. Old Jack,\" he said, \"and not for the first time.  You responded to every call.\"    The horse whinnied ever so softly, and Ned felt that he was not alone.  Now he threw the bridle reins back over the horse's head, and then the  two walked on, side by side, man and beast.    They stopped at times, and it may be that the horse as well as the boy  then looked and listened for a foe. But the Mexicans had melted away  completely in the night. It was likely now that they were going in the  opposite direction, and assured that he was safe from them for the time  Ned collapsed, both physically and mentally. Such tremendous exertions  and such terrible excitement were bound to bring reaction. He began to  tremble violently, and he became so weak that he could scarcely stand.  The horse seemed to be affected in much the same way and walked slowly  and painfully.    Ned saw another little grove, and he and the horse walked straight  toward it. It was fairly dense, and when he was in the center of it he  wrapped his rifle and himself in his serape and lay down. The horse sank  on his side near him. He did not care for anything now except to secure  rest. Mexicans or Comanches or Lipans might be on the plain only a few  hundred yards away. It did not matter to him. He responded to no emotion  save the desire for rest, and in five minutes he was in a deep sleep.    Ned slept until long after daylight. He was so much exhausted that he  scarcely moved during all that time. Nor did the horse. Old Jack had run  his good race and won the victory, and he, too, cared for nothing but to  rest.    Before morning some Lipan buffalo hunters passed, but they took no  notice of the grove and soon disappeared in the west. After the dawn a  detachment of Mexican lancers riding to the east to join the force of  Santa Anna also passed the clump of trees, but the horse and man lay in  the densest part of it, and no pair of Mexican eyes was keen enough to  see them there. They were answering the call of Santa Anna, and they  rode on at a trot, the grove soon sinking out of sight behind them.    Ned was awakened at last by the sun shining in his face. He stirred,  recalled in a vague sort of way where he was and why he was there, and  then rose slowly to his feet. His joints were stiff like those of an old  man, and he rubbed them to acquire ease. A great bay horse, saddle on  his back, was searching here and there for the young stems of grass. Ned  rubbed his eyes. It seemed to him that he knew that horse. And a fine  big horse he was, too, worth knowing and owning. Yes, it was Old Jack,  the horse that had carried him to safety.    His little store of provisions was still tied to the saddle and he ate  hungrily. At the end of the grove was a small pool formed by the  winter's rains, and though the water was far from clear he drank his  fill. He flexed and tensed his muscles again until all the stiffness and  soreness were gone. Then he made ready for his departure.    He could direct his course by the sun, and he intended to go straight to  San Antonio. He only hoped that he might get there before the arrival of  Santa Anna and his army. He could not spare the time to seek his  comrades, and he felt much apprehension for them, but he yet had the  utmost confidence in the skill of the Panther and Obed White.    It was about two hours before noon when Ned set out across the plain.  Usually in this region antelope were to be seen on the horizon, but  they were all gone now. The boy considered it a sure sign that Mexican  detachments had passed that way. It was altogether likely, too, so he  calculated, that the Mexican army was now nearer than he to San Antonio.  His flight had taken him to the west while Santa Anna was moving  straight toward the Texan outworks. But he believed that by steady  riding he could reach San Antonio within twenty-four hours.    The afternoon passed without event. Ned saw neither human beings nor  game on the vast prairie. He had hoped that by some chance he might meet  with his comrades, but there was no sign of them, and he fell back on  his belief that their skill and great courage had saved them. Seeking to  dismiss them from his thoughts for the time in order that he might  concentrate all his energies on San Antonio, he rode on. The horse had  recovered completely from his great efforts of the preceding night, and  once more that magnificent piece of machinery worked without a jar. Old  Jack moved over the prairie with long, easy strides. It seemed to Ned  that he could never grow weary. He patted the sinewy and powerful neck.    \"Gallant comrade,\" he said, \"you have done your duty and more. You, at  least, will never fail.\"    Twilight came down, but Ned kept on. By and by he saw in the east, and  for the third time, that fatal red glow extending far along the dusky  horizon. All that he had feared of Santa Anna was true. The dictator was  marching fast, whipping his army forward with the fierce energy that was  a part of his nature."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic?

Food conditions were becoming worse, the people were  becoming more dissatisfied; losses on the battlefields were touching  nearly every family.  Depression was growing.  Every one felt that  something had to be done and done immediately.    The press referred to these months of turmoil as a period of \"new  orientation.\"  It was a time of readjustment which did not reach a  climax until December twelfth when the Chancellor proposed peace  conferences to the Allies.               *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *         WHAT YOU CANNOT EAT OR DRINK         FOODSTUFFS WHICH ARE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED IN GERMANY      1.

THE FOOD SITUATION AT A GLANCE         *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *          CHAPTER VII    THE BUBBLING ECONOMIC VOLCANO    When I entered Germany in 1915 there was plenty of food everywhere and  prices were normal.  But a year later the situation had changed so that  the number of food cards--Germany's economic barometer--had increased  eight times.  March and April of 1916 were the worst months in the year  and a great many people had difficulty in getting enough food to eat.  There was growing dissatisfaction with the way the Government was  handling the food problem but the people's hope was centred upon the  next harvest.  In April and May the submarine issue and the American  crisis turned public attention from food to politics.  From July to  October the Somme battles kept the people's minds centred upon military  operations.  While the scarcity of food became greater the Government,  through inspired articles in the press, informed the people that the  harvest was so big that there would be no more food difficulties.    Germany began to pay serious attention to the food situation, when  early in the year, Adolph von Batocki, the president of East Prussia  and a big land owner, was made food dictator.  At the same time there  were organised various government food departments.  There was an  Imperial Bureau for collecting fats; another to take charge of the meat  supply; another to control the milk and another in charge of the  vegetables and fruit.  Germany became practically a socialistic state  and in this way the Government kept abreast of the growth of Socialism  among the people.  The most important step the Government took was to  organise the Zentral Einkaufgesellschaft, popularly known as the \"Z. E.  G.\"  The first object of this organisation was to purchase food in  neutral countries.  Previously German merchants had been going to  Holland, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries to buy supplies.  These merchants had been bidding against each other in order to get  products for their concerns.  In this way food was made much more  expensive than it would have been had one purchaser gone outside of  Germany.  So the Government prohibited all firms from buying food  abroad.  Travelling agents of the \"Z. E. G.\" went to these countries  and bought all of the supplies available at a fixed price.  Then these  resold to German dealers at cost.    Such drastic measures were necessitated by the public demand that every  one share alike.  The Government found it extremely difficult to  control the food.  Farmers and rich landowners insisted upon  slaughtering their own pigs for their own use.  They insisted upon  eating the eggs their chickens laid, or, upon sending them through the  mail to friends at high prices, thereby evading the egg card  regulations.  But the Government stepped in and farmers were prohibited  from killing their own cattle and from sending foods to friends and  special customers.  Farmers had to sell everything to the \"Z. E. G.\"  That was another result of State Socialism.    The optimistic statements of Herr von Batocki about the food outlook  led the people to believe that by fall conditions would be greatly  improved but instead of becoming more plentiful food supplies became  more and more organised until all food was upon an absolute ration  basis.    \"Although the crops were good this year, there will be so much  organisation that food will spoil,\" said practically every German.  Batocki's method of confiscating food did cause a great deal to spoil  and the public blamed him any time anything disappeared from the  market.  One day a carload of plums was shipped from Werder, the big  fruit district near Berlin, to the capital.  The \"Z. E. G.\" confiscated  it but did not sell the goods immediately to the merchants and the  plums spoiled.  Before this was found out, a crowd of women surrounded  the train one day, which was standing on a side track, broke into a car  and found most of the plums in such rotten condition they could not be  used.  So they painted on the sides of the car: \"This is the kind of  plum jam the 'Z. E. G.' makes.\"    There was a growing scarcity of all other supplies, too.  The armies  demanded every possible labouring man and woman so even the canning  factories had to close and food which formerly was canned had to be  eaten while fresh or it spoiled.  Even the private German family, which  was accustomed to canning food, had to forego this practice because of  a lack of tin cans, jars and rubber bands.    The food depots are by far the most successful undertaking of the  Government.  In Cologne and Berlin alone close to 500,000 poor are  being fed daily by municipal kitchens.  Last October I went through the  Cologne food department with the director.  The city has rented a  number of large vacant factory buildings and made them into kitchens.  Municipal buyers go through the country to buy meat and vegetables.  This is shipped to Cologne, and in these kitchens it is prepared by  women workers, under the direction of volunteers.    A stew is cooked each day and sold for 42 pfennigs (about eight cents)  a quart.  The people must give up their potato, fat and meat cards to  obtain it.  In Berlin and all other large cities, the same system is  used.  In one kitchen in Berlin, at the main market hall, 80,000 quarts  a day are prepared.    In Cologne this food is distributed through the city streets by  municipal wagons, and the people get it almost boiling hot, ready to  eat.  Were it not for these food depots there would be many thousands  of people who would starve because they could not buy and cook such  nourishing food for the price the city asks.  These food kitchens have  been in use now almost a year, and, while the poor are obtaining food  here, they are becoming very tired of the supply, because they must eat  stews every day.  They can have nothing fried or roasted.    In addition to these kitchens the Government has opened throughout  Germany \"mittlestand kueche,\" a restaurant for the middle classes.  Here government employees, with small wages, the poor who do not keep  house and others with little means can obtain a meal for 10 cents,  consisting of a stew and a dessert.  But it is very difficult for  people to live on this food.  Most every one who is compelled by  circumstances to eat here is losing weight and feels under-nourished  all the time.    A few months ago, after one of my secretaries had been called to the  army; I employed another.  He had been earning only $7 a week and had  to support his wife.  On this money they ate at the middle class cafes.  In six months he had lost twenty pounds.    Because the food is so scarce and because it lacks real nourishment  people eat all the time.  It used to be said before the war that the  Germans were the biggest eaters in Europe--that they ate seven meals a  day.  The blockade has not made them less eaters, for they eat every  few hours all day long now, but because the food lacks fats and sugars,  they need more food. "]]]
