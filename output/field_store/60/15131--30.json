Agriculture accounts for almost 45% of GDP, employs about 60% of  the labor force, and generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings.  The industrial sector contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs  2% of the work force.

Davis for the fair plaintiff. H.W.  Beckwith, Ward Lamon, and Abraham Lincoln were for the defendant. The  little town of Danville was crowded with people from far and near who  had come to hear the big speeches. The evidence brought out in the  trial was in every way against the defendant, and the sympathy of the  public was, naturally enough, with the young lady plaintiff. Lincoln and  his associate counsel plainly saw the hopelessness of their cause; and  they wisely concluded to let their side of the case stand upon its  merits, without even a plea of extenuating circumstances. Voorhees was  young, ambitious, and anxious to display his oratory. He arranged with  his colleagues at the beginning that he should make a speech, and he  spent several hours in his room at the hotel in the preparation of an  oratorical avalanche. It became generally known that Dan was going to  out-do himself, and the expectation of the community was at its highest  tension. The little old court-house was crowded. The ladies were out in  full force. Voorhees came in a little late, glowing with the excitement  of the occasion. It had been arranged that Davis was to open, Lincoln  was to follow, and Voorhees should come next. Mr. Davis made a clear  statement of the case, recited the character of the evidence, and closed  with a plain logical argument. Then Lincoln arose, and stood in silence  for a moment, looking at the jury. He deliberately re-arranged some of  the books and papers on the table before him, as though \"making a good  ready,\" as he used to say, and began in a spirited but deliberate way:  \"Your Honor, the evidence in this case is all in, and doubtless all  concerned comprehend its fullest import without the aid of further  argument. Therefore we will rest our case here.\" This move, of course,  cut off all future discussion. Voorhees, with his load of pyrotechnics  was shut out. An ominous silence followed Lincoln's remark; then  Voorhees arose, white with rage, and entered a protest against the  tactics of the defense. All the others were disappointed, but amused,  and the only consolation that Voorhees got out of this affair was a  verdict for the full amount claimed by his client. But he never forgave  Lincoln for thus \"nipping\" his great speech \"in the bud.\"    Mr. Wickizer gives a story which illustrates the off-hand readiness of  Lincoln's wit. \"In the court at Bloomington Mr. Lincoln was engaged in a  case of no great importance; but the attorney on the other side, Mr. S.,  a young lawyer of fine abilities, was always very sensitive about being  beaten, and in this case he manifested unusual zeal and interest. The  case lasted until late at night, when it was finally submitted to the  jury. Mr. S. spent a sleepless night in anxiety, and early next morning  learned, to his great chagrin, that he had lost the case. Mr. Lincoln  met him at the court-house and asked him what had become of his case.  With lugubrious countenance and melancholy tone, Mr. S. said, 'It's gone  to hell!' 'Oh, well!' replied Lincoln, 'Never mind,--you can try it  again there!'\"    Lincoln was always ready to join in a laugh at his own expense, and used  to tell the following story with intense enjoyment: \"In the days when I  used to be 'on the circuit' I was accosted in the cars by a stranger who  said, 'Excuse me, sir, but I have an article in my possession which  belongs to you.' 'How is that?' I asked, considerably astonished. The  stranger took a jack-knife from his pocket. 'This knife,' said he, 'was  placed in my hands some years ago with the injunction that I was to keep  it until I found a man uglier than myself. I have carried it from that  time to this. Allow me to say, sir, that I think you are fairly entitled  to the property.'\"    Mr. Gillespie says of Lincoln's passion for story-telling: \"As a boon  companion, Lincoln, although he never drank liquor or used tobacco in  any form, was without a rival. No one would ever think of 'putting in'  when he was talking. He could illustrate any subject, it seemed to me,  with an appropriate and amusing anecdote. He did not tell stories merely  for the sake of telling them, but rather by way of illustration of  something that had happened or been said. There seemed to be no end to  his fund of stories.\" Mr. Lamon states: \"Lincoln frequently said that he  lived by his humor and would have died without it. His manner of telling  a story was irresistibly comical, the fun of it dancing in his eyes and  playing over every feature. His face changed in an instant; the hard  lines faded out of it, and the mirth seemed to diffuse itself all over  him like a spontaneous tickle. You could see it coming long before he  opened his mouth, and he began to enjoy the 'point' before his eager  auditors could catch the faintest glimpse of it. Telling and hearing  ridiculous stories was one of his ruling passions.\" A good illustration  of this fondness for story-telling is given by Judge Sibley, of Quincy,  Illinois, who knew Lincoln when practicing law at Springfield. One day a  party of lawyers were sitting in the law library of the court-house at  Springfield, awaiting the opening of court, and telling stories to fill  the time. Judge Breese of the Supreme bench--one of the most  distinguished of American jurists, and a man of great personal  dignity--passed through the room where the lawyers were sitting, on his  way to open court. Lincoln, seeing him, called out in his hearty way,  \"Hold on, Breese! Don't open court yet! Here's Bob Blackwell just going  to tell a new story!\" The judge passed on without replying, evidently  regarding it as beneath the dignity of the Supreme Court to delay  proceedings for the sake of a story.

In 1838 Lincoln was for a third time a candidate for the State  Legislature. Mr. Wilson, one of his colleagues from Sangamon County,  states that a question of the division of the county was one of the  local issues. \"Mr. Lincoln and myself,\" says Mr. Wilson, \"among others  residing in the portion of the county which sought to be organized into  a new county, opposed the division; and it became necessary that I  should make a special canvass through the northwest part of the county,  then known as Sand Ridge. I made the canvass. Mr. Lincoln accompanied  me, and being personally acquainted with everyone we called at nearly  every house. At that time it was the universal custom to keep some  whiskey in the house for private use and to treat friends. The subject  was always mentioned as a matter of politeness, but with the usual  remark to Mr. Lincoln, 'We know you never drink, but maybe your friend  would like to take a little.' I never saw Mr. Lincoln drink. He often  told me he never drank; had no desire for drink, nor for the  companionship of drinking men.\"    The result of this canvass was that Lincoln was elected to the  Legislature for the session of 1838-39. The next year he was elected  for the session of 1840-41. This ended his legislative service, which  comprised eight consecutive years, from 1834 to 1841. In these later  sessions he was as active and prominent in the House as he had been in  the earlier times when a member from New Salem.    Lincoln's faculty for getting the better of an adversary by an apt  illustration or anecdote was seldom better shown than by an incident  which occurred during his last term in the Legislature. Hon. James C.  Conkling has given the following graphic description of the scene: \"A  gentleman who had formerly been Attorney-General of the State was also a  member. Presuming upon his age, experience, and former official  position, he thought it incumbent upon himself to oppose Lincoln, who  was then one of the acknowledged leaders of his party. He at length  attracted the attention of Lincoln, who replied to his remarks, telling  one of his humorous anecdotes and making a personal application to his  opponent which placed the latter in such a ridiculous attitude that it  convulsed the whole House. All business was suspended. In vain the  Speaker rapped with his gavel. Members of all parties, without  distinction, were compelled to laugh. They not only laughed, they  screamed and yelled; they thumped upon the floor with their canes; they  clapped their hands and threw up their hats; they shouted and twisted  themselves into all sorts of contortions, until their sides ached and  the tears rolled down their cheeks. One paroxysm passed away, but was  speedily succeeded by another, and again they laughed and screamed and  yelled. Another lull occurred, and still another paroxysm, until they  seemed to be perfectly exhausted. The ambition of Lincoln's opponent was  abundantly gratified, and for the remainder of the session he lapsed  into profound obscurity.\"    In June, 1842, ex-President Van Buren was journeying through Illinois  with a company of friends. When near Springfield they were delayed by  bad roads, and were compelled to spend the night at Rochester, some  miles out. The accommodations at this place were very poor, and a few of  the ex-President's Springfield friends proposed to go out to meet him  and try to aid in entertaining him. Knowing Lincoln's ability as a  talker and story-teller, they begged him to go with them and aid in  making their guest at the country inn pass the evening as pleasantly as  possible. Lincoln, with his usual good nature, went with them, and  entertained the party for hours "]]]
