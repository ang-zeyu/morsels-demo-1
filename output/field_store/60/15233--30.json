One  horse, a magnificent grey who had been leading the others, fell dead as he  was leaping over a small gully, and his rider was thrown headlong to the  ground. Another horseman turned in his course, assisted the horseless  rider to his own brown steed, and the two were borne rapidly through the  storm of bullets towards the kopje. Another horse was killed when he had  carried his rider almost to the goal of safety, and the Boer was compelled  to traverse the remainder of the distance on foot. Apparently all the  burghers had escaped across the plain, and their field-cornet was  preparing to lead them to another position when a solitary horseman, a  mere speck of black against a background of brown, lifeless grass, issued  from a rocky ravine below the kopje occupied by the enemy, and plunged  into the open space. Lee-Metfords cracked and cut open the ground around  him, but the rider bent forward and seemed to become a part of his  horse. Every rod of progress seemed to multiply the fountains of dust near  him; every leap of his horse seemed necessarily his last. On, on he  dashed, now using his stirrups, now beating his horse with his hands. It  seemed as if he were making no progress, yet his horse's legs were moving  so swiftly. \"They will get him,\" sighed the field-cornet, looking through  his glasses. \"He has a chance,\" replied a burgher. Seconds dragged  wearily, the firing increased in volume, and the dust of the horse's heels  mingled with that raised by the bullets. The sound of the hoofs beating  down on the solid earth came louder and louder over the veld, the firing  slackened and then ceased, and a foaming, panting horse brought his burden  to where the burghers stood. The exhausted rider sank to the ground, and  men patted the neck and forehead of the quivering beast.    Down in the valley, near the spruit, the foreign military attaches in  uniforms quite distinct were watching the effect of the British artillery  on the saddle belonging to one of their number. \"They will never hit it,\"  volunteered one, as a shell exploded ten yards distant from the leathern  mark.    \"They must think it is a crowd of Boers,\" suggested another, when a dozen  shells had fallen without injuring the saddle. Fifteen, twenty tongues of  dust arose, but the leather remained unmarred by scratch or rent, and the  attaches became the target of the heavy guns. \"I am hit,\" groaned  Lieutenant Nix, of the Netherlands-Indian army, and his companions caught  him in their arms. Blood gushed from a wound in the shoulder, but the  soldier spirit did not desert him. \"Here, Demange!\" he called to the  French attache, \"Hold my head. And you, Thompson and Allen, see if you  cannot bind this shoulder.\" The Norwegian and Hollander bound the wound as  well as they were able. \"Reichman!\" the injured man whispered, \"I am going  to die in a few minutes, and I wish you would write a letter to my wife.\"  The American attache hastily procured paper and pencil, and while shells  and shrapnel were bursting over and around them the wounded man dictated a  letter to his wife in Holland. Blood flowed copiously from the wound and  stained the grass upon which he lay. He was pale as the clouds above him,  and the pain was agonising, but the dying man's letter was filled with  nothing but expressions of love and tenderness.    In the south-eastern part of the field a large party of cavalrymen was  speeding in the direction of Thaba N'Chu. On two sides of them, a thousand  yards behind, small groups of horsemen were giving chase. At a distance,  the riders appeared like ants slowly climbing the hillside. Now and then a  Boer rider suddenly stopped his horse, leaped to the ground, and fired at  the fleeing cavalrymen. A second afterwards he was on his horse again,  bending to the chase. Shot followed shot, but the distance between the  forces grew greater, and one by one the burghers turned their animals'  heads and slowly retraced their steps. A startled buck bounded over the  veld, two rifles were turned upon it, and its flight was ended.    [Illustration: CALLING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO MAN CAPTURED CANNON AFTER  SANNASPOST]    The sound of firing had ceased, and the battle was concluded. Waggons with  Red Cross flags fluttering from the tall staffs above them, issued from  the mountains and rumbled through the valleys. Burghers dashed over the  field in search of the wounded and dying. Men who a few moments before  were straining every nerve to kill their fellow-beings became equally  energetic to preserve lives. Wounded soldiers and burghers were lifted out  of the grass and carried tenderly to the ambulance waggons. The dead were  placed side by side, and the same cloth covered the bodies of Boer and  Briton. Men with spades upturned the earth, and stood grimly by while a  man in black prayed over the bodies of those who died for their country.    Boer officers, with pencils and paper in their hands, sped over the  battlefield from a group of prisoners to a line of passing waggons, and  made calculations concerning the result of the day's battle. Three Boers  killed and nine wounded was one side of the account. On the credit sheet  were marked four hundred and eight British soldiers, seven cannon, one  hundred and fifty waggons, five hundred and fifty rifles, two thousand  horses and cattle, and vast stores of ammunition and provisions captured  during the day.    In among the north-eastern hills, where a farmer's daub-and-wattle cottage  stood, were the prisoners of war, chatting and joking with their captors.  The officers walked slowly back and forth, never raising their eyes from  the ground. Dejection was written on their faces. Near them were the  captured waggons, with groups of noisy soldiers climbing over them in  search of their luggage. On the ground others were playing cards and  matching coins. Young Boers walked amongst them and engaged them in  conversation. Near the farmhouse stood a tall Cape Colony Boer talking  with his former neighbour, who was a prisoner. Several Americans among the  captured disputed the merits of the war with a Yankee burgher, who had  readily distinguished his countrymen among the throng. Some one began to  whistle a popular tune, others joined, and soon almost every one was  participating. An officer gave the order for the prisoners to fall in  line, and shortly afterward the men in brown tramped forward, while the  burghers stepped aside and lined the path. A soldier commenced to sing  another popular song, British and Boer caught the refrain, and the noise  of tramping feet was drowned by the melody of the united voices of friend  and foe singing--            \"It's the soldiers of the Queen, my lads,          Who've been, my lads--who've seen, my lads,                 *       *       *       *       *          We'll proudly point to every one          Of England's soldiers of the Queen.\"          CHAPTER VII    THE GENERALS OF THE WAR      The names and deeds of the men who led thirty thousand of their  fellow-peasants against almost a quarter of a million of the trained  troops of the greatest empire in the world, and husbanded their men and  resources so that they were enabled to continue the unequal struggle for  the greater part of a year will live for ever in the history of the Dark  Continent. When racial hatred and the bitternesses of the war have been  forgotten, and South Africa has emerged from its long period of bloodshed  and disaster, then all Afrikanders will revere the memory of the valiant  deeds of Cronje, Joubert, Botha, Meyer, De Wet, and the others who fought  so gallantly in a cause which they considered just and holy. Such noble  examples of heroism as Cronje's stand at Paardeberg, Botha's defence of  the Tugela and the region east of Pretoria; De Wet's warfare in the Free  State, and Meyer's fighting in the Transvaal will shine in African history  as long as the Southern Cross illumes the path of civilised people in that  region. When future generations search the pages of history for deeds of  valour they will turn to the records of the Boer-British war of 1899-1900,  and find that the military leaders of the farmers of South Africa were not  less valorous than those of the untrained followers of Cromwell or William  of Orange, the peace-loving mountaineers of Switzerland, or the patriotic  countrymen of Washington.    The leaders of the Boer forces were not generals in the popular sense of  the word. Almost without exception, they were men who had no technical  knowledge of warfare; men who were utterly without military training of  any nature, and who would have been unable to pass an examination for the  rank of corporal in a European army. Among the entire list of generals who  fought in the armies of the two Republics there were not more than three  who had ever read military works, and Cronje was the only one who ever  studied the theory and practice of modern warfare, and made an attempt to  apply the principles of it to his army. Every one of the Boer generals was  a farmer who, before the war, paid more attention to his crops and cattle  than he did to evolving ideas for application in a campaign, and the  majority of them, in fact, never dreamed that they would be called upon to  be military leaders until they were nominated for the positions a short  time before hostilities were commenced. Joubert, Cronje, Ferreira, and  Meyer were about the only men in the two Republics who were certain that  they would be called upon to lead their countrymen, for all had had  experience in former wars; but men like Botha, De Wet, De la Rey, and  Snyman, who occupied responsible positions afterward, had no such  assurance, and naturally gave little or no attention to the study of  military matters. The men who became"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#20)"],[1,"February, 1899.]    It is not altogether on M. d'Indy's musical gifts that I want to dwell.  It is known that in Europe to-day he is one of the masters of dramatic  musical expression, of orchestral colouring, and of the science of  style. But that is not the end of his attainments; he has artistic  originality, which springs from something deeper still. When an artist  has some worth, you will find it not only in his work but in his being.  So we will endeavour to explore M. d'Indy's being.    M. d'Indy's personality is not a mysterious one. On the contrary, it is  open and clear as daylight; and we see this in his musical work, in his  artistic activities, and in his writings. To his own writings we may  apply the exception of his rule about criticism in favour of a small  number of men whose thoughts are interesting even when they are  erroneous. It would be a pity indeed not to know M. d'Indy's  thoughts--even the erroneous ones; for they let us catch a glimpse, not  only of the ideas of an eminent artist, but of certain surprising  characteristics of the thought of our time. M. d'Indy has closely  studied the history of his art; but the chief interest of his writings  lies rather in their unconscious expression of the spirit of modern art  than in what they tell us about the past.    M. d'Indy is not a man hedged in by the boundaries of his art; his mind  is open and well fertilised. Musicians nowadays are no longer entirely  absorbed in their notes, but let their minds go out to other interests.  And it is not one of the least interesting phenomena of French music  to-day that gives us these learned and thoughtful composers, who are  conscious of what they create, and bring to their art a keen critical  faculty, like that of M. Saint-Saens, M. Dukas, or M. d'Indy. From M.  d'Indy we have had scholarly editions of Rameau, Destouches, and Salomon  de Rossi. Even in the middle of rehearsals of _L'Etranger_ at Brussels  he was working at a reconstruction of Monteverde's _Orfeo_. He has  published selections of folk-songs with critical notes, essays on  Beethoven's predecessors, a history of Musical Composition, and debates  and lectures. This fine intellectual culture is not, however, the most  remarkable of M. d'Indy's characteristics, though it may have been the  most remarked. Other musicians share this culture with him; and his real  distinction lies in his moral and almost religious qualities, and it is  this side of him that gives him an unusual interest for us among other  contemporary artists.           *       *       *       *       *        \"Maneant in vobis Fides, Spes, Caritas.      Tria haec: major autem horum est Caritas.         \"An artist must have at least Faith, faith in God and faith in his       art; for it is Faith that disposes him to _learn_, and by his       learning to raise himself higher and higher on the ladder of Being,       up to his goal, which is God.         \"An artist should practise Hope; for he can expect nothing from the       present; he knows that his mission is to _serve_, and to give his       work for the life and teaching of the generations that shall come       after him.         \"An artist should be inspired by a splendid Charity--'the greatest       of these.' To _love_ should be his aim in life; for the moving       principle of all creation is divine and charitable Love.\"    Who speaks like this? Is it the monk Denys in his cell at Mount Athos?  Or Cennini, who spread the pious teaching of the Giotteschi? Or one of  the old painters of Sienna, who in their profession of faith called  themselves \"by the grace of God, those who manifest marvellous things to  common and illiterate men, by the virtue of the holy faith, and to its  glory\"?    No; it was the director of the _Schola Cantorum_, addressing the  students in an inaugural speech, or giving them a lecture on  Composition.[140]    [Footnote 140: Vincent d'Indy: _Cours de Composition musicale_, Book I,  drawn up from notes taken in Composition classes at the _Schola  Cantorum_, 1897-1898, p. 16 (Durand, 1902). See also the inaugural  speech given at the school, and published by the _Tribune de  Saint-Gervais_, November, 1900.]    We must consider a little this singular book, where a living science and  a Gothic spirit are closely intermingled (I use the word \"Gothic\" in its  best sense; I know it is the highest praise one can give M. d'Indy).  This work has not received the attention it deserves. It is a record of  the spirit of contemporary art; and if it stands rather apart from other  writings, it should not be allowed to pass unnoticed on that account.    In this book, Faith is shown to be everything--the beginning and the  end. We learn how it fans the flame of genius, nourishes thought,  directs work, and governs even the modulations and the style of a  musician. There is a passage in it that one would think was of the  thirteenth century; it is curious, but not without dignity:         \"One should have an aim in the progressive march of modulations, as       one has in the different stages of life. The reason, instincts, and       faith that guide a man in the troubles of his life also guide the       musician in his choice of modulations. Thus useless and       contradictory modulations, an undecided balance between light and       shade, produce a painful and confusing impression on the hearer,       comparable to that which a poor human being inspires when he is       feeble and inconsistent, buffeted between the East and the West in       the course of his unhappy life, without an aim and without       belief.\"[141]    [Footnote 141: Vincent d'Indy, _Cours de Composition musicale_, p. 132.]    This book seems to be of the Middle Ages by reason of a sort of  scholastic spirit of abstraction and classification.         \"In artistic creation, seven faculties are called into play by the       soul: the Imagination, the Affections, the Understanding, the       Intelligence, the Memory, the Will, and the Conscience.\"[142]    [Footnote 142: _Id._, _ibid._, p. 13.]    And again its mediaeval spirit is shown by an extraordinary symbolism,  which discovers in everything (as far as I understand it) the imprint  of divine mysteries, and the mark of God in Three Persons in such things  as the beating of the heart and ternary rhythms--\"an admirable  application of the principle of the Unity of the Trinity\"![143]    From these remote times comes also M. d'Indy's method of writing  history, not by tracing facts back to laws, but by deducing, on the  contrary, facts from certain great general ideas, which have once been  admitted, but not proved by frequent recurrence, such as: \"The origin of  art is in religion\"[144]--a fact which is anything but certain. From  this reasoning it follows that folk-songs are derived from Gregorian  chants, and not the Gregorian chants from the folk-songs--as I would  sooner believe. The history of art may thus become a sort of history of  the world in moral achievement. One could divide it into two parts: the  world before the coming of Pride, and after it.    \"Subdued by the Christian faith, that formidable enemy of man, Pride,  rarely showed itself in the soul of an artist in the Middle Ages. But  with the weakening of religious belief, with the spirit of the  Reformation applying itself almost at the same time to every branch of  human learning, we see Pride reappear, and watch its veritable  Renaissance.\"[145]    [Footnote 143: _Id., ibid._, p. 25. In the thirteenth century, Philippe  de Vitry, Bishop of Meaux, called triple time \"perfect,\" because \"it  hath its name from the Trinity, that is to say, from the Father, the  Son, and the Holy Ghost, in whom is divine perfection.\"]    [Footnote 144: _Id., ibid._, pp. 66, 83, and _passim_.]    [Footnote 145: _Id., ibid._]    Finally, this Gothic spirit shows itself--in a less original way, it is  true--in M. d'Indy's religious antipathies, which, in spite of the  author's goodness of heart and great personal tolerance, constantly  break out against the two faiths that are rivals to his own; and to them  he attributes all the faults of art and all the vices of humanity. Each  has its offence. Protestantism is made responsible for the extremes of  individualism;[146] and Judaism, for the absurdities of its customs and  the weakness of its moral sense.[147] I do not know which of the two is  the more soundly belaboured; the second has the privilege of being so,  not only in writing, but in pictures.[148] The worst of it is, these  antipathies are apt to spoil the fairness of M. d'Indy's artistic  judgment. It goes without saying that the Jewish musicians are treated  with scant consideration; and even the great Protestant musicians,  giants in their art, do not escape rebuke. If Goudimel is mentioned, it  is because he was Palestrina's master, and his achievement of \"turning  the Calvinist psalms into chorales\" is dismissed as being of little  importance.[149]    [Footnote 146: \"Make war against Particularism, that unwholesome fruit  of the Protestant heresy!\" (Speech to the _Schola_, taken from the  _Tribune de Saint-Gervais_, November, 1900.)]    [Footnote 147: At least Judaism has the honour of giving its name to a  whole period of art, the \"Judaic period.\" \"The modern style is the last  phase of the Judaic school....\" etc.]    [Footnote 148: In the _Cours de Composition musicale_ M. d'Indy speaks  of \"the admirable initial T in the _Rouleau mortuaire_ of Saint-Vital  (twelfth century), which represents Satan vomiting two Jews ... an  expressive and symbolic work of art, if ever there was one.\" I should  not mention this but for the fact that there are only two illustrations  in the whole book.]    [Footnote 149: _Cours de Composition musicale_, p. 160.]    Haendel's oratorios are spoken of as \"chilling, and, frankly speaking,  tedious.\"[150] Bach himself escapes with this qualification: \"If he is  great, it is not because of,"]]]
