If sheet-iron is used, a coat of heavy  paint would prevent rust and therefore prolong the life of the  motor. The motor will soon pay for itself in the saving of laundry  bills. We used to spend $1 a month to have just my husband's  overalls done at the laundry, but now I put them in the machine,  start the motor, and leave them for an hour or so. At the end of  this time they are perfectly clean, and I have noticed that they  wear twice as long as when I sent them to the laundry.        ** How to Make Silhouettes [68]    Photography in all branches is truly a most absorbing occupation.  Each of us who has a camera is constantly experimenting, and  everyone of us is delighted when something new is suggested for  such experiments.    [Illustration: Making a Silhouette with the Camera]    To use a camera in making silhouettes select a window facing north  if possible, or if used only at times when the sun is not on it,  any window will do, says the Photographic Times. Raise the window  shade half way, remove any white curtains there may be, and in the  center of the lower pane of glass paste by the four corners a  sheet of tissue paper that is perfectly smooth and quite thick, as  shown in the sketch at B. Darken the rest of the window, shutting  out all light from above and the sides. Place a chair so that  after being seated the head of the subject will come before the  center of the tissue paper, and as near to it as possible, and  when looking straight before him his face will be in clear profile  to the camera.    Draw the shades of all other windows in the room. Focus the camera  carefully, getting a sharp outline of the profile on the screen.  Do not stop down the lens, as this makes long exposure necessary,  and the subject may move. Correct exposure depends, of course, on  the lens, light and the plate. But remember that a black and white  negative is wanted with as little detail in the features as  possible. The best plate to use is a very slow one, or what is  called a process plate.    [Illustration: Sample Silhouette]    In developing get all possible density in the high lights, without  detail in the face, and without fog. Printing is best done on  contrasty development paper with developer not too strong.    The ideal silhouette print is a perfectly black profile on a white  ground. With a piece of black paper, any shape in stopping off  print may be made as shown at C in the sketch.        ** How to Make a Galvanoscope [68]    A galvanoscope for detecting small currents of electricity can be  made from a coil of wire, A; a glass tube, B, full of water; a  core, C; and a base, D, with binding posts as shown. The core C,  which is made of iron and cork, is a trifle lighter than the water  it displaces and will therefore normally remain in the top of the  tube; but as soon as a current of electricity passes through the  coil, the core is drawn down out of sight. The current required is  very small, as the core is so nearly balanced that the least  attraction will cause it to sink.    The glass tube may be a test tube, as shown in Fig. 2, or an empty  developer tube. If one has neither a test tube nor developer tube,  an empty pill bottle may be used. The washers at the ends of the  coil can be made of fiber, hard rubber, or wood; or can be taken  from an old magnet. The base may be made of wood or any other  insulating material and should have four short legs on the bottom.  Make the coil of single-covered wire about No. 18 and connect ends  to binding posts as shown in Fig. 2.    The core is made by pushing a small nail through a piece of cork.  It should be made so that it will rise slowly when placed under  water. Some filing may be necessary to get the weight just right,  but it should be remembered that the buoyancy of the core can be  adjusted after the parts are assembled, by pressing the cork in  the bottom of the test tube. This causes compression in the water  so that some is forced into the upper cork, reducing its  displacement and causing it to sink. The lower cork is then slowly  withdrawn, by twisting, until the core slowly rises.    [Illustration: Galvanoscope]    The instrument will then be adjusted ready for use. Connect the  binding posts to a single cell of battery--any kind will do, as a  slight current will answer. On completing    [Illustration: Interior View]    the circuit the core will descend; or put in a switch or push  button on one of the battery wires. If the button be concealed  where the operator can reach it, the core will obey his command to  rise or fall, according to his control of the current. This is a  mysterious looking instrument, the core being moved without  visible connection to any other part.        ** Lubricating Sheet Metal [69]    To lubricate sheet metal mix 1 qt. whale oil, 1 lb. white lead, 1  pt. water and 3 oz. finest graphite. Apply with a brush before the  metal enters the dies.        ** An Optical Top [69]    One of the latest optical delusions, and one not easy to explain,  is Benham's color top. Cut out the black and white disk shown in  the figure, and paste on a piece of stiff cardboard. Trim the  edges of the cardboard to match the shape of the disk, and make a  pinhole in the center. Cut the pin in half and push it through  from the under side until the head of the pin touches the  cardboard. Spin slowly in a strong light and some of the lines  will appear colored. The colors appear different to different  people, and are changed by reversing the rotation.    [Illustration: An Optical Top]        ** Card Trick with a Tapered Deck [70]    Another simple trick to perform but one not easily detected, is  executed by using a tapered deck of cards as shown in Fig. 1. A  cheap deck of cards is evened up square, fastened in a vise and  planed along the edge in such a manner that all the pack will be  tapered about 1/16 in. This taper is exaggerated in the  illustration which shows    [Illustration: Cards from a Tapered Deck]    one card that has been turned end for end.    It is evident that any card reversed in this way can be easily  separated from the other cards in the pack, which makes it  possible to perform the following trick: The performer spreads the  cards out, fan-like, and asks an observer to withdraw a card,  which is then replaced in any part of the pack. After thoroughly  shuffling the cards the performer then holds the deck in both  hands behind his back and pronouncing a few magic words, produces  the card selected in one hand and the rest of the pack in the  other. This is accomplished by simply turning the deck end for end  while the observer is looking at his card, thus bringing the wide  end of the selected card at the narrow end of the pack when it is  replaced. The hands are placed behind the pack for a double  purpose, as the feat then seems more marvelous and the observers  are not allowed to see how it is done.    In prize games, players having the same score are frequently  called upon to cut for low to determine which shall be the winner,  but a fairer way is to cut for high as a person familiar with the  trick shown in Fig. 2 can cut the cards at the ace, deuce, or  three spot, nearly every time, especially if the deck is a new  one. This is done by simply pressing on the top of the deck as  shown, before cutting, thus causing the increased ink surface of  the high cards to adhere to the adjacent ones. A little practice  will soon enable one to cut low nearly every time, but the cards  must be grasped lightly and the experiment should be performed  with a new deck to obtain successful results.  --Contributed by D.B.L., Chicago.        ** A Constant-Pressure Hydrogen Generator [70]    By fitting three bottles, A, B, C, with rubber stoppers and  connecting with glass tubes as shown in the sketch, hydrogen or  other gases produced in a similar manner may be generated under  constant pressure. In making hydrogen, bottle B is partly filled  with zinc nodules formed by slowly pouring melted zinc into water.  Hydrochloric acid is then poured in the small funnel, thus partly  filling bottles A and C. When the acid rising from C comes in  contact with the zinc, hydrogen gas is generated and fills bottle  B. The gas continues to generate until the pressure is sufficient  to force the acid back down the tube into bottle C, when the  action ceases. As fast as the gas is used the acid rises in the  tube and generates more, thus keeping the pressure nearly  constant, the pressure depending on the difference between the  levels of the acid in bottle A and bottle B. As this device is  easily upset, a ring-stand should be used to prevent its being  broken, or if it is to be a permanent apparatus it may be mounted  on a substantial wooden base. This apparatus may also be used for  preparing acetylene gas or almost any gas which requires a mixture  of a solid and liquid in its preparation.  --Contributed by C. S. J., Detroit.        ** Restoring Tone to a Cracked Bell [71]    Many a bell with a deadened tone due to a cracked rim, can be  given its original clear ringing sound by sawing out the crack  with a common hacksaw. Make the saw cut along the line of the  crack. The opening caused by the saw will allow the free vibration  of the metal.  --Contributed by F. W. Bently, Jr., Huron, S.

Form a  cone of heavy paper, 9 in. long and 3 in. in diameter, at the  larger end with the smaller end to fit the diameter of the tube A,  making it three-ply thick and gluing the layers together.

The whole number of members in the  assembly of Upper Canada was not to be less than sixteen; in Lower  Canada not less than fifty--to be chosen by a majority of votes in  either case. The British parliament reserved to itself the right of  levying and collecting customs-duties, for the regulation of navigation  and commerce to be carried on between the two provinces, or between  either of them and any other part of the British dominions or any  foreign country. Parliament also reserved the power of directing the  payment of these duties, but at the same time left the exclusive  apportionment of all moneys levied in this way to the legislature, which  could apply them to such public uses as it might deem expedient. The  free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion was guaranteed permanently.  The king was to have the right to set apart, for the use of the  Protestant clergy in the colony, a seventh part of all uncleared crown  lands. The governor might also be empowered to erect parsonages and  endow them, and to present incumbents or ministers of the Church of  England. The English criminal law was to obtain in both provinces.    In the absence of Lord Dorchester in England, the duty devolved on  Major-General Alured Clarke, as lieutenant-governor, to bring the Lower  Canadian constitution into force by a proclamation on the 18th February,  1791. On the 7th May, in the following year, the new province of Lower  Canada was divided into fifty electoral districts, composed of  twenty-one counties, the towns of Montreal and Quebec, and the boroughs  of Three Rivers and William Henry (now Sorel). The elections to the  assembly took place in June, and a legislative council of fifteen  influential Canadians was appointed. The new legislature was convoked  \"for the despatch of business\" on the 17th December, in the same year,  in an old stone building known as the Bishop's Palace, which stood on a  rocky eminence in the upper town of the old capital.    Chief Justice Smith took the chair of the legislative council under  appointment by the crown, and the assembly elected as its speaker Mr.  Joseph Antome Panet, an eminent advocate, who was able to speak the two  languages. In the house there were only sixteen members of British  origin--and in later parliaments there was even a still smaller  representation--while the council was nearly divided between the two  nationalities. When the house proceeded to business, one of its first  acts was to order that all motions, bills and other proceedings should  be put in the two languages. We find in the list of French Canadian  members of the two houses representatives of the most ancient and  distinguished families of the province. A descendant of Pierre Boucher,  governor of Three Rivers in 1653, and the author of a rare history of  Canada, sat in the council of 1792 just as a Boucherville sits  now-a-days in the senate of the Dominion. A Lotbiniere had been king's  councillor in 1680. A Chaussegros de Lery had been an engineer in the  royal colonial corps; a Lanaudiere had been an officer in the Carignan  regiment in 1652; a Salaberry was a captain in the royal navy, and his  family won further honours on the field of Chateauguay in the war of  1812-15, when the soil of Lower Canada was invaded. A Taschereau had  been a royal councillor in 1732. The names of Belestre, Valtric, Bonne,  Rouville, St. Ours, and Duchesnay, are often met in the annals of the  French regime, and show the high character of the representation in the  first parliament of Lower Canada.    The village of Newark was chosen as the capital of Upper Canada by  Colonel (afterwards Major-General) Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor  of the province. He had served with much distinction during the  revolution as the commander of the Queen's Rangers, some of whom had  settled in the Niagara district. He was remarkable for his decision of  character and for his ardent desire to establish the principles of  British government in the new province. He was a sincere friend of the  Loyalists, whose attachment to the crown he had had many opportunities  of appreciating during his career in the rebellious colonies, and,  consequently, was an uncompromising opponent of the new republic and of  the people who were labouring to make it a success on the other side of  the border. The new parliament met in a wooden building nearly completed  on the sloping bank of the river, at a spot subsequently covered by a  rampart of Fort George, which was constructed by Governor Simcoe on the  surrender of Fort Niagara. A large boulder has been placed on the top of  the rampart to mark the site of the humble parliament house of Upper  Canada, which had to be eventually demolished to make place for new  fortifications. The sittings of the first legislature were not  unfrequently held under a large tent set up in front of the house, and  having an interesting history of its own, since it had been carried  around the world by the famous navigator, Captain Cook.    As soon as Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe assumed the direction of the  government, he issued a proclamation dividing the province of Upper  Canada into nineteen counties, some of winch were again divided into  ridings for the purpose of electing the sixteen representatives to which  the province was entitled under the act of 1791. One of the first acts  of the legislature was to change the names of the divisions, proclaimed  in 1788, to Eastern, Midland, Home, and Western Districts, which  received additions in the course of years until they were entirely  superseded by the county organisations. These districts were originally  intended for judicial and legal purposes.    The legislature met under these humble circumstances at Newark on the  17th September, 1792. Chief Justice Osgoode was the speaker of the  council, and Colonel John Macdonell, of Aberchalder, who had gallantly  served in the royal forces during the revolution, was chosen presiding  officer of the assembly. Besides him, there were eleven Loyalists among  the sixteen members of the lower house. In the council of nine members  there were also several Loyalists, the most prominent being the  Honourable Richard Cartwright, the grandfather of the minister of trade  and commerce in the Dominion ministry of 1896-1900.      SECTION 2.--Twenty years of political development (1792-1812).    The political conditions of the two decades from 1792 until 1812, when  war broke out between England and the United States, were for the  greater part of the time quite free from political agitation, and the  representatives of the people in both the provinces of Canada were  mostly occupied with the consideration of measures of purely provincial  and local import. Nevertheless a year or two before the close of this  period we can see in the province of Lower Canada premonitions of that  irrepressible conflict between the two houses--one elected by the  people and the other nominated by and under the influence of the  crown--which eventually clogged the machinery of legislation. We can  also see the beginnings of that strife of races which ultimately led to  bloodshed and the suspension of the constitution given to Lower Canada  in 1791.    In 1806 _Le Canadien_, published in the special interest of \"Nos  institutions, notre langue, et nos lois,\" commenced that career of  bitter hostility to the government which steadily inflamed the  antagonism between the races. The arrogance of the principal officials,  who had the ear of the governor, and practically engrossed all the  influence in the management of public affairs, alienated the French  Canadians, who came to believe that they were regarded by the British as  an inferior race. As a matter of fact, many of the British inhabitants  themselves had no very cordial feelings towards the officials, whose  social exclusiveness offended all who did not belong to their special  \"set.\" In those days the principal officials were appointed by the  colonial office and the governor-general, and had little or no respect  for the assembly, on which they depended in no wise for their  continuance in office or their salaries. The French Canadians eventually  made few distinctions among the British but looked on them as, generally  speaking, enemies to their institutions.    It was unfortunate, at a time when great discretion and good temper were  so essential, that Sir James Craig should have been entrusted with the  administration of the government of Lower Canada. The critical state of  relations with the United States no doubt influenced his appointment,  which, from a purely military point of view, was excellent. As it was,  however, his qualities as a soldier were not called into requisition,  while his want of political experience, his utter incapacity to  understand the political conditions of the country, his supreme  indifference to the wishes of the assembly, made his administration an  egregious failure. Indeed it may he said that it was during his time  that the seed was sown for the growth of that political and racial  antagonism which led to the rebellion of 1837. It is not possible to  exaggerate the importance of the consequences of his unjustifiable  dismissal of Mr. Speaker Panet, and other prominent French Canadians,  from the militia on the ground that they had an interest in the  _Canadien_, or of his having followed up this very indiscreet act by the  unwarrantable arrest of Mr. Bedard and some other persons, on the charge  that they were the authors or publishers of what he declared to be  treasonable writings. It is believed that the governor's action was  largely influenced by the statements and advice of Chief Justice Sewell,  the head of the legislative council and the official class. Several  persons were released when they expressed regret for the expression of  any opinions considered extreme by the governor and"]]]
