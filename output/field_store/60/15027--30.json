The young man gladly accepted the coat, wondering a little at  the wisdom of the Lord in clothing him at the expense of his brother,  who was not particularly interested in the Lord's work, and who was so  much larger than he was, that nothing short of the wisdom of Providence  could have made a coat that was measured for one of them ever to fit the  other.\"    This was the return that God made to him for his sacrifice to the Lord.  _Never withhold from the Lord_.      PRAYING TO STOP THE WIND AND THE SAILING OF A VESSEL.      The late aged and venerable Rev. Dr. Cleaveland, of Boston, relates the  following incident:    \"In a revival of religion in the church of which he was pastor, he was  visited one morning by a member of his church, a widow, whose only son  was a sailor. With a voice trembling with emotion, she said, 'Doctor  Cleaveland, I have called to entreat you to join me in praying _that the  wind may change_.' He looked at her in silent amazement. 'Yes,' she  exclaimed, earnestly, 'my son has gone on board his vessel; they sail  to-night, unless the wind changes.' 'Well, madam,' replied the doctor,  'I will pray that your son may be converted on this voyage; but to pray  that God would alter the laws of His universe on his account, I fear is  presumptuous.' 'Doctor,' she replied, 'my heart tells me differently.  God's Spirit is _here_. Souls are being converted here. You have a  meeting this evening, and, if the wind would change, John would stay and  go to it; and, I believe, if he went he would be converted. Now, if you  cannot join me, I must pray alone, for he must stay.' 'I will pray for  his conversion,' said the doctor.    \"On his way to the meeting, he glanced at the weather-vane, and, to his  surprise, _the wind had changed_, and it was blowing landward. On  entering his crowded vestry, he soon observed John, sitting upon the  front seat. The young man seemed to drink in every word, rose to be  prayed for, and attended the inquiry meeting. When he sailed from port,  the mother's prayers had been answered; he went a Christian. The pastor  had learned a lesson he never forgot. The Lord had said, 'O, woman,  great is thy faith; be it unto thee, even as thou wilt.' God answered  that prayer because the mother was seeking to advance His own kingdom.  God always hears a prayer that will in any way bring a soul to the  Lord.\"      INSANITY CURED AND SUICIDE PREVENTED.      \"_Augusta Moore_, writes _The Christian_, of a young lady called home by  the illness of her widowed mother, who died before she could reach her.  This alone was a terrible shock to the delicate daughter, who, having  been reared in luxury, was ill-fitted for firm endurance of calamity.  But, when it became known that a relative, in whom she had placed  confidence, had managed, in ways that need not be explained, to defraud  her out of her inheritance, her mind gave way and _she became insane_.    \"For years, her distressed husband strove in every way to restore her  reason, but she seemed rather to become worse, and showed signs of  intentions to commit suicide; and her family and friends lived in a  wretched state of apprehension. In spite of the most faithful  watchfulness, she twice succeeded in securing the means for  self-destruction, but something prevented her from accomplishing her  design. At last, it occurred to a friend to present this woman's case in  the prayer-meeting, to the Lord, and earnest prayer was offered for her  restoration.    \"No immediate result appeared; but the friends _persevered_. During the  Winter, a revival of religion occurred in the town where she dwelt, and,  with much difficulty, the insane woman, who declared that she was  utterly and finally forsaken by God, was prevailed upon to attend the  meetings. They began immediately to have a good effect upon her. She  could sleep better; she grew more cheerful, and, in a short time, her  reason returned to her. A happier, or more grateful woman than she now  is, no mortal eyes ever beheld, and she affords one more instance of the  Lord's willingness to hear and answer fervent prayer.\"      ANSWERS TO PRAYER.      Dr. Newman Hall, minister of Surrey Chapel, London, gives the following  instances of answers to prayer from his own experience:    \"The writer's brother, when superintendent of a Sunday School, felt a  strong impulse, one Saturday evening, to call on a member of his  Bible-class, whom he had never visited before, and to inquire if he was  in any need. He found him very ill. Though the mother and sister seemed  in comfortable circumstances, he felt constrained to inquire if he could  aid them in any way. They burst into tears, and said that the young man  had been asking for food which they had no power to supply, and that, on  Monday, some of their goods were to be taken in default of the payment  of rates. When he knocked at the door _they were on their knees in  prayer for help to be sent them_. By the aid of a few friends, the  difficulty was at once met--but the timely succor was felt to be the  divine response to prayer.    \"With that brother, the writer was once climbing the Cima di Jazzi, one  of the mountains in the chain of Monte Rosa. When nearly at the top,  they entered a dense fog. Presently, the guides faced right about, and  grounded their axes on the frozen snow-slope. The brother--seeing the  slope still beyond, and not knowing it was merely the cornice,  overhanging a precipice of several thousand feet--rushed onward. The  writer will never forget their cry of agonized warning. His brother  stood a moment on the very summit, and then, the snow yielding, began to  fall through. One of the guides, at great risk, rushed after him and  seized him by the coat. This tore away, leaving only three inches of  cloth, by which he was dragged back. It seemed impossible to be nearer  death, and yet escape. On his return home, an invalid member of his  congregation told him that she had been much in prayer for his safety,  and mentioned a special time when she particularly was earnest, as if  imploring deliverance from some great peril. _The times corresponded!_  Was not that prayer instrumental in preserving that life?\"      BISHOP SIMPSON'S RECOVERY.      Bishop Bowman gives the following instance from his own experience:    \"In the Fall of 1858, whilst visiting Indiana, I was at an annual  conference where Bishop Janes presided. We received a telegram that  Bishop Simpson was dying. Said Bishop Janes, 'Let us spend a few  moment's in earnest prayer for the recovery of Bishop Simpson.' We  kneeled to pray. William Taylor, the great California street preacher,  was called to pray, and such a prayer I never heard since. The  impression seized upon me irresistibly, _Bishop Simpson will not die_. I  rose from my knees perfectly quiet. Said I, 'Bishop Simpson will not  die.' 'Why do you think so?' Because I have had an _irresistible  impression_ made upon my mind during this prayer.' Another said, '_I  have the same impression_.' We passed it along from bench to bench,  until we found that a very large proportion of the conference had the  same impression. I made a minute of the time of day, and when I next saw  Simpson, he was attending to his daily labor. I inquired of the Bishop,  'How did you recover from your sickness?' He replied, '_I cannot tell_.'  'What did your physician say?' '_He said it was a miracle_.' I then said  to the Bishop, 'Give me the time and circumstances under which the  change occurred.' He fixed upon the day, and _the very hour_, making  allowance for the distance--a thousand miles away--that the preachers  were engaged in prayer at this conference. The physician left his room  and said to his wife, '_It is useless to do anything further; the Bishop  must die_.' In about an hour, he returned and started back, inquiring,  '_What have you done?' 'Nothing,'_ was the reply. 'He is recovering  rapidly,' said the physician; '_a change has occurred in the disease  within the last hour beyond anything I have ever seen; the crisis is  past, and the Bishop will recover_.' And he did.\"    The doctor was puzzled; it was beyond all the course and probabilities  of nature and the laws of science. What was it that made those ministers  so sure--what was it that made the patient recover, at the exact hour  that they prayed? There is only one answer, \"_The ever living Power of a  Superior Spirit which rules the world_.\"      THE SEVEN LETTERS.      The following incident is given by \"_The Presbyterian_,\" on the  authority of a private letter from Paris:    \"At a Bible reunion, held at the house of an English Congregationalist  minister, where several colporteurs, teachers and others meet for  devotional reading and conversation, a brief anecdote was related by a  clergyman living in La Force, who established there an institution for  epileptics, where he has now three hundred, supported entirely on the  principle of faith, like Muller's orphanage.    \"At one time, he found himself in debt to the amount of five hundred  pounds. After a sleepless, anxious night, he found, on his table, seven  letters. Opening five, he found them to be all applications, some of  them most painful in their details, for the admission of new inmates.  His excited mind could not bear it. Without opening the other two  letters he threw them to his wife. 'Put them into the fire,' he said,  and turned to seek relief in the open air. 'John,' said a sweet voice,  'this won't do. Come back.' So he did, taking up the sixth letter, which  proved to be from a stranger, enclosing a check for three hundred  pounds. The other envelope gave him just what was needed, just that and  no more.

Sir Francis refused to do so, and fired a gun in token of  defiance. Soon a train was seen approaching in the distance, and four  guns were dragged by the enemy to a point of high ground near the  castle. Here the Roundheads began to throw up a battery, but were  mightily inconvenienced while doing so by the guns of the castle, which  shot briskly against them. Working at night, however, in two days they  completed the battery, which, on the third morning, opened fire upon the  castle. The guns were much heavier than those upon the walls, and the  shot, directed at a curtain between two towers, battered the stone  sorely. The Parliament footmen were drawn back a space from the walls so  as to avoid the fire of muskets from the defenders. There were in all in  the castle about two hundred men, one hundred having been collected  before the arrival of the troops of horse. These determined upon making  a desperate resistance when the wall should give way, which would, they  doubted not, be upon the following day. Everything that could be done  was tried to hinder the destruction made by the enemy's shot. Numbers of  sacks were filled with earth, and lowered from the walls above so as to  hang in regular order before it, and so break the force of the shot.  This had some effect, but gradually the wall crumbled beneath the blows  of the missiles from the Roundhead guns.    \"We are useless here, save as footmen,\" Harry said that night to his  host. \"There is a postern gate, is there not, behind the castle?  Methinks that if we could get out in the dark unobserved, and form close  to the walls, so that their pickets lying around might not suspect us of  purposing to issue forth, we might, when daylight dawned, make an attack  upon their guns, and if we could spike these the assault would probably  cease.\"    The attempt was determined upon. The Roundhead infantry were disposed  behind as well as in front of the castle, so as to prevent the escape of  the besieged; but the camp was at a distance of some four hundred yards.  The chains of the drawbridge across the moat were oiled, as were the  bolts of the doors, and at three in the morning the gate was opened, and  the drawbridge lowered across the moat. A thick layer of sacks was then  placed upon the drawbridge. The horses' hoofs were also muffled with  sacking, and then, one by one, the horses were led out, the drawbridge  was drawn up again, and all was quiet. No sound or motion in the Puritan  camp betrayed that their exit was observed, and they could hear the  challenges of the circuit of sentries passed from man to man.    When the first streak of dawn was seen in the east the troop mounted  their horses, and remained quiet until the light should be sufficient to  enable them to see the nature of the ground over which they would have  to pass. This they would be able to do before they themselves were  observed, standing as they were close under the shadow of the walls of  the castle. As soon as it was sufficiently light the trumpets sounded,  and with a burst they dashed across the country. Heeding not the bugle  calls in the camp of the Puritan infantry, they rode straight at the  guns. These were six hundred yards distant, and before the artillerymen  could awake to their danger, the Royalists were upon them. Those that  stood were cut down, and in a minute the guns were spiked. Then the  cavalry swept round, and as the Puritan horse hastily formed up, they  charged them. Although but half their numbers, they had the superiority  in the surprise at which they took their foes, and in the fact of the  latter being but half armed, not having had time to put on their  breastplates. The combat was a short one, and in a few minutes the  Puritans were flying in all directions. The pikemen were now approaching  on either side in compact bodies, and against these Harry knew that his  horsemen could do nothing. He therefore drew them off from the castle,  and during the day circled round and round the place, seizing several  carts of provisions destined for the wants of the infantry, and holding  them in a sort of leaguer.    That night, finding that their guns were disabled, their horse defeated,  and themselves cut off, the rebel infantry drew off, and gave up the  siege of the place. The next morning the cavalry re-entered the castle  in triumph, and having received the hearty thanks of Sir Francis  Burdett, and leaving with him the troop of Master Chillingworth, who  intended to remain there, Harry proceeded on his way north, and reached  York without further adventure.    During the ten days that they had journeyed together Lady Sidmouth had  been greatly pleased with the attention and character of Harry Furness.  He was always cheerful and courteous, without any of that light tone of  flippancy which distinguished the young Cavaliers of the period, and her  little daughter was charmed with her companion. Harry received the  hearty thanks of Sir Henry Sidmouth for the care with which he had  conducted his wife through the dangers of the journey, and then, having  so far discharged his duty, he left his troop at York, and started for  Scotland.    On the way he had discussed with Jacob the measures which he intended to  take for his journey north. Jacob had begged earnestly to accompany him,  and as Harry deemed that his shrewdness might be of great use, he  determined to take him with him, as well as another of his troop. The  latter was a merry fellow, named William Long. He was of grave and sober  demeanor, and never smiled, even while causing his hearers to be  convulsed with laughter. He had a keen sense of humor, was a  ready-witted and courageous fellow, and had frequently distinguished  himself in the various skirmishes. He was the son of a small tenant of  Sir Henry Furness.    His farm was near the hall, and, although three or four years older  than Harry, he had as a boy frequently accompanied him when out hawking,  and in other amusements. Harry felt that, with two attached and faithful  comrades like these, he should he able to make his way through many  dangers. At York he had procured for himself and his followers suits of  clothes of a grave and sober cut, such as would be worn by yeomen; and  here they laid aside their Cavalier garments, and proceeded northward.  They traveled quietly forward as far as Durham, and then went west, as  Berwick was held for the Parliament. They carried weapons, for at that  time none traveled unarmed, and the country through which they had to  pass was greatly disturbed, the moss troopers having taken advantage of  the disorders of the times to renew the habits of their forefathers, and  to make raids upon their southern neighbors, and carry off cattle and  horses. They carried with them but little money, a small quantity in  their valises, and a few gold pieces concealed about their persons, each  choosing a different receptacle, so that in case of pillage some at  least might retain sufficient to carry them on their way. Avoiding the  large towns, where alone they would be likely to be questioned, they  crossed the border, and rode into Scotland.    Upon the day after their crossing the frontier they saw a body of  horsemen approaching them. These drew up when they reached them, Harry  having previously warned his comrades to offer no resistance, as the  party were too strong for them, and his mission was too important to  allow the king's cause to be hazarded by any foolish acts of pugnacity.    \"Are you for the king or the kirk?\" the leader asked.    \"Neither for one nor the other,\" Harry said. \"We are peaceable yeomen  traveling north to buy cattle, and we meddle not in the disputes of the  time.\"    \"Have you any news from the south?\"    \"Nothing,\" Harry replied. \"We come from Durham, and since the news of  the battle of Newbury, no tidings have come of importance.\"    The man looked inquisitively at the horses and valises; but Harry had  chosen three stout ponies sufficiently good to carry them, but offering  no temptations to pillagers, and the size of the valises promised but  little from their contents.    \"Since you are riding north to buy cattle,\" the leader said, \"you must  have money with you, and money is short with us in these bad times.\"    \"We have not,\" Harry said; \"judging it possible that we might meet with  gentlemen who felt the pressure of the times, we have provided ourselves  with sufficient only to take us up to Kelso, where dwells our  correspondent, who will, we trust, have purchased and collected  sufficient cattle for us to take south when we shall learn that a convoy  of troops is traveling in this direction, for we would not place  temptation in the way of those whom we might meet.\"    \"You are a fellow of some humor,\" the leader said grimly. \"But it is  evil jesting on this side of the border.\"    \"I jest not,\" Harry said. \"There is a proverb in Latin, with which  doubtless your worship is acquainted, to the effect that an empty  traveler may sing before robbers, and, although far from including you  and your worshipful following in that category, yet we may be pardoned  for feeling somewhat light-hearted, because we are not overburdened with  money.\"    The leader looked savagely at the young man; but seeing that his  demeanor and that of his followers was resolute, that they carried  pistols at their holsters and heavy swords, and deeming that nothing but  hard knocks would come of an attack upon them, he surlily bade his  company follow him, and rode on his way again.          CHAPTER X.    THE COMMISSIONER OF THE CONVENTION.      At Kelso Harry procured changes of garments, attiring himself as a  Lowland farmer, and his companions as two drovers. They were, as before,  mounted; but the costume of English farmers could no longer have been  supported by any plausible story. They learned that upon"]]]
