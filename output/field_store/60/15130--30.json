At the  gate of the wall they dismounted, and waited while the warden carried  the intelligence of their arrival to the family. A moment later, and the  Baron's son advanced from the porch, and from the open window the  Baroness and Aurora beckoned to them.          CHAPTER VIII    THYMA CASTLE      Soon afterwards the hollow sound of the warden's horn, from the watch  over the gate of the wall, proclaimed the hour of noon, and they all  assembled for dinner in the banqueting chamber. The apartment was on the  ground floor, and separated from the larger hall only by an internal  wall. The house, erected in the time of the ancients, was not designed  for our present style of life; it possessed, indeed, many comforts and  conveniences which are scarcely now to be found in the finest palaces,  but it lacked the breadth of construction which our architects have now  in view.    In the front there were originally only two rooms, extensive for those  old days, but not sufficiently so for ours. One of these had therefore  been enlarged, by throwing into it a back room and part of the entrance,  and even then it was not long enough for the Baron's retainers, and at  feast-time a wooden shed was built opposite, and up to the window, to  continue, as it were, the apartment out of doors. Workmen were busy  putting up this shed when they arrived.    The second apartment retained its ancient form, and was used as the  dining-room on ordinary days. It was lighted by a large window, now  thrown wide open that the sweet spring air might enter, which window was  the pride of the Baroness, for it contained more true glass than any  window in the palace of the Prince. The glass made now is not  transparent, but merely translucent; it indeed admits light after a  fashion, but it is thick and cannot be seen through. These panes were  almost all (the central casement wholly) of ancient glass, preserved  with the greatest care through the long years past.    Three tables were arranged in an open square; the Baron and Baroness's  chairs of oak faced the window, the guests sat at the other tables  sideways to them, the servants moved on the outer side, and thus placed  the food before them without pushing against or incommoding them. A  fourth table was placed in a corner between the fireplace and the  window. At it sat the old nurse, the housekeeper (frequently arising to  order the servants), and the Baron's henchman, who had taught him to  ride, but now, grey and aged, could not mount himself without  assistance, and had long ceased from active service.    Already eight or nine guests had arrived besides Felix and Oliver. Some  had ridden a great distance to be present at the House Day. They were  all nobles, richly dressed; one or two of the eldest were wealthy and  powerful men, and the youngest was the son and heir of the Earl of  Essiton, who was then the favourite at Court. Each had come with his  personal attendants; the young Lord Durand brought with him twenty-five  retainers, and six gentlemen friends, all of whom were lodged in the  town, the gentlemen taking their meals at the castle at the same time as  the Baron, but, owing to lack of room, in another apartment by  themselves. Durand was placed, or rather, quietly helped himself to a  seat, next to the Lady Aurora, and of all the men there present,  certainly there was none more gallant and noble than he.    His dark eyes, his curling hair short but brought in a thick curl over  his forehead, his lips well shaped, his chin round and somewhat  prominent, the slight moustache (no other hair on the face), formed the  very ideal of what many women look for in a man. But it was his bright,  lively conversation, the way in which his slightly swarthy complexion  flushed with animation, the impudent assurance and yet generous warmth  of his manner, and, indeed, of his feelings, which had given him the  merited reputation of being the very flower of the nobles.    With such a reputation, backed with the great wealth and power of his  father, gentlemen competed with each other to swell his train; he could  not, indeed, entertain all that came, and was often besieged with almost  as large a crowd as the Prince himself. He took as his right the chair  next to Aurora, to whom, indeed, he had been paying unremitting  attention all the morning. She was laughing heartily as she sat down, at  some sally of his upon a beauty at the Court.    The elder men were placed highest up the tables, and nearest the host,  but to the astonishment of all, and not the least of himself, Oliver was  invited by the Baron to sit by his side. Oliver could not understand  this special mark of favour; the others, though far too proud for a  moment to resent what they might have deemed a slight upon them, at once  began to search their minds for a reason. They knew the Baron as an old  intriguer; they attached a meaning, whether intended or not, to his  smallest action.    Felix, crowded out, as it were, and unnoticed, was forced to take his  seat at the end of the table nearest that set apart in the corner for  the aged and honoured servitors of the family. Only a few feet  intervened between him and ancient henchmen; and he could not but  overhear their talk among themselves, whispered as it was. He had merely  shaken hands with Aurora; the crowd in the drawing-room and the marked  attentions of Durand had prevented the exchange of a single word between  them. As usual, the sense of neglect and injury over which he had so  long brooded with little or no real cause (considering, of course, his  position, and that the world can only see our coats and not our hearts),  under these entirely accidental circumstances rose up again within him,  and blinded him to the actual state of things.    His seat, the lowest, and the nearest to the servitors, was in itself a  mark of the low estimation in which he was held. The Lord Durand had  been placed next to Aurora, as a direct encouragement to him, and a  direct hint to himself not to presume. Doubtless, Durand had been at the  castle many times, not improbably already been accepted by the Baron,  and not altogether refused by Aurora. As a fact, though delighted with  her beauty and conversation, Durand's presence was entirely due to the  will of his father, the Earl, who wished to maintain friendly relations  with Baron Thyma, and even then he would not have come had not the  lovely weather invited him to ride into the forest.    It was, however, so far true, that though his presence was accidental,  yet he was fast becoming fascinated by one who, girl though she was, was  stronger in mind than he. Now Aurora, knowing that he father's eye was  on her, dared not look towards Felix, lest by an open and pronounced  conduct she should be the cause of his being informed that his presence  was not desirable. She knew that the Baron only needed a pretext to  interfere, and was anxious to avoid offering him a chance.    Felix, seeing her glance bent downwards or towards her companion, and  never all the time turned to him, not unnaturally, but too hastily,  concluded that she had been dazzled by Durand and the possibility of an  alliance with his powerful family. He was discarded, worthless, and of  no account; he had nothing but his sword; nay, he had not a sword, he  was only an archer, a footman. Angry, jealous, and burning with inward  annoyance, despising himself since all others despised him, scarce able  to remain at the table, Felix was almost beside himself, and did not  answer nor heed the remarks of the gentlemen sitting by him, who put him  down as an ill-bred churl.    For the form's sake, indeed, he put his lips to the double-handled cup  of fine ale, which continually circulated round the table, and was never  allowed to be put down; one servant had nothing else to do but to see  that its progress never stopped. But he drank nothing, and ate nothing;  he could not swallow. How visionary, how weak and feeble now seemed the  wild scheme of the canoe and his proposed voyage! Even should it  succeed, years must elapse before he could accomplish anything  substantial; while here were men who really had what he could only think  of or imagine.    The silver chain or sword-belt of Durand (the sword and the dagger were  not worn at the banquet, nor in the house, they were received by the  marshal, and deposited in his care, a precaution against quarrelling),  solid silver links passing over his shoulder, were real actual things.  All the magnificence that he could call up by the exercise of his  imagination, was but imagination; a dream no more to be seen by others  than the air itself.    The dinner went on, and the talk became more noisy. The trout, the  chicken, the thyme lamb (trapped on the hills by the shepherds), the  plover eggs, the sirloin, the pastry (the Baroness superintended the  making of it herself), all the profusion of the table, rather set him  against food than tempted him. Nor could he drink the tiny drop, as it  were, of ancient brandy, sent round to each guest at the conclusion,  precious as liquid gold, for it had been handed down from the ancients,  and when once the cask was empty it could not be re-filled.    The dessert, the strawberries, the nuts and walnuts, carefully preserved  with a little salt, and shaken in the basket from time to time that they  might not become mouldy, the apples, the honey in the comb with slices  of white bread, nothing pleased him. Nor did he drink, otherwise than  the sip demanded by courtesy, of the thin wine of Gloucester, costly as  it was, grown in the vineyard there, and shipped across the Lake, and  rendered still more expensive by risk of pirates. This was poured into  flagons of maple wood, which, like the earthenware cup of ale, were  never allowed to touch the board till the dinner was over.    Wearily the time went on; Felix glanced more and more often at the sky  seen through the casement,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13962"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 455, September 20, 1884 (#20)"],[1,"thus  exposing the blood in the lungs to the action of oxygen in its diluted  form, as it is in the air, instead of pure oxygen, the reaction would  neither be too rapid nor too dangerous. In confirmation of my views, I  have this day learned that it is the custom in India to wear a double roll  of flannel around the abdomen, as a preventive to cholera. The other  advantages resulting from the use of the flannel bandages are:    1. That they prevent the escape of heat from the body of the poor creature  who is already in a state of refrigeration.    2. By their firmly and equally grasping both flexor and extensor muscles  alike, they are steadied, and rendered much less likely to be affected  with spasmodic action or cramp.    3. By their steady _elastic_ pressure and support of about 160 pounds,  they persistently keep up and sustain the circulation of the blood, which  they had previously restored.    4. That the oxygen thus well secured to the blood will, I believe, prove  quite sufficient to neutralize the original poison, and also destroy its  effects.    5. That this much can at least be claimed for their use--that they remove  from nature a stumbling-block, which prevented her from exercising her  marvelous recuperative powers. Diluted sulphuric acid is the best medicine  to arrest the flux from the bowels, acting also as a tonic. It should be  given in five-minim doses about every half hour, with rice gruel. By  adopting this plan, the natural process is brought about, that of the  starch being converted into grape sugar. Plenty of white of egg, well  whipped up, so as to nourish the body and convey oxygen into the stomach,  which it will appropriate, should be given. Opium, in small quantities,  and other stimulants, should be given according to the necessities of the  case. May it not be well, through the medium of wet sponge over the  thorax, to apply a continuous but gentle current of galvanism, so as to  stimulate the heart's action, keep alive the respiratory movements, and  thereby assist in the maintenance of the functions of the body?           *       *       *       *       *          TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE, AND PRESSURE IN THEIR RELATIONS TO HEALTH.      At the recent meteorological conference held at the Health Exhibition, Dr.  J.W. Tripe read a paper of much interest on some relations of  meteorological phenomena to health.    In ages long past these relations excited much attention, but the  knowledge concerning them was of the vaguest kind; and indeed, even now,  no very great advance has been made, because it is only quite recently  that we have been able to compare a fairly accurate record of deaths with  observations taken at a number of reliable meteorological stations. The  more useful and searching comparison between cases of sickness, instead of  deaths, and meteorological phenomena has yet to be accomplished on a large  scale in this country, and especially as regards zymotic diseases. In  Belgium there is a Society of Medical Practitioners, embracing nearly the  whole country, that publishes a monthly record of cases of sickness, of  deaths, and of meteorological observations; but the only attempt on a  large scale in this country, which was started by the Society of Medical  Officers of Health for the whole of London, failed partly from want of  funds, and partly from irregularity in the returns. My remarks, which must  necessarily be very brief, will refer to the relations between (1)  meteorological phenomena and the bodily functions of man, and (2) between  varying meteorological conditions and death-rates from certain diseases.    As regards the first, I will commence with a few brief remarks on the  effects of varying barometric pressures. A great deal too much attention  is paid to the barometer if we regard it as indicating only, as it really  does, variations in the weight of the column of air pressing upon our  bodies, because, except at considerable elevations, where the barometer is  always much lower than at sea level, these variations produce but little  effect on health. At considerable elevations the diminished pressure  frequently causes a great feeling of malaise, giddiness, loss of strength,  palpitation, and even nausea; and at greater heights, as was noticed by  Mr. Glaisher in a very lofty balloon ascent, loss of sight, feeling, and  consciousness. These were caused by a want of a sufficient supply of  oxygen to remove effete matters from the system, and to carry on the  organic functions necessary for the maintenance of life. On elevated  mountain plateaus, or even in high residences among the Alps, an increased  rapidity in the number of respirations and of the pulse, as well as  increased evaporation from the lungs and skin, occur.    For some years past, many persons suffering from consumption, gout,  rheumatism, and anaemic affections have gone to mountain stations, chiefly  in Switzerland, for relief, and many have derived much benefit from the  change. It must not, however, be supposed that diminished atmospheric  pressure was the chief cause of the improvement in health, as its  concomitants, viz., a diminution in the quantity of oxygen and moisture  contained in each cubic foot of air, probably the low temperature, with a  total change in the daily habits of life, have assisted in the beneficial  results. The diminution in the quantity of air, and consequently of  oxygen, taken in at each breath is to a certain extent counterbalanced by  an increased frequency and depth of the respirations, and a greater  capacity of the chest. In this country, alterations in the barometric  pressure are chiefly valuable as indicating an approaching change in the  wind, and as well as of the amount of moisture in the air; hence the  instrument is often called \"the weather glass.\" A sudden diminution in the  atmospheric pressure is likely to be attended with an escape of ground air  from the soil, and therefore to cause injury to health, especially among  the occupants of basement rooms, unless the whole interior of the building  be covered with concrete.    _Temperature._--Experience has shown that man can bear greater variations  of temperature than any other animal, as in the Arctic regions a  temperature of -70 degrees Fahrenheit, or more than 100 degrees below  freezing point, can be safely borne; that he can not only live but work,  and remain in good health, in these regions provided that he be supplied  with suitable clothing and plenty of proper food. On the other hand, man  has existed and taken exercise in the interior of Australia when the  thermometer showed a temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit, or nearly 90  degrees above freezing point, so that he can live and be in fairly good  health within a range of nearly 200 degrees Fahrenheit.    The effects of a high temperature vary very much according to the amount  of moisture in the air, as when the air is nearly saturated in hot  climates, or even in summer in our own, more or less languor and malaise  are felt, with great indisposition to bodily labor. With a dry air these  are not so noticeable. The cause is evident; in the former case but little  evaporation occurs from the skin, and the normal amount of moisture is not  given off from the lungs, so that the body is not cooled down to such an  extent as by dry air. Sunstroke is probably the result, not only of the  direct action of the sun's rays, but partly from diminished cooling of the  blood by want of evaporation from the lungs and skin.    The effects of temperature on man do not depend so much on the mean for  the day, month, or year, as on the extremes, as, when the days are hot and  the nights comparatively cool, the energy of the system becomes partially  restored, so that a residence near the sea, or in the vicinity of high  mountains, in hot climates is, other things being equal, less enervating  than in the plains, as the night air is generally cooler. It is commonly  believed that hot climates are _necessarily_ injurious to Europeans, by  causing frequent liver derangements and diseases, dysentery, cholera, and  fevers. This, however, is, to a certain extent, a mistake, as the recent  medical statistical returns of our army in India show that in the new  barracks, with more careful supervision as regards diet and clothing, the  sickness and death-rates are much reduced. Planters and others, who ride  about a good deal, as a rule keep in fairly good health; but the children  of Europeans certainly degenerate, and after two or three generations die  out, unless they intermarry with natives, and make frequent visits to  colder climates. This fact shows that hot climates, probably by  interfering with the due performance of the various processes concerned in  the formation and destruction of the bodily tissues, eventually sap the  foundations of life among Europeans; but how far this result has been  caused by bad habits as regards food, exercise, and self-indulgence, I  cannot say. Rapid changes of temperature in this country are often very  injurious to the young and old, causing diarrhoea and derangements of the  liver when great heat occurs, and inflammatory diseases of the lungs,  colds, etc., when the air becomes suddenly colder, even in summer.    The _direct_ influence of rain on man is not very marked in this country,  except by giving moisture to the air by evaporation from the ground and  from vegetable life, and by altering the level of ground water. This is a  subject almost overlooked by the public, and it is therefore as well that  it should be known that when ground water has a level persistently less  than five feet from the surface of the soil, the locality is usually  unhealthy, and should not, if possible, be selected for a residence.  Fluctuations in the level of ground water, especially if great and sudden,  generally cause ill-health among the residents. Thus, Dr. Buchanan in his  reports to the Privy Council"]]]
