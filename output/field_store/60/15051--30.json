The custom-house was a desired prize, and when my brother  interpreted their desires to the collector, he consented to open  the safe, as life had charms for him, even in Arizona. Uncle Sam's  strong-box yielded up over a thousand dobes. They turned their  attention to the few small stores of the town, looting them of the  money and goods as they went. There was quite a large store kept by a  Frenchman, who refused to open, when he realized that the Timochi was  honoring the town with his presence. They put the boy in the front  and ordered him to call on the Frenchman to open up. He said afterward  that he put in a word for himself, telling him not to do any shooting  through the door. After some persuasion the store was opened and  proved to be quite a prize. Then they turned their attention to the  store where the boy worked. He unlocked it and waved them in. He went  into the cellar and brought up half a dozen bottles of imported French  Cognac, and invited the chief bandit and his followers to be good  enough to join him. In the mean time they had piled up on the counters  such things as they wanted. They made no money demand on him, the  chief asking him to set a price on the things they were taking. He  made a hasty inventory of the goods and gave the chief the figures,  about one hundred and ten dollars. The chief opened a sack that they  had taken from the custom-house and paid the bill with a flourish.    \"The chief then said that he had a favor to ask: that my brother  should cheer for the revolutionists, to identify him as a friend. That  was easy, so he mounted the counter and gave three cheers of 'Viva los  Timochis!' He got down off the counter, took the bandit by the arm,  and led him to the rear, where with glasses in the air they drank to  'Viva los Timochis!' again. Then the chief and his men withdrew and  recrossed the river. It was the best day's trade he had had in a long  time. Now, here comes in the native. While the boy did everything  from compulsion and policy, the native element looked upon him with  suspicion. The owners of the store, knowing that this suspicion  existed, advised him to leave, and he did.\"    The two prisoners were sleeping soundly. Sleep comes easily to tired  men, and soon all but the solitary guard were wrapped in sleep, to  fight anew in rangers' dreams scathless battles!           *       *       *       *       *    There was not lacking the pathetic shade in the redemption of this  State from crime and lawlessness. In the village burying-ground of  Round Rock, Texas, is a simple headstone devoid of any lettering save  the name \"Sam Bass.\" His long career of crime and lawlessness would  fill a good-sized volume. He met his death at the hands of Texas  Rangers. Years afterward a woman, with all the delicacy of her sex,  and knowing the odium that was attached to his career, came to this  town from her home in the North and sought out his grave. As only a  woman can, when some strong tie of affection binds, this woman went to  work to mark the last resting-place of the wayward man. Concealing her  own identity, she performed these sacred rites, clothing in mystery  her relation to the criminal. The people of the village would not have  withheld their services in well-meant friendship, but she shrank from  them, being a stranger.    A year passed, and she came again. This time she brought the stone  which marks his last resting-place. The chivalry of this generous  people was aroused in admiration of a woman that would defy the  calumny attached to an outlaw. While she would have shrunk from  kindness, had she been permitted, such devotion could not go  unchallenged. So she disclosed her identity.    She was his sister.    Bass was Northern born, and this sister was the wife of a respectable  practicing physician in Indiana. Womanlike, her love for a wayward  brother followed him beyond his disgraceful end. With her own hands  she performed an act that has few equals, as a testimony of love and  affection for her own.    For many years afterward she came annually, her timidity having worn  away after the generous reception accorded her at the hands of a  hospitable people.          VIII    AT COMANCHE FORD      \"There's our ford,\" said Juan,--our half-blood trailer,--pointing to  the slightest sag in a low range of hills distant twenty miles.    We were Texas Rangers. It was nearly noon of a spring day, and we  had halted on sighting our destination,--Comanche Ford on the Concho  River. Less than three days before, we had been lounging around camp,  near Tepee City, one hundred and seventy-five miles northeast of our  present destination. A courier had reached us with an emergency order,  which put every man in the saddle within an hour after its receipt.    An outfit with eight hundred cattle had started west up the Concho.  Their destination was believed to be New Mexico. Suspicion rested on  them, as they had failed to take out inspection papers for moving the  cattle, and what few people had seen them declared that one half the  cattle were brand burnt or blotched beyond recognition. Besides, they  had an outfit of twenty heavily armed men, or twice as many as were  required to manage a herd of that size.    Our instructions were to make this crossing with all possible haste,  and if our numbers were too few, there to await assistance before  dropping down the river to meet the herd. When these courier orders  reached us at Tepee, they found only twelve men in camp, with not an  officer above a corporal. Fortunately we had Dad Root with us, a man  whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been  our captain. He had not the advantage in years that his name would  indicate, but he was an exceedingly useful man in the service. He  could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree  from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy. In dressing  a gun-shot wound, he had the delicate touch of a woman. Every man  in the company went to him with his petty troubles, and came away  delighted. Therefore there was no question as to who should be our  leader on this raid; no one but Dad was even considered.    Sending a brief note to the adjutant-general by this same courier,  stating that we had started with twelve men, we broke camp, and in  less than an hour were riding southwest. One thing which played into  our hands in making this forced ride was the fact that we had a number  of extra horses on hand. For a few months previous we had captured  quite a number of stolen horses, and having no chance to send into the  settlements where they belonged, we used them as extra riding horses.  With our pack mules light and these extra saddlers for a change, we  covered the country rapidly. Sixteen hours a day in the saddle makes  camp-fires far apart. Dad, too, could always imagine that a few miles  farther on we would find a fine camping spot, and his views were law  to us.    We had been riding hard for an hour across a tableland known as  Cibollo Mesa, and now for the first time had halted at sighting our  destination, yet distant three hours' hard riding. \"Boys,\" said Dad,  \"we'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big  pool in the river. After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as  fresh as pond-lilies.\"    \"Oh, we swim this evening, do we?\" inquired Orchard. \"That's a  Christian idea, Dad, cleanliness, you know. Do we look as though a  swim would improve our good looks?\" The fact that, after a ride like  the one we were near finishing, every man of us was saturated with  fine alkaline dust, made the latter question ludicrous.    For this final ride we changed horses for the last time on the trip,  and after a three hours' ride under a mid-day torrid sun, the shade of  Concho's timber and the companionship of running water were ours.  We rode with a whoop into the camp which Dad had had in his mind all  morning, and found it a paradise. We fell out of our saddles, and  tired horses were rolling and groaning all around us in a few minutes.  The packs were unlashed with the same alacrity, while horses, mules,  and men hurried to the water. With the exception of two horses on  picket, it was a loose camp in a few moments' time. There was no  thought of eating now, with such inviting swimming pools as the spring  freshets had made.    Dad soon located the big pool, for he had been there before, and  shortly a dozen men floundered and thrashed around in it like a school  of dolphins. On one side of the pool was a large sloping rock, from  which splendid diving could be had. On this rock we gathered like kid  goats on a stump, or sunned ourselves like lizards. To get the benefit  of the deepest water, only one could dive at a time. We were so  bronzed from the sun that when undressed the protected parts afforded  a striking contrast to the brown bands about our necks. Orchard was  sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive, when Long John,  patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly,--    \"Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my  picture taken kind of half careless like--like the girls do sometimes.  Wear one of those far-away looks, roll up your eyes, and throw up  your head like you was listening for it to thunder. Then while in that  attitude, act as if you didn't notice and let all your clothing fall  entirely off your shoulder. If you'll have your picture taken that way  and give me one, I'll promise you to set a heap of store by it, old  man.\"    Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the  water, and ventured, \"Wouldn't I need a shave? and oughtn't I to have  a string of beads around my swan-like neck, with a few spangles on it  to glitter and sparkle? I'd have to hold my right hand over this  old gun scar in my left shoulder, so as not to mar the beauty of the  picture."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#20)"],[1," he would belieue Mr. Bishop or Leiftenat  Bell or herself.    \"The testor is ready to giue oath to sd testimony.
