He would not permit them to hold religious  meetings or any other kinds of meetings, but they frequently met in  secret to conduct religious services. When they were caught, the  \"instigators\"--known or suspected--were severely flogged. Charlotte  recalls how her oldest brother was whipped to death for taking part in  one of the religious ceremonies. This cruel act halted the secret  religious services.    Wilkerson found it very profitable to raise and sell slaves. He  selected the strongest and best male and female slaves and mated them  exclusively for breeding. The huskiest babies were given the best of  attention in order that they might grow into sturdy youths, for it was  those who brought the highest prices at the slave markets. Sometimes the  master himself had sexual relations with his female slaves, for the  products of miscegenation were very remunerative. These offsprings were  in demand as house servants.    After slavery the Mitchells began to separate. A few of the children  remained with their parents and eked out their living from the soil.  During this period Charlotte began to attract attention with her herb  cures. Doctors sought her out when they were stumped by difficult cases.  She came to Live Oak to care for an old colored woman and upon whose  death she was given the woman's house and property. For many years she  has resided in the old shack, farming, making quilts, and practicing her  herb doctoring. She has outlived her husband for whom she bore two  children. Her daughter is feebleminded--her herb remedies can't cure  her!      Sarah Ross    Born in Benton County, Mississippi nearly eighty years ago, Sarah is the  daughter of Harriet Elmore and William Donaldson, her white owner.  Donaldson was a very cruel man and frequently beat Sarah's mother  because she would not have sexual relations with the overseer, a colored  man by the name of Randall. Sarah relates that the slaves did not marry,  but were forced--in many cases against their will--to live together as  man and wife. It was not until after slavery that they learned about the  holy bonds of matrimony, and many of them actually married.    Cotton, corn, and rice were the chief products grown on the Donaldson  plantation. Okra also was grown, and from this product coffee was made.  The slaves arose with the sun to begin their tasks in the fields and  worked until dusk. They were beaten by the overseer if they dared to  rest themselves. No kind of punishment was too cruel or severe to be  inflicted upon these souls in bondage. Frequently the thighs of the male  slaves were gashed with a saw and salt put in the wound as a means of  punishment for some misdemeanor. The female slaves often had their hair  cut off, especially those who had long beautiful hair. If a female slave  was pregnant and had to be punished, she was whipped about the  shoulders, not so much in pity as for the protection of the unborn  child. Donaldson's wife committed suicide because of the cruelty not  only to the slaves but to her as well.    The slaves were not permitted to hold any sort of meeting, not even to  worship God. Their work consumed so much of their time that they had  little opportunity to congregate. They had to wash their clothes on  Sunday, the only day which they could call their own. On Sunday  afternoon some of the slaves were sent for to entertain the family and  its guests.    Sarah remembers the coming of the Yankees and the destruction wrought by  their appearance. The soldiers stripped the plantation owners of their  meats, vegetables, poultry and the like. Many plantation owners took  their own lives in desperation. Donaldson kept his slaves several months  after liberation and defied them to mention freedom to him. When he did  give them freedom, they lost no time in leaving his plantation which  held for them only unpleasant memories. Sarah came to Florida  thirty-five years ago. She has been married twice, and is the mother of  ten children, eight of whom are living.      REFERENCES    1.

The mother was the mulatto offspring of  William Lowe and a slave woman who was half Cherokee. The father was  also a mulatto, purchased from a nearby plantation.    Because of this blood mixture Rebecca's parents were known as \"house  niggers,\" and lived on quarters located in the rear of the \"big house.\"  A \"house nigger\" was a servant whose duties consisted of chores around  the big house, such as butler, maid, cook, stableman, gardner and  personal attendant to the man who owned him.    These slaves were often held in high esteem by their masters and of  course fared much better than the other slaves on the plantation. Quite  often they were mulattoes as in the case of Rebecca's parents. There  seemed to be a general belief among slave owners that mulattoes could  not stand as much laborious work as pure blooded Negro slaves. This  accounts probably for the fact that the majority of ex-slaves now alive  are mulattoes.    The Lowes were originally of Virginia and did not own as much property  in Georgia as they had in Virginia. Rebecca estimates the number of  slaves on this plantation as numbering no more than 25.    They were treated kindly and cruelly by turns, according to the whims of  a master and mistress who were none too stable in their dispositions.  There was no \"driver\" or overseer on this plantation, as \"Old Tom was  devil enough himself when he wanted to be,\" observes Rebecca. While she  never felt the full force of his cruelties, she often felt sorry for the  other slaves who were given a task too heavy to be completed in the  given time; this deliberately, so that the master might have some excuse  to vent his pentup feelings. Punishment was always in the form of a  severe whipping or revocation of a slave's privilege, such as visiting  other plantations etc.    The Lowes were not wealthy and it was necessary for them to raise and  manufacture as many things on the plantation as possible. Slaves toiled  from early morning until night in the corn, cotton sugar cane and  tobacco fields. Others tended the large herds of cattle from which milk,  butter, meat and leather was produced. The leather was tanned and made  into crude shoes for the slaves for the short winter months. No one wore  shoes except during cold weather and on Sundays. Fruit orchards and  vegetables were also grown, but not given as much attention as the  cotton and corn, as these were the main money crops.    As a child Rebecca learned to ape the ways of her mistress. At first  this was considered very amusing. Whenever she had not knitted her  required number of socks during the week, she simply informed them that  she had not done it because she had not wanted to--besides she was not a  \"nigger.\" This stubbornness accompanied by hysterical tantrums continued  to cause Rebecca to receive many stiff punishments that might have been  avoided. Her master had given orders that no one was ever to whip her,  so devious methods were employed to punish her, such as marching her  down the road with hands tied behind her back, or locking her in a dark  room for several hours with only bread and water.    Rebecca resembled very much a daughter of William Lowe. The girl was  really her aunt, and very conscious of the resemblance. Both had brown  eyes and long dark hair. They were about the same height and the clothes  of the young mistress fitted Rebecca \"like a glove.\" To offset this  likeness, Rebecca's hair was always cut very short. Finally Rebecca  rebelled at having her hair all cut off and blankly refused to submit to  the treatment any longer. After this happening, the girls formed a  dislike for each other, and Rebecca was guilty of doing every mean act  of which she was capable to torment the white girl. Rebecca's mother  aided and abetted her in this, often telling her things to do. Rebecca  did not fear the form of punishment administered her and she had the  cunning to keep \"on the good side of the master\" who had a fondness for  her \"because she was so much like the Lowes.\" The mistress' demand that  she be sold or beaten was always turned aside with \"Dear, you know the  child can't help it; its that cursed Cherokee blood in her.\"    There seemed to be no very strong opposition to a slave's learning to  read and write on the plantation, so Rebecca learned along with the  white children. Her father purchased books for her with money he was  allowed to earn from the sale of corn whiskey which he made, or from  work done on some other plantation during his time off. He was not  permitted to buy his freedom, however.    On Sundays Rebecca attended church along with the other slaves. Services  were held in the white churches after their services were over. They  were taught to obey their masters and work hard, and that they should be  very thankful for the institution of slavery which brought them from  darkest Africa.    On the plantation, the doctor was not nearly as popular as the \"granny\"  or midwife, who brewed medicines for every ailment. Each plantation had  its own \"granny\" who also served the mistress during confinement.

In compression tests on very dry specimens  the entire piece splits suddenly into pieces before any buckling  takes place (see Fig. 9.), while with wet material the block  gives way gradually, due to the buckling or bending of the walls  of the fibres along one or more shearing planes. (See Fig. 14.)  In bending tests on wet beams, first failure occurs by  compression on top of the beam, gradually extending downward  toward the neutral axis. Finally the beam ruptures at the  bottom. In the case of very dry beams the failure is usually by  splitting or tension on the under side (see Fig. 17.), without  compression on the upper, and is often sudden and without  warning, and even while the load is still increasing. The effect  varies somewhat with different species, chestnut, for example,  becoming more brittle upon drying than do ash, hemlock, and  longleaf pine. The tensile strength of wood is least affected by  drying, as a rule.    In drying wood no increase in strength results until the free  water is evaporated and the cell walls begin to dry[49]. This  critical point has been called the _fibre-saturation point_.  (See Fig. 24.) Conversely, after the cell walls are saturated  with water, any increase in the amount of water absorbed merely  fills the cavities and intercellular spaces, and has no effect  on the mechanical properties. Hence, soaking green wood does not  lessen its strength unless the water is heated, whereupon a  decided weakening results.    [Footnote 49: The wood of _Eucalyptus globulus_ (blue gum)  appears to be an exception to this rule. Tiemann says: \"The wood  of blue gum begins to shrink immediately from the green  condition, even at 70 to 90 per cent moisture content, instead  of from 30 or 25 per cent as in other species of hardwoods.\"  Proc. Soc. Am. For., Washington, Vol. VIII, No. 3, Oct., 1913,  p. 313.]    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Relation of the moisture content to the  various strength values of spruce. FSP = fibre-saturation  point.]    The strengthening effects of drying, while very marked in the  case of small pieces, may be fully offset in structural timbers  by inherent weakening effects due to the splitting apart of the  wood elements as a result of irregular shrinkage, and in some  cases also to the slitting of the cell walls (see Fig. 25).  Consequently with large timbers in commercial use it is unsafe  to count upon any greater strength, even after seasoning, than  that of the green or fresh condition.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Cross section of the wood of western  larch showing fissures in the thick-walled cells of the late  wood. Highly magnified. _Photo by U. S. Forest Service._]    In green wood the cells are all intimately joined together and  are at their natural or normal size when saturated with water.  The cell walls may be considered as made up of little particles  with water between them. When wood is dried the films of water  between the particles become thinner and thinner until almost  entirely gone. As a result the cell walls grow thinner with loss  of moisture,--in other words, the cell shrinks.    It is at once evident that if drying does not take place  uniformly throughout an entire piece of timber, the shrinkage as  a whole cannot be uniform. The process of drying is from the  outside inward, and if the loss of moisture at the surface is  met by a steady capillary current of water from the inside, the  shrinkage, so far as the degree of moisture affected it, would  be uniform. In the best type of dry kilns this condition is  approximated by first heating the wood thoroughly in a moist  atmosphere before allowing drying to begin.    In air-seasoning and in ordinary dry kilns this condition too  often is not attained, and the result is that a dry shell is  formed which encloses a moist interior. (See Fig. 26.)  Subsequent drying out of the inner portion is rendered more  difficult by this \"case-hardened\" condition. As the outer part  dries it is prevented from shrinking by the wet interior, which  is still at its greatest volume. This outer portion must either  check open or the fibres become strained in tension. If this  outer shell dries while the fibres are thus strained they become  \"set\" in this condition, and are no longer in tension. Later  when the inner part dries, it tends to shrink away from the  hardened outer shell, so that the inner fibres are now strained  in tension and the outer fibres are in compression. If the  stress exceeds the cohesion, numerous cracks open up, producing  a \"honey-combed\" condition, or \"hollow-horning,\" as it is  called. If such a case-hardened stick of wood be resawed, the  two halves will cup from the internal tension and external  compression, with the concave surface inward.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Progress of drying throughout the  length of a chestnut beam, the black spots indicating the  presence of free water in the wood. The first section at the  left was cut one-fourth inch from the end, the next one-half  inch, the next one inch, and all the others one inch apart. The  illustration shows case-hardening very clearly. _Photo by U. S.  Forest Service._]    For a given surface area the loss of water from wood is always  greater from the ends than from the sides, due to the fact that  the vessels and other water-carriers are cut across, allowing  ready entrance of drying air and outlet for the water vapor.  Water does not flow out of boards and timbers of its own accord,  but must be evaporated, though it may be forced out of very  sappy specimens by heat. In drying a log or pole with the bark  on, most of the water must be evaporated through the ends, but  in the case of peeled timbers and sawn boards the loss is  greatest from the surface because the area exposed is so much  greater.    The more rapid drying of the ends causes local shrinkage, and  were the material sufficiently plastic the ends would become  bluntly tapering. The rigidity of the wood substance prevents  this and the fibres are split apart. Later, as the remainder of  the stick dries many of the checks will come together, though  some of the largest will remain and even increase in size as the  drying proceeds. (See Fig. 27.)    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Excessive season checking. _Photo by U.  S. Forest Service._]    A wood cell shrinks very little lengthwise. A dry wood cell is,  therefore, practically of the same length as it was in a green  or saturated condition, but is smaller in cross section, has  thinner walls, and a larger cavity. It is at once evident that  this fact makes shrinkage more irregular, for wherever cells  cross each other at a decided angle they will tend to pull apart  upon drying. This occurs wherever pith rays and wood fibres  meet. A considerable portion of every wood is made up of these  rays, which for the most part have their cells lying in a radial  direction instead of longitudinally. (See Frontispiece.) In  pine, over 15,000 of these occur on a square inch of a  tangential section, and even in oak the very large rays which  are readily visible to the eye as flakes on quarter-sawed  material represent scarcely one per cent of the number which the  microscope reveals.    A pith ray shrinks in height and width, that is, vertically and  tangentially as applied to the position in a standing tree, but  very little in length or radially. The other elements of the  wood shrink radially and tangentially, but almost none  lengthwise or vertically as applied to the tree. Here, then, we  find the shrinkage of the rays tending to shorten a stick of  wood, while the other cells resist it, and the tendency of a  stick to get smaller in circumference is resisted by the endwise  reaction or thrust of the rays. Only in a tangential direction,  or around the stick in direction of the annual rings of growth,  do the two forces coincide. Another factor to the same end is  that the denser bands of late wood are continuous in a  tangential direction, while radially they are separated by  alternate zones of less dense early wood. Consequently the  shrinkage along the rings (tangential) is fully twice as much as  toward the centre (radial). (See Table XIV.) This explains why  some cracks open more and more as drying advances. (See Fig.  27.)    Although actual shrinkage in length is small, nevertheless the  tendency of the rays to shorten a stick produces strains which  are responsible for some of the splitting open of ties, posts,  and sawed timbers with box heart.
