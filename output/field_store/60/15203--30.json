'But, hark ye, Stratonice,' said Lydon; 'how didst thou come by so  gentle and delicate a slave?  She were more meet for the handmaid of  some rich matron of Rome than for thee.'    'That is true,' returned Stratonice; 'and some day or other I shall make  my fortune by selling her.  How came I by Nydia, thou askest.'    'Ay!'    'Why, thou seest, my slave Staphyla--thou rememberest Staphyla, Niger?'    'Ay, a large-handed wench, with a face like a comic mask.  How should I  forget her, by Pluto, whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment!'    'Tush, brute!--Well, Staphyla died one day, and a great loss she was to  me, and I went into the market to buy me another slave.  But, by the  gods! they were all grown so dear since I had bought poor Staphyla, and  money was so scarce, that I was about to leave the place in despair,  when a merchant plucked me by the robe.  \"Mistress,\" said he, \"dost thou  want a slave cheap I have a child to sell--a bargain. She is but little,  and almost an infant, it is true; but she is quick and quiet, docile and  clever, sings well, and is of good blood, I assure you.\" \"Of what  country?\" said I.  \"Thessalian.\" Now I knew the Thessalians were acute  and gentle; so I said I would see the girl.  I found her just as you see  her now, scarcely smaller and scarcely younger in appearance.  She  looked patient and resigned enough, with her hands crossed on her bosom,  and her eyes downcast. I asked the merchant his price: it was moderate,  and I bought her at once.  The merchant brought her to my house, and  disappeared in an instant.  Well, my friends, guess my astonishment when  I found she was blind!  Ha! ha! a clever fellow that merchant!  I ran at  once to the magistrates, but the rogue was already gone from Pompeii. So  I was forced to go home in a very ill humor, I assure you; and the poor  girl felt the effects of it too.  But it was not her fault that she was  blind, for she had been so from her birth.  By degrees, we got  reconciled to our purchase.  True, she had not the strength of Staphyla,  and was of very little use in the house, but she could soon find her way  about the town, as well as if she had the eyes of Argus; and when one  morning she brought us home a handful of sesterces, which she said she  had got from selling some flowers she had gathered in our poor little  garden, we thought the gods had sent her to us.  So from that time we  let her go out as she likes, filling her basket with flowers, which she  wreathes into garlands after the Thessalian fashion, which pleases the  gallants; and the great people seem to take a fancy to her, for they  always pay her more than they do any other flower-girl, and she brings  all of it home to us, which is more than any other slave would do.  So I  work for myself, but I shall soon afford from her earnings to buy me a  second Staphyla; doubtless, the Thessalian kidnapper had stolen the  blind girl from gentle parents.  Besides her skill in the garlands, she  sings and plays on the cithara, which also brings money, and lately--but  that is a secret.'    'That is a secret! What!' cried Lydon, 'art thou turned sphinx?'    'Sphinx, no!--why sphinx?'    'Cease thy gabble, good mistress, and bring us our meat--I am hungry,'  said Sporus, impatiently.    'And I, too,' echoed the grim Niger, whetting his knife on the palm of  his hand.    The amazon stalked away to the kitchen, and soon returned with a tray  laden with large pieces of meat half-raw: for so, as now, did the heroes  of the prize-fight imagine they best sustained their hardihood and  ferocity: they drew round the table with the eyes of famished  wolves--the meat vanished, the wine flowed.  So leave we those important  personages of classic life to follow the steps of Burbo.        Chapter II    TWO WORTHIES.    IN the earlier times of Rome the priesthood was a profession, not of  lucre but of honour.  It was embraced by the noblest citizens--it was  forbidden to the plebeians.  Afterwards, and long previous to the  present date, it was equally open to all ranks; at least, that part of  the profession which embraced the flamens, or priests--not of religion  generally but of peculiar gods.  Even the priest of Jupiter (the Flamen  Dialis) preceded by a lictor, and entitled by his office to the entrance  of the senate, at first the especial dignitary of the patricians, was  subsequently the choice of the people.  The less national and less  honored deities were usually served by plebeian ministers; and many  embraced the profession, as now the Roman Catholic Christians enter the  monastic fraternity, less from the impulse of devotion than the  suggestions of a calculating poverty.  Thus Calenus, the priest of Isis,  was of the lowest origin.  His relations, though not his parents, were  freedmen.  He had received from them a liberal education, and from his  father a small patrimony, which he had soon exhausted.  He embraced the  priesthood as a last resource from distress.  Whatever the state  emoluments of the sacred profession, which at that time were probably  small, the officers of a popular temple could never complain of the  profits of their calling.  There is no profession so lucrative as that  which practises on the superstition of the multitude.    Calenus had but one surviving relative at Pompeii, and that was Burbo.  Various dark and disreputable ties, stronger than those of blood, united  together their hearts and interests; and often the minister of Isis  stole disguised and furtively from the supposed austerity of his  devotions; and gliding through the back door of the retired gladiator, a  man infamous alike by vices and by profession, rejoiced to throw off the  last rag of an hypocrisy which, but for the dictates of avarice, his  ruling passion, would at all time have sat clumsily upon a nature too  brutal for even the mimicry of virtue.    Wrapped in one of those large mantles which came in use among the Romans  in proportion as they dismissed the toga, whose ample folds well  concealed the form, and in which a sort of hood (attached to it)  afforded no less a security to the features, Calenus now sat in the  small and private chamber of the wine-cellar, whence a small passage ran  at once to that back entrance, with which nearly all the houses of  Pompeii were furnished.    Opposite to him sat the sturdy Burbo, carefully counting on a table  between them a little pile of coins which the priest had just poured  from his purse--for purses were as common then as now, with this  difference--they were usually better furnished!    'You see,' said Calenus, 'that we pay you handsomely, and you ought to  thank me for recommending you to so advantageous a market.'    'I do, my cousin, I do,' replied Burbo, affectionately, as he swept the  coins into a leathern receptacle, which he then deposited in his girdle,  drawing the buckle round his capacious waist more closely than he was  wont to do in the lax hours of his domestic avocations.  'And by Isis,  Pisis, and Nisis, or whatever other gods there may be in Egypt, my  little Nydia is a very Hesperides--a garden of gold to me.'    'She sings well, and plays like a muse,' returned Calenus; 'those are  virtues that he who employs me always pays liberally.'    'He is a god,' cried Burbo, enthusiastically; 'every rich man who is  generous deserves to be worshipped.  But come, a cup of wine, old  friend: tell me more about it.  What does she do? she is frightened,  talks of her oath, and reveals nothing.'    'Nor will I, by my right hand!  I, too, have taken that terrible oath of  secrecy.'    'Oath! what are oaths to men like us?'    'True oaths of a common fashion; but this!'--and the stalwart priest  shuddered as he spoke.  'Yet,' he continued, in emptying a huge cup of  unmixed wine, 'I own to thee, that it is not so much the oath that I  dread as the vengeance of him who proposed it.  By the gods! he is a  mighty sorcerer, and could draw my confession from the moon, did I dare  to make it to her.  Talk no more of this.  By Pollux! wild as those  banquets are which I enjoy with him, I am never quite at my ease there.  I love, my boy, one jolly hour with thee, and one of the plain,  unsophisticated, laughing girls that I meet in this chamber, all  smoke-dried though it be, better than whole nights of those magnificent  debauches.'    'Ho! sayest thou so!  To-morrow night, please the gods, we will have  then a snug carousal.'    'With all my heart,' said the priest, rubbing his hands, and drawing  himself nearer to the table.    At this moment they heard a slight noise at the door, as of one feeling  the handle.  The priest lowered the hood over his head.    'Tush!' whispered the host, 'it is but the blind girl,' as Nydia opened  the door, and entered the apartment.    'Ho! girl, and how durst thou? thou lookest pale--thou hast kept late  revels?  No matter, the young must be always the young,' said Burbo,  encouragingly.    The girl made no answer, but she dropped on one of the seats with an air  of lassitude.  Her color went and came rapidly: she beat the floor  impatiently with her small feet, then she suddenly raised her face, and  said with a determined voice:    'Master, you may starve me if you will--you may beat me--you may  threaten me with death--but I will go no more to that unholy place!'    'How, fool!' said Burbo, in a savage voice, and his heavy brows met  darkly over his fierce and bloodshot eyes; 'how, rebellious! Take care.'    'I have said it,' said the poor girl, crossing her hands on her breast.    'What! my modest one, sweet vestal, thou wilt go no more!  Very well,  thou shalt be carried.'    'I will raise the city with my cries,' said she, passionately; and the  color mounted to her brow.    'We will take care of that too; thou shalt go gagged.'    'Then may the gods help me!' said Nydia, rising; 'I will appeal to the  magistrates.'    'Thine oath remember!'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15663"],[0,"Ancient Egypt (#20)"],[1,"ordinary spring rains,  drought and famine set in on the Palestinian uplands, there was in  ancient times but one resource. Egypt was known as a land of plenty.  Whether it were Hebrew nomads, or Hittite warriors, or Phoenician traders  that suffered, Egypt was the sole refuge, the sole hope. There the river  gave the plenteous sustenance which would be elsewhere sought in vain.  There were granaries and storehouses, and an old established system  whereby corn was laid up as a reserve in case of need, both by private  individuals of the wealthier classes and by the kings. There among the  highest officers of state was the \"steward of the public granary.\" whose  business it was, when famine pressed, to provide, so far as was  possible, both for natives and foreigners, alleviating the distress of  all, while safeguarding, of course, the king's interests (Gen. xlvii.  13-26).    Abraham, therefore, when he found that \"the famine was grievous in the  land\" of Canaan, did the only thing that it was possible for him to  do--left Palestine, and wended his way through the desert to the  Egyptian frontier. What company he took with him is uncertain. A few  years later we find him at the head of a body of three hundred and  eighteen men capable of bearing arms--\"trained servants born in his  house\"--which implies the headship over a tribe of at least twelve  hundred persons. He can scarcely have entered Egypt with a much smaller  number. It was before his separation from his nephew, Lot, whose  followers were not much fewer than his own. And to leave any of his  dependents behind would have been to leave them to starvation. We must  suppose a numerous caravan organized, with asses and camels to carry  provisions and household stuff, and with the women and the little ones  conveyed as we see them in the sculpture representing the arrival of  Abusha from the same quarter, albeit with a smaller _entourage._ The  desert journey would be trying, and probably entail much loss,  especially of the cattle and beasts; but at length, on the seventh or  eighth day, as the water was getting low in the skins and the camels  were beginning to faint and groan with the scant fare and the long  travel, a dark low line would appear upon the edge of the horizon in  front, and soon the line would deepen into a delicate fringe, sparkling  here and there as though it were sown with diamonds.[13] Then it would  be recognized that there lay before the travellers the fields and  gardens and palaces and obelisks of Egypt, the broad flood and rich  plain of the Nile, and their hearts would leap with joy, and lift  themselves up in thanksgiving to the Most High, who had brought them  through the great and terrible wilderness to a land of plenty.    But now a fresh anxiety fell upon the spirit of the chief. Tradition  tells us that already in Babylonia he had had experience of the violence  and tyranny of earthly potentates, and had with difficulty escaped from  an attempt which the king of Babylon made upon his life. Either memory  recalled this and similar dangers, or reason suggested what the  unbridled licence of irresponsible power might conceive and execute  under the circumstances. The Pharaohs had, it is plain, already departed  from the simple manners of the earlier times, when each prince was  contented with a single wife, and had substituted for the primitive law  of monogamy that corrupt system of hareem life which has kept its ground  in the East from an ancient date to the present day. Abraham was aware  of this, and \"as he was come near to enter into Egypt,\" but was not yet  entered, he was seized with a great fear. \"Behold,\" he said to Sarai his  wife, \"Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon;  therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that  they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will  save thee alive,\" Under these circumstances Abraham, with a craft not  unnatural in an Oriental, but certainly far from commendable, resolved  to dissemble his relationship towards Sarah, and to represent her as not  his wife, but his sister. She was, in point of fact, his half-sister, as  he afterwards pleaded to Abimelech (Gen. xx. 12), being the daughter of  Terah by a secondary wife, and married to her half-brother \"Say, I pray  thee,\" he said, \"thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy  sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\" Sarah acquiesced; and no  doubt the whole tribe was made acquainted with the resolution come to,  so that they might all be in one story.    The frontier was then approached. We learn from the history of Abusha,  as well as from other scattered notices in the papyri, how carefully the  eastern border was always guarded, and what precautions were taken to  apprise the Court when any considerable body of immigrants arrived. The  chief official upon the frontier, either Khnumhotep or some one  occupying a similar position, would receive the in-comers, subject them  to interrogation, and cause his secretary to draw up a report, which  would be forwarded by courier to the capital. The royal orders would be  awaited, and meantime perhaps fresh reports would be sent by other  officials of the neighbourhood. In the present instance, we are told  that several \"princes of Pharaoh,\" having been struck with the beauty of  Sarah, commended her to their royal master, who sent for her and had her  brought into his own house. Abraham himself was well received and  treated with much distinction \"for her sake.\" According to Eupolemus, he  and his were settled in the sacred city of On or Heliopolis; and there,  in that seat of learning and religion, the Patriarch, as the same  authority declares, lived peacefully for many years and taught the  Egyptians the sciences of astronomy and arithmetic. The author of  Genesis says nothing of the place of his abode, but simply informs us of  his well-being. \"Pharaoh entreated Abram well for Sarai's sake; and he  had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants,  and she-asses, and camels.\" The collocation of the clauses implies that  all these were presents from the king. The pleased monarch lavished on  his brother-in-law such gifts of honour as were usual at the time and  suitable to his circumstances. Abraham became \"very rich in cattle, in  silver, and in gold\" (Gen. xiii. 2). He flourished greatly, whether for  months or for years the scripture does not say. He was separated from  his wife, and she was an inmate of Pharaoh's hareem; but he kept his  secret, and no one betrayed him. Apparently, he was content.    Ere long, however, a discovery was made. Calamity came upon the royal  house in some marked way, probably either in the form of sickness or of  death. The king became convinced that he was the object of a Divine  chastisement, and cast about for a cause to which his sufferings might  reasonably be attributed. How had he provoked God's anger? Either, as  Josephus thinks, the priests had by this time found out the truth, and  made the suggestion to him, that he was being punished for having taken  another man's wife into his seraglio; or possibly, as others have  surmised, Sarah herself divined the source of the calamities, and made  confession of the truth. At any rate, by some means or other, the facts  of the case became known; and the Pharaoh thereupon hastened to set  matters right. Sarah, though an inmate of the hareem, was probably still  in the probationary condition, undergoing the purification necessary  before the final completion of her nuptials (Esth. ii. 12), and could  thus be restored intact. The Pharaoh sent for Abraham, reproached him  with his deceit, pointed out the ill consequences which had followed,  and, doubtless in some displeasure, required him to take his wife and  depart. The famine was at an end, and there was no reason why he should  linger. Beyond reproach, however, Pharaoh inflicted no punishment. He  \"commanded his men concerning Abraham; and they sent him away, and his  wife, and _all that he had_.\"    Such is the account which has come down to us of Abraham's sojourn in  Egypt. If it be asked, Why is it inserted into the \"story of Egypt\" at  this point? the reply must be, because, on a dispassionate consideration  of all the circumstances, chronological and other, which attach to the  narrative, it has been generally agreed that the event belongs to  _about_ this time. There is no special reign to which it can be  definitely assigned; but the best critics acquiesce in the judgment of  Canon Cook upon the point, who says: \"For my own part, I regard it as  all but certain that Abraham visited Egypt in some reign between the  middle of the eleventh and the thirteenth dynasty, and most probably  under one of the earliest Pharaohs of the twelfth.\"[14]    This is not the only entrance of Hebrews or people of Semitic race into  Egypt. Emigrants from less favoured countries had frequently looked with  interest to the fertile Delta of the Nile, hoping that there they might  find homes free from the vicissitudes of their own. Previous to this,  one Amu had entered Egypt, perhaps from Midian, with his family,  counting thirty-seven, the little ones riding upon asses, and had sought  the protection of the reigning sovereign. It was again the experience  of Egypt to receive emigrants from the north-east, from Syria or  Northern Arabia, at a little later period, when the nomads in those  regions looked over to the south and, by contrast with their  over-peopled country, thought they saw a sort of \"fairy-land of wealth,  culture, and wisdom,\" which they hoped to enjoy by force: and they were  not the last to seek asylum there. We shall soon have to remark on the  familiar case of the immigration of the sons of Jacob with their  households. In process of time the Semitic wanderers increased so  materially that the population in the eastern half of the Delta "]]]
