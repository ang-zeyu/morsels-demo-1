Although a cease-fire has been in effect since May 1994, the  sides have not made substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution.  President TER-PETROSSIAN's latitude on the issue may be further  constrained by his controversial reelection in September 1996. When  supporters of the main opposition candidate stormed the parliament  following the announcement of TER-PETROSSIAN's victory, MVD forces  were called in to restore order. The subsequent political standoff  between government and opposition supporters diminished in late 1996  as the government has gradually attempted reconciliation. Despite  these political problems, the Armenian government has been pursuing  its aggressive economic reform program, although implementation of its  privatization program stalled in late 1996.    @Armenia:Geography    Location: Southwestern Asia, east of Turkey    Geographic coordinates: 40 00 N, 45 00 E    Map references: Commonwealth of Independent States    Area:  total : 29,800 sq km  land: 28,400 sq km  water: 1,400 sq km    Area - comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland    Land boundaries:  total: 1,254 km  border countries: Azerbaijan-proper 566 km, Azerbaijan-Naxcivan  exclave 221 km, Georgia 164 km, Iran 35 km, Turkey 268 km    Coastline: 0 km (landlocked)    Maritime claims: none (landlocked)    Climate: highland continental, hot summers, cold winters    Terrain: high Armenian Plateau with mountains; little forest land;  fast flowing rivers; good soil in Aras River valley    Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Debed River 400 m  highest point: Aragats Lerr 4,095 m    Natural resources: small deposits of gold, copper, molybdenum, zinc,  alumina    Land use:  arable land : 17%  permanent crops: 3%  permanent pastures: 24%  forests and woodland: 15%  other: 41% (1993 est.)

We kept the machine humming until far into the night,  as long as we could keep our eyes open.    All next day we sewed as hard as we could, and Gavotte cooked as hard  as he could. We had intended to have a tree for Jerrine, so we had a  box of candles and a box of Christmas snow. Gavotte asked for all the  bright paper we could find. We had lots of it, and I think you would be  surprised at the possibilities of a little waste paper. He made  gorgeous birds, butterflies, and flowers out of paper that once wrapped  parcels. Then he asked us for some silk thread, but I had none, so he  told us to comb our hair and give him the combings. We did, and with a  drop of mucilage he would fasten a hair to a bird's back and then hold  it up by the hair. At a few feet's distance it looked exactly as though  the bird was flying. I was glad I had a big stone jar full of  _fondant_, because we had a lot of fun shaping and coloring candies. We  offered a prize for the best representation of a \"nigger,\" and we had  two dozen chocolate-covered things that might have been anything from a  monkey to a mouse. Mrs. Louderer cut up her big plum pudding and put it  into a dozen small bags. These Gavotte carefully covered with green  paper. Then we tore up the holly wreath that Aunt Mary sent me, and put  a sprig in the top of each green bag of pudding. I never had so much  fun in my life as I had preparing for that Christmas.    At ten o'clock, the morning of the 24th, we were again on our way up  the mountain-side. We took shovels so we could clear a road if need  be. We had dinner at the old camp, and then Gavotte hunted us a way out  to the new, and we smuggled our things into Molly's cabin so the  children should have a real surprise. Poor, hopeless little things!  Theirs was, indeed, a dull outlook.    Gavotte busied himself in preparing one of the empty cabins for us and  in making the horses comfortable. He cut some pine boughs to do that  with, and so they paid no attention when he cut a small tree. In the  mean time we had cleared everything from Molly's cabin but her bed; we  wanted her to see the fun. The children were sent to the spring to  water the horses and they were all allowed to ride, so that took them  out of the way while Gavotte nailed the tree into a box he had filled  with dirt to hold it steady.    There were four women of us, and Gavotte, so it was only the work of a  few moments to get the tree ready, and it was the most beautiful one I  ever saw. Your largest bell, dear Mrs. Coney, dangled from the topmost  branch. Gavotte had attached a long, stout wire to your Santa Claus, so  he was able to make him dance frantically without seeming to do so. The  hairs that held the birds and butterflies could not be seen, and the  effect was beautiful. We had a bucket of apples rubbed bright, and  these we fastened to the tree just as they grew on their own branches.  The puddings looked pretty, too, and we had done up the parcels that  held the clothes as attractively as we could. We saved the candy and  the peanuts to put in their little stockings.    As soon as it was dark we lighted the candles and then their mother  called the children. Oh, if you could have seen them! It was the very  first Christmas tree they had ever seen and they didn't know what to  do. The very first present Gavotte handed out was a pair of trousers  for eight-years-old Brig, but he just stood and stared at the tree  until his brother next in size, with an eye to the main chance, got  behind him and pushed him forward, all the time exclaiming, \"Go on,  can't you! They ain't doin' nothin' to you, they's just doin' somethin'  for you.\" Still Brig would not put out his hand. He just shook his  tousled sandy head and said he wanted a bird. So the fun kept up for an  hour. Santa had for Molly a package of oatmeal, a pound of butter, a  Mason jar of cream, and a dozen eggs, so that she could have suitable  food to eat until something could be done.    After the presents had all been distributed we put the phonograph on a  box and had a dandy concert. We played \"There were Shepherds,\" \"Ave  Maria,\" and \"Sweet Christmas Bells.\" Only we older people cared for  those, so then we had \"Arrah Wanna,\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rainbow,\" \"Red  Wing,\" and such songs. How delighted they were! Our concert lasted two  hours, and by that time the little fellows were so sleepy that the  excitement no longer affected them and they were put to bed, but they  hung up their stockings first, and even Molly hung hers up too. We  filled them with peanuts and candy, putting the lion's share of  \"niggers\" into Molly's stocking.    Next morning the happiness broke out in new spots. The children were  all clean and warm, though I am afraid I can't brag on the fit of all  the clothes. But the pride of the wearers did away with the necessity  of a fit. The mother was radiantly thankful for a warm petticoat; that  it was made of a blanket too small for a bed didn't bother her, and the  stripes were around the bottom anyway. Molly openly rejoiced in her new  gown, and that it was made of ugly gray outing flannel she didn't know  nor care. Baby Star Crosby looked perfectly sweet in her little new  clothes, and her little gown had blue sleeves and they thought a white  skirt only added to its beauty. And so it was about everything. We all  got so much out of so little. I will never again allow even the  smallest thing to go to waste. We were every one just as happy as we  could be, almost as delighted as Molly was over her \"niggers,\" and  there was very little given that had not been thrown away or was not  just odds and ends.    There was never anything more true than that it is more blessed to give  than to receive. We certainly had a delicious dinner too, and we let  Molly have all she wanted that we dared allow her to eat. The roast  venison was so good that we were tempted to let her taste it, but we  thought better of that. As soon as dinner was over we packed our  belongings and betook ourselves homeward.    It was just dusk when we reached home. Away off on a bare hill a wolf  barked. A big owl hooted lonesomely among the pines, and soon a pack of  yelping coyotes went scampering across the frozen waste.    It was not the Christmas I had in mind when I sent the card, but it was  a _dandy_ one, just the same.    With best wishes for you for a happy, _happy_ New Year,      Sincerely your friend,      ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          XX    THE JOYS OF HOMESTEADING           _January 23, 1913._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I am afraid all my friends think I am very forgetful and that you think  I am ungrateful as well, but I am going to plead not guilty. Right  after Christmas Mr. Stewart came down with _la grippe_ and was so  miserable that it kept me busy trying to relieve him. Out here where we  can get no physician we have to dope ourselves, so that I had to be  housekeeper, nurse, doctor, and general overseer. That explains my long  silence.    And now I want to thank you for your kind thought in prolonging our  Christmas. The magazines were much appreciated. They relieved some  weary night-watches, and the box did Jerrine more good than the  medicine I was having to give her for _la grippe_. She was content to  stay in bed and enjoy the contents of her box.    When I read of the hard times among the Denver poor, I feel like urging  them every one to get out and file on land. I am very enthusiastic  about women homesteading. It really requires less strength and labor to  raise plenty to satisfy a large family than it does to go out to wash,  with the added satisfaction of knowing that their job will not be lost  to them if they care to keep it. Even if improving the place does go  slowly, it is that much done to stay done. Whatever is raised is the  homesteader's own, and there is no house-rent to pay. This year Jerrine  cut and dropped enough potatoes to raise a ton of fine potatoes. She  wanted to try, so we let her, and you will remember that she is but six  years old. We had a man to break the ground and cover the potatoes for  her and the man irrigated them once. That was all that was done until  digging time, when they were ploughed out and Jerrine picked them up.  Any woman strong enough to go out by the day could have done every bit  of the work and put in two or three times that much, and it would have  been so much more pleasant than to work so hard in the city and then be  on starvation rations in the winter.    To me, homesteading is the solution of all poverty's problems, but I  realize that temperament has much to do with success in any  undertaking, and persons afraid of coyotes and work and loneliness had  better let ranching alone. At the same time, any woman who can stand  her own company, can see the beauty of the sunset, loves growing  things, and is willing to put in as much time at careful labor as she  does over the washtub, will certainly succeed; will have independence,  plenty to eat all the time, and a home of her own in the end.    Experimenting need cost the homesteader no more than the work, because  by applying to the Department of Agriculture at Washington he can get  enough of any seed and as many kinds as he wants to make a thorough  trial, and it doesn't even cost postage. Also one can always get  bulletins from there and from the Experiment Station of one's own State  concerning any problem or as many problems as may come up. I would not,  for anything, allow Mr. Stewart to do anything toward improving my  place, for I want the fun and the experience myself. And I want to be  able to speak from experience when I tell others what they can do.  Theories are very beautiful, but facts are what must be had, and what I  intend to give some time.    Here I am boring you to death with things that cannot interest you!  You'd think I wanted you to homestead, wouldn't you? But I am only  thinking of the troops of tired, worried women, "]]]
