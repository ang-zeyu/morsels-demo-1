They were  matchless for rheumatism, especially in the legs. The old Empress,  Augusta, when in Baden, used to patronise this very hotel and no other.  They could show me the actual bath, and I myself could have pension  (baths excluded) for eight marks and fifty a day. If I would be so kind  as to step into the lift, I should see the room for myself, and then  with my permission they would bring in my luggage and pay the cab.    All this by degrees, from a pale youth in frock-coat and forage-cap, and  a more prosperous personage with _pince-nez_ and a paunch (yet another  concierge and my latest landlord respectively), while I stood making up  my mind. The closing proposition was of some assistance to me. I had no  luggage on the cab, of which the cabman's hat alone was visible, at the  bottom of a flight of steps, at the far end of the flagged approach. I  had left my luggage at the station, but I only recollected the fact upon  being recalled from a mental forecast of the interview before me to  these exceedingly petty preliminaries.    There and then I paid off the cab and found my own way to this  Conversationshaus. I liked the look of the trim, fresh town in its  perfect amphitheatre of pine-clad hills, covered in by a rich blue sky  from which the last clouds were exhaling like breath from a mirror. The  well-drained streets were drying clean as in a black frost; checkered  with sharp shadows, twinkling with shop windows, and strikingly free  from the more cumbrous forms of traffic. If this was Germany, I could  dispense with certain discreditable prejudices. I had to inquire my way  of a policeman in a flaming helm; because I could not understand his  copious directions, he led me to a tiny bridge within earshot of the  band, and there refused my proferred coin with the dignity of a  Hohenzollern. Under the tiny bridge there ran the shallowest and  clearest of little rivers. Up the white walls of the houses clambered a  deal of Virginia creeper, brought on by the rain, and now almost scarlet  in the strong sunlight. Presently at some gates there was a mark to pay,  or it may have been two; immediate admittance to an avenue of  fascinating shops, with an inner avenue of trees, little tables under  them, and the crash of the band growing louder at every yard. Eventual  access to a fine, broad terrace, a fine, long facade, a bandstand, and  people listening and walking up and down, people listening and drinking  beer or coffee at more little tables, people listening and reading on  rows of chairs, people standing to listen with all their ears; but not  for a long time the person I sought.           *       *       *       *       *    Not for a very long time, but yet, at last, and all alone, among the  readers on the chairs, deep in a Tauchnitz volume even here as in the  Alps; more daintily yet not less simply dressed, in pink muslin and a  big black hat; and blessed here as there with such blooming health, such  inimitable freshness, such a general air of well-being and of deep  content, as almost to disgust me after my whole week's search and my own  hourly qualms.    So I found Mrs. Lascelles in the end, and so I saw her until she looked  up and saw me; then the picture changed; but I am not going to describe  the change.    \"Well, really!\" she cried out.    \"It has taken me all the week to find you,\" said I, as I replaced my  hat.    Her eyes flashed again.    \"Has it, indeed! And now you have found me, aren't you satisfied? Pray  have a good look, Captain Clephane. You won't find anybody else!\"    Her meaning dawned on me at last.    \"I didn't expect to, Mrs. Lascelles.\"    \"Am I to believe that?\"    \"You must do as you please. It is the truth. Mrs. Lascelles, I have been  all the week looking for you and you alone.\"    I spoke with some warmth, for not only did I speak the truth, but it had  become more and more the truth at every stage of my journey since  Brigues. Mrs. Lascelles leant back in her chair and surveyed me with  less anger, but with the purer and more pernicious scorn.    \"And what business had you to do that?\" she asked calmly. \"How dare you,  I should like to know?\"    \"I dared,\" said I, \"because I owed you a debt which, I felt, must be  paid in person, or it would never be paid at all. Mrs. Lascelles, I  owed and do owe you about the most abject apology man ever made! I have  followed you all this way for no other earthly reason than to make it,  in all sincere humility. But it has taken me more or less since Tuesday  morning; and I can't kneel here. Do you mind if I sit down?\"    Mrs. Lascelles drew in the hem of her pink muslin, with an all but  insufferable gesture of unwilling resignation. I took the next chair but  one, but, leaning my elbow on the chair-back between us, was rather the  gainer by the intervening inches, which enabled me to study a perfect  profile and the most wonderful colouring as I could scarcely have done  at still closer range. She never turned to look at me, but simply  listened while the band played, and people passed, and I said my say. It  was very short: there was so little that she did not know. There was the  excitement about Bob, his subsequent reappearance, our scene in his room  and my last sight of him in the morning; but the bare facts went into  few words, and there was no demand for details. Mrs. Lascelles seemed to  have lost all interest in her latest lover; but when I tried to speak  of my own hateful hand in that affair, to explain what I could of it,  but to extenuate nothing, and to apologise from my heart for it all,  then there was a change in her, then her blood mounted, then her bosom  heaved, and I was silenced by a single flash from her eyes.    \"Yes,\" said she, \"you could let him think you were in earnest, you could  pose as his rival, you could pretend all that! Not to me, I grant you!  Even you did not go quite so far as that; or was it that you knew that I  should see through you? You made up for it, however, the other night.  That I never, never, never shall forgive. I, who had never seriously  thought of accepting him, who was only hesitating in order to refuse him  in the most deliberate and final manner imaginable--I, to have the word  put into my mouth--by you! I, who was going in any case, of my own  accord, to be told to go--by you! One thing you will never know, Captain  Clephane, and that is how nearly you drove me into marrying him just to  spite you and his miserable mother. I meant to do it, that night when I  left you. It would have served you right if I had!\"    She did not rise. She did not look at me again. But I saw the tears  standing in her eyes, one I saw roll down her cheek, and the sight smote  me harder than her hardest word, though more words followed in broken  whispers.    \"It wasn't because I cared ... that you hurt me as you did. I never did  care for him ... like that. It was ... because ... you seemed to think  my society contamination ... to an honest boy. I did care for him, but  not like that. I cared too much for him to let him marry me ... to  contaminate him for life!\"    I repudiated the reiterated word with all my might. I had never used it,  even in my thoughts; it had never once occurred to me in connection with  her. Had I not shown as much? Had I behaved as though I feared  contamination for myself? I rapped out these questions with undue  triumph, in my heat, only to perceive their second edge as it cut me to  the quick.    \"But you were playing a part,\" retorted Mrs. Lascelles. \"You don't deny  it. Are you proud of it, that you rub it in? Or are you going to begin  denying it now?\"    Unfortunately, that was impossible. Tt was too late for denials. But,  driven into my last corner, as it seemed, I relapsed for the moment into  thought, and my thoughts took the form of a rapid retrospect of all the  hours that this angry woman and I had spent together. I was introduced  to her again by poor Bob. I recognised her again by the light of a  match, and accosted her next morning in the strong sunshine. We went for  our first walk together. We sat together on the green ledge overlooking  the glaciers, and first she talked about herself, and then we both  talked about Bob, and then Bob appeared in the flesh and gave me my  disastrous idea. Then there was the day on the Findelen that we had all  three spent together. Then there was the walk home from early church  (short as it had been), the subsequent expedition to Zermatt and back,  with its bright beginning and its clouded end. Up to that point, at all  events, they had been happy hours, so many of them unburdened by a  single thought of Bob Evers and his folly, not one of them haunted by  the usual sense of a part that is played. I almost wondered as I  realised this. I supposed it would be no use attempting to express  myself to Mrs. Lascelles, but I felt I must say something before I went,  so I said:    \"I deny nothing, and I'm proud of nothing, but neither am I quite so  ashamed as perhaps I ought to be. Shall I tell you why, Mrs. Lascelles?  It may have been an insolent and an infamous part, as you imply; but I  enjoyed playing it, and I used often to forget it was a part at all. So  much so that even now I'm not so sure that it was one! There--I suppose  that makes it all ten times worse. But I won't apologise again. Do you  mind giving me that stick?\"    I had rested the two of them against the chair between us. Mrs.  Lascelles had taken possession of one, with which she was methodically  probing the path, for there had been no time to draw their Alpine teeth.  She did not comply with my request. She smiled instead.    \"I mind very much,\" her old voice said. \"Now we have finished fighting,  perhaps you will listen to the _Meistersinger_--for it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#20)"],[1,"sphere of work will be done  away with.    Percival himself, always a strong advocate for the operation, fully  recognises this. 'Does the neurotomized horse maintain the same step  as before?' he asks. 'To this important question,' he replies, 'I  unhesitatingly answer no; he does not. There can be no doubt but that the  horse _feels_ the ground upon which he is treading, and that he regulates  his action in consonance with such feeling, so as to render his step the  least jarring and fatiguing to himself, and therefore the easiest and  pleasantest to his rider.... Such impressions'--those of touch--'being  in the neurotomized subject, so far as regards the feeling of the foot,  altogether wanting, a bold, fearless projection of the limb in action will  be the consequence, followed by a putting down of the hoof flat upon the  ground, as though it were a block, creating a sensation alike unpleasant  both to horse and rider.'    Emphatic as Percival is upon this point, there are, nevertheless, others  who maintain with equal stoutness that the unnerved animal is positively as  safe, if not safer, than the animal who has not been so treated.    'That the tactile sense in the horse's foot is useful, it would be idle to  deny; but that it is absolutely essential, even to safe progression, no one  who has paid attention to the results of plantar neurectomy will maintain.  On several occasions for years I have hunted, hacked, and driven horses  which have been deprived of sensation in their fore-feet, and never had an  accident with them. Their action has not been impaired by the operation; on  the contrary, it has been vastly improved compared with what it had been  previous to it. And my opinion has not been single in this respect, as many  competent horsemen can give like evidence after long and severe trials of  neurotomized horses. The opponents of neurotomy were, probably, not aware  that there is in progression a _muscular_ as well as a _tactile sense_.'    This latter contention is supported by numerous cases, reported at the time  when the operation of neurectomy was at the heyday of its popularity. Two I  select from writings of a later period:    _Recorded Cases_.--1. 'Two of the finest among the many fine horses in the  Second Life Guards were so lame from navicular disease, when I joined the  regiment, that they were unsafe and unsightly to ride, and were therefore  entered on the list to be cast off and sold. One was so crippled that it  could scarcely be moved out of its stable. Peeling sorry at having to get  rid of such good horses, and anxious to give another blow to the mistaken  theory that unnerved animals were unsafe, I obtained the consent of my  commanding officer, who patronizes practical conclusions, to perform  neurotomy. This was carried out on both horses about eighteen months ago.  Within a fortnight they were at their duty, absolutely free from lameness,  and with first-rate action, and one of them, from being troublesome and  unsteady in the ranks--probably from the pain in its feet--had become quite  steady and tractable. Instead of being lame, blundering, and unsafe, both  were sound, free in movement, and secure, and, the pain being abolished,  they looked improved in condition.    'During the month of July the regiment attended the summer drills at  Aldershot, and five days every week for a month these horses carried a  weight of about 22 stones each over the roughest and most dangerous ground,  nearly always at a fast pace, and for four, five, or six hours each day;  and yet they never fell or blundered, and the troopers who rode them had  unbounded confidence in their sure-footedness. They returned to Windsor, at  the end of the month's severe test, as sound in their paces as when they  left, and certainly now offer no indication whatever that they are less  safe to ride than any other horse in the regiment. The effects of the  relief from pain are also most marked, not only in the altered gait out of  doors, but also in the stable.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Journal, vol_. ix., p. 178 (George Fleming,  F.B.C.V.S.).]    2. 'Some years ago I operated upon a valuable hunter, the property of a  gentleman in Kildare, the animal having shown unmistakable symptoms  of navicular disease for some months previously, and which had been  unsuccessfully combated by the milder forms of treatment for the disease  without any benefit. Although the horse went sound, the owner feared to  ride him, and sent him to be sold in Dublin, where he was disposed of for a  small price, and I then lost sight of him. The following Punchestown  Races, to my surprise, amongst a group of horses walking round the paddock  previous to saddling for an important race, I recognised my old patient,  bandaged, clothed, and trained, ready to take his part in the cross-country  contest, and surrounded by a host of admirers willing to back him at any  price.    'Having satisfied myself that it was no other than the same animal, my  first impulse was at once to find out the jockey who was to ride him, and  warn him of his danger by telling him his mount was devoid of feeling  in both fore-feet; but the saddling-bell had already rung, and in a few  moments more the jockey emerged from the weighing-room and the next view of  the horse was his tearing up the course in the preliminary, and \"pulling  double.\" I was sorry for the jockey if he felt as I did at that moment, for  if he did I fear he and his horse would have parted company at the first  fence, as I was certain there would be a smash before the end of the long  and difficult three miles of the Kildare Hunt Cup course. It was not until  I saw him again in the front rank passing the stand, in the first round,  that I breathed freely, and even then I felt very guilty, and, had he come  to grief badly, I don't think I should ever have operated on another horse  except in such a way as would have left unmistakable traces after it.    '\"The old horse wins!\" screamed a thousand voices as the competitors safely  cleared the last bank (now taken away for a gorse fence) the last time  round, and from that moment the operation went up in my estimation a  hundredfold, and I almost lost all interest in the finish (and it was a  close one, with my patient a good third), resolving I would operate for the  future on every animal, young and old, which showed symptoms of navicular  disease.    'Neither owner nor jockey knew the horse had been operated on, and he was  soon after, on the strength of his performance, sold for a good price to  come to England. It is idle to think that all cases are as successful as  this was, as experience soon told me; but I consider that, in careful  hands, the advantages well outweigh the disadvantages of the operation, and  I have selected this instance merely as a practical example.'[A]    [Footnote A: _Veterinary Journal_, vol. iii., p. 254 (W. Pallin,  M.B.C.V.S.).]    It is solely with the object of ventilating both sides of the question  that we quote the last two cases. In our opinion, the colours in which  the results of the operation are there painted are far too rosy. The  practitioner who has before him the task of satisfying a client as to what  will or what will not be the results of an operation he has suggested will  do well to weigh each side of the argument carefully, and endeavour in his  explanation to strike the happy mean.    We hold, further, that the animal who has previously been accustomed to  fast work, and to work entailing a large call upon the sense of touch when  passing over rough and uneven ground, will be far more likely, in his  neurectomized condition, to give satisfaction to his owner if put to a  slower and a more suitable means of earning his living.        CHAPTER VI    FAULTY CONFORMATION      Under this heading we shall deal with such formations of the feet as depart  sufficiently from the normal to render them serious. Faulty conformation  may be either congenital or acquired, and acquired gradually as the result  of slowly operating causes, or suddenly as the sequel to previous acute  disease. Whether congenital or acquired, serious in its nature or  comparatively of no account, the veterinary surgeon will often find that  the matter of conformation is one which will have a direct bearing on many  of his 'foot' cases, and, furthermore, that it is one upon which he will  often be called to give advice.      A. WEAK HEELS.    _Definition_.--That condition of the wall in which, owing to the softness  of the horn and the oblique direction of the horn fibres, the heels are  unable properly to bear the body-weight, and, as a consequence, curve in  beneath the sole. We give the condition first mention, not because of its  greater importance, but for the reason that it is frequently the forerunner  of the condition to be next described--namely, contracted feet.    _Symptoms_.--The extreme point of the heel is not affected unless the foot  has been greatly neglected, and the condition allowed to develop. Where,  however, the foot has been uncared for, curving in of the wall takes place  to an alarming degree, and the heels curl underneath the foot to such an  extent as to grow over the sole and the bars. By the pressure they exert on  the sole corns result, and the animal is lamed.    _Causes_.--In the main this defect is hereditary. It is seen commonly in  connection with flat-foot, and where the horn of the wall is thin and  shelly.    _Treatment_.--In the case of weak or 'turned in' heels no suitable bearing  is offered for the shoe in the posterior half of the foot. Any attempt to  induce the heels to bear weight is immediately followed by their bending  in. It follows from this that the best shoe to be used here is one in which  the bearing is confined to the anterior half of the wall, the heels being  relieved by being sufficiently pared. As might be expected, this bearing on  the anterior"]]]
