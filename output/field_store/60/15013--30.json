They had friends, too, strung out all over--squatters  and the like of that. They'd drop in on these little fellers and pass  'em a couple of twenties and make themselves solid for life. Afterward  they used 'em for stoppin' places.    \"They'd pull off a couple of hold-ups, then they'd ride off to one of  these squatter places and lay up for ten days, maybe, drinkin' and  feedin' up themselves and their hosses. That was the only way they was  ever caught. They was killed off by each other, fighting about the  split-up, or something like that.    \"But now and then a gang held together long enough to raise so much hell  that they got known from one end of the range to the other. Mostly they  held together because they had a leader who knew how to handle 'em and  who kept 'em under his thumb. That was the way with old Piotto.    \"He had five men under him. They was all hell-benders who had ridden the  range alone and had their share of fights and killings, which there  wasn't one of 'em that wouldn't have been good enough to go leader in  any other crew, but they had to knuckle under to old Piotto. He was a  great gunman and he was pretty good in scheming up ways of dodging the  law and picking the best booty. He had these five men, and then he had  his daughter, Joan. She was better'n two ordinary men herself.    \"Three years that gang held together and got rich--fair rich. They made  it so fast they couldn't even gamble the stuff away. About a thousand  times, I guess posses went out after Piotto, but they never came back  with a trace of 'em; they never got within shootin' distance. Finally  Piotto got so confident that he started raidin' ranches and carryin' off  members of well-off ranchers to hold for ransom. That was the easiest  way of makin' money; it was also pretty damned dangerous.    \"One time they held up a stage and picked off of it two kids who was  comin' out from the East to try their hands in the cattle business. They  was young, they looked like gentlemen, they was dressed nifty, and they  packed big rolls. So wise old Piotto took 'em off into the hills and  held 'em till their folks back East could wire out the money to save  'em. That was easy money for Piotto, but that was the beginnin' of the  end for him; because while they was waitin', them two kids seen Joan and  seen her good.    \"I been telling you she was better'n two common men. She was. Which  means she was equal to about ten ordinary girls. There's still a legend  about how beautiful Joan Piotto was--tall and straight and big black  eyes and terrible handy with her gun. She could ride anything that  walked and she didn't know what fear meant.    \"These two kids seen her. One of 'em was William Drew; one of 'em was  John Bard.\"    He turned to Anthony and saw that the latter was stern of face. He had  surely scored his point.    \"Same name as yours, eh?\" he asked, to explain his turning.    \"It's a common enough name,\" murmured Bard.    \"Well, them two had come out to be partners, and there they was, fallin'  in love with the same girl. So when they got free they put their heads  together--bein' uncommon wise kids--and figured it out this way. Neither  of 'em had a chance workin' alone to get Joan way from her father's  gang, but workin' together they might have a ghost of a show. So they  decided to stay on the trail of Piotto till they got Joan. Then they'd  give her a choice between the two of 'em and the one that lost would  simply back off the boards.    \"They done what they agreed. For six months they stuck on the trail of  old Piotto and never got in hailin' distance of him. Then they come on  the gang while they were restin' up in the house of a squatter.    \"That was a pretty night. Drew and Bard went through that gang. It  sounds like a nice fairy-story, all right, but I know old fellers who'll  swear it's true. They killed three of the men with their guns; they  knifed another one, an' they killed Riley with their bare hands. It  wasn't no pretty sight to see--the inside of that house. And last of all  they got Piotto, fightin' like an old wildcat, into a corner with his  daughter; and William Drew, he took Piotto into his arms and busted his  back. That don't sound possible, but when you see Drew you'll know how  it was done.    \"The girl, she'd been knocked cold before this happened. So while Bard  and Drew sat together bindin' up each other's wounds--because they was  shot pretty near to pieces--they talked it over and they seen pretty  clear that the girl would never marry the man that had killed her  father. Of course, old Bill Drew, he'd done the killing, but that wasn't  any reason why he had to take the blame.    \"They made up their minds that right there and then with the dead men  lyin' all around 'em, they'd match coins to see which one would take the  blame of havin' killed Piotto--meanin' that the other one would get the  girl--if he could.    \"And Bard lost. So he had to take the credit of havin' killed old  Piotto. I'd of give something to have seen the two of 'em sittin'  there--oozin' blood--after that marchin' was decided. Because they tell  me that Bard was as big as Drew and looked pretty much the same.    \"Then Bard, he asked Drew to let him have one chance at the girl,  lettin' her know first what he'd done, but jest trustin' to his power of  talk. Which, of course, didn't give him no show. While he was makin'  love to the girl she outs with a knife and tries to stick him--nice,  pleasant sort she must have been--and Drew, he had to pry the two of 'em  apart.    \"That made the girl look sort of kind on Drew and she swore that sooner  or later she'd have the blood of Bard for what he'd done--either have it  herself or else send someone after him to the end of the world. She was  a wild one, all right.    \"She was so wild that Drew, after they got married, took her over on the  far side of the range and built that old house that's rottin' there  now. Bard, he left the range and wasn't never seen again, far as I  know.\"    It was clear to Anthony, bitterly clear. His father had had a grim scene  in parting with Drew and had placed the continent between them. And in  the Eastern states he had met that black-eyed girl, his mother, and  loved her because she was so much like the wild daughter of Piotto. The  girl Joan in dying had probably extracted from Drew a promise that he  would kill Bard, and that promise he had lived to fulfil.    \"So Joan died?\" he queried.    \"Yep, and was buried under them two trees in front of the house. I don't  think she lived long after they was married, but about that nobody  knows. They was clear off by themselves and there isn't any one can tell  about their life after they was married. All we know is that Drew didn't  get over her dyin'. He ain't over it yet, and goes out to the old place  every month or so to potter around the grave and keep the grass and the  weeds off of it and clean the head-stone.\"    The candle guttered wildly on the floor. It had burnt almost to the wood  and now the remnant of the wick stood in a little sprawling pool of  grease white at the outer edges.    Bard yawned, and patted idly the blanket where it touched on the shape  of the revolver beneath. In another moment that candle would gutter out  and they would be left in darkness.    He said: \"That's the best yarn I've heard in a good many days; it's  enough to make any one sleepy--so here goes.\"    And he turned deliberately on his side.    Nash, his eyes staring with incredulity, sat up slowly among his  blankets and his hand stole up toward the noose of the lariat. A light  snore reached him, hardly a snore so much as the heavy intake of breath  of a very weary, sleeping man; yet the hand of Nash froze on the lariat.    \"By God,\" he whispered faintly to himself, \"he ain't asleep!\"    And the candle flared wildly, leaped, and shook out.          CHAPTER XXI      THE SWIMMING OF THE SAVERACK    Over the face of Nash the darkness passed like a cold hand and a colder  sense of failure touched his heart; but men who have ridden the range  have one great power surpassing all others--the power of patience. As  soundlessly as he had pushed himself up the moment before, he now  slipped down in the blankets and resigned himself to sleep.    He knew that he would wake at the first hint of grey light and trusted  that after the long ride of the day before his companion would still be  fast asleep. That half light would be enough for his work; but when he  roused while the room was still scarcely more visible than if it were  filled with a grey fog, he found Bard already up and pulling on his  boots.    \"How'd you sleep?\" he growled, following the example of the tenderfoot.    \"Not very well,\" said the other cheerily. \"You see, that story of yours  was so vivid in my mind that I stayed awake about all night, I guess,  thinking it over.\"    \"I knew it,\" murmured Nash to himself. \"He was awake all the time. And  still-----\"    If that thrown noose of the lariat had settled over the head and  shoulders of the sham sleeper it would have made no difference whether  he waked or slept--in the end he would have sat before William Drew tied  hand and foot. If that noose had not settled? The picture of the little  piece of paper fluttering to the floor came back with a strange  vividness to the mind of Nash, and he had to shrug his shoulders to  shake the thought away.    They were in the saddle a very few moments after they awoke and started  out, breakfastless. The rain long ago had ceased, and there was only the  solemn silence of the brown hills around them--silence, and a faint,  crinkling sound as if the thirsty soil still drank. It had been a heavy  fall of rain, they could see, for whenever they passed a bare spot where  no grass grew, it was crossed by a thick tracery of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11102"],[0,"History of Negro Soldiers in the Spanish-American War, and Other Items of (#20)"],[1,"service at the front,  and, as the Hispano-American war is practically a closed chapter, it  will probably be mustered out of the service without any knowledge of  actual warfare. I thought, however, as I stood on the dry goods box  and gave them kindly advice, and looked down along the line, that if  I was a soldier in a white regiment and was pitted against them, my  regiment would have to do some mighty lively work to \"clean them out.\"    CHARLES FRANCIS MESERVE.

MISS ALBERTA SCOTT AND OTHERS,    Miss Alberta Scott is the first Negro girl to be graduated from the  Harvard annex. Her classmates and the professors of the institution  have congratulated her in the warmest terms and in the literary and  the language club of Boston her achievement of the M.A. degree has  been spoken of with high praise. Miss Scott is but the fifth student  of the Negro race to obtain this honor at the colleges for women in  Massachusetts. Two received diplomas from Wellsley, one from Smith  College and one from Vassar. Miss Scott is 20 years old. She was born  in Richmond, Va., having graduated from the common schools in Boston.  Miss Scott's teachers spoke so encouragingly of her work that the  girl was determined to have a college education. She paid particular  attention to the study of language and literature, and she is now a  fluent linguist and a member of the Idier and German clubs. She has  contributed considerably to college and New England journals.    [Illustration: THE GARNES FAMILY.]    THE DISCOVERY OF THE GARNES FAMILY.    A picture of which is herein placed, will do much to confound those  bumptious sociologists who make haste to rush into print with  statistics purporting to show that the Negro Race in America is \"fast  dying out.\" The aim of this class of people seems to be to show that  the Negro Race withers under the influence of freedom, which is by no  means true. It is possibly true that filth and disease does its fatal  work in the Negro Race, the same as in other races among the filthy  and corrupt, but the filthy and corrupt in the Negro Race, as a class,  are growing fewer every year--for which we can thank the philanthropy  of the American people who are doing something to better the condition  of the Negro rather than hurling at him enernating criticisms and  complaints.    \"Their home is at Brodie, in the country, about twenty miles from  Henderson, N.C. The father's name is Gillis Garnes. He is about fifty  years of age, and the mother says she is about forty-eight.

They are all Baptists and thirteen of the family are members of  the church. I had this photograph taken at Henderson, on April 8th.  There are seventeen children, all living, of the same father and  mother. A.J. Garnes spends quite a part of the time in teaching in  his native county.

Meserve, in the Baptist Home  Mission Monthly._    \"A COLORED WONDER\" ON THE BICYCLE.    New York, August 27.--Major Taylor, the colored cyclist, met and  defeated \"Jimmy\" Michael, the little Welshman, in a special match  race, best two out of three, one mile pace heats, from a standing  start at Manhattan Beach Cycle track this afternoon.    Michael won the first heat easily, as Taylor's pacing quint broke  down in the final lap, but on the next two heats Michael was so badly  beaten and distanced that he quit each time in the last lap.    MARVELOUS WORK.    Taylor's work was wonderful, both from a racing and time standpoint,  and he established a new world's record which was absolutely  phenomenal, covering the third heat in 1:41 2-5.    Michael was hissed by the spectators as he passed the stand,  dispirited and dejected by Taylor's overwhelming victory.    Immediately after the third heat was finished, and before the time was  announced, William A. Bradley, who championed the colored boy during  the entire season, issued a challenge to race Taylor against Michael  for $5,000 or $10,000 a side at any distance up to one hundred miles.    THE COLORED YOUTH LIONIZED.    This declaration was received with tumultuous shouts by the  assemblage, and the colored victor was lionized when the time was made  known.    Edouard Taylore, the French rider, held the world's record of 1:45 3-5  for the distance in a contest paced from a standing start.    [Illustration: COLEMAN COTTON MILL.]    THE WORLD'S RECORD LOWERED.    The world's record against time from a standing start, made by Platt  Betts, of England, was 1:43 2-5. Michael beat Taylore's record by 1  2-5 seconds in the first heat, but Major Taylor wiped this out and  tied Betts' record against time in the second heat. As Taylor was on  the outside for nearly two and a half laps, it was easily seen that he  rode more than a mile in the time, and shrewd judges who watched the  race said that he would surely do better on the third attempt.    PALE AS A CORPSE.    That he fully justified this belief goes without saying.    The Welsh rider was pale as a corpse when he jumped off his wheel and  had no excuse to make for his defeat. Taylor's performance undoubtedly  stamps him as the premier 'cycle sprinter of the world, and, judging  from the staying qualities he exhibited in his six days' ride in the  Madison Square Garden, the middle distance championship may be his  before the end of the present season.      A NEGRO MILLIONAIRE FOUND AT LAST.    After a search of many years, at last a Negro millionaire, yes, a  multi-millionaire has been found. He resides in the city of Guatemala,  and is known as Don Juan Knight. It is said he is to that country what  Huntington and other monied men are to this country. He was born a  slave in the State of Alabama. He owns gold mines, large coffee and  banana farms, is the second largest dealer in mahogany in the world,  owns a bank and pays his employees $200,000 a year. His wealth is  estimated at $70,000,000. He was the property of the Uptons, of  Dadeville, Ala. He contributes largely to educational institutions,  has erected hospitals, etc. He is sought for his advice by the  government whenever a bond issue, etc., is to be made. He lives in a  palace and has hosts of servants to wait on his family. He married a  native and has seven children. They have all been educated in this  country. Two of his sons are in a military academy in Mississippi and  one of his daughters is an accomplished portrait painter in Boston. He  visited the old plantation where he was born recently and employed the  son of his former master as foreman of his mines. Finding that the  wife of his former master was sick and without money, he gave her  enough money to live on the balance of her life. He employs more  men than any other man in Guatemala and is the wealthiest one  there.--Maxton Blade.      UNCLE SAM'S MONEY SEALER WHO COULD STEAL MILLIONS IF HE WOULD.
