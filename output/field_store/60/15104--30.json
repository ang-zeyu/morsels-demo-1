Is he in reality one  whit more respectable than the industrious lad who sweeps stores, or  carries bottles, without troubling himself with the idea that all the  world is observing his little unimportant self? For, in relation to  the rest of the world, each individual is unimportant; and he alone  is wise who forms his habits according to his own wants, his own  prospects, and his own principles.          TRAVELLING AND PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS.      There is one kind of extravagance rapidly increasing in this country,  which, in its effects on our purses and our _habits_, is one of the  worst kinds of extravagance; I mean the rage for travelling, and  for public amusements. The good old home habits of our ancestors are  breaking up--it will be well if our virtue and our freedom do not  follow them! It is easy to laugh at such prognostics,--and we are well  aware that the virtue we preach is considered almost obsolete,--but  let any reflecting mind inquire how decay has begun in all republics,  and then let them calmly ask themselves whether we are in no danger,  in departing thus rapidly from the simplicity and industry of our  forefathers.    Nations do not plunge _at once_ into ruin--governments do not change  _suddenly_--the causes which bring about the final blow, are scarcely  perceptible in the beginning; but they increase in numbers, and in  power; they press harder and harder upon the energies and virtue of a  people; and the last steps only are alarmingly hurried and irregular.  A republic without industry, economy, and integrity, is Samson  shorn of his locks. A luxurious and idle _republic_! Look at the  phrase!--The words were never made to be married together; every body  sees it would be death to one of them.    And are not _we_ becoming luxurious and idle? Look at our steamboats,  and stages, and taverns! There you will find mechanics, who have left  debts and employment to take care of themselves, while they go to take  a peep at the great canal, or the opera-dancers. There you will find  domestics all agog for their wages-worth of travelling; why should  they look out for 'a rainy day?' There are hospitals enough to provide  for them in sickness; and as for marrying, they have no idea of that,  till they can find a man who will support them genteelly. There you  will find mothers, who have left the children at home with Betsey,  while they go to improve their minds at the Mountain House, or the  Springs.    If only the rich did this, all would be well. They benefit others, and  do not injure themselves. In any situation, idleness is their curse,  and uneasiness is the tax they must pay for affluence; but their  restlessness is as great a benefit to the community as the motions of  Prince Esterhazy, when at every step the pearls drop from his coat.    People of moderate fortune have just as good a right to travel as the  wealthy; but is it not unwise? Do they not injure themselves and their  families? You say travelling is cheap. So is staying at home. Besides,  do you count _all_ the costs?    The money you pay for stages and steamboats is the smallest of the  items. There are clothes bought which would not otherwise be bought;  those clothes are worn out and defaced twenty times as quick as they  would have been at home; children are perhaps left with domestics,  or strangers; their health and morals, to say the least, under very  uncertain influence; your substance is wasted in your absence by those  who have no self-interest to prompt them to carefulness; you form an  acquaintance with a multitude of people, who will be sure to take  your house in their way, when they travel next year; and finally, you  become so accustomed to excitement, that home appears insipid, and  it requires no small effort to return to the quiet routine of your  duties. And what do you get in return for all this? Some pleasant  scenes, which will soon seem to you like a dream; some pleasant faces,  which you will never see again; and much of crowd, and toil, and dust,  and bustle.    I once knew a family which formed a striking illustration of my  remarks. The man was a farmer, and his wife was an active, capable  woman, with more of ambition than sound policy. Being in debt, they  resolved to take fashionable boarders from Boston, during the summer  season. These boarders, at the time of their arrival, were projecting  a jaunt to the Springs; and they talked of Lake George crystals, and  Canadian music, and English officers, and 'dark blue Ontario,' with  its beautiful little brood of _lakelets_, as Wordsworth would call  them; and how one lady was dressed superbly at Saratoga; and how  another was scandalized for always happening to drop her fan in the  vicinity of the wealthiest beaux. All this fired the quiet imagination  of the good farmer's wife; and no sooner had the boarders departed to  enjoy themselves in spite of heat, and dust, and fever-and-ague, than  she stated her determination to follow them. 'Why have we not as good  a right to travel, as they have?' said she; 'they have paid us money  enough to go to Niagara with; and it really is a shame for people to  live and die so ignorant of their own country.' 'But then we want the  money to pay for that stock, which turned out unlucky, you know.' 'Oh,  that can be done next summer; we can always get boarders enough, and  those that will pay handsomely. Give the man a mortgage of the house,  to keep him quiet till next summer.' 'But what will you do with the  children?' 'Sally is a very smart girl; I am sure she will take as  good care of them as if I were at home.'    To make a long story short, the farmer and his wife concluded to go  to Quebec, just to show they had a _right_ to put themselves to  inconvenience, if they pleased. They went; spent all their money; had  a watch stolen from them in the steamboat; were dreadfully sea-sick  off Point Judith; came home tired, and dusty; found the babe sick,  because Sally had stood at the door with it, one chilly, damp morning,  while she was feeding the chickens; and the eldest girl screaming  and screeching at the thoughts of going to bed, because Sally, in  order to bring her under her authority, had told her a frightful  'raw-head-and-bloody-bones' story; the horse had broken into the  garden, and made wretched work with the vegetables; and fifty pounds  of butter had become fit for the grease-pot, because the hoops of the  firkin had sprung, and Sally had so much to do, that she never thought  of going to see whether the butter was covered with brine.    After six or eight weeks, the children were pretty well restored  to orderly habits; and the wife, being really a notable and prudent  woman, resolved to make up for her lost butter and vegetables, by  doing without help through the winter. When summer came, they should  have boarders, she said; and sure enough, they had boarders in plenty;  but not profitable ones. There were forty cousins, at whose houses  they had stopped; and twenty people who had been very polite to them  on the way; and it being such a pleasant season, and _travelling so  cheap_, everyone of these people felt they had _a right_ to take  a journey; and they could not help passing a day or two with their  friends at the farm. One after another came, till the farmer could  bear it no longer. 'I tell you what, wife,' said he, 'I am going to  jail as fast as a man can go. If there is no other way of putting  a stop to this, I'll sell every bed in the house, except the one we  sleep on.'    And sure enough, he actually did this; and when the forty-first cousin  came down on a friendly visit, on account of what her other cousins  had told her about the cheapness of travelling, she was told  they should be very happy to sleep on the floor, for the sake of  accommodating her, for a night or two; but the truth was, they had but  one bed in the house. This honest couple are now busy in paying off  their debts, and laying by something for their old age. He facetiously  tells how he went to New York to have his watch stolen, and his boots  blacked like a looking glass; and she shows her Lake George diamond  ring, and tells how the steamboat was crowded, and how afraid she was  the boiler would burst, and always ends by saying, 'After all, it was  a toil of pleasure.'    However, it is not our farmers, who are in the greatest danger of this  species of extravagance; for we look to that class of people, as the  strongest hold of republican simplicity, industry, and virtue. It is  from adventurers, swindlers, broken down traders,--all that rapidly  increasing class of idlers, too genteel to work, and too proud to  beg,--that we have most reason to dread examples of extravagance. A  very respectable tavern-keeper has lately been driven to establish a  rule, that no customer shall be allowed to rise from the table till  he pays for his meal. 'I know it is rude to give such orders to honest  men,' said he, 'and three years ago I would as soon cut off my hand  as have done it; but now, travelling is so cheap, that all sorts of  characters are on the move; and I find more than half of them will get  away, if they can, without paying a cent.'    With regard to public amusements, it is still worse. Rope-dancers,  and opera-dancers, and all sorts of dancers, go through the country,  making thousands as they go; while, from high to low, there is one  universal, despairing groan of 'hard times,' 'dreadful gloomy times!'    These things ought not to be. People who have little to spend, should  partake sparingly of useless amusements; those who are in debt  should deny themselves entirely. Let me not be supposed to inculcate  exclusive doctrines. I would have every species of enjoyment as open  to the poor as to the rich; but I would have people consider well how  they are likely to obtain the greatest portion of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#20)"],[1,"water where the stony creek  bottom had been and a steady current over the low place left as an  overflow in the middle of the dam.    What a thrill of pleasure that was!    \"Last in's a dirty sucker.\"    \"Look out for my bad knee,\" was the response.    The rest of the race was a mixture of stripping and sprinting and the  boys splashed in together.    Five feet deep in the deep hole, a hundred yards long, and all their  own doing.    \"Now, wasn't it worth it?\" asked Yan, who had had much difficulty in  keeping Sam steadily at play that looked so very much like work.    \"Wonder how that got here? I thought I left that in the teepee?\" and  Sam pointed to a log that he used for a seat in the teepee, but now it  was lodged in the overflow.    Yan was a good swimmer, and as they played and splashed, Sam said:  \"Now I know who you are. You can't hide it from me no longer. I  suspicioned it when you were working on the dam. You're that tarnal  Redskin they call 'Little Beaver.'\"    \"I've been watching you,\" retorted Yan, \"and it seems to me I've run up  against that copper-coloured scallawag--'Young-Man-Afraid-of-a-Shovel.'\"    [Illustration: The dam was a great success]    \"No, you don't,\" said Sam. \"Nor I ain't  '_Bald-Eagle-Settin'-on-a-Rock-with-his-Tail-Hangin'-over-the-Edge,'_  nuther. In fact, I don't keer to be recognized just now. Ain't it a  relief to think the cattle don't have to take that walk any more?\"    Sam was evidently trying to turn the subject, but Yan would not be  balked. \"I heard Si call you 'Woodpecker' the other day.\"    \"Yep. I got that at school. When I was a kid to hum I heerd Ma talk  about me be-a-u-tiful _golden_ hair, but when I got big enough  to go to school I learned that it was only _red_, an' they called  me the 'Red-headed Woodpecker.' I tried to lick them, but lots of them  could lick me an' rubbed it in wuss. When I seen fightin' didn't  work, I let on to like it, but it was too late then. Mostly it's just  'Woodpecker' for short. I don't know as it ever lost me any sleep.\"    Half an hour later, as they sat by the fire that Yan made with  rubbing-sticks, he said, \"Say, Woodpecker, I want to tell you a  story.\" Sam grimaced, pulled his ears forward, and made ostentatious  preparations to listen.    \"There was once an Indian squaw taken prisoner by some other tribe way  up north. They marched her 500 miles away, but one night she escaped  and set out, not on the home trail, for she knew they would follow  that way and kill her, but to one side. She didn't know the country  and got lost. She had no weapons but a knife, and no food but berries.  Well, she travelled fast for several days till a rainstorm came, then  she felt safe, for she knew her enemies could not trail her now. But  winter was near and she could not get home before it came. So she set  to work right where she was.    \"She made a wigwam of Birch bark and a fire with rubbing-sticks, using  the lace of her moccasin for a bow-string. She made snares of the  inner bark of the Willow and of Spruce roots, and deadfalls, too, for  Rabbits. She was starving sometimes, at first, but she ate the buds  and inner bark of Birch trees till she found a place where there were  lots of Rabbits. And when she caught some she used every scrap of  them. She made a fishing-line of the sinews, and a hook of the bones  and teeth lashed together with sinew and Spruce gum.    \"She made a cloak of Rabbit skins, sewed with needles of Rabbit bone  and thread of Rabbit sinew, and a lot of dishes of Birch bark sewed  with Spruce roots.    \"She put in the whole winter there alone, and when the spring came she  was found by Samuel Hearne, the great traveller. Her precious knife  was worn down, but she was fat and happy and ready to set out for her  own people.\"    \"Well, I say that's mighty inter-est-in',\" said Sam--he had listened  attentively--\"an' I'd like nothin' better than to try it myself if I  had a gun an' there was lots of game.\"    \"Pooh, who wouldn't?\"    \"Mighty few--an' there's mighty few who _could_.\"  \"I could.\"    \"What, make everything with just a knife? I'd like to see you make  a teepee,\" then adding earnestly, \"Sam, we've been kind o' playing  Injuns; now let's do it properly. Let's make everything out of what we  find in the woods.\"    \"Guess we'll have to visit the Sanger Witch again. She knows all about  plants.\"    \"We'll be the Sanger Indians. We can both be Chiefs,\" said Yan, not  wishing to propose himself as Chief or caring to accept Sam as his  superior. \"I'm Little Beaver. Now what are you?\"    \"Bloody-Thundercloud-in-the-Afternoon.\"    \"No, try again. Make it something you can draw, so you can make your  totem, and make it short.\"    \"What's the smartest animal there is?\"    \"I--I--suppose the Wolverine.\"    \"What! Smarter'n a Fox?\"    \"The books say so.\"    \"Kin he lick a Beaver?\"    \"Well, I should say so.\"    \"Well, that's me.\"    \"No, you don't. I'm not going around with a fellow that licks me. It  don't fit you as well as 'Woodpecker,' anyhow. I always get _you_  when I want a nice tree spoiled or pecked into holes,\" retorted Yan,  magnanimously ignoring the personal reason for the name.    \"Tain t as bad as _beavering_,\" answered Sam    \"Beavering\" was a word with a history. Axes and timber were the  biggest things in the lives of the Sangerites. Skill with the axe was  the highest accomplishment. The old settlers used to make everything  in the house out of wood, and with the axe for the only tool. It was  even said that some of them used to \"edge her up a bit\" and shave with  her on Sundays. When a father was setting his son up in life he gave  him simply a good axe. The axe was the grand essential of life and  work, and was supposed to be a whole outfit. Skill with the axe was  general. Every man and boy was more or less expert, and did not know  how expert he was till a real \"greeny\" came among them. There is a  right way to cut for each kind of grain, and a certain proper way of  felling a tree to throw it in any given direction with the minimum of  labour. All these things are second nature to the Sangerite. A Beaver  is credited with a haphazard way of gnawing round and round a tree  till somehow it tumbles, and when a chopper deviates in the least from  the correct form, the exact right cut in the exact right place, he is  said to be \"beavering\"; therefore, while \"working like a Beaver\" is  high praise, \"beavering\" a tree is a term of unmeasured reproach, and  Sam's final gibe had point and force that none but a Sangerite could  possibly have appreciated.          XI    Yan and the Witch        The Sanger Witch hated the Shanty-man's axe    And wildfire, too, they tell,    But the hate that she had for the Sporting man    Was wuss nor her hate of Hell!      --Cracked Jimmie's Ballad of Sanger.      Yan took his earliest opportunity to revisit the Sanger Witch.    \"Better leave me out,\" advised Sam, when he heard of it. \"She'd never  look at you if I went. You look too blame healthy.\"    So Yan went alone, and he was glad of it. Fond as he was of Sam, his  voluble tongue and ready wit left Yan more or less in the shade, made  him look sober and dull, and what was worse, continually turned the  conversation just as it was approaching some subject that was of  deepest interest to him.    As he was leaving, Sam called out, \"Say, Yan, if you want to stay  there to dinner it'll be all right--we'll know why you hain't turned  up.\" Then he stuck his tongue in his cheek, closed one eye and went to  the barn with his usual expression of inscrutable melancholy.    Yan carried his note-book--he used it more and more, also his  sketching materials. On the road he gathered a handful of flowers and  herbs. His reception by the old woman was very different this time.    \"Come in, come in, God bless ye, an' hoo air ye, an' how is yer father  an' mother--come in an' set down, an' how is that spalpeen, Sam  Raften?\"    \"Sam's all right now,\" said Yan with a blush.    \"All right! Av coorse he's all right. I knowed I'd fix him all right,  an' he knowed it, an' his Ma knowed it when she let him come. Did she  say onything about it?\"    \"No, Granny, not a word.\"    \"The dhirty hussy! Saved the boy's life in sphite of their robbin' me  an' she ain't human enough to say 'thank ye'--the dhirty hussy!  May God forgive her as I do,\" said the old woman with evident and  implacable enmity.    \"Fwhat hev ye got thayer? Hivin be praised, they can't kill them all  off. They kin cut down the trees, but the flowers comes ivery year, me  little beauties--me little beauties!\" Yan spread them out. She picked  up an Arum and went on. \"Now, that's Sorry-plant, only some calls it  Injun Turnip, an' I hear the childer call it Jack-in-the-Pulpit. Don't  ye never put the root o' that near yer tongue. It'll sure burn ye like  fire. First thing whin they gits howld av a greeny the bhise throis to  make him boite that same. Shure he niver does it twicet. The Injuns  b'ile the pizen out o' the root an' ates it; shure it's better'n  starvin'.\"    Golden Seal (_Hydrastis canadensis_), the plant she had used for  Sam's knee, was duly recognized and praised, its wonderful golden  root, \"the best goold iver came out av the ground,\" was described with  its impression of the seal of the Wise King.    \"Thim's Mandrakes, an' they're moighty late, an' ye shure got  _thim_ in the woods. Some calls it May Apples, an' more calls it  Kingroot. The Injuns use it fur their bowels, an' it has cured many a  horse of pole evil that I seen meself.    \"An' Blue Cohosh, only I call that Spazzum-root.
