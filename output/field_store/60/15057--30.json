His  wisdom is clouded with the original sin. He lives in idleness; he  paints his face; he makes his squaw labor for him, instead of  laboring for her; he kills his brothers. He worships the trees and  rocks. If he were wise he would not make gods of the swift arrow and  bounding canoe; of the flowering ash and the flaming flint. For  these things have not life. In his dreams he sees his arrow speed to  the reeling deer; in his dreams he sees his canoe shoot over the  crest of shining waves; and in his mind he gives them life. When his  eyes are opened he will see they have no spirit. The spirit is in  his own heart. It guides the arrow to the running deer, and steers  the canoe over the swirling current. The spirit makes him find the  untrodden paths, and do brave deeds, and love his children and his  honor. It makes him meet his foe face to face, and if he is to die  it gives him strength to die--a man. The spirit is what makes him  different from the arrow, the canoe, the mountain, and all the birds  and beasts. For it is born of the Great Spirit, the creator of all.  Him you must worship.    \"Redmen, this worship is understanding your spirit and teaching it  to do good deeds. It is called Christianity. Christianity is love.  If you will love the Great Spirit you will love your wives, your  children, your brothers, your friends, your foes--you will love the  palefaces. No more will you idle in winter and wage wars in summer.  You will wear your knife and tomahawk only when you hunt for meat.  You will be kind, gentle, loving, virtuous--you will have grown  wise. When your days are done you will meet all your loved ones in  the beautiful forest. There, where the flowers bloom, the fruits  ripen always, where the pleasant water glides and the summer winds  whisper sweetly, there peace will dwell forever.    \"Comrades, be wise, think earnestly. Forget the wicked paleface; for  there are many wicked palefaces. They sell the serpent firewater;  they lie and steal and kill. These palefaces' eyes are still  clouded. If they do not open they will never see the beautiful  forest. You have much to forgive, but those who forgive please the  Great Spirit; you must give yourselves to love, but those who love  are loved; you must work, but those who work are happy.    \"Behold the Village of Peace! Once it contained few; now there are  many. Where once the dark forest shaded the land, see the cabins,  the farms, the horses, the cattle! Field on field of waving, golden  grain shine there under your eyes. The earth has blossomed  abundance. Idling and fighting made not these rich harvests. Belief  made love; love made wise eyes; wise eyes saw, and lo! there came  plenty.    \"The proof of love is happiness. These Christian Indians are happy.  They are at peace with the redman and the paleface. They till the  fields and work in the shops. In days to come cabins and farms and  fields of corn will be theirs. They will bring up their children,  not to hide in the forest to slay, but to walk hand in hand with the  palefaces as equals.    \"Oh, open your ears! God speaks to you; peace awaits you! Cast the  bitterness from your hearts; it is the serpent-poison. While you  hate, God shuts His eyes. You are great on the trail, in the  council, in war; now be great in forgiveness. Forgive the palefaces  who have robbed you of your lands. Then will come peace. If you do  not forgive, the war will go on; you will lose lands and homes, to  find unmarked graves under the forest leaves. Revenge is sweet; but  it is not wise. The price of revenge is blood and life. Root it out  of your hearts. Love these Christian Indians; love the missionaries  as they love you; love all living creatures. Your days are but few;  therefore, cease the the strife. Let us say, 'Brothers, that is  God's word, His law; that is love; that is Christianity!' If you  will say from your heart, brother, you are a Christian.    \"Brothers, the paleface teacher beseeches you. Think not of this  long, bloody war, of your dishonored dead, of your silenced wigwams,  of your nameless graves, of your homeless children. Think of the  future. One word from you will make peace over all this broad land.  The paleface must honor a Christian. He can steal no Christian's  land. All the palefaces, as many as the stars of the great white  path, dare not invade the Village of Peace. For God smiles here.  Listen to His words: 'Come unto me all that are weary and heavy  laden, and I will give you rest.'\"    Over the multitude brooded an impressive, solemn silence. Then an  aged Delaware chief rose, with a mien of profound thought, and  slowly paced before the circle of chiefs. Presently he stopped,  turned to the awaiting Indians, and spoke:    \"Netawatwees is almost persuaded to be a Christian.\" He resumed his  seat.    Another interval of penetrating quiet ensued. At length a  venerable-looking chieftain got up:    \"White Eyes hears the rumbling thunder in his ears. The smoke blows  from his eyes. White Eyes is the oldest chief of the Lenni-Lenape.  His days are many; they are full; they draw near the evening of his  life; he rejoices that wisdom is come before his sun is set.    \"White Eyes believes the young White Father. The ways of the Great  Spirit are many as the fluttering leaves; they are strange and  secret as the flight of a loon; White Eyes believes the redman's  happy hunting grounds need not be forgotten to love the palefaces'  God. As a young brave pants and puzzles over his first trail, so the  grown warrior feels in his understanding of his God. He gropes  blindly through dark ravines.    \"White Eyes speaks few words to-day, for he is learning wisdom; he  bids his people hearken to the voice of the White Father. War is  wrong; peace is best. Love is the way to peace. The paleface  advances one step nearer his God. He labors for his home; he keeps  the peace; he asks but little; he frees his women. That is well.  White Eyes has spoken.\"    The old chief slowly advanced toward the Christian Indians. He laid  aside his knife and tomahawk, and then his eagle plumes and  war-bonnet. Bareheaded, he seated himself among the converted  redmen. They began chanting in low, murmuring tones.    Amid the breathless silence that followed this act of such great  significance, Wingenund advanced toward the knoll with slow, stately  step. His dark eye swept the glade with lightning scorn; his glance  alone revealed the passion that swayed him.    \"Wingenund's ears are keen; they have heard a feather fall in the  storm; now they hear a soft-voiced thrush. Wingenund thunders to his  people, to his friends, to the chiefs of other tribes: 'Do not bury  the hatchet!' The young White Father's tongue runs smooth like the  gliding brook; it sings as the thrush calls its mate. Listen; but  wait, wait! Let time prove his beautiful tale; let the moons go by  over the Village of Peace.    \"Wingenund does not flaunt his wisdom. He has grown old among his  warriors; he loves them; he fears for them. The dream of the  palefaces' beautiful forest glimmers as the rainbow glows over the  laughing falls of the river. The dream of the paleface is too  beautiful to come true. In the days of long ago, when Wingenund's  forefathers heard not the paleface's ax, they lived in love and  happiness such as the young White Father dreams may come again. They  waged no wars. A white dove sat in every wigwam. The lands were  theirs and they were rich. The paleface came with his leaden death,  his burning firewater, his ringing ax, and the glory of the redmen  faded forever.    \"Wingenund seeks not to inflame his braves to anger. He is sick of  blood-spilling--not from fear; for Wingenund cannot feel fear. But  he asks his people to wait. Remember, the gifts of the paleface ever  contained a poisoned arrow. Wingenund's heart is sore. The day of  the redman is gone. His sun is setting. Wingenund feels already the  gray shades of evening.\"    He stopped one long moment as if to gather breath for his final  charge to his listeners. Then with a magnificent gesture he  thundered:    \"Is the Delaware a fool? When Wingenund can cross unarmed to the Big  Water he shall change his mind. When Deathwind ceases to blow his  bloody trail over the fallen leaves Wingenund will believe.\"        Chapter XIII.    As the summer waned, each succeeding day, with its melancholy calm,  its changing lights and shades, its cool, damp evening winds,  growing more and more suggestive of autumn, the little colony of  white people in the Village of Peace led busy, eventful lives.    Upwards of fifty Indians, several of them important chiefs, had  become converted since the young missionary began preaching.  Heckewelder declared that this was a wonderful showing, and if it  could be kept up would result in gaining a hold on the Indian tribes  which might not be shaken. Heckewelder had succeeded in interesting  the savages west of the Village of Peace to the extent of permitting  him to establish missionary posts in two other localities--one near  Goshhocking, a Delaware town; and one on the Muskingong, the  principal river running through central Ohio. He had, with his  helpers, Young and Edwards, journeyed from time to time to these  points, preaching, making gifts, and soliciting help from chiefs.    The most interesting feature, perhaps, of the varied life of the  missionary party was a rivalry between Young and Edwards for the  elder Miss Wells. Usually Nell's attractiveness appealed more to men  than Kate's; however, in this instance, although the sober teachers  of the gospel admired Nell's winsome beauty, they fell in love with  Kate. The missionaries were both under forty, and good, honest men,  devoted to the work which had engrossed them for years. Although  they were ardent lovers, certainly"]]]
