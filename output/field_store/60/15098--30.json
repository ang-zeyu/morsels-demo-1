Beethoven, who was informed of this  scandal from various quarters, appealed vigorously to his brother, in the  hope of persuading him to separate from his ill-conducted wife, but failed  in his attempt, owing to the indolence of this ill-regulated man.\" It was  Schindler, too, who prevented Beethoven making any further application to  the police. The following note probably refers to this. In his note-book of  November, 1823, is a Canon written by Beethoven on his brother Johann and  his family, on these words, \"Fettluemerl Bankert haben triumphirt,\" no doubt  an allusion to the disgraceful incident we have mentioned. Brother Johann's  wife had a very lovely daughter before she married him.]      360.    TO SCHINDLER.    WISEACRE! I kiss the hem of your garment!      361.    TO HERR GRILLPARZER, COURT COMPOSER.    ESTEEMED SIR,--    The directors wish to know your terms with regard to \"Melusina.\" [See No.  331.] In so far she has asserted herself, which is certainly better than  being obliged to importune others on such matters. My household has been in  great disorder for some time past, otherwise I should have called on you,  and requested you to visit me in return.[1] Pray, write your conditions at  once, either to the directors or to myself, in which case I will undertake  to deliver them. I have been so busy that I could not call on you, nor can  I do so now, but hope to see you before long. My number is 323.    In the afternoons you will find me in the coffee-house opposite the  \"Goldene Birne.\" If you do come, I beg that you may be _alone_. That  obtrusive appendage, Schindler, has long been most obnoxious to me, as you  must have perceived when at Hetzendorf,[2] _otium est vitium_. I embrace  and esteem you from my heart.    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: In the note-book of 1823 is written, in Beethoven's hand:      8th or 9th November, bad humor.    Another bad day.    Another bad day.    And underneath, in Schindler's hand:      Devil take such a life!]    [Footnote 2: The _Elegante Zeitung_ of 1858, No. 73, relates the following  anecdote about this visit:--\"During the composition of the Opera many  conferences took place between the two artistic colleagues, when the new  work was zealously discussed on both sides. On one occasion the poet drove  out to visit the composer in the country. Beethoven's writing-desk was  placed somewhat like a sentry-box opposite a cupboard for provisions, the  contents of which compelled the housekeeper to be perpetually coming and  going, attracting thereby many an admonitory look askance in the midst of  his conversation from the deaf _maestro_. At last the clock struck the  dinner-hour. Beethoven went down to his cellar, and soon after returned  carrying four bottles of wine, two of which he placed beside the poet,  while the other two were allotted to the composer himself and a third  guest. After dinner Beethoven slipped out of the room, and held a short  parley with the coachman hired for the occasion, who was still waiting at  the door. When the time arrived for returning to town, Beethoven proposed  driving part of the way with his guests, and did not get out of the  carriage till close to the Burgthor. Scarcely was he gone when the  companions he had just quitted found some papers lying on the seat he had  vacated, which proved to be six _gulden_, the amount of the carriage-hire.  They instantly stopped the carriage, and shouted to their friend (who was  making off as quick as he could) that he had forgotten some money; but  Beethoven did not stand still till he was at a safe distance, when he waved  his hat, rejoicing with the glee of a child at the success of his trick.  There was no possibility of refusing his _naif_ generosity, and they had  sufficient delicacy of feeling not to poison his enjoyment by any untimely  remonstrances.\"]      362.    TO PROBST, MUSIC PUBLISHER,--LEIPZIG.    Vienna, March 10, 1824.    ... These are all I can at present give you for publication. I must, alas!  now speak of myself, and say that this, the greatest work I have ever  written, is well worth 1000 florins C.M. It is a new grand symphony, with a  finale and voice parts introduced, solo and choruses, the words being those  of Schiller's immortal \"Ode to Joy,\" in the style of my pianoforte Choral  Fantasia, only of much greater breadth. The price is 600 florins C.M. One  condition is, indeed, attached to this Symphony, that it is not to appear  till next year, July, 1825; but to compensate for this long delay, I will  give you a pianoforte arrangement of the work gratis, and in more important  engagements you shall always find me ready to oblige you.      363.    TO SCHINDLER.    1824.    Frau S. [Schnaps] will provide what is required, so come to dinner to-day  at two o'clock. I have good news to tell you,[1] but this is quite _entre  nous_, for the _braineater_ [his brother Johann] must know nothing about  it.    [Footnote 1: This no doubt refers to a letter from Prince Gallizin, March  11, 1824:--\"I beg you will be so good as to let me know when I may expect  the Quartet, which I await with the utmost impatience. If you require  money, I request you will draw on Messrs. Stieglitz & Co., in St.  Petersburg, for the sum you wish to have, and it will be paid to your  order.\"]      364.    TO HERR V. RZEHATSCHEK.    1824.    MY WORTHY HERR V. RZEHATSCHEK,--    Schuppanzigh assures me that you intend to be so kind as to lend me the  instruments required for my concert;[1] thus encouraged, I venture to ask  you to do so, and hope not to meet with a refusal when thus earnestly  soliciting you to comply with my request.    Your obedient servant,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: It seems highly probable that this concert is the celebrated  one in the spring of 1824, when the Ninth Symphony and a portion of the  Grand Mass were performed.]      365.    TO THE HIGH CHAMBERLAIN PRINCE TRAUTMANNSDORF.[1]    I am deeply indebted to your Highness for your invariable politeness, which  I prize probably the more from Y.H. being by no means devoid of sympathy  for my art. I hope one day to have the opportunity of proving my esteem for  your H.    [Footnote 1: Enclosed in a note to Schindler, who was to apply for the  great _Redoutensaal_ for the concert on April 8, 1824.]      366.    TO COUNT MORITZ LICHNOWSKY.[1]    Insincerity I despise; visit me no more; my concert is not to take place.    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The originals of these three well-known notes were found by  Schindler on the piano, where Beethoven usually left things of the kind,  which he intended his amanuensis to take charge of. Lichnowsky,  Schuppanzigh, and Schindler had all met at Beethoven's, as if by chance, in  order to discuss with him some difficulties which stood in the way of the  concert. The suspicious _maestro_ saw only collusion and treachery in this,  and wrote these notes, which Schindler did not allow to be sent.]      367.    TO HERR SCHUPPANZIGH.    Come no more to see me. I give no concert.    BEETHOVEN.      368.    TO HERR SCHINDLER.    Do not come to me till I summon you. No concert.    BEETHOVEN.      369.    TO HERR V. SARTORIUS, ROYAL CENSOR.    SIR,--    As I hear that obstacles are likely to arise on the part of the royal  censorship to a portion of sacred music being given at an evening concert  in the Theatre \"an der Wien,\" I must inform you that I have been  particularly requested to give these pieces, that the copies for this  purpose have already caused serious expense, and the intervening time is  too short to produce other new works. Besides, only three sacred  compositions are to be given, and these under the title of hymns. I do  earnestly entreat you, sir, to interest yourself in this matter, as there  are always so many difficulties to contend with on similar occasions.  Should this permission not be granted, I do assure you that it will be  impossible to give a concert at all, and the whole outlay expended on the  copying be thrown away. I hope you have not quite forgotten me.    I am, sir, with high consideration, yours,    BEETHOVEN.      370.    TO SCHINDLER.    1824.    If you have any information to give me, pray write it down; but seal the  note, for which purpose you will find wax and a seal on my table. Let me  know where Duport[1] lives, when he is usually to be met with, and whether  I could see him alone, or if it is probable that people will be there, and  who?    I feel far from well. _Portez-vous bien._ I am still hesitating whether to  speak to Duport or to write to him, which I cannot do without bitterness.    Do not wait dinner for me; I hope you will enjoy it. I do not intend to  come, being ill from our bad fare of yesterday. A flask of wine is ready  for you.    [Footnote 1: Schindler says that on April 24, 1824, he applied to Duport,  at that time administrator of the Kaernthnerthor Theatre, in Beethoven's  name, to sanction his giving a grand concert there, allowing him to have  the use of the house for the sum of 400 florins C.M. Further, that the  conducting of the concert should be intrusted to Umlauf and Schuppanzigh,  and the solos to Mesdames Unger and Sonntag, and to the bass singer  Preisinger.]      371.[1]    TO SCHINDLER.    I beg you will come to see me to-morrow, as I have a tale to tell you as  sour as vinegar. Duport said yesterday that he had written to me, though I  have not yet got his letter, but he expressed his satisfaction, which is  best of all. The chief feat however is not yet performed, that which is to  be acted in front of the _Proscenium_!    [In Beethoven's writing:] Yours, _from C# below to high F_,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Written by his nephew.]      372.    TO SCHINDLER.    After six weeks of discussion, here, there, and everywhere, I am fairly  boiled, stewed, and roasted.

Felix again  embraced Weber, and then challenged his new friend, Mr. Benedict, to  race him to the door of his house. On entering he dragged the visitor  upstairs to the drawing-room, exclaiming, \"Mama, Mama, here is a  gentleman, a pupil of Carl Weber, who knows all about the new opera,  'Der Freischuetz.'\"    The young musician received a warm welcome, and was not able to leave  until he had played on the piano all the airs he could remember  from the wonderful new opera, which Weber had come to Berlin to  superintend. Benedict was so pleased with his first visit that he came  again. This time he found Felix writing music and asked what it was.  \"I am finishing my new quartet for piano and strings,\" was the simple  reply. To say that Benedict was surprised at such an answer from a boy  of twelve hardly expresses what he felt. It was quite true he did not  yet know Felix Mendelssohn. \"And now,\" said the boy, laying down his  pen, \"I will play to you, to prove how grateful I am that you played  to us last time.\" He then sat down at the piano and played correctly  several melodies from \"Der Freischuetz,\" which Benedict had played on  his first visit. After that they went into the garden, and Felix for  the moment, became a rollicking boy, jumping fences and climbing trees  like a squirrel.    Toward the close of this year, 1821, his teacher Zelter announced he  intended going to Wiemar, to see Goethe, the aged poet of Wiemar, and  was willing to take Felix with him. The poet's house at Wiemar was  indeed a shrine to the elect, and the chance of meeting the object  of so much hero worship, filled the impressionable mind of Felix with  reverential awe. Zelter on his part, felt a certain pride in bringing  his favorite pupil to the notice of the great man, though he would not  have permitted Felix to guess what he felt for anything he possessed.    When they arrived, Goethe was walking in his garden. He greeted both  with kindness and affection, and it was arranged that Felix should  play for him next day. Zelter had told Goethe much about his pupil's  unusual talents, but the poet wished to prove these accounts by his  own tests. Selecting piece after piece of manuscript music from his  collection, he asked the boy to play them at sight. He was able to do  so with ease, to the astonishment of the friends who had come in to  hear him. They were more delighted when he took a theme from one of  the pieces and improvised upon it. Withholding his praise, Goethe  announced he had a final test, and placed on the music desk a sheet  which seemed covered with mere scratches and blotches. The boy  laughingly exclaimed, \"Who could ever read such writing as that?\"  Zelter rose and came to the piano to look at this curiosity. \"Why, it  is Beethoven's writing; one can see that a mile off! He always wrote  as if he used a broomstick for a pen, then wiped his sleeve over the  wet ink!\"    The boy picked out the strange manuscript bit by bit; when he came to  the end he cried, \"Now I will play it through for you,\" which he did  without a mistake. Goethe was well pleased and begged Felix to come  every day and play, while he was in the city. The two became fast  friends; the poet treated him as a son, and at parting begged he would  soon return to Wiemar, that they might again be together. During the  following summer the whole family made a tour through Switzerland,  much to the delight of Felix, who enjoyed every moment. There was  little time for real work in composition, but a couple of songs and  the beginning of a piano quartet were inspired by the view of Lake  Geneva and its exquisite surroundings.    When Felix returned to Berlin, he had grown much, physically as well  as mentally. He was now tall and strong, his curling locks had been  clipped, and he seemed at a single bound to have become almost a man.  His happy, boyish spirits, however, had not changed in the least.  About this time the family removed from their home on the Neue  Promenade, to a larger and more stately mansion, No. 3 Leipsiger  Strasse, then situated on the outskirts of the town, near the Potsdam  Gate. As those who know the modern city realize, this house, now no  longer a private residence, stands in the very heart of traffic and  business. The rooms of the new home were large and elegant, with  a spacious salon suitable for musicals and large functions. A fine  garden or park belonged to the house, where were lawns shaded by  forest trees, winding paths, flowering shrubs and arbors in shady  nooks, offering quiet retreats. Best of all there was a garden house,  with a central hall, which would hold several hundred people, having  long windows and glass doors looking out upon the trees and flowers.  Sunday concerts were soon resumed and given in the garden house,  where, on week days the young people met, with friends and elders, to  play, and act and enjoy the social life of the home. The mansion and  its hospitality became famous, and every great musician, at one time  or another, came to pay his respects and become acquainted with this  art-loving family.    At a family party in honor of Felix's fifteenth birthday, his teacher  Zelter saluted him as no longer an apprentice, but as an \"assistant\"  and member of the Brotherhood of Art. Very soon after this the young  composer completed two important works. The first was an Octet for  strings. He was not yet seventeen when the Octet was finished,  which was pronounced the most fresh and original work he had yet  accomplished. It marked a distinct stage in the gifted youth's  development. The composition which followed was the beautiful  \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" music. He and his sister Fanny had lately  made the acquaintance of Shakespeare through a German translation, and  had been fascinated by this fairy play. The young people spent much of  their time in the lovely garden that summer, and amid these delightful  surroundings the music was conceived.    The Overture was first to spring into being. When it was written  out, Felix and Fanny often played it as a duet. In this form the  composer-pianist Moscheles heard it and was impressed by its beauty.  The fascinating Scherzo and dreamy Nocturne followed. When all were  elaborated and perfected, the complete work was performed by the  garden house orchestra for a crowded audience, who abundantly  expressed their delight. Sir G. Macfarren has said of it: \"No one  musical work contains so many points of harmony and orchestration that  are novel yet none of them have the air of experiment, but all seem to  have been written with a certainty of their success.\"    And now a great plan occupied Mendelssohn's mind, a project which had  been forming for some time; this was nothing less than to do something  to arouse people to know and appreciate the great works of Johann  Sebastian Bach. Two years before Felix had been presented with a  manuscript score of Bach's \"Passion according to St. Matthew,\" which  Zelter had allowed to be copied from the manuscript preserved in the  Singakademie. The old man was a devoted lover of Bach's music, and  had taught his pupil in the same spirit. When Felix found himself the  possessor of this wonderful book, he set to work to master it, until  he knew every bit of it by heart. As he studied it deeply he was more  and more impressed with its beauty and sublimity. He could hardly  believe that this great work was unknown throughout Germany, since  more than a hundred years had passed since it had been written. He  determined to do something to arouse people from such apathy.    Talking the matter over with musicians and friends, he began to  interest them in the plan to study the music of the Passion. Soon  he had secured sixteen good voices, who rehearsed at his home once  a week. His enthusiasm fired them to study the music seriously, and  before very long they were anxious to give a public performance.  There was a splendid choir of nearly four hundred voices conducted by  Zelter, at the Singakademie; if he would only lend his chorus to give  a trial performance, under Mendelssohn's conducting, how splendid that  would be! But Felix knew that Zelter had no faith in the public taking  any interest in Bach, so there was no use asking. This opinion was  opposed by one of his little choir, named Devrient, who insisted that  Zelter should be approached on the subject. As he himself had been  a pupil of Zelter, he persuaded Mendelssohn to accompany him to the  director's house.    Zelter was found seated at his instrument, enveloped by a cloud of  smoke from a long stemmed pipe. Devrient unfolded the plan of bringing  this great work of Bach to the knowledge of the public. The old man  listened to their plea with growing impatience, until he became quite  excited, rose from his chair and paced the floor with great strides,  exclaiming, \"No, it is not to be thought of--it is a mad scheme.\" To  Felix argument then seemed useless and he beckoned his friend to  come away, but Devrient refused to move, and kept up his persuasive  argument. Finally, as though a miracle had been wrought, Zelter began  to weaken, and at last gave in, and besides promised all the aid in  his power.    How this youth, not yet twenty, undertook the great task of preparing  this masterpiece, and what he accomplished is little short of the  marvelous. The public performance, conducted by Mendelssohn, took  place March 11, 1829, with every ticket sold and more than a thousand  persons turned away. A second performance was given on March 21, the  anniversary of Bach's birth, before a packed house. These performances  marked the beginning of a great Bach revival in Germany and England,  and the love for this music has never been lost, but increases each  year.    And now"]]]
