This parasite plant  (the seed splitting without cotyledons), protrudes a spiral body, and not  endeavouring to root itself in the earth ascends the vegetables in its  vicinity, spirally W.S.E. or contrary to the movement of the sun;  and absorbs its nourishment by vessels apparently inserted into its  supporters. It bears no leaves, except here and there a scale, very  small, membranous, and close under the branch. Lin. Spec. Plant. edit. a  Reichard. Vol. I. p. 352. The Rev. T. Martyn, in his elegant letters on  botany, adds, that, not content with support, where it lays hold, there  it draws its nourishment; and at length, in gratitude for all this,  strangles its entertainer. Let. xv. A contest for air and light obtains  throughout the whole vegetable world; shrubs rise above herbs; and, by  precluding the air and light from them, injure or destroy them; trees  suffocate or incommode shrubs; the parasite climbing plants, as Ivy,  Clematis, incommode the taller trees; and other parasites, which exist  without having roots on the ground, as Misletoe, Tillandsia, Epidendrum,  and the mosses and funguses, incommode them all.    Some of the plants with voluble stems ascend other plants spirally  east-south-west, as Humulus, Hop, Lonicera, Honey-suckle, Tamus,  black Bryony, Helxine. Others turn their spiral stems west-south-east, as  Convolvulus, Corn-bind, Phaseolus, Kidney-bean, Basella, Cynanche,  Euphorbia, Eupatorium. The proximate or final causes of this difference  have not been investigated. Other plants are furnished with tendrils for  the purpose of climbing: if the tendril meets with nothing to lay hold of  in its first revolution, it makes another revolution; and so on till it  wraps itself quite up like a cork-screw; hence, to a careless observer,  it appears to move gradually backwards and forwards, being seen sometimes  pointing eastward and sometimes westward. One of the Indian grasses,  Panicum arborescens, whose stem is no thicker than a goose-quill, rises  as high as the tallest trees in this contest for light and air. Spec.  Plant a Reichard, Vol. I. p. 161. The tops of many climbing plants are  tender from their quick growth; and, when deprived of their acrimony by  boiling, are an agreeable article of food. The Hop-tops are in common  use. I have eaten the tops of white Bryony, Bryonia alba, and found them  nearly as grateful as Asparagus, and think this plant might be profitably  cultivated as an early garden-vegetable. The Tamus (called black Bryony),  was less agreeable to the taste when boiled.

The chemical process of fermentation converts this sugar into  spirit, converts food into poison! And it has thus become the curse of  the Christian world, producing more than half of our chronical diseases;  which Mahomet observed, and forbade the use of it to his disciples. The  Arabians invented distillation; and thus, by obtaining the spirit of  fermented liquors in a less diluted slate, added to its destructive  quality. A Theory of the Diabaetes and Dropsy, produced by drinking  fermented or spirituous liquors, is explained in a Treatise on the  inverted motions of the lymphatic system, published by Dr. Darwin.

The antient story of Prometheus, who concealed  in his bosom the fire he had stolen, and afterwards had a vulture  perpetually gnawing his liver, affords so apt an allegory for the effects  of drinking spirituous liquors, that one should be induced to think the  art of distillation, as well as some other chemical processes (such as  calcining gold), had been known in times of great antiquity, and lost  again. The swallowing drams cannot be better represented in hieroglyphic  language than by taking fire into one's bosom; and certain it is, that  the general effect of drinking fermented or spirituous liquors is an  inflamed, schirrous, or paralytic liver, with its various critical or  consequential diseases, as leprous eruptions on the face, gout, dropsy,  epilepsy, insanity. It is remarkable, that all the diseases from drinking  spirituous or fermented liquors are liable to become hereditary, even to  the third generation; gradually increasing, if the cause be continued,  till the family becomes extinct.]              The gentle CYCLAMEN with dewy eye  380  Breathes o'er her lifeless babe the parting sigh;          And, bending low to earth, with pious hands          Inhumes her dear Departed in the sands.          \"Sweet Nursling! withering in thy tender hour,          \"Oh, sleep,\" She cries, \"and rise a fairer flower!\"  385   --So when the Plague o'er London's gasping crowds          Shook her dank wing, and steer'd her murky clouds;          When o'er the friendless bier no rites were read,          No dirge slow-chanted, and no pall out-spread;          While Death and Night piled up the naked throng,  390  And Silence drove their ebon cars along;          Six lovely daughters, and their father, swept          To the throng'd grave CLEONE saw, and wept;      [_Cyclamen_. 1. 379.

As  soon as the time for its approach drew nigh, Mahomet sent two scouts to  Hama, north of Medina, who were to bring tidings to him the moment they  caught sight of its advancing dust. But Abu Sofian had been warned of  Mahomet's activity and turned off swiftly to the coast, keeping the  seaward route, while he sent a messenger to Mecca with the news that an  attack by the Muslim was meditated.    Dhamdham, sent by his anxious leader, arrived in the city after three  days' journey in desperate haste across the desert, and flung himself  from his camel before the Kaaba. There he beat the camel to its knees,  cut off its ears and nose, and put the saddle hind foremost. Then,  rending his garments, he cried with a loud voice:    \"Help, O Kureisch, your caravan is pursued by Mahomet!\"    With one accord the Meccan warriors, angered by the news that spread  wildly among the populace, assembled before their holy place and swore a  great oath that they would uphold their dignity and avenge their loss  upon the upstart followers of a demented leader. Every man who could bear  arms prepared in haste for the expedition, and those who could not fight  found young men as their representatives. In the midst of all the tumult  and eager resolutions to exterminate the Muslim, so runs the tale, there  were few who would listen to Atikah, the daughter of Abd-al-Muttalib.    \"I have dreamed three nights ago, that the Kureisch will be called to  arms in three days and will perish. Behold the fulfilment of my dream!  Woe to the Kureisch, for their slaughter is foretold!\"    But she was treated as of no account, a woman and frail, and the army set  out upon its expedition in all the bravery of that pomp-loving nation.    With Abu Jahl at its head, and accompanied by slave girls with lutes and  tabrets, who were to gladden the eyes and minister to the pleasure of its  warriors, the Kureisch army moved on through the desert towards its  destined goal; but we are told by a recorder, \"dreams of disaster  accompanied it, nor was its sleep tranquil for the evil portents that  appeared therein.\" Thus, apprehensive but dauntless, the Meccan army  advanced to Safra, one day's march from Bedr, where it encountered  messengers from Abu Sofian, who announced that the caravan had eluded the  Muslim and was safe.    Then arose a debate among the Kureisch as to their next course. Many  desired to return to Mecca, deeming their purpose accomplished now that  the caravan was secure from attack, but the bolder amongst them were  anxious to advance, and the more deliberative favoured this also, because  by so doing they might hope to overawe Mahomet into quietude. But before  all there was the safety of their homes to consider, and they were  fearful lest an attack by a hostile tribe, the Beni Bekr, might be made  upon Mecca in the absence of its fighting men. Upon receiving assurances  of good faith from a tribe friendly to both, they dismissed that fear and  resolved to advance, so that they might compel Mahomet to abandon his  attacks upon their merchandise.    This proceeding seemed a reasonable and politic measure, until it was  viewed in the light of its consequences, and indeed, judging from  ordinary calculation, such a host could have no other effect than a  complete rout upon such a small and inefficient band as Mahomet's  followers. Therefore, in estimating, if they did at all carefully, the  forces matched against them, the Kureisch found themselves materially  invincible, though they had not reckoned the spiritual factor of  enthusiasm which transcended their own physical superiority.    These events had taken over nine days, and meanwhile Mahomet had not been  idle. His two spies had brought news of the approach of the caravan, but  beyond that meagre information he knew nothing. The Kureischite activity  thereafter was swallowed up in the vastnesses of the desert, which drew a  curtain as effective as death around the opposing armies.    But news of the caravan's advance was sufficient for the Prophet. With  the greatest possible speed he collected his army--not, we are told,  without some opposition from the fearful among the Medinan population,  who were anxious to avoid any act which might bring down upon them the  ruthless Meccan hosts. Legend has counted as her own this gathering  together of the Muslim before Bedr, and translating the engendered  enthusiasm into imaginative fact, has woven a pattern of barbaric  colours, wherein deeds are transformed by the spirit which prompts them.  The heroes panted for martyrdom, and each craved to be among the first to  pour forth his blood in the sacred cause. They crowded to battle on  camels and on foot. Abu Bekr in his zeal walked every step of the way,  which he regarded as the road to supreme benediction. Mahomet himself led  his valorous band, mounted on a camel with Ali by his side, having before  him two black flags borne by standard-bearers whose strength and bravery  were the envy of the rest. He possessed only seventy camels and two  horses, and the riders were chosen by lot. Behind marched or rode the  flower of Islam's warriors and statesmen--Abu Bekr, Omar, Hamza, and  Zeid, whose names already resounded through Islam for valiant deeds;  Abdallah, with Mahomet's chosen leaders of expeditions; the rank and  file, three hundred strong, regardless of what perils might overtake  them, intent on plunder and the upholding of their vigorous faith,  sallied forth from Medina as soon as they could be equipped, and took the  direct road to Mecca. On reaching Safra, for reasons we are not told,  they turned west to Bedr, a halting-place on the Syrian road, possibly  hoping to catch the caravan on its journey westwards towards the sea.    But Abu Sofian was too quick for them. Mahomet's scouts had only reached  Bedr, reconnoitered and retired, when Abu Sofian approached the well  within its precincts and demanded of a man belonging to a neighbouring  tribe if there were strangers in the vicinity.    \"I have seen none but two men, O Chief,\" he replied; \"they came to the  well to water their camels.\"    But he had been bribed by Mahomet, and knew well they were Muslim.    Abu Sofian was silent, and looked around him carefully. Suddenly he  started up as he caught sight of their camels' litter, wherein were  visible the small date stones peculiar to Medinan palms.    \"Camels from Yathreb!\" he cried quickly; \"these be the scouts of  Mahomet.\" Then he gathered his company together and departed hastily  towards the sea. He despatched a messenger to Mecca to tell of the  caravan's safety, and a little later heard with joy of his countrymen's  progress to oppose Mahomet.    \"Doth Mahomet indeed imagine that it will be this time as in the affair  of the Hadramate (slain at Nakhla)? Never! He shall know that it is  otherwise!\"    But the army that caused such joy to Abu Sofian created nothing but  apprehension in Mahomet's camp. He knew the caravan had eluded him, and  now there was a greater force more than three times his own advancing on  him. Hurriedly he convened a council of war, whereat his whole following  urged an immediate advance. The excitement had now fully captured their  tumultuous souls, and there was more danger for Mahomet in a retreat than  in an attack. An immediate advance was therefore decided upon, and  Mahomet sent Ali, on the day before the battle, to reconnoitre, as they  were nearing Bedr. The same journey which told Abu Sofian of the  presence of the Muslim also resulted for them in the capture of three  water-carriers by Ali, who dragged them before Mahomet, where they were  compelled to give the information he wanted, and from them he learned the  disposition and strength of the enemy.    The valley of Bedr is a plain, with hills flanking it to the north and  east. On the west are small sandy hillocks which render progress  difficult, especially if the ground is at all damp from recent rains.  Through this shallow valley runs the little stream, having at its  south-western extremity the springs and wells which give the place its  importance as a halting stage. Command of the wells was of the highest  importance, but as yet neither army had obtained it, for the Muslim had  not taken up their final position, and the Kureisch were hemmed in by the  sandy ground in front of them.    The wretched water-carriers being brought before Mahomet at first  declared they knew nothing, but after some time confessed they were Abu  Jahl's servants.    \"And where is the abiding place of Abu Jahl?\"    \"Beyond the sand-hills to the east.\"    \"And how many of his countrymen abide with him?\"    \"They are numerous; I cannot tell; they are as numerous as leaves.\"    \"On one day nine, the next ten.\"    \"Then they number 950 men,\" exclaimed the Prophet to Ali; \"take the men  away.\"    Mahomet now called a council of generals, and it was decided to advance  up the valley to the farther side of the wells, so as to secure the  water-supply, and destroy all except the one they themselves needed. This  manoeuvre was carried out successfully, and the Muslim army encamped  opposite the Kureisch, at the foot of the western hills and separated  from their adversaries by the low sandy hillocks in front of them. A  rough hut of palm branches was built for Mahomet whence he could direct  the battle, and where he could retire for counsel with Abu Bekr, and for  prayer.    Both sides had now made their dispositions, and there remained nothing  but to wait till daybreak. That night the rain descended upon the doomed  Kureisch like the spears of the Lord, whelming their sandy soil and  churning up the rising ground in front of the troops into a quagmire of  bottomless mud. The clouds were tempered towards the higher Muslim  position, and the water drained off the hilly land.    \"See, the Lord is with us; he has sent his heavy rain upon our enemies,\"  declared Mahomet, looking from his hut in the"]]]
