If you didn't make the move  that you saw in the crystal things got very bad in it, everything  horribly mixed and moving about rapidly, and scowling and making the  same move over and over again, and the crystal getting cloudier and  cloudier; it was best to take one's eyes away from it then, or one  dreamt about it afterwards, and the foul little pieces came and cursed  you in your sleep and moved about all night with their crooked moves.    I thought then that, drunk though he was, he was not telling the  truth, and I promised to show him to people who played chess all their  lives so that he and his mates could get a pound whenever they liked,  and I promised not to reveal his secret even to Stavlokratz, if only  he would tell me all the truth; and this promise I have kept till long  after the three sailors have lost their secret. I told him straight  out that I did not believe in the crystal. Well, Jim Bunion leaned  forward then, even further across the table, and swore he had seen the  man from whom Bill had bought the crystal and that he was one to whom  anything was possible. To begin with his hair was villainously dark,  and his features were unmistakable even down there in the South, and  he could play chess with his eyes shut, and even then he could beat  anyone in Cuba. But there was more than this, there was the bargain he  made with Bill that told one who he was. He sold that crystal for Bill  Snyth's soul.    Jim Bunion leaning over the table with his breath in my face nodded  his head several times and was silent.    I began to question him then. Did they play chess as far away as Cuba?  He said they all did. Was it conceivable that any man would make such  a bargain as Snyth made? Wasn't the trick well known? Wasn't it in  hundreds of books? And if he couldn't read books mustn't he have heard  from sailors that it is the Devil's commonest dodge to get souls from  silly people?    Jim Bunion had leant back in his own chair quietly smiling at my  questions but when I mentioned silly people he leaned forward again,  and thrust his face close to mine and asked me several times if I  called Bill Snyth silly. It seemed that these three sailors thought a  great deal of Bill Snyth and it made Jim Bunion angry to hear anything  said against him. I hastened to say that the bargain seemed silly  though not of course the man who made it; for the sailor was almost  threatening, and no wonder for the whiskey in that dim tavern would  madden a nun.    When I said that the bargain seemed silly he smiled again, and then he  thundered his fist down on the table and said that no one had ever yet  got the best of Bill Snyth and that that was the worst bargain for  himself that the Devil ever made, and that from all he had read or  heard of the Devil he had never been so badly had before as the night  when he met Bill Snyth at the inn in the thunderstorm in Cuba, for  Bill Snyth already had the damndest soul at sea; Bill was a good  fellow, but his soul was damned right enough, so he got the crystal  for nothing.    Yes, he was there and saw it all himself, Bill Snyth in the Spanish  inn and the candles flaring, and the Devil walking in and out of the  rain, and then the bargain between those two old hands, and the Devil  going out into the lightning, and the thunderstorm raging on, and Bill  Snyth sitting chuckling to himself between the bursts of the thunder.    But I had more questions to ask and interrupted this reminiscence. Why  did they all three always play together? And a look of something like  fear came over Jim Bunion's face; and at first he would not speak. And  then he said to me that it was like this; they had not paid for that  crystal, but got it as their share of Bill Snyth's kit. If they had  paid for it or given something in exchange to Bill Snyth that would  have been all right, but they couldn't do that now because Bill was  dead, and they were not sure if the old bargain might not hold good.  And Hell must be a large and lonely place, and to go there alone must  be bad, and so the three agreed that they would all stick together,  and use the crystal all three or not at all, unless one died, and then  the two would use it and the one that was gone would wait for them.  And the last of the three to go would take the crystal with him, or  maybe the crystal would bring him. They didn't think, they said, they  were the kind of men for Heaven, and he hoped they knew their place  better than that, but they didn't fancy the notion of Hell alone, if  Hell it had to be. It was all right for Bill Snyth, he was afraid of  nothing. He had known perhaps five men that were not afraid of death,  but Bill Snyth was not afraid of Hell. He died with a smile on his  face like a child in its sleep; it was drink killed poor Bill Snyth.    This was why I had beaten Bill Sloggs; Sloggs had the crystal on him  while we played, but would not use it; these sailors seemed to fear  loneliness as some people fear being hurt; he was the only one of the  three who could play chess at all, he had learnt it in order to be  able to answer questions and keep up their pretence, but he had learnt  it badly, as I found. I never saw the crystal, they never showed it to  anyone; but Jim Bunion told me that night that it was about the size  that the thick end of a hen's egg would be if it were round. And then  he fell asleep.    There were many more questions that I would have asked him but I could  not wake him up. I even pulled the table away so that he fell to the  floor, but he slept on, and all the tavern was dark but for one candle  burning; and it was then that I noticed for the first time that the  other two sailors had gone, no one remained at all but Jim Bunion and  I and the sinister barman of that curious inn, and he too was asleep.    When I saw that it was impossible to wake the sailor I went out into  the night. Next day Jim Bunion would talk of it no more; and when I  went back to Stavlokratz I found him already putting on paper his  theory about the sailors, which became accepted by chess-players, that  one of them had been taught their curious gambit and that the other  two between them had learnt all the defensive openings as well as  general play. Though who taught them no one could say, in spite of  enquiries made afterwards all along the Southern Pacific.    I never learnt any more details from any of the three sailors, they  were always too drunk to speak or else not drunk enough to be  communicative. I seem just to have taken Jim Bunion at the flood. But  I kept my promise, it was I that introduced them to the Tournament,  and a pretty mess they made of established reputations. And so they  kept on for months, never losing a game and always playing for their  pound a side. I used to follow them wherever they went merely to watch  their play. They were more marvellous than Stavlokratz even in his  youth.    But then they took to liberties such as giving their queen when  playing first-class players. And in the end one day when all three  were drunk they played the best player in England with only a row of  pawns. They won the game all right. But the ball broke to pieces. I  never smelt such a stench in all my life.    The three sailors took it stoically enough, they signed on to  different ships and went back again to the sea, and the world of chess  lost sight, for ever I trust, of the most remarkable players it ever  knew, who would have altogether spoiled the game.            The Exiles Club    It was an evening party; and something someone had said to me had  started me talking about a subject that to me is full of fascination,  the subject of old religions, forsaken gods. The truth (for all  religions have some of it), the wisdom, the beauty, of the religions  of countries to which I travel have not the same appeal for me; for  one only notices in them their tyranny and intolerance and the abject  servitude that they claim from thought; but when a dynasty has been  dethroned in heaven and goes forgotten and outcast even among men,  one's eyes no longer dazzled by its power find something very wistful  in the faces of fallen gods suppliant to be remembered, something  almost tearfully beautiful, like a long warm summer twilight fading  gently away after some day memorable in the story of earthly wars.  Between what Zeus, for instance, has been once and the half-remembered  tale he is today there lies a space so great that there is no change  of fortune known to man whereby we may measure the height down which  he has fallen. And it is the same with many another god at whom once  the ages trembled and the twentieth century treats as an old wives'  tale. The fortitude that such a fall demands is surely more than  human.    Some such things as these I was saying, and being upon a subject that  much attracts me I possibly spoke too loudly, certainly I was not  aware that standing close behind me was no less a person than the  ex-King of Eritivaria, the thirty islands of the East, or I would have  moderated my voice and moved away a little to give him more room. I  was not aware of his presence until his satellite, one who had fallen  with him into exile but still revolved about him, told me that his  master desired to know me; and so to my surprise I was presented  though neither of them even knew my name. And that was how I came to  be invited by the ex-King to dine at his club.    At the time I could only account for his wishing to know me by  supposing that he found in his own exiled condition some likeness to  the fallen fortunes of the gods of whom I talked unwitting of his  presence; but now I know that it was not of himself he was thinking  when he asked me to dine at that club.    The club would have been the most imposing building "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#20)"],[1,"had the samurai spirit to  the full. Indeed, in absolute fearlessness and assumption of  superiority, he out-samuraied the samurai. He was a man of impressive  and imperious personality. Yet it is a significant fact that when he  was brought back to Japan by his former pupils, after an absence of  about eighteen years, during which they had continued to extol his  merits and revere his memory, it was not long before they discovered  that he was not the man their imagination had created. Not many months  were needed to remove him from his pedestal. It would hardly be a fair  statement of the whole case to leave the matter here. So far as I  know, President Clark and Rev. S.R. Brown have always retained their  hold on the imagination of the Japanese. The foreigner who of all  others has perhaps done the most for Japan, and whose services have  been most heartily acknowledged by the nation and government, was Dr.  Guido F. Verbeck, who began his missionary work in 1859; he was the  teacher of large numbers of the young men who became leaders in the  transformation of Japan; he alone of foreigners was made a citizen and  was given a free and general pass for travel; and his funeral in 1898  was attended by the nobility of the land, and the Emperor himself made  a contribution toward the expenses. Dr. Verbeck is destined to be one  of Japan's few foreign heroes.    Among the signs of Japanese craving for heroes may be mentioned the  constant experience of missionaries when search is being made for a  man to fill a particular place. The descriptions of the kind of man  desired are such that no one can expect to meet him. The Christian  boys' school in Kumamoto, and the church with it, went for a whole  year without principal and pastor because they could not secure a man  of national reputation. They wanted a hero-principal, who would cut a  great figure in local politics and also be a hero-leader for the  Christian work in the whole island of Kyushu, causing the school to  shine not only in Kumamoto, but to send forth its light and its fame  throughout the Empire and even to foreign lands. The unpretentious,  unprepossessing-looking man who was chosen temporarily, though endowed  with common sense and rather unusual ability to harmonize the various  elements in the school, was not deemed satisfactory. He was too much  like Socrates. At last they found a man after their own heart. He had  traveled and studied long abroad; was a dashing, brilliant fellow;  would surely make things hum; so at least said those who recommended  him (and he did). But he was still a poor student in Scotland; his  passage money must be raised by the school if he was to be secured.  And raised it was. Four hundred and seventy-five dollars those one  hundred and fifty poor boys and girls, who lived on two dollars a  month, scantily clothed and insufficiently warmed, secured from their  parents and sent across the seas to bring back him who was to be their  hero-principal and pastor. The rest of the story I need not tell in  detail, but I may whisper that he was more of a slashing hero than  they planned for; in three months the boys' school was split in twain  and in less than three years both fragments of the school had not only  lost all their Christian character, but were dead and gone forever.  And the grounds on which the buildings stood were turned into mulberry  fields.    Talking not long since to a native friend, concerning the  hero-worshiping tendency of the Japanese, I had my attention called to  the fact that, while what has been said above is substantially correct  as concerns a large proportion of the people, especially the young  men, there is nevertheless a class whose ideal heroes are not  military, but moral. Their power arises not through self-assertion,  but rather through humility; their influence is due entirely to  learning coupled with insight into the great moral issues of life.  Such has been the character of not a few of the \"moral\" teachers. I  have recently read a Japanese novel based upon the life of one such  hero. Omi Seijin, or the \"Sage of Omi,\" is a name well known among  the people of Japan; and his fame rests rather on his character than  on his learning. If tradition is correct, his influence on the people  of his region was powerful enough to transform the character of the  place, producing a paradise on earth whence lust and crime were  banished. Whatever the actual facts of his life may have been, this is  certainly the representation of his character now held up for honor  and imitation. There are also indications that the ideal military hero  is not, for all the people, the self-assertive type that I have  described above, though this is doubtless the prevalent one. Not long  since I heard the following couplet as to the nature of a true hero:                \"Makoto no Ei-yu;  Sono yo, aizen to shite shumpu no gotoshi;  Sono shin, kizen to shite kinseki no gotoshi.                \"The true Hero;  In appearance, charming like the spring breeze.  In heart, firm as a rock.\"    Another phrase that I have run across relating to the ideal man is, \"I  atte takakarazu,\" which means in plain English, \"having authority, but  not puffed up.\" In the presence of these facts, it will not do to  think that the ideal hero of all the Japanese is, or even in olden  times was, only a military hero full of swagger and bluster; in a  military age such would, of necessity, be a popular ideal; but just in  proportion as men rose to higher forms of learning, and character, so  would their ideals be raised.    It is not to be lightly assumed that the spirit of hero-worship is  wholly an evil or a necessarily harmful thing. It has its advantages  and rewards as well as its dangers and evils. The existence of  hero-worship in any land reveals a nature in the people that is  capable of heroic actions. Men appreciate and admire that which in a  measure at least they are, and more that which they aspire to become.  The recent war revealed how the capacity for heroism of a warlike  nature lies latent in every Japanese breast and not in the descendants  of the old military class alone. But it is more encouraging to note  that popular appreciation of moral heroes is growing.    Education and religion are bringing forth modern moral heroes. The  late Dr. Neesima, the founder of the Doshisha, is a hero to many even  outside the Church. Mr. Ishii, the father of Orphan Asylums in Japan,  promises to be another. A people that can rear and admire men of this  character has in it the material of a truly great nation.    The hero-worshiping characteristic of the Japanese depends on two  other traits of their nature. The first is the reality of strong  personalities among them capable of becoming heroes; the second is the  possession of a strong idealizing tendency. Prof. G.T. Ladd has called  them a \"sentimental\" people, in the sense that they are powerfully  moved by sentiment. This is a conspicuous trait of their character  appearing in numberless ways in their daily life. The passion for  group-photographs is largely due to this. Sentimentalism, in the sense  given it by Prof. Ladd, is the emotional aspect of idealism.    The new order of society is reacting on the older ideal of a hero and  is materially modifying it. The old-fashioned samurai, girded with two  swords, ready to kill a personal foe at sight, is now only the ideal  of romance. In actual life he would soon find himself deprived of his  liberty and under the condemnation not only of the law, but also of  public opinion. The new ideal with which I have come into most  frequent contact is far different. Many, possibly the majority, of the  young men and boys with whom I have talked as to their aim in life,  have said that they desired to secure first of all a thorough  education, in order that finally they might become great \"statesmen\"  and might guide the nation into paths of prosperity and international  power. The modern hero is one who gratifies the patriotic passion by  bringing some marked success to the nation. He must be a gentleman,  educated in science, in history, and in foreign languages; but above  all, he must be versed in political economy and law. This new ideal of  a national hero has been brought in by the order of society, and in  proportion as this order continues, and emphasis continues to be laid  on mental and moral power, rather than on rank or official position,  on the intrinsic rather than on the accidental, will the old ideal  fade away and the new ideal take its place. Among an idealizing and  emotional people, such as the Japanese, various ideals will naturally  find extreme expression. As society grows complex also and its various  elements become increasingly differentiated, so will the ideals pass  through the same transformations. A study of ideals, therefore, serves  several ends; it reveals the present character of those whose ideals  they are; it shows the degree of development of the social organism in  which they live; it makes known, likewise, the degree of the  differentiation that has taken place between the various elements of  the nation.          VIII    LOVE FOR CHILDREN      An aspect of Japanese life widely remarked and praised by foreign  writers is the love for children. Children's holidays, as the third  day of the third moon and the fifth day of the fifth moon, are general  celebrations for boys and girls respectively, and are observed with  much gayety all over the land. At these times the universal aim is to  please the children; the girls have dolls and the exhibition of  ancestral dolls; while the boys have toy paraphernalia of all the  ancient and modern forms of warfare, and enormous wind-inflated paper  fish, symbols of prosperity and success, fly from tall bamboos in the  front yard. Contrary to the prevailing opinion among foreigners, these  festivals have nothing whatever to do with birthday celebrations."]]]
