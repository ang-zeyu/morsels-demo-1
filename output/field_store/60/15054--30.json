Vermicelli is very well  adapted for this broth.           *       *       *       *       *    RESTORATIVE JELLIES.    There are various kinds of simple restorative jellies suited to an  invalid, among the best are the following:--           *       *       *       *       *    HARTSHORN JELLY.    Boil half a pound of hartshorn shavings in two quarts of water over a  gentle fire until it becomes thick enough to hang about a spoon, then  strain it into a clean saucepan and add half a pint of sherry wine,  and a quarter of a pound of white sugar, clear it by stirring in the  whites of a couple of eggs, whisked to a froth; boil it for about four  or five minutes, add the juice of three lemons, and stir all together,  when it is well curdled, strain it and pour into the mould, if the  color is required to be deeper than the wine will make it, a little  saffron may be boiled in it.           *       *       *       *       *    BARLEY JELLY.    Boil in an iron saucepan, one tea-cup full of pearl barley, with one  quart of cold water, pour off the water when it boils, and add another  quart, let it simmer very gently for three hours over or near a slow  fire, stirring it frequently with a wooden spoon, strain it, and  sweeten with white sugar, add the juice of a lemon, a little white  wine, and a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dissolved in a little  water, and pour it into a mould. This is a very nourishing jelly.           *       *       *       *       *    CAUDLE.    Make a fine smooth gruel of grits, with a few spices boiled in it,  strain it carefully and warm as required, adding white wine and a  little brandy, nutmeg, lemon peel, and sugar, according to taste, some  persons put the yolk of an egg.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE CAUDLE.    Boil half a pint of milk, add a spoonful of ground rice mixed with a  little milk till quite smooth, stir it into the boiling milk, let  it simmer till it thickens, carefully straining it, and sweeten with  white sugar.           *       *       *       *       *    BARLEY MILK.    Boil half a pound of pearl barley in one quart of new milk, taking  care to parboil it first in water, which must be poured off, sweeten  with white sugar. This is better made with pearl barley than the  prepared barley.           *       *       *       *       *    RESTORATIVE MILK.    Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass in a pint of new milk till  reduced to half, and sweeten with sugar candy.           *       *       *       *       *    MILK PORRIDGE.    Make a fine gruel with new milk without adding any water, strain  it when sufficiently thick, and sweeten with white sugar. This is  extremely nutritive and fattening.           *       *       *       *       *    WINE WHEY.    Set on the fire in a saucepan a pint of milk, when it boils, pour in  as much white wine as will turn it into curds, boil it up, let the  curds settle, strain off, and add a little boiling water, and sweeten  to taste.           *       *       *       *       *    TAMARIND WHEY.    Boil three ounces of tamarinds in two pints of milk, strain off the  curds, and let it cool. This is a very refreshing drink.           *       *       *       *       *    PLAIN WHEY.    Put into boiling milk as much lemon juice or vinegar as will turn it,  and make the milk clear, strain, add hot water, and sweeten.           *       *       *       *       *    ORGEAT.    Beat three ounces of almonds with a table-spoonful of orange-flour  water, and one bitter almond; then pour one pint of new milk, and one  pint of water to the paste, and sweeten with sifted white sugar; half  an ounce of gum-arabic is a good addition for those who have a tender  chest.           *       *       *       *       *    IRISH MOSS.    Boil half an ounce of carrageen or Irish moss, in a pint and a half  of water or milk till it is reduced to a pint; it is a most excellent  drink for delicate persons or weakly children.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE SOFT DRINK FOR A COUGH.    Add to a quarter of a pint of new milk warmed, a beaten new laid egg,  with a spoonful of capillaire, and the same of rose water.           *       *       *       *       *    A REFRESHING DRINK.    Cut four large apples in slices, and pour over a quart of boiling  water, let them stand till cold, strain the liquor, and sweeten with  white sugar; a little lemon peel put with the apples improves the  flavour.           *       *       *       *       *    A VERY FINE EMMOLIENT DRINK.    Wash and rinse extremely well one ounce of pearl barley, then put to  it one ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a piece of lemon  peel, boil together till the liquor is of the thickness of cream and  perfectly smooth, then put in a little syrup of lemon and capillaire.           *       *       *       *       *    A COOLING DRINK IN FEVER.    Put a little tea-sage, and a couple of sprigs of balm into a jug, with  a lemon thinly sliced, and the peel cut into strips, pour over a quart  of boiling water, sweeten and let it cool.          APPENDIX.      FRENCH METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE.    Take in the proportion of one ounce of the berries to half a pint of  water, and grind them at the instant of using them. Put the powder  into a coffee biggin, press it down closely, and pour over a little  water sufficient to moisten it, and then add the remainder by degrees;  the water must be perfectly boiling all the time; let it run quite  through before the top of the percolator is taken off, it must be  served with an equal quantity of boiling milk. Coffee made in this  manner is much clearer and better flavored than when boiled, and it is  a much more economical method than boiling it.           *       *       *       *       *    A FRENCH RECEIPT FOR MAKING CHOCOLATE.    Take one ounce of chocolate, cut it in small pieces, and boil it about  six or seven minutes with a small teacup full of water; stir it till  smooth, then add nearly a pint of good milk, give it another boil,  stirring or milling it well, and serve directly. If required very  thick, a larger proportion of chocolate must be used.           *       *       *       *       *    EGG WINE.    Beat a fresh egg, and add it to a tumbler of white wine and water,  sweetened and spiced; set it on the fire, stir it gently one way until  it thickens; this, with toast, forms a light nutritive supper.           *       *       *       *       *    MULLED WINE.    Boil a little spice, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, in water, till the  flavor is gained, then add wine, as much as may be approved, sugar and  nutmeg; a strip or two of orange rind cut thin will be found a great  improvement.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE PUNCH.    To make one quart, provide two fine fresh lemons, and rub off the  outer peel upon a few lumps of sugar; put the sugar into a bowl with  four ounces of powdered sugar, upon which press the juice of the  lemons, and pour over one pint and a half of very hot water that  _has not boiled_, then add a quarter of a pint of rum, and the same  quantity of brandy; stir well together and strain it, and let it stand  a few minutes before it is drank.    Whiskey punch is made after the same method; the juice and thin peel  of a Seville orange add variety of flavor to punch, particularly of  whiskey punch.           *       *       *       *       *    MILK PUNCH.    Put into a quart of new milk the thinly pared rind of a lemon, and  four ounces of lump sugar; let it boil slowly, remove the peel, and  stir in the yolks of two eggs, previously mixed with a little cold  milk; add by degrees a tea-cup full of rum, the same of brandy;  mill the punch to a fine froth, and serve immediately in quite warm  glasses. The punch must not be allowed to boil after the eggs have  been added.           *       *       *       *       *    A FRENCH PLUM PIE.    Stew one pound of fine dried French plums until tender, in water,  rather more than enough to cover, with one glass of port wine, and  four ounces of white sugar, which must however not be added until  the plums are quite tender, then pour them with the liquor into a  pie-dish, and cover with a rich puff paste, and bake.           *       *       *       *       *    ROASTED CHESTNUTS FOR DESSERTS.    Chestnuts are so frequently sent to table uneatable, that we will  give the French receipt for them. They should be first boiled for five  minutes, and then finish them in a pan over the fire; they will after  the boiling require exactly fifteen minutes roasting; the skin must be  slightly cut before they are cooked.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST PARTRIDGES AND PHEASANTS.    They may be either _pique_ or not; partridges require roasting rather  more than half an hour, pheasants three-quarters, if small, otherwise  an hour; they are served with bread sauce.    Partridges may be stewed as pigeons.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST VENISON.    Wipe the venison dry, sprinkle with salt, and cover with writing paper  rubbed with clarified fat; cover this with a thick paste made of flour  and water, round which, tie with packthread white kitchen paper, so as  to prevent the paste coming off; set the venison before a strong  fire, and baste it directly and continue until it is nearly done, then  remove the paper, paste, &c.; draw the venison nearer the fire, dredge  it with flour, and continue basting; it should only take a light  brown, and should be rather under than over-done; a large haunch  requires from three to four hours roasting, a small one not above  three. Serve with the knuckle, garnished with a fringe of white paper,  and with gravy and red currant jelly, either cold or melted, in port  wine, and served hot.           *       *       *       *      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#20)"],[1,"ustained, not only by common  observation, but by experimental proof, and so the mechanistic view  will be found in complete harmony with another important reaction.    We have stated that when a number of contact stimuli act simultaneously,  the strongest stimulus will gain possession of the final common path--  the path of action.  When, however, stimuli of the distance ceptors  compete with stimuli of the contact ceptors, the contact-ceptor  stimuli often secure the common path, not because they are stronger  or more important, but because they are immediate and urgent.  In many instances, however, the distance-ceptor stimuli are strong,  have the advantage of a lowered threshold, and therefore compete  successfully with the immediate and present stimuli of the  contact ceptors.  In such cases we have the interesting phenomenon  of physical injury without resultant pain or muscular response.  The distance-ceptor stimuli which may thus triumph over even powerful  contact-ceptor stimuli are those causing strong emotions--as great  anger in fighting; great fear in a battle; intense sexual excitement.  Dr. Livingstone has testified to his complete unconsciousness  to pain during his struggle with a lion; although he was torn  by teeth and claws, his fear overcame all other impressions.  By frequently repeated stimulation the Dervish secures a low  threshold to the emotions caused by the thought of God or the devil,  and his emotional excitement is increased by the presence of others  under the same stimulation; emotion, therefore, secures the final  common path and he is unconscious of pain when he lashes, cuts,  and bruises his body.  The phenomena of hysteria may be explained  on this basis, as may the unconsciousness of passing events  in a person in the midst of a great and overwhelming grief.  By constant practice the student may secure the final common path for  such impressions as are derived from the stimuli offered by the subject  of his study, and so he will be oblivious of his surroundings.  Concentration is but another name for a final common path secured  by the repetition and summation of certain stimuli.    If our premises are sustained, then we can recognize in man no will,  no ego, no possibility for spontaneous action, for every action must  be a response to the stimuli of contact or distance ceptors, or to their  recall through associative memory.  Memory is awakened by symbols which  represent any of the objects or forces associated with the act recalled.  Spoken and written words, pictures, sounds, may stimulate the brain  patterns formed by previous stimulation of the distance ceptors;  while touch, pain, temperature, pressure, may recall previous  contact-ceptor stimuli.  Memory depends in part upon the adequacy  of the symbol, and in part upon the state of the threshold.  If one has ever been attacked by a snake, the threshold to any  symbol which could recall that attack would be low; the later  recall of anything associated with the bite or its results would  produce in memory a recapitulation of the whole scene, while even  harmless snakes would thereafter be greeted with a shudder.  On the other hand, in a child the threshold is low to the desire  for the possession of any new and strange object; in a child,  therefore, to whom a snake is merely an unusual and fascinating object,  there is aroused only curiosity and the desire for the possession  of a new plaything.    If we are to attribute to man the possession of a governing  attribute not possessed by other parts of the animal creation,  where are we to draw the boundary line, and say \"here the ego--  the will--the reason--emerges\"? What attribute, after all, has man  which in its ultimate analysis is not possessed by the lowest  animals or by the vegetable creation, even?  From the ameba,  on through all the stages of animal existence, every action is  but a response to an adequate stimulus; and as a result of adequate  stimuli each step has been taken toward the higher and more  intricate mechanisms which play the higher and more intricate parts  in the great scheme of nature.    The Venus fly-trap responds to as delicate a stimulus as do  any of the contact ceptors of animals, and the motor activity  resulting from the stimulus is as complex.  To an insect-like touch  the plant responds; to a rough contact there is no response; that is,  the motor mechanism of the plant has become attuned to only such  stimuli as simulate the contact of those insects which form its diet.  It catches flies, eats and digests them, and ejects the refuse  (Fig. 47). The ameba does no less.  The frog does no more,  excepting that in its place in creation a few more reactions are  required for its sustenance and for the propagation of its species.  Man does no more, excepting that in man's manifold relations  there are innumerable stimuli, for meeting which adequately,  innumerable mechanisms have been evolved.  The motor mechanism  of the fly-trap is perfectly adapted to its purpose.  The motor mechanism of man is adapted to its manifold uses,  and as new environmental influences surround him, we must believe  that new adaptations of the mechanism will be evolved to meet  the new conditions.    Is not this conception of man's activities infinitely more wonderful,  and infinitely more comprehensible than is the conception that his  activities may be accounted for by the existence of an unknown,  unimaginable, and intangible force called \"mind\" or \"soul\"?    We have already shown how the nerve mechanism is so well adapted  to the innumerable stimuli of environment that it can accurately  transmit and distinguish between the infinite variations of speed  in the ether waves producing light, and the air waves producing sound.  Each rate of vibration energizes only the mechanism which has  been attuned to it.  With marvelous accuracy the light and sound  waves gain access to the nerve tissue and are finally interpreted  in terms of motor responses, each by the brain pattern attuned  to that particular speed and intensity.  So stimuli and resultant  actions multiplied by the total number of the motor patterns  in the brain of man give us the sum total of his life's activities--  they constitute his life.    As in evolutionary history the permanence of an adaptation of the body  mechanism depends upon its value in the preservation of the life  of the individual and upon its power to increase the value of  the individual to the race, so the importance and truth of these  postulates and theories may well be judged on the same basis.    The fundamental instincts of all living matter are self-preservation  and the propagation of the species.  The instinct for self-preservation  causes a plant to turn away from cold and damaging winds toward  the life-giving sun; the inert mussel to withdraw within its shell;  the insect to take flight; the animal to fight or to flee; and man  to procure food that he may oppose starvation, to shelter himself  and to provide clothes that he may avoid the dangers of excessive  cold and heat, to combat death from disease by seeking medical aid,  to avoid destruction by man or brute by fight or by flight.  The instinct to propagate the species leads brute man by crude methods,  and cultured man by methods more refined, to put out of his way sex  rivals so that his own life may be continued through offspring.  The life of the species is further assured by the protective  action exercised over the young by the adults of the species.  As soon as the youngest offspring is able successfully to carry on his  own struggle with environment there is no longer need for the parent,  and the parent enters therefore the stage of disintegration.  The average length of life in any species is the sum of the years  of immaturity, plus the years of female fertility, plus the adolescent  years of the offspring.    The stimuli resulting from these two dominant instincts are now  so overpowering as compared with all other environmental stimuli  that the mere possession of adequate knowledge of the damaging effects  of certain actions as compared with the saving effects of others will  (other things being equal) lead the individual to choose the right,--  the self- and species-preservative course of action, instead of the wrong,--  the self- and species-destructive course of action.    The dissemination of the knowledge of the far-reaching  deleterious effects of protracted emotional strain, of overwork,  and of worry will automatically raise man's threshold to  the damaging activating stimuli causing the strong emotions,  and will cause him to avoid dangerous strains of every kind.  The individual thus protected will therefore rise to a plane  of poise and efficiency far above that of his uncontrolled fellows,  and by so much will his efficiency, health, and happiness be augmented.    A full acceptance of this theory cannot fail to produce in those  in whose charge rests the welfare of the young, an overwhelming  desire to surround children with those environmental stimuli only  which will tend to their highest ultimate welfare.    Such is the stimulating force of tradition that many who  have been educated under the tenets of traditional beliefs  will oppose these hypotheses--even violently, it may be.  So they have opposed them; so they opposed Darwin; so they  have opposed all new and apparently revolutionary doctrines.  Yet these persons themselves are by their very actions proving  the efficiency of the vital principles which we have enunciated.  What is the whole social welfare movement but a recognition  on the part of municipalities, educational boards, and religious  organizations of the fact that the future welfare of the race  depends upon the administration to the young of forceful  uplifting environmental stimuli?    There are now, as there were in Darwin's day, many who feel that man  is degraded from his high estate by the"]]]
