Mr. Marchdale, this is Mr  Holland, of whom you have heard me speak.\"    \"I am proud to know you, sir,\" said Marchdale.    \"Sir, I thank you,\" replied Holland, coldly.    It will so happen; but, at first sight, it appeared as if those two  persons had some sort of antagonistic feeling towards each other, which  threatened to prevent effectually their ever becoming intimate friends.    The appeal of Henry to the servants to know if they could tell him what  had occurred was answered in the negative. All they knew was that they  had heard two shots fired, and that, since then, they had remained where  they were, in a great fright, until the bell was rung violently. This  was no news at all and, therefore, the only chance was, to wait  patiently for the recovery of the mother, or of Flora, from one or the  other of whom surely some information could be at once then procured.    Mrs. Bannerworth was removed to her own room, and so would Flora have  been; but Mr. Holland, who was supporting her in his arms, said,--    \"I think the air from the open window is recovering her, and it is  likely to do so. Oh, do not now take her from me, after so long an  absence. Flora, Flora, look up; do you not know me? You have not yet  given me one look of acknowledgment. Flora, dear Flora!\"    The sound of his voice seemed to act as the most potent of charms in  restoring her to consciousness; it broke through the death-like trance  in which she lay, and, opening her beautiful eyes, she fixed them upon  his face, saying,--    \"Yes, yes; it is Charles--it is Charles.\"    She burst into a hysterical flood of tears, and clung to him like some  terrified child to its only friend in the whole wide world.    \"Oh, my dear friends,\" cried Charles Holland, \"do not deceive me; has  Flora been ill?\"    \"We have all been ill,\" said George.    \"All ill?\"    \"Ay, and nearly mad,\" exclaimed Harry.    Holland looked from one to the other in surprise, as well he might, nor  was that surprise at all lessened when Flora made an effort to extricate  herself from his embrace, as she exclaimed,--    \"You must leave me--you must leave me, Charles, for ever! Oh! never,  never look upon my face again!\"    \"I--I am bewildered,\" said Charles.    \"Leave me, now,\" continued Flora; \"think me unworthy; think what you  will, Charles, but I cannot, I dare not, now be yours.\"    \"Is this a dream?\"    \"Oh, would it were. Charles, if we had never met, you would be  happier--I could not be more wretched.\"    \"Flora, Flora, do you say these words of so great cruelty to try my  love?\"    \"No, as Heaven is my judge, I do not.\"    \"Gracious Heaven, then, what do they mean?\"    Flora shuddered, and Henry, coming up to her, took her hand in his  tenderly, as he said,--    \"Has it been again?\"    \"It has.\"    \"You shot it?\"    \"I fired full upon it, Henry, but it fled.\"    \"It did--fly?\"    \"It did, Henry, but it will come again--it will be sure to come again.\"    \"You--you hit it with the bullet?\" interposed Mr. Marchdale. \"Perhaps  you killed it?\"    \"I think I must have hit it, unless I am mad.\"    Charles Holland looked from one to the other with such a look of intense  surprise, that George remarked it, and said at once to him,--    \"Mr. Holland, a full explanation is due to you, and you shall have it.\"    \"You seem the only rational person here,\" said Charles. \"Pray what is it  that everybody calls '_it_?'\"    \"Hush--hush!\" said Henry; \"you shall hear soon, but not at present.\"    \"Hear me, Charles,\" said Flora. \"From this moment mind, I do release you  from every vow, from every promise made to me of constancy and love; and  if you are wise, Charles, and will be advised, you will now this moment  leave this house never to return to it.\"    \"No,\" said Charles--\"no; by Heaven I love you, Flora! I have come to say  again all that in another clime I said with joy to you. When I forget  you, let what trouble may oppress you, may God forget me, and my own  right hand forget to do me honest service.\"    [Illustration]    \"Oh! no more--no more!\" sobbed Flora.    \"Yes, much more, if you will tell me of words which shall be stronger  than others in which to paint my love, my faith, and my constancy.\"    \"Be prudent,\" said Henry. \"Say no more.\"    \"Nay, upon such a theme I could speak for ever. You may cast me off,  Flora; but until you tell me you love another, I am yours till the  death, and then with a sanguine hope at my heart that we shall meet  again, never, dearest, to part.\"    Flora sobbed bitterly.    \"Oh!\" she said, \"this is the unkindest blow of all--this is worse than  all.\"    \"Unkind!\" echoed Holland.    \"Heed her not,\" said Henry; \"she means not you.\"    \"Oh, no--no!\" she cried. \"Farewell, Charles--dear Charles.\"    \"Oh, say that word again!\" he exclaimed, with animation. \"It is the  first time such music has met my ears.\"    \"It must be the last.\"    \"No, no--oh, no.\"    \"For your own sake I shall be able now, Charles, to show you that I  really loved you.\"    \"Not by casting me from you?\"    \"Yes, even so. That will be the way to show you that I love you.\"    She held up her hands wildly, as she added, in an excited voice,--    \"The curse of destiny is upon me! I am singled out as one lost and  accursed. Oh, horror--horror! would that I were dead!\"    Charles staggered back a pace or two until he came to the table, at  which he clutched for support. He turned very pale as he said, in a  faint voice,--    \"Is--is she mad, or am I?\"    \"Tell him I am mad, Henry,\" cried Flora. \"Do not, oh, do not make his  lonely thoughts terrible with more than that. Tell him I am mad.\"    \"Come with me,\" whispered Henry to Holland. \"I pray you come with me at  once, and you shall know all.\"    \"I--will.\"    \"George, stay with Flora for a time. Come, come, Mr. Holland, you ought,  and you shall know all; then you can come to a judgment for yourself.  This way, sir. You cannot, in the wildest freak of your imagination,  guess that which I have now to tell you.\"    Never was mortal man so utterly bewildered by the events of the last  hour of his existence as was now Charles Holland, and truly he might  well be so. He had arrived in England, and made what speed he could to  the house of a family whom he admired for their intelligence, their high  culture, and in one member of which his whole thoughts of domestic  happiness in this world were centered, and he found nothing but  confusion, incoherence, mystery, and the wildest dismay.    Well might he doubt if he were sleeping or waking--well might he ask if  he or they were mad.    And now, as, after a long, lingering look of affection upon the pale,  suffering face of Flora, he followed Henry from the room, his thoughts  were busy in fancying a thousand vague and wild imaginations with  respect to the communication which was promised to be made to him.    But, as Henry had truly said to him, not in the wildest freak of his  imagination could he conceive of any thing near the terrible strangeness  and horror of that which he had to tell him, and consequently he found  himself closeted with Henry in a small private room, removed from the  domestic part of the hall, to the full in as bewildered a state as he  had been from the first.          CHAPTER XI.    THE COMMUNICATIONS TO THE LOVER.--THE HEART'S DESPAIR.      [Illustration]    Consternation is sympathetic, and any one who had looked upon the  features of Charles Holland, now that he was seated with Henry  Bannerworth, in expectation of a communication which his fears told him  was to blast all his dearest and most fondly cherished hopes for ever,  would scarce have recognised in him the same young man who, one short  hour before, had knocked so loudly, and so full of joyful hope and  expectation, at the door of the hall.    But so it was. He knew Henry Bannerworth too well to suppose that any  unreal cause could blanch his cheek. He knew Flora too well to imagine  for one moment that caprice had dictated the, to him, fearful words of  dismissal she had uttered to him.    Happier would it at that time have been for Charles Holland had she  acted capriciously towards him, and convinced him that his true heart's  devotion had been cast at the feet of one unworthy of so really noble a  gift. Pride would then have enabled him, no doubt, successfully to  resist the blow. A feeling of honest and proper indignation at having  his feelings trifled with, would, no doubt, have sustained him, but,  alas! the case seemed widely different.    True, she implored him to think of her no more--no longer to cherish in  his breast the fond dream of affection which had been its guest so long;  but the manner in which she did so brought along with it an irresistible  conviction, that she was making a noble sacrifice of her own feelings  for him, from some cause which was involved in the profoundest mystery.    But now he was to hear all. Henry had promised to tell him, and as he  looked into his pale, but handsomely intellectual face, he half dreaded  the disclosure he yet panted to hear.    \"Tell me all, Henry--tell me all,\" he said. \"Upon the words that come  from your lips I know I can rely.\"    \"I will have no reservations with you,\" said Henry, sadly. \"You ought to  know all, and you shall. Prepare yourself for the strangest revelation  you ever heard.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Ay. One which in hearing you may well doubt; and one which, I hope, you  will never find an opportunity of verifying.\"    \"You speak in riddles.\"    \"And yet speak truly, Charles. You heard with what a frantic vehemence  Flora desired you to think no more of her?\"    \"I did--I did.\"    \"Sh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#20)"],[1,"theatrical ermine and antique  jewelry. When these high-born dames met each other in the vestibule,  they spoke with heavy voices and expressive gestures, emphasizing their  words energetically. The daughter of the ranch ventured to salute them  because she had subscribed to all their pet charities, and upon  seeing her greeting returned, she felt a satisfaction which made her  momentarily forget her woes. They belonged to those families which her  father had so greatly admired without knowing why. They came from the  \"mother country,\" and to the good Chicha were all Excelentisimas or  Altisimas, related to kings. She did not know whether to give them her  hand or bend the knee, as she had vaguely heard was the custom at court.  But soon she recalled her preoccupation and went forward to wrestle  in prayer with God. Ay, that he would mercifully remember her! That he  would not long forget her son! . . .    It was Glory that remembered Julio, stretching out to him her arms of  light, so that he suddenly awoke to find himself surrounded by all the  honors and advantages of celebrity. Fame cunningly surprises mankind on  the most crooked and unexpected of roads. Neither the painting of souls  nor a fitful existence full of extravagant love affairs and complicated  duels had brought Desnoyers this renown. It was Glory that put him on  his feet.    A new pleasure for the delight of humanity had come from the other side  of the seas. People were asking one another in the mysterious tones of  the initiated who wish to recognize a familiar spirit, \"Do you know how  to tango? . . .\" The tango had taken possession of the world. It was  the heroic hymn of a humanity that was suddenly concentrating its  aspirations on the harmonious rhythm of the thigh joints, measuring its  intelligence by the agility of its feet. An incoherent and monotonous  music of African inspiration was satisfying the artistic ideals of  a society that required nothing better. The world was dancing . . .  dancing . . . dancing.    A negro dance from Cuba introduced into South America by mariners who  shipped jerked beef to the Antilles, conquered the entire earth in a few  months, completely encircling it, bounding victoriously from nation to  nation . . . like the Marseillaise. It was even penetrating into the  most ceremonious courts, overturning all traditions of conservation and  etiquette like a song of the Revolution--the revolution of frivolity.  The Pope even had to become a master of the dance, recommending the  \"Furlana\" instead of the \"Tango,\" since all the Christian world,  regardless of sects, was united in the common desire to agitate its feet  with the tireless frenzy of the \"possessed\" of the Middle Ages.    Julio Desnoyers, upon meeting this dance of his childhood in full swing  in Paris, devoted himself to it with the confidence that an old love  inspires. Who could have foretold that when as a student, he was  frequenting the lowest dance halls in Buenos Aires, watched by the  police, that he was really serving an apprenticeship to Glory? . . .    From five to seven, in the salons of the Champs d'Elysees where it cost  five francs for a cup of tea and the privilege of joining in the sacred  dance, hundreds of eyes followed him with admiration. \"He has the key,\"  said the women, appraising his slender elegance, medium stature, and  muscular springs. And he, in abbreviated jacket and expansive shirt  bosom, with his small, girlish feet encased in high-heeled patent  leathers with white tops, danced gravely, thoughtfully, silently, like  a mathematician working out a problem, under the lights that shed bluish  tones upon his plastered, glossy locks. Ladies asked to be presented  to him in the sweet hope that their friends might envy them when they  beheld them in the arms of the master. Invitations simply rained upon  Julio. The most exclusive salons were thrown open to him so that every  afternoon he made a dozen new acquaintances. The fashion had brought  over professors from the other side of the sea, compatriots from the  slums of Buenos Aires, haughty and confused at being applauded like  famous lecturers or tenors; but Julio triumphed over these vulgarians  who danced for money, and the incidents of his former life were  considered by the women as deeds of romantic gallantry.    \"You are killing yourself,\" Argensola would say. \"You are dancing too  much.\"    The glory of his friend and master was only making more trouble for  him. His placid readings before the fire were now subject to daily  interruptions. It was impossible to read more than a chapter. The  celebrated man was continually ordering him to betake himself to the  street. \"A new lesson,\" sighed the parasite. And when he was alone in  the studio numerous callers--all women, some inquisitive and aggressive,  others sad, with a deserted air--were constantly interrupting his  thoughtful pursuits.    One of them terrified the occupants of the studio with her insistence.  She was a North American of uncertain age, somewhere between thirty-two  and fifty-nine, with short skirts that whenever she sat down, seemed  to fly up as if moved by a spring. Various dances with Desnoyers and  a visit to the rue de la Pompe she seemed to consider as her sacred  rights, and she pursued the master with the desperation of an abandoned  zealot. Julio had made good his escape upon learning that this beauty  of youthful elegance--when seen from the back--had two grandchildren.  \"MASTER Desnoyers has gone out,\" Argensola would invariably say upon  receiving her. And, thereupon she would burst into tears and threats,  longing to kill herself then and there that her corpse might frighten  away those other women who would come to rob her of what she considered  her special privilege. Now it was Argensola who sped his companion to  the street when he wished to be alone. He had only to remark casually,  \"I believe that Yankee is coming,\" and the great man would beat a hasty  retreat, oftentimes in his desperate flight availing himself of the back  stairs.    At this time began to develop the most important event in Julio's  existence. The Desnoyers family was to be united with that of Senator  Lacour. Rene, his only son, had succeeded in awakening in Chichi a  certain interest that was almost love. The dignitary enjoyed thinking  of his son allied to the boundless plains and immense herds whose  description always affected him like a marvellous tale. He was a  widower, but he enjoyed giving at his home famous banquets and parties.  Every new celebrity immediately suggested to him the idea of giving a  dinner. No illustrious person passing through Paris, polar explorer  or famous singer, could escape being exhibited in the dining room  of Lacour. The son of Desnoyers--at whom he had scarcely glanced  before--now inspired him with sudden interest. The senator was a  thoroughly up-to-date man who did not classify glory nor distinguish  reputations. It was enough for him that a name should be on everybody's  lips for him to accept it with enthusiasm. When Julio responded to his  invitation, he presented him with pride to his friends, and came very  near to calling him \"dear master.\" The tango was monopolizing all  conversation nowadays. Even in the Academy they were taking it up in  order to demonstrate that the youth of ancient Athens had diverted  itself in a somewhat similar way. . . . And Lacour had dreamed all his  life of an Athenian republic.    At these reunions, Desnoyers became acquainted with the Lauriers. He was  an engineer who owned a motor-factory for automobiles in the outskirts  of Paris--a man about thirty-five, tall, rather heavy and silent, with  a deliberate air as though he wished to see deeply into men and  things. She was of a light, frivolous character, loving life for the  satisfactions and pleasures which it brought her, appearing to accept  with smiling conformity the silent and grave adoration of her husband.  She could not well do less with a man of his merits. Besides, she had  brought to the marriage a dowry of three hundred thousand francs, a  capital which had enabled the engineer to enlarge his business. The  senator had been instrumental in arranging this marriage. He was  interested in Laurier because he was the son of an old friend.    Upon Marguerite Laurier the presence of Julio flashed like a ray of  sunlight in the tiresome salon of Lacour. She was dancing the fad of the  hour and frequenting the tango teas where reigned the adored Desnoyers.  And to think that she was being entertained with this celebrated and  interesting man that the other women were raving about! . . . In order  that he might not take her for a mere middle-class woman like the other  guests at the senator's party, she spoke of her modistes, all from the  rue de la Paix, declaring gravely that no woman who had any self-respect  could possibly walk through the streets wearing a gown costing less than  eight hundred francs, and that the hat of a thousand francs--but a few  years ago, an astonishing novelty--was nowadays a very ordinary affair.    This acquaintanceship made the \"little Laurier,\" as her friends called  her notwithstanding her tallness, much sought by the master of the  dance, in spite of the looks of wrath and envy hurled at her by the  others. What a triumph for the wife of a simple engineer who was used  to going everywhere in her mother's automobile! . . . Julio at first  had supposed her like all the others who were languishing in his arms,  following the rhythmic complications of the dance, but he soon found  that she was very different. Her coquetry after the first confidential  words, but increased his admiration. He really had never before been  thrown with a woman of her class. Those of his first social period were  the habituees of the night restaurants paid for their witchery. Now  Glory was tossing into his arms ladies of high position but with"]]]
