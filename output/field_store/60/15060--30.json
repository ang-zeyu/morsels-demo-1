In the course of this his employment, having found some who had approved  his tracts, and to whom, on that account, he wished to write, and sending  his tracts to others, to whom he thought it proper to introduce them by  letter, he found himself engaged in a correspondence, which much engrossed  his time, but which proved of great importance in procuring many advocates  for his cause.    In the year 1762, when he had obtained a still greater store of  information, he published a larger work. This, however, he entitled, A  short Account of that Part of Africa inhabited by the Negros. In 1767 he  published, A Caution and Warning to Great Britain and her Colonies, on the  Calamitous State of the enslaved Negros in the British Dominions;--and soon  after this, appeared, An Historical Account of Guinea; its Situation,  Produce, and the General Disposition of its Inhabitants; with an Inquiry  into the Rise and Progress of the Slave-Trade, its Nature, and Calamitous  Effects. This pamphlet contained a clear and distinct development of the  subject, from the best authorities. It contained also the sentiments of  many enlightened men upon it; and it became instrumental, beyond any other  book ever before published, in disseminating a proper knowledge and  detestation of this trade.    Anthony Benezet may be considered as one of the most zealous, vigilant, and  active advocates, which the cause of the oppressed Africans ever had. He  seemed to have been born and to have lived for the promotion of it, and  therefore he never omitted any the least opportunity of serving it. If a  person called upon him who was going a journey, his first thoughts usually  were, how he could make him an instrument in its favour; and he either gave  him tracts to distribute, or he sent letters by him, or he gave him some  commission on the subject, so that he was the means of employing several  persons at the same time, in various parts of America, in advancing the  work he had undertaken.    In the same manner he availed himself of every other circumstance, as far  as he could, to the same end. When he heard that Mr. Granville Sharp had  obtained, in the year 1772, the noble verdict in the cause of Somerset the  slave, he opened a correspondence with him, which he kept up, that there  might be an union of action between them for the future, as far as it could  be effected, and that they might each give encouragement to the other to  proceed.    He opened also a correspondence with George Whitfield and John Wesley, that  these might assist him in promoting the cause of the oppressed.    He wrote also a letter to the Countess of Huntingdon on the following  subject.--She had founded a college, at the recommendation of George  Whitfield, called the Orphan-house, near Savannah, in Georgia, and had  endowed it. The object of this institution was, to furnish scholastic  instruction to the poor, and to prepare some of them for the ministry.  George Whitfield, ever attentive to the cause of the poor Africans, thought  that this institution might have been useful to them also; but soon after  his death, they who succeeded him bought slaves, and these in unusual  numbers, to extend the rice and indigo plantations belonging to the  college. The letter then in question was written by Anthony Benezet, in  order to lay before the Countess, as a religious woman, the misery she was  occasioning in Africa, by allowing the managers of her college in Georgia  to give encouragement to the Slave-trade. The Countess replied, that such a  measure should never have her countenance, and that she would take care to  prevent it.    On discovering that the Abbe Raynal had brought out his celebrated work, in  which he manifested a tender feeling in behalf of the injured Africans, he  entered into a correspondence with him, hoping to make him yet more useful  to their cause.    Finding, also, in the year 1783, that the Slave-trade, which had greatly  declined during the American war, was reviving, he addressed a pathetic  letter to our Queen, (as I mentioned in the last chapter,) who, on hearing  the high character of the writer of it from Benjamin West, received it with  marks of peculiar condescension and attention. The following is a copy of  it.        \"_To_ CHARLOTTE _Queen of Great Britain_.        \"IMPRESSED with a sense of religious duty, and encouraged by the      opinion generally entertained of thy benevolent disposition to      succour the distressed, I take the liberty, very respectfully, to      offer to thy perusal some tracts, which, I believe, faithfully      describe the suffering condition of many hundred thousands of our      fellow-creatures of the African race, great numbers of whom, rent      from every tender connection in life, are annually taken from their      native land, to endure, in the American islands and plantations, a      most rigorous and cruel slavery; whereby many, very many of them,      are brought to a melancholy and untimely end.        \"When it is considered that the inhabitants of Great Britain, who      are themselves so eminently blessed in the enjoyment of religious      and civil liberty, have long been, and yet are, very deeply      concerned in this flagrant violation of the common rights of      mankind, and that even its national authority is exerted in support      of the African Slave-trade, there is much reason to apprehend, that      this has been, and, as long as the evil exists, will continue to      be, an occasion of drawing down the Divine displeasure on the      nation and its dependencies. May these considerations induce thee      to interpose thy kind endeavours in behalf of this greatly injured      people, whose abject situation gives them an additional claim to      the pity and assistance of the generous mind, inasmuch as they are      altogether deprived of the means of soliciting effectual relief for      themselves; that so thou mayest not only be a blessed instrument in      the hand of him 'by whom kings reign and princes decree justice,'      to avert the awful judgments by which the empire has already been      so remarkably shaken, but that the blessings of thousands ready to      perish may come upon thee, at a time when the superior advantages      attendant on thy situation in this world will no longer be of any      avail to thy consolation and support.        \"To the tracts on this subject to which I have thus ventured to      crave thy particular attention, I have added some which at      different times I have believed it my duty to publish[A], and      which, I trust, will afford thee some satisfaction, their design      being for the furtherance of that universal peace and goodwill      amongst men, which the gospel was intended to introduce.        \"I hope thou wilt kindly excuse the freedom used on this occasion      by an ancient man, whose mind, for more than forty years past, has      been much separated from the common intercourse of the world, and      long painfully exercised in the consideration of the miseries under      which so large a part of mankind, equally with us the objects of      redeeming love, are suffering the most unjust and grievous      oppression, and who sincerely desires thy temporal and eternal      felicity, and that of thy royal consort.        \"ANTHONY BENEZET.\"    [Footnote A: These related to the principles of the religious society of  the Quakers.]    Anthony Benezet, besides the care he bestowed upon forwarding the cause of  the oppressed Africans in different parts of the world, found time to  promote the comforts, and improve the condition of those in the state in  which he lived. Apprehending that much advantage would arise both to them  and the public, from instructing them in common learning, he zealously  promoted the establishment of a school for that purpose. Much of the two  last years of his life he devoted to a personal attendance on this school,  being earnestly desirous that they who came to it might be better qualified  for the enjoyment of that freedom to restored. To this he sacrificed the  superior emoluments of his former school, and his bodily case also,  although the weakness of his constitution seemed to demand indulgence. By  his last will he directed, that, after the decease of his widow, his whole  little fortune (the savings of the industry of fifty years) should, except  a few very small legacies, be applied to the support of it. During his  attendance upon it he had the happiness to find, (and his situation enabled  him to make the comparison,) that Providence had been equally liberal to  the Africans in genius and talents as to other people.    After a few days' illness this excellent man died at Philadelphia in the  spring of 1784. The interment of his remains was attended by several  thousands of all ranks, professions, and parties, who united in deploring  their loss. The mournful procession was closed by some hundreds of those  poor Africans, who had been personally benefited by his labours, and whose  behaviour on the occasion showed the gratitude and affection they  considered to be due to him as their own private benefactor, as well as the  benefactor of their whole race.    Such, then, were the labours of the Quakers, in America, of individuals,  from 1718 to 1784, and of the body at large, from 1696 to 1787, in this  great cause of humanity and religion. Nor were the effects produced from  these otherwise than corresponding with what might have been expected from  such an union of exertion in such a cause; for both the evils, that is, the  evil of buying and selling, and the evil of using, slaves, ceased at length  with the members of this benevolent Society. The leaving off all concern  with the Slave-trade took place first. The abolition of slavery, though it  followed, was not so speedily accomplished; for, besides the loss of  property, when "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#20)"],[1," second command, \"Thou  shalt not make for thyself any graven image,\" some believe comes  from a period centuries later than Moses.  Possibly, as in Exodus  34:17, it originally read \"molten image\" and referred to foreign  idols.  If so, it may come in this older form from Moses.  The  tenth command which places the emphasis on the motive rather than  the act also suggests a maturer age; but with these possible  exceptions there is good reason for believing that the spirit and  teaching of Moses are embodied in this noble decalogue.    In what respects does the version in Deuteronomy 5 differ from that  in Exodus 20?  (_Hist. Bible_ I, 195.)  Which is probably the older  version?  What later explanations and exhortations have been added  to the original ten words in Exodus 20?  In Deuteronomy 5?  What  was the object of these additions?  Are they of real value?  Is it  profitable to teach them to children to-day?      II.    OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO GOD.    Into what two groups do the ten words in Exodus 20 fall?  And what  is the theme of each?  Is there a real difference between the  command of Exodus 34, \"Thou shalt worship no other gods\" and that  of Exodus 20, \"Thou shall have no other gods before me\"?  Did the  Hebrews as a matter of fact tolerate the worship of other gods in  their midst centuries after the days of Moses?  May the Hebrews  have originally interpreted the command of Exodus 20 as a demand  that Jehovah be given the first place in the worship and faith of  Israel?  How did later prophets like Elijah and Isaiah interpret  it?  (See I Kings 18:21 and Is. 6:1-8; 8:13.)  The older command in  Exodus 34, \"Thou shall make thee no molten gods,\" was probably  intended to guard the Israelites from imitating the religious  customs of their heathen neighbors, such as the Egyptians and the  Moabites.  The command to make no graven image was, it seems,  directed not against the public idols but against the private  images.  These were usually made of wood and were cherished in many  a Hebrew family, as for example, that of Jacob (cf. the story of  his flight from Laban, Gen. 31) or of David (I Sam. 19).  The  spirit of the law is truly interpreted by the later priestly  commentator who places completely under the ban all attempts  visibly to represent the Deity.  Is the spirit of this command  disregarded by the modern Greek church?  In certain parts of the  Roman Catholic world?  In any phases of Protestant worship?    How is the third command interpreted to-day?  The exact meaning of  the original Hebrew is not entirely clear.  It may be interpreted  literally: \"Thou shall not invoke the name of Jehovah, thy God, in  vain.\"  The interpretation turns on the meaning of the phrase, in  vain.  This admits of four different translations: (1)  Purposelessly, and therefore needlessly or irreverently; (2) for  destruction, as when a man calls down a curse upon another; (3) for  nothing, that is in swearing to what is not true; and (4) in the  practice of sorcery or witchcraft, for this word was frequently  used by the Hebrews as a scornful designation of heathen  abominations.  Is it possible that the original command was  intended to guard against each of these evils?  If so, it broadens  and deepens its modern application.  Its fundamental idea is  evidently reverence and sincerity.    Why did the Hebrew law-givers place these three laws, which  emphasize absolute loyalty to Jehovah, at the beginning of the  decalogue?  What do we mean to-day by loyalty to God?  Loyalty to  Jehovah was not only the corner stone of Israel's religion but also  of the Hebrew state.  During the wilderness period and far down  into later periods it was the chief and at times practically the  only bond that bound together the individual members of the tribe  and nation.  Disloyalty to Jehovah was treason, and even the mild  code found in the book of Deuteronomy directs that apostasy be  punished by public stoning.  Loyalty to God or at least to the  individual sense of right to-day as in the past is the first  essential of effective citizenship.  Which is the more essential  for the welfare of the state, the manual, the mental or the  religious training of its citizens?  Where is the chief emphasis  placed to-day?  Is this right?      III.    THE SOCIAL AND ETHICAL BASIS OF THE SABBATH LAW.    The institution of the Sabbath in different countries apparently  has a long and complex history.  Many explanations have been given  of its origin, aside from the direct divine command.  The simplest  and most satisfactory is probably that it was originally connected  with the worship of the moon.  There are many indications in Hebrew  history that the early ancestors of the Israelites were moon  worshippers.  To-day as in the distant past the inhabitants of the  deserts from whence came the forefathers of the Hebrews make their  journeys under the clear, cool light of the moon, avoiding the hot,  piercing rays of the mid-day sun.  The moon with its marvelous  transformations is unquestionably the most striking and  awe-inspiring object in the heavens.  It is not strange, therefore,  that many primitive peoples and especially the nomadic desert  dwellers worshipped it as the supreme embodiment of beauty and  power.    In China feast days once a month were doubtless connected with the  phases of the moon.  Among the American Indians time was reckoned  by numbers of moons.  The custom of observing as sacred the four  days, which marked the transition from one quarter of the moon to  another, was also widespread.  In the Hebrew religion the feast of  the New Moon was closely identified with that of the Sabbath.  The  Hebrew month was also the lunar month of approximately twenty-eight  days.  The new moon, therefore, marked the beginning of the month  and each succeeding Sabbath a new phase of the moon.  The fourth  commandment seems, therefore, like the others to have a basis in  nature, and also, as we shall note, a social reason.  Would a  commandment be truly divine if it did not have a natural and  reasonable basis?  By the ancients rest from labor was regarded as  one of the essential elements in the sacred day.  The prophet Amos  denounced the merchants of Northern Israel because they were  constantly saying,      When shall the new moon pass that we may sell grain,    And the Sabbath that we may open the corn?    In its earlier ceremonial interpretation, to abstain from all labor  on the Sabbath was clearly regarded as a primary obligation.  Like  fasting, it is probably regarded as an offering due to Jehovah.  The word \"holy\" in the Hebrew means set apart, distinct.  The  Sabbath, therefore, was to differ from the other days of the week.  The great ethical prophets of the Assyrian period were the first  completely to divest this ancient institution of its heathen  significance and give it a deeper religious, and therefore social  and humanitarian interpretation.  They gave it its true and eternal  content, declaring that God decreed that all who labor should have  their needed rest.  The prophet who added the noble interpretation  in Deuteronomy 5:14, 15, declares that it was not only that old and  young, master and slave, might rest, but also that even the toiling  ox and ass and the resident alien might have the relaxation which  their tired bodies required.  Thus these inspired prophets traced  the ultimate basis of the institution of the Sabbath to God's  providence for the innate needs of man.  They recognized that it  was essential for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of  the individual and, therefore, for the welfare of the State.  That  the Hebrews might not forget this obligation, the prophets appealed  to the memory of the days when the Israelites themselves were  slaves in the land of Egypt and the thought of how Jehovah  delivered them from their slavery.    Tuan Fang, the great Manchu viceroy who only recently met martyrdom  at the hands of his warring countrymen, said when visiting America  a few years ago, \"I think that when I return to China I will  introduce Sunday in my province.\"  When asked whether he would make  it the seventh day, he replied, \"Yes, for I think that the seventh  day is far better than the tenth.  Furthermore, for the convenience  and economy of all, I will make it correspond to the Christian  Sunday.  From my study of the conditions in America and of the  needs in China I am convinced that the Sabbath is a most valuable  and essential institution.\"    Later Judaism revived the earlier heathen content of the Sabbath,  and lost sight of its deeper political, social and humanitarian  significance.  Unfortunately the Christian church and above all our  Puritan fathers followed the guidance of the later priests rather  than of the early prophets.  Jesus with his clear insight into  human hearts and needs, and with his glowing love for men,  repudiated the harsh, mechanical interpretation of the Sabbath  current in his day and reasserted the teachings of the great  prophets that preceded him; \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man  for the Sabbath.\"    Does the social and humanitarian interpretation of the Sabbath  obscure or deepen its religious significance?  Does the great body  of the Christian church to-day accept the interpretation of the  prophets and of Jesus, or that of early heathenism and later  Judaism?  Does the interpretation of the prophets and of Jesus  furnish a basis on which all classes in the state can unite in  appreciating and in jealously guarding the Sabbath?  Does the  acceptance of one or the other of these interpretations  fundamentally affect our actual observance of the Sabbath?  Our  motives and our spirit?  Our attitude toward our fellow men?      IV.    IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN'S LOYALTY TO PARENTS    It is generally recognized by scientists that the place of animals  in the scale of being is dependent upon the length of their period  of infancy."]]]
