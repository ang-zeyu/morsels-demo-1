The Lady Violetta prefers violets, Your Majesty.    POMPDEBILE. Let there be a few violets put in with the  roses--er--We are ready for the ceremony to commence. We confess  to a slight nervousness unbecoming to one of our station. The  Lady Violetta, though trying at times, we have found--er--shall  we say--er--satisfying?    KNAVE (_bowing_). Intoxicating, Your Majesty?    CHANCELLOR (_shortly_). His Majesty means nothing of the sort.    POMPDEBILE. No, of course not--er--The mule--Is that--did you--?    CHANCELLOR (_in a grieved tone_). This is hardly necessary. Have I  ever neglected or forgotten any of your commands, Your Majesty?    POMPDEBILE. You have, often. However, don't be insulted. It takes  a great deal of our time and it is most uninteresting.    CHANCELLOR (_indignantly_). I resign, Your Majesty.    POMPDEBILE. Your thirty-seventh resignation will be accepted  to-morrow. Just now it is our wish to begin at once. The anxiety  that no doubt gathered in the breast of each of the seven  successive Pompdebiles before us seems to have concentrated in  ours. Already the people are clamoring at the gates of the palace  to know the decision. Begin. Let the Pages be summoned.    KNAVE (_bowing_). Beg pardon, Your Majesty; before summoning the  Pages, should not the Lady Violetta be here?    POMPDEBILE. She should, and is, we presume, on the other side of  that door--waiting breathlessly.    (THE KNAVE _quietly opens the door and closes it._)    KNAVE (_bowing_). She is not, Your Majesty, on the other side of  that door waiting breathlessly. In fact, to speak plainly, she is  not on the other side of that door at all.    POMPDEBILE. Can that be true? Where are her ladies?    KNAVE. They are all there, Your Majesty.    POMPDEBILE. Summon one of them.    (THE KNAVE _goes out, shutting the door. He returns, following_  URSULA, _who, very much frightened, throws herself at the_ KING'S  _feet._)    POMPDEBILE. Where is your mistress?    URSULA. She has gone, Your Majesty.    POMPDEBILE. Gone! Where has she gone?    URSULA. I do not know, Your Majesty. She was with us a while ago,  waiting there, as you commanded.    POMPDEBILE. Yes, and then--speak.    URSULA. Then she started out and forbade us to go with her.    POMPDEBILE. The thought of possible divorce from us was more than  she could bear. Did she say anything before she left?    URSULA (_trembling_). Yes, Your Majesty.    POMPDEBILE. What was it? She may have gone to self-destruction.  What was it?    URSULA. She said--    POMPDEBILE. Speak, woman, speak.    URSULA. She said that Your Majesty--    POMPDEBILE. A farewell message! Go on.    URSULA (_gasping_). That Your Majesty was \"pokey\" and that she  didn't intend to stay there any longer.    POMPDEBILE (_roaring_). _Pokey!!_    URSULA. Yes, Your Majesty, and she bade me call her when you  came, but we can't find her, Your Majesty.    (_The_ PASTRY COOKS _whisper._ URSULA _is in tears._)    CHANCELLOR. This should not be countenanced, Your Majesty. The  word \"pokey\" cannot be found in the dictionary. It is the most  flagrant disrespect to use a word that is not in the dictionary  in connection with a king.    POMPDEBILE. We are quite aware of that, Chancellor, and although  we may appear calm on the surface, inwardly we are swelling,  _swelling_, with rage and indignation.    KNAVE (_looking out the window_). I see the Lady Violetta in the  garden. (_He goes to the door and holds it open, bowing._) The Lady  Violetta is at the door, Your Majesty.    (_Enter the_ LADY VIOLETTA, _her purple train over her arm. She has  been running._)    VIOLETTA. Am I late? I just remembered and came as fast as I  could. I bumped into a sentry and he fell down. I didn't. That's  strange, isn't it? I suppose it's because he stands in one  position so long he--Why, Pompy dear, what's the matter? Oh, oh!  (_Walking closer_) Your feelings are hurt!    POMPDEBILE. _Don't_ call us Pompy. It doesn't seem to matter  to you whether you are divorced or not.    VIOLETTA (_anxiously_). Is that why your feelings are hurt?    POMPDEBILE. Our feelings are not hurt, not at all.    VIOLETTA. Oh, yes, they are, Pompdebile dear. I know, because  they are connected with your eyebrows. When your feelings go  down, up go your eyebrows, and when your feelings go up, they go  down--always.    POMPDEBILE (_severely_). Where have you been?    VIOLETTA. I, just now?    POMPDEBILE. Just now, when you should have been outside that door  waiting _breathlessly._    VIOLETTA. I was in the garden. Really, Pompy, you couldn't expect  me to stay all day in that ridiculous pantry; and as for being  breathless, it's quite impossible to be it unless one has been  jumping or something.    POMPDEBILE. What were you doing in the garden?    VIOLETTA (_laughing_). Oh, it was too funny. I must tell you. I  found a goat there who had a beard just like the Chancellor's--really  it was quite remarkable, the resemblance--in other ways too. I  took him by the horns and I looked deep into his eyes, and I  said, \"Chancellor, if you try to influence Pompy--\"    POMPDEBILE (_shouting_). Don't call us Pompy.    VIOLETTA. Excuse me, Pomp--    (_Checking herself._)    KNAVE. And yet I think I remember hearing of an emperor, a great  emperor, named Pompey.    POMPDEBILE. We know him not. Begin at once; the people are  clamoring at the gates. Bring the ingredients.    (_The_ PASTRY COOKS _open the door, and, single file, six little  boys march in, bearing large jars labeled butter, salt, flour,  pepper, cinnamon, and milk. The_ COOKS _place a table and a large  bowl and a pan in front of the_ LADY VIOLETTA _and give her a  spoon. The six little boys stand three on each side._)    VIOLETTA. Oh, what darling little ingredients. May I have an  apron, please?    (URSULA _puts a silk apron, embroidered with red hearts, on the_  LADY VIOLETTA.)    BLUE HOSE. We were unable to find a little boy to carry the  pepper, My Lady. They all _would_ sneeze in such a disturbing  way.    VIOLETTA. This is a perfectly controlled little boy. He hasn't  sneezed once.    YELLOW HOSE. That, if it please Your Ladyship, is not a little  boy.    VIOLETTA. Oh! How nice! Perhaps she will help me.    CHANCELLOR (_severely_). You are allowed no help, Lady Violetta.    VIOLETTA. Oh, Chancellor, how cruel of you. (_She takes up the  spoon, bowing._) Your Majesty, Lords and Ladies of the court, I  propose to make (_impressively_) raspberry tarts.    BLUE HOSE. Heaven be kind to us!    YELLOW HOSE (_suddenly agitated_). Your Majesty, I implore your  forgiveness. There is no raspberry jam in the palace.    POMPDEBILE What! Who is responsible for this carelessness?    BLUE HOSE. I gave the order to the grocer, but it didn't come.  (_Aside_) I knew something like this would happen. I knew it.    VIOLETTA (_untying her apron_). Then, Pompdebile, I'm very  sorry--we shall have to postpone it.    CHANCELLOR. If I may be allowed to suggest, Lady Violetta can  prepare something else.    KNAVE. The law distinctly says that the Queen-elect has the  privilege of choosing the dish which she prefers to prepare.    VIOLETTA. Dear Pompdebile, let's give it up. It's such a silly  law! Why should a great splendid ruler like you follow it just  because one of your ancestors, who wasn't half as nice as you  are, or one bit wiser, said to do it? Dearest Pompdebile, please.    POMPDEBILE. We are inclined to think that there may be something  in what the Lady Violetta says.    CHANCELLOR. I can no longer remain silent. It is due to that  brilliant law of Pompdebile the First, justly called the Great,  that all members of our male sex are well fed, and, as a natural  consequence, happy.    KNAVE. The happiness of a set of moles who never knew the  sunlight.    POMPDEBILE. If we made an effort, we could think of a new  law--just as wise. It only requires effort.    CHANCELLOR. But the constitution. We can't touch the  constitution.    POMPDEBILE (_starting up_). We shall destroy the constitution!    CHANCELLOR. The people are clamoring at the gates!    POMPDEBILE. Oh, I forgot them. No, it has been carried too far.  We shall have to go on. Proceed.    VIOLETTA. Without the raspberry jam?    POMPDEBILE (_to_ KNAVE). Go you, and procure some. I will give a  hundred golden guineas for it.    (_The little boy who holds the cinnamon pot comes forward._)    BOY. Please, Your Majesty, I have some.    POMPDEBILE. You! Where?    BOY. In my pocket. If someone would please hold my cinnamon  jar--I could get it.    (UBSULA _takes it. The boy struggles with his pocket and finally,  triumphantly, pulls out a small jar._)    There!    VIOLETTA. How clever of you! Do you always do that?    BOY. What--eat raspberry jam?    VIOLETTA. No, supply the exact article needed from your pocket.    BOY. I eat it for my lunch. Please give me the hundred guineas.    VIOLETTA. Oh, yes--Chancellor--if I may trouble you.    (_Holding out her hand._)    CHANCELLOR. Your Majesty, this is an outrage! Are you going to  allow this?    POMPDEBILE (_sadly_). Yes, Chancellor. We have such an impulsive  nature!    (_The_ LADY VIOLETTA _receives the money._)    VIOLETTA. Thank you. (_She gives it to the boy._) Now we are ready  to begin. Milk, please. (_The boy who holds the milk jar comes  forward and kneels._) I take some of this milk and beat it well.    YELLOW HOSE (_in a whisper_). _Beat_ it--milk!    VIOLETTA. Then I put in two tablespoonfuls of salt, taking great  care that it falls exactly in the middle of the bowl. (_To the  little boy_) Thank you, dear. Now the flour, no, the pepper, and  then--one pound of butter. I hope that it is good butter, or the  whole thing will be quite spoiled.    BLUE HOSE. This is the most astonishing thing I have ever  witnessed.    YELLOW HOSE. I don't understand it.    VIOLETTA (_stirring_). I find that the butter is _not_ very  good."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#20)"],[1,"be quite worn off, yet not to be sower, but  vinous. You may drink it at meals instead of wine, and is wholesomer and  better then wine.    To small Meath, that is to be drunk presently, you may put a little Ginger  to give it life, and work it with a little barm. If the Meath work not at  all, it will nevertheless be good, and peradventure better than that which  worketh; but it will be longer first, and the dregs will fall down to the  bottom, though it work not.    Small Meath of eight or nine parts of water to one of honey, will be very  good, though it never work, but be barrell'd up as soon as it is cold, and  stopped close: and after two or three months drunk from the barrel without  botteling. This is good for Meals.      TO MAKE WHITE MEATH    Take to every three Gallons of water, one Gallon of honey and set the water  over the fire, and let the honey melt, before the water be too hot; then  put in a New-laid-egg, and feel with your hand; if it comes half way the  water, it is strong enough; Then put into it these Herbs, Thyme,  Sweet-marjoram, Winter-savoury, Sweet-bryar, and Bay-leaves, in all a good  great handful; which a proportion for ten Gallons; Then with a quick-fire  boil it very fast half an hour, and no longer; and then take it from the  fire, and let it cool in two or three woodden vessels; and let it stand  without stirring twenty four hours. Then softly drain it out, leaving all  the dregs behind. Put the clear into your vessel; and if you like any  spice, take Ginger, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Mace and Cloves, and bruise them a  little, and put them in a bag, and let them hang in your vessel. Before you  put your Meath into the vessel, try if it will bear an Egg as broad as a  peny; if it do, then it is very well; and if it be made with the best  White-honey, it usually is just so. But if it should prove too strong, that  it bears the Egge broader; then boil a little more honey and water very  small, and put to it, when it is cold: and then put it into the vessel. It  is best to be made at Michaelmas, and not drunk of till Lent.      TO MAKE SMALL WHITE MEATH    Take of the best white honey six quarts; of Springwater sixteen Gallons;  set it on a gentle fire at first, tell it is melted, and clean skimmed;  then make it boil apace, until the third part be consumed. Then take it  from the fire, and put it in a cooler, and when it is cold, Tun it up, and  let it stand eight months, before you drink it. When you take it from the  fire, slice in three Orris-roots, and let it remain in the Liquor, when you  Tun it up.      A RECEIPT TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take four Gallons of water, two quarts of Honey, two ounces of Ginger, one  ounce of Nutmegs, a good handful of Rose-mary tops, and as much of  Bay-leaves, two ounces of dried Orange-peel. Boil all these till it be so  strong as will bear an Egg, and not sink; when it is milk warm, work it up  with barm, during twenty four hours, and then barrel it up. And after three  months you may bottle it up at your pleasure.    As you desire a greater quantity of the drink, you must augment the  ingredients, according to the proportions above recited.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take four Gallons of water and one of Honey; boil and skim it: then put  into it, Liverwort, Harts-tongue, Wild-carrot, and Yarrow, a little  Rosemary and Bays, one Parsly-root, and a Fennel-root; let them boil an  hour altogether. You may, if you please, hang a little bag of spice in it.  When it is cold, put a little barm to it, and let it work like Beer. The  roots must be scraped, and the Pith taken out.      MEATH FROM THE MUSCOVIAN AMBASSADOUR'S STEWARD    Take three times as much water as honey; then let the tubs, that the honey  must be wrought in, be cleansed very clean with scalding water, so that it  may not prove sowre; also when you mix them together, take half-warm-water,  and half cold, and squeese them well together; Afterwards when you think  the honey is well melted, then let it run through a sieve; and see your  kettle of Copper or Iron (but Copper is better than Iron) be very clean;  then put in your spice, as, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cloves, Cardamome, Anisseeds,  Orange peel; put these in according to the quantity you make, and let them  all be bruised, except the Orange peel, which leave whole. The Meath must  boil an hour by the Clock; after put it into Tubs to cool, and when it is  cold, take three or four slices of White-bread, tost them very hard, and  spread very good yest on both sides of the tosts; then put them into the  Tubs. If it be warm weather, let the Tubs be uncovered; but if it be cold,  cover them. This being done, you will find it worked enough by the black  that cometh up by the sides of the Tubs; then take a sieve and take off the  yest and bread. Afterwards draw it off at a tap in the Tub into the cask  you intend to keep it in; then take a quantity of spice as before,  well-bruised, and put it into a bag, and make it fast at the bung, with a  string, and if it begins to work, after it is in the cask, be sure to give  it vent, or else you will loose all.      TO MAKE MEATH    To every quart of honey put four quarts of Springwater; temper the honey in  the water, being a little warmed; then put it on the fire again, with  Fennel, Rose-mary, Thyme, Agrimony, Parsley or the like. Let them boil half  an hour, and upwards; and as it boileth, scum the froth; Then take it off,  and strain it, and let it cool as you do your wort. Then put a little barm  into it, then take off the froath again, and stir it well together. Then  take two quarts of Ale, boiled with Cloves. Mace, Cinnamon, Ginger and  Liquorice; and put it to the Meath and Tun it up.      A RECEIPT TO MAKE WHITE MEATH    Take Rose-mary, Thyme, Sweet-bryar, Peny-royal, Bays, Water-cresses,  Agrimony, Marsh-mallow-leaves and flowers, Liver-wort, Maiden-hair, Betony,  Eye-bright, Scabious, the bark of an Ash-tree, young Eringo-roots,  Wild-Angelica, Ribwort, Sinacle, Roman-worm-wood, Tamarisk, Mother-thyme,  Saxafrage, Philipendula, of each of these herbs a like proportion; or of as  many as you please to put in. You must put in all but four handfuls of  herbs, which you must steep a night and a day, in a little bowl of water,  being close covered. The next day take another fresh quantity of water, and  boil the same herbs in it, till the colour be very high; then take another  quantity of water, and boil the same herbs in it, untill it look green; and  so let them boil three or four times in several waters, as long as the  Liquor looketh anything green. Then let it stand with these herbs in it a  day and a night. Remember the last water you boil it in, to this proportion  of herbs, must be eighteen Gallons. And when it hath stood a day and a  night with these herbs in it after the last boiling, then strain the Liquor  from the herbs; and put as much of the finest and best honey into the  Liquor, as will bear an Egg; you must work the honey and liquor together a  whole day, until the honey be consumed; then let it stand one whole night;  then let it be well laboured again, and set it a clearing; and so boil it  again with the whites of six New-laid-eggs with the shells; skim it very  clean; and let it stand a day a cooling; then put it into a barrel, and  take Cloves, Mace, Cinnamon and Nutmegs as much as will please your taste,  and beat them all together, and put them in a Linnen bag, and hang it with  a thread into the barrel. Then take the whites of two or three  New-laid-eggs, a spoonful of barm, a spoonful of Wheat-flower, and beat  them all together, and put it into your Liquor in the barrel, and let it  work before you stop it; then afterwards stop it well, and set it in a cold  place, and when it hath been settled some six weeks: draw it into bottles,  and stop it very close, and drink not of it in a month after.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take eight Gallons of water, set it over a clear fire in a Kettle; and when  it is warm, put it to sixteen pounds of very good honey, and stir it well  together; take off the scum, and put two large Nutmegs cut in quarters, and  so let it boil at least an hour; Then take it off the fire, and put to it  two good handfulls of grinded Malt, and with a white staff keep beating it  together till it be almost cold; then strain it through a hair-sieve into a  Tub, and put to it a wine-pint of Ale-yest, and stir it very well together;  and when it is cold, you may if you please, Tun it up presently into a  vessel fit for it, or else let it stand, and work a day, and when it hath  done working in your vessel, stop it up very close. It will be three weeks  or a month before it be ready to drink.      TO MAKE HONEY DRINK    To two quarts of water take one pound of Honey. When it boileth, skim it  clean as long as any scum ariseth; boil it a pretty while; then take it off  the fire, and put it in an earthen pot, and let it stand till the next day;  then put it into clean bottles, that are throughly dry, rinsing first every  bottle with a little of the liquor; Fill them not too full, and put into  every bottle four or five Cloves, and four or five slices of Ginger: and  stop it very close, and set it in Sand; and within ten or twelve days it  will be ready to drink.    Some, when they take their Bees, put the honey-combs into fair-water, and  make it so strong of the honey that it will bear an Egg; and then boil it  with some Spice, and put it into a barrel: but I think it not so good, as  that which is made of pure honey.      THE EARL OF DENBIGH'S METHEGLIN    Take twenty Gallons of Spring-water; boil it a quarter of an hour, and let  it stand, until it be all most cold; then beat in so much honey, as will  make it so strong as to bear an Egg, so that on the Top, you may see the  breadth of a hasel-nut swimming above; The next day boil it up with six  small handfuls of Rosemary; a pound and a half of Ginger, being scraped and  bruised; then take the"]]]
