I wish it  to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub.[301] We  chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity. It is an exchange  of gifts, of useful loans; it is good neighborhood; it watches with  the sick; it holds the pall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of  the delicacies and nobility of the relation. But though we cannot find  the god under this disguise of a sutler, yet, on the other hand, we  cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine, and does not  substantiate his romance by the municipal virtues of justice,  punctuality, fidelity and pity. I hate the prostitution of the name of  friendship to signify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer the  company of plow-boys and tin-peddlers, to the silken and perfumed  amity which only celebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous  display, by rides in a curricle,[302] and dinners at the best taverns.  The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that  can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience. It is  for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and  death. It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country  rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty,  and persecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the  trances of religion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs  and offices of man's life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and  unity. It should never fall into something usual and settled, but  should be alert and inventive, and add rhyme and reason to what was  drudgery.    14. Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each  so well-tempered, and so happily adapted, and withal so  circumstanced, (for even in that particular, a poet says, love demands  that the parties be altogether paired,) that its satisfaction can very  seldom be assured. It cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of  those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more  than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I have  never known so high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination  more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each  other, and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this  law of _one to one_,[303] peremptory for conversation, which is the  practice and consummation of friendship. Do not mix waters too much.  The best mix as ill as good and bad. You shall have very useful and  cheering discourse at several times with two several men, but let all  three of you come together, and you shall not have one new and hearty  word. Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a  conversation of the most sincere and searching sort. In good company  there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes  place when you leave them alone. In good company, the individuals at  once merge their egotism into a social soul exactly co-extensive with  the several consciousnesses there present. No partialities of friend  to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are  there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can  sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly limited to  his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the  high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running  of two souls into one.    15. No two men but being left alone with each other, enter into  simpler relations. Yet it is affinity that determines _which_ two  shall converse. Unrelated men give little joy to each other; will  never suspect the latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great  talent for conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some  individuals. Conversation is an evanescent relation,--no more. A man  is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say  a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as  much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the  shade. In the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his  thought, he will regain his tongue.    16. Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and  unlikeness, that piques each with the presence of power and of consent  in the other party. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather  than that my friend should overstep by a word or a look his real  sympathy. I am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him  not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being  mine, is that the _not mine_ is _mine_. I hate, where I looked for a  manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of  concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend, than his  echo. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do  without it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There  must be very two before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance  of two large formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared,  before yet they recognize the deep identity which beneath these  disparities unites them.    17. He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure  that greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to  intermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this.  Leave to the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the  births of the eternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We  talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected. Reverence  is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he  has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor, if you must  needs hold him close to your person. Stand aside; give those merits  room; let them mount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend's  buttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will still be a  stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the  holiest ground. Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as  property, and to suck a short and all-confounding pleasure instead of  the noblest benefits.    18. Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why  should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them?  Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his  house, or know his mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by  him at your own? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this  touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought,  a sincerity, a glance from him I want, but not news, nor pottage. I  can get politics, and chat, and neighborly conveniences, from cheaper  companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure,  universal, and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is  profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the  horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us  not vilify but raise it to that standard. That great defying eye, that  scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on  reducing, but rather fortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities;  wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all. Guard him  as thy counterpart. Let him be to thee forever a sort of beautiful  enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a trivial conveniency to  be soon outgrown and cast aside. The hues of the opal, the light of  the diamond, are not to be seen, if the eye is too near. To my friend  I write a letter, and from him I receive a letter. That seems to you a  little. It suffices me. It is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give  and of me to receive. It profanes nobody. In these warm lines the  heart will trust itself, as it will not to the tongue, and pour out  the prophecy of a godlier existence than all the annals of heroism  have yet made good.    19. Respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to  prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience for its opening. We  must be our own before we can be another's. There is at least this  satisfaction in crime, according to the Latin proverb;--you can speak  to your accomplice on even terms. _Crimen quos[304] inquinat, aequat_.  To those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot. Yet the least  defect of self-possession vitiates, in my judgment, the entire  relation. There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never  mutual respect until, in their dialogue, each stands for the whole  world.    20. What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of  spirit we can. Let us be silent,--so we may hear the whisper of the  gods. Let us not interfere. Who set you to cast about what you should  say to the select souls, or how to say anything to such? No matter how  ingenious, no matter how graceful and bland. There are innumerable  degrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be  frivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait until the necessary  and everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves  of your lips. The only reward of virtue, is virtue; the only way to  have a friend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting  into his house. If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you,  and you shall catch never a true glance of his eye. We see the noble  afar off, and they repel us; why should we intrude? Late,--very  late,--we perceive that no arrangements, no introductions, no  consuetudes or habits of society, would be of any avail to establish  us in such relations with them as we desire,--but solely the uprise of  nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then shall we meet as  water with water; and if we should not meet them then, we shall not  want them, for we are already they.

There are traces in  Greek mythology of pre-Hellenic myths about dying harvest deities,  like Hyakinthos and Erigone, for instance, who appear to have been  mourned for. There is every possibility, therefore, that the Tammuz  ritual may have been attached to a harvest god of the pre-Hellenic  Greeks, who received at the same time the new name of Adonis. Osiris  of Egypt resembles Tammuz, but his Mesopotamian origin has not been  proved. It would appear probable that Tammuz, Attis, Osiris, and the  deities represented by Adonis and Diarmid were all developed from an  archaic god of fertility and vegetation, the central figure of a myth  which was not only as ancient as the knowledge and practice of  agriculture, but had existence even in the \"Hunting Period\". Traces of  the Tammuz-Osiris story in various forms are found all over the area  occupied by the Mediterranean or Brown race from Sumeria to the  British Isles. Apparently the original myth was connected with tree  and water worship and the worship of animals. Adonis sprang from a  tree; the body of Osiris was concealed in a tree which grew round the  sea-drifted chest in which he was concealed. Diarmid concealed himself  in a tree when pursued by Finn. The blood of Tammuz, Osiris, and  Adonis reddened the swollen rivers which fertilized the soil. Various  animals were associated with the harvest god, who appears to have been  manifested from time to time in different forms, for his spirit  pervaded all nature. In Egypt the soul of Osiris entered the Apis bull  or the ram of Mendes.    Tammuz in the hymns is called \"the pre-eminent steer of heaven\", and a  popular sacrifice was \"a white kid of the god Tammuz\", which, however,  might be substituted by a sucking pig. Osiris had also associations  with swine, and the Egyptians, according to Herodotus, sacrificed a  pig to him annually. When Set at full moon hunted the boar in the  Delta marshes, he probably hunted the boar form of Osiris, whose human  body had been recovered from the sacred tree by Isis. As the soul of  Bata, the hero of the Egyptian folk tale,[109] migrated from the  blossom to the bull, and the bull to the tree, so apparently did the  soul of Osiris pass from incarnation to incarnation. Set, the demon  slayer of the harvest god, had also a boar form; he was the black pig  who devoured the waning moon and blinded the Eye of Ra.    In his character as a long-lived patriarch, Tammuz, the King Daonus or  Daos of Berosus, reigned in Babylonia for 36,000 years. When he died,  he departed to Hades or the Abyss. Osiris, after reigning over the  Egyptians, became Judge of the Dead.    Tammuz of the Sumerian hymns, however, is the Adonis-like god who  lived on earth for a part of the year as the shepherd and  agriculturist so dearly beloved by the goddess Ishtar. Then he died so  that he might depart to the realm of Eresh-ki-gal (Persephone), queen  of Hades. According to one account, his death was caused by the fickle  Ishtar. When that goddess wooed Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, he  upbraided her, saying:        On Tammuz, the spouse of thy youth,      Thou didst lay affliction every year.                _King's Translation_.    References in the Sumerian hymns suggest that there also existed a  form of the legend which gave an account of the slaying of the young  god by someone else than Ishtar. The slayer may have been a Set-like  demon--perhaps Nin-shach, who appears to have symbolized the  destroying influence of the sun. He was a war deity, and his name,  Professor Pinches says, \"is conjectured to mean 'lord of the wild  boar'\". There is no direct evidence, however, to connect Tammuz's  slayer with the boar which killed Adonis. Ishtar's innocence is  emphasized by the fact that she mourned for her youthful lover,  crying:        Oh hero, my lord, ah me! I will say;      Food I eat not ... water I drink not ...      Because of the exalted one of the nether world, him of the        radiant face, yea radiant,      Of the exalted one of the nether world, him of the dove-like        voice, yea dove-like.[110]    The Phrygian Attis met his death, according to one legend, by  self-mutilation under a sacred tree. Another account sets forth,  however, that he was slain by a boar. The Greek Adonis was similarly  killed by a boar. This animal was a form of Ares (Mars), god of war  and tempest, who also loved Aphrodite (Ishtar). The Celtic Diarmid, in  his character as a love god, with lunar attributes, was slain by \"the  green boar\", which appears to have been one of the animals of a  ferocious Hag, an earth and air \"mother\" with various names. In one of  the many Fingalian stories the animal is        ... That venomous boar, and he so fierce,      That Grey Eyebrows had with her herd of swine.[111]    Diarmid had eloped with the wife of Finn-mac-Coul (Fingal), who, like  Ares, plotted to bring about his rival's death, and accordingly set  the young hero to hunt the boar. As a thunder god Finn carried a  hammer with which he smote his shield; the blows were heard in  Lochlann (Scandinavia). Diarmid, like Tammuz, the \"god of the tender  voice and shining eyes\", had much beauty. When he expired, Finn cried:        No maiden will raise her eye      Since the mould has gone over thy visage fair...      Blue without rashness in thine eye!      Passion and beauty behind thy curls!...      Oh, yesternight it was green the hillock,      Red is it this day with Diarmid's blood.[112]    Tammuz died with the dying vegetation, and Diarmid expired when the  hills apparently were assuming their purple tints.[113] The month of  Tammuz wailings was from 20th June till 20th July, when the heat and  dryness brought forth the demons of pestilence. The mourners chanted:        He has gone, he has gone to the bosom of the earth,      And the dead are numerous in the land....      Men are filled with sorrow: they stagger by day in gloom ...      In the month of thy year which brings not peace hast thou gone.      Thou hast gone on a journey that makes an end of thy people.    The following extract contains a reference to the slaying of the god:        The holy one of Ishtar, in the middle of the year the fields          languish...      The shepherd, the wise one, the man of sorrows, why have they      slain?...      In his temple, in his inhabited domain,      The child, lord of knowledge, abides no more...      In the meadows, verily, verily, the soul of life perishes.    There is wailing for Tammuz \"at the sacred cedar, where the mother  bore thee\", a reference which connects the god, like Adonis and  Osiris, with tree worship:        The wailing is for the herbs: the first lament is, \"they are not          produced\".      The wailing is for the grain, ears are not produced.      The wailing is for the habitations, for the flocks which bring          forth no more.      The wailing is for the perishing wedded ones; for the perishing      children; the dark-headed people create no more.    The wailing is also for the shrunken river, the parched meadows, the  fishpools, the cane brakes, the forests, the plains, the gardens, and  the palace, which all suffer because the god of fertility has  departed. The mourner cries:          How long shall the springing of verdure be restrained?        How long shall the putting forth of leaves be held back?    Whither went Tammuz? His destination has already been referred to as  \"the bosom of the earth\", and in the Assyrian version of the \"Descent  of Ishtar\" he dwells in \"the house of darkness\" among the dead, \"where  dust is their nourishment and their food mud\", and \"the light is never  seen\"--the gloomy Babylonian Hades. In one of the Sumerian hymns,  however, it is stated that Tammuz \"upon the flood was cast out\". The  reference may be to the submarine \"house of Ea\", or the Blessed Island  to which the Babylonian Noah was carried. In this Hades bloomed the  nether \"garden of Adonis\".    The following extract refers to the garden of Damu (Tammuz)[114]:--        Damu his youth therein slumbers ...      Among the garden flowers he slumbers; among the garden flowers      he is cast away ...      Among the tamarisks he slumbers, with woe he causes us to be      satiated.    Although Tammuz of the hymns was slain, he returned again from Hades.  Apparently he came back as a child. He is wailed for as \"child, Lord  Gishzida\", as well as \"my hero Damu\". In his lunar character the  Egyptian Osiris appeared each month as \"the child surpassingly  beautiful\"; the Osiris bull was also a child of the moon; \"it was  begotten\", says Plutarch, \"by a ray of generative light falling from  the moon\". When the bull of Attis was sacrificed his worshippers were  drenched with its blood, and were afterwards ceremonially fed with  milk, as they were supposed to have \"renewed their youth\" and become  children. The ancient Greek god Eros (Cupid) was represented as a  wanton boy or handsome youth. Another god of fertility, the Irish  Angus, who resembles Eros, is called \"the ever young\"; he slumbers  like Tammuz and awakes in the Spring.    Apparently it was believed that the child god, Tammuz, returned from  the earlier Sumerian Paradise of the Deep, and grew into full manhood  in a comparatively brief period, like Vyasa and other super-men of  Indian mythology. A couplet from a Tammuz hymn says tersely:        In his infancy in a sunken boat he lay.      In his manhood in the submerged grain he lay.[115]    The \"boat\" may be the \"chest\" in which Adonis was concealed by  Aphrodite when she confided him to the care of Persephone, queen of  Hades, who desired to retain the young god, but was compelled by Zeus  to send him back to the goddess of love and vegetation. The fact that  Ishtar descended to Hades in quest of Tammuz may perhaps explain the  symbolic references in hymns to mother goddesses being in sunken boats  also when"]]]
