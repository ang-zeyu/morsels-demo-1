They were expressed  in the phraseology of the time; a phraseology, it is true, sadly  lacking in consistency, clearness, and appropriateness, but the only  language then available for the description of such changes as those  which happen when metals are calcined. One might suppose that it must  always have sounded ridiculous to say that the weight of a thing can  be decreased by adding something to it, that part of a thing weighs  more than the whole of it. But the absurdity disappears if it can be  admitted that mass, which is measured by weight, may be a property  like colour, or taste, or smell; for the colour, taste, or smell of a  thing may certainly be made less by adding something else, and the  colour, taste, or smell of a thing may also be increased by adding  something else. If we did not know that what we call _quantity of  substance_ is measured by the property named _mass_, we might very  well accept the proposition that the entrance of phlogiston into a  substance decreases the quantity, hence the mass, and, therefore, the  weight, of the substance.    Although Stahl and his followers were emerging from the trammels of  alchemy, they were still bound by many of the conceptions of that  scheme of nature. We have learned, in previous chapters, that the  central idea of alchemy was expressed in the saying: \"Matter must be  deprived of its properties in order to draw out its soul.\" The  properties of substances are everything to the modern chemist--indeed,  such words as iron, copper, water, and gold are to him merely  convenient expressions for certain definable groups of properties--but  the phlogisteans regarded the properties of things, including mass, as  of secondary importance; they were still trying to get beneath the  properties of a thing, to its hypothetical essence, or substance.    Looking back, we cannot think of phlogiston as a substance, or as a  thing, in the modern meanings of these terms as they are used in  natural science. Nowadays we think, we are obliged to think, of the  sum of the quantities of all the things in the universe as unchanging,  and unchangeable by any agency whereof we have definite knowledge. The  meaning we give to the word _thing_ rests upon the acceptance of this  hypothesis. But the terms _substance_, _thing_, _properties_ were used  very vaguely a couple of centuries ago; and it would be truly absurd  to carry back to that time the meanings which we give to these terms  to-day, and then to brand as ridiculous the attempts of the men who  studied, then, the same problems which we study now, to express the  results of their study in generalisations which employed the terms in  question, in what seems to us a loose, vague, and inexact manner.    By asserting, and to some extent experimentally proving, the existence  of one principle in many apparently very different substances (or, as  would be said to-day, one property common to many substances), the  phlogistic theory acted as a very useful means for collecting, and  placing in a favourable position for closer inspection, many  substances which would probably have remained scattered and detached  from one another had this theory not been constructed. A single  assumption was made, that all combustible substances are alike in one  respect, namely, in containing combined fire, or phlogiston; by the  help of this assumption, the theory of phlogiston emphasised the  fundamental similarity between all processes of combustion. The theory  of phlogiston was extraordinarily simple, compared with the alchemical  vagaries which preceded it. Hoefer says, in his _Histoire de la  Chimie_, \"If it is true that simplicity is the distinctive character  of verity, never was a theory so true as that of Stahl.\"    The phlogistic theory did more than serve as a means for bringing  together many apparently disconnected facts. By concentrating the  attention of the students of material changes on one class of events,  and giving descriptions of these events without using either of the  four alchemical Elements, or the three Principles, Stahl, and those  who followed him, did an immense service to the advancement of clear  thinking about natural occurrences. The principle of phlogiston was  more tangible, and more readily used, than the Salt, Sulphur, and  Mercury of the alchemists; and to accustom people to speak of the  material substance which remained when a metal, or other combustible  substance, was calcined or burnt, as one of the _elements_ of the  thing which had been changed, prepared the way for the chemical  conception of an element as a definite substance with certain definite  properties.    In addition to these advantages, the phlogistic theory was based on  experiments, and led to experiments, the results of which proved that  the capacity to undergo combustion might be conveyed to an  incombustible substance, by causing it to react with some other  substance, itself combustible, under definite conditions. The theory  thus prepared the way for the representation of a chemical change as  an interaction between definite kinds of substances, marked by precise  alterations both of properties and composition.    The great fault of the theory of phlogiston, considered as a general  conception which brings many facts into one point of view, and leads  the way to new and exact knowledge, was its looseness, its  flexibility. It was very easy to make use of the theory in a broad and  general way; by stretching it here, and modifying it there, it seemed  to cover all the facts concerning combustion and calcination which  were discovered during two generations after the publication of  Stahl's books. But many of the subsidiary hypotheses which were  required to make the theory cover the new facts were contradictory, or  at any rate seemed to be contradictory, of the primary assumptions of  the theory. The addition of this ancillary machinery burdened the  mechanism of the theory, threw it out of order, and finally made it  unworkable. The phlogistic theory was destroyed by its own  cumbersomeness.    A scientific theory never lasts long if its fundamental assumptions  are stated so loosely that they may be easily modified, expanded,  contracted, and adjusted to meet the requirements of newly discovered  facts. It is true that the theories which have been of the greatest  service in science, as summaries of the relations between established  facts, and suggestions of lines of investigation, have been stated in  terms whose full meaning has gradually unfolded itself. But the  foundations of these theories have been at once so rigidly defined and  clearly stated as to be incapable of essential modification, and so  full of meaning and widely applicable as to cover large classes of  facts which were unknown when the theories were constructed. Of the  founders of the lasting and expansible theories of natural science, it  may be said, that \"thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards  were given.\"          CHAPTER XI.    THE EXAMINATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF COMBUSTION.      The alchemists thought that the most effectual method of separating a  complex substance into more simple substances was to subject it to the  action of heat. They were constantly distilling, incinerating,  subliming, heating, in order that the spirit, or inner kernel of  things, might be obtained. They took for granted that the action of  fire was to simplify, and that simplification proceeded whatever might  be the nature of the substance which was subjected to this action.  Boyle insisted that the effect of heating one substance may be, and  often is, essentially different from the effect of heating another  substance; and that the behaviour of the same substance when heated,  sometimes varies when the conditions are changed. He takes the example  of heating sulphur or brimstone: \"Exposed to a moderate fire in  subliming pots, it rises all into dry, and almost tasteless, flowers;  whereas being exposed to a naked fire, it affords store of a saline  and fretting liquor.\" Boyle thought that the action of fire was not  necessarily to separate a thing into its principles or elements, but,  in most cases, was either to rearrange the parts of the thing, so that  new, and it might be, more complex things, were produced, or to form  less simple things by the union of the substance with what he called,  \"the matter of fire.\" When the product of heating a substance, for  example, tin or lead, weighed more than the substance itself, Boyle  supposed that the gain in weight was often caused by the \"matter of  fire\" adding itself to the substance which was heated. He commended to  the investigation of philosophers this \"subtil fluid,\" which is \"able  to pierce into the compact and solid bodies of metals, and add  something to them that has no despicable weight upon the balance, and  is able for a considerable time to continue fixed in the fire.\" Boyle  also drew attention to the possibility of action taking place between  a substance which is heated and some other substance, wherewith the  original thing may have been mixed. In a word, Boyle showed that the  alchemical assumption--fire simplifies--was too simple; and he taught,  by precept and example, that the only way of discovering what the  action of fire is, on this substance or on that, is to make accurate  experiments. \"I consider,\" he says, \"that, generally speaking, to  render a reason of an effect or phenomenon, is to deduce it from  something else in nature more known than itself; and that consequently  there may be divers kinds of degrees of explication of the same  thing.\"    Boyle published his experiments and opinions concerning the action of  fire on different substances in the seventies of the 17th century;  Stahl's books, which laid the foundation of the phlogistic theory, and  confirmed the alchemical opinion that the action of fire is  essentially a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"he met his shepherd as he was going to the fold.    \"Welcome home, Lord Abbot,\" quoth the shepherd; \"what news from good  King John?\"    \"Sad news, sad news, my shepherd,\" said the Abbot, and told him all that  had happened.    \"Now, cheer up, Sir Abbot,\" said the shepherd. \"A fool may perhaps  answer what a wise man knows not. I will go to London in your stead;  grant me only your apparel and your retinue of knights. At the least I  can die in your place.\"    \"Nay, shepherd, not so,\" said the Abbot; \"I must meet the danger in my  own person. And to that, thou canst not pass for me.\"    \"But I can and I will, Sir Abbot. In a cowl, who will know me for what I  am?\"    So at last the Abbot consented, and sent him to London in his most  splendid array, and he approached King John with all his retinue as  before, but dressed in his simple monk's dress and his cowl over his  face.    \"Now welcome, Sir Abbot,\" said King John; \"thou art prepared for thy  doom, I see.\"    \"I am ready to answer your Majesty,\" said he.    \"Well, then, question first--where is the centre of the round earth?\"  said the King.    \"Here,\" said the shepherd Abbot, planting his crozier in the ground;  \"an' your Majesty believe me not, go measure it and see.\"    \"By St. Botolph,\" said the King, \"a merry answer and a shrewd; so to  question the second. How soon may I ride this round world about?\"    \"If your Majesty will graciously rise with the sun, and ride along with  him until the next morning he rise, your Grace will surely have ridden  it round.\"    \"By St. John,\" laughed King John, \"I did not think it could be done so  soon. But let that pass, and tell me question third and last, and that  is--What do I think?\"    \"That is easy, your Grace,\" said he. \"Your Majesty thinks I am my lord  the Abbot of Canterbury; but as you may see,\" and here he raised his  cowl, \"I am but his poor shepherd, that am come to ask your pardon for  him and for me.\"    Loud laughed the King. \"Well caught. Thou hast more wit than thy lord,  and thou shalt be Abbot in his place.\"    \"Nay, that cannot be,\" quoth the shepherd; \"I know not to write nor to  read.\"    \"Well, then, four nobles a week thou shalt have for the ready wit. And  tell the Abbot from me that he has my pardon.\" And with that King John  sent away the shepherd with a right royal present, besides his pension.          Rushen Coatie      There was once a king and a queen, as many a one has been; few have we  seen, and as few may we see. But the queen died, leaving only one bonny  girl, and she told her on her death-bed: \"My dear, after I am gone,  there will come to you a little red calf, and whenever you want  anything, speak to it, and it will give it you.\"    Now, after a while, the king married again an ill-natured wife, with  three ugly daughters of her own. And they hated the king's daughter  because she was so bonny. So they took all her fine clothes away from  her, and gave her only a coat made of rushes. So they called her Rushen  Coatie, and made her sit in the kitchen nook, amid the ashes. And when  dinner-time came, the nasty stepmother sent her out a thimbleful of  broth, a grain of barley, a thread of meat, and a crumb of bread. But  when she had eaten all this, she was just as hungry as before, so she  said to herself: \"Oh! how I wish I had something to eat.\" Just then, who  should come in but a little red calf, and said to her: \"Put your finger  into my left ear.\" She did so, and found some nice bread. Then the calf  told her to put her finger into its right ear, and she found there some  cheese, and made a right good meal of the bread and cheese. And so it  went on from day to day.    Now the king's wife thought Rushen Coatie would soon die from the scanty  food she got, and she was surprised to see her as lively and healthy as  ever. So she set one of her ugly daughters on the watch at meal times to  find out how Rushen Coatie got enough to live on. The daughter soon  found out that the red calf gave food to Rushen Coatie, and told her  mother. So her mother went to the king and told him she was longing to  have a sweetbread from a red calf. Then the king sent for his butcher,  and had the little red calf killed. And when Rushen Coatie heard of it,  she sate down and wept by its side, but the dead calf said:         \"Take me up, bone by bone,        And put me beneath yon grey stone;        When there is aught you want        Tell it me, and that I'll grant.\"    So she did so, but could not find the shank-bone of the calf.    Now the very next Sunday was Yuletide, and all the folk were going to  church in their best clothes, so Rushen Coatie said: \"Oh! I should like  to go to church, too,\" but the three ugly sisters said: \"What would you  do at the church, you nasty thing? You must bide at home and make the  dinner.\" And the king's wife said: \"And this is what you must make the  soup of, a thimbleful of water, a grain of barley, and a crumb of  bread.\"    When they all went to church, Rushen Coatie sat down and wept, but  looking up, who should she see coming in limping, lamping, with a shank  wanting, but the dear red calf? And the red calf said to her: \"Do not  sit there weeping, but go, put on these clothes, and above all, put on  this pair of glass slippers, and go your way to church.\"    \"But what will become of the dinner?\" said Rushen Coatie.    \"Oh, do not fash about that,\" said the red calf, \"all you have to do is  to say to the fire:         \"'Every peat make t'other burn,         Every spit make t'other turn,         Every pot make t'other play,         Till I come from church this good Yuleday,'    and be off to church with you. But mind you come home first.\"    So Rushen Coatie said this, and went off to church, and she was the  grandest and finest lady there. There happened to be a young prince  there, and he fell at once in love with her. But she came away before  service was over, and was home before the rest, and had off her fine  clothes and on with her rushen coatie, and she found the calf had  covered the table, and the dinner was ready, and everything was in good  order when the rest came home. The three sisters said to Rushen Coatie:  \"Eh, lassie, if you had seen the bonny fine lady in church to-day, that  the young prince fell in love with!\" Then she said: \"Oh! I wish you  would let me go with you to the church to-morrow,\" for they used to go  three days together to church at Yuletide.    But they said: \"What should the like of you do at church, nasty thing?  The kitchen nook is good enough for you.\"    So the next day they all went to church, and Rushen Coatie was left  behind, to make dinner out of a thimbleful of water, a grain of barley,  a crumb of bread, and a thread of meat. But the red calf came to her  help again, gave her finer clothes than before, and she went to church,  where all the world was looking at her, and wondering where such a grand  lady came from, and the prince fell more in love with her than ever, and  tried to find out where she went to. But she was too quick for him, and  got home long before the rest, and the red calf had the dinner all  ready.    The next day the calf dressed her in even grander clothes than before,  and she went to the church. And the young prince was there again, and  this time he put a guard at the door to keep her, but she took a hop and  a run and jumped over their heads, and as she did so, down fell one of  her glass slippers. She didn't wait to pick it up, you may be sure, but  off she ran home, as fast as she could go, on with the rushen coatie,  and the calf had all things ready.    Then the young prince put out a proclamation that whoever could put on  the glass slipper should be his bride. All the ladies of his court went  and tried to put on the slipper. And they tried and tried and tried, but  it was too small for them all. Then he ordered one of his ambassadors to  mount a fleet horse and ride through the kingdom and find an owner for  the glass shoe. He rode and he rode to town and castle, and made all the  ladies try to put on the shoe. Many a one tried to get it on that she  might be the prince's bride. But no, it wouldn't do, and many a one  wept, I warrant, because she couldn't get on the bonny glass shoe. The  ambassador rode on and on till he came at the very last to the house  where there were the three ugly sisters. The first two tried it and it  wouldn't do, and the queen, mad with spite, hacked off the toes and  heels of the third sister, and she could then put the slipper on, and  the prince was brought to marry her, for he had to keep his promise. The  ugly sister was dressed all in her best and was put up behind the prince  on horseback, and off they rode in great gallantry. But ye all know,  pride must have a fall, for as they rode along a raven sang out of a  bush--         \"Hacked Heels and Pinched Toes        Behind the young prince rides,        But Pretty Feet and Little Feet        Behind the cauldron bides.\"    \"What's that the birdie sings?\" said the young prince.    \"Nasty, lying thing,\" said the step-sister, \"never mind what it says.\"    But the prince looked down and saw the slipper dripping with blood, so  he rode back and put her down. Then he said, \"There must be some one  that the slipper has not been tried on.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said they, \"there's none but a dirty thing that sits in the  kitchen nook and wears a rushen coatie.\"    But the prince was determined to try it on Rushen Coatie, but she ran  away to the grey stone, where the red calf dressed her in her bravest  dress, and she went to the prince and the slipper jumped out of his  pocket on to her foot, fitting her without any chipping or paring. So  the prince married her that very day, and they lived happy ever after.
