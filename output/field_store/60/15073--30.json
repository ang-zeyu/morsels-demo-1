Profound silence always reigned around her; she had no cat--that  cherished society of old women--not even a sparrow came to rest under  her roof. It seemed as if all animated nature shrank from her glance.  The bloated spider alone took delight in her society.    I cannot now conceive how my patience could endure those long hours of  observation: nothing escaped me; nothing was matter of indifference. At  the slightest sound I raised my slate; my curiosity was without limit,  insatiable.    Toubac complained greatly.    \"Master Christian,\" said he, \"how in the devil do you pass your time?  Formerly you painted something for me every week; now you do not finish  a piece once a month. Oh, you painters! 'Lazy as a painter' is a good,  wise proverb. As soon as you have a few kreutzers in possession, you  put your hands in your pockets and go to sleep!\"    I confess that I began to lose courage--I had watched, spied, and  discovered nothing. I said to myself that the old woman could not be  so dangerous as I had supposed; that I had perhaps done her injustice  by my suspicions; in short, I began to make excuses for her. One  lovely afternoon, with my eye fixed at my post of observation, I  abandoned myself to these benevolent reflections, when suddenly the  scene changed: Fledermausse passed through the gallery with the  rapidity of lightning. She was no longer the same person; she was  erect, her jaws were clinched, her glance fixed, her neck extended;  she walked with grand strides, her gray locks floating behind her.    \"Oh, at last,\" I said to myself, \"something is coming, attention!\" But,  alas! the shadows of evening descended upon the old building, the  noises of the city expired, and silence prevailed.    Fatigued and disappointed, I lay down upon my bed, when, casting my  eyes toward my dormer window, I saw the room opposite illuminated. So!  a traveler occupied the Green Room--fatal to strangers.    Now, all my fears were reawakened; the agitation of Fledermausse was  explained--she scented a new victim.    No sleep for me that night; the rustling of the straw, the nibbling of  the mice under the floor, gave me nervous chills.    I rose and leaned out of my window; I listened. The light in the room  opposite was extinguished. In one of those moments of poignant anxiety,  I cannot say if it was illusion or reality, I thought I saw the old  wretch also watching and listening.    The night passed, and the gray dawn came to my windows; by degrees the  noise and movements in the street ascended to my loft. Harassed by  fatigue and emotion I fell asleep, but my slumber was short, and by  eight o'clock I had resumed my post of observation.    It seemed as if the night had been as disturbed and tempestuous to  Fledermausse as to myself. When she opened the door of the gallery, I  saw that a livid pallor covered her cheeks and thin throat; she had on  only her chemise and a woolen skirt; a few locks of reddish gray hair  fell on her shoulders. She looked toward my hiding place with a dreamy,  abstracted air, but she saw nothing; she was thinking of other things.    Suddenly she descended, leaving her old shoes at the bottom of the  steps. \"Without doubt,\" thought I, \"she is going to see if the door  below is well fastened.\"    I saw her remount hastily, springing up three or four steps at a  time--it was terrible.    She rushed into the neighboring chamber, and I heard something like the  falling of the top of a great chest; then Fledermausse appeared in the  gallery, dragging a manikin after her, and this manikin was clothed  like the Heidelberg student.    With surprising dexterity the old woman suspended this hideous object  to a beam of the shed, then descended rapidly to the courtyard to  contemplate it. A burst of sardonic laughter escaped from her lips; she  remounted, then descended again like a maniac, and each time uttered  new cries and new bursts of laughter.    A noise was heard near the door, and the old woman bounded forward,  unhooked the manikin and carried it off; then, leaning over the  balustrade with her throat elongated, her eyes flashing, she listened  earnestly. The noise was lost in the distance, the muscles of her face  relaxed, and she drew long breaths. It was only a carriage which had  passed.    The old wretch had been frightened.    She now returned to the room, and I heard the chest close. This strange  scene confounded all my ideas. What did this manikin signify? I became  more than ever attentive.    Fledermausse now left the house with her basket on her arm. I followed  her with my eyes till she turned the corner of the street. She had  reassumed the air of a trembling old woman, took short steps, and from  time to time turned her head partly around, to peer behind from the  corner of her eye.    Fledermausse was absent fully five hours. For myself, I went, I came, I  meditated. The time seemed insupportable. The sun heated the slate of  the roof, and scorched my brain.    Now I saw, at the window, the good man who occupied the fatal Green  Chamber; he was a brave peasant of Nassau, with a large three-cornered  hat, a scarlet vest, and a laughing face; he smoked his pipe of Ulm  tranquillity, and seemed to fear no evil.    I felt a strong desire to cry out to him: \"Good man, be on your guard!  Do not allow yourself to be entrapped by the old wretch; distrust  yourself!\" but he would not have comprehended me. Toward two o'clock  Fledermausse returned. The noise of her door resounded through the  vestibule. Then alone, all alone, she entered the yard, and seated  herself on the interior step of the stairway; she put down her basket  before her, and drew out first some packets of herbs, then vegetables,  then a red vest, then a three-cornered hat, a coat of brown velvet,  pants of plush, and coarse woolen hose--the complete costume of the  peasant from Nassau.    For a moment I felt stunned; then flames passed before my eyes.    I recollected those precipices which entice with an irresistible power;  those wells or pits, which the police have been compelled to close,  because men threw themselves into them; those trees which had been cut  down because they inspired men with the idea of hanging themselves;  that contagion of suicides, of robberies, of murders, at certain  epochs, by desperate means; that strange and subtile enticement of  example, which makes you yawn because another yawns, suffer because you  see another suffer, kill yourself because you see others kill  themselves--and my hair stood up with horror.    How could this Fledermausse, this base, sordid creature, have derived  so profound a law of human nature? how had she found the means to use  this law to the profit or indulgence of her sanguinary instincts? This  I could not comprehend; it surpassed my wildest imaginations.    But reflecting longer upon this inexplicable mystery, I resolved to  turn the fatal law against her, and to draw the old murderess into her  own net.    So many innocent victims called out for vengeance!    I felt myself to be on the right path.    I went to all the old-clothes sellers in Nuremberg, and returned in the  afternoon to the Inn Boeuf-Gras, with an enormous packet under my arm.    Nichel Schmidt had known me for a long time; his wife was fat and  good-looking; I had painted her portrait.    \"Ah, Master Christian,\" said he, squeezing my hand, \"what happy  circumstance brings you here? What procures me the pleasure of seeing  you?\"    \"My dear Monsieur Schmidt, I feel a vehement, insatiable desire to  sleep in the Green Room.\"    We were standing on the threshold of the inn, and I pointed to the  room. The good man looked at me distrustfully.    \"Fear nothing,\" I said; \"I have no desire to hang myself.\".    \"_A la bonne heure! a la bonne heure!_ For frankly that would give me  pain; an artist of such merit! When do you wish the room, Master  Christian?\"    \"This evening.\"    \"Impossible! it is occupied!\"    \"Monsieur can enter immediately,\" said a voice just behind me, \"I will  not be in the way.\"    We turned around in great surprise; the peasant of Nassau stood before  us, with his three-cornered hat, and his packet at the end of his  walking stick. He had just learned the history of his three  predecessors in the Green Room, and was trembling with rage.    \"Rooms like yours!\" cried he, stuttering; \"but it is murderous to put  people there--it is assassination! You deserve to be sent to the  galleys immediately!\"    \"Go--go--calm yourself,\" said the innkeeper; \"that did not prevent you  from sleeping well.\"    \"Happily, I said my prayers at night,\" said the peasant; \"without that,  where would I be?\" and he withdrew, with his hands raised to heaven.    \"Well,\" said Nichel Schmidt, stupefied, \"the room is vacant, but I  entreat you, do not serve me a bad trick.\"    \"It would be a worse trick for myself than for you, monsieur.\"    I gave my packet to the servants, and installed myself for the time  with the drinkers. For a long time I had not felt so calm and happy.  After so many doubts and disquietudes, I touched the goal. The horizon  seemed to clear up, and it appeared that some invisible power gave me  the hand. I lighted my pipe, placed my elbow on the table, my wine  before me, and listened to the chorus in \"Freischuetz,\" played by a  troupe of gypsies from the Black Forest. The trumpets, the hue and cry  of the chase, the hautboys, plunged me into a vague reverie, and, at  times rousing up to look at the hour, I asked myself gravely, if all  which _had_ happened to me was not a dream. But the watchman came to  ask us to leave the _salle_, and soon other and more solemn thoughts  were surging in my soul, and in deep meditation I followed little  Charlotte, who preceded me with a candle to my room.    We mounted the stairs to the third story. Charlotte gave me the candle  and pointed to the door.    \"There,\" said she, and descended rapidly.    I opened the door."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#20)"],[1," were eager to come out as well as possible in  the dreaded semi-ans.    Dave and Dan both had secured permission to go into Annapolis.    \"We'll want to clear out the cobwebs by a brisk walk, anyway,\"  declared Darrin.    They did not intend to go townward, however, until rather late  in the afternoon.    Dan, when he could stand the grind no longer picked up his cap.  Dave wanted to put in least fifteen minutes more over his book.    \"I've got to get out in the air,\" Dalzell muttered.    \"Going to town?\" Dave asked.    \"Yes.  Coming along?\"    \"I've got a little more in logarithms to clean up,\" murmured Darrin,  looking wistfully at two pages in one of his text-books on mathematics.  \"Will it do as well, Danny boy, if I follow in fifteen or twenty  minutes?\"    \"Yes; you'll probably find me on Main Street, though you can look  in at Wiegard's on the way.\"    Wiegard's is the famous confectionery shop where cadets go for  candy, for ices or soda fountain drinks.  If upper class men and  young ladies are plentiful in Wiegard's, however, prudent fourth  class men keep right on without stopping.    Dan left Bancroft Hall quite certain that his chum would not be  along for at least an hour.    At the gate Dan made his report of liberty, then kept on up Maryland  Avenue.    As he turned into State Circle he slowed up a trifle, glancing  in through the door at Wiegard's.    \"Too many upper class men in there for me,\" decided Dan, so turning  he made his was way through the State Capitol grounds, and on into  Main Street.    Here he strolled more slowly, passing, here and there, a member  of his class, though none with whom he was particularly intimate.    \"I'm thirsty,\" decided Dalzell.  \"I don't believe I want any of  the hot drinks.  There's Tony's.  I'll drop in and get a bottle  of soda lemonade.\"    Tony saw the fourth classman coming, and a peculiar smile crossed  his lips.  On the occasion on which Brimmer had pointed out the  chums to the Greek the latter had understood that it was Dan who  was to be the principal victim.    \"Good afternoon, Tony!\" was Dan's greeting, as he stepped into  the shop.  \"Merry Christmas.\"    \"Thank you, sare, good frien',\" was Tony's reply.  Then the Greek  turned briefly, to hide a grin.    \"Crowd seems to have left you, Tony,\" said Dan sympathetically.    \"Save their money to buy present for girls,\" guessed the Greek.    \"Tony, have you a small bottle of lemon soda that's good and cold?\"    \"Oh, yes, sare.\"    \"Then I want it.\"    Tony fumbled among bottles clinking in ice under the counter.  At last he found what he wanted and held the bottle up to the  capping machine.  Then the Greek did something unusual.  Instead  of emptying the bottle into a glass on the counter he performed  that service underneath the counter.  Next he held the glass up  full of bright, cold liquid filled with bubble and sparkle.    \"It makes me thirstier to look at this,\" muttered Dan, picking  up the glass.  \"I'll get it down as soon as I can.\"    He sipped the last out of the glass, put do a coin to pay for  it, and stood, for a moment, chatting with Tony.    \"Excuse me, sare,\" broke in the Greek, suddenly.  \"I hear ma wife  call me.\"    Opening a door behind him Tony stepped into a hallway.    The short December afternoon was drawing to a close.  Standing  in the shop Dan saw that the light in the street was growing less.    \"I'll walk a little further down the street,\" thought Dan.  \"Then  I'll turn back, and keep on toward State Circle, and look for Dave.\"    As he took the first step away from the store Dalzell noticed  a slight feeling of dizziness.    After a moment this passed off, but soon it came on again, heavier  than before.    \"What ails me?\" wondered the astonished midshipman.  \"It can't  be that I'm turning sick, for I've been feeling fine all along.\"    He tried the effect of will power, holding himself as erect as  he could and trying to walk slowly in a straight line.    Then, though he did not realize it, three or four passers-by turned  to look at the unsteady young man in a midshipman's uniform.    Two men passing in an auto runabout glanced quickly at Dan.    \"Look at that fool midshipman, throwing away a great future for  a few glasses of strong drink,\" he remarked to his companion.  Then the auto sped on.    As for Dan Dalzell, he no longer understood clearly what was happening.    At this lower end of Main Street, on which he was now moving,  there were not many people astir.  One there was behind him,  however--Tony, the Greek, following stealthily on his trail.    At last, as Dalzell reached the head of a short, narrow alleyway  Tony caught up with him in the darkness that had now fallen.    A quick shove Tony gave the midshipman, and Dan, helpless, staggered  into the alleyway, tripped and fell.    Tony passed on as though he had merely accidentally jostled another.    Then, in an instant he wheeled, went back the head of the alley  and glanced in.    Dan Dalzell was lying still, in a complete stupor.    With a chuckle the Greek drew a small bottle from one of his pockets,  taking out the stopper and throwing it away.  Then he began sprinkling  the contents on Dan's uniform coat with energy.    At that instant there was a quick step outside.  Then Dave Darrin,  tall, handsome, and even distinguished-looking in the uniform  that he wore so well, bounded in, gripping the Greek's right arm  in a tight grasp.    \"You rascal!\" vibrated Dave's angry voice.  \"What are you doing  here?\"    It being darker in the alleyway than it was outside, Tony did  not recognize his captor.  Dave towered so in his wrath that the  Greek took him to be an officer of the Navy.    \"Speak up, before I shake the truth out of you!\" warned Darrin.  \"Do you understand that this is a crime, you knave, and that  I can place you under arrest and have you sent to the penitentiary  for years?\"    Tony was now sure that he was in the clutch of a Naval officer.  Moreover, Darrin's grip was one that spoke of more muscular strength  held in reserve.    \"Let me go, sare!\" begged the Greek, squirming.  \"This ees all  one joke.  I do ze man no harm.\"    For answer, Dave used his left hand to snatch away the bottle  that Tony still held.    \"Alcohol!\" detected Dave, and hurled the bottle to the other end  of the alleyway.  \"And you have been sprinkling it on this midshipman's  uniform?  You are the fellow who runs the temperance drinks place?  A nice business for you to be in--drugging midshipmen and trying  to ruin them!  To prison you go, unless you limber up your tongue.  Who put you up to this miserable business?  Talk quickly--or  off to a cell you go!\"    This was pure bluff, as Dave, being under twenty-one, had no right  to make an arrest, even as a citizen.  But he saw that he had  the Greek scared, and he resolved to push his advantage to the limit.    \"Talk this instant, or to the police station you go!\" warned Dave.  \"Then it will be years before you are a free man again.\"    \"Mercy, Captain!\" howled the frightened Greek.    \"Then out with the whole truth like lightning!\" ordered Dave Darrin.    He accompanied his order with a shaking that made the Greek's  teeth rattle.    \"Stop, sare, stop!  I tell you!\" whined Tony.    \"Go ahead, then, you brute.\"    \"You know Midsheepman Brimmer?\"    \"I know him,\" repeated Dave.    \"He tell me, sare, about one joke.  He geev me bottle of stuff,  and he tell me when this midsheepman, or his friend, come in my  place I am to put half of stuff in the bottle in one glass of  what the midsheepman order.  Then I am to follow the midsheepman  out, and watch him until he fall.  I am also to have bottle of  alcohol with me and sprinkle some on the midsheepman when he fall  and lie still.  Then I am to go away and let the midsheepman be  found.  It is to be one grand joke on the midsheepman.\"    \"Give me what is left of the bottle of stuff that Midshipman Brimmer  gave you to put in the drink,\" commanded Dave sternly.    Tony's first impulse was to deny that he had the vial with him.  But Darrin's grip on the fellow's arm tightened so alarmingly  that the Greek thrust his left hand down into a trousers pocket,  then produced the vial, which Darrin pocketed.    \"So this is Brimmer's work--and Brimmer was at one time Henkel's  roommate and crony!\" flashed swiftly through Darrin's mind.  \"Oh,  the scoundrel!\"    \"Some one ees coming, sare,\" warned Tony.  \"Let me go, sare.\"    \"Stay where you are, and don't dare make a move to get away,\"  warned Darrin.  \"It would do you no good, anyway.  I know where  to find you.\"    Then Darrin peeped cautiously out at the head of the alley.  Some  one was coming, and that some one wore the Naval uniform.  Dave's  heart began to beat faster.  Then the wearer the uniform passed  the light from a store window, and his face was briefly revealed.  Darrin's heart, for a few seconds, seemed almost to stop beating.  For it was Brimmer himself!    Further up in the town that midshipman had heard a fleeting word,  uttered by some one, about a staggering midshipman having been  seen going down Main Street.    \"A dollar to a doughnut it's Darrin himself!  flashed exultantly  through Brimmer's mind.  He hurried on, though careful to avoid  the appearance of haste.    \"I wish Henkel were here at this moment!\" thought Brimmer.  \"Oh,  it will be great to see that sneak, Darrin--\"    Just at that moment Brimmer stopped short, with something like  a gasp.    For he did see Darrin, standing before him, towering in his wrath.          CHAPTER XVIII    IN THE DAYS OF \"OLD TWO-FIVE\"      Before Brimmer could utter a word Darrin pounced upon him, seizing  him by the collar and fairly dragging him into the alleyway.    Then, still gripping his astounded, dismayed foe, Darrin demanded:    \"Tony, is this the fellow who paid you to drug my friend?    \"The treacherous Greek has betrayed me!\" was the thought that  flashed instantly through Brimmer's startled mind.    \"L"]]]
