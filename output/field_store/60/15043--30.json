In effect, they forbid the things that the  strongest forces of the community wish forbidden, things which may or  may not be the gravest and most anti-social acts, but which at least  seem to the strong to be most hostile to their interests and ruling  emotions.          XIX    MEDICAL EXPERTS      So long as the ordinary ideal of punishment prevails, a crime must  consist of an act coupled with an intent to do the thing, which probably  means an intent to do evil. This is no doubt the right interpretation of  intent, although cases can be found, generally of a minor grade, which  hold that evil intent is not necessary to the crime. Under the law as  generally laid down, insanity is a defense to crime when the insanity is  so far advanced as to blot out and obliterate the sense of right and  wrong or render the accused unable to choose the right and avoid the  wrong. Of course, legal definitions of scientific terms, processes, or  things, do not ordinarily show the highest wisdom. It is safe to say  that few judges or lawyers have ever been students of insanity, of the  relation of \"will\" to \"conduct,\" or of other questions of science or  philosophy. Each man confines himself to his field of operation, and the  love of living does not induce him to go far from the matter in hand,  which to him means the base of supplies.    The insane are exempted from punishment for crime on the ground that  they are not able to prepare and attend to their cases when placed on  trial and on the further ground that their \"free will\" is destroyed by  disease or \"something else,\" and therefore they could form no intent. In  another place I have tried to point out the fact that the acts of the  sane and the insane are moved by like causes, but this is not the theory  of the law.    Insanity is often very insidious. Many cases are easily classified, but  there is always the border line, the twilight zone, which is sure to  exist in moral questions and in all questions of human conduct, and this  is hard to settle. It is generally determined by the feelings of a jury,  moved or not by the prejudice of the public, depending on whether the  community has been lashed or persuaded to take a hand in the conduct of  the case.    Lawyers and judges are not psychologists or psychiatrists, neither are  juries. Therefore the doctor must be called in. As a rule, the lawyer  has little respect for expert opinion. He has so often seen and heard  all sorts of experts testify for the side that employs them and give  very excellent reasons for their positive and contradictory opinions,  that he is bound to regard them with doubt. In fact, while lawyers  respect and admire many men who are expert witnesses, and while many  such men are men of worth, still they know that the expert is like the  lawyer: he takes the case of the side that employs him, and does the  best he can. The expert is an every-day frequenter of the courts; he  makes his living by testifying for contesting litigants. Of course  scientific men do not need to be told that the receipt of or expectation  of a fee is not conducive to arriving at scientific results. Every  psychologist knows that, as a rule, men believe what they wish to  believe and that the hope of reward is an excellent reason for wanting  to believe. It is not my intention to belittle scientific knowledge or  to criticise experts beyond such general statements as will apply to all  men. I have often received the services of medical experts when valuable  time was given without any financial reward, purely from a sense of  justice. But all men are bound to be interested in arriving at the  conclusion they wish to reach. Furthermore, the contending lawyers are  willing to assist them in arriving at the conclusions that the lawyer  wants.    It is almost inevitable that both sides will employ experts when they  have the means. The poor defendant is hopelessly handicapped. He is, as  a rule, unable to get a skillful lawyer or skillful experts. A doctor's  opinion on insanity is none too good, especially in a case where he is  called only for a casual examination and has not had the chance for long  study. The doctor for the prosecution may find that the subject can play  cards and talk connectedly on most things, and as he is casually  visiting him for a purpose, he can see no difference between him and  other men. This may well be the case and still have little to do with  insanity. Experts called for the defense cannot always be sure that the  patient truthfully answers the questions. A doctor must make up his mind  from examining the patient, except so far as hypothetical questions may  be used. In all larger cities, certain doctors are regularly employed by  the prosecution. While it would be too much to say that they always find  the patient sane, it is safe to say that they nearly always do.  Especially is this true in times of public clamor, which affects all  human conduct. A court trial with an insanity defense often comes down  largely to the relative impression of the testimony of the experts who  flatly contradict each other, leaving with intelligent men a doubt as to  whether either one really meant to tell the truth. The jury knows that  they are paid for their opinions and regards them more or less as it  regards the lawyers in the case. It listens to them but does not rely  upon their opinions. Expert testimony is always unsatisfactory in a  contested case. Under present methods, it can never be any different.    There is another danger: juries do not know the difference in the  standing, character and attainments of doctors, so the tendency is  always to find the man who will make the best appearance and testify  the most positively for his side. This is unfair to the expert, unfair  to science, and unfair to the case.    The method for overcoming this difficulty that has received most  sanction from students is that experts shall be chosen by the state and  appear for neither side. This, like most other things, has advantages  and disadvantages. State officials, or those chosen by the state,  usually come to regard themselves as a part of the machinery of justice  and to stand with the prosecuting attorney for conviction. It will most  likely be the same with state defenders. No one who really would defend  could be elected or could be appointed, and it would work out in really  having two prosecutors, one nominally representing the defense. A  defendant should be left to get any lawyer or any expert he wishes. No  one can be sure that the state expert will be better than the others.  All one can say is that state experts may not be partisans, but, in  effect, this would mean that they would not be partisans for the  defendant. The constant association with the prosecutor, the officers of  the jail, the public officials, and those charged with enforcing the  law, would almost surely place them on the side of the state. Such men  must be elected or appointed by some tribunal. This brings them to the  attention of the public and makes them dependent on the public. The  expert's interest will then be the same as the interest of the  prosecutor and the judge.    The prosecuting attorney is not a partisan. His office is judicial. He  is not interested in convicting or paid for convicting, and yet, no sane  person familiar with courts would think that the defendant could be  safely left in his hands. Assuming he is honest, it makes little  difference. Almost no prosecutor dares do anything the public does not  demand. Neither, as a rule, has he training nor interest to study any  subject but the law. The profounder and more important matters affecting  life and conduct are a sealed book which he could not open if he would.  Very soon under our political system the expert business would gravitate  into the hands of politicians, the last group that should handle any  scientific problem. I am free to confess the difficulties of the present  system, but some other way may be even worse. It must always be  remembered that this country is governed by public opinion, that public  opinion is always crude, uninformed and heartless. In criminal cases  there is no time to set it right. The position of the accused is hard  enough at best. He is really presumed guilty before he starts. Every  lawyer employed to any extent in criminal practice knows that in an  important case his greatest danger is public opinion. He would not take  the officers and attaches of the court as jurors, although they might  be good men, for their interest and psychology would be always for  conviction.    If defendants were not regarded as moral delinquents, if the examination  implied no moral condemnation, if it was only a scientific investigation  as to where to place him if he is anti-social, if public opinion  supported this view, then experts should be appointed by the court. On  this phase of the case there would be little need of experts. I would be  willing to go further and say that then, too, the partisan lawyer, the  hired advocate, should disappear. The machinery of justice would be  all-sufficient to take care of the liberties of every man, to give him  proper treatment in disease, to restore him to freedom when safe, and,  when that time does come, the unseemly contest in courts will disappear,  and justice, tempered with mercy, will have a chance.          XX    PUNISHMENT      Assuming that man is justified in fixing the moral worth of his fellow;  that he is justified in punishment for the purpose of making the  offender suffer; and that these punishments according to the degree of  severity will in some way pay for or make good the criminal act or  protect or help society or prevent crime or even help the offender or  someone else, what finally is the correct basis of fixing penalties?    No science, experience,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#20)"],[1,"   Vaisampayana said, \"Thus despatched by her elder brother, the far-famed  daughter of king Matsya, adorned with a golden necklace, ever obedient  to her brother and possessed of a waist slender as that of the wasp,[36]  endued with the splendour of Lakshmi herself,[37] decked with the plumes  of the peacock of slender make and graceful limbs, her hips encircled by  a zone of pearls, her eye-lashes slightly curved, and her form endued  with every grace, hastily repaired to the dancing-hall like a flash of  lightning rushing towards a mass of dark clouds.[38] And the faultless  and auspicious daughter of Virata, of fine teeth and slender-waist, of  thighs close unto each other and each like the trunk of an elephant, her  person embellished with an excellent garland, sought the son of Pritha  like a she-elephant seeking her mate. And like unto a precious gem or  the very embodiment of prosperity of Indra, of exceeding beauty and  large eyes, that charming and adored and celebrated damsel saluted  Arjuna. And saluted by her, Partha asked that maiden of close thighs and  golden complexion, saying 'What brings thee hither, a damsel decked in a  necklace of gold? Why art thou in such a hurry, O gazelle-eyed maiden?  Why is thy face, O beauteous lady, so cheerless? Tell me all this  without delay!'\"        [36] _Vedi-Vilagnamadhya_--Vedi in this connection means a wasp      and not, as explained by Mallinatha in his commentary of the      _Kumarasambhava_, a sacrificial platform. I would remark in      passing that many of the most poetic and striking adjectives in      both the Raghu and the _Kumarasambhava_ of Kalidasa are borrowed      unblushingly from the _Ramayana_ and the _Mahabharata_.        [37] _Padma patrabha-nibha_ may also mean 'of the splendour of      the gem called Marakata.' Nilakantha, however, shows that this      would militate against the adjective _Kankojwalatwacham_ below.        [38] The princess being of the complexion of burnished gold and      Arjuna dark as a mass of clouds, the comparison is exceedingly      appropriate. The Vaishnava poets of Bengal never tire of this      simile in speaking of Radha and Krishna in the groves of      Vrindavana.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Beholding, O king, his friend, the princess of  large-eyes (in that plight), her friend (Arjuna) cheerfully enquired of  her (in these words) the cause of her arrival there and then. And having  approached that bull among men, the princess, standing in the midst of  her female attendants, the displaying proper modesty[39], addressed him,  saying, 'The kine of this realm, O Vrihannala, are being driven away by  the Kurus, and it is to conquer them that my brother will set out bow in  hand. Not long ago his own charioteer was slain in battle, and there is  none equal unto the one slain that can act as my brother's charioteer.  And unto him striving to obtain a charioteer, _Sairindhri_, O  Vrihannala, hath spoken about thy skill in the management of steeds.  Thou wert formerly the favourite charioteer of Arjuna, and it was with  thee that that bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the  whole earth. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, act as the charioteer of  my brother. (By this time) our kine have surely been driven away by the  Kurus to a great distance. Requested by me if thou dost not act up to my  words, I who am asking this service of thee out of affection, will give  up my life!' Thus addressed by this friend of graceful hips, that  oppressor of foes, endued with immeasurable prowess, went into the  prince's presence. And like unto a she-elephant running after her young  one, the princess possessed of large eyes followed that hero advancing  with hasty steps like unto an elephant with rent temples. And beholding  him from a distance, the prince himself said, 'With thee as his  charioteer, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti had gratified _Agni_ at the  Khandava forest and subjugated the whole world! The _Sairindhri_ hath  spoken of thee to me. She knoweth the Pandavas. Do thou, therefore, O  Vrihannala, hold, as thou didst, the reins of my steeds, desirous as I  am of righting with the Kurus and rescuing my bovine wealth. Thou wert  formerly the beloved charioteer of Arjuna and it was with thee that that  bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the whole earth!' Thus  addressed, Vrihannala replied unto the prince, saying, 'What ability  have I to act as a charioteer in the field of battle? If it is song or  dance or musical instruments or such other things, I can entertain thee  therewith, but where is my skill for becoming a charioteer?'        [39] The words in the original is _pranayam_, lit., love.      Nilakantha, however, explains it as meaning modesty, humility. I      think, Nilakantha is right. The relations between Arjuna and the      princess were like those between father and daughter.    \"Uttara said, 'O Vrihannala, be thou a singer or a dancer, hold thou  (for the present), without loss of time, the reins of my excellent  steeds, mounting upon my car!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Although that oppressor of foes, the son of  Pandu, was acquainted with everything, yet in the presence of Uttara, he  began to make many mistakes for the sake of fun. And when he sought to  put the coat of mail on his body by raising it upwards, the large-eyed  maidens, beholding it, burst out into a loud laughter. And seeing him  quite ignorant of putting on armour, Uttara himself equipped Vrihannala  with a costly coat of mail. And casing his own person in an excellent  armour of solar effulgence, and hoisting his standard bearing the figure  of a lion, the prince caused Vrihannala to become his charioteer. And  with Vrihannala to hold his reins, the hero set out, taking with him  many costly bows and a large number of beautiful arrows. And his friend,  Uttara and her maidens then said unto Vrihannala, 'Do thou, O  Vrihannala, bring for our dolls (when thou comest back) various kinds of  good and fine cloths after vanquishing the Kurus assembled for battle of  whom Bhishma and Drona are foremost!' Thus addressed, Partha the son of  Pandu, in a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, smilingly said unto  that bevy of fair maidens. 'If thus Uttara can vanquish those mighty  warriors in battle, I will certainly bring excellent and beautiful  cloths.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having said these words, the heroic Arjuna  urged the steeds towards the Kuru army over which floated innumerable  flags. Just, however, as they were starting, elderly dames and maidens,  and Brahmanas of rigid vows, beholding Uttara seated on his excellent  car with Vrihannala as charioteer and under that great banner hoisted on  high, walked round the car to bless the hero. And the women said, 'Let  the victory that Arjuna treading like a bull had achieved of old on the  occasion of burning the forest of Khandava, be thine, O Vrihannala, when  thou encounterest the Kurus today with prince Uttara.'\"      SECTION XXXVIII    Vaisampayana said, \"Having issued forth from the city, the dauntless son  of Virata addressed his charioteer, saying, 'Proceed whither the Kurus  are. Defeating the assembled Kurus who have come hither from desire of  victory, and quickly rescuing my kine from them, I will return to the  capital.' At these words of the prince, the son of Pandu urged those  excellent steeds. And endued with the speed of the wind and decked with  necklaces of gold, those steeds, urged by that lion among men, seemed to  fly through the air. And they had not proceeded far when those smiters  of foes, Dhananjaya and the son of Matsya, sighted the army of the  powerful Kurus. And proceeding towards the cemetery, they came upon the  Kurus and beheld their army arrayed in order of battle.[40] And that  large army of theirs looked like the vast sea or a forest of innumerable  trees moving through the sky. And then was seen, O best among the Kurus,  the dust raised by that moving army which reached the sky and obstructed  the sight of all creatures. And beholding that mighty host abounding in  elephants, horses and chariots, and protected by Karna and Duryodhana  and Kripa and Santanu's son, and that intelligent and great bowman  Drona, with his son (Aswatthaman), the son of Virata, agitated with fear  and the bristles on his body standing on their ends, thus spake unto  Partha, 'I dare not fight with the Kurus. See, the bristles on my body  have stood on their ends. I am incapable of battling with this countless  host of the Kurus, abounding in the heroic warriors, that are extremely  fierce and difficult of being vanquished even by the celestials. I do  not venture to penetrate into the army of the Bharatas consisting of  terrible bowmen and abounding in horses and elephants and cars and  footsoldiers and banners. My mind is too much perturbed by the very  sight of the foe on the field of battle on which stand Drona and  Bhishma, and Kripa, and Karna, and Vivingsati, and Aswatthaman and  Vikarna, and Saumadatti, and Vahlika, and the heroic king Duryodhana  also--that foremost of car-warriors, and many other splendid bowmen, all  skilled in battle. My hairs have stood on their ends, and I am fainting  with fear at the very sight of these smiters, the Kurus arrayed in order  of battle.'\"        [40] This sloka is not correctly printed in any of the texts      that I have seen. The Burdwan Pandits read _tat-samim_. This I      think, is correct, but then _asasada_ in the singular when the      other verbs are all dual seems to be correct. The poet must have      used some other verb in the dual for _asasada_.    Vaisampayana continued, \"And the low-minded and foolish Uttara out of  folly alone, began to bewail (his fate) in the presence of the  high-spirited (Arjuna) disguised (as his charioteer) in these words, 'My  father hath gone out to meet the Trigartas taking with him his whole  army, leaving me in the empty city. There are no troops to "]]]
