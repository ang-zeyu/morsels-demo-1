The highest satisfaction and expression of the  individual is only to be found in his complete absorption, and that is  only possible through love. Now a human being is both MAN and WOMAN: it  is only when these two are united that the real human being exists; and  thus it is only by love that man and woman attain to the full measure  of humanity. But when nowadays we talk of a human being, such heartless  blockheads are we that quite involuntarily we only think of man. It is  only in the union of man and woman by love (sensuous and supersensuous)  that the human being exists; and as the human being cannot rise to the  conception of anything higher than his own existence--his own being--so  the transcendent act of his life is this consummation of his humanity  through love.\"    It is clear after this utterance from the would-be Schopenhaurian, that  Wagner's explanations of his works for the most part explain nothing but  the mood in which he happened to be on the day he advanced them, or  the train of thought suggested to his very susceptible imagination and  active mind by the points raised by his questioner. Especially in his  private letters, where his outpourings are modified by his dramatic  consciousness of the personality of his correspondent, do we find him  taking all manner of positions, and putting forward all sorts of cases  which must be taken as clever and suggestive special pleadings, and  not as serious and permanent expositions of his works. These works must  speak for themselves: if The Ring says one thing, and a letter written  afterwards says that it said something else, The Ring must be taken to  confute the letter just as conclusively as if the two had been written  by different hands. However, nobody fairly well acquainted with Wagner's  utterances as a whole will find any unaccountable contradictions in  them. As in all men of his type, our manifold nature was so marked in  him that he was like several different men rolled into one. When he had  exhausted himself in the character of the most pugnacious, aggressive,  and sanguine of reformers, he rested himself as a Pessimist and  Nirvanist. In The Ring the quietism of Brynhild's \"Rest, rest, thou God\"  is sublime in its deep conviction; but you have only to turn back the  pages to find the irrepressible bustle of Siegfried and the revelry of  the clansmen expressed with equal zest. Wagner was not a Schopenhaurite  every day in the week, nor even a Wagnerite. His mind changes as  often as his mood. On Monday nothing will ever induce him to return to  quilldriving: on Tuesday he begins a new pamphlet. On Wednesday he  is impatient of the misapprehensions of people who cannot see how  impossible it is for him to preside as a conductor over platform  performances of fragments of his works, which can only be understood  when presented strictly according to his intention on the stage: on  Thursday he gets up a concert of Wagnerian selections, and when it is  over writes to his friends describing how profoundly both bandsmen and  audience were impressed. On Friday he exults in the self-assertion  of Siegfried's will against all moral ordinances, and is full of a  revolutionary sense of \"the universal law of change and renewal\": on  Saturday he has an attack of holiness, and asks, \"Can you conceive a  moral action of which the root idea is not renunciation?\" In short,  Wagner can be quoted against himself almost without limit, much as  Beethoven's adagios could be quoted against his scherzos if a dispute  arose between two fools as to whether he was a melancholy man or a merry  one.          THE MUSIC OF THE RING    THE REPRESENTATIVE THEMES    To be able to follow the music of The Ring, all that is necessary is to  become familiar enough with the brief musical phrases out of which it  is built to recognize them and attach a certain definite significance  to them, exactly as any ordinary Englishman recognizes and attaches a  definite significance to the opening bars of God Save the King. There is  no difficulty here: every soldier is expected to learn and distinguish  between different bugle calls and trumpet calls; and anyone who can  do this can learn and distinguish between the representative themes or  \"leading motives\" (Leitmotifs) of The Ring. They are the easier to learn  because they are repeated again and again; and the main ones are so  emphatically impressed on the ear whilst the spectator is looking for  the first time at the objects, or witnessing the first strong dramatic  expression of the ideas they denote, that the requisite association is  formed unconsciously. The themes are neither long, nor complicated, nor  difficult. Whoever can pick up the flourish of a coach-horn, the note of  a bird, the rhythm of the postman's knock or of a horse's gallop, will  be at no loss in picking up the themes of The Ring. No doubt, when it  comes to forming the necessary mental association with the theme, it  may happen that the spectator may find his ear conquering the tune more  easily than his mind conquers the thought. But for the most part the  themes do not denote thoughts at all, but either emotions of a quite  simple universal kind, or the sights, sounds and fancies common enough  to be familiar to children. Indeed some of them are as frankly childish  as any of the funny little orchestral interludes which, in Haydn's  Creation, introduce the horse, the deer, or the worm. We have both the  horse and the worm in The Ring, treated exactly in Haydn's manner, and  with an effect not a whit less ridiculous to superior people who decline  to take it good-humoredly. Even the complaisance of good Wagnerites  is occasionally rather overstrained by the way in which Brynhild's  allusions to her charger Grani elicit from the band a little rum-ti-tum  triplet which by itself is in no way suggestive of a horse, although a  continuous rush of such triplets makes a very exciting musical gallop.    Other themes denote objects which cannot be imitatively suggested by  music: for instance, music cannot suggest a ring, and cannot suggest  gold; yet each of these has a representative theme which pervades the  score in all directions. In the case of the gold the association is  established by the very salient way in which the orchestra breaks into  the pretty theme in the first act of The Rhine Gold at the moment when  the sunrays strike down through the water and light up the glittering  treasure, hitherto invisible. The reference of the strange little  theme of the wishing cap is equally manifest from the first, since the  spectator's attention is wholly taken up with the Tarnhelm and its magic  when the theme is first pointedly uttered by the orchestra. The sword  theme is introduced at the end of The Rhine Gold to express Wotan's hero  inspiration; and I have already mentioned that Wagner, unable, when it  came to practical stage management, to forego the appeal to the eye as  well as to the thought, here made Wotan pick up a sword and brandish  it, though no such instruction appears in the printed score. When this  sacrifice to Wagner's scepticism as to the reality of any appeal to an  audience that is not made through their bodily sense is omitted, the  association of the theme with the sword is not formed until that point  in the first act of The Valkyries at which Siegmund is left alone by  Hunding's hearth, weaponless, with the assurance that he will have to  fight for his life at dawn with his host. He recalls then how his father  promised him a sword for his hour of need; and as he does so, a flicker  from the dying fire is caught by the golden hilt of the sword in the  tree, when the theme immediately begins to gleam through the quiver of  sound from the orchestra, and only dies out as the fire sinks and the  sword is once more hidden by the darkness. Later on, this theme, which  is never silent whilst Sieglinda is dwelling on the story of the sword,  leaps out into the most dazzling splendor the band can give it when  Siegmund triumphantly draws the weapon from the tree. As it consists of  seven notes only, with a very marked measure, and a melody like a simple  flourish on a trumpet or post horn, nobody capable of catching a tune  can easily miss it.    The Valhalla theme, sounded with solemn grandeur as the home of the gods  first appears to us and to Wotan at the beginning of the second scene  of The Rhine Gold, also cannot be mistaken. It, too, has a memorable  rhythm; and its majestic harmonies, far from presenting those novel or  curious problems in polyphony of which Wagner still stands suspected by  superstitious people, are just those three simple chords which festive  students who vamp accompaniments to comic songs \"by ear\" soon find  sufficient for nearly all the popular tunes in the world.    On the other hand, the ring theme, when it begins to hurtle through  the third scene of The Rhine Gold, cannot possibly be referred to any  special feature in the general gloom and turmoil of the den of the  dwarfs. It is not a melody, but merely the displaced metric accent which  musicians call syncopation, rung on the notes of the familiar chord  formed by piling three minor thirds on top of one another (technically,  the chord of the minor ninth, ci-devant diminished seventh). One soon  picks it up and identifies it; but it does not get introduced in the  unequivocally clear fashion of the themes described above, or of that  malignant monstrosity, the theme which denotes the curse on the gold.  Consequently it cannot be said that the musical design of the work is  perfectly clear at the first hearing as regards all the themes; but  it is so as regards most of them, the main lines being laid down as  emphatically and intelligibly as the dramatic motives"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#20)"],[1,"bs.        \"Holy and pure are the drops that fall,       When the young bride goes from her father's hall;       She goes unto love yet untried and new--       She parts from love which hath still been true.\"    It was his turn now to comfort her. \"Darling daughter,\" he said, caressing  her with exceeding tenderness, \"we do not part for long. Should it please  God to spare our lives, I shall have my precious one in my arms in a few  short weeks. Meantime we can have a little talk on paper every day. Shall  we not?\"    \"Yes, yes, dear, dear, precious father.\"    Mr. Travilla stood by with a face full of compassionate tenderness.  Putting one hand into her father's, Elsie turned, gave him the other, and  together they led her to the carriage and placed her in it. There was a  hearty, lingering hand-shaking between the two gentlemen. Mr. Travilla  took his seat by Elsie's side, and amid a chorus of good-byes they were  whirled rapidly away.    \"Cheer up, my dear,\" said Rose, leaning affectionately on her husband's  arm; \"it is altogether addition and not subtraction; you have not lost a  daughter but gained a son.\"    \"These rooms tell a different tale,\" he answered with a sigh. \"How  desolate they seem. But this is no time for the indulgence of sadness. We  must return to our guests, and see that all goes merry as a marriage bell  with them till the last has taken his departure.\"          CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.                                      \"My bride,      My wife, my life. O we will walk this world      Yok'd in all exercise of noble aim      And so through those dark gates across the wild      That no man knows.\"                                --TENNYSON'S PRINCESS.      Elsie's tears were falling fast, but an arm as strong and kind as her  father's stole quietly about her, a hand as gentle and tender as a woman's  drew the weary head to a resting-place on her husband's shoulder, smoothed  back the hair from the heated brow, and wiped away the falling drops.    \"My wife! my own precious little wife!\"    How the word, the tone, thrilled her! her very heart leaped for joy  through all the pain of parting from one scarcely less dear. \"My husband,\"  she murmured, low and shyly--it seemed so strange to call him that, so  almost bold and forward--\"my dear, kind friend, to be neither hurt nor  angry at my foolish weeping.\"    \"Not foolish, dear one, but perfectly natural and right. I understand it;  I who know so well what your father has been to you these many years.\"    \"Father and mother both.\"    \"Yes; tutor, friend, companion, confidant, everything. I know, dear little  wife, that you are sacrificing much for me, even though the separation  will be but partial. And how I love you for it, and for all you are to  me, God only knows.\"    The tears had ceased to flow; love, joy, and thankfulness were regaining  their ascendancy in the heart of the youthful bride; she became again  calmly, serenely happy.    The journey was accomplished without accident. They were favored with  warm, bright days, clear, starlit nights; and on as lovely an afternoon as  was ever known in that delicious clime, reached Viamede.    Great preparations had been made for their reception; banners were  streaming, and flags flying from balconies and tree-tops. Mr. Mason met  them at the pier with a face beaming with delight; Spriggs with a stiff  bow. A gun was fired and a drum began to beat as they stepped ashore; two  pretty mulatto girls scattered flowers in their path, and passing under a  grand triumphal arch they presently found themselves between two long rows  of smiling, bowing negroes, whose fervent ejaculations: \"God bless our  dear young missus an' her husband!\" \"God bless you, massa an' missus!\"  \"Welcome home!\" \"Welcome to Viamede!\" \"We've not forgot you, Miss Elsie;  you's as welcome as de daylight!\" affected our tender-hearted heroine  almost to tears.    She had a kind word for each, remembering all their names, and inquiring  after their \"miseries\"; every one was permitted to take her small white  hand, many of them kissing it with fervent affection. They were introduced  to their \"new master,\" too (that was what she called him), and shaken  hands with by him in a cordial interested way that won their hearts at  once.    Aunt Phillis was in her glory, serving up a feast the preparation of which  had exhausted the united skill of both Aunt Sally and herself. Their  efforts were duly appreciated and praised, the viands evidently greatly  enjoyed, all to their intense delight.    Mr. Mason was invited to partake with the bride and groom, and assigned  the seat of honor at Mr. Travilla's right hand. Elsie presided over the  tea-urn with the same gentle dignity and grace as when her father occupied  the chair at the opposite end of the table, now filled by her husband. Her  traveling dress had been exchanged for one of simple white, and there were  white flowers in her hair and at her throat. Very sweet and charming she  looked, not only in the eyes of her husband, who seemed to find her fair  face a perpetual feast, but in those of all others who saw her.    On leaving the table they repaired to the library, where Mr. Mason gave a  report of the condition of the people and his work among them, also  assuring Mrs. Travilla that Spriggs had carefully carried out her wishes,  that the prospect for the crops was fine, and everything on the estate in  excellent order.    She expressed her gratification, appealing to Mr. Travilla for his  approval, which was cordially given; said she had brought a little gift  for each of the people, and desired they should be sent up to the house  about sunset the next evening to receive it.    The chaplain promised that her order should be attended to, then retired,  leaving husband and wife alone together.    \"All very satisfactory, my little friend, was it not?\" said Mr. Travilla.    \"Yes, sir, very. I'm so glad to have secured such a man as Mr. Mason to  look after the welfare of these poor helpless creatures. And you like the  house, Mr. Travilla, do you not?\"    \"Very much, so far as I have seen it. This is a beautiful room, and the  dining-room pleased me equally well.\"    \"Ah, I am eager to show you all!\" she cried, rising quickly and laying her  hand on the bell-rope.    \"Stay, little wife, not to-night,\" he said, \"you are too much fatigued.\"    She glided to the back of the easy chair in which he sat, and leaning over  him, said laughingly, \"I'm not conscious of being fatigued, but I have  promised to obey and----\"    \"Hush, hush!\" he said flushing, \"I meant to have that left out; and did I  not tell you you were to have your own way that night and ever after?  You've already done enough of obeying to last you a lifetime. But please  come round where I can see you better.\" Then, as she stepped to his side,  he threw an arm about her and drew her to his knee.    \"But it wasn't left out,\" she said, shyly returning his fond caress; \"I  promised and must keep my word.\"    \"Ah, but if you can't, you can't; how will you obey when you get no  orders?\"    \"So you don't mean to give me any?\"    \"No, indeed; I'm your husband, your friend, your protector, your lover,  but not your master.\"    \"Now, Mr. Travilla----\"    \"I asked you to call me Edward.\"    \"But it seems so disrespectful.\"    \"More so than to remind me of the disparity of our years? or than to  disregard my earnest wish? Then I think I'll have to require the keeping  of the promise in this one thing. Say Edward, little wife, and never again  call me Mr. Travilla when we are alone.\"    \"Well, Edward, I will try to obey; and if I use the wrong word through  forgetfulness you must please excuse it. But ah, I remember papa would say  that was no excuse.\"    \"But I shall not be so strict--unless you forget too often. I have  sometimes thought my friend too hard with his tender-hearted, sensitive  little daughter.\"    \"Don't blame him--my dear, dear father!\" she said, low and tremulously,  her face growing grave and almost sad for the moment. \"He was very strict,  it is true, but none too strict in the matter of requiring prompt and  implicit obedience, and oh, so kind, so loving, so tender, so  sympathizing. I could, and did go to him with every little childish joy  and sorrow, every trouble, vexation, and perplexity; always sure of  sympathy, and help, too, if needed. Never once did he repulse me, or show  himself an uninterested listener.    \"He would take me on his knee, hear all I had to say, clasp me close to  his heart, caress me, call me pet names, joy, sorrow with, or counsel me  as the case required, and bid me always come freely to him so, assuring me  that nothing which concerned me, one way or another, was too trivial to  interest him, and he would be glad to know I had not a thought or feeling  concealed from him. I doubt if even you, my friend, have ever known all  that papa has been and is to me: father, mother, everything--but  husband,\" she added with a blush and smile, as her eyes met the kindly,  tender look in his.    \"Ah, that is my blessed privilege,\" he whispered, drawing her closer to  him. \"My wife, my own precious little wife! God keep me from ever being  less tender, loving, sympathizing to you than your father has been.\"    \"I do not fear it, my husband. Oh, was ever woman so blessed with love as  I! Daughter, and wife! they are the sweetest of all names when addressed  to me by papa's lips and yours.\"    \"I ought not to find fault with his training, seeing what credit you do  it. However, you seemed to me as near perfection as possible before he  began. Ah, my little friend, for how many years I loved you with scarcely  a hope it would ever be returned in the way I wished. Indeed I can hardly  yet believe fully in my own happiness,\" he concluded with a joyous laugh.  The next day Elsie had the pleasure of showing her husband over the house  first, and then the estate.
