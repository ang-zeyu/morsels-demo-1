But she wanted the little girl, and sent Betty up with a message to that  effect, bidding her make haste, and as soon as she had attended to that  errand, brush up the broken glass and put it in the fire.    Betty ran nimbly up to the play-room, and putting her head in at the door,  said with a grin, \"Miss Gracie, yo' ma wants you down in de  dressin'-room.\"    \"What for?\" asked Gracie, with a frightened look.    \"Dunno, s'pect you fin' out when you gits dar.\"    \"Betty, you're a saucy thing,\" said Lulu.    \"S'pect mebbe I is, Miss Lu,\" returned the little maid with a broader grin  than before, apparently considering the remark quite complimentary, while  she held the door open for Gracie to pass out.    \"Miss Gracie,\" she asked, as she followed Grace down the stairs, \"what fo'  you shut ole Tab up in de dressin'-room? She's done gone an' broke Miss  Wilet's bottle what hab de stuff dat smell so nice, an' cose Miss Wilet  she don' like dat ar.\"    \"What makes you say I put her in there, Betty?\" said Gracie.    \"Kase I seed you, he, he, he!\"    \"Did you?\" asked Gracie, looking still more alarmed than at the summons to  the dressing-room. \"Don't tell mamma, Betty. I'll give you a penny and  help you make a frock for your doll if you won't.\"    Betty's only answer was a broad grin and a chuckle as she sprang past  Gracie and opened the door for her.    Violet, seated on the farther side of the room, looked up with her usual  sweet smile. \"See, Gracie dear, I am making a lace collar for you, and I  want to try it on to see if it fits.\"    \"Now, Betty, get a dust-pan and brush and sweep up that glass. Don't leave  the least bit of it on the carpet, lest some one should tramp on it and  cut her foot.\"    \"Some one has broken that cut-glass perfume bottle you have always admired  so much, Gracie. Aren't you sorry?\"    \"Yes, I am, mamma. I never touch your things when you're not here.\"    The words were out almost before Grace knew she meant to speak them, and  she was terribly frightened and ashamed. She had never thought she would  be guilty of telling a lie. She hung her head, her cheeks aflame.    Violet noted the child's confusion with a sorely troubled heart.    \"No, dear,\" she said very gently, \"I did not suspect you, but if ever you  should meet with an accident, or yield to temptation to do some mischief,  I hope you will come and tell me about it at once. You need not fear that  I will be severe with you, for I love you very dearly, little Gracie.\"    \"Perhaps it was the cat knocked it off the bureau, mamma,\" said the child,  speaking low and hesitatingly. \"I've seen her jump up there several  times.\"    \"Yes; so have I, and she must not be left alone in here any more.\"    Betty had finished her work and was sent away. Agnes, too, had left the  room, so that Violet and Gracie were quite alone.    \"Come, dear, I am quite ready to try this on.\" Violet said, holding up the  collar. \"There, it fits very nicely,\" as she put it on the child and  gently smoothed it down over her shoulders. \"But what is the matter, my  darling?\" for tears were trembling on the long silken lashes that swept  Gracie's flushed cheeks.    At the question they began to fall in streams, while the little bosom  heaved with sobs. She pulled out a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe  her eyes, and a strong whiff of perfume greeted Violet's nostrils, telling  a tale that sent a pang to her heart.    Gracie was instantly conscious of it, as she, too, smelled the tell-tale  perfume, and stole a glance at her young stepmother's face.    \"O mamma!\" she sobbed, covering her face with her hands, \"I did pour a  little on my handkerchief 'cause I knew you always let me have it, but I  didn't mean to break the bottle; it just slipped out o' my hands and fell  and broke.\"    Violet clasped her in her arms and wept bitterly over her.    \"Mamma, don't cry,\" sobbed the child, \"I'll save up all my money till I  can buy you another bottle, just like that.\"    \"O Gracie, Gracie, it is not that!\" Violet said, when emotion would let  her speak. \"I valued the bottle as the gift of my dear dead father, but I  would rather have lost it a hundred times over than have my darling tell a  lie. It is so wicked, so wicked! God hates lying. He says, 'All liars  shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.'  'He that speaketh lies shall not escape.' He says that Satan is the father  of lies, and that those who are guilty of lying are the children of that  wicked one.    \"Have you forgotten how God punished Gehazi for lying by making him a  leper, and struck Ananias and Sapphira dead for the same sin? O my  darling, my darling, it breaks my heart to think you have both acted and  spoken a falsehood!\" she cried, clasping the child still closer to her  bosom and weeping over her afresh.    Gracie, too, cried bitterly. \"Mamma, mamma,\" she said, \"will God never  forgive me? will He send me to that dreadful place?\"    \"He will forgive you if you are truly sorry for your sin because it is  dishonoring and displeasing to Him, and if you ask Him to pardon you for  Jesus' sake; and He will take away the evil nature that leads you to  commit sin, giving you a new and good heart, and take you to heaven when  you die.    \"But no one can go to heaven who is not first made holy. The Bible bids us  follow 'holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.' And Jesus is a  Saviour from sin. 'Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His  people from their sins.' Shall we kneel down now and ask Him to save you  from yours?\"    \"Yes, mamma,\" sobbed the child.    Violet's prayer was short and to the point. Then she held Gracie for some  time in her arms, while they mingled their tears together.    At length, \"Gracie dear,\" she said, \"I believe God has heard our prayer  and forgiven you. I am sure He has if you are truly sorry in your heart  and asked with it, and not only with your lips, for forgiveness; but I  want you to stay here alone for an hour and think it all over quietly, I  mean about your wrongdoing and God's willingness to forgive for Jesus'  sake, and that we could not have been forgiven and saved from sin and hell  if the dear Saviour had not died for us the cruel death of the cross.    \"Oh, think what a dreadful thing sin must be that it could not be blotted  out except by Jesus suffering and dying in our stead! And think how great  was His love for us, when He was willing to lay down His own life that we  might live!\"    Then with a kiss of tender motherly love, she went out and left the child  alone.    Gracie was sincerely penitent. She had always been taught that lying was a  dreadful sin, and had never before told a direct falsehood; but while in  her former home, Mrs. Scrimp's faulty management, joined to her own  natural timidity, had tempted her to occasional slyness and deceit, and  from these the descent to positive untruth was easy.    Violet's faithful dealing, and even more her evident deep distress because  of the sin against God of which her darling had been guilty, had so  convinced the child of the heinousness of her conduct that she was sorely  distressed because of it, and on being left alone, knelt down again and  pleaded for pardon with many bitter tears and sobs.    She had risen from her knees and was lying on a couch, still weeping, when  Lulu came into the room.    \"Why, Gracie, what is the matter?\" she asked, running to the couch and  bending over her little sister in tender concern.    \"Don't ask me, Lulu, I don't want to tell you,\" sobbed Gracie, turning  away her blushing, tear-stained face.    \"Mamma Vi has been scolding or punishing you for some little naughtiness,  I suppose,\" said Lulu, frowning.    \"No, she hasn't!\" cried Gracie indignantly; then hastily correcting  herself, \"except that she said she wanted me to stay here alone for a  while. So you must go and leave me.\"    \"I won't till you tell me what it was all about. What did you do? or was  it something you didn't do?\"    \"I don't want to tell you, 'cause you wouldn't ever do such a wicked  thing, and you--you'd despise me if you knew I'd done it,\" sobbed Gracie.    \"No, I wouldn't. You are better than I am. Papa said I was worse than you  and Max both put together. So you needn't mind my knowing.\"    \"I meddled and broke mamma's pretty bottle that her dead father gave her;  but she didn't scold me for that; not a bit; but--but 'cause I tried to  put the blame on puss, and--and said I--I never touched her things when  she wasn't here.\"    \"O Gracie, that _was_ wicked! to say what wasn't true! I think papa would  have whipped you, for I've heard him say if there was anything he would  punish severely in one of his children, it was falsehood. But don't cry  so. I'm sure you're sorry and won't ever do it again.\"    \"No, no! never, never! Mamma hugged me up in her arms and cried hard  'cause I'd been so wicked. And she asked Jesus to forgive me and make me  good, so I shouldn't have to go to that dreadful place. Now go away, Lu,  'cause she said I must stay alone.\"    \"Yes, I will; but stop crying or you'll be sick,\" Lulu said, kissing  Gracie, then left the room and went to her own to make herself neat before  going down to join the family at tea.    Her thoughts were busy with Gracie and her trouble while she brushed her  hair, washed her hands, and changed her dress. \"Poor, little weak thing,  she was frightened into it, of course, for it's the very first time she  ever told an untruth. I suppose Mamma Vi must have looked very cross about  the broken bottle; and she needn't, I'm sure, for she has plenty of money  to buy more. Such a shame! but I just knew she wouldn't always be kind to  us.\"    Thus Lulu worked herself up into a passion, quite forgetting, in her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#20)"],[1,"his brother had given him. When he reached the  entrance of the cavern, he pronounced the words, \"Open, Sesame!\" The  door immediately opened, and, when he was in, closed upon him. In  examining the cave, he was in great admiration to find much more riches  than he had expected from Ali Baba's relation. He quickly laid as many  bags of gold as he could carry at the door of the cavern; but his  thoughts were so full of the great riches he should possess, that he  could not think of the necessary word to make it open, but instead of  \"Sesame,\" said, \"Open, Barley!\" and was much amazed to find that the  door remained fast shut. He named several sorts of grain, but still the  door would not open.    Cassim had never expected such an incident, and was so alarmed at the  danger he was in, that the more he endeavoured to remember the word  \"Sesame,\" the more his memory was confounded, and he had as much  forgotten it as if he had never heard it mentioned. He threw down the  bags he had loaded himself with, and walked distractedly up and down the  cave, without having the least regard to the riches that were around  him.    About noon the robbers visited their cave. At some distance they saw  Cassim's mules straggling about the rock, with great chests on their  backs. Alarmed at this, they galloped full speed to the cave. They drove  away the mules, which strayed through the forest so far, that they were  soon out of sight, and went directly, with their naked sabres in their  hands, to the door, which, on their captain pronouncing the proper  words, immediately opened.    Cassim, who heard the noise of the horses' feet, at once guessed the  arrival of the robbers, and resolved to make one effort for his life. He  rushed to the door, and no sooner saw the door open, than he ran out and  threw the leader down, but could not escape the other robbers, who with  their scimitars soon deprived him of life.    The first care of the robbers after this was to examine the cave. They  found all the bags which Cassim had brought to the door, to be ready to  load his mules, and carried them again to their places, but they did not  miss what Ali Baba had taken away before. Then holding a council, and  deliberating upon this occurrence, they guessed that Cassim, when he was  in, could no get out again, but could not imagine how he had learned the  secret words by which alone he could enter. They could not deny the fact  of his being there; and to terrify any person or accomplice who should  attempt the same thing, they agreed to cut Cassim's body into four  quarters--to hang two on one side, and two on the other, within the door  of the cave. They had no sooner taken this resolution than they put it  in execution; and when they had nothing more to detain them, left the  place of their hoards well closed. They mounted their horses, went to  beat the roads again, and to attack the caravans they might meet.    In the mean time, Cassim's wife was very uneasy when night came, and her  husband was not returned. She ran to Ali Baba in great alarm, and said,  \"I believe, brother-in-law, that you know Cassim is gone to the forest,  and upon what account; it is now night, and he has not returned; I am  afraid some misfortune has happened to him.\" Ali Baba told her that she  need not frighten herself, for that certainly Cassim would not think it  proper to come into the town till the night should be pretty far  advanced.    Cassim's wife, considering how much it concerned her husband to keep the  business secret, was the more easily persuaded to believe her  brother-in-law. She went home again, and waited patiently till midnight.  Then her fear redoubled, and her grief was the more sensible because she  was forced to keep it to herself. She repented of her foolish curiosity,  and cursed her desire of prying into the affairs of her brother and  sister-in-law. She spent all the night in weeping; and as soon as it was  day went to them, telling them, by her tears, the cause of her coming.    Ali Baba did not wait for his sister-in-law to desire him to go to see  what was become of Cassim, but departed immediately with his three  asses, begging of her first to moderate her affliction. He went to the  forest, and when he came near the rock, having seen neither his brother  nor the mules in his way, was seriously alarmed at finding some blood  spilt near the door, which he took for an ill omen; but when he had  pronounced the word, and the door had opened, he was struck with horror  at the dismal sight of his brother's body. He was not long in  determining how he should pay the last dues to his brother; but without  adverting to the little fraternal affection he had shown for him, went  into the cave, to find something to enshroud his remains; and having  loaded one of his asses with them, covered them over with wood. The  other two asses he loaded with bags of gold, covering them with wood  also as before; and then bidding the door shut, came away; but was so  cautious as to stop some time at the end of the forest, that he might  not go into the town before night. When he came home, he drove the two  asses loaded with gold into his little yard, and left the care of  unloading them to his wife, while he led the other to his  sister-in-law's house.    Ali Baba knocked at the door, which was opened by Morgiana, a clever,  intelligent slave, who was fruitful in inventions to meet the most  difficult circumstances. When he came into the court, he unloaded the  ass, and taking Morgiana aside, said to her, \"You must observe an  inviolable secrecy. Your master's body is contained in these two  panniers. We must bury him as if he had died a natural death. Go now and  tell your mistress. I leave the matter to your wit and skilful devices.\"          Ali Baba helped to place the body in Cassim's house, again recommended  to Morgiana to act her part well, and then returned with his ass.    Morgiana went out early the next morning to a druggist, and asked for a  sort of lozenge which was considered efficacious in the most dangerous  disorders. The apothecary inquired who was ill? She replied, with a  sigh, \"Her good master Cassim himself: and that he could neither eat nor  speak.\" In the evening Morgiana went to the same druggist's again, and  with tears in her eyes, asked for an essence which they used to give to  sick people only when at the last extremity. \"Alas!\" said she, taking it  from the apothecary, \"I am afraid that this remedy will have no better  effect than the lozenges; and that I shall lose my good master.\"    On the other hand, as Ali Baba and his wife were often seen to go  between Cassim's and their own house all that day, and to seem  melancholy, nobody was surprised in the evening to hear the lamentable  shrieks and cries of Cassim's wife and Morgiana, who gave out everywhere  that her master was dead. The next morning at daybreak Morgiana went to  an old cobbler whom she knew to be always early at his stall, and  bidding him good-morrow, put a piece of gold into his hand, saying,  \"Baba Mustapha, you must bring with you your sewing tackle, and come  with me; but I must tell you, I shall blindfold you when you come to  such a place.\"    Baba Mustapha seemed to hesitate a little at these words. \"Oh! oh!\"  replied he, \"you would have me do something against my conscience, or  against my honour?\" \"God forbid,\" said Morgiana, putting another piece  of gold into his hand, \"that I should ask anything that is contrary to  your honour! only come along with me and fear nothing.\"    Baba Mustapha went with Morgiana, who, after she had bound his eyes with  a handkerchief at the place she had mentioned, conveyed him to her  deceased master's house, and never unloosed his eyes till he had entered  the room where she had put the corpse together. \"Baba Mustapha,\" said  she, \"you must make haste and sew the parts of this body together; and  when you have done, I will give you another piece of gold.\"    After Baba Mustapha had finished his task, she blindfolded him again,  gave him the third piece of gold as she had promised, and recommending  secrecy to him carried him back to the place where she first bound his  eyes, pulled off the bandage, and let him go home, but watched him that  he returned toward his stall, till he was quite out of sight, for fear  he should have the curiosity to return and dodge her; she then went  home. Morgiana, on her return, warmed some water to wash the body, and  at the same time Ali Baba perfumed it with incense, and wrapped it in  the burying clothes with the accustomed ceremonies. Not long after the  proper officer brought the bier, and when the attendants of the mosque,  whose business it was to wash the dead, offered to perform their duty,  she told them that it was done already. Shortly after this the imaun and  the other ministers of the mosque arrived. Four neighbours carried the  corpse to the burying-ground, following the imaun, who recited some  prayers. Ali Baba came after with some neighbours, who often relieved  the others in carrying the bier to the burying-ground. Morgiana, a slave  to the deceased, followed in the procession, weeping, beating her  breast, and tearing her hair. Cassim's wife stayed at home mourning,  uttering lamentable cries with the women of the neighbourhood, who came,  according to custom, during the funeral, and joining their lamentations  with hers filled the quarter far and near with sounds of sorrow.    In this manner Cassim's melancholy death was concealed and hushed up  between Ali Baba, his widow, and Morgiana, his slave, with so much  contrivance that nobody in the city had the least knowledge or suspicion  of the cause of it. Three or four days after the funeral, Ali Baba  removed his few goods openly to his sister-in-law's house, in which it  was agreed that he should in future live; but the money he had taken  from the robbers he conveyed thither by night.
