Again the Chief of a  small village containing 1000 men supplies 1000 kilogrammes of rubber  each month to the State for 50 centimes a kilo. To collect this amount  takes two or three days; each year therefore the village receives L240  for collecting a substance of no value at all to the natives whose daily  routine in the meantime is scarcely affected at all. The natives used  ivory chiefly to make war horns, but some of the Chiefs had so much that  they constructed fences of fine points round their mud huts little  thinking that in the white man's country, those useless tusks would be  worth a small mountain of salt. Now they exchange them for clothes,  cloth, salt, and other useful commodities. The lucky owner of a canoe,  it is true, can no longer buy three or four slaves with it, but he can  use it to transport produce or to catch fish, for which he is well paid.  Again compare the lot of the slave in the past with his present  condition. He was liable to the most terrible fate at any moment; now he  can enter the army, work in the plantations or remain safely in his  village and do a few hours' work each month. There is however, another  force acting which we should hardly expect would affect the mind of a  savage. He is greatly influenced by a desire to ascend the social  ladder at the summit of which, is of course, the white man, and anyone  having direct dealings with him, at once knows himself to be superior to  the naked cannibal of the forest. The servant, or _boy_, of the white  man, holds a high rank and considers himself to be quite another species  of man than his cousin, who is still uncivilised. So also the soldiers  and workers in the plantations, who come into daily contact with the  officials. All the most intelligent and ambitious natives are thus drawn  away from their primitive condition of life and become attached to their  masters, who give them cloth to wear and beads with which to beautify  themselves. The most important Chiefs are as anxious indeed to appear  like Europeans, as a prosperous native of Sierra Leone, is to wear  patent boots and carry a silk umbrella. There is one near here named  Bayer, a young man of much intelligence and business capacity, who has  built himself a brick house, dresses like a European, and is a proud man  when he is asked to smoke a cigar on the verandah of the mess. The  Chiefs are, however, never asked to eat with the Europeans, a  distinction which is both necessary and wise.    [Illustration: YOUNG SANGO GIRLS AT BANZYVILLE.]    It daily becomes more and more obvious that the white man is greatly  respected and that his word is absolutely trusted. What he says is true  and what he promises, he does. The native appears to respect these  characteristics perhaps all the more because he is so lamentably  deficient in them himself.    It is indeed the respect caused by moral not physical force which  enables a few Europeans to govern this great country with success, and  permits one or two white men to live securely with a few soldiers in an  isolated Post surrounded by thousands of natives most of whom are  savage cannibals.    There are, however, many difficulties yet to be surmounted, and among  them is the arrangement of a satisfactory currency. This was brought  home forcibly on October 1st when according to weekly custom, the people  in the villages around brought in food for the Post. Many women appeared  with large bunches of bananas for which as a rule, they are paid by  beads. In this prosperous part the heads of the women are already fully  adorned with beads and most of their household ornaments also, so they  demanded cloth instead.    The question of the currency is a very difficult one. There is the  danger of flooding the banks of the Congo with mitakos, and the banks of  the Ubangi with beads. In other words these articles which function as  money are not used as rapidly as they are supplied, and a lady whose  limbs are already weighted with brass rings and whose head is heavy with  beads, wishes for some other payment. There is a warehouse at each of  the State Posts in which cloth, clothes, beads, salt, and many other  commodities likely to be of use to the natives are kept, but it is  manifestly impossible to give as wages to each individual the particular  object he desires at the particular moment. The objection to beads and  mitakos, does not apply to salt and cloth, the former being at once  consumed, and the latter being worn out in course of time. Nevertheless  it is not well to have a currency which is continually being formed only  to be destroyed. The money currency, already existing in the Lower Congo  will, however, in course of time be extended, but there are still many  difficulties in the way. Francs and centimes will of course be of no  use to the natives, unless Stores are still kept at the State Posts at  which they can buy whatever they wish. This great question is, however,  occupying the careful attention of the Government, and will no doubt be  settled as satisfactorily as many others have been which were equally  difficult.    Sunday is always an interesting day in a State Post, for the Chiefs with  many followers come in for a friendly chat and to ask advice. October  2nd was particularly exciting for a new Chief had been elected in a  village near Banzyville, and great rejoicings consequently followed.  Singing, shouting, dancing and a general hubbub, went on from morning to  night, and if the desire to make a noise is any criterion of happiness,  these people must be the happiest in the world. There are many forms of  dances; sometimes each one shuffles his legs without moving more than a  foot or two and then swings his arms, head and body solemnly backwards  and forwards; sometimes a number will form a ring, and one after the  other will leap into it and rapidly rotate themselves; but whatever the  form, all seemed to be keenly excited and to enjoy it thoroughly.    The natives near the Ubangi have a very distinctive tatouage. It  consists of five elevated knobs of skin which form a straight line  continuing the line of the nose up the forehead. These are formed by  making for each knob two parallel incisions in the skin about half an  inch apart and lifting the flap between. A piece of ivory is then  inserted under the flap and left in until the wound has healed, the  result being a knob of skin elevated above the level of the rest of the  surface. All the tatouage in the Congo consists in raising the skin in  this manner, but in each district the design is different. Simple  tatooing by pricking in colours does not appear to be practised at all.    Fishing here is very simple and very effective. Large baskets tapering  to a point and open at the broad end are fixed by ropes, or rather by  the strong vines which function as ropes here, just at the top of the  rapids and the water rushes through with great force. The fish are  carried into the baskets, but cannot pass through or return against the  current, and are then simply speared and lifted out. They have firm,  white flesh and are good eating.    On October 3rd the Chief of the Banzas comes to the Post to call. He is  a fine, intelligent-looking man and rules his people, who are very  numerous, admirably. In this part of the Congo, the chieftainship  descends from father to son, but in some districts the succession passes  through the family of the wife of the Chief.    Numerous petty Chiefs drop in to the Post at intervals during the day  and are rather a nuisance, for they are always begging for clothes and  offering lances and presents in exchange. They do not realise that one  does not carry a superfluity of clothes when travelling, or that one or  two lances are quite sufficient to keep as curios. Probably they think  we are traders for we are not _bulamatadi_, and no one I believe, has  ever ascended the Ubangi on a pleasure tour before. The newly-elected  Chief was very anxious to be given a suit of clothes as he had none and  wished to make an impression on his new subjects. He described with many  gestures, that he was elected with much beating of drums, which indeed  was only too true and said he always intended to remain a great friend  of the State. After that, of course he had to be given some clothes. The  system of giving _tips_. indiscriminately is however, carried much too  far in the State, and if it is not stopped, will soon prove to be a very  heavy tax on the white man. Every native demands a tip on every possible  occasion whether he has done a service or not, and if he has done some  work and is only paid his due, is as discontented and abusive as a  cabman who has only received his legal fare.    There are many native thieves all over the Congo--one of them actually  penetrated into the house of Captain Auita at midday in bright sunshine  and stole a spear and a native knife. He was however, soon caught and  marched off to prison. Trials by ordeal used to be very common among the  natives. A favourite method was to give a dose of strychnine to a fowl  and if it died, the accused was guilty, but if it lived, he was  innocent. The wretched fowl, feeling in any case very ill, walked about  wondering at the excitement and followed by the complainant shouting  \"die, die, die, fowl\" and the defendant shouting \"live, live, live,  fowl.\" The strength of the solution was always arranged by the judge so  the verdict was known to him beforehand. A curious instrument to take  the place of a jury, is a nut through which a piece of fibre has been  passed in such a way, that when it is held vertically, the nut slides up  and down. By a curious twist of the fibre however, it is possible to  prevent the nut falling. At the trial, the nut is raised to the top of  the string and if it stays there, the accused is innocent, but if it  falls, he is guilty.

The Four Kings held a festival to celebrate their triumph, and having  drunk copiously gave themselves over to sleep. During the night Yang  Chien came out of the bag, with the intention of possessing himself of  the three magical weapons of the _Chin-kang_. But he succeeded only in  carrying off the umbrella of Mo-li Hung. In a subsequent engagement  No-cha, the son of Vadjra-pani, the God of Thunder, broke the jade  ring of Mo-li Ch'ing. Misfortune followed misfortune. The _Chin-kang_,  deprived of their magical weapons, began to lose heart. To complete  their discomfiture, Huang T'ien Hua brought to the attack a matchless  magical weapon. This was a spike 7 1/2 inches long, enclosed in a  silk sheath, and called 'Heart-piercer.' It projected so strong a  ray of light that eyes were blinded by it.    Huang T'ien Hua, hard pressed by Mo-li Ch'ing, drew the mysterious  spike from its sheath, and hurled it at his adversary. It entered  his neck, and with a deep groan the giant fell dead.    Mo-li Hung and Mo-li Hai hastened to avenge their brother, but ere  they could come within striking distance of Huang Ti'en Hua his  redoubtable spike reached their hearts, and they lay prone at his feet.    The one remaining hope for the sole survivor was in Hua-hu Tiao. Mo-li  Shou, not knowing that the creature had been slain, put his hand into  the bag to pull him out, whereupon Yang Chien, who had re-entered the  bag, bit his hand off at the wrist, so that there remained nothing  but a stump of bone.    In this moment of intense agony Mo-li Shou fell an easy prey to Huang  T'ien Hua, the magical spike pierced his heart, and he fell bathed  in his blood. Thus perished the last of the _Chin-kang_.        The Three Pure Ones    Turning to the gods of Taoism, we find that the triad or trinity,  already noted as forming the head of that hierarchy, consists of  three Supreme Gods, each in his own Heaven. These three Heavens,  the _San Ch'ing_, 'Three Pure Ones' (this name being also applied  to the sovereigns ruling in them), were formed from the three airs,  which are subdivisions of the one primordial air.    The first Heaven is Yue Ch'ing. In it reigns the first member of  the Taoist triad. He inhabits the Jade Mountain. The entrance to  his palace is named the Golden Door. He is the source of all truth,  as the sun is the source of all light.    Various authorities give his name differently--Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun,  or Lo Ching Hsin, and call him T'ien Pao, 'the Treasure of Heaven,'  Some state that the name of the ruler of this first Heaven is Yue  Huang, and in the popular mind he it is who occupies this supreme  position. The Three Pure Ones are above him in rank, but to him, the  Pearly Emperor, is entrusted the superintendence of the world. He has  all the power of Heaven and earth in his hands. He is the correlative  of Heaven, or rather Heaven itself.    The second Heaven, Shang Ch'ing, is ruled by the second person of  the triad, named Ling-pao T'ien-tsun, or Tao Chuen. No information is  given as to his origin. He is the custodian of the sacred books. He has  existed from the beginning of the world. He calculates time, dividing  it into different epochs. He occupies the upper pole of the world, and  determines the movements and interaction, or regulates the relations  of the _yin_ and the _yang_, the two great principles of nature.    In the third Heaven, T'ai Ch'ing, the Taoists place Lao Tzu, the  promulgator of the true doctrine drawn up by Ling-pao T'ien-tsun. He  is alternatively called Shen Pao, 'the Treasure of the Spirits,'  and T'ai-shang Lao-chun, 'the Most Eminent Aged Ruler.' Under various  assumed names he has appeared as the teacher of kings and emperors,  the reformer of successive generations.    This three-storied Taoist Heaven, or three Heavens, is the result of  the wish of the Taoists not to be out-rivalled by the Buddhists. For  Buddha, the Law, and the Priesthood they substitute the _Tao_, or  Reason, the Classics, and the Priesthood.    As regards the organization of the Taoist Heavens, Yue Huang has on his  register the name of eight hundred Taoist divinities and a multitude  of Immortals. These are all divided into three categories: Saints  (_Sheng-jen_), Heroes (_Chen-jen_), and Immortals (_Hsien-jen_),  occupying the three Heavens respectively in that order.      The Three Causes    Connected with Taoism, but not exclusively associated with that  religion, is the worship of the Three Causes, the deities presiding  over three departments of physical nature, Heaven, earth, and  water. They are known by various designations: _San Kuan_, 'the Three  Agents'; _San Yuean_, 'the Three Origins'; _San Kuan Ta Ti_, 'the Three  Great Emperor Agents'; and _T'ai Shang San Kuan_, 'the Three Supreme  Agents.' This worship has passed through four chief phases, as follows:    The first comprises Heaven, earth, and water, _T'ien, Ti, Shui_,  the sources of happiness, forgiveness of sins, and deliverance from  evil respectively. Each of these is called King-emperor. Their names,  written on labels and offered to Heaven (on a mountain), earth (by  burial), and water (by immersion), are supposed to cure sickness. This  idea dates from the Han dynasty, being first noted about A.D. 172.    The second, _San Yuean_ dating from A.D. 407 under the Wei dynasty,  identified the Three Agents with three dates of which they were  respectively made the patrons. The year was divided into three unequal  parts: the first to the seventh moon; the seventh to the tenth; and  the tenth to the twelfth. Of these, the fifteenth day of the first,  seventh, and tenth moons respectively became the three principal dates  of these periods. Thus the Agent of Heaven became the principal patron  of the first division, honoured on the fifteenth day of the first moon,  and so on.    The third phase, _San Kuan_, resulted from the first two being found  too complicated for popular favour. The _San Kuan_ were the three  sons of a man, Ch'en Tzu-ch'un, who was so handsome and intelligent  that the three daughters of Lung Wang, the Dragon-king, fell in  love with him and went to live with him. The eldest girl was the  mother of the Superior Cause, the second of the Medium Cause, and the  third of the Inferior Cause. All these were gifted with supernatural  powers. Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun canonized them as the Three Great Emperor  Agents of Heaven, earth, and water, governors of all beings, devils  or gods, in the three regions of the universe. As in the first phase,  the _T'ien Kuan_ confers happiness, the _Ti Kuan_ grants remission  of sins, and the _Shui Kuan_ delivers from evil or misfortune.    The fourth phase consisted simply in the substitution by the priests  for the abstract or time-principles of the three great sovereigns  of ancient times, Yao, Shun, and Yue. The _literati_, proud of the  apotheosis of their ancient rulers, hastened to offer incense to them,  and temples, _San Yuean Kung_, arose in very many parts of the Empire.    A variation of this phase is the canonization, with the title of _San  Yuean_ or Three Causes, of _Wu-k'o San Chen Chuen_, 'the Three True  Sovereigns, Guests of the Kingdom of Wu.' They were three Censors  who lived in the reign of King Li (Li Wang, 878-841 B.C.) of the Chou  dynasty. Leaving the service of the Chou on account of Li's dissolute  living, they went to live in Wu, and brought victory to that state in  its war with the Ch'u State, then returned to their own country, and  became pillars of the Chou State under Li's successor. They appeared  to protect the Emperor Chen Tsung when he was offering the _Feng-shan_  sacrifices on T'ai Shan in A.D. 1008, on which occasion they were  canonized with the titles of Superior, Medium, and Inferior Causes,  as before, conferring upon them the regencies of Heaven, earth,  and water respectively.      Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun    Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun, or the First Cause, the Highest in Heaven,  generally placed at the head of the Taoist triad, is said never  to have existed but in the fertile imagination of the Lao Tzuist  sectarians. According to them Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun had neither origin  nor master, but is himself the cause of all beings, which is why he  is called the First Cause.    As first member of the triad, and sovereign ruler of the First Heaven,  Yue Ch'ing, where reign the saints, he is raised in rank above all  the other gods. The name assigned to him is Lo Ching Hsin. He was  born before all beginnings; his substance is imperishable; it is  formed essentially of uncreated air, air _a se_, invisible and without  perceptible limits. No one has been able to penetrate to the beginnings  of his existence. The source of all truth, he at each renovation of  the worlds--that is, at each new _kalpa_--gives out the mysterious  doctrine which confers immortality. All who reach this knowledge  attain by degrees to life eternal, become refined like the spirits,  or instantly become Immortals, even while upon earth.    Originally, Yuean-shih T'ien-tsun was not a member of the Taoist  triad. He resided above the Three Heavens, above the Three Pure  Ones, surviving the destructions and renovations of the universe,  as an immovable rock in the midst of a stormy sea. He set the stars  in motion, and caused the planets to revolve. The chief of his secret  police was Tsao Chuen, the Kitchen-god, who rendered to him an account  of the good and evil deeds of each family. His executive agent was  Lei Tsu, the God of Thunder, and his subordinates. The seven stars  of the North Pole were the palace of his ministers, whose offices  were on the various sacred mountains. Nowadays, however, Yuean-shih  T'ien-tsun is generally neglected for Yue Huang.      An Avatar of P'an Ku    According to the tradition of Chin Hung, the God of T'ai Shan  of the fifth generation from P'an Ku, this being, then called  Yuean-shih T'ien-wang,"]]]
