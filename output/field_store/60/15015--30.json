Men will remain unjust when the season of love is gone over.  Yes, my Hermann, thy father's old age thou greatly canst gladden,  If thou a daughter-in-law will speedily bring to my dwelling,  Out of the neighborhood here,--from the house over yonder, the green one.  Rich is the man, I can tell thee. His manufactures and traffic  Daily are making him richer; for whence draws the merchant not profit?  Three daughters only he has, to divide his fortune among them.  True that the eldest already is taken; but there is the second  Still to be had, as well as the third; and not long so, it may be.  I would never have lingered till now, had I been in thy place;  But had fetched one of the maidens, as once I bore off thy dear mother.\"    Modestly then did the son to the urgent father make answer:  \"Truly 'twas my wish too, as well as thine own, to have chosen  One of our neighbor's daughters, for we had been brought up together;  Played, in the early days, about the market-place fountain;  And, from the other boys' rudeness, I often have been their defender.  That, though, is long since past: the girls, as they grew to be older,  Properly stayed in the house, and shunned the more boisterous pastimes.  Well brought up are they, surely! I used sometimes to go over,  Partly to gratify thee, and because of our former acquaintance:  But no pleasure I ever could take in being among them;  For I was always obliged to endure their censures upon me.  Quite too long was my coat, the cloth too coarse, and the color  Quite too common; my hair was not cropped, as it should be, and frizzled.  I was resolved, at last, that I, also, would dress myself finely,  Just as those office-boys do who always are seen there on Sundays,  Wearing in summer their half-silken flaps, that dangle about them;  But I discovered, betimes, they made ever a laughing-stock of me.  And I was vexed when I saw it,--it wounded my pride; but more deeply  Felt I aggrieved that they the good-will should so far misinterpret  That in my heart I bore them,--especially Minna the youngest.  It was on Easter-day that last I went over to see them;  Wearing my best new coat, that is now hanging up in the closet,  And having frizzled my hair, like that of the other young fellows.  Soon as I entered, they tittered; but that not at me, as I fancied.  Minna before the piano was seated; the father was present,  Hearing his daughters sing, and full of delight and good-humor.  Much I could not understand of all that was said in the singing;  But of Pamina I often heard, and oft of Tamino:  And I, besides, could not stay there dumb; so, as soon as she ended,  Something about the words I asked, and about the two persons.  Thereupon all were silent and smiled; but the father made answer:  'Thou knowest no one, my friend, I believe, but Adam and Eve?'  No one restrained himself longer, but loud laughed out then the maidens,  Loud laughed out the boys, the old man held his sides for his laughing.  I, in embarrassment, dropped my hat, and the giggling continued,  On and on and on, for all they kept playing and singing.  Back to the house here I hurried, o'ercome with shame and vexation,  Hung up my coat in the closet, and pulled out the curls with my fingers,  Swearing that never again my foot should cross over that threshold.  And I was perfectly right; for vain are the maidens, and heartless.  E'en to this day, as I hear, I am called by them ever 'Tamino.'\"    Thereupon answered the mother, and said: \"Thou shouldest not, Hermann,  Be so long vexed with the children: indeed, they are all of them children.  Minna, believe me, is good, and was always disposed to thee kindly.  'Twas not long since she was asking about thee. Let her be thy chosen!\"    Thoughtfully answered the son: \"I know not. That mortification  Stamped itself in me so deeply, I never could bear to behold her  Seated before the piano or listen again to her singing.\"    Forth broke the father then, and in words of anger made answer:  \"Little of joy will my life have in thee! I said it would be so  When I perceived that thy pleasure was solely in horses and farming:  Work which a servant, indeed, performs for an opulent master,  That thou doest; the father meanwhile must his son be deprived of,  Who should appear as his pride, in the sight of the rest of the townsmen.  Early with empty hopes thy mother was wont to deceive me,  When in the school thy studies, thy reading and writing, would never  As with the others succeed, but thy seat would be always the lowest.  That comes about, forsooth, when a youth has no feeling of honor  Dwelling within his breast, nor the wish to raise himself higher.  Had but my father so cared for me as thou hast been cared for;  If he had sent me to school, and provided me thus with instructors,  I should be other, I trow, than host of the Golden Lion!\"    Then the son rose from his seat and noiselessly moved to the doorway,  Slowly, and speaking no word. The father, however, in passion  After him called, \"Yes, go, thou obstinate fellow! I know thee!  Go and look after the business henceforth, that I have not to chide thee;  But do thou nowise imagine that ever a peasant-born maiden  Thou for a daughter-in-law shalt bring into my dwelling, the hussy!  Long have I lived in the world, and know how mankind should be dealt with;  Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen so that contented  They shall depart from my house, and strangers agreeably can flatter.  Yet I'm resolved that some day I one will have for a daughter,  Who shall requite me in kind and sweeten my manifold labors;  Who the piano shall play to me, too; so that there shall with pleasure  All the handsomest people in town and the finest assemble,  As they on Sundays do now in the house of our neighbor.\" Here Hermann  Softly pressed on the latch, and so went out from the chamber.      THALIA    THE CITIZENS    Thus did the modest son slip away from the angry up-braiding;  But in the tone he had taken at first, the father continued:  \"That comes not out of a man which he has not in him; and hardly  Shall the joy ever be mine of seeing my dearest wish granted:  That my son may not as his father be, but a better.  What would become of the house, and what of the city if each one  Were not with pleasure and always intent on maintaining, renewing,  Yea, and improving, too, as time and the foreigner teach us!  Man is not meant, forsooth, to grow from the ground like a mushroom,  Quickly to perish away on the spot of ground that begot him,  Leaving no trace behind of himself and his animate action!  As by the house we straightway can tell the mind of the master,  So, when we walk through a city, we judge of the persons who rule it.  For where the towers and walls are falling to ruin; where offal  Lies in heaps in the gutters, and alleys with offal are littered;  Where from its place has started the stone, and no one resets it;  Where the timbers are rotting away, and the house is awaiting  Vainly its new supports,--that place we may know is ill governed.  Since if not from above work order and cleanliness downward,  Easily grows the citizen used to untidy postponement;  Just as the beggar grows likewise used to his ragged apparel.  Therefore I wished that our Hermann might early set out on some travels;  That he at least might behold the cities of Strasburg and Frankfort,  Friendly Mannheim, too, that is cheerful and evenly builded.  He that has once beheld cities so cleanly and large, never after  Ceases his own native city, though small it may be, to embellish.  Do not the strangers who come here commend the repairs in our gateway,  Notice our whitewashed tower, and the church we have newly rebuilded?  Are not all praising our pavement? the covered canals full of water,  Laid with a wise distribution, which furnish us profit and safety,  So that no sooner does fire break out than 'tis promptly arrested?  Has not all this come to pass since the time of our great conflagration?  Builder I six times was named by the council, and won the approval,  Won moreover the heartfelt thanks of all the good burghers,  Actively carrying out what I planned, and also fulfilling  What had by upright men been designed, and left uncompleted.  Finally grew the same zeal in every one of the council;  All now labor together, and firmly decided already  Stands it to build the new causeway that shall with the high-road                                                       connect us.  But I am sorely afraid that will not be the way with our children.  Some think only of pleasure and perishable apparel;  Others will cower at home, and behind the stove will sit brooding.  One of this kind, as I fear, we shall find to the last in our Hermann.\"    Straightway answered and said the good and intelligent mother:  \"Why wilt thou always, father, be doing our son such injustice?  That least of all is the way to bring thy wish to fulfilment.  We have no power to fashion our children as suiteth our fancy;  As they are given by God, we so must have them and love them;  Teach them as best we can, and let each of them follow his nature.  One will have talents of one sort, and different talents another.  Every one uses his own; in his own individual fashion,  Each must be happy and good. I will not have my Hermann found fault with;  For he is worthy, I know, of the goods he shall one day inherit;  Will be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and builders;  Neither in council, as I can foresee, will he be the most backward.  But thou keepest shut up in his breast all the poor fellow's spirit,  Finding such fault with him daily, and censuring as thou but now hast.\"  And on the instant she quitted the room, and after him hurried,  Hoping she somewhere might find him, and might with her words of affection  Cheer him again, her excellent son, for well he deserved it.    Thereupon when she was gone, the father thus smiling continued:  \"What a strange folk,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#20)"],[1,"suicide; but  you can never tell. The importance of the case at present arises  entirely from the heavy insurance; a verdict of suicide will mean a gain  of ten thousand pounds to the 'Griffin,' so, naturally, the directors  are anxious to get the case settled and not inclined to boggle over a  little expense.\"    \"Naturally. And when will the expedition take place?\" I asked.    \"The inquest is fixed for to-morrow--what is the matter? Does that fall  foul of any arrangement of yours?\"    \"Oh, nothing of any importance,\" I replied hastily, deeply ashamed of  the momentary change of countenance that my friend had been so quick to  observe.    \"Well, what is it?\" persisted Thorndyke. \"You have got something on.\"    \"It is nothing, I tell you, but what can be quite easily arranged to  suit your plans.\"    \"_Cherchez la_--h'm?\" queried Thorndyke, with an exasperating grin.    \"Yes,\" I answered, turning as red as a pickled cabbage; \"since you are  so beastly inquisitive. Miss Gibson wrote, on behalf of Mrs. Hornby,  asking me to dine with them _en famille_ to-morrow evening, and I sent  off an acceptance an hour ago.\"    \"And you call that 'nothing of any importance'!\" exclaimed Thorndyke.  \"Alas! and likewise alackaday (which is an approximately synonymous  expression)! The age of chivalry is past, indeed. Of course you must  keep your appointment; I can manage quite well alone.\"    \"We shouldn't be back early enough for me to go to Kensington from the  station, I suppose?\"    \"No; certainly not. I find that the trains are very awkward; we should  not reach King's Cross until nearly one in the morning.\"    \"Then, in that case, I shall write to Miss Gibson and excuse myself.\"    \"Oh, I wouldn't do that,\" said Thorndyke; \"it will disappoint them, and  really it is not necessary.\"    \"I shall write forthwith,\" I said firmly, \"so please don't try to  dissuade me. I have been feeling quite uncomfortable at the thought  that, all the time I have been in your employ, I seem to have done  nothing but idle about and amuse myself. The opportunity of doing  something tangible for my wage is too precious to be allowed to slip.\"    Thorndyke chuckled indulgently. \"You shall do as you please, my dear  boy,\" he said; \"but don't imagine that you have been eating the bread of  idleness. When you see this Hornby case worked out in detail, you will  be surprised to find how large a part you have taken in unravelling it.  Your worth to me has been far beyond your poor little salary, I can  assure you.\"    \"It is very handsome of you to say that,\" I said, highly gratified to  learn that I was really of use, and not, as I had begun to suspect, a  mere object of charity.    \"It is perfectly true,\" he answered; \"and now, since you are going to  help me in this case, I will set you your task. The case, as I have  said, appears to be quite simple, but it never does to take the  simplicity for granted. Here is the letter from the solicitors giving  the facts as far as they are known at present. On the shelves there you  will find Casper, Taylor, Guy and Ferrier, and the other authorities on  medical jurisprudence, and I will put out one or two other books that  you may find useful. I want you to extract and make classified notes of  everything that may bear on such a case as the present one may turn out  to be. We must go prepared to meet any contingency that may arise. This  is my invariable practice, and even if the case turns out to be quite  simple, the labour is never wasted, for it represents so much experience  gained.\"    \"Casper and Taylor are pretty old, aren't they?\" I objected.    \"So is suicide,\" he retorted drily. \"It is a capital mistake to neglect  the old authorities. 'There were strong men before Agamemnon,' and some  of them were uncommonly strong, let me tell you. Give your best  attention to the venerable Casper and the obsolete Taylor and you will  not be without your reward.\"    As a result of these injunctions, I devoted the remainder of the day to  the consideration of the various methods by which a man might contrive  to effect his exit from the stage of human activities. And a very  engrossing study I found it, and the more interesting in view of the  problem that awaited solution on the morrow; but yet not so engrossing  but that I was able to find time to write a long, rather intimate and  minutely explanatory letter to Miss Gibson, in which I even mentioned  the hour of our return as showing the impossibility of my keeping my  engagement. Not that I had the smallest fear of her taking offence, for  it is an evidence of my respect and regard for her that I cancelled the  appointment without a momentary doubt that she would approve of my  action; but it was pleasant to write to her at length and to feel the  intimacy of keeping her informed of the details of my life.    The case, when we came to inquire into it on the spot, turned out to be  a suicide of the most transparent type; whereat both Thorndyke and I  were, I think, a little disappointed--he at having apparently done so  little for a very substantial fee, and I at having no opportunity for  applying my recently augmented knowledge.    \"Yes,\" said my colleague, as we rolled ourselves up in our rugs in  adjacent corners of the railway carriage, \"it has been a flat affair,  and the whole thing could have been managed by the local solicitor. But  it is not a waste of time after all, for, you see, I have to do many a  day's work for which I get not a farthing of payment, nor even any  recognition, so that I do not complain if I occasionally find myself  receiving more payment than my actual services merit. And as to you, I  take it that you have acquired a good deal of valuable knowledge on the  subject of suicide, and knowledge, as the late Lord Bacon remarked with  more truth than originality, is power.\"    To this I made no reply, having just lit my pipe and feeling uncommonly  drowsy; and, my companion having followed my example, we smoked in  silence, becoming more and more somnolent, until the train drew up in  the terminus and we turned out, yawning and shivering, on to the  platform.    \"Bah!\" exclaimed Thorndyke, drawing his rug round his shoulders; \"this  is a cheerless hour--a quarter past one. See how chilly and miserable  all these poor devils of passengers look. Shall we cab it or walk?\"    \"I think a sharp walk would rouse our circulation after sitting huddled  up in the carriage for so long,\" I answered.    \"So do I,\" said Thorndyke, \"so let us away; hark forward! and also Tally  Ho! In fact one might go so far as to say Yoicks! That gentleman appears  to favour the strenuous life, if one may judge by the size of his  sprocket-wheel.\"    He pointed to a bicycle that was drawn up by the kerb in the approach--a  machine of the road-racer type, with an enormous sprocket-wheel,  indicating a gear of, at least, ninety.    \"Some scorcher or amateur racer, probably,\" I said, \"who takes the  opportunity of getting a spin on the wood pavement when the streets are  empty.\" I looked round to see if I could identify the owner, but the  machine appeared to be, for the moment, taking care of itself.  King's  Cross is one of those districts of which the inhabitants are slow in  settling down for the night, and even at a quarter past one in the  morning its streets are not entirely deserted. Here and there the  glimmer of a street lamp or the far-reaching ray from a tall electric  light reveals the form of some nocturnal prowler creeping along with  cat-like stealthiness, or bursting, cat-like, into unmelodious song. Not  greatly desirous of the society of these roysterers, we crossed quickly  from the station into the Gray's Inn Road, now silent and excessively  dismal in aspect, and took our way along the western side. We had turned  the curve and were crossing Manchester Street, when a series of yelps  from ahead announced the presence of a party of merry-makers, whom we  were not yet able to see, however, for the night was an exceptionally  dark one; but the sounds of revelry continued to increase in volume as  we proceeded, until, as we passed Sidmouth Street, we came in sight of  the revellers. They were some half-dozen in number, all of them roughs  of the hooligan type, and they were evidently in boisterous spirits,  for, as they passed the entrance to the Royal Free Hospital, they halted  and battered furiously at the gate. Shortly after this exploit they  crossed the road on to our side, whereupon Thorndyke caught my arm and  slackened his pace.    \"Let them draw ahead,\" said he. \"It is a wise precaution to give all  hooligan gangs a very wide berth at this time of night. We had better  turn down Heathcote Street and cross Mecklenburgh Square.\"    We continued to walk on at reduced speed until we reached Heathcote  Street, into which we turned and so entered Mecklenburgh Square, where  we mended our pace once more.    \"The hooligan,\" pursued Thorndyke, as we walked briskly across the  silent square, \"covers a multitude of sins, ranging from highway robbery  with violence and paid assassination (technically known as 'bashing')  down to the criminal folly of the philanthropic magistrate, who seems to  think that his function in the economy of nature is to secure the  survival of the unfittest. There goes a cyclist along Guildford Street.  I wonder if that is our strenuous friend from the station. If so, he has  slipped past the hooligans.\"    We were just entering Doughty Street, and, as Thorndyke spoke, a man on  a bicycle was visible for an instant at the crossing of the two streets.  When we reached Guildford Street we both looked down the long,  lamp-lighted vista, but the cyclist had vanished.    \"We had better go straight on into Theobald's Road,\" said Thorndyke, and  we accordingly pursued our way up the fine old-world street, from whose  tall houses our footfalls echoed, so that we seemed to be accompanied by  an invisible multitude,"]]]
