The Austrian commander,  Sebottendorf, now hastily ranged his men along the eastern bank of the  river, so as to defend the bridge and prevent any passage of the river  by boats or by a ford above the town. The Imperialists numbered only  9,627 men; they were discouraged by defeats and by the consciousness  that no serious stand could be attempted before they reached the  neighbourhood of Mantua; and their efforts to break down the bridge  were now frustrated by the French, who, posted behind the walls of  Lodi on the higher bank of the stream, swept their opponents' position  with a searching artillery fire. Having shaken the constancy of his  foes and refreshed his own infantry by a brief rest in Lodi, Bonaparte  at 6 p.m. secretly formed a column of his choicest troops and hurled  it against the bridge. A hot fire of grapeshot and musketry tore its  front, and for a time the column bent before the iron hail. But,  encouraged by the words of their young leader, generals, corporals,  and grenadiers pressed home their charge. This time, aided by  sharp-shooters who waded to islets in the river, the assailants  cleared the bridge, bayoneted the Austrian cannoneers, attacked the  first and second lines of supporting foot, and, when reinforced,  compelled horse and foot to retreat towards Mantua.[46]  Such was the affair of Lodi (May 10th). A legendary  glamour hovers around all the details of this conflict and invests it  with fictitious importance. Beaulieu's main force was far away, and  there was no hope of entrapping anything more than the rear of his  army. Moreover, if this were the object, why was not the flank move of  the French cavalry above Lodi pushed home earlier in the fight? This,  if supported by infantry, could have outflanked the enemy while the  perilous rush was made against the bridge; and such a turning movement  would probably have enveloped the Austrian force while it was being  shattered in front. That is the view in which the strategist,  Clausewitz, regards this encounter. Far different was the impression  which it created among the soldiers and Frenchmen at large. They  valued a commander more for bravery of the bull-dog type than for any  powers of reasoning and subtle combination. These, it is true,  Bonaparte had already shown. He now enchanted the soldiery by dealing  a straight sharp blow. It had a magical effect on their minds. On the  evening of that day the French soldiers, with antique republican  _camaraderie_, saluted their commander as _le petit caporal_ for his  personal bravery in the fray, and this endearing phrase helped to  immortalize the affair of the bridge of Lodi.[47] It shot a thrill of  exultation through France. With pardonable exaggeration, men told how  he charged at the head of the column, and, with Lannes, was the first  to reach the opposite side; and later generations have figured him  charging before his tall grenadiers--a feat that was actually  performed by Lannes, Berthier, Massena, Cervoni, and Dallemagne. It  was all one. Bonaparte alone was the hero of the day. He reigned  supreme in the hearts of the soldiers, and he saw the importance of  this conquest. At St. Helena he confessed to Montholon that it was the  victory of Lodi which fanned his ambition into a steady flame.    A desire of stimulating popular enthusiasm throughout Italy impelled  the young victor to turn away from his real objective, the fortress of  Mantua, to the political capital of Lombardy. The people of Milan  hailed their French liberators with enthusiasm: they rained flowers on  the bronzed soldiers of liberty, and pointed to their tattered  uniforms and worn-out shoes as proofs of their triumphant energy:  above all, they gazed with admiration, not unmixed with awe, at the  thin pale features of the young commander, whose plain attire bespoke  a Spartan activity, whose ardent gaze and decisive gestures proclaimed  a born leader of men. Forthwith he arranged for the investment of the  citadel where eighteen hundred Austrians held out: he then received  the chief men of the city with easy Italian grace; and in the evening  he gave a sumptuous ball, at which all the dignity, wealth, and beauty  of the old Lombard capital shone resplendent. For a brief space all  went well between the Lombards and their liberators. He received with  flattering distinction the chief artists and men of letters, and also  sought to quicken the activity of the University of Pavia. Political  clubs and newspapers multiplied throughout Lombardy; and actors,  authors, and editors joined in a paean of courtly or fawning praise, to  the new Scipio, Caesar, Hannibal, and Jupiter.    There were other reasons why the Lombards should worship the young  victor. Apart from the admiration which a gifted race ever feels for  so fascinating a combination of youthful grace with intellectual power  and martial prowess, they believed that this Italian hero would call  the people to political activity, perchance even to national  independence. For this their most ardent spirits had sighed,  conspired, or fought during the eighty-three years of the Austrian  occupation. Ever since the troublous times of Dante there had been  prophetic souls who caught the vision of a new Italy, healed of her  countless schisms, purified from her social degradations, and uniting  the prowess of her ancient life with the gentler arts of the present  for the perfection of her own powers and for the welfare of mankind.  The gleam of this vision had shone forth even amidst the thunder claps  of the French Revolution; and now that the storm had burst over the  plains of Lombardy, ecstatic youths seemed to see the vision embodied  in the person of Bonaparte himself. At the first news of the success  at Lodi the national colours were donned as cockades, or waved  defiance from balconies and steeples to the Austrian garrisons. All  truly Italian hearts believed that the French victories heralded the  dawn of political freedom not only for Lombardy, but for the whole  peninsula.    Bonaparte's first actions increased these hopes. He abolished the  Austrian machinery of government, excepting the Council of State, and  approved the formation of provisional municipal councils and of a  National Guard. At the same time, he wrote guardedly to the Directors  at Paris, asking whether they proposed to organize Lombardy as a  republic, as it was much more ripe for this form of government than  Piedmont. Further than this he could not go; but at a later date he  did much to redeem his first promises to the people of Northern Italy.    The fair prospect was soon overclouded by the financial measures urged  on the young commander from Paris, measures which were disastrous to  the Lombards and degrading to the liberators themselves. The Directors  had recently bidden him to press hard on the Milanese, and levy large  contributions in money, provisions, and objects of art, seeing that  they did not intend to keep this country.[48] Bonaparte accordingly  issued a proclamation (May 19th), imposing on Lombardy the sum of  twenty million francs, remarking that it was a very light sum for so  fertile a country. Only two days before he had in a letter to the  Directors described it as exhausted by five years of war. As for the  assertion that the army needed this sum, it may be compared with his  private notification to the Directory, three days after his  proclamation, that they might speedily count on six to eight millions  of the Lombard contribution, as lying ready at their disposal, \"it  being over and above what the army requires.\" This is the first  definite suggestion by Bonaparte of that system of bleeding conquered  lands for the benefit of the French Exchequer, which enabled him  speedily to gain power over the Directors. Thenceforth they began to  connive at his diplomatic irregularities, and even to urge on his  expeditions into wealthy districts, provided that the spoils went to  Paris; while the conqueror, on his part, was able tacitly to assume  that tone of authority with which the briber treats the bribed.[49]    The exaction of this large sum, and of various requisites for the  army, as well as the \"extraction\" of works of art for the benefit of  French museums, at once aroused the bitterest feelings. The loss of  priceless treasures, such as the manuscript of Virgil which had  belonged to Petrarch, and the masterpieces of Raphael and Leonardo da  Vinci, might perhaps have been borne: it concerned only the cultured  few, and their effervescence was soon quelled by patrols of French  cavalry. Far different was it with the peasants between Milan and  Pavia. Drained by the white-coats, they now refused to be bled for the  benefit of the blue-coats of France. They rushed to arms. The city of  Pavia defied the attack of a French column until cannon battered in  its gates. Then the republicans rushed in, massacred all the armed men  for some hours, and glutted their lust and rapacity. By order of  Bonaparte, the members of the municipal council were condemned to  execution; but a delay occurred before this ferocious order was  carried out, and it was subsequently mitigated. Two hundred hostages  were, however, sent away into France as a guarantee for the good  behaviour of the unfortunate city: whereupon the chief announced to  the Directory that this would serve as a useful lesson to the peoples  of Italy.    In one sense this was correct. It gave the Italians a true insight  into French methods; and painful emotions thrilled the peoples of the  peninsula when they realized at what a price their liberation was to  be effected. Yet it is unfair to lay the chief blame on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#20)"],[1,"strangers to  whom she is introduced.      =HOW TO SIT GRACEFULLY=    Having shaken hands with the hostess, the visitor, whether a lady or a  gentleman, looks about quietly, without hurry, for a convenient chair to  sit down upon, or drop into. To sit gracefully one should not perch  stiffly on the edge of a straight chair, nor sprawl at length in an easy  one. The perfect position is one that is easy, but dignified. In other  days, no lady of dignity ever crossed her knees, held her hands on her  hips, or twisted herself sideways, or even _leaned back in her chair!_  To-day all these things are done; and the only etiquette left is on the  subject of how not to exaggerate them. No lady should cross her knees so  that her skirts go up to or above them; neither should her foot be thrust  out so that her toes are at knee level. An arm a-kimbo is _not_ a graceful  attitude, nor is a twisted spine! Everyone, of course, leans against a  chair back, except in a box at the opera and in a ballroom, but a lady  should never throw herself almost at full length in a reclining chair or  on a wide sofa when she is out in public. Neither does a gentleman in  paying a formal visit sit on the middle of his backbone with one ankle  supported on the other knee, and both as high as his head.    The proper way for a lady to sit is in the center of her chair, or  slightly sideways in the corner of a sofa. She may lean back, of course,  and easily; her hands relaxed in her lap, her knees together, or if  crossed, her foot must not be thrust forward so as to leave a space  between the heel and her other ankle. On informal occasions she can lean  back in an easy chair with her hands on the arms. In a ball dress a lady  of distinction never leans back in a chair; one can not picture a  beautiful and high-bred woman, wearing a tiara and other ballroom jewels,  leaning against anything. This is, however, not so much a rule of  etiquette as a question of beauty and fitness.    A gentleman, also on very formal occasions, should sit in the center of  his chair; but unless it is a deep lounging one, he always leans against  the back and puts a hand or an elbow on its arms.      =POSTSCRIPTS ON VISITS=    A lady never calls on another under the sponsorship of a gentleman--unless  he is her husband or father. A young girl can very properly go with her  fiance to return visit paid to her by members or friends of his family;  but she should not pay an initial visit unless to an invalid who has  written her a note asking her to do so.    If, when arriving at a lady's house, you find her motor at the door, you  should leave your card as though she were not at home. If she happens to  be in the hall, or coming down the steps, you say \"I see you are going  out, and I won't keep you!\"    If she insists on your coming in, you should stay only a moment. Do not,  however, fidget and talk about leaving. Sit down as though your leaving  immediately were not on your mind, but after two or three minutes say  \"Good-by\" and go.    A young man may go to see a young girl as often as he feels inclined and  she cares to receive him. If she continually asks to be excused, or shows  him scant attention when he is talking to her, or in any other way  indicates that he annoys or bores her, his visits should cease.    It is very bad manners to invite one person to your house and leave out  another with whom you are also talking. You should wait for an opportunity  when the latter is not included in your conversation.    In good society ladies do not kiss each other when they meet either at  parties or in public.    It is well to remember that nothing more blatantly stamps an ill-bred  person than the habit of patting, nudging or taking hold of people. \"Keep  your hands to yourself!\" might almost be put at the head of the first  chapter of every book on etiquette.    Be very chary of making any such remarks as \"I am afraid I have stayed too  long,\" or \"I must apologize for hurrying off,\" or \"I am afraid I have  bored you to death talking so much.\" All such expressions are  self-conscious and stupid. If you really think you are staying too long or  leaving too soon or talking too much--don't!      =AN INVALID'S VISIT BY PROXY=    It is not necessary that an invalid make any attempt to return the visits  to her friends who are attentive enough to go often to see her. But if a  stranger calls on her--particularly a stranger who may not know that she  is always confined to the house, it is correct for a daughter or sister  or even a friend to leave the invalid's card for her and even to pay a  visit should she find a hostess \"at home.\" In this event the visitor by  proxy lays her own card as well as that of the invalid on the tray  proffered her. Upon being announced to the hostess, she naturally explains  that she is appearing in place of her mother (or whatever relation the  invalid is to her) and that the invalid herself is unable to make any  visits.    A lady never pays a party call on a gentleman. But if the gentleman who  has given a dinner has his mother (or sister) staying with him and if the  mother (or sister) chaperoned the party, cards should of course be left  upon her.    Having risen to go, _go_! Don't stand and keep your hostess standing while  you say good-by, and make a last remark last half an hour!    Few Americans are so punctilious as to pay their dinner calls within  twenty-four hours; but it is the height of correctness and good manners.    When a gentleman, whose wife is away, accepts some one's hospitality, it  is correct for his wife to pay the party call with (or for) him, since it  is taken for granted that she would have been included had she been at  home.    In other days a hostess thought it necessary to change quickly into a best  dress if important company rang her door-bell. A lady of fashion to-day  receives her visitors at once in whatever dress she happens to be wearing,  since not to keep them waiting is the greater courtesy.          CHAPTER XI    INVITATIONS, ACCEPTANCES AND REGRETS      =THE FORMAL INVITATION=    As an inheritance from the days when Mrs. Brown presented her compliments  and begged that Mrs. Smith would do her the honor to take a dish of tea  with her, we still--notwithstanding the present flagrant disregard of  old-fashioned convention--send our formal invitations, acceptances and  regrets, in the prescribed punctiliousness of the third person.    All formal invitations, whether they are to be engraved or to be written  by hand (and their acceptances and regrets) are invariably in the third  person, and good usage permits of no deviation from this form.      =WEDDING INVITATIONS=    The invitation to the ceremony is engraved on the front sheet of white  note-paper. The smartest, at present, is that with a raised margin--or  plate mark. At the top of the sheet the crest (if the family of the bride  has the right to use one) is embossed without color. Otherwise the  invitation bears no device. The engraving may be in script, block, shaded  block, or old English. The invitation to the ceremony should always  request \"the honour\" of your \"presence,\" and never the \"pleasure\" of your  \"company.\" (Honour is spelled in the old-fashioned way, with a \"u\" instead  of \"honor.\")      _Enclosed in Two Envelopes_    Two envelopes are never used except for wedding invitations or  announcements; but wedding invitations and all accompaning cards are  always enclosed first in an inner envelope that has no mucilage on the  flap, and is superscribed \"Mr. and Mrs. Jameson Greatlake,\" without  address. This is enclosed in an outer envelope which is sealed and  addressed:        Mr. and Mrs. Jameson Greatlake,          24 Michigan Avenue,              Chicago.    To those who are only \"asked to the church\" no house invitation is  enclosed.      =THE CHURCH INVITATION=    The proper form for an invitation to a church ceremony is:    (_Form No. 1._)        Mr. and Mrs. John Huntington Smith      request the honour of your presence       at the marriage of their daughter               Mary Katherine                      to            Mr. James Smartlington        on Tuesday the first of November              at twelve o'clock            at St. John's Church           in the City of New York      (_Form No. 2._)          Mr. and Mrs. John Huntington Smith              request the honour of            [HW: Miss Pauline Town's]      presence at the marriage of their daughter                 Mary Katherine                       to            Mr. James Smartlington        on Tuesday the first of November               at twelve o'clock              at St. John's Church    (_The size of invitations is 5-1/8 wide by 7-3/8 deep._)      (_When the parents issue the invitations for a wedding at a house other  than their own._)             Mr. and Mrs. Richard Littlehouse                  request the honour of            presence at the marriage of their daughter                          Betty                           to                 Mr. Frederic Robinson           on Saturday the fifth of November                    at four o'clock        at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Sterlington                     Tuxedo Park                      New York        R.s.v.p.    No variation is permissible in the form of a wedding invitation. Whether  fifty guests are to be invited or five thousand, the paper, the engraving  and the wording, and the double envelope are precisely the same.      _Church Card of Admittance_    In cities or wherever the general public is not to be admitted, a card of  about the size of a small visiting card is enclosed with the church  invitation:          Please present this card,            at St. John's Church      on Tuesday the first of November      _Cards to Reserved Pews_    To the family and very intimate friends who are to be seated in especially  designated pews:        Please present this to an usher"]]]
