It should be premised, that  where the power of digestion in these patients is totally destroyed, there  is not much reason to expect a return to healthful vigour.    I have directed several of these patients to omit one fourth part of the  quantity of vinous spirit they have been lately accustomed to, and if in a  fortnight their appetite increases, they are advised to omit another fourth  part; but if they perceive that their digestion becomes impaired from the  want of this quantity of spirituous potation, they are advised to continue  as they are, and rather bear the ills they have, than risk the encounter of  greater. At the same time flesh-meat with or without spice is recommended,  with Peruvian bark and steel in small quantities between their meals, and  half a grain of opium or a grain, with five or eight grains of rhubarb at  night.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT.

The fibres of the vegetable world, as well as those of the animal,  are excitable into a variety of motion by irritations of external objects.  This appears particularly in the mimosa or sensitive plant, whose leaves  contract on the slightest injury; the dionaea muscipula, which was lately  brought over from the marshes of America, presents us with another curious  instance of vegetable irritability; its leaves are armed with spines on  their upper edge, and are spread on the ground around the stem; when an  insect creeps on any of them in its passage to the flower or seed, the leaf  shuts up like a steel rat-trap, and destroys its enemy. See Botanic Garden,  Part II. note on Silene.    The various secretions of vegetables, as of odour, fruit, gum, resin, wax,  honey, seem brought about in the same manner as in the glands of animals;  the tasteless moisture of the earth is converted by the hop-plant into a  bitter juice; as by the caterpillar in the nut-shell the sweet kernel is  converted into a bitter powder. While the power of absorption in the roots  and barks of vegetables is excited into action by the fluids applied to  their mouths like the lacteals and lymphatics of animals.    2. The individuals of the vegetable world may be considered as inferior or  less perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and in  this respect resembles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries of  a multitude of animals. Each of these buds of a tree has its proper leaves  or petals for lungs, produces its viviparous or its oviparous offspring in  buds or seeds; has its own roots, which extending down the stem of the tree  are interwoven with the roots of the other buds, and form the bark, which  is the only living part of the stem, is annually renewed, and is  superinduced upon the former bark, which then dies, and with its stagnated  juices gradually hardening into wood forms the concentric circles, which we  see in blocks of timber.    The following circumstances evince the individuality of the buds of trees.  First, there are many trees, whose whole internal wood is perished, and yet  the branches are vegete and healthy. Secondly, the fibres of the barks of  trees are chiefly longitudinal, resembling roots, as is beautifully seen in  those prepared barks, that were lately brought from Otaheita. Thirdly, in  horizontal wounds of the bark of trees, the fibres of the upper lip are  always elongated downwards like roots, but those of the lower lip do not  approach to meet them. Fourthly, if you wrap wet moss round any joint of a  vine, or cover it with moist earth, roots will shoot out from it. Fifthly,  by the inoculation or engrafting of trees many fruits are produced from one  stem. Sixthly, a new tree is produced from a branch plucked from an old  one, and set in the ground. Whence it appears that the buds of deciduous  trees are so many annual plants, that the bark is a contexture of the roots  of each individual bud; and that the internal wood is of no other use but  to support them in the air, and that thus they resemble the animal world in  their individuality.    The irritability of plants, like that of animals, appears liable to be  increased or decreased by habit; for those trees or shrubs, which are  brought from a colder climate to a warmer, put out their leaves and  blossoms a fortnight sooner than the indigenous ones.    Professor Kalm, in his Travels in New York, observes that the apple-trees  brought from England blossom a fortnight sooner than the native ones. In  our country the shrubs, that are brought a degree or two from the north,  are observed to flourish better than those, which come from the south. The  Siberian barley and cabbage are said to grow larger in this climate than  the similar more southern vegetables. And our hoards of roots, as of  potatoes and onions, germinate with less heat in spring, after they have  been accustomed to the winter's cold, than in autumn after the summer's  heat.    II. The stamens and pistils of flowers shew evident marks of sensibility,  not only from many of the stamens and some pistils approaching towards each  other at the season of impregnation, but from many of them closing their  petals and calyxes during the cold parts of the day. For this cannot be  ascribed to irritation, because cold means a defect of the stimulus of  heat; but as the want of accustomed stimuli produces pain, as in coldness,  hunger, and thirst of animals, these motions of vegetables in closing up  their flowers must be ascribed to the disgreeable sensation, and not to the  irritation of cold. Others close up their leaves during darkness, which,  like the former, cannot be owing to irritation, as the irritating material  is withdrawn.    The approach of the anthers in many flowers to the stigmas, and of the  pistils of some flowers to the anthers, must be ascribed to the passion of  love, and hence belongs to sensation, not to irritation.    III. That the vegetable world possesses some degree of voluntary powers,  appears from their necessity to sleep, which we have shewn in Sect. XVIII.  to consist in the temporary abolition of voluntary power. This voluntary  power seems to be exerted in the circular movement of the tendrils of  vines, and other climbing vegetables; or in the efforts to turn the upper  surface of their leaves, or their flowers to the light.    IV. The associations of fibrous motions are observable in the vegetable  world, as well as in the animal. The divisions of the leaves of the  sensitive plant have been accustomed to contract at the same time from the  absence of light; hence if by any other circumstance, as a slight stroke or  injury, one division is irritated into contraction, the neighbouring ones  contract also, from their motions being associated with those of the  irritated part. So the various stamina of the class of syngenesia have been  accustomed to contract together in the evening, and thence if you stimulate  one of them with a pin, according to the experiment of M. Colvolo, they all  contract from their acquired associations.    To evince that the collapsing of the sensitive plant is not owing to any  mechanical vibrations propagated along the whole branch, when a single leaf  is struck with the finger, a leaf of it was slit with sharp scissors, and  some seconds of time passed before the plant seemed sensible of the injury;  and then the whole branch collapsed as far as the principal stem: this  experiment was repeated several times with the least possible impulse to  the plant.    V. 1. For the numerous circumstances in which vegetable buds are analogous  to animals, the reader is referred to the additional notes at the end of  the Botanic Garden, Part I. It is there shewn, that the roots of vegetables  resemble the lacteal system of animals; the sap-vessels in the early  spring, before their leaves expand, are analogous to the placental vessels  of the foetus; that the leaves of land-plants resemble lungs, and those of  aquatic plants the gills of fish; that there are other systems of vessels  resembling the vena portarum of quadrupeds, or the aorta of fish; that the  digestive power of vegetables is similar to that of animals converting the  fluids, which they absorb, into sugar; that their seeds resemble the eggs  of animals, and their buds and bulbs their viviparous offspring. And,  lastly, that the anthers and stigmas are real animals, attached indeed to  their parent tree like polypi or coral insects, but capable of spontaneous  motion; that they are affected with the passion of love, and furnished with  powers of reproducing their species, and are fed with honey like the moths  and butterflies, which plunder their nectaries. See Botanic Garden, Part I.  add. note XXXIX.    The male flowers of vallisneria approach still nearer to apparent  animality, as they detach themselves from the parent plant, and float on  the surface of the water to the female ones.

It is needless to add that      goods delivered to customers must be of the same quality and      appearance as the samples, and that one must keep one's promises to      the dot. A little well-directed enterprise will land a customer, but      only good service can hold him.\"        When the current wholesale price of honey was $3 a case, Mrs.      Tupper's comb honey has been in demand at from 20 to 30 cents a      pound. She disposes of every pound to private customers and to one      grocery store which caters to \"fancy\" trade. She sells eggs from her      400 Anconas at from 4 to 6 cents more a dozen than the country      store is paying its patrons who bring in eggs and \"take them out in      trade.\"        Mrs. Tupper figured that if a trademark has advertising pull for a      manufacturing concern, it would help the farm business. She      christened her 10 acres \"Graceland Farm,\" and this name is stamped      on everything that leaves her place. She had cards printed bearing      the name of the farm, its telephone number, and its products.      Graceland Farm is also emphasized on letter heads.        \"Prompt attention to correspondence is an easy method of advertising      a farm business,\" she suggested. \"A typewritten letter on letterhead      stationery, mailed promptly, creates a pleasant impression on the      man who has written to inquire the price of a setting of eggs or a      trio of chickens.        \"Suppose I delayed a week and wrote the reply with pen and ink, or,      worse, with a pencil on ruled tablet paper. I'd stand a good chance      of losing a customer, wouldn't I? If I didn't miss an order      outright, I should certainly leave a suggestion of inefficiency and      carelessness which could only be charged to the debit side of the      business.\"        She has found that a $50 typewriter and a letter file have helped      greatly to create the good-will which is as essential to the farmer      business woman as to the woman who runs a millinery shop or an      insurance office.        Mrs. Tupper has encouraged automobile trade. Her apiary is within      sight of the road, and a \"Honey for Sale\" sign brings many a      customer. Many of her city patrons have the habit of driving to the      farm and returning with a hamper laden with eggs, honey, butter, or      canned stuff from the vegetable garden. The garden last summer      supplied material for more than 900 cans of vegetables.        The neighbors smile at her zeal for fairs and poultry shows.        \"It isn't fun altogether; it's business,\" she tells them.        It was cold, disagreeable work, for instance, to prepare an exhibit      for the Heart of America Poultry Show at Kansas City last fall; but      Mrs. Tupper felt repaid. She won first prize on hen, first and      second on pullet, and fourth on cockerel. Then she exhibited at the      St. Joseph, Missouri, Poultry Show with even better success.        \"These prizes will add to the value of every chicken I have, and to      all my poultry products. They give me another advertising point,\"      she said.        \"The shows gave me a fine opportunity to meet possible customers      and to make friends for my business. I was on the job for days. I      met scores of people and distributed hundreds of cards. I learned a      lot, too, in talks with judges and experienced breeders.\"        The Tupper bungalow is neat and attractive. In spite of her duties      in the poultry house and apiary, Mrs. Tupper serves appetizing      meals. She finds time for church work and neighborhood calls, and      gives every Thursday to the Red Cross.        The housework is speeded up with such conveniences as hot and cold      water in kitchen and bathroom, and steam heat. The kitchen is an      efficient little workshop lined by cupboards and shelves. Mrs.      Tupper can sit before her kitchen cabinet and prepare a meal without      moving about for ingredients and utensils. A service wagon saves      steps between kitchen and dining-room.        The floors of the bungalow are of hard wood. They are waxed a few      times each year, and a little work each morning with dust mop and      carpet sweeper keeps them in good order. The washing is sent out.        \"I couldn't earn an income from the farm if I had a farmhouse      without modern improvements,\" Mrs. Tupper declared. \"Reducing      drudgery to a minimum is only plain business sense. Laundry work,      scrubbing, and dishwashing have a low economic value. Such unskilled      labor eats up the time and strength one needs for the more      profitable and interesting tasks of farm management, accounting and      correspondence, advertising and marketing.\"    THE PERSONALITY SKETCH. We all like to read about prominent and  successful people. We want to know more about the men and women who  figure in the day's news, and even about interesting persons whose  success has not been great enough to be heralded in the press. What  appeals to us most about these individuals is, not mere biographical  facts such as appear in _Who's Who_, but the more intimate details of  character and personality that give us the key to their success. We want  to see them as living men and women. It is the writer's problem to  present them so vividly that we shall feel as if we had actually met  them face to face.    The purpose of the personality sketch may be (1) to give interesting  information concerning either prominent or little known persons, (2) to  furnish readers inspiration that may bear fruit in their own lives, (3)  to give practical guidance by showing how one individual has  accomplished a certain thing. Whether the aim is to afford food for  thought, inspiration to action, or guidance in practical matters, the  treatment is essentially the same.    The recognized methods of describing characters in fiction may be used  to advantage in portraying real persons. These are (1) using general  descriptive terms, (2) describing personal appearance, (3) telling of  characteristic actions, (4) quoting their words, (5) giving biographical  facts, (6) citing opinions of others about them, (7) showing how others  react to them. By a judicious combination of several of these methods, a  writer can make his readers visualize the person, hear him speak, watch  him in characteristic actions, and understand his past life, as well as  realize what others think of him and how they act toward him.    Material for a personality sketch may be obtained in one of three ways:  (1) from a more or less intimate acquaintance with the person to be  described; (2) from an interview with the person, supplemented by  conversation with others about him; (3) from printed sketches of him  combined with information secured from others. It is easier to write  personality sketches about men and women whom we know well than it is  about those whom we have never met, or with whom we have had only a  short interview. Inexperienced writers should not attempt to prepare  sketches of persons whom they know but slightly. In a single interview a  writer who is observant, and who is a keen judge of human nature, may be  able to get an impression sufficiently strong to serve as the basis of a  satisfactory article, especially if the material obtained in the  interview is supplemented by printed sketches and by conversations with  others. Personality sketches sometimes include long interviews giving  the person's opinions on the subject on which he is an authority. In  such articles the sketch usually precedes the interview.    EXAMPLES OF THE PERSONALITY SKETCH. The first of the following sketches  appeared, with a half-tone portrait, in the department of \"Interesting  People\" in the _American Magazine_; the second was sent out by the  Newspaper Enterprise Association, Cleveland, Ohio, which supplies  several hundred daily newspapers with special features.        (1)        \"TOMMY\"--WHO ENJOYS STRAIGHTENING OUT THINGS        BY SAMPSON RAPHAELSON        Six years ago a young Bulgarian immigrant, dreamy-eyed and shabby,      came to the University of Illinois seeking an education. He inquired      his way of a group of underclassmen and they pointed out to him a      large red building on the campus.        \"Go there,\" they said gayly, \"and ask for Tommy.\"        He did, and when he was admitted to the presence of Thomas Arkle      Clark, Dean of Men, and addressed him in his broken English as      \"Mis-terr Tommy,\" the dean did not smile. Although Mr. Clark had      just finished persuading an irascible father to allow his reprobate      sophomore son to stay at college, and although he was facing the      problem of advising an impetuous senior how to break an engagement      with a girl he no longer loved, he adapted himself to the needs and      the temperament of the foreigner instantly, sympathetically, and      efficiently.        In five minutes the Bulgarian had a job, knew what courses in      English he ought to take, and was filled with a glow of hope,      inspiration, and security which only a genius in the art of      graciousness and understanding like \"Tommy Arkle,\" as he is amiably      called by every student and alumnus of Illinois, can bestow.        This is a typical incident in the extremely busy, richly human daily      routine of the man who created the office of Dean of Men in American      universities. Slender, short, well-dressed, his gray hair smartly      parted, with kindly, clever, humorous blue eyes and a smile that is      an ecstasy of friendliness, \"Tommy\" sits behind his big desk in the      Administration Building from eight to five every day and handles all      of the very real troubles and problems of the four thousand-odd men      students at the University of Illinois.        He averages one hundred callers a day, in addition to answering a      heavy mail and attendance upon various committee, "]]]
