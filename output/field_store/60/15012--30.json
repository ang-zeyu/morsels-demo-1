Eclesiastia Indiana_, Lib. ii, cap. xiv.  \"Una tonta ficcion,\" comments the worthy chronicler upon the narrative,  \"como son las demas que creian cerca de sus dioses.\" This has been the  universal opinion. My ambition in writing this book is, that it will be  universal no longer.]    In many mythologies the gods of light and warmth are, by a natural  analogy, held to be also the deities which preside over plenty, fertility  and reproduction. This was quite markedly the case with Quetzalcoatl. His  land and city were the homes of abundance; his people, the Toltecs, \"were  skilled in all arts, all of which they had been taught by Quetzalcoatl  himself. They were, moreover, very rich; they lacked nothing; food was  never scarce and crops never failed. They had no need to save the small  ears of corn, so all the use they made of them was to burn them in heating  their baths.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. iii, cap. iii.]    As thus the promoter of fertility in the vegetable world, he was also the  genius of reproduction in the human race. The ceremonies of marriage which  were in use among the Aztecs were attributed to him,[1] and when the wife  found she was with child it was to him that she was told to address her  thanks. One of her relatives recited to her a formal exhortation, which  began as follows:--    [Footnote 1: Veitia, cap. xvii, in Kingsborough.]    \"My beloved little daughter, precious as sapphire and jade, tender and  generous! Our Lord, who dwells everywhere and rains his bounties on whom  he pleases, has remembered you. The God now wishes to give you the fruit  of marriage, and has placed within you a jewel, a rich feather. Perhaps  you have watched, and swept, and offered incense; for such good works the  kindness of the Lord has been made manifest, and it was decreed in Heaven  and Hell, before the beginning of the World, that this grace should be  accorded you. For these reasons our Lord, Quetzalcoatl, who is the author  and creator of things, has shown you this favor; thus has resolved He in  heaven, who is at once both man and woman, and is known under the names  Twice Master and Twice Mistress.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. vi, cap. xxv. The bisexual nature  of the Mexican gods, referred to in this passage, is well marked in many  features of their mythology. Quetzalcoatl is often addressed in the  prayers as \"father and mother,\" just as, in the Egyptian ritual, Chnum was  appealed to as \"father of fathers and mother of mothers\" (Tiele, _Hist. of  the Egyptian Religion_, p. 134). I have endeavored to explain this  widespread belief in hermaphroditic deities in my work entitled, _The  Religious Sentiment, Its Source and Aim_, pp. 65-68, (New York, 1876).]    It is recorded in the old histories that the priests dedicated to his  service wore a peculiar head-dress, imitating a snail shell, and for that  reason were called _Quateczizque_.[1] No one has explained this curiously  shaped bonnet. But it was undoubtedly because Quetzalcoatl was the god of  reproduction, for among the Aztecs the snail was a well known symbol of  the process of parturition.[2]    [Footnote 1: Duran, in Kingsborough, vol. viii, p. 267. The word is from  _quaitl_, head or top, and _tecziztli_, a snail shell.]    [Footnote 2: \"Mettevanli in testa una lumaca marina per dimostrare que  siccome il piscato esce dalle pieghe di quell'osso, o conca. cosi va ed  esce l'uomo _ab utero matris suae_.\" _Codice Vaticana, Tavola XXVI._]    Quetzalcoatl was that marvelous artist who fashions in the womb of the  mother the delicate limbs and tender organs of the unborn infant.  Therefore, when a couple of high rank were blessed with a child, an  official orator visited them, and the baby being placed naked before him,  he addressed it beginning with these words:--    \"My child and lord, precious gem, emerald, sapphire, beauteous feather,  product of a noble union, you have been formed far above us, in the ninth  heaven, where dwell the two highest divinities. His Divine Majesty has  fashioned you in a mould, as one fashions a ball of gold; you have been  chiseled as a precious stone, artistically dressed by your Father and  Mother, the great God and the great Goddess, assisted by their son,  Quetzalcoatl.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. vi, cap. xxxiv.]    As he was thus the god on whom depended the fertilization of the womb,  sterile women made their vows to him, and invoked his aid to be relieved  from the shame of barrenness.[1]    [Footnote 1: Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. xi, cap. xxiv.]    In still another direction is this function of his godship shown. The  worship of the genesiac principle is as often characterized by an  excessive austerity as by indulgence in sexual acts. Here we have an  example. Nearly all the accounts tell us that Quetzalcoatl was never  married, and that he held himself aloof from all women, in absolute  chastity. We are told that on one occasion his subjects urged upon him the  propriety of marriage, and to their importunities he returned the dark  answer that, Yes, he had determined to take a wife; but that it would be  when the oak tree shall cast chestnuts, when the sun shall rise in the  west, when one can cross the sea dry-shod, and when nightingales grow  beards.[1]    [Footnote 1: Duran, in Kingsborough, vol. viii, p. 267. I believe Alva  Ixtlilxochitl is the only author who specifically assigns a family to  Quetzalcoatl. This author does not mention a wife, but names two sons,  one, Xilotzin, who was killed in war, the other, Pochotl, who was educated  by his nurse, Toxcueye, and who, after the destruction of Tollan,  collected the scattered Toltecs and settled with them around the Lake of  Tezcuco (_Relaciones Historicas_, p. 394, in Kingsborough, vol. ix). All  this is in contradiction to the reports of earlier and better authorities.  For instance, Motolinia says pointedly, \"no fue casado, ni se le conocio  mujer\" (_Historia de los Indios, Epistola Proemial_).]    Following the example of their Master, many of the priests of his cult  refrained from sexual relations, and as a mortification of the flesh they  practiced a painful rite by transfixing the tongue and male member with  the sharp thorns of the maguey plant, an austerity which, according to  their traditions, he was the first to institute.[1] There were also in the  cities where his special worship was in vogue, houses of nuns, the inmates  of which had vowed perpetual virginity, and it was said that Quetzalcoatl  himself had founded these institutions.[2]    [Footnote 1: _Codex Vaticanus_, Tab. xxii.]    [Footnote 2: Veitia, _Historia_, cap. XVII.]    His connection with the worship of the reproductive principle seems to be  further indicated by his surname, _Ce acatl_. This means One Reed, and is  the name of a day in the calendar. But in the Nahuatl language, the word  _acatl_, reed, cornstalk, is also applied to the virile member; and it has  been suggested that this is the real signification of the word when  applied to the hero-god. The suggestion is plausible, but the word does  not seem to have been so construed by the early writers. If such an  understanding had been current, it could scarcely have escaped the  inquiries of such a close student and thorough master of the Nahuatl  tongue as Father Sahagun.    On the other hand, it must be said, in corroboration of this  identification, that the same idea appears to be conveyed by the symbol of  the serpent. One correct translation of the name Quetzalcoatl is \"the  beautiful serpent;\" his temple in the city of Mexico, according to  Torquemada, had a door in the form of a serpent's mouth; and in the _Codex  Vaticanus_, No. 3738, published by Lord Kingsborough, of which we have an  explanation by competent native authority, he is represented as a serpent;  while in the same Codex, in the astrological signs which were supposed to  control the different parts of the human body, the serpent is pictured as  the sign of the male member.[1] This indicates the probability that in his  function as god of reproduction Quetzalcoatl may have stood in some  relation to phallic rites.    [Footnote 1: Compare the _Codex Vaticanus_, No. 3738, plates 44 and 75,  Kingsborough, _Mexican Antiquities_, vol. ii.]    This same sign, _Ce Coatl_, One Serpent, used in their astrology, was that  of one of the gods of the merchants, and apparently for this reason, some  writers have identified the chief god of traffic, Yacatecutli (God of  Journeying), with Quetzalcoatl. This seems the more likely as another name  of this divinity was _Yacacoliuhqui_, With the End Curved, a name which  appears to refer to the curved rod or stick which was both his sign and  one of those of Quetzalcoatl.[1] The merchants also constantly associated  in their prayers this deity with Huitzilopochtli, which is another reason  for supposing their patron was one of the four primeval brothers, and but  another manifestation of Quetzalcoatl. His character, as patron of arts,  the model of orators, and the cultivator of peaceful intercourse among  men, would naturally lend itself to this position.    [Footnote 1: Compare Torquemada, _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. vi, cap. xxviii  and Sahagun, _Historia de Nueva Espana_, Lib. ix, _passim_.    _Yacatecutli_, is from _tecutli_, lord, and either _yaqui_, traveler, or  else _yacana_, to conduct.    _Yacacoliuhqui_, is translated by Torquemada, \"el que tiene la nariz  aquilena.\" It is from _yaque_, a point or end, and hence, also, the nose,  and _coliuhqui_, bent or curved. The translation in the text is quite as  allowable as that of Torquemada, and more appropriate. I have already  mentioned that this divinity was suspected, by Dr. Schultz-Sellack, to be  merely another form of Quetzalcoatl. See above, chapter iii, Sec.2]    But Quetzalcoatl, as god of the violent wind-storms, which destroy the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#20)"],[1,"the  temperature very perceptibly cooler.    Up to the present time we had seen no signs of sea-tangle or  molluscae, but during the night we beheld some molluscae for the  first time, shining like stars at a great depth below the surface of  the water.    In these latitudes the constellation of the southern cross keeps  increasing in brilliancy and beauty, though it is far from being as  wonderful as it is said to be.  The stars in it, four in number, and  disposed somewhat in the following manner, **** are, it is true,  large and splendid; but they did not excite, either in myself or any  other person of our company, much more admiration than the other  constellations.    As a general rule, many travellers exaggerate a great deal.  On the  one hand, they often describe things which they have never seen  themselves, and only know from hearsay; and, on the other, they  adorn what they really have seen with a little too much imagination.    16th January.  In 37 degrees South lat. we fell in with a strong  current, running from south to north, and having a yellow streak  down the middle of it.  The captain said that this streak was caused  by a shoal of small fishes.  I had some water drawn up in a bucket,  and really found a few dozen living creatures, which, in my opinion,  however, belonged rather to some species of molluscae than to any  kind of fish.  They were about three-quarters of an inch long, and  as transparent as the most delicate water-bubbles; they were marked  with white and light yellow spots on the forepart of their bodies,  and had a few feelers underneath.    In the night of the 20th to 21st of January we were overtaken by a  very violent storm, which so damaged our mainmast that the captain  determined on running into some haven on the first opportunity, and  putting in a new one.  For the present the old one was made fast  with cables, iron chains, and braces.    In 43 degrees North lat. we saw the first sea-tangle.  The  temperature had by this time very perceptibly decreased in warmth,  the glass often standing no higher than 59 or 63 degrees Fah.    23rd January.  We were so near Patagonia that we could distinctly  make out the outline of the coast.    26th January.  We still kept near the land.  In 50 degrees South  lat. we saw the chalky mountains of Patagonia.  Today we passed the  Falkland Islands, which stretched from 51 to 52 degrees South lat.  We did not see them, however, as we kept as near the land as  possible, in order not to miss the Straits of Magellan.  For some  days the captain had been studying an English book, which, in his  opinion, clearly proved that the passage through the Straits of  Magellan was far less dangerous and far shorter than that round Cape  Horn.  I asked him how it happened that other sailors knew nothing  of this valuable book, and why all vessels bound for the western  coast of America went round Cape Horn?  He could give me no other  answer than that the book was very dear, and that that was the  reason no one bought it. {60}    To me this bold idea of the captain's was extremely welcome.  I  already pictured in my mind the six-feet tall Patagonians putting  off to us in their boats; I saw myself taking their mussels, plants,  ornaments, and weapons in exchange for coloured ribbons and  handkerchiefs; while, to render my satisfaction complete, the  captain said that he should land at Port Famine (a Patagonian haven)  to supply the injured portion of our mainmast.  How thankful was I,  in secret, to the storm for having reduced our ship to her present  condition.    Too soon, however, were all my flattering hopes and dreams  dispelled.  On the 27th of January the latitude and longitude were  taken, and it was then found that the Straits of Magellan were  twenty-seven minutes (or nautical miles) behind us, but as we were  becalmed, the captain promised, in case a favourable wind should  spring up, to endeavour to return as far as the Straits.    I placed no more confidence in this promise, and I was right.  About  noon a scarcely perceptible breeze sprang up, which the captain, in  high spirits, pronounced a favourable one--for rounding Cape Horn.  If he had ever really intended to pass through the Straits, he would  only have had to cruise about for a few hours, for the wind soon  changed and blew directly in the desired direction.    28th January.  We were constantly so near Terra del Fuego that we  could make out every bush with the naked eye.  We could have reached  the land in an hour, without retarding our voyage in the least, for  we were frequently becalmed; but the captain would not consent, as  the wind might spring up every instant.    The coast appeared rather steep, but not high; the foreground was  composed of meagre pasture alternating with tracts of sand, and in  the background were ranges of woody hills, beyond which rose snow-  covered mountains.  On the whole, the country struck me as being  much more inhabitable than the Island of Iceland, which I had  visited a year and a half previously.  The temperature, too, must  here be higher, as even at sea we had 54 degrees 5' and 59 degrees  Fah.    I saw three kinds of sea-tangle, but could only obtain a specimen of  one, resembling that which I had seen in 44 degrees South lat.  The  second kind was not very different, and it was only the third that  had pointed leaves, several of which together formed a sort of fan  several feet long and broad.    On the 30th of January we passed very near the Staten Islands, lying  between 56 and 57 degrees South lat.  They are composed of bare high  mountains, and separated from Terra del Fuego by an arm of the sea,  called Le Maire, only seven miles long and about the same distance  across.    The captain told us, seaman-like, that on one occasion of his  sailing through these Straits, his ship had got into a strong  current, and regularly danced, turning round during the passage at  least a thousand times!  I had already lost a great deal of  confidence in the captain's tales, but I kept my eye steadily fixed  upon a Hamburgh brig, that happened to be sailing ahead, to see  whether she would dance; but neither she nor our own bark was so  obliging.  Neither vessels turned even once, and the only  circumstance worthy of remark was the heaving and foaming of the  waves in the Strait, while at both ends the sea lay majestically  calm before our eyes.  We had passed the Strait in an hour, and I  took the liberty of asking the captain why our ship had not danced,  to which he replied that it was because we had had both wind and  current with us.  It is, perhaps, possible that under other  circumstances the vessel might have turned round once or twice, but  I strongly doubt its doing so a thousand times.  This was, however,  a favourite number with our worthy captain.  One of the gentlemen  once asked him some question about the first London hotels, and was  told that it was impossible to remember their names, as there were  above a thousand of the first class.    Near the Strait Le Maire begins, in the opinion of seamen, the  dangerous part of the passage round Cape Horn, and ends off the  Straits of Magellan.  Immediately we entered it we were greeted with  two most violent bursts of wind, each of which lasted about half an  hour; they came from the neighbouring icy chasms in the mountains of  Terra del Fuego, and split two sails, and broke the great studding  sail-yard, although the sailors were numerous and quick.  The  distance from the end of the Strait Le Maire to the extreme point of  the Cape is calculated to be not more than seventy miles, and yet  this trifling passage cost us three days.    At last, on the 3rd of February, we were fortunate enough to reach  the southernmost point of America, so dreaded by all mariners.  Bare, pointed mountains, one of which looks like a crater that has  fallen in, form the extremity of the mighty mountain-chain, and a  magnificent group of colossal black rocks (basalt?), of all shapes  and sizes, are scattered at some distance in advance, and are  separated only by a small arm of the sea.  The extreme point of Cape  Horn is 600 feet high.  At this spot, according to our works on  geography, the Atlantic Ocean changes its name and assumes that of  the Pacific.  Sailors, however, do not give it the latter  designation before reaching the Straits of Magellan, as up to this  point the sea is continually stormy and agitated, as we learned to  our cost, being driven by violent storms as far back as 60 degrees  South lat.  Besides this, we lost our top-mast, which was broken  off, and which, in spite of the heavy sea, had to be replaced; the  vessel, meanwhile, being so tossed about, that we were often unable  to take our meals at the table, but were obliged to squat down upon  the ground, and hold our plates in our hands.  On one of these fine  days the steward stumbled with the coffee-pot, and deluged me with  its burning contents.  Luckily, only a small portion fell upon my  hands, so that the accident was not a very serious one.    After battling for fourteen days with winds and waves, with rain and  cold, {62} we at last arrived off the western entrance to the  Straits of Magellan, having accomplished the most dangerous portion  of our voyage.  During these fourteen days we saw very few whales or  albatrosses, and not one iceberg.    We thought that we should now quietly pursue our way upon the placid  sea, trusting confidently in its peaceful name.  For three whole  days we had nothing to complain of; but in the night of the 19th to  the 20th of February, we were overtaken by a storm worthy of the  Atlantic itself, which lasted for nearly twenty-four hours, and cost  us four sails.  We suffered most damage from the tremendous waves,  which broke with such fury over the ship, that they tore up one of  the planks of the deck, and let the water into the cargo of sugar.  The deck itself was like a lake, and "]]]
