Satisfied she certainly  was not; and yet there was so much mystery between them, so many  instinctive reservations upon either side, that very little circumstance  of the kind could not carry an ulterior significance, but many must be  due to mere force of habit.    Rachel hated the condition of mutual secretiveness upon which she had  married this man; it was antagonistic to her whole nature; she longed to  repudiate it, and to abolish all secrets between them. But there her  pride stepped in and closed her lips; and the intolerable thought that  she would value her husband's confidence more than he would value hers,  that she felt drawn to him despite every sinister attribute, would bring  humiliation and self-loathing in its train. It was the truth, however,  or, at all events, part of the truth.    Yet a more unfair arrangement Rachel had been unable to conceive, ever  since the fatally reckless moment in which she had acquiesced in this  one. The worst that could be known about her was known to her husband  before her marriage; she had nothing else to hide; all concealment of  the past, as between themselves, was upon his side. But matters were  coming to a crisis in this respect; and, when Rachel deemed it done  with, this incident of the tramp was only just begun.    It seemed that the servants knew of it, and that it was not Steel who  had originally discovered the sleeping intruder, but an under-gardener,  who, seeing his master also up and about, had prudently inquired what  was to be done with the man before meddling with him.    \"And the master said, 'leave him to me,'\" declared Rachel's maid, who  was her informant on the point, as she combed out her mistress's  beautiful brown hair, before the late breakfast which did away with  luncheon when there were no visitors at Normanthorpe.    \"And did he do so?\" inquired Rachel, looking with interest into her own  eyes in the glass. \"Did he leave him to your master?\"    \"He did that!\" replied her maid, a simple Yorkshire wench, whom Rachel  herself had chosen in preference to the smart town type. \"Catch any on  'em not doin what master tells them!\"    \"Then did John see what happened?\"    \"No, m'm--because master sent him to see if the chap'd come in at t'  lodge gates, or where, and when he got back he was gone, blanket an'  all, an' master with him.\"    \"Blanket and all!\" repeated Rachel. \"Do you mean to say he had the  impudence to bring a blanket with him?\"    \"And slept in it!\" cried her excited little maid. \"John says he found  him tucked up in a corner of the lawn, out of the wind, behind some o'  them shrubs, sound asleep, and lapped round and round in his blue  banket from head to heel.\"    Rachel saw her own face change in the glass; but she only asked one more  question, and that with a smile.    \"Did John say it was a blue blanket, Harris, or did your own imagination  supply the color?\"    \"He said it, m'm; faded blue.\"    \"And pray when did you see John to hear all this?\" demanded Rachel,  suddenly remembering her responsibility as mistress of this young  daughter of the soil.    \"Deary me, m'm,\" responded the ingenuous Harris, \"I didn't see him, not  more than any of the others; he just comed to t' window of t' servants'  hall, as we were having our breakfasts, and he told us all at once. He  was that full of it, was John!\"    Rachel asked no more questions; but she was not altogether sorry that  the matter had already become one of common gossip throughout the house.  Meanwhile she made no allusion to it at breakfast, but her observation  had been quickened by the events of the morning, and thus it was that  she noticed and recognized the narrow blue book which was too long for  her husband's breast-pocket, and would show itself as he stooped over  his coffee. It was his check-book, and Rachel had not seen it since  their travels.    That afternoon a not infrequent visitor arrived on his bicycle, to which  was tied a bouquet of glorious roses instead of a lamp; this was Charles  Langholm, the novelist, who had come to live in Delverton, over two  hundred miles from his life-long haunts and the literary market-place,  chiefly because upon a happy-go-lucky tour through the district he had  chanced upon what he never tired of calling \"the ideal rose-covered  cottage of my dreams,\" though also for other reasons unknown in  Yorkshire. His flat was abandoned before quarter-day, his effects  transplanted at considerable cost, and ever since Langholm had been a  bigoted countryman, who could not spend a couple of days in town without  making himself offensive on the subject at his club, where he was  nevertheless discreetly vague as to the exact locality of his rural  paradise. Even at the club, however, it was admitted that his work had  improved almost as much as his appearance; and he put it all down to the  roses in which he lived embowered for so many months of the year. Such  was their profusion that you could have filled a clothes-basket without  missing one, and Langholm never visited rich or poor without a little  offering out of his abundance.    \"They may be coals to Newcastle,\" he would say to the Woodgates or the  Steels, \"but none of your Tyneside collieries are a patch on mine.\"    Like most victims of the artistic temperament, the literary Langholm was  a creature of moods; but the very fact of a voluntary visit from him was  sufficient guarantee of the humor in which he came, and this afternoon  he was at his best. He had indeed been writing all day, and for many  days past, and was filled with the curious exhilaration which  accompanies an output too rapid and too continuous to permit a running  sense of the defects. He was a ship with a fair wind, which he valued  the more for the belts of calms and the adverse weather through which he  had passed and must inevitably pass again; for the moment he was a happy  man, though one with no illusion as to the present product of his  teeming pen.    \"It is nonsense,\" he said to Rachel, in answer to a question from that  new and sympathetic friend, \"but it is not such nonsense as to seem  nothing else when one's in the act of perpetrating it, and what more can  one want? It had to be done by the tenth of August, and by Jove it will  be! A few weeks ago I didn't think it possible; but the summer has  thawed my ink.\"    \"Are you sure it isn't Mrs. Steel?\" asked one of the Venables girls,  who had also ridden over on their bicycles. \"I heard you had a  tremendously literary conversation when you dined with us.\"    \"We had, indeed!\" said Langholm, with enthusiasm. \"And Mrs. Steel gave  me one of the best ideas I ever had in my life; that's another reason  why I'm racing through this rubbish--to take it in hand.\"    It was Sybil to whom he was speaking, but at this point Rachel plunged  into the conversation with the sister, Vera, which required an effort,  since the elder Miss Venables was a young lady who had cultivated  languor as a sign of breeding and sophistication. Rachel, however, made  the effort with such a will that the talk became general in a moment.    \"I don't know how anybody writes books,\" was the elder young lady's  solitary contribution; her tone added that she did not want to know.    \"Nor I,\" echoed Sybil, \"especially in a place like this, where nothing  ever happens. If I wanted to write a novel, I should go to Spain--or  Siberia--or the Rocky Mountains--where things do happen, according to  all accounts.\"    \"Young lady,\" returned the novelist, a twinkle in his eye, \"I had  exactly the same notion when I first began, and I remember what a much  older hand said to me when I told him I was going down to Cornwall for  romantic background. 'Young man,' said he, 'have you placed a romance in  your mother's backyard yet?' I had not, but I did so at once instead of  going to Cornwall, and sounder advice I never had in my life. Material,  like charity, begins at home; nor need you suppose that nothing ever  happens down here. That is the universal idea of the native about his or  her own heath, but I can assure you it isn't the case at all. Only just  now, on my way here, I saw a scene and a character that might have been  lifted bodily out of Bret Harte.\"    Sybil Venables clamored for particulars, while her sister resigned  herself to further weariness of the flesh. Rachel put down her cup and  leant forward with curiously expectant eyes. They were sitting in the  cool, square hall, with doors shut or open upon every hand, and the  gilded gallery overhead. Statuettes and ferns, all reflected in the  highly polished marble floor, added a theatrical touch which was not out  of keeping with a somewhat ornate interior.    \"It was the character,\" continued Langholm, \"who was making the scene;  and a stranger creature I have never seen on English earth. He wore what  I believe they call a Crimean shirt, and a hat like a stage cowboy; and  he informed all passers that he was knocking down his check!\"    \"What?\" cried Rachel and Sybil in one breath, but in curiously different  tones.    \"Knocking down his check,\" repeated Langholm. \"It's what they do in the  far west or the bush or somewhere--but I rather fancy it's the  bush--when they get arrears of wages in a lump in one check.\"    \"And where did you see all this?\" inquired Rachel, whose voice was very  quiet, but her hazel eyes alight with a deeper interest than the story  warranted.    \"At the Packhorse on the York Road. I came that way round for the sake  of the surface and the exercise.\"    \"And did you see the check?\"    \"No, I only stopped for a moment, to find out what the excitement was  about; but the fellow I can see now. You never set eyes on such a  pirate--gloriously drunk and bearded to the belt. I didn't stop, because  he was lacing into everybody with a cushion, and the local loafers  seemed to like it.\"    \"What a joke!\" cried Sybil Venables.    \"There "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#20)"],[1,"laid him senseless on the ground.    When Isaac regained his senses he felt a throbbing pain in his head,  and then he opened his eyes he was so dizzy that he was unable to  discern objects clearly. After a few moments his sight returned.  When he had struggled to a sitting posture he discovered that his  hands were bound with buckskin thongs. By his side he saw two long  poles of basswood, with some strips of green bark and pieces of  grapevine laced across and tied fast to the poles. Evidently this  had served as a litter on which he had been carried. From his wet  clothes and the position of the sun, now low in the west, he  concluded he had been brought across the river and was now miles  from the fort. In front of him he saw three Indians sitting before a  fire. One of them was cutting thin slices from a haunch of deer  meat, another was drinking from a gourd, and the third was roasting  a piece of venison which he held on a sharpened stick. Isaac knew at  once the Indians were Wyandots, and he saw they were in full war  paint. They were not young braves, but middle aged warriors. One of  them Isaac recognized as Crow, a chief of one of the Wyandot tribes,  and a warrior renowned for his daring and for his ability to make  his way in a straight line through the wilderness. Crow was a short,  heavy Indian and his frame denoted great strength. He had a broad  forehead, high cheek bones, prominent nose and his face would have  been handsome and intelligent but for the scar which ran across his  cheek, giving him a sinister look.    \"Hugh!\" said Crow, as he looked up and saw Isaac staring at him. The  other Indians immediately gave vent to a like exclamation.    \"Crow, you caught me again,\" said Isaac, in the Wyandot tongue,  which he spoke fluently.    \"The white chief is sure of eye and swift of foot, but he cannot  escape the Huron. Crow has been five times on his trail since the  moon was bright. The white chief's eyes were shut and his ears were  deaf,\" answered the Indian loftily.    \"How long have you been near the fort?\"    \"Two moons have the warriors of Myeerah hunted the pale face.\"    \"Have you any more Indians with you?\"    The chief nodded and said a party of nine Wyandots had been in the  vicinity of Wheeling for a month. He named some of the warriors.    Isaac was surprised to learn of the renowned chiefs who had been  sent to recapture him. Not to mention Crow, the Delaware chiefs  Son-of-Wingenund and Wapatomeka were among the most cunning and  sagacious Indians of the west. Isaac reflected that his year's  absence from Myeerah had not caused her to forget him.    Crow untied Isaac's hands and gave him water and venison. Then he  picked up his rifle and with a word to the Indians he stepped into  the underbrush that skirted the little dale, and was lost to view.    Isaac's head ached and throbbed so that after he had satisfied his  thirst and hunger he was glad to close his eyes and lean back  against the tree. Engrossed in thoughts of the home he might never  see again, he had lain there an hour without moving, when he was  aroused from his meditations by low guttural exclamations from the  Indians. Opening his eyes he saw Crow and another Indian enter the  glade, leading and half supporting a third savage.    They helped this Indian to the log, where he sat down slowly and  wearily, holding one hand over his breast. He was a magnificent  specimen of Indian manhood, almost a giant in stature, with broad  shoulders in proportion to his height. His head-dress and the gold  rings which encircled his bare muscular arms indicated that he was a  chief high in power. The seven eagle plumes in his scalp-lock  represented seven warriors that he had killed in battle. Little  sticks of wood plaited in his coal black hair and painted different  colors showed to an Indian eye how many times this chief had been  wounded by bullet, knife, or tomahawk.    His face was calm. If he suffered he allowed no sign of it to escape  him. He gazed thoughtfully into the fire, slowly the while untying  the belt which contained his knife and tomahawk. The weapons were  raised and held before him, one in each hand, and then waved on  high. The action was repeated three times. Then slowly and  reluctantly the Indian lowered them as if he knew their work on  earth was done.    It was growing dark and the bright blaze from the camp fire lighted  up the glade, thus enabling Isaac to see the drooping figure on the  log, and in the background Crow, holding a whispered consultation  with the other Indians. Isaac heard enough of the colloquy to guess  the facts. The chief had been desperately rounded; the palefaces  were on their trail, and a march must be commenced at once.    Isaac knew the wounded chief. He was the Delaware Son-of-Wingenund.  He married a Wyandot squaw, had spent much of his time in the  Wyandot village and on warring expeditions which the two friendly  nations made on other tribes. Isaac had hunted with him, slept under  the same blanket with him, and had grown to like him.    As Isaac moved slightly in his position the chief saw him. He  straightened up, threw back the hunting shirt and pointed to a small  hole in his broad breast. A slender stream of blood issued from the  wound and flowed down his chest.    \"Wind-of-Death is a great white chief. His gun is always loaded,\" he  said calmly, and a look of pride gleamed across his dark face, as  though he gloried in the wound made by such a warrior.    \"Deathwind\" was one of the many names given to Wetzel by the  savages, and a thrill of hope shot through Isaac's heart when he saw  the Indians feared Wetzel was on their track. This hope was short  lived, however, for when he considered the probabilities of the  thing he knew that pursuit would only result in his death before the  settlers could come up with the Indians, and he concluded that  Wetzel, familiar with every trick of the redmen, would be the first  to think of the hopelessness of rescuing him and so would not  attempt it.    The four Indians now returned to the fire and stood beside the  chief. It was evident to them that his end was imminent. He sang in  a low, not unmusical tone the death-chant of the Hurons. His  companions silently bowed their heads. When he had finished singing  he slowly rose to his great height, showing a commanding figure.  Slowly his features lost their stern pride, his face softened, and  his dark eyes, gazing straight into the gloom of the forest, bespoke  a superhuman vision.    \"Wingenund has been a great chief. He has crossed his last trail.  The deeds of Wingenund will be told in the wigwams of the Lenape,\"  said the chief in a loud voice, and then sank back into the arms of  his comrades. They laid him gently down.    A convulsive shudder shook the stricken warrior's frame. Then,  starting up he straightened out his long arm and clutched wildly at  the air with his sinewy fingers as if to grasp and hold the life  that was escaping him.    Isaac could see the fixed, sombre light in the eyes, and the pallor  of death stealing over the face of the chief. He turned his eyes  away from the sad spectacle, and when he looked again the majestic  figure lay still.    The moon sailed out from behind a cloud and shed its mellow light  down on the little glade. It showed the four Indians digging a grave  beneath the oak tree. No word was spoken. They worked with their  tomahawks on the soft duff and soon their task was completed. A bed  of moss and ferns lined the last resting place of the chief. His  weapons were placed beside him, to go with him to the Happy Hunting  Ground, the eternal home of the redmen, where the redmen believe the  sun will always shine, and where they will be free from their cruel  white foes.    When the grave had been filled and the log rolled on it the Indians  stood by it a moment, each speaking a few words in a low tone, while  the night wind moaned the dead chief's requiem through the tree  tops.    Accustomed as Isaac was to the bloody conflicts common to the  Indians, and to the tragedy that surrounded the life of a borderman,  the ghastly sight had unnerved him. The last glimpse of that stern,  dark face, of that powerful form, as the moon brightened up the spot  in seeming pity, he felt he could never forget. His thoughts were  interrupted by the harsh voice of Crow bidding him get up. He was  told that the slightest inclination on his part to lag behind on the  march before them, or in any way to make their trail plainer, would  be the signal for his death. With that Crow cut the thongs which  bound Isaac's legs and placing him between two of the Indians, led  the way into the forest.    Moving like spectres in the moonlight they marched on and on for  hours. Crow was well named. He led them up the stony ridges where  their footsteps left no mark, and where even a dog could not find  their trail; down into the valleys and into the shallow streams  where the running water would soon wash away all trace of their  tracks; then out on the open plain, where the soft, springy grass  retained little impress of their moccasins.    Single file they marched in the leader's tracks as he led them  onward through the dark forests, out under the shining moon, never  slacking his rapid pace, ever in a straight line, and yet avoiding  the roughest going with that unerring instinct which was this  Indian's gift. Toward dawn the moon went down, leaving them in  darkness, but this made no difference, for, guided by the stars,  Crow kept straight on his course. Not till break of day did he come  to a halt.    Then, on the banks of a narrow stream, the Indians kindled a fire  and broiled some of the venison. Crow told Isaac he could rest, so  he made haste to avail himself of the permission, and almost  instantly was wrapped in the deep slumber of exhaustion. Three of  the Indians followed suit, and Crow stood guard. Sleepless,  tireless, he paced to and "]]]
