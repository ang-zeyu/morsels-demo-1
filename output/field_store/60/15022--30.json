This can only be accounted for, in my judgment,  by supposing that they have been the receptacles of ore brought from a  foreign source; and we can at least conjecture where and how gathered.  We can imagine, and we are forced to conclude, that there has been a  zone of solution below, where steam and hot water, under great pressure,  have effected the leaching of ore-bearing strata, and a zone of  deposition above, where cavities in pre-existent solidified and  shattered rocks became the repositories of the deposits made from  ascending solutions, when the temperature and pressure were diminished.  Where great masses of fused material were poured out, these must have  been for along time too highly heated to become places of deposition; so  long indeed that the period of active vein formation may have passed  before they reached a degree of solidification and coolness that would  permit their becoming receptacles of the products of deposition. On the  contrary, the masses of unfused and always relatively cool sedimentary  rocks which form the most highly metalliferous mountain ranges (White  Pine, Toyabe, etc.) were, throughout the whole period of disturbance, in  a condition to become such repositories. Certainly highly heated  solutions forced by an irresistible _vis a tergo_ through rocks of any  kind down in the heated zone, would be far more effective leaching  agents than cold surface water with feeble solvent power, moved only by  gravity, percolating slowly through superficial strata.    Richthofen, who first made a study of the Comstock lode, suggests that  the mineral impregnation of the vein was the result of a process like  that described, viz., the leaching of deep-seated rocks, perhaps the  same that inclose the vein above, by highly heated solutions which  deposited their load near the surface. On the other hand, Becker  supposes the concentration to have been effected by surface waters  flowing laterally through the igneous rocks, gathering the precious  metals and depositing them in the fissure, as lateral secretion produces  the accumulation of ore in the limestone of the lead region. But there  are apparently good reasons for preferring the theory of Richthofen:  viz., first, the veinstone of the Comstock is chiefly quartz, the  natural and common precipitate of _hot_ waters, since they are far more  powerful solvents of silica than cold. On the contrary, the ores  deposited from lateral secretion, as in the Mississippi lead region, at  low temperature contain comparatively little silica; second, the great  mineral belt to which reference has been made above is now the region  where nearly all the hot springs of the continent are situated. It is,  in fact, a region conspicuous for the number of its hot springs, and it  is evident that these are the last of the series of thermal phenomena  connected with the great volcanic upheavals and eruptions, of which this  region has been the theater since the beginning of the Tertiary age. The  geysers of Yellowstone Park, the hot springs of the Wamchuck district in  Oregon, the Steamboat Springs of Nevada, the geysers of California, the  hot springs of Salt Lake City, Monroe, etc., in Utah, and the Pagosa in  Colorado, are only the most conspicuous among thousands of hot springs  which continue in action at the present time. The evidence is also  conclusive that the number of hot springs, great as it now is in this  region, was once much greater. That these hot springs were capable of  producing mineral veins by material brought up in and deposited from  their waters, is demonstrated by the phenomena observable at the  Steamboat Springs, and which were cited in my former article as  affording the best illustration of vein formation.    The temperature of the lower workings of the Comstock vein is now over  150 deg.F., and an enormous quantity of hot water is discharged through the  Sutro Tunnel. This water has been heated by coming in contact with hot  rocks at a lower level than the present workings of the Comstock lode,  and has been driven upward in the same way that the flow of all hot  springs is produced. As that flow is continuous, it is evident that the  workings of the Comstock have simply opened the conduits of hot springs,  which are doing to-day what they have been doing in ages past, but much  less actively, i.e., bringing toward the surface the materials they have  taken into solution in a more highly heated zone below. Hence it seems  much more natural to suppose that the great sheets of ore-bearing quartz  now contained in the Comstock fissure were deposited by ascending  currents of hot alkaline waters, than by descending currents of those  which were cold and neutral The hot springs are there, though less  copious and less hot than formerly, and the natural deposits from hot  waters are there. Is it not more rational to suppose with Richthofen  that these are related as cause and effect, rather than that cold water  has leached the ore and the silica from the walls near the surface? Mr.  Becker's preference for the latter hypothesis seems to be due to the  discovery of gold and silver in the igneous rocks adjacent to the vein,  and yet, except in immediate contact with it, these rocks contain no  more of the precious metals than the mere trace which by refined tests  may be discovered everywhere. If, as we have supposed, the fissure was  for a long time filled with a hot solution charged with an unusual  quantity of the precious metals, nothing would be more natural than that  the wall rocks should be to some extent impregnated with them.    It will perhaps illuminate the question to inquire which of the springs  and water currents of this region are now making deposits that can be  compared with those which filled the Comstock and other veins. No one  who has visited that country will hesitate to say the hot and not the  cold waters. The immense silicious deposits, carrying the ores of  several metals, formed by the geysers of the Yellowstone, the Steamboat  Springs, etc., show what the hot waters are capable of doing; but we  shall search in vain for any evidence that the cold surface waters have  done or can do this kind of work.    At Leadville the case is not so plain, and yet no facts can be cited  which really _prove_ that the ore deposits have been formed by the  leaching of the overlying porphyry rather than by an outflow of heated  mineral solutions along the plane of junction between the porphyry and  the limestone. Near this plane the porphyry is often thoroughly  decomposed, is somewhat impregnated with ore, and even contains sheets  of ore within itself; but remote from the plane of contact with the  limestone, it contains little diffused and no concentrated ore. It is  scarcely more previous than the underlying limestones, and why a  solution that could penetrate and leach ores from it should be stopped  at the upper surface of the blue limestone is not obvious; nor why the  plane of junction between the porphyry and the _blue limestone_ should  be the special place of deposit of the ore.    If the assays of the porphyry reported by Mr. Emmons were accurately  made, and they shall be confirmed by the more numerous ones necessary to  settle the question, and the estimates he makes of the richness of that  rock be corroborated, an unexpected result will be reached, and, as I  think, a remarkable and exceptional case of the diffusion of silver and  lead through an igneous rock be established.    It is of course possible that the Leadville porphyries are only phases  of rocks rich in silver, lead, and iron, which underlie this region, and  which have been fused and forced to the surface by an ascending mass of  deeper seated igneous rock; but even if the argentiferous character of  the porphyry shall be proved, it will not be proved that such portions  of it as here lie upon the limestone have furnished the ore by the  descending percolation of cold surface waters. Deeper lying masses of  this same silver, lead, and iron bearing rock, digested in and leached  by _hot_ waters and steam under great pressure, would seem to be a more  likely source of the ore. If the surface porphyry is as rich in silver  as Mr. Emmous reports it to be, it is too rich, for the rock that has  furnished so large a quantity of ores as that which formed the ore  bodies which I saw in the Little Chief and Highland Chief mines,  respectively 90 feet and 162 feet thick, should be poor in silver and  iron and lead, and should be rotten from the leaching it had suffered,  but except near the ore-bearing contact it is compact and normal.    Such a digested, kaolinized, desilicated rock as we would naturally look  for we find in the porphyry _near the contact_; and its condition there,  so different from what it is remote from the contact, seems to indicate  an exposure to local and decomposing influences, such indeed as a hot  chemical solution forced up from below along the plane of contact would  furnish.    It is difficult to understand why the upper portions of the porphyry  sheet should be so different in character, so solid and homogeneous,  with no local concentrations or pockets of ore, if they have been  exposed to the same agencies as those which have so changed the under  surface.    Accepting all the facts reported by Mr. Emmons, and without questioning  the accuracy of any of his observations, or depreciating in any degree  the great value of the admirable study he has made of this difficult and  interesting field, his conclusion in regard to the source of the ore  cannot yet be insisted on as a logical necessity. In the judgment of the  writer, the phenomena presented by the Leadville ore deposits can be as  well or better accounted for by supposing that the plane of contact  between the limestone and porphyry has been the conduit through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#20)"],[1,"of German posters. By day I  observed the location of these placards, announcing certain death  to those who \"sniped on German troops,\" \"harbored courier-  pigeons,\" or \"destroyed\" these self-same posters.    At night with trembling hands I laid cold compresses on them until  the adhering paste gave way; then, tucking the wet sheets  beneath my coat, I stole back to safety. At last in England I feasted  my eyes on the precious documents, dreaming of the time when  posterity should rejoice in the possession of these posters relating  to the German overlordship of Belgium, and give thanks to the  courage of their collector. Unfortunately, their stained and torn  appearance grated on the aesthetic sensibilities of the maid.    \"Where are they?\" I demanded on my return to my room one time,  as I missed them.    \"Those nasty papers?\" she inquired naively.    \"Those priceless souvenirs,\" I returned severely. She did not  comprehend, but with a most aggravatingly sweet expression said:    \"They were so dirty, sir, I burned them all up.\"    She couldn't understand why I rewarded her with something akin  to a fit of apoplexy, instead of a liberal tip. That day was a red-letter  one for our photographers. They paid the price in the risks which  constantly strained their nerves. But in it they garnered vastly more  than in the fortnight they had hugged safety.    But, despite all our efforts, there was one object that we were after  that we never did attain. That was a first-class atrocity picture.  There were atrocity stories in endless variety, but not one that the  camera could authenticate. People were growing chary of verbal  assurances of these horrors; they yearned for some photographic  proof, and we yearned to furnish it.    \"What features are you looking for?\" was the question invariably  put to us on discovering our cameras.    \"Children with their hands cut off,\" we replied. \"Are there any  around here?\"    \"Oh, yes! Hundreds of them,\" was the invariable assurance.    \"Yes, but all we want is one--just one in flesh and bone. Where  can we find that?\"    The answer was ever the same. \"In the hospital at the rear, or at  the front.\" \"Back in such-and-such a village,\" etc. Always  somewhere else; never where we were.    Let no one attempt to gloss the cruelties perpetrated in Belgium.  My individual wish is to see them pictured as crimson as possible,  that men may the fiercer revolt against the shame and horror of  this red butchery called war. But this is a record of just one  observer's reactions and experiences in the war zone. After weeks  in this contested ground, the word \"atrocity\" now calls up to my  mind hardly anything I saw in Belgium, but always the savageries I  have witnessed at home in America.    For example, the organized frightfulness that I once witnessed in  Boston. Around the strikers picketing a factory were the police in  full force and a gang of thugs. Suddenly at the signal of a shrill  whistle, sticks were drawn from under coats and, right and left,  men were felled to the cobblestones. After a running fight a score  were stretched out unconscious, upon the square. As blood  poured out of the gashes, like tigers intoxicated by the sight and  smell thereof, the assailants became frenzied, kicking and beating  their victims, already insensible. In a trice the beasts within had  been unleashed.    If in normal times men can lay aside every semblance of restraint  and decency and turn into raging fiends, how much greater cause  is there for such a transformation to be wrought under the stress of  war when, by government decree, the sixth commandment is  suspended and killing has become glorified. At any rate my  experiences in America make credible the tales told in Belgium.    But there are no pictures of these outrages such as the Germans  secured after the Russian drive into their country early in the war.  Here are windrows of mutilated Germans with gouged eyes and  mangled limbs, attesting to that same senseless bestial ferocity  which lies beneath the veneer.    All the photographers were fired with desire to make a similar  picture in Belgium, yet though we raced here and there, and  everywhere that rumor led us, we found it but a futile chase.    Through the Great Hall in Ghent there poured 100,000 refugees.  Here we pleaded how absolutely imperative it was that we should  obtain an atrocity picture. The daughter of the burgomaster, who  was in charge, understood our plight and promised to do her best.  But out of the vast concourse she was able to uncover but one  case that could possibly do service as an atrocity.    It was that of a blind peasant woman with her six children. The  photographers told her to smile, but she didn't, nor did the older  children; they had suffered too horribly to make smiling easy.  When the Germans entered the village the mother was in bed with  her day-old baby. Her husband was seized and, with the other  men, marched away, as the practice was at that period of the  invasion, for some unaccountable reason. With the roof blazing  over her head, she was compelled to arise from her bed and drag  herself for miles before she found a refuge. I related this to a  German later and he said: \"Oh, well, there are plenty of peasant  women in the Fatherland who are hard at work in the fields three  days after the birth of their child.\"    The Hall filled with women wailing for children, furnished  heartrending sights, but no victim bore such physical marks as the  most vivid imagination could construe into an atrocity.    \"I can't explain why we don't get a picture,\" said the free lance.  \"Enough deviltry has been done. I can't see why some of the stuff  doesn't come through to us.\"    \"Simply because the Germans are not fools,\" replied the movie-  man; \"when they mutilate a victim, they go through with it to the  finish. They take care not to let telltales go straggling out to damn  them.\"    Some one proposed that the only way to get a first-class atrocity  picture was to fake it. It was a big temptation, and a fine field for  the exercise of their inventive genius. But on this issue the chorus  of dissent was most emphatic.    The nearest that I came to an atrocity was when in a car with Van  Hee, the American vice-consul at Ghent. Van Hee was a man of  laconic speech and direct action. I told him what Lethbridge, the  British consul, had told me; viz., that the citizens of Ghent must  forthwith erect a statue of Van Hee in gold to commemorate his  priceless services. \"The gold idea appeals to me, all right,\" said  Van Hee, \"but why put it in a statue!\" He routed me out at five one  morning to tell me that I could go through the German lines with  Mr. Fletcher into Brussels. We left the Belgian Army cheering the  Stars and Stripes, and came to the outpost of sharpshooters.  Crouching behind a barricade, they were looking down the road.  They didn't know whether the Germans were half a mile, two miles,  or five miles down that road.    Into that uncertain No-Man's-Land we drove with only our honking  to disturb the silence, while our minds kept growing specters of  Uhlans the size of Goliath. Fletcher and I kept up a hectic  conversation upon the flora and fauna of the country. But Van  Hee, being of strong nerves, always gleefully brought the talk back  to Uhlans.    \"How can you tell an Uhlan?\" I faltered.    \"If you see a big gray man on horseback, with a long lance,  spearing children,\" said Van Hee, \"why, that's an Uhlan.\"    Turning a sharp corner, we ran straight ahead into a Belgian  bicycle division--scouting in this uncertain zone. In a flash they  were off their wheels, rifles at their shoulders and fingers on  triggers.    Two boys, gasping with fear, thrust their guns up into our very  faces. In our gray coats we had been taken for a party of German  officers. They were positive that a peasant was hanging in a barn  not far away. But we insisted that our nerves had had enough for  the day. Even Van Hee was willing to let the conversation drift  back to flowers and birds. We drove along in chastened spirit until  hailed by the German outpost, about five miles from where we had  left the Belgians. No-Man's-Land was wide in those days.    But what is it that really constitutes an atrocity? In a refugee shed,  sleeping on the straw, we found an old woman of 88. All that was  left to her was her shawl, her dress, and the faint hope of seeing  two sons for whom she wept. Extreme old age is pitiful in itself.  With homelessness it is tragic. But such homeless old age as this,  with scarce one flickering ray of hope, is double-distilled tragedy. If  some marauder had bayoneted her, and she had died therefrom, it  would have been a kindly release from all the anguish that the  future now held in store for her. Of course that merciful act would  have constituted an atrocity, because it would have been a breach  in the rules of the war game.    But in focusing our attention upon the violations of the code, we  are apt to forget the greater atrocity of the violation of Belgium, and  the whole hideous atrocity of the great war. That is getting things  out of proportion, for the sufferings entailed by these technical  atrocities are infinitesimal alongside of those resulting from the war  itself.    Another point has been quite overlooked. In recounting the  atrocities wrought by Prussian Imperialism, no mention is made of  those that it has committed upon its own people. And yet at any  rate a few Germans suffered in the claws of the German eagle  quite as cruelly as any Belgians did. One fine morning in  September three Germans came careening into Ghent in a great  motor car. They were dazed to find no evidence of their army  which they supposed was in possession. Before the men became  aware of their mistake, a Belgian mitrailleuse poured a stream of  lead into their midst, killing two of them outright. The third German,  with a ball in his neck, "]]]
