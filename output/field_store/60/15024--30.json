This place also  is infinitely rich in tin-mines.    I am now at my journey's end.  As to the islands of Scilly, which lie  beyond the Land's End, I shall say something of them presently.  I must  now return _sur mes pas_, as the French call it; though not literally so,  for I shall not come back the same way I went.  But as I have coasted the  south shore to the Land's End, I shall come back by the north coast, and  my observations in my return will furnish very well materials for another  letter.        APPENDIX TO LAND'S END.      I have ended this account at the utmost extent of the island of Great  Britain west, without visiting those excrescences of the island, as I  think I may call them--viz., the rocks of Scilly; of which what is most  famous is their infamy or reproach; namely, how many good ships are  almost continually dashed in pieces there, and how many brave lives lost,  in spite of the mariners' best skill, or the lighthouses' and other sea-  marks' best notice.    These islands lie so in the middle between the two vast openings of the  north and south narrow seas (or, as the sailors call them, the Bristol  Channel, and The Channel--so called by way of eminence) that it cannot,  or perhaps never will, be avoided but that several ships in the dark of  the night and in stress of weather, may, by being out in their  reckonings, or other unavoidable accidents, mistake; and if they do, they  are sure, as the sailors call it, to run \"bump ashore\" upon Scilly, where  they find no quarter among the breakers, but are beat to pieces without  any possibility of escape.    One can hardly mention the Bishop and his Clerks, as they are called, or  the rocks of Scilly, without letting fall a tear to the memory of Sir  Cloudesley Shovel and all the gallant spirits that were with him, at one  blow and without a moment's warning dashed into a state of  immortality--the admiral, with three men-of-war, and all their men  (running upon these rocks right afore the wind, and in a dark night)  being lost there, and not a man saved.  But all our annals and histories  are full of this, so I need say no more.    They tell us of eleven sail of merchant-ships homeward bound, and richly  laden from the southward, who had the like fate in the same place a great  many years ago; and that some of them coming from Spain, and having a  great quantity of bullion or pieces of eight on board, the money  frequently drives on shore still, and that in good quantities, especially  after stormy weather.    This may be the reason why, as we observed during our short stay here,  several mornings after it had blown something hard in the night, the  sands were covered with country people running to and fro to see if the  sea had cast up anything of value.  This the seamen call \"going  a-shoring;\" and it seems they do often find good purchase.  Sometimes  also dead bodies are cast up here, the consequence of shipwrecks among  those fatal rocks and islands; as also broken pieces of ships, casks,  chests, and almost everything that will float or roll on shore by the  surges of the sea.    Nor is it seldom that the voracious country people scuffle and fight  about the right to what they find, and that in a desperate manner; so  that this part of Cornwall may truly be said to be inhabited by a fierce  and ravenous people.  For they are so greedy, and eager for the prey,  that they are charged with strange, bloody, and cruel dealings, even  sometimes with one another; but especially with poor distressed seamen  when they come on shore by force of a tempest, and seek help for their  lives, and where they find the rooks themselves not more merciless than  the people who range about them for their prey.    Here, also, as a farther testimony of the immense riches which have been  lost at several times upon this coast, we found several engineers and  projectors--some with one sort of diving engine, and some with another;  some claiming such a wreck, and some such-and-such others; where they  alleged they were assured there were great quantities of money; and  strange unprecedented ways were used by them to come at it: some, I say,  with one kind of engine, and some another; and though we thought several  of them very strange impracticable methods, yet I was assured by the  country people that they had done wonders with them under water, and that  some of them had taken up things of great weight and in a great depth of  water.  Others had split open the wrecks they had found in a manner one  would have thought not possible to be done so far under water, and had  taken out things from the very holds of the ships.  But we could not  learn that they had come at any pieces of eight, which was the thing they  seemed most to aim at and depend upon; at least, they had not found any  great quantity, as they said they expected.    However, we left them as busy as we found them, and far from being  discouraged; and if half the golden mountains, or silver mountains  either, which they promise themselves should appear, they will be very  well paid for their labour.    From the tops of the hills on this extremity of the land you may see out  into that they call the Chops of the Channel, which, as it is the  greatest inlet of commerce, and the most frequented by merchant-ships of  any place in the world, so one seldom looks out to seaward but something  new presents--that is to say, of ships passing or repassing, either on  the great or lesser Channel.    Upon a former accidental journey into this part of the country, during  the war with France, it was with a mixture of pleasure and horror that we  saw from the hills at the Lizard, which is the southern-most point of  this land, an obstinate fight between three French men-of-war and two  English, with a privateer and three merchant-ships in their company.  The  English had the misfortune, not only to be fewer ships of war in number,  but of less force; so that while the two biggest French ships engaged the  English, the third in the meantime took the two merchant-ships and went  off with them.  As to the picaroon or privateer, she was able to do  little in the matter, not daring to come so near the men-of-war as to  take a broadside, which her thin sides would not have been able to bear,  but would have sent her to the bottom at once; so that the English men-of-  war had no assistance from her, nor could she prevent the taking the two  merchant-ships.  Yet we observed that the English captains managed their  fight so well, and their seamen behaved so briskly, that in about three  hours both the Frenchmen stood off, and, being sufficiently banged, let  us see that they had no more stomach to fight; after which the  English--having damage enough, too, no doubt--stood away to the eastward,  as we supposed, to refit.    This point of the Lizard, which runs out to the southward, and the other  promontory mentioned above, make the two angles--or horns, as they are  called--from whence it is supposed this county received its first name of  Cornwall, or, as Mr. Camden says, _Cornubia_ in the Latin, and in the  British \"Kernaw,\" as running out in two vastly extended horns.  And  indeed it seems as if Nature had formed this situation for the direction  of mariners, as foreknowing of what importance it should be, and how in  future ages these seas should be thus thronged with merchant-ships, the  protection of whose wealth, and the safety of the people navigating them,  was so much her early care that she stretched out the land so very many  ways, and extended the points and promontories so far and in so many  different places into the sea, that the land might be more easily  discovered at a due distance, which way soever the ships should come.    Nor is the Lizard Point less useful (though not so far west) than the  other, which is more properly called the Land's End; but if we may credit  our mariners, it is more frequently first discovered from the sea.  For  as our mariners, knowing by the soundings when they are in the mouth of  the Channel, do then most naturally stand to the southward, to avoid  mistaking the Channel, and to shun the Severn Sea or Bristol Channel, but  still more to avoid running upon Scilly and the rocks about it, as is  observed before--I say, as they carefully keep to the southward till they  think they are fair with the Channel, and then stand to the northward  again, or north-east, to make the land, this is the reason why the Lizard  is, generally speaking, the first land they make, and not the Land's End.    Then having made the Lizard, they either (first) run in for Falmouth,  which is the next port, if they are taken short with easterly winds, or  are in want of provisions and refreshment, or have anything out of order,  so that they care not to keep the sea; or (secondly) stand away for the  Ram Head and Plymouth Sound; or (thirdly) keep an offing to run up the  Channel.    So that the Lizard is the general guide, and of more use in these cases  than the other point, and is therefore the land which the ships choose to  make first; for then also they are sure that they are past Scilly and all  the dangers of that part of the island.    Nature has fortified this part of the island of Britain in a strange  manner, and so, as is worth a traveller's observation, as if she knew the  force and violence of the mighty ocean which beats upon it; and which,  indeed, if the land was not made firm in proportion, could not withstand,  but would have been washed away long ago.    First, there are the islands of Scilly and the rocks about them; these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#20)"],[1,"of the star.    2. _Catalogue of Spectra of Faint Stars_.--This work resembles the  preceding, but is much more extensive. The same instrument is used, but  each region has an exposure of an hour, the rate of the clock being such  that the width of the spectrum will be as before 0.1 cm. Many stars of  the ninth magnitude will thus be included, and nearly all brighter than  the eighth. In one case, over three hundred spectra are shown on a  single plate. This work has been carried on only in the intervals when  the telescope was not needed for other purposes. 99 plates have,  however, been obtained, and on these 4,442 spectra have been measured.  It is proposed to complete the equatorial zones first, gradually  extending the work northward. In all, 15,729 spectra of bright and faint  stars have been measured.    3. _Detailed Study of the Spectra of the Brighter Stars_.--This work has  been carried on with the 11 inch photographic telescope used by Dr.  Draper in his later researches. A wooden observatory was constructed  about 20 feet square. This was surmounted by a dome having a clear  diameter of 18 feet on the inside. The dome had a wooden frame, sheathed  and covered with canvas. It rested on eight cast iron wheels, and was  easily moved by hand, the power being directly applied. Work was begun  upon it in June, and the first observations were made with the telescope  in October.    Two prisms were formed by splitting a thick plate of glass diagonally.  These gave such good results that two others were made in the same way,  and the entire battery of four prisms is ordinarily used. The safety and  convenience of handling the prisms is greatly increased by placing them  in square brass boxes, each of which slides into place like a drawer.  Any combination of the prisms may thus be employed. As is usual in such  an investigation, a great variety of difficulties have been encountered,  and the most important of them have now been overcome.    4. _Faint Stellar Spectra_.--The 28 inch reflector will be used for the  study of the spectra of the faint stars, and also for the fainter  portions near the ends of the spectra of the brighter stars. The form of  spectroscope mentioned above, in which the collimator and slit are  replaced by a concave lens, will be tried. The objects to be examined  are, first, the stars known to be variable, with the expectation that  some evidence may be afforded of the cause of the variation. The stars  whose spectrum is known to be banded, to contain bright lines, or to be  peculiar in other respects, will also be examined systematically.  Experiments will also be tried with orthochromatic plates and the use of  a colored absorbing medium, in order to photograph the red portions of  the spectra of the bright stars. Quartz will also be tried to extend the  images toward the ultra-violet.    5. _Absorption Spectra_.--The ordinary form of comparison spectrum  cannot be employed on account of the absence of a slit. The most  promising method of determining the wave lengths of the stellar spectra  is to interpose some absorbent medium. Experiments are in progress with  hyponitric fumes and other substances. A tank containing one of these  materials is interposed and the spectra photographed through it. The  stellar spectra will then be traversed by lines resulting from the  absorption of the media thus interposed, and, after their wave lengths  are once determined, they serve as a precise standard to which the  stellar lines may be referred. The absorption lines of the terrestrial  atmosphere would form the best standard for this purpose if those which  are sufficiently fine can be photographed.    6. _Wave Lengths_.--The determination of the wave lengths of the lines  in the stellar spectra will form an important part of the work which has  not yet been begun. The approximate wave lengths can readily be found  from a comparison with the solar spectrum, a sufficient number of solar  lines being present in most stellar spectra. If, then, satisfactory  results are obtained in the preceding investigation, the motion of the  stars can probably be determined with a high degree of precision. The  identification of the lines with those of terrestrial substances will of  course form a part of the work, but the details will be considered  subsequently.    From the above statement it will be seen that photographic apparatus has  been furnished on a scale unequaled elsewhere. But what is more  important, Mrs. Draper has not only provided the means for keeping these  instruments actively employed, several of them during the whole of every  clear night, but also of reducing the results by a considerable force of  computers, and of publishing them in a suitable form. A field of work of  great extent and promise is open, and there seems to be an opportunity  to erect to the name of Dr. Henry Draper a memorial such as heretofore  no astronomer has received. One cannot but hope that such an example may  be imitated in other departments of astronomy, and that hereafter other  names may be commemorated, not by a needless duplication of unsupported  observatories, but by the more lasting monuments of useful work  accomplished.

The dark bay colt Merry Hampton had never run in public before winning  the Derby on the 25th of May last. This colt, by Hampton out of Doll  Tear-sheet, was one of Mr. Crowther Harrison's draught of yearlings sent  up to the Doncaster sales in 1885, and fell to the bid of Mr. T. Spence,  acting for Mr. Abingdon, for 3,100 guineas. The Oaks, on May 27, was won  by a daughter of the same sire. Merry Hampton is to compete for the  Grand Prize of Paris and for the St. Leger. He has also liabilities in  the Thirty-ninth Triennial and Grand Duke Michael stakes at Newmarket,  First October; Newmarket Derby at the Second October; Ascot Derby and  Twenty-fifth New Biennial; Drawing-room stakes at Goodwood; Great  International Breeders' Foal stakes at Kempton Park, August; North Derby  at Newcastle, Summer; St. George stakes at Liverpool, July; Bickerstaffe  stakes and St. Leger at Liverpool, August; Midland Derby stakes at  Leicester, July; and Ebor St. Leger at York, August; in addition to the  following races in 1888: Champion stakes at Newmarket, Second October;  Rous Memorial and Hardwicke stakes at Ascot, and Eclipse stakes at  Sandown Park, Second Summer. Merry Hampton's name also appears in the  Kempton Park Royal stakes of 10,000 sovereigns at the Spring Meeting of  1889.--_Ill. London News_.    [Illustration: MERRY HAMPTON.

At the extreme south of the presidency of Bombay, separating the  district of Kanara from the territory of Mysore, are the too little  known Falls of Gairsoppa.    Far higher than Niagara, four distinct divisions of the river Shiravatti  (traditionally created by a cleft made by the arrow of the great god  Rama) fall over a precipice of gneiss rock into an abyss eight hundred  feet below. Each of these cataracts differs in type of flow.    The \"Rajah,\" eight hundred and thirty feet, and at a breadth of  fifty-six, shoots silent and sheer over an uplifted lip of rock in the  bed of the stream, casting a dark shadow behind him when faced by the  sun; the \"Roarer\" makes noise enough in its headlong rush to vibrate the  strong, stone-built travelers' bungalow on the heights above; the  \"Rocket\" is straight in descent, and, as a commentator has already  remarked, as much like a rocket as anything else; and \"La Dame Blanche,\"  a triptych of rhythmical flow, spreads a dainty, silky, sheen of white,  whispering, glistening, softly falling water over a slightly shelving  width of rock, touched here and there with prismatic color and strong  light.    [Illustration: THE FALLS OF GAIRSOPPA, BETWEEN KANARA AND MYSORE, BOMBAY  PRESIDENCY, INDIA    The Falls From Below. The Falls From Above.]    At the bottom of the chasm, seven hundred feet across, and stretching  over a muddy, turbulent, seething cauldron of spray, a brilliantly  distinct rainbow in the full light of day may be seen with its scarcely  less glorious reflection, dazzlingly beautiful.    In these regions 210 inches of rain is an average downpour for the  monsoon between May and October, the heaviest fall being generally in  July. The cataracts then become frequently confluent, though not more  picturesque. They are then too difficult of access, and the whole  district is very malarious. December and January are the best months for  travelers, before the dry season fairly sets in again, during which  there is but little water, even insufficient to form four distinct  falls.    The best route to them is from Bombay to Honaurre by sea, _via_ Kawai,  and on to Old Gairsoppa by river boat and palanquin to the \"Jog,\" as the  special points of interest (the \"Falls\") are called by the Kanarese.    To the enthusiastic shikari, however, the way from Hubli (on the  Southern Mahratta Railway, easily reached by G.I.P. line from Bombay),  taking him, as it does, through the very happiest hunting grounds of the  presidency, where all game, small and large, abounds, will have  attraction enough; and at Giddapur, the last stage, within twelve miles  of the Falls, there is a courteous English-speaking native magistrate,  willing and able to help the traveler on his way.
