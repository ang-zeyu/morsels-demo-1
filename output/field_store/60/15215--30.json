The  Russian Jews, during the reign of Nicholas I, found themselves in a  position possible only in Russia. They were not allowed to emigrate, nor  suffered to stay. In 1823 they were expelled from the farms, and had to  crowd into the cities; in 1838 they were expelled from the cities, and  forced to go back to the country. Then Siberia was opened to them, but  when it was found that even the land of the outcasts was hailed as a  place of refuge by the Jews, they were told to go to Kherson. At last  arrangements were perfected to allow them to colonize Lithuania--all at  once even this was interdicted. They had been conquered with the Poles,  yet were left unprotected against the Poles. Could they help suspecting  the tyrant of what he really intended to do--of seeking to diminish  their numbers by conversion? Is it surprising that when he determined to  open public schools and establish rabbinical seminaries, Jews looked  upon these, too, as the sugared poison with which he intended to  extirpate Judaism? Or can we blame them for being determined to the last  to baffle him? Nicholas did not understand the great lesson taught by  the history of the Jews and inculcated in the old song,      To destroy all these people    You should let them alone.    All that tyranny could inflict, the Russian Jews endured. Yet their  number was not diminished. No coercion could make them leave, in a body,  the old paths they were wont to tread. Nicholas's so-called reforms only  encouraged a reaction, and the more he afflicted the Jews, the more they  multiplied and grew. The behalot of 1754, 1764, and 1793 were repeated  in 1833 and 1843; the missionary propaganda only strengthened the  devotion of the faithful; and the denial of the means of support only  increased the stolidity of the sufferers. And if, like some  stepchildren, they were first beaten till they cried, and then beaten  because they cried, like some stepchildren they rapidly forgot their lot  in the happiness of home and the studies of the bet ha-midrash, and  could sing[48] without bitterness even of the behalah-days, when      Little boys and little girls    Together had been mated,    Tishah be-Ab, the wedding day,--    Not a soul invited.    Only the father and the mother,    And also uncle Elye--    In his lengthy delye (caftan),    With his scanty beard--    Jump and jig with each other    Like a colt afeared.    (Notes, pp. 314-317.)          CHAPTER IV    CONFLICTS AND CONQUESTS    1840-1855      The charges brought against the Jews of Russia by henchmen of the czar  were grave, indeed, only they did not contain a particle of truth. In  Russia itself, not only Jews and non-Russians but even many Christians  testified to the innocence of the Jews, and protested against their  oppressors. Bibikov, the Governor-General of Podolia and Volhynia;  Diakov, the Governor-General of Smolensk; and Surovyetsky, the noted  statesman, all write in terms of such praise of their unfortunate  countrymen of the Jewish faith that their statements would sound  exaggerated, were it not that many other unprejudiced Russians confirm  their views.[1] The fact that Nicholas thought the Jews reliable as  soldiers speaks against the imputation that they were mercenary and  unpatriotic. Neither was the conventional accusation, that they were a  people of petty traders, applicable to the Jews in Russia. Laborers of  all kinds were very common among them. It was they, in fact, who  rendered all manner of service to their Gentile neighbors, from a  cobbler's and blacksmith's to producing the most exquisite _objets  d'art_ and gold and silver engraving. They were equally well represented  among the clerks and bookkeepers, and the bricklayers and stone-cutters.  They took up with the most laborious employments, if only they furnished  them with an honest even though scanty livelihood.[2]    But most unfounded of all was the allegation that Jews were opposed to  education. The _Memoirs_ of Madame Pauline Wengeroff indicate that even  among the very strict Jews of her time children were not denied  instruction in the German, Polish, and Russian literatures. We have seen  how they availed themselves of the permission, granted to them by  Alexander I, to attend the schools and universities of the empire. Nor  did they fail to open schools of their own. No sooner was the  Franco-Russian war over than Joseph Perl of Galicia founded a school in  Tarnopol (1813), then under the Russian Government, and two years later  he drew upon his own resources to build a school-house large enough to  accommodate the great, steadily growing number of students. In 1822 we  hear of a school that had been in existence for some time in Uman (the  Ukraine). It had been established by Meir Horn, Moses Landau, and Hirsh  Hurwitz, all of whom were indefatigable laborers in the cause of  Haskalah in the Ukraine. Perl's school was the pattern and model for a  multitude of other schools, among them the one founded by Zittenfeld  (1826) in Odessa, in the faculty of which were Simhah Pinsker, Elijah  Finkel, the grandson of Elijah Gaon, and Abraham Abele, the eminent  Talmudist. In 1836 a girls' department was added to it, and when  Lilienthal visited Odessa (ab. 1843) it had an attendance of from four  to five hundred pupils of both sexes, the annual expense being  twenty-eight thousand rubles. A similar school was opened in Kishinev by  Stern, and in the early \"forties\" there was hardly a Jewish community of  note without one or more of such Jewish public institutions. Several  well-to-do Maskilim not only founded but, like Perl, also maintained  such schools, and gave instruction in some or all of the subjects taught  in them.[3]    The \"forties\" began auspiciously for Haskalah in Russia. On January 15,  1840, the Riga community, amid pomp and rejoicing, opened the first  Jewish school affiliated with a university. The teaching staff consisted  of three Jews and one Christian, with Doctor Max Lilienthal (1815-1882),  the young, highly recommended, and recently chosen local rabbi, as its  principal. In the same year, the indefatigable Basilius Stern succeeded  in forming a committee, of which Hayyim Efrusi and Moses Lichtenstadt  were members, to deliberate on founding rabbinical seminaries in Russia.  In 1841, forty-five delegates, representing the six chief committees of  the Lovers of Enlightenment, assembled in Vilna, and thence issued an  appeal in which they adopted as their platform the elevation of the  moral standards of adults by urging them to follow useful trades and  discouraging the Jewish proclivity to business as much as possible; a  reform of the prevailing system of the education of the young; the  combating, if possible the eradication, of Hasidism, the fountainhead,  as they thought, of ignorance and superstition; the establishment of  rabbinical seminaries, after the model of those in Padua and Amsterdam,  to supply congregations with educated rabbis. It was further agreed that  a Consistory be created, to supervise Jewish affairs and establish  schools and technical institutes wherever necessary. To these main  points were added several others of minor importance. The Maskilim of  Besascz insisted that steps be taken to stop the prevailing custom of  premature marriages. Those of Brest proposed that Government aid be  invoked to compel Jews to dress in the German style, to use authorized  text-books in the hadarim, and interdict the study of the Talmud except  by those preparing themselves for the rabbinate.[4]    Even in Vilna and Minsk, towns which later put themselves on record as  opposed to Government schools, the Jews yielded gladly to the  innovations of such Maskilim as S. Perl, G. Klaczke, I. Bompi, and the  distinguished philanthropist David Luria, who took the initiative in  transforming the educational system of these cities. Under the  superintendence of Luria, the Minsk Talmud Torah became a model  institution; the training conferred there on the poor and orphaned  surpassed that given to the children of the rich in their private  schools. This aroused jealousy in the parents of the latter, and at  their request Luria organized a merchants' school, for the wealthier  class. He then established what he called Midrash Ezrahim, or Citizens'  Institute, in which he met with such success that he attracted the  attention of the authorities, and received a special acknowledgment from  the czar.[5]    Russian Jewry was astir with new life. In many places secular education  was divorced for the first time from rabbinical speculation. Knowledge  became an end in itself, and learning increased greatly. An  investigation by Nicholas I convinced all who were interested that  though the Talmud remained the chief subject of study, the number of  educated Jews was far greater than commonly supposed. The upliftment of  the masses was the beau-ideal of every Maskil, and Hebrew and even the  much-despised Yiddish were employed to effect it. Ignorance was regarded  as the bane of life, and enlightenment as the panacea for all the ills  to which their downtrodden brethren were heirs. As their pious  coreligionists deemed it the universal duty to be well-versed in the  Talmud, so the Maskilim thought it incumbent upon everybody to be highly  cultured. No obstacle was great enough to discourage them. They were  willing martyrs to the goddess of Wisdom, at whose shrine they  worshipped, and whose cult they spread in the most adverse  circumstances.    Had the Government not interfered with the efforts of the Maskilim, or  had it chosen a commission from among the Russian Jews themselves, among  whom, as soon became evident to Nicholas himself, there were more than  enough to do justice to an educational inquiry, the Haskalah movement  would have continued to spread, notwithstanding the obstacles put in its  way. But Nicholas was determined to reduce the number of Jews also by  \"re-edu"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#20)"],[1,"artisan  also was to pay tithe, with the exception of those who were employed in  the foundry attached to the temple, and whose occupation consisted in  making the images of the gods. The king further ordered that a copy of  this decree, the original of which was cut in wood, should be engraved  on a stele to be set up in the sanctuary, with figures of Khnemu and his  companion gods cut above it. The man who spat upon the stele [if  discovered] was to be \"admonished with a rope.\"                        THE LEGEND OF THE WANDERINGS OF ISIS    The god Osiris, as we have seen in the chapter on the Egyptian Religion  in the accompanying volume, lived and reigned at one time upon earth in  the form of a man. His twin-brother Set was jealous of his popularity,  and hated him to such a degree that he contrived a plan whereby he  succeeded in putting Osiris to death. Set then tried to usurp his  brother's kingdom and to make himself sole lord of Egypt, and, although  no text states it distinctly, it is clear that he seized his brother's  wife, Isis, and shut her up in his house. Isis was, however, under the  protection of the god Thoth, and she escaped with her unborn child, and  the following Legend describes the incidents that befell her, and the  death and revivification of Horus. It is cut in hieroglyphs upon a large  stone stele which was made for Ankh-Psemthek, a prophet of Nebun in the  reign of Nectanebus I, who reigned from 373 B.C. to 360 B.C. The stele  was dug up in 1828 at Alexandria, and was given to Prince Metternich by  Muhammad Ali Pasha; it is now commonly known as the \"Metternich Stele.\"  The Legend is narrated by the goddess herself, who says:    I am Isis. I escaped from the dwelling wherein my brother Set placed me.  Thoth, the great god, the Prince of Truth in heaven and on earth, said  unto me: \"Come, O goddess Isis [hearken thou], it is a good thing to  hearken, for he who is guided by another liveth. Hide thyself with thy  child, and these things shall happen unto him. His body shall grow and  flourish, and strength of every kind shall be in him. He shall sit upon  his father's throne, he shall avenge him, and he shall hold the exalted  position of 'Governor of the Two Lands.'\" I left the house of Set in the  evening, and there accompanied me Seven Scorpions, that were to travel  with me, and sting with their stings on my behalf. Two of them, Tefen  and Befen, followed behind me, two of them, Mestet and Mestetef, went  one on each side of me, and three, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet, prepared  the way for me. I charged them very carefully and adjured them to make  no acquaintance with any one, to speak to none of the Red Fiends, to pay  no heed to a servant (?), and to keep their gaze towards the ground so  that they might show me the way. And their leader brought me to Pa-Sui,  the town of the Sacred Sandals,[1] at the head of the district of the  Papyrus Swamps. When I arrived at Teb I came to a quarter of the town  where women dwelt. And a certain woman of quality spied me as I was  journeying along the road, and she shut her door in my face, for she was  afraid because of the Seven Scorpions that were with me. Then they took  counsel concerning her, and they shot out their poison on the tail of  Tefen. As for me, a peasant woman called Taha opened her door, and I  went into the house of this humble woman. Then the scorpion Tefen  crawled in under the door of the woman Usert [who had shut it in my  face], and stung her son, and a fire broke out in it; there was no water  to put it out, but the sky sent down rain, though it was not the time of  rain. And the heart of Usert was sore within her, and she was very sad,  for she knew not whether her son would live or die; and she went through  the town shrieking for help, but none came out at the sound of her  voice. And I was sad for the child's sake, and I wished the innocent one  to live again. So I cried out to her, saying, Come to me! Come to me!  There is life in my mouth. I am a woman well known in her town. I can  destroy the devil of death by a spell which my father taught me. I am  his daughter, his beloved one.    [Footnote 1: These places were in the seventh nome of Lower Egypt  (Metelites).]    Then Isis laid her hands on the child and recited this spell:    \"O poison of Tefent, come forth, fall on the ground; go no further. O  poison of Befent, come forth, fall on the ground. I am Isis, the  goddess, the mistress of words of power. I am a weaver of spells, I know  how to utter words so that they take effect. Hearken to me, O every  reptile that biteth (or stingeth), and fall on the ground. O poison of  Mestet, go no further. O poison of Mestetef, rise not up in his body. O  poison of Petet and Thetet, enter not his body. O poison of Maatet, fall  on the ground. Ascend not into heaven, I command you by the beloved of  Ra, the egg of the goose which appeareth from the sycamore. My words  indeed rule to the uttermost limit of the night. I speak to you, O  scorpions. I am alone and in sorrow, and our names will stink throughout  the nomes.... The child shall live! The poison shall die! For Ra liveth  and the poison dieth. Horus shall be saved through his mother Isis, and  he who is stricken shall likewise be saved.\" Meanwhile the fire in the  house of Usert was extinguished, and heaven was content with the  utterance of Isis. Then the lady Usert was filled with sorrow because  she had shut her door in the face of Isis, and she brought to the house  of the peasant woman gifts for the goddess, whom she had apparently not  recognised. The spells of the goddess produced, of course, the desired  effect on the poison, and we may assume that the life of the child was  restored to him. The second lot of gifts made to Isis represented his  mother's gratitude.    Exactly when and how Isis made her way to a hiding place cannot be said,  but she reached it in safety, and her son Horus was born there. The  story of the death of Horus she tells in the following words: \"I am  Isis. I conceived a child, Horus, and I brought him forth in a cluster  of papyrus plants (or, bulrushes). I rejoiced exceedingly, for in him I  saw one who would make answer for his father. I hid him, and I covered  him up carefully, being afraid of that foul one [Set], and then I went  to the town of Am, where the people gave thanks for me because they knew  I could cause them trouble. I passed the day in collecting food for the  child, and when I returned and took Horus into my arms, I found him,  Horus, the beautiful one of gold, the boy, the child, lifeless! He had  bedewed the ground with the water of his eye and with the foam of his  lips. His body was motionless, his heart did not beat, and his muscles  were relaxed.\" Then Isis sent forth a bitter cry, and lamented loudly  her misfortune, for now that Horus was dead she had none to protect her,  or to take vengeance on Set. When the people heard her voice they went  out to her, and they bewailed with her the greatness of her affliction.  But though all lamented on her behalf there was none who could bring  back Horus to life. Then a \"woman who was well known in her town, a lady  who was the mistress of property in her own right,\" went out to Isis,  and consoled her, and assured her that the child should live through his  mother. And she said, \"A scorpion hath stung him, the reptile Aunab hath  wounded him.\" Then Isis bent her face over the child to find out if he  breathed, and she examined the wound, and found that there was poison in  it, and then taking him in her arms, \"she leaped about with him like a  fish that is put upon hot coals,\" uttering loud cries of lamentation.  During this outburst of grief the goddess Nephthys, her sister, arrived,  and she too lamented and cried bitterly over her sister's loss; with  her came the Scorpion-goddess Serqet. Nephthys at once advised Isis to  cry out for help to Ra, for, said she, it is wholly impossible for the  Boat of Ra to travel across the sky whilst Horus is lying dead. Then  Isis cried out, and made supplication to the Boat of Millions of Years,  and the Sun-god stopped the Boat. Out of it came down Thoth, who was  provided with powerful spells, and, going to Isis, he inquired  concerning her trouble. \"What is it, what is it, O Isis, thou goddess of  spells, whose mouth hath skill to utter them with supreme effect? Surely  no evil thing hath befallen Horus, for the Boat of Ra hath him under its  protection. I have come from the Boat of the Disk to heal Horus.\" Then  Thoth told Isis not to fear, but to put away all anxiety from her heart,  for he had come to heal her child, and he told her that Horus was fully  protected because he was the Dweller in his disk, and the firstborn son  of heaven, and the Great Dwarf, and the Mighty Ram, and the Great Hawk,  and the Holy Beetle, and the Hidden Body, and the Governor of the Other  World, and the Holy Benu Bird, and by the spells of Isis and the names  of Osiris and the weeping of his mother and brethren, and by his own  name and heart. Turning towards the child Thoth began to recite his  spells and said, \"Wake up, Horus! Thy protection is established. Make  thou happy the heart of thy mother Isis. The words of Horus bind up  hearts and he comforteth him that is in affliction. Let your hearts  rejoice, O ye dwellers in the heavens. Horus who avenged his father  shall make the poison to retreat. That which is in the mouth of Ra shall  circulate, and the tongue of the Great God shall overcome [opposition].  The Boat of Ra standeth still and moveth not, and the Disk (_i.e._ the  Sun-god) is in the place where it was yesterday to heal Horus for his  mother Isis. Come to earth, draw nigh, O Boat of Ra, O ye mariners of  Ra; make the boat to move and convey food of the town of Sekhem (_i.e._  Letopolis) hither, to heal Horus for his mother Isis.... Come to earth,  O poison! I am Thoth, the firstborn son, the son of Ra. Tem and "]]]
