The story ran through the town like fire among girdled trees, and  became so much the universal talk that nobody could tell whence it had  originated. Mr. Higginbotham was as well known at Parker's Falls as  any citizen of the place, being part-owner of the slitting-mill and a  considerable stockholder in the cotton-factories. The inhabitants felt  their own prosperity interested in his fate. Such was the excitement  that the Parker's Falls _Gazette_ anticipated its regular day of  publication, and came out with half a form of blank paper and a column  of double pica emphasized with capitals and headed \"HORRID MURDER OF  MR. HIGGINBOTHAM!\" Among other dreadful details, the printed account  described the mark of the cord round the dead man's neck and stated  the number of thousand dollars of which he had been robbed; there was  much pathos, also, about the affliction of his niece, who had gone  from one fainting-fit to another ever since her uncle was found  hanging on the St. Michael's pear tree with his pockets inside out.  The village poet likewise commemorated the young lady's grief in  seventeen stanzas of a ballad. The selectmen held a meeting, and in  consideration of Mr. Higginbotham's claims on the town determined to  issue handbills offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the  apprehension of his murderers and the recovery of the stolen property.    Meanwhile, the whole population of Parker's Falls, consisting of  shopkeepers, mistresses of boarding-houses, factory-girls, mill-men  and schoolboys, rushed into the street and kept up such a terrible  loquacity as more than compensated for the silence of the  cotton-machines, which refrained from their usual din out of respect  to the deceased. Had Mr. Higginbotham cared about posthumous renown,  his untimely ghost would have exulted in this tumult.    Our friend Dominicus in his vanity of heart forgot his intended  precautions, and, mounting on the town-pump, announced himself as the  bearer of the authentic intelligence which had caused so wonderful a  sensation. He immediately became the great man of the moment, and had  just begun a new edition of the narrative with a voice like a  field-preacher when the mail-stage drove into the village street. It  had travelled all night, and must have shifted horses at Kimballton at  three in the morning.    \"Now we shall hear all the particulars!\" shouted the crowd.    The coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern followed by a  thousand people; for if any man had been minding his own business till  then, he now left it at sixes and sevens to hear the news. The pedler,  foremost in the race, discovered two passengers, both of whom had been  startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a  mob. Every man assailing them with separate questions, all propounded  at once, the couple were struck speechless, though one was a lawyer  and the other a young lady.    \"Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham! Tell us the particulars about old  Mr. Higginbotham!\" bawled the mob. \"What is the coroner's verdict? Are  the murderers apprehended? Is Mr. Higginbotham's niece come out of her  fainting-fits? Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham!\"    The coachman said not a word except to swear awfully at the hostler  for not bringing him a fresh team of horses. The lawyer inside had  generally his wits about him even when asleep; the first thing he did  after learning the cause of the excitement was to produce a large red  pocketbook. Meantime, Dominicus Pike, being an extremely polite young  man, and also suspecting that a female tongue would tell the story as  glibly as a lawyer's, had handed the lady out of the coach. She was a  fine, smart girl, now wide awake and bright as a button, and had such  a sweet, pretty mouth that Dominicus would almost as lief have heard a  love-tale from it as a tale of murder.    \"Gentlemen and ladies,\" said the lawyer to the shopkeepers, the  mill-men and the factory-girls, \"I can assure you that some  unaccountable mistake--or, more probably, a wilful falsehood  maliciously contrived to injure Mr. Higginbotham's credit--has excited  this singular uproar. We passed through Kimballton at three o'clock  this morning, and most certainly should have been informed of the  murder had any been perpetrated. But I have proof nearly as strong as  Mr. Higginbotham's own oral testimony in the negative. Here is a note  relating to a suit of his in the Connecticut courts which was  delivered me from that gentleman himself. I find it dated at ten  o'clock last evening.\"    So saying, the lawyer, exhibited the date and signature of the note,  which irrefragably proved either that this perverse Mr. Higginbotham  was alive when he wrote it, or, as some deemed the more probable case  of two doubtful ones, that he was so absorbed in worldly business as  to continue to transact it even after his death. But unexpected  evidence was forthcoming. The young lady, after listening to the  pedler's explanation, merely seized a moment to smooth her gown and  put her curls in order, and then appeared at the tavern door, making a  modest signal to be heard.    \"Good people,\" said she, \"I am Mr. Higginbotham's niece.\"    A wondering murmur passed through the crowd on beholding her so rosy  and bright--that same unhappy niece whom they had supposed, on the  authority of the Parker's Falls _Gazette_, to be lying at death's  door in a fainting-fit. But some shrewd fellows had doubted all along  whether a young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of a  rich old uncle.    \"You see,\" continued Miss Higginbotham, with a smile, \"that this  strange story is quite unfounded as to myself, and I believe I may  affirm it to be equally so in regard to my dear uncle Higginbotham. He  has the kindness to give me a home in his house, though I contribute  to my own support by teaching a school. I left Kimballton this morning  to spend the vacation of commencement-week with a friend about five  miles from Parker's Falls. My generous uncle, when he heard me on the  stairs, called me to his bedside and gave me two dollars and fifty  cents to pay my stage-fare, and another dollar for my extra expenses.  He then laid his pocketbook under his pillow, shook hands with me, and  advised me to take some biscuit in my bag instead of breakfasting on  the road. I feel confident, therefore, that I left my beloved relative  alive, and trust that I shall find him so on my return.\"    The young lady courtesied at the close of her speech, which was so  sensible and well worded, and delivered with such grace and propriety,  that everybody thought her fit to be preceptress of the best academy  in the State. But a stranger would have supposed that Mr. Higginbotham  was an object of abhorrence at Parker's Falls and that a thanksgiving  had been proclaimed for his murder, so excessive was the wrath of the  inhabitants on learning their mistake. The mill-men resolved to bestow  public honors on Dominicus Pike, only hesitating whether to tar and  feather him, ride him on a rail or refresh him with an ablution at the  town-pump, on the top of which he had declared himself the bearer of  the news. The selectmen, by advice of the lawyer, spoke of prosecuting  him for a misdemeanor in circulating unfounded reports, to the great  disturbance of the peace of the commonwealth. Nothing saved Dominicus  either from mob-law or a court of justice but an eloquent appeal made  by the young lady in his behalf. Addressing a few words of heartfelt  gratitude to his benefactress, he mounted the green cart and rode out  of town under a discharge of artillery from the schoolboys, who found  plenty of ammunition in the neighboring clay-pits and mud-holes. As he  turned his head to exchange a farewell glance with Mr. Higginbotham's  niece a ball of the consistence of hasty-pudding hit him slap in the  mouth, giving him a most grim aspect. His whole person was so  bespattered with the like filthy missiles that he had almost a mind to  ride back and supplicate for the threatened ablution at the town-pump;  for, though not meant in kindness, it would now have been a deed of  charity.    However, the sun shone bright on poor Dominicus, and the mud--an  emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium--was easily brushed off  when dry. Being a funny rogue, his heart soon cheered up; nor could he  refrain from a hearty laugh at the uproar which his story had excited.  The handbills of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the  vagabonds in the State, the paragraph in the Parker's Falls _Gazette_  would be reprinted from Maine to Florida, and perhaps form an item in  the London newspapers, and many a miser would tremble for his  moneybags and life on learning the catastrophe of Mr. Higginbotham.  The pedler meditated with much fervor on the charms of the young  schoolmistress, and swore that Daniel Webster never spoke nor looked  so like an angel as Miss Higginbotham while defending him from the  wrathful populace at Parker's Falls.    Dominicus was now on the Kimballton turnpike, having all along  determined to visit that place, though business had drawn, him out of  the most direct road from Morristown. As he approached the scene of  the supposed murder he continued to revolve the circumstances in his  mind, and was astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed.  Had nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first traveller,  it might now have been considered as a hoax; but the yellow man was  evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact, and there was  a mystery in his dismayed and guilty look on being abruptly  questioned. When to this singular combination of incidents it was  added that the rumor tallied exactly with Mr. Higginbotham's character  and habits of life, and that he had an orchard and a St. Michael's  pear tree, near which he always passed at nightfall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#20)"],[1,"erk. He was leaning,  with folded arms, over a bale of blankets, engaged in bargaining, when  he received a deadly stab in the back, and fell down the companion-way.    Mr. M'Kay, who was seated on the taffrail, sprang on his feet, but was  instantly knocked down with a war-club and flung backwards into the sea,  where he was despatched by the women in the canoes.    In the meantime Captain Thorn made desperate fight against fearful odds.  He was a powerful as well as a resolute man, but he had come upon  deck without weapons. Shewish, the young chief singled him out as his  peculiar prey, and rushed upon him at the first outbreak. The captain  had barely time to draw a clasp-knife with one blow of which he laid  the young savage dead at his feet. Several of the stoutest followers  of Shewish now set upon him. He defended himself vigorously, dealing  crippling blows to right and left, and strewing the quarter-deck with  the slain and wounded. His object was to fight his way to the cabin,  where there were fire-arms; but he was hemmed in with foes, covered with  wounds, and faint with loss of blood. For an instant he leaned upon the  tiller wheel, when a blow from behind, with a war-club, felled him to  the deck, where he was despatched with knives and thrown overboard.    While this was transacting upon the quarter-deck, a chance-medley fight  was going on throughout the ship. The crew fought desperately with  knives, handspikes, and whatever weapon they could seize upon in the  moment of surprise. They were soon, however, overpowered by numbers, and  mercilessly butchered.    As to the seven who had been sent aloft to make sail, they contemplated  with horror the carnage that was going on below. Being destitute of  weapons, they let themselves down by the running rigging, in hopes  of getting between decks. One fell in the attempt, and was instantly  despatched; another received a death-blow in the back as he was  descending; a third, Stephen Weekes, the armorer, was mortally wounded  as he was getting down the hatchway.    The remaining four made good their retreat into the cabin, where they  found Mr. Lewis, still alive, though mortally wounded. Barricading the  cabin door, they broke holes through the companion-way, and, with the  muskets and ammunition which were at hand, opened a brisk fire that soon  cleared the deck.    Thus far the Indian interpreter, from whom these particulars are  derived, had been an eye-witness to the deadly conflict. He had taken no  part in it, and had been spared by the natives as being of their race.  In the confusion of the moment he took refuge with the rest, in the  canoes. The survivors of the crew now sallied forth, and discharged some  of the deck-guns, which did great execution among the canoes, and drove  all the savages to shore.    For the remainder of the day no one ventured to put off to the ship,  deterred by the effects of the fire-arms. The night passed away without  any further attempts on the part of the natives. When the day dawned,  the Tonquin still lay at anchor in the bay, her sails all loose and  flapping in the wind, and no one apparently on board of her. After a  time, some of the canoes ventured forth to reconnoitre, taking with them  the interpreter.    They paddled about her, keeping cautiously at a distance, but growing  more and more emboldened at seeing her quiet and lifeless. One man  at length made his appearance on the deck, and was recognized by the  interpreter as Mr. Lewis. He made friendly signs, and invited them on  board. It was long before they ventured to comply. Those who mounted  the deck met with no opposition; no one was to be seen on board; for Mr.  Lewis, after inviting them, had disappeared. Other canoes now pressed  forward to board the prize; the decks were soon crowded, and the sides  covered with clambering savages, all intent on plunder. In the midst  of their eagerness and exultation, the ship blew up with a tremendous  explosion. Arms, legs, and mutilated bodies were blown into the air, and  dreadful havoc was made in the surrounding canoes. The interpreter was  in the main-chains at the time of the explosion, and was thrown unhurt  into the water, where he succeeded in getting into one of the canoes.  According to his statement, the bay presented an awful spectacle after  the catastrophe. The ship had disappeared, but the bay was covered with  fragments of the wreck, with shattered canoes, and Indians swimming for  their lives, or struggling in the agonies of death; while those who had  escaped the danger remained aghast and stupefied, or made with frantic  panic for the shore. Upwards of a hundred savages were destroyed by the  explosion, many more were shockingly mutilated, and for days afterwards  the limbs and bodies of the slain were thrown upon the beach.    The inhabitants of Neweetee were overwhelmed with consternation at this  astounding calamity, which had burst upon them in the very moment of  triumph. The warriors sat mute and mournful, while the women filled  the air with loud lamentations. Their weeping and walling, however, was  suddenly changed into yells of fury at the sight of four unfortunate  white men, brought captive into the village. They had been driven on  shore in one of the ship's boats, and taken at some distance along the  coast.    The interpreter was permitted to converse with them. They proved to  be the four brave fellows who had made such desperate defense from  the cabin. The interpreter gathered from them some of the particulars  already related. They told him further, that after they had beaten off  the enemy and cleared the ship, Lewis advised that they should slip  the cable and endeavor to get to sea. They declined to take his advice,  alleging that the wind set too strongly into the bay and would drive  them on shore. They resolved, as soon as it was dark, to put off quietly  in the ship's boat, which they would be able to do unperceived, and to  coast along back to Astoria. They put their resolution into effect; but  Lewis refused to accompany them, being disabled by his wound, hopeless  of escape, and determined on a terrible revenge. On the voyage out, he  had repeatedly expressed a presentiment that he should die by his own  hands; thinking it highly probable that he should be engaged in some  contest with the natives, and being resolved, in case of extremity,  to commit suicide rather than be made a prisoner. He now declared his  intention to remain on board of the ship until daylight, to decoy as  many of the savages on board as possible, then to set fire to the powder  magazine, and terminate his life by a signal of vengeance. How well he  succeeded has been shown. His companions bade him a melancholy adieu,  and set off on their precarious expedition. They strove with might and  main to get out of the bay, but found it impossible to weather a point  of land, and were at length compelled to take shelter in a small cove,  where they hoped to remain concealed until the wind should be more  favorable. Exhausted by fatigue and watching, they fell into a sound  sleep, and in that state were surprised by the savages. Better had it  been for those unfortunate men had they remained with Lewis, and  shared his heroic death: as it was, they perished in a more painful and  protracted manner, being sacrificed by the natives to the manes of their  friends with all the lingering tortures of savage cruelty. Some time  after their death, the interpreter, who had remained a kind of prisoner  at large, effected his escape, and brought the tragical tidings to  Astoria.    Such is the melancholy story of the Tonquin, and such was the fate of  her brave but headstrong commander, and her adventurous crew. It is a  catastrophe that shows the importance, in all enterprises of moment,  to keep in mind the general instructions of the sagacious heads which  devise them. Mr. Astor was well aware of the perils to which ships  were exposed on this coast from quarrels with the natives, and from  perfidious attempts of the latter to surprise and capture them in  unguarded moments. He had repeatedly enjoined it upon Captain Thorn,  in conversation, and at parting, in his letter of instructions, to be  courteous and kind in his dealings with the savages, but by no means to  confide in their apparent friendship, nor to admit more than a few on  board of his ship at a time.    Had the deportment of Captain Thorn been properly regulated, the insult  so wounding to savage pride would never have been given. Had he enforced  the rule to admit but a few at a time, the savages would not have been  able to get the mastery. He was too irritable, however, to practice the  necessary self-command, and, having been nurtured in a proud contempt of  danger, thought it beneath him to manifest any fear of a crew of unarmed  savages.    With all his faults and foibles, we cannot but speak of him with esteem,  and deplore his untimely fate; for we remember him well in early life,  as a companion in pleasant scenes and joyous hours. When on shore, among  his friends, he was a frank, manly, sound-hearted sailor. On board  ship he evidently assumed the hardness of deportment and sternness of  demeanor which many deem essential to naval service. Throughout  the whole of the expedition, however, he showed himself loyal,  single-minded, straightforward, and fearless; and if the fate of  his vessel may be charged to his harshness and imprudence, we should  recollect that he paid for his error with his life.    The loss of the Tonquin was a grievous blow to the infant establishment  of Astoria, and one that threatened to bring after it a train of  disasters. The intelligence of it did not reach Mr. Astor until many  months afterwards. He felt it in all its force, and was aware that it  must cripple, if not entirely defeat, the great scheme of his ambition.  In his letters, written at the time, he speaks of it as \"a calamity,"]]]
