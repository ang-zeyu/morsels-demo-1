Koch made an experiment to ascertain whether a very low temperature not  merely checked development but killed them, and subjected the comma  bacilli to a temperature of 10 deg. C. They were then completely frozen, but  yet retained vitality, growing in gelatine afterward. Other experiments,  by excluding air from the gelatine cultures, or placing them under an  exhausted bell jar, or in an atmosphere of carbonic acid, went to prove  that they required air and oxygen for their growth; but the deprivation  did not kill them, since on removing them from these conditions they again  began to grow.    The growth of these bacilli is exceptionally rapid, quickly attaining its  height, and after a brief stationary period as quickly terminating. The  dying bacilli lose their shape, sometimes appearing shriveled, sometimes  swollen, and then staining very slightly or not at all. The special  features of their vegetation are best seen when substances which also  contain other forms of bacteria are taken--_e. g_., the intestinal  contents or choleraic evacuations mixed with moistened earth or linen and  kept damp. The comma bacilli in these conditions multiply with great  rapidity so as to far outnumber the other forms of bacteria, which at  first might have been in far greater abundance. This state of affairs does  not last long; in two or three days the comma bacilli began to die off,  and the other bacteria began to multiply. Precisely the same thing takes  place in the intestine, where, after the rapid initial vegetation is over,  and when exudation of blood occurs in the bowel, the comma bacilli  disappear and putrefactive bacteria predominate. Whether the occurrence of  putrefaction is inimical to the comma bacilli has not been proved, but  from analogy it is very probable. At any rate, it is important to know  this for certain, for if it be so, then the comma bacilli will not thrive  in a cesspit, and then further disinfection would be unnecessary. These  bacilli thrive best in fluids containing a certain amount of nutriment.  Experiments have not yet shown the limits in this respect, but Koch has  found them capable of growing in meat broth diluted ten times.    Again, if the nutrient medium become acid in reaction their growth is  checked, at least in gelatine and meat infusion; but singularly enough,  they continue to grow on the surface of a boiled potato which has become  acid, showing that all acids are not equally obnoxious to them. But here,  as with other substances which hinder their growth, they do not kill the  bacilli. Davaine has shown that iodine is a strong bactericide. He  experimented with anthrax bacilli in water to which iodine was added, and  the bacilli were destroyed. But practically the organisms have to be dealt  with in the alkaline contents of the bowel, or in the blood or fluids of  the tissues, where iodine cannot remain in the free state. Koch found that  the addition of an aqueous solution of iodine (1 in 4,000) to meat  infusion, in the proportion of 1 in 10, did not in the least interfere  with the growth of the bacilli in that medium. He did not pursue this line  of inquiry, seeing that in practice larger quantities of iodine than that  could not be given. Alcohol first checks the development of the comma  bacilli when it is mixed with the nutrient fluid in the proportion of 1 in  10, a degree of concentration which renders it impracticable for  treatment. Common salt was added to the extent of 2 per cent. without  influencing the growth of the bacilli. Sulphate of iron, in the proportion  of 2 per cent., checks this growth, probably by precipitating albumimites  from the fluids, and possibly also by its acid reaction; certainly it does  not seem to have any specific disinfecting action--i.e., in destroying the  bacilli. Indeed, Koch thinks that the admixture of sulphate of iron with  faecal matter may arrest putrefaction, and really remove what may be the  most destructive process to the comma bacilli. Hence he would distinguish  between substances which merely arrest putrefaction and those which are  bactericidal; for the former may simply serve the purpose of preserving  the infective virus. Among other substances which prevent the growth of  the comma bacilli may be mentioned alum, in solutions of the strength of 1  in 100; camphor, 1 in 300; carbolic acid, 1 in 400; oil of peppermint, 1  in 2,000; sulphate of copper, 1 in 2,500 (a remedy much employed, but how  much would really be needed merely to hinder the growth of the bacilli in  the intestine!); quinine, 1 in 5,000; and sublimate, 1 in 100,000. In  contrast with the foregoing measures for preventing the growth of these  bacilli is the striking fact that they are readily killed by drying. This  fact is proved by merely drying a small drop of material containing the  bacilli on a cover-glass, and then placing this over some of the fluid on  a glass slide. With anthrax bacilli vitality is retained for nearly a  week; whereas, the comma bacillus appears to be killed in a very short  time. Thus it was found that although vitality was retained--depending  largely upon the number of bacilli--for a short time, yet withdrawal of  the nutrient fluid for an hour or even less often sufficed; and it never  happened that the bacilli retained vitality after a deprivation lasting  twenty-four hours. These results would seem to point to the fact that the  comma bacillus does not, like the organisms of anthrax and vaccinia, pass  into the resting state (Daner-zustande) by drying; and if so, it is one of  the most important facts in the etiology of cholera. Much, however,  remains to be done, especially with regard to the soiled linen of cholera  patients being kept in a damp state. He found that in soiled articles,  when dried for a time, varying from twenty-four hours and upward, the  comma bacilli were quite destroyed. Nor was the destruction delayed by  placing choleraic excreta in or upon earth, dry or moist, or mixed with  stagnant water. In gelatine cultures the comma bacilli can be cultivated  for six weeks, and also in blood serum, milk, and potato, where anthrax  bacilli rapidly form spores. But a resting state of the comma bacilli has  never been met with--a very exceptional thing in the case of bacilli, and  another reason why the organism must be regarded rather as a spirillum  than a bacillus, for the spirilla require only a fluid medium, and do not,  like the anthrax bacilli, thrive in a dry state. It is quite unlikely that  a resting state of the comma bacillus will ever be discovered; and,  moreover, its absence harmonizes with our knowledge of cholera  etiology.--_The Lancet_.           *       *       *       *       *    [THE MEDICAL RECORD.]          MALARIA.--THE NATURAL PRODUCTION OF MALARIA, AND THE MEANS OF MAKING  MALARIAL COUNTRIES HEALTHIER.    [Footnote: An Address delivered at the Eighth Session of the International  Medical Congress, Copenhagen, August 12, 1884.]    By Conrad Tommasi Crudeli, M.D., Professor of Hygiene, University of Rome,  Italy.      Before entering upon my subject, I must crave the indulgence of those of  my colleagues whose language I have borrowed for any italicisms that I may  use, as well as for the foreign accent which must strike their ears more  or less disagreeably. Desiring to respond as well as lay in my power to  the invitation with which I have been honored to discuss the hygienic  questions relating to malaria, I have chosen the French language as being  the one in which, apart from my mother tongue, I could express myself with  the greatest ease and precision.    I shall be pardoned also, I hope, for having employed the terms \"malaria\"  and \"malarial districts\" in place of the more commonly used expressions  \"paludal miasm\" (_miasme paludeen_) and \"marshy regions\" (_contrees  marecageuses_). The substitution is not a happy one from a literary point  of view, but I have made it deliberately and for the following reason: The  idea that intermittent and pernicious fevers are engendered by putrid  emanations from swamps and marshes is one of those semi-scientific  assumptions which have contributed most to lead astray the investigations  of scientists and the work of public administrations. This idea, so  widespread and so well established by the traditions of the school, is  radically false. The specific ferment which engenders those fevers by its  accumulation in the atmosphere which we breathe is not exclusively of  paludal origin, and still less is it a product of putrefaction. Indeed, in  every region of the globe between the two Arctic circles there are swamps  and marshes, steeping-tanks of hemp and flax, large deltas where salt and  fresh waters mix, and yet there is no malaria there, although putrid  decomposition is on every side. On the other hand, in the same parts of  the globe there are places which are not and never were marshy, and in  which there is not the least trace of putrefaction, but which,  nevertheless, produce malaria in abundance. I reject, therefore, wholly  the paludal assumption, and in order to express this view in the title of  my paper, have been forced to employ terms which to my hearers may sound  like italicisms.    The Italians generally have not this paludal notion, for experience taught  them long ago that malaria is produced nearly everywhere--in marshy  districts as well as in those which might almost be called arid; in a  volcanic soil as well as in the deposits of the Miocene and Pliocene  periods and the ancient and modern alluvia; in a soil rich in organic  matters as well as in one containing almost none; in the plains as well as  on the hills or mountains. The word malaria (bad air), which it is the sad  privilege of Italy to have lent to all languages to express the cause of  intermittent and pernicious fevers, represents, then, among the majority  of our rural populations, the idea of an agent which may infect any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#20)"],[1,"of its produce depend even on more than a similarity  of soil and geographical position.

The _Johns Hopkins University Circular_, No. 85, issued in February,  contains Prof. Rowland's report of progress in spectrum work. The  spectra of all known elements, with the exception of a few gaseous ones,  or those too rare to be yet obtained, have been photographed in  connection with the solar spectrum, from the extreme ultra-violet down  to the D line, and eye observations have been made on many to the limit  of the solar spectrum. A table of standard wave lengths of the  impurities in the carbon poles extending to wave length 2,000 has been  constructed to measure wave lengths beyond the limits of the solar  spectrum. In addition to this, maps of the spectra of some of the  elements have been drawn up on a large scale, ready for publication, and  the greater part of the lines in the map of the solar spectrum have been  identified. The following rough table of the solar elements has been  constructed entirely according to Prof. Rowland's own observations,  although, of course, most of them have been given by others:    _Elements in the Sun, arranged according to Intensity and the Number of  Lines in the Solar Spectrum_.      According to intensity.             According to number.      Calcium   Zirconium         Iron (2,000 or more) Magnesium (20 or more)    Iron      Molybdenum        Nickel               Sodium (11)    Hydrogen  Lanthanum         Titanium             Silicon    Sodium    Niobium           Manganese            Strontium    Nickel    Palladium         Chromium             Barium    Magnesium Neodymium         Cobalt               Aluminum (4)    Cobalt    Copper            Carbon (200 or more) Cadmium    Silicon   Zinc              Vanadium             Rhodium    Aluminum  Cadmium           Zirconium            Erbium    Titanium  Cerium            Cerium               Zinc    Chromium  Glucinum          Calcium (75 or more) Copper (2)    Manganese Germanium         Scandium             Silver (2)    Strontium Rhodium           Neodymium            Glucinum (2)    Vanadium  Silver            Lanthanum            Germanium    Barium    Tin               Yttrium              Tin    Carbon    Lead              Niobium              Lead (1)    Scandium  Erbium            Molybdenum           Potassium (1)    Yttrium   Potassium         Palladium    _Doubtful Elements_.    Iridium, osmium, platinum, ruthenium, tantalum, thorium, tungsten,  uranium.    _Not in Solar Spectrum_.    Antimony, arsenic, bismuth, boron, nitrogen, caesium, gold, indium,  mercury, phosphorus, rubidium, selenium, sulphur, thallium,  praseodymium.    With respect to these tables, Prof. Rowland adds: \"The substances under  the head of 'Not in the Solar Spectrum' are often placed there because  the elements have few strong lines or none at all in the limit of the  solar spectrum when the arc spectrum, which I have used, is employed.  Thus, boron has only two strong lines at 2497. Again, the lines of  bismuth are all compound, and so too diffuse to appear in the solar  spectrum. Indeed, some good reason generally appears for their absence  from the solar spectrum. Of course, there is but little evidence of  their absence from the sun itself; were the whole earth heated to the  temperature of the sun, its spectrum would probably resemble that of the  sun very closely.\"    The powerful instrument used at Baltimore for photographing spectra, and  the measuring engine constructed to fit the photographs so that its  readings give the wave lengths of lines directly within 1/100 of a  division on Angstroem's scale, give the foregoing results a weight  superior to many others published.           *       *       *       *       *          ALLOTROPIC FORMS OF METALS.      Writing on some curious properties of metals and alloys, Mr. W.C.  Roberts-Austen, says the _Engineer_, remarks that the importance of the  isomeric and allotropic states has been much neglected in the case of  metals. Joule and Lyon Playfair showed, in 1846, that metals in  different allotropic states possess different atomic volumes, and  Matthiessen, in 1860, was led to the view that in certain cases where  metals are alloyed they pass into allotropic states, probably the most  important generalization which has yet been made in connection with the  molecular constitution of alloys. Instances of allotropy in pure metals  are: Bolley's lead, which oxidizes readily in air; Schutzenberger's  copper; Fritsche' tin, which falls to powder when exposed to  exceptionally cold winter; Gore's antimony; Graham's palladium and  allotropic nickel. Joule has also proved that, when iron is released  from its amalgam by distilling away the mercury, the metallic iron takes  fire on exposure to air, and is therefore clearly different from  ordinary iron.           *       *       *       *       *          A New Catalogue of Valuable Papers      Contained in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT during the past ten years,  sent _free of charge_ to any address.
