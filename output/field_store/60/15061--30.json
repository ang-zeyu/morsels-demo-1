Haw-Haw waited until the door  closed; then he wound his arms about his body, writhed in an ecstasy of  silent laughter, and followed with long, shambling strides.          CHAPTER XVII    BUCK MAKES HIS GET-AWAY      Straight from the room of the dead man, Fatty Matthews had hurried down  to the bar, and there he stepped into the silence and found the battery  of eyes all turned upon that calm figure at the end of the room. Upon  this man he trotted, breathing hard, and his fat sides jostled up and  down as he ran. According to Brownsville, there were only two things  that could make Fatty run: a gun or the sight of a drink. But all maxims  err. When he reached Barry he struck him on the shoulder with a heavy  hand. That is, he struck at the shoulder, but as if the shadow of the  falling hand carried a warning before it, at the same time that it  dropped Barry swerved around in his chair. Not a hurried movement, but  in some mysterious manner his shoulder was not in the way of the plump  fist. It struck, instead, upon the back of the chair, and the marshal  cursed bitterly.    \"Stranger,\" he said hotly, \"I got one thing to say: Jerry Strann has  just died upstairs. In ten seconds Mac Strann will be down here lookin'  for _you_!\"    He stepped back, humming desperately to cover his wheezing, but Barry  continued to braid the horsehair with deft fingers.    \"I got a double knot that's kind of new,\" he said. \"Want to watch me  tie it?\"    The deputy sheriff turned on the crowd.    \"Boys,\" he exclaimed, waving his arms, \"he's crazy. You heard what he  said. You know I've give him fair warning. If we got to dig his grave in  Brownsville, is it my fault? It ain't!\" He stepped to the bar and  pounded upon it. \"O'Brien, for God's sake, a drink!\"    It was a welcome suggestion to the entire nervous crowd, but while the  glasses spun across the bar Buck Daniels walked slowly down the length  of the barroom towards Barry. His face was a study which few men could  have solved; unless there had been someone present who had seen a man  walk to his execution. Beside Dan Barry he stopped and watched the agile  hands at work. There was a change in the position of Barry now, for he  had taken the chair facing the door and the entire crowd; Buck Daniels  stood opposite. The horsehair plied back and forth. And Daniels noted  the hands, lean, tapering like the fingers of a girl of sixteen. They  were perfectly steady; they were the hands of one who had struggled, in  life, with no greater foe than ennui.    \"Dan,\" said Buck, and there was a quiver of excitement in his voice,  like the tremor of a piano string long after it has been struck. \"Dan, I  been thinking about something and now I'm ready to tell you what it is.\"    Barry looked up in slow surprise.    Now the face of Buck Daniels held what men have called a \"deadly  pallor,\" that pallor which comes over one who is cornered and about to  fight for his life. He leaned closer, resting one hand upon the edge of  the table, so that his face was close to Dan Barry.    \"Barry,\" he said, \"I'm askin' you for the last time: Will you get your  hoss and ride back to Kate Cumberland with me?\"    Dan Barry smiled his gentle, apologetic smile.    \"I don't no ways see how I can, Buck.\"    \"Then,\" said Buck through his teeth, \"of all the lyin' hounds in the  world you're the lyin'est and meanest and lowest. Which they ain't words  to tell you what I think of you. Take this instead!\"    And the hand which rested on the table darted up and smote Dan Barry on  the cheek, a tingling blow. With the same motion which started his hand  for the blow, Buck Daniels turned on his heel and stepped a pace or two  towards the centre of the room.    There was not a man in the room who had not heard the last words of Buck  Daniels, and not a man who had not seen the blow. Everyone of them had  seen, or heard accurately described, how the slender stranger beat Jerry  Strann to the draw and shot him down in that same place. Such a moan  came from them as when many men catch their breath with pain, and with a  simultaneous movement those who were in line with Buck Daniels and Barry  leaped back against the bar on one side and against the wall on the  other. Their eyes, fascinated, held on the face of Barry, and they saw  the pale outline which the fingers of Daniels had left on the cheek of  the other. But if horror was the first thing they felt, amazement was  the next. For Dan Barry sat bolt erect in his chair, staring in an  astonishment too great for words. His right hand hung poised and  moveless just above the butt of his gun; his whole posture was that of  one in the midst of an action, suspended there, frozen to stone. They  waited for that poised hand to drop, for the slender fingers to clutch  the butt of the gun, for the convulsive jerk that would bring out the  gleaming barrel, the explosion, the spurt of smoke, and Buck Daniels  lurching forward to his face on the floor.    But that hand did not move; and Buck Daniels? Standing there with his  back to the suspended death behind him, he drew out Durham and brown  papers, without haste, rolled a cigarette, and reached to a hip pocket.    At that move Dan Barry started. His hand darted down and fastened on his  gun, and he leaned forward in his chair with the yellow glimmering light  flaring up in his eyes. But the hand of Buck Daniels came out from his  hip bearing a match. He raised his leg, scratched the match, there was a  blue spurt of flame, and Buck calmly lighted his cigarette and started  towards the door, sauntering.    The instant the swinging doors closed Barry started from his chair with  a strange cry--none of them had ever heard the like from human lips--for  there was grief in it, and above all there was a deadly eagerness. So a  hungry man might cry out at the sight of food. Down the length of the  barroom he darted and was drawing his gun as he whipped through the  doors. A common rush followed him, and those who reached the open first  saw Buck Daniels leaning far forward in his saddle and spurring  desperately into the gloom of the night. Instantly he was only a  twinkling figure in the shadows, and the beat of the hoofs rattled back  at them. Dan Barry stood with his gun poised high for a second or more.  Then he turned, dropped the gun into the holster, and with the same  strange, unearthly cry of eagerness, he raced off in the direction of  the barns.    There were some who followed him even then, and this is what they  reported to incredulous ears when they returned. Barry ran straight for  the left hand corral and wrenched at the gate, which appeared to be  secured by a lock and chain. Seeing that it would not give way he ran  around to the barn, and came out again carrying a saddle and bridle.  These he tossed over the high fence into the corral. Then he picked up a  loose scantling and with it pried and wrenched off the top bar of the  fence in one section and vaulted into the enclosure.    The black stallion had whinnied once or twice during this time and the  great black, shaggy dog had come snarling and whining about the feet of  his master. Now the stranger tossed on the saddle and cinched it with  amazing speed, sprang onto his mount, and urged it across to the other  side of the corral. Up to that moment no one in the little crowd of  watchers had suspected the intention of the rider. For the fence, even  after the removal of the top bar, was nearly six feet in height. But  when Barry took his horse to the far side of the corral and then swung  him about facing the derailed section, it was plain that he meant to  attempt to jump at that place. Even then, as O'Brien explained later,  and many a time, the thing was so impossible that he could not believe  his eyes. There was a dreamlike element to the whole event. And like a  phantom in a vision he saw the black horse start into a sharp gallop;  saw the great dog sail across the fence first; saw the horse and rider  shoot into the air against the stars; heard the click of hoofs against  the top rail; heard the thud of hoofs on the near side of the fence, and  then the horseman flashed about the corner of the barn and in an instant  his hoofs were beating a far distant tattoo.    As for the watchers, they returned in a dead silence to the barroom and  they had hardly entered when Mac Strann stalked through the doors behind  them; he went straight to O'Brien.    \"Somewhere about,\" he said in his thick, deep voice, \"they's a man named  Dan Barry. Where is he?\"    And O'Brien answered: \"Mac, he was sittin' down there at that table  until two minutes ago, but where he is now I ain't any idea.\"    The tall, skeleton form of Haw-Haw Langley materialised behind Mac  Strann, and his face was contorted with anger.    \"If he was here two minutes ago,\" he said, \"he ain't more than two  minutes away.\"    \"Which way?\" asked Mac Strann.    \"North,\" answered a score of voices.    O'Brien stepped up to Mac Strann. He said: \"Mac, we know what you got in  your mind. We know what you've lost, and there ain't any of us that  ain't sorry for Jerry--and for you. But, Mac, I can give you the best  advice you ever heard in your life: Keep off'n the trail of Barry!\"    Haw-Haw Langley added at the ear of Mac Strann: \"That was Jerry's advice  when he lay dyin'. An' it's my advice, too. Mac, Barry ain't a safe man  to foller!\"    \"Haw-Haw,\" answered Mac Strann, \"Will you gimme a hand saddlin' my hoss?  I got an appointment, an' I'm two minutes late already.\"          CHAPTER XVIII    DOCTOR BYRNE ANALYSES      In the room which had been assigned to his use Doctor Randall Byrne sat  down to an unfinished letter and began to write.    \"Dinner has interrupted me, my dear Loughburne.

With ever-flowing fountains      I'll cool thy weary brow;    Thou'lt lose amid their rippling      The cares which grieve thee now.      In my white arms reposing,      And on my snow-white breast,    Thou'lt dream of old, old legends,      And sing in joy to rest.      I'll kiss thee and caress thee,      As in the ancient day    I kissed the Emperor Henry,      Who long has passed away.      The dead are dead and silent,      Only the living love;    And I am fair and blooming--      Dost feel my wild heart move!      And as my heart is beating,      My crystal castle rings,    Where many a knight and lady      In merry measure springs.      Silk trains are softly rustling,      Spurs ring from night to morn,    And dwarfs are gaily drumming,      And blow the golden horn.      As round the Emperor Henry,      My arms round thee shall fall;    I held his ears--he heard not      The trumpet's warning call.    We feel infinite happiness when the outer world blends with the world of  our own soul, and green trees, thoughts, the songs of birds, gentle  melancholy, the blue of heaven, memory, and the perfume of herbs, run  together in sweet arabesques. Women best understand this feeling, and  this may be the cause that such a sweet incredulous smile plays around  their lips when we, with scholastic pride, boast of our logical  deeds--how we have classified everything so nicely into subjective and  objective; how our heads are provided, apothecary-like, with a thousand  drawers, one of which contains reason, another understanding, the third  wit, the fourth bad wit, and the fifth nothing at all--that is to say,  the _Idea_.    As if wandering in dreams, I scarcely observed that we had left the  depths of the Ilsethal and were now again climbing uphill. This was  steep and difficult work, and many of us lost our breath; but, like our  late lamented cousin, who now lies buried at Moelln, we thought in  advance of the descent, and were all the merrier in consequence. Finally  we reached the Ilsenstein.    This is an enormous granite rock, which rises boldly on high from out a  glen. On three sides it is surrounded by high woody hills, but on the  fourth, the north side, there is an open view, and we gazed past the  Ilsenburg and the Ilse lying below us, far away into the low lands. On  the towerlike summit of the rock stands a great iron cross, and in case  of need there is also room here for four human feet. And as Nature,  through picturesque position and form, has adorned the Ilsenstein with  fantastic charms, so legend likewise has shed upon it a rosy shimmer.  According to Gottschalk, \"People say that there once stood here an  enchanted castle, in which dwelt the rich and fair Princess Ilse, who  still bathes every morning in the Ilse. He who is fortunate enough to  hit upon the exact time and place will be led by her into the rock where  her castle lies and receive a royal reward.\" Others narrate a pleasant  legend of the lovers of the Lady Ilse and of the Knight of Westenberg,  which has been romantically sung by one of our most noted poets in the  _Evening Journal_. Others again say that it was the Old Saxon Emperor  Henry who had a royal good time with the water-nymph Ilse in her  enchanted castle.    A later author, one Niemann, Esq., who has written a _Guide to the Harz_  in which the height of the hills, variations of the compass, town  finances, and similar matters are described with praiseworthy accuracy,  asserts, however, that \"what is narrated of the Princess Ilse belongs  entirely to the realm of fable.\" Thus do all men speak to whom a  beautiful princess has never appeared; but we who have been especially  favored by fair ladies know better. And the Emperor Henry knew it too!  It was not without cause that the Old Saxon emperors were so attached to  their native Harz. Let any one only turn over the leaves of the fair  _Lueneburg Chronicle,_ where the good old gentlemen are represented in  wondrously true-hearted woodcuts sitting in full armor on their mailed  war-steeds, the holy imperial crown on their beloved heads, sceptre and  sword in firm hands; and then in their dear mustachiod faces he can  plainly read how they often longed for the sweet hearts of their Harz  princesses, and for the familiar rustling of the Harz forests, when they  sojourned in distant lands--yes, even when in Italy, so rich in oranges  and poisons, whither they, with their followers, were often enticed by  the desire of being called Roman emperors, a genuine German lust for  title, which finally destroyed emperor and empire.    I, however, advise every one who may hereafter stand on the summit of  the Ilsenstein to think neither of emperor nor empire nor of the fair  Ilse, but simply of his own feet. For as I stood there, lost in thought,  I suddenly heard the subterranean music of the enchanted castle, and saw  the mountains around begin to stand on their heads, while the red-tiled  roofs of Ilsenburg were dancing, and green trees flew through the air,  until all was green and blue before my eyes, and I, overcome by  giddiness, would assuredly have fallen into the abyss, had I not, in the  dire need of my soul, clung fast to the iron cross. No one who reflects  on the critically ticklish situation in which I was then placed can  possibly find fault with me for having done this.    [Illustration: VIEW FROM ST. ANDREASBERG]           *       *       *       *       *          BOYHOOD DAYS[55]    By Heinrich Heine    Translated by Charles Godfrey Leland    The town of Duesseldorf is very beautiful, and if you think of it when  far away, and happen at the same time to have been born there, strange  feelings come over your soul. I was born there, and feel as if I must go  straight home. And when I say _home_ I mean the _Bolkerstrasse_ and the  house in which I was born. This house will some day be a great  curiosity, and I have sent word to the old lady who owns it that she  must not for her life sell it. For the whole house she would now hardly  get as much as the tips which the distinguished green-veiled English  ladies will one day give the servant girl when she shows them the room  where I was born, and the hen-house wherein my father generally  imprisoned me for stealing grapes, and also the brown door on which my  mother taught me to write with chalk--O Lord! Madame, should I ever  become a famous author, it has cost my poor mother trouble enough.    (1823-1826)    But my fame as yet slumbers in the marble quarries of Carrara; the  waste-paper laurel with which they have bedecked my brow has not yet  spread its perfume through the wide world, and the green-veiled English  ladies, when they come to Duesseldorf as yet leave the celebrated house  unvisited, and go directly to the market-place and there gaze on the  colossal black equestrian statue which stands in its midst. This is  supposed to represent the Prince Elector, Jan Wilhelm. He wears black  armor and a long wig hanging down his back. When a boy, I heard the  legend that the artist who made this statue became aware, to his  horror, while it was being cast, that he had not metal enough to fill  the mold, and then all the citizens of the town came running with all  their silver spoons, and threw them in to make up the deficiency; and I  often stood for hours before the statue wondering how many spoons were  concealed in it, and how many apple-tarts the silver would buy.  Apple-tarts were then my passion--now it is love, truth, liberty, and  crab-soup--and not far from the statue of the Prince Elector, at the  theatre corner, generally stood a curiously constructed bow-legged  fellow with a white apron, and a basket girt around him full of  delightfully steaming apple-tarts, whose praises he well knew how to  call out in an irresistible high treble voice, \"Here you are! hot  apple-tarts! just from the oven--smelling deliciously!\" Truly, whenever  in my later years the Evil One sought to get the better of me, he always  spoke in just such an enticing high treble voice, and I should certainly  have never remained twelve full hours with the Signora Giulietta, if she  had not thrilled me with her sweet perfumed apple-tart tones. And, in  fact, the apple-tarts would never have so sorely tempted me if the  crooked Hermann had not covered them up so mysteriously with his white  apron; and it is aprons, you know, which--but I wander from the subject.  I was speaking of the equestrian statue which has so many silver spoons  in it, and no soup, and which represents the Prince Elector, Jan  Wilhelm.    He was a brave gentleman, 'tis reported, a lover of art and handy  therein himself. He founded the picture-gallery in Duesseldorf; and in  the observatory there, they still show us an extremely artistic piece of  work, consisting of one wooden cup within another which he himself had  carved in his leisure hours, of which latter he had every day  four-and-twenty.    [Illustration: JOHANN WILHELM MONUMENT, DUeSSELDORF]    In those days princes were not the harassed creatures they now are.  Their crowns grew firmly on their heads, and at night they drew  nightcaps over them besides and slept in peace, and their people  slumbered calmly at their feet; and when they awoke in the morning they  said, \"Good morning, father!\" and the princes replied, \"Good morning,  dear children!\"    But there came a sudden change over all this, for one morning when we  awoke in Duesseldorf and wanted to say, \"Good morning, father!\" the  father had traveled away, and in the whole"]]]
