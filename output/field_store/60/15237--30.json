[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#20)"],[1," Alfred found that the Danish camp was in a very unguarded and careless  condition. The name of the commander, or king, was Guthrum.[1] Alfred,  while playing in his presence, studied his character, and it is (not)  improbable that the very extraordinary course which he afterward  pursued in respect to Guthrum may have been caused, in a great degree,  by the opportunity he now enjoyed of domestic access to him and  of obtaining a near and intimate view of his social and personal  character. Guthrum treated the supposed harper with great kindness. He  was much pleased both with his singing and his songs, being attracted,  too, probably, in some degree, by a certain mysterious interest which  the humble stranger must have inspired; for Alfred possessed personal  and intellectual traits of character which could not but have given to  his conversation and his manners a certain charm, notwithstanding all  his efforts to disguise or conceal them.    However this may be, Guthrum gave Alfred a very friendly reception,  and the hour of social intercourse and enjoyment which the general  and the ballad-singer spent together was only a precursor of the more  solid and honest friendship which afterward subsisted between them as  allied sovereigns.    Alfred had one person with him, whom he had brought from Ethelney--a  sort of attendant--to help him carry his harp, and to be a companion  for him on the way. He would have needed such a companion even if he  had been only what he seemed; but for a spy, going in disguise into  the camp of such ferocious enemies as the Danes, it would seem  absolutely indispensable that he should have the support and sympathy  of a friend.    Alfred, after finishing his examination of the camp of Guthrum, and  forming secretly, in his own mind, his plans for attacking it, moved  leisurely away, taking his harp and his attendant with him, as if  going on in search of some new place to practice his profession. As  soon as he was out of the reach of observation, he made a circuit and  returned in safety to Ethelney. The season was now spring, and every  thing favored the commencement of his enterprise.    His first measure was to send out some trusty messengers into all the  neighboring counties, to visit and confer with his friends at their  various castles and strong-holds. These messengers were to announce to  such Saxon leaders as they should find that Alfred was still alive,  and that he was preparing to take the field against the Danes again;  and were to invite them to assemble at a certain place appointed, in  a forest, with as many followers as they could bring, that the  king might there complete the organization of an army, and hold  consultation with them to mature their plans.    The wood on the borders of which they were to meet was an extensive  forest of willows, fifteen miles long and six broad. It was known by  the name of Selwood Forest. There was a celebrated place called the  Stone of Egbert, where the meeting was to be held. Each chieftain whom  the messengers should visit was to be invited to come to the Stone of  Egbert at the appointed day, with as many armed men, and yet in  as secret and noiseless a manner as possible, so as thus, while  concentrating all their forces in preparation for their intended  attack, to avoid every thing which would tend to put Guthrum on his  guard.    The messengers found the Saxon chieftains very ready to enter into  Alfred's plans. They were rejoiced to hear, as some of them did now  for the first time hear, that he was alive, and that the spirit and  energy of his former character were about to be exhibited again. Every  thing, in fact, conspired to favor the enterprise. The long and gloomy  months of winter were past, and the opening spring brought with it,  as usual, excitement and readiness for action. The tidings of Odun's  victory over Hubba, and the capture of the sacred raven, which had  spread every where, had awakened a general enthusiasm, and a desire  on the part of all the Saxon chieftains and soldiers to try their  strength once more with their ancient enemies.    Accordingly, those to whom the secret was intrusted eagerly accepted  the invitation, or, perhaps, as it should rather be expressed, obeyed  the summons which Alfred sent them. They marshaled their forces  without any delay, and repaired to the appointed place in Selwood  Forest. Alfred was ready to meet them there. Two days were occupied  with the arrivals of the different parties, and in the mutual  congratulations and rejoicings. Growing more bold as their sense of  strength increased with their increasing numbers, and with the ardor  and enthusiasm which their mutual influence on each other inspired,  they spent the intervals of their consultations in festivities and  rejoicings, celebrating the occasion with games and martial music. The  forest resounded with the blasts of horns, the sound of the trumpets,  the clash of arms, and the shouts of joy and congratulation, which all  the efforts of the more prudent and cautious could not repress.    In the mean time, Guthrum remained in his encampment at Edendune. This  seems to have been the principal concentration of the forces of the  Danes which were marshaled for military service; and yet there were  large numbers of the people, disbanded soldiers, or non-combatants,  who had come over in the train of the armies, that had taken  possession of the lands which they had conquered, and had settled upon  them for cultivation, as if to make them their permanent home. These  intruders were scattered in larger or smaller bodies in various parts  of the kingdom, the Saxon inhabitants being prevented from driving  them away by the influence and power of the armies, which still kept  possession of the field, and preserved their military organization  complete, ready for action at any time whenever any organized Saxon  force should appear.    Guthrum, as we have said, headed the largest of these armies. He was  aware of the increasing excitement that was spreading among the Saxon  population, and he even heard rumors of the movements which the bodies  of Saxons made, in going under their several chieftains to Selwood  Forest. He expected that some important movement was about to occur,  but he had no idea that preparations so extended, and for so decisive  a demonstration, were so far advanced. He remained, therefore, at his  camp at Edendune, gradually completing his arrangements for his summer  campaign, but making no preparations for resisting any sudden or  violent attack.    When all was ready, Alfred put himself at the head of the forces which  had collected at the Egbert Stone, or, as it is quaintly spelled in  some of the old accounts, Ecgbyrth-stan. There is a place called  Brixstan in that vicinity now, which may possibly be the same name  modified and abridged by the lapse of time. Alfred moved forward  toward Guthrum's camp. He went only a part of the way the first day,  intending to finish the march by getting into the immediate vicinity  of the enemy on the morrow. He succeeded in accomplishing this object,  and encamped the next night at a place called AEcglea,[2] on an  eminence from which he could reconnoiter, from a great distance, the  position of the army.    That night, as he was sleeping in his tent, he had a remarkable dream.  He dreamed that his relative, St. Neot, who has been already mentioned  as the chaplain or priest who reproved him so severely for his sins in  the early part of his reign, appeared to him. The apparition bid him  not fear the immense army of pagans whom he was going to encounter  on the morrow. God, he said, had accepted his penitence, and was now  about to take him under his special protection. The calamities which  had befallen him were sent in judgment to punish the pride and  arrogance which he had manifested in the early part of his reign; but  his faults had been expiated by the sufferings he had endured, and by  the penitence and the piety which they had been the means of awakening  in his heart; and now he might go forward into the battle without  fear, as God was about to give him the victory over all his enemies.    The king related his dream the next morning to his army. The  enthusiasm and ardor which the chieftains and the men had felt before  were very much increased by this assurance of success. They broke up  their encampment, therefore, and commenced the march, which was to  bring them, before many hours, into the presence of the enemy, with  great alacrity and eager expectations of success.    [Footnote 1: Spelled sometimes Godrun, Gutrum, Gythram, and in various  other ways.]    [Footnote 2: Some think that this place is the modern Leigh; others,  that it was Highley; either of which names might have been deduced  from AEcglea.]          CHAPTER X.    THE VICTORY OVER THE DANES.      Encouraged by his dream, and animated by the number and the elation  of his followers, Alfred led his army onward toward the part of the  country where the camp of the enemy lay. He intended to surprise them;  and, although Guthrum had heard vague rumors that some great Saxon  movement was in train, he viewed the sudden appearance of this large  and well-organized army with amazement.    He had possession of the hill near Edendune, which has been already  described. He had established his head-quarters here, and made his  strongest fortifications on the summit of the eminence. The main body  of his forces were, however, encamped upon the plain, over which they  extended, in vast numbers, far and wide. Alfred halted his men to  change the order of march into the order of battle. Here he made an  address to his men. As no time was to be lost, he spoke but a few  words. He reminded them that they were to contend, that day, to rescue  themselves and their country from the intolerable oppression of a  horde of pagan idolaters; that God was on their side, and had promised  them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#20)"],[1,"sident.    The texts of the Tripitaka were collected and the Council \"composed  100,000 stanzas of Upadesa Sastras explanatory of the canonical  sutras, 100,000 stanzas of Vinaya-vibhasha Sastras explanatory of the  Vinaya and 100,000 of Abhidharma-vibhasha Sastras explanatory of the  Abhidharma. For this exposition of the Tripitaka all learning from  remote antiquity was thoroughly examined; the general sense and the  terse language (of the Buddhist scriptures) was again and again made  clear and distinct, and learning was widely diffused for the  safe-guiding of disciples. King Kanishka caused the treatises when  finished to be written out on copper plates and enclosed these in  stone boxes which he deposited in a tope made for the purpose. He then  ordered spirits to keep and guard the texts and not to allow any to be  taken out of the country by heretics; those who wished to study them  could do so in the country. When leaving to return to his own country,  Kanishka renewed Asoka's gift of all Kashmir to the Buddhist  Church.\"[194]    Paramartha (499-569 A.D.) in his _Life of Vasubandhu_[195] gives an  account of a council generally considered to be the same as that  described by Hsuean Chuang, though the differences in the two versions  are considerable. He says that about five hundred years[196] after the  Buddha's death (_i.e._ between 87 B.C. and 13 A.D. if the Buddha died  487 B.C.) an Indian Arhat called Katyayani-putra, who was a monk of  the Sarvastivadin school, went to Kipin or Kashmir. There with 500  other Arhats and 500 Bodhisattvas he collected the Abhidharma of the  Sarvastivadins and arranged it in eight books called Ka-lan-ta  (Sanskrit _Grantha_) or Kan-tu (Pali _Gantho_). This compilation was  also called Jnana-prasthana. He then made a proclamation inviting all  who had heard the Buddha preach to communicate what they remembered.  Many spirits responded and contributed their reminiscences which were  examined by the Council and, when they did not contradict the sutras  and the Vinaya, were accepted, but otherwise were rejected. The  selected pieces were grouped according to their subject-matter. Those  about wisdom formed the Prajna Grantha, and those about meditation the  Dhyana Grantha and so on. After finishing the eight books they  proceeded to the composition of a commentary or Vibhasha and invited  the assistance of Asvaghosha. When he came to Kashmir, Katyayani-putra  expounded the eight books to him and Asvaghosha put them into literary  form. At the end of twelve years the composition of the commentary was  finished. It consisted of 1,000,000 verses.... Katyayani-putra set up  a stone inscribed with this proclamation. \"Those who hereafter learn  this law must not go out of Kashmir. No sentence of the eight books,  or of the Vibhasha must pass out of the land, lest other schools or  the Mahayana should corrupt the true law.\" This proclamation was  reported to the king who approved it. The sages of Kashmir had power  over demons and set them to guard the entrance to the country, but we  are told that anyone desirous of learning the law could come to  Kashmir and was in no way interrupted.    There follows a story telling how, despite this prohibition, a native  of Ayodhya succeeded in learning the law in Kashmir and subsequently  teaching it in his native land. Paramartha's account seems  exaggerated, whereas the prohibition described by Hsuean Chuang is  intelligible. It was forbidden to take the official copies of the law  out of Kashmir, lest heretics should tamper with them.    Taranatha[197] gives a singularly confused account of the meeting,  which he expressly calls the third council, but makes some important  statements about it. He says that it put an end to the dissensions  which had been distracting the Buddhist Church _for nearly a century_  and that it recognized all the eighteen sects as holding the true  doctrine: that it put the Vinaya in writing as well as such parts of  the Sutra-pitaka and Abhidharma as were still unwritten and corrected  those which already existed as written texts: that all kinds of  Mahayanist writings appeared at this time but that the Sravakas raised  no opposition.    It is hard to say how much history can be extracted from these vague  and discrepant stories. They seem to refer to one assembly regarded  (at least in Tibet) as the third council of the Church and held under  Kanishka four or five hundred years[198] after the Buddha's death. As  to what happened at the council tradition seems to justify the  following deductions, though as the tradition is certainly jumbled it  may also be incorrect in details.    (_a_) The council is recognized only by the northern Church and is  unknown to the Churches of Ceylon, Burma and Siam. It seems to have  regarded Kashmir as sacred land outside which the true doctrine was  exposed to danger. (_b_) But it was not a specially Mahayanist meeting  but rather a conference of peace and compromise. Taranatha says this  clearly: in Hsuean Chuang's account an assembly of Arhats (which at  this time must have meant Hinayanists) elect a president who was not  an Arhat and according to Paramartha the assembly consisted of 500  Arhats and 500 Bodhisattvas who were convened by a leader of the  Sarvastivadin school and ended by requesting Asvaghosha to revise  their work. (_c_) The literary result of the council was the  composition of commentaries on the three Pitakas. One of these, the  Abhidharma-mahavibhasha-sastra, translated into Chinese in 437-9 and  still extant, is said to be a work of encyclopaedic character, hardly a  commentary in the strict sense. Paramartha perhaps made a confusion in  saying that the Jnana-prasthana itself was composed at the council.  The traditions indicate that the council to some extent sifted and  revised the Tripitaka and perhaps it accepted the seven Abhidharma  books of the Sarvastivadins.[199] But it is not stated or implied that  it composed or sanctioned Mahayanist books. Taranatha merely says that  such books appeared at this time and that the Hinayanists raised no  active objection.    But if the above is the gist of the traditions, the position described  is not clear. The council is recognized by Mahayanists yet it appears  to have resulted in the composition of a Sarvastivadin treatise, and  the tradition connecting the Sarvastivadins with the council is not  likely to be wrong, for they are recognized in the inscription on  Kanishka's casket, and Gandhara and Kashmir were their headquarters.  The decisions of councils are often politic rather than logical and it  may be that the doctors summoned by Kanishka, while compiling  Sarvastivadin treatises, admitted the principle that there is more  than one vehicle which can take mankind to salvation. Perhaps some  compromise based on geography was arranged, such as that Kashmir  should be left to the Sarvastivadin school which had long flourished  there, but that no opposition should be offered to the Mahayanists  elsewhere.    The relations of the Sarvastivadins to Mahayanism are exceedingly  difficult to define and there are hardly sufficient materials for a  connected account of this once important sect, but I will state some  facts about it which seem certain.    It is ancient, for the Kathavatthu alludes to its doctrines.[200] It  flourished in Gandhara, Kashmir and Central Asia, and Kanishka's  casket shows that he patronized it.[201] But it appears to have been  hardly known in Ceylon or Southern India. It was the principal  northern form of Hinayanism, just as the Theravada was the southern  form. I-Ching however says that it prevailed in the Malay Archipelago.    Its doctrines, so far as known, were Hinayanist but it was  distinguished from cognate schools by holding that the external world  can be said to exist and is not merely a continual process of  becoming. It had its own version of the Abhidharma and of the Vinaya.  In the time of Fa-Hsien the latter was still preserved orally and was  not written. The adherents of this school were also called  Vaibhashikas, and Vibhasha was a name given to their exegetical  literature.    But the association of the Sarvastivadins with Mahayanists is clear  from the council of Kanishka onwards. Many eminent Buddhists began by  being Sarvastivadins and became Mahayanists, their earlier belief  being regarded as preliminary rather than erroneous. Hsuean Chuang  translated the Sarvastivadin scriptures in his old age and I-Ching  belonged to the Mulasarvastivadin school;[202] yet both authors write  as if they were devout Mahayanists. The Tibetan Church is generally  regarded as an extreme form of Mahayanism but its Vinaya is that of  the Sarvastivadins.    Though the Sarvastivadins can hardly have accepted idealist  metaphysics, yet the evidence of art and their own version of the  Vinaya make it probable that they tolerated a moderate amount of  mythology, and the Mahayanists, who like all philosophers were obliged  to admit the provisional validity of the external world, may also have  admitted their analysis of the same as provisionally valid. The  strength of the Hinayanist schools lay in the Vinaya. The Mahayanists  showed a tendency to replace it by legends and vague if noble  aspirations. But a code of discipline was necessary for large  monasteries and the code of the Sarvastivadins enjoyed general esteem  in Central Asia and China.    Three stages in the history of Indian Buddhism are marked by the names  of Asvaghosha, Nagarjuna and the two brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu.  It would be easier to give a precise description of its development if  we were sure which of the works ascribed to these worthies are  authentic, but it seems that Asvaghosha represents an ornate and  transitional phase of the older schools leading to Mahayanism, whereas  Nagarjuna is connected with the Prajna-paramita and the nihilistic  philosophy described in the preceding chapter."]]]
