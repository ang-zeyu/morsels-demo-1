He continues:    \"As the struggle swayed backward and forward through wood and hamlet,  the fighting assumed a most confused and desperate character. The units  became inextricably mixed, and in many cases, in order to strengthen  some threatened point or to fill a gap in the line, the officers had to  collect and throw into the fight what men they could, regardless of the  units to which they belonged. Our casualties have been severe; but we  have been fighting a battle, and a battle implies casualties, and, heavy  as they have been, it must be remembered that they have not been  suffered in vain.    \"The duty of the French, Belgians, and British in the western theatre of  operations has been to act as a containing force; in other words, to  hold on to and to keep occupied as many of the enemy as possible while  the Russians were attacking in the east. In this we have succeeded in  playing our part, and by our resistance have contributed materially  toward the success of the campaign. Moreover, our losses have not  impaired our fighting efficiency. The troops have required only a slight  respite in order to be able to continue the action with as much  determination as ever. They are physically fit and well fed and have  suffered merely from the fatigue which is inseparable from a protracted  struggle such as they have been through. The severest handling by the  enemy has never had more than a temporary effect on their spirits,  which they have soon recovered, owing to the years of discipline and  training to which the officers and men have been accustomed.    \"The value of such preparation is as noticeable on the side of the enemy  as on our own. The phenomenal losses suffered by the Germans' new  formations have been remarked, and they were in part due to their lack  of training. Moreover, though at the first onset these formations  advanced to the attack as gravely as their active corps, they have not  by any means, shown the same recuperative powers. The Twenty-seventh  Corps, for instance, which is a new formation composed principally of  men with from only seven to twelve weeks' training, has not yet  recovered from its first encounter with the British infantry around  Becelaere, to the northeast of Ypres, a month ago. On the other hand,  the Guards Corps, in spite of having suffered severely in Belgium, of  having been thrown headlong across the Oise River at Guise and of having  lost large numbers on the plains of Compiegne and on the banks of the  Aisne River, advanced against Ypres on the 11th of November as bravely  as they did on the 20th of August.\"    The Allies, continues Col. Swinton, have made great sacrifices to defend  against tremendous odds a line that could only be maintained by making  these sacrifices; but the fact that the situation has been relieved is  no reason for assuming that the enemy has abandoned his intention of  pressing through to the sea. The writer points out that the Germans  continue to attack with great courage, but little abated by failure,  and, while they have not succeeded in gaining the Straits of Dover, they  have been enabled to consolidate their position on the western front and  retain all but a small portion of Belgium.    \"As well as they have fought, however,\" continues the narrative, \"it is  doubtful if their achievements are commensurate with their losses, which  recently have been largely due to a lack of training and a comparative  lack of discipline of the improvised units they put in the field.\"    Col. Swinton concludes with the statement that, as the war is going to  be one of exhaustion, after the regular armies of the belligerents have  done their work it will be upon the raw material of the countries  concerned that final success will depend.          XIII.    *The Lull in November.*    [Dated Nov. 29.]      General inactivity is recorded along the English front, with the Germans  pressing the attack in one quarter against the Indian troops, who have  been extending their trenches in an endeavor to get in close quarters  with the enemy. There has been some shelling of the rear of our front  line south of the Lys, but this form of annoyance diminishes daily along  the whole front. Sniping, however, is carried on almost incessantly.  There seems to be little doubt that the Germans are employing civilians,  either willingly or unwillingly, to dig trenches; some civilians have  been seen and shot while engaged in this work.    While it is necessary to accept the evidence of all prisoners with  caution, there is a change in the views expressed by some officers  captured recently which appears to be genuine. They admit the failure of  the German strategy and profess to take a gloomy view of the future. At  the same time it must be confessed that as yet there is no sign that  their view is that generally held by the enemy, nor has there been any  definite indication of a lack of morale among the German troops.    The highways of Northern France are crowded with men responding to the  various mobilization orders issued by the French Government.    Thousands of such troops were encountered in the course of a short  automobile trip. The strange procession includes a curious mixture of  types. A considerable proportion of these new drafts are composed of  middle-aged men of good physique and likely young men from the  countryside.    The change within the last few days of what may be termed the atmosphere  of the battlefield has been marked. The noise of the cannonading has now  decreased to such an extent that for hours at a time nothing is heard  but the infrequent boom of one of the heavy guns of the Allies, the  occasional rattle of machine guns, and the intermittent fire of snipers  on either side. So far as the use of explosives is concerned, the  greatest activity is found in local attacks with hand grenades and  short-range howitzers. The enemy has practically ceased his efforts to  break through the line by assaults, and he is now devoting his energies  to the same type of siege operations which have been familiar to the  Allies since the beginning of the battle of the Aisne.    Subterranean life is the general rule in the neighborhood of the firing  line. Even those men not actually engaged in fighting live in  underground quarters. Some of these quarters, called \"funk-holes\" are  quite elaborate and comfortable and contain many conveniences not found  in the trenches on the firing line. They communicate with the firing  line by zigzag approach trenches which make enfilading impossible.    Attacks are made on the firing line trenches by blind saps, which are  constructed by a special earth borer. When this secret tunnel reaches  the enemy's trench, an assault is delivered amid a shower of hand  grenades. The stormers endeavor to burst their way through the opening  and then try to work along the trench. Machine guns are quickly brought  up to repel a counter attack. Most of this fighting takes place at such  close range that the guns on either side cannot be fired at the enemy's  infantry without great risk of hitting their own men. Bombs have come to  take the place of artillery, and they are being used in enormous  quantities.    The short-range howitzers are of three types, and those used by the  Germans have come to be termed the \"Jack Johnson\" of close attack. The  smaller bombs and grenades thrown by hand, although local in action, are  very unpleasant, particularly between the inclosed space of a trench.  These grenades are thrown continuously by both sides, and every trench  assault is first preceded and then accompanied by showers of these  murderous missiles. This kind of fighting is very deadly, and owing to  the difficulty of observation it is at times somewhat blind. This  difficulty has in a measure been decreased, however, by the use of the  hyperscope, an instrument which works very much like the periscope on a  submarine. It permits an observer to look out over the top of a parapet  without raising his head above the protection of the trench.          *THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY.*    By EDWARD NEVILLE VOSE.      THE old year dies 'mid gloom and woe--    The saddest year since Christ was born--  And those who battle in the snow    All anxious-eyed look for the morn--  The morn when wars shall be no more,    The morn when Might shall cease to reign,  When hushed shall be the cannons' roar    And Peace shall rule the earth again.    As we from far survey the fray    And strive to succor those who fall,  Let each give thanks that not today    To us the clarion bugles call--  That not today to us 'tis said:    \"Bow down the knee, or pay the cost  Till all ye loved are maimed or dead,    Till all ye had is wrecked and lost.\"    Should that grim summons to us come    God grant we'd all play heroes' parts,  And bravely fight for land and home    While red blood flows in loyal hearts.  But now a duty nobler far    Has come to us in this great day--  We are the nations' guiding star,    They look to us to lead the way.    They look to us to lead the way    To liberty for all the world,  The dawning of that better day    When war's torn banners shall be furled--  The day when men of every race    Their right divine shall clearly see  To rule themselves by their own grace,    Forever and forever free.          *\"Human Documents\" of Battle*    *By Men Who Saw or Took Part./*        _Written in the hurry and confusion of battle, and without the      opportunity at hand to check up the impressions given, it is of      course likely that these dispatches from special correspondents may      contain many things which history will correct.

Here, as has been previously pointed out, it is best to  employ leather splints, so that a maximum degree of rigidity with a  minimum of distress and inconvenience to the patient will result. The  leg must be bandaged from the hoof upward, making use of a sufficient  amount of cotton to ensure against pressure-necrosis. The leather  splints are placed mesially and laterally and, of course, need to extend  as high as the proximal end of the radius. Subjects must be kept in  slings until union of bones has become established, and as a rule there  will then exist marked ankylosis.    There is no particular difference in the handling of carpal luxation and  dislocation of other bones. Where ligaments have not been destroyed to  the extent that reduction is of no practical use, the parts are kept  immobilized, if thought necessary. Later, vesication of the whole  pericarpal region is done and the subject allowed exercise at will.      Carpitis.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Inflammation of the carpus is caused by  contusions, such as are occasioned in falling, by kicks by striking the  carpus against objects in jumping and sometimes by striking it against  the manger in pawing. The condition is of rather frequent occurrence.    Symptomatology.--Evident symptoms of inflammation in carpitis are  always present--hyperthermia, supersensitiveness and swelling. Also,  there exists lameness which is characterized by an apparent inability to  flex the leg, and there is circumduction of the leg as it is advanced  because in this way little if any flexion of the carpus (which increases  pain) is necessary.    Depending upon the nature of the cause, there occurs a marked difference  in the character and amount of swelling.    [Illustration: Fig. 11--Pericarpal inflammation and enlargement due to  injury.]    Naturally, when much extravasation of serum and blood takes place, there  is occasioned a fluctuating swelling which is usually less painful to  the subject upon manipulation than is a dense inflammatory change  without marked extravasation.    In acute carpitis, there is present, then, a very painful condition  which involves the articulation, causing marked lameness, disturbance of  appetite and some elevation of temperature.    Chronic cases do not occasion serious pain or constitutional  disturbances, but do interfere with locomotion in direct proportion to  the existing articular inflammation and periarticular hypertrophy of  ligamentous and tendinous structures.    Treatment.--If possible, keep the subject absolutely quiet, employing  the sling if necessary. During the first stages of inflammation, the  application of ice packs to the affected parts, is of marked benefit.  At the end of forty-eight hours, hot applications may be used and this  treatment continued throughout several days. Anodyne liniments are of  service and should be employed throughout the acute stage of  inflammation during intervals between the hydrotherapeutic treatments.    As inflammation subsides, a counterirritating application such as a  suitable liniment and later blistering or line-firing is helpful in  stimulating resolution.    [Illustration: Fig. 12--Hygromatous condition of the right carpus, also  distension of sheaths of extensor tendons of both fore legs.]      Open Carpal Joint.    Anatomy.--The carpal bones as they articulate with one another and  with the radius and metacarpal bones, as classed by anatomists, form  three distinct articular parts of the joint as a whole and are known as  radiocarpal, intercarpal and carpometacarpal. These three pairs of  articulating surfaces are all enclosed within one capsular ligament. On  the anterior face of the bones, the capsular ligament is attached to the  carpal bones in such manner that an imperfect partitioning of the three  joint compartments is formed. Posteriorly, the capsule is very heavy and  forms a sort of padding over the irregular surfaces of the bones, and  also its reflexions constitute the sheaths of the flexor tendons. The  anterior portion of the capsular ligament forms sheaths for the extensor  tendons, and both portions of the joint have an attachment around the  distal end of the radius and another at the proximal end of the  metacarpal bones.    [Illustration: Fig. 13--Carpal exostosis in aged horse.]    Etiology and Occurrence.--Puncture wounds of any kind may serve to  perforate the joint capsule and such traumatisms are occasioned by  falls, kicks and in various ways in runaway accidents, and open carpal  joint may follow.    Symptomatology.--The pathognomonic symptoms of the existence of an  open joint is the exposure to view of articular surfaces of bones or  noting the escape of synovia from the joint capsule. As has been  previously referred to, there always exists a peculiar suspension of  carpal flexion in all cases of carpitis.    Non-infective wounds which may cause open joint are not necessarily  productive of an active carpitis--a synovitis may be the extent of the  disturbance. Unlike synovitis, which may characterize a non-infectious  penetrative wound of the capsular ligament, septic arthritis which may  supervene is a very painful inflammatory disturbance. It is  characterized by all of the symptoms which attend the case of open joint  and synovitis plus the obvious manifestation of great pain. There is an  elevation of temperature of from two to five degrees above normal;  circulation is accelerated; the pulse is bounding; respiration is  hurried; there is an expression of pain as indicated by the physiognomy;  and because of rapid erosive changes of cartilages which take place,  there is soon so much of the articulation destroyed that death is  inevitable. Death is usually due to generalization of the arthritic  infection.    [Illustration: Fig. 14--Exostosis of carpus resultant from carpitis.]    [Illustration: Fig. 15--Distal end of radius. Illustrating the effects  of chronic carpitis.]    In the meanwhile, if the character of the infectious material is not so  virulent, the disease will take on a slower course and the subject may  experience laminitis from supporting weight upon the sound member, or  because of continued recumbency, decubital gangrene and emaciation  sometimes cause death. If the subject does not soon succumb, it is  compelled to undergo days or even weeks of unnecessary suffering, and  too often in such cases, it is later deemed advisable to destroy the  animal because of the cost of continuing treatment until the horse is  serviceable. Therefore, it is evident that when such joints as the  carpus or tarsus are open and infection exists, if they are not promptly  treated and the infectious process checked, it is neither humane nor  practical to prolong treatment.    Distinction must be made between the different joints when infected as  the condition is much more serious in some cases than in others. All  things considered, perhaps open joints rank, with respect to being  serious cases as follows: elbow, navicular, stifle, tarsus, carpus,  fetlock and pastern. This, of course, is restricted to articulations of  the locomotory apparatus.    Treatment.--Preliminary care in the treatment of an open carpal joint,  is the same as has been described in this condition as it affects the  scapulohumeral articulation described on page 65. Likewise the further  treatment of such cases is along the same lines except that where it is  possible, the parts are kept covered with cotton and bandages. However,  in some cases, animals have been successfully treated without bandaging  and by keeping the patient in a standing position and on pillar reins  until recovery resulted. Such cases were of the non-infectious type and  recovery was possible within three or four weeks. Further, the condition  is not sufficiently painful in such instances as to prevent the subjects  bearing weight with the affected member; hence, no danger of resulting  laminitis is incurred. And finally, where bandages are not employed, the  frequent use of antiseptic dusting powders is substituted for cotton as  a protector.    When bandaged, such wounds need dressing more or less frequently, as  individual instances demand. The purulent infective inflammation of a  carpal joint will require daily dressing; whereas, in other cases  (non-infective), semi-weekly change of bandages is sufficient. Equal  parts of boric acid and exsiccated alum constitute a suitable  combination for the treatment of these cases, and this powder should be  liberally employed. Tincture of iodin may be injected into the joint  capsule where there is provision for its ready evacuation, as  conditions seem to require. Daily injections for three, four or five  days, are not harmful and will control infection in many instances.      Thecitis and Bursitis.    Etiology and Occurrence.--The thecae and bursae of the leg are several  in number. In the carpal region, the flexors of the phalanges are  contained together in the carpal sheath, and this is the principal theca  in the carpal region. Each of the tendons is provided with synovial  sheaths which are subject to inflammation and occasionally synovitis and  distension of these synovial sheaths occur.    Because of faulty conformation, some animals are subject to inflammation  of these sheaths, and all forms of strenuous work which taxes the  tendons greatly is apt to result in synovitis. Direct injury such as  blows may be the cause of synovial distension of thecae and the  affection is to be seen in all horses that have done much fast work on  hard road surfaces or pavements.    The usual case as it occurs in practice is a non-infective synovitis,  but where puncture wounds cause the trouble, an infectious inflammation  obtains.    Symptomatology.--No trouble is experienced in diagnosing distension of  tendon sheaths, for the affection is very palpable. During"]]]
