Psalm 77:2. Second Part.  Comfort derived from ancient providences; or,  Israel delivered from Egypt, and brought to Canaan.    1 \"How awful is thy chastening rod!\"  (May thine own children say)  \"The great, the wise, the dreadful God!  \"How holy is his way!\"    2 I'll meditate his works of old;  The King that reigns above;  I'll hear his ancient wonders told,  And learn to trust his love.    3 Long did the house of Joseph lie  With Egypt's yoke opprest:  Long he delay'd to hear their cry,  Nor gave his people rest.    4 The sons of good old Jacob seem'd  Abandon'd to their foes;  But his almighty arm redeem'd  The nation that he chose.    5 Israel, his people, and his sheep,  Must follow where he calls;  He bid them venture thro' the deep,  And made the waves their walls.    6 The waters saw thee, mighty God!  The waters saw thee come;  Backward they fled, and frighted stood,  To make thine armies room.    7 Strange was thy journey thro' the sea,  Thy footsteps, Lord, unknown,  Terrors attend the wondrous way  That brings thy mercies down.    8 [Thy voice with terror in the sound  Thro' clouds and darkness broke;  All heaven in lightning shone around,  And earth with thunder shook.    9 Thine arrows thro' the skies were hurl'd;  How glorious is the Lord!  Surprise and trembling seiz'd the world,  And his own saints ador'd.    10 He gave them water from the rock;  And safe by Moses' hand  Thro' a dry desert led his flock  Home to the promis'd land.]      Psalm 78:1. First Part.  Providence of God recorded; or, Pious  education and instruction of children.    1 Let children hear the mighty deeds,  Which God perform'd of old,  Which in our younger years we saw,  And which our fathers told.    2 He bids us make his glories known,  His works of power and grace;  And we'll convey his wonders down  Thro' every rising race.    3 Our lips shall tell them to our Sons,  And they again to theirs,  That generations yet unborn  May teach them to their heirs.    4 Thus shall they learn in God alone  Their hope securely stands,  That they may ne'er forget his works,  But practise his commands.      Psalm 78:2. Second Part.  Israel's rebellion and punishment; or, The  sins and chastisements of God's people.    1 What a stiff rebellious house  Was Jacob's ancient race!  False to their own most solemn vows,  And to their Maker's grace.    2 They broke the covenant of his love,  And did his laws despise,  Forgot the works he wrought to prove  His power before their eyes.    3 They saw the plagues on Egypt light,  From his revenging hand:  What dreadful tokens of his might  Spread o'er the stubborn land!    4 They saw him cleave the mighty sea,  And march'd in safety thro',  With watery walls to guard their way,  Till they had 'scap'd the foe.    5 A wondrous pillar mark'd the road,  Compos'd of shade and light;  By day it prov'd a sheltering cloud,  A leading fire by night.    6 He from the rock their thirst supply'd;  The gushing waters fell,  And ran in rivers by their side,  A constant miracle.    7 Yet they provok'd the Lord most high,  And dar'd distrust his hand;  \"Can he with bread our host supply  \"Amidst this desert land?\"    8 The Lord with indignation heard,  And caus'd his wrath to flame  His terrors ever stand prepar'd  To vindicate his Name.      Psalm 78:3. Third Part.  The punishment of luxury and intemperance;  or, Chastisement and salvation.    1 When Israel sins, the Lord reproves,  And fills their hearts with dread;  Yet he forgives the men he loves,  And sends them heavenly bread.    2 He fed them with a liberal hand,  And made his treasures known;  He gave the midnight clouds command  To pour provision down.    3 The manna, like a morning shower,  Lay thick around their feet;  The corn of heaven, so light, so pure,  As tho' 'twere angels' meat.    4 But they in murmuring language said,  \"Manna is all our feast;  \"We loathe this light, this airy bread;  \"We must have flesh to taste.\"    5 \"Ye shall have flesh to please your lust;\"  The Lord in wrath reply'd,  And sent them quails like sand or dust,  Heap'd up from side to side.    6 He gave them all their own desire;  And greedy as they fed,  His vengeance burnt with secret fire,  And smote the rebels dead.    7 When some were slain, the rest return'd,  And sought the Lord with tears;  Under the rod they fear'd and mourn'd,  But soon forgot their fears.    8 Oft he chastis'd and still forgave,  Till by his gracious hand  The nation he resolv'd to save,  Possess'd the promis'd land.      Psalm 78:4. 32 &c. Fourth Part.  Backsliding and forgiveness; or,  Sin punished, and saints saved.    1 Great God, how oft did Israel prove  By turns thine anger and thy love!  There in a glass our hearts may see  How fickle and how false they be.    2 How soon the faithless Jews forgot  The dreadful wonders God had wrought!  Then they provoke him to his face,  Nor fear his power, nor trust his grace.    3 The Lord consum'd their years in pain,  And made their travels long and vain;  A tedious march thro' unknown ways  Wore out their strength and spent their days.    4 Oft when they saw their brethren slain,  They mourn'd and sought the Lord again;  Call'd him the Rock of their abode,  Their high Redeemer and their God.    5 Their prayers and vows before him rise  As flattering words or solemn lies,  While their rebellious tempers prove  False to his covenant and his love.    6 Yet did his sovereign grace forgive  The men who not deserv'd to live;  His anger oft away he turn'd,  Or else with gentle flame it burn'd.    7 He saw their flesh was weak and frail,  He saw temptation still prevail  The God of Abraham lov'd them still,  And led them to his holy hill.      Psalm 80.  The church's prayer under affliction;  or, The vineyard of God wasted.    1 Great Shepherd of thine Israel,  Who didst between the cherubs dwell,  And led the tribes, thy chosen sheep,  Safe thro' the desert and the deep.    2 Thy church is in the desert now,  Shine from on high and guide us thro';  Turn us to thee, thy love restore,  We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more.    3 Great God, whom heavenly hosts obey,  How long shall we lament and pray,  And wait in vain thy kind return?  How long shall thy fierce anger burn?    4 Instead of wine and cheerful bread,  Thy saints with their own tears are fed;  Turn us to thee, thy love restore,  We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more.    PAUSE I.    5 Hast thou not planted with thy hands  A lovely vine in heathen lands?  Did not thy power defend it round,  And heavenly dews enrich the ground?    6 How did the spreading branches shoot,  And bless the nations with the fruit!  But now, dear Lord, look down and see  Thy mourning vine, that lovely tree.    7 Why is its beauty thus defac'd?  Why hast thou laid her fences waste?  Strangers and foes against her join,  And every beast devours the vine.    8 Return, almighty God, return,  Nor let thy bleeding vineyard mourn;  Turn us to thee, thy love restore,  We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more.    PAUSE II.    9 Lord, when this vine in Canaan grew  Thou wast its strength and glory too;  Attack'd in vain by all its foes,  Till the fair Branch of Promise rose;    10 Fair Branch, ordain'd of old to shoot  From David's stock, from Jacob's root;  Himself a noble vine, and we  The lesser branches of the tree.    11 'Tis thy own Son, and he shall stand  Girt with thy strength at thy right hand;  Thy first-born Son, adorn'd and blest  With power and grace above the rest.    12 O! for his sake attend our cry,  Shine on thy churches lest they die;  Turn us to thee, thy love restore,  We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more.      Psalm 81. 1 8 16.  The warnings of God to his people; or,  Spiritual blessings and punishments.    1 Sing to the Lord aloud,  And make a joyful noise;  God is our strength, our Saviour God;  Let Israel hear his voice.    2 \"From vile idolatry  \"Preserve my worship clean;  \"I am the Lord who set thee free  \"From slavery and sin.    3 \"Stretch thy desires abroad,  \"And I'll supply them well  \"But if ye will refuse your God,  \"If Israel will rebel,    4 \"I'll leave them,\" saith the Lord,  \"To their own lusts a prey,  \"And let them run the dangerous road,  \"'Tis their own chosen way.    5 \"Yet O! that all my saints  \"Would hearken to my voice!  \"Soon I would ease their sore complaints,  \"And bid their hearts rejoice.    6 \"While I destroy their foes,  \"I'd richly feed my flock,  \"And they should taste the stream that flows  \"From their eternal Rock.\"      Psalm 82.  God the supreme Governor;  or, Magistrates warned.    1 Among th' assemblies of the great,  A greater Ruler takes his seat;  The God of heaven, as Judge, surveys  Those gods on earth and all their ways.    2 Why will ye then frame wicked laws?  Or why support th' unrighteous cause?  When will ye once defend the poor,  That sinners vex the saints no more?    3 They know not, Lord, nor will they know,  Dark are the ways in which they go;  Their name of earthly gods is vain,  For they shall fall and die like men.    4 Arise, O Lord, and let thy Son  Possess his universal throne,  And rule the nations with his rod;  He is our judge, and he our God.      Psalm 83.  A complaint against persecutors.    1 And will the God of grace  Perpetual silence keep?  The God of justice hold his peace,  And let his vengeance sleep?    2 Behold what cursed snares  The men of mischief spread;  The men that hate thy saints and thee  Lift up their threatening head.    3 Against thy hidden ones  Their counsels they employ,  And malice with her watchful eye,  Pursues them to destroy.    4 The noble and the base  Into thy pastures leap;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#20)"],[1,"-five dollars, and indorsed the  stock over to the bank from which the money had been borrowed for him.  The stock almost immediately dropped over fifty points. John paid the  interest on the note out of his salary, and the dividends, as fast as  they were declared, went to extinguish the body of the loan. Some time  afterward he learned that he had bought the stock from the magnate  himself. He never received any benefit from it, for the stock was sold  to cover the note, and John was obliged to make up the difference. He  also discovered that ten or fifteen other employees had been given a  similar opportunity by their generous employer at about the same time.  John, in prison, says it was a scheme to keep fifty or a hundred shares  where it could easily be controlled by the president, without risk to  himself, in case of need. Of course, he may be wrong. At any rate, he  feels bitterly now toward the big men who are at large while he is in  jail.    John continued to keep up with the acquaintances formed during his years  in the broker's office, many of whom had started little businesses of  their own and had done well. Part of their stock-in-trade was to appear  prosperous and they took John out to lunch, and told him what a fine  fellow he was, and gave him sure tips. But John had grown \"wise.\" He had  had all the chances of that sort he wanted, and from a bigger man than  any of them. He ate their lunches and invited them in return. Then he  economized for a day or two to even up. He was not prosperous himself,  but he did not accept favors without repaying them.    One thing he observed and noted carefully--every man he knew who had  begun a brokerage business and kept sober, who attended to business and  did not speculate, made money and plenty of it. He knew one young firm  which cleared up fifteen thousand in commissions at the end of the  second year. That looked good to him, and he knew, besides, that _he_  was sober and attended to business. He made inquiries and learned that  one could start in, if one were modest in one's pretensions, for two  thousand five hundred dollars. That would pay office rent and keep  things going until the commissions began to come in. He started to look  around for some other young man who could put up the money in  consideration of John's contributing the experience. But all the men he  knew had experience without money.    Then by chance he met a young fellow of bright and agreeable personality  whom we shall call Prescott. The latter was five or six years older than  John, had had a large experience in brokerage houses in another city,  and had come to New York to promote the interests of a certain copper  company. John had progressed and was now assistant loan clerk of one of  the biggest trust companies in the city, which also happened to be  transfer agent for the copper company. Thus John had constantly to  handle its certificates. Prescott said it was a wonderful thing--that  some of the keenest men in the Street were in it, and, although it was a  curb stock, strongly advised his new friend to buy all he could of it.  He assured John that, although he was admittedly interested in booming  the stock, he was confident that before long it would sell at four times  its present quotation.    Meantime the stock, which had been listed at 2-1/4, began to go rapidly  up. Word went around the trust company that it was a great purchase  anywhere below 10, and John, as well as the other boys employed in the  company, got together what money he could and began to buy it. It  continued to go up--they had unconsciously assisted it in its  ascent--and they bought more. John purchased seventy-five shares--all  the way up to 8 and 9. One of his friends took eight hundred. Then it  dropped out of sight. They hadn't time to get out, and John, in prison,  has his yet. But he still had faith in Prescott, for he liked him and  believed in his business capacity.    The stock \"operation\" over, Prescott began to prospect for something  new, and suggested to John that they form a brokerage house under the  latter's name. John was to be president at \"a fixed salary.\" It sounded  very grand. His duties at the trust company began to seem picayune.  Moreover, his loss in copper had depressed him and he wanted to recoup,  if he could. But how to get the two thousand five hundred dollars  necessary to start in business? Prescott pleaded poverty, yet talked  constantly of the ease with which a fortune might be made if they could  only once \"get in right.\" It was a period of increased dividends, of  stock-jobbing operations of enormous magnitude, of \"fifty-point  movements,\" when the lucky purchaser of only a hundred shares of some  inconspicuous railroad sometimes found that he could sell out next week  with five thousand dollars' profit. The air seemed full of money. It  appeared to rain banknotes and stock certificates.    In the \"loan cage\" at the trust company John handled daily millions in  securities, a great part of which were negotiable. When almost everybody  was so rich he wondered why any one remained poor. Two or three men of  his own age gave up their jobs in other concerns and became traders,  while another opened an office of his own. John was told that they had  acted on \"good information,\" had bought a few hundred shares of Union  Pacific, and were now comfortably fixed. He would have been glad to  buy, but copper had left him without anything to buy with.    One day Prescott took him out to lunch and confided to him that one of  the big speculators had tipped him off to buy cotton, since there was  going to be a failure in the crop. It was practically a sure thing. Two  thousand dollars' margin would buy enough cotton to start them in  business, even if the rise was only a very small one.    \"Why don't you borrow a couple of bonds?\" asked Prescott.    \"Borrow from whom?\" inquired John.    \"Why, from some customer of the trust company.\"    \"No one would lend them to me,\" answered John.    \"Well, borrow them, anyhow. They would never know about it, and you  could put them back as soon as we closed the account,\" suggested  Prescott.    John was shocked, and said so.    \"You are easy,\" said his comrade. \"Don't you know that the trust  companies do it themselves all the time? The presidents of the railroads  use the holdings of their companies as collateral. Even the banks use  their deposits for trading. Didn't old ---- dump a lot of rotten stuff  on you? Why don't you get even? Let me tell you something. Fully  one-half of the men who are now successful financiers got their start by  putting up as margin securities deposited with them. No one ever knew  the difference, and now they are on their feet. If you took two bonds  overnight you might put them back in the morning. Every one does it.  It's part of the game.\"    \"But suppose we lost?\" asked John.    \"You can't,\" said Prescott. \"Cotton is sure to go up. It's throwing away  the chance of your life.\"    John said he couldn't do such a thing, but when he returned to the  office the cashier told him that a merger had been planned between their  company and another--a larger one. John knew what that meant well  enough--half the clerks would lose their positions. He was getting  thirty-five dollars a week, had married a young wife, and, as he had  told the magnate, he \"needed it all.\" That night as he put the  securities from the \"loan cage\" back in the vault the bonds burned his  fingers. They were lying around loose, no good to anybody, and only two  of them, overnight maybe, would make him independent of salaries and  mergers--a free man and his own master.    The vault was in the basement just below the loan cage. It was some  twenty feet long and ten wide. There were three tiers of boxes with  double combination doors. In the extreme left-hand corner was the \"loan  box.\" Near it were two other boxes in which the securities of certain  customers on deposit were kept. John had individual access to the loan  box and the two others--one of which contained the collateral which  secured loans that were practically permanent. He thus had within his  control negotiable bonds of over a million dollars in value. The  securities were in piles, strapped with rubber bands, and bore slips on  which were written the names of the owners. Every morning John carried  up all these piles to the loan cage--except the securities on deposit.  At the end of the day he carried all back himself and tossed them into  the boxes. When the interest coupons on the deposited bonds had to be  cut he carried these, also, upstairs. At night the vault was secured by  two doors, one with a combination lock and the other with a time lock.  It was as safe as human ingenuity could make it. By day it had only a  steel-wire gate which could be opened with a key. No attendant was  stationed at the door. If John wanted to get in, all he had to do was to  ask the person who had the key to open it. The reason John had the  combination to these different boxes was in order to save the loan clerk  the trouble of going downstairs to get the collateral himself.    Next day when John went out to lunch he put two bonds belonging to a  customer in his pocket. He did not intend to steal them or even to  borrow them. It was done almost automatically. His will seemed  subjugated to the idea that they were to all intents and purposes _his_  bonds to do as he liked with. He wanted the feeling of  bonds-in-his-pocket. As he walked along the street to the restaurant, it  seemed quite natural that they should be there. They were nearly as safe  with him as lying around loose in the cage or chucked into a box in the  vault. Prescott joined him, full of his new idea that cotton was going  to jump overnight.    \"If you only had a couple of bonds,\" he sighed.    Then somehow John's legs and arms grew weak. He seemed to disintegrate  internally. He tried to pull himself together, but he "]]]
