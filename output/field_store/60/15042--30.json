Savage was surprised at the meanness  of the entertainment, and after some hesitation, ventured to ask for  wine, which Sir Richard, not without reluctance ordered to be brought.  They then finished their dinner, and proceeded in their pamphlet,  which they concluded in the afternoon. Mr. Savage then imagined his  task over, and expected that Sir Richard would call for the reckoning  and return home; but his expectations deceived him, for Sir Richard  told him he was without money and that the pamphlet must be sold  before the dinner could be paid for; and Savage was therefore obliged  to go and offer their new production to sale for two guineas, which  with some difficulty he obtained. Sir Richard then returned home,  having retired that day only to avoid his creditors, and composed the  pamphlet only to discharge his reckoning.' As Savage has said nothing  to the contrary, it is reasonable to conjecture that he had Sir  Richard's permission to use his name to the Bookseller, to whom he  made an offer of it for two guineas, otherwise it is very improbable  that the pamphlet should be sold at all in so short a time.    The other instance is equally uncommon with the former: Sir Richard  having incited to his house a great number of persons of the  first quality, they were surprized at the number of liveries which  surrounded the table; and after dinner, when wine and mirth had  set them free from the observation of rigid ceremony, one of them  enquired of Sir Richard, how such an expensive train of domestics  could be consistent with his fortune? Sir Richard frankly confessed,  that they were fellows of whom he would very willingly be rid. And  being then asked why he did not discharge them; he declared that they  were Bailiffs who had introduced themselves with an execution, and  whom, since he could not send them away, he had thought it convenient  to imbellish with liveries, that they might do him credit whilst they  staid.    His friends were diverted with the expedient, and by paying the debt,  discharged the attendance, having obliged Sir Richard to promise that  they should never find him again graced with a retinue of the same  kind.    He married to his first wife a gentlewoman of Barbadoes, with whom he  had a valuable Plantation there on the death of her brother, who was  taken by the French at Sea as he was coming to England, and died in  France. This wife dying without issue, he married Mary, the daughter  of Jonathan Scurlock of Langunnoc in Carmarthanshire, esq; by whom he  had one son, Eugene, who died young: of his two daughters, one only is  living; which lady became sole heiress to a handsome estate in Wales.  She was married, when young, to the hon. John Trevor, esq; one of the  judges of the principality of Wales; who since, by the death of his  brother, has taken his seat in the House of Lords, as Baron Trevor,  &c.      [Footnote A: General Dictionary, vol. ix, p. 395.]    [Footnote B: His expulsion was owing to the spleen of the then  prevailing party; what they design'd as a disgrace, prov'd an honour  to him.]           *       *       *       *       *          ANDREW MARVEL, Esq;[A]      This ingenious gentleman was the son of Mr. Andrew Marvel, Minister  and Schoolmaster of Kingston upon Hull in Yorkshire, and was born in  that town in the year 1620[B]. He was admitted into Trinity College  in Cambridge December 14, 1633, where he had not been long before his  studies were interrupted by the following accident:    Some Jesuits with whom he familiarly conversed, observing in him a  genius beyond his years, used their utmost efforts to proselyte him  to their faith, which they imagined they could more easily accomplish  while he was yet young. They so far succeeded as to seduce him  from the college, and carry him to London, where, after some months  absence, his father found him in a Bookseller's shop, and prevailed  upon him to return to the college.    He afterwards pursued his studies with the most indefatigable  application, and in the year 1638, took the degree of bachelor of  arts, and the same year was admitted scholar of the house, that is,  of the foundation at Trinity College[C]. We have no farther account of  him for several years after this, only that he travelled through  the most polite parts of the world, but in what quality we are not  certain, unless in that of secretary to the embassy at Constantinople.    While our author was in France, he wrote his poem entitled Cuidam, qui  legendo Scripturam, descripsit Formam, Sapientiam, Sortemque Authoris.  Illustrissimo Viro Domino Lanceloto Josepho de Maniban Grammatomanti.    The person to whom he addresses these verses was an Abbot, famous  for entering into the qualities of those whom he had never seen, and  prognosticating their good, or bad fortune from an inspection of their  hand-writing.    During the troubles of the Republic we find him tutor to one Mr.  Dutton, a young gentleman; as appears from an original letter of his  to Oliver Cromwel. This letter sent to so extraordinary a person by  a man of Mr. Marvel's consequence, may excite the reader's curiosity,  with which, he shall be gratified. It carries in it much of that  stiffness and pedantry peculiar to the times, and is very different  from the usual stile of our author.      'May it please your LORDSHIP,    'It might perhaps seem fit for me to seek out words to give your  excellence thanks for myself. But indeed the only civility, which it  is fit for me to practise with so eminent a person, is to obey  you, and to perform honestly this work which you have set me about.  Therefore I shall use the time that your lordship is pleased to allow  me for writing, only to that purpose for which you have given me it,  that is to render you some account of Mr. Dutton. I have taken care  to examine him several times in the presence of Mr. Oxenbridge[D], as  those who weigh and tell over money, before some witnesses e'er they  take charge of it; for I thought that there might be possibly some  lightness in the coin, or error in the telling, which hereafter I  might be bound to make good. Therefore Mr. Oxenbridge is the best to  make your excellence an impartial relation thereof; I shall only say,  that I shall strive according to my best understanding to increase  whatsoever talent he may have already. Truly he is of a gentle, and  waxen disposition; and, God be praised, I cannot say that he hath  brought with him any evil impression; and I hope to set nothing upon  his spirit, but what shall be of a good sculpture. He hath in him two  things, which make youth most easily to be managed, modesty, which is  the bridle to vice, and emulation, which is the spur to virtue. And  the care which your excellency is pleased to take of him, is no small  encouragement, and shall be represented to him; but above all, I shall  labour to make him sensible of his duty to God, for then we begin to  serve faithfully, when we consider that he is our master; and in this  both he and I owe infinitely to your lordship, for having placed in so  godly a family as that of Mr. Oxenbridge, whose doctrine and  example are like a book and a map, not only instructing the ear, but  demonstrating to the eye which way we ought to travel. I shall upon  occasion henceforward inform your excellency of any particularities  in our little affairs. I have no more at present but to give thanks to  God for your lordship, and to beg grace of him, to approve myself.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Marvel's first appearance in public business at home, was, in  being assistant to Milton as Latin secretary to the Protector. He  himself tells us, in a piece called The Rehearsal Transposed, that  he never had any, not the remotest relation to public matters, nor  correspondence with the persons then predominant, until the year 1657,  when indeed, says he, 'I entered into an employment, for which I  was not altogether improper, and which I considered to be the most  innocent, and inoffensive towards his Majesty's affairs of any in that  usurped, and irregular government, to which all men were then exposed;  and this I accordingly discharged, without disobliging any one person,  there having been opportunities, and endeavours since his Majesty's  happy return, to have discovered, had it been otherwise.'    A little before the Restoration, he was chosen by his native  town, Kingston upon Hull, to sit in that Parliament which began at  Westminster April 25, 1660, and again after the Restoration for that  which began at the same place May 8, 1661. In this station our author  discharged his trust with the utmost fidelity, and always shewed a  peculiar regard for those he represented; for he constantly sent the  particulars of every proceeding in the House, to the heads of the town  for which he was elected; and to those accounts he always joined  his own opinion. This respectful behaviour gained so much on their  affections, that they allowed him an honourable pension to his death,  all which time he continued in Parliament. Mr. Marvel was not endowed  with the gift of eloquence, for he seldom spoke in the house; but was  however capable of forming an excellent judgment of things, and was so  acute a discerner of characters, that his opinion was greatly valued,  and he had a powerful influence over many of the Members without  doors. Prince Rupert particularly esteemed him, and whenever he voted  agreeable to the sentiments of Mr. Marvel, it was a saying of the  opposite party, he has been with his tutor. The intimacy between this  illustrious foreigner, and our author was so great, that when it was  unsafe for the latter to have it known where he lived, on account of  some mischief which was threatened him, the prince would frequently  visit him in a disguised habit. Mr. Marvel was often in such danger of  assassination, that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#20)"],[1,"one. And how horrible was this being left  alone under the circumstances; how sad the silence in which they sat  opposite each other! How strange the glance which the emperor fastened  on his wife!    She read in his excited, quivering features the struggle that moved his  soul, but she also read in them that her hour was come!    As he now approached her, his outstretched hand trembled, and Josephine  shudderingly recoiled.    Napoleon took her hand in his, and laid it on his heart, regarding her  with a long and sorrowful farewell-glance.    \"Josephine,\" said he, his voice trembling with emotion, \"my good  Josephine, you know that I have loved you! To you, and to you alone, do  I owe the only moments of happiness I have enjoyed in this world.  Josephine, my destiny is stronger than my will. My dearest desires must  yield to the interests of France[17].\"    [Footnote 17: The emperor's own words. See Bourrienne, vol. iii., p.  344.]    \"Speak no further,\" cried Josephine, withdrawing her hand angrily--\"no,  speak no further. I understand you, and I expected this, but the blow is  not the less deadly.\"    She could speak no further, her voice failed. A feeling of despair came  over her; the long-repressed storm of agony at last broke forth. She  wept, she wrung her hands; groans escaped her heaving breast, and a loud  cry of anguish burst from her lips. She at last fainted away, and was  thus relieved from a consciousness of her sufferings.    When she awoke she found herself on her bed, and Hortense and her  physician Corvisart at her side. Josephine stretched out her trembling  arms toward her daughter, who threw herself on her mother's heart,  sobbing bitterly. Corvisart silently withdrew, feeling that he could be  of no further assistance. It had only been in his power to recall  Josephine to a consciousness of her misery; but for her misery itself he  had no medicine; he knew that her tears and her daughter's sympathy  could alone give relief.    Josephine lay weeping in her daughter's arms, when Napoleon came in to  inquire after her condition. As he seated himself at her bedside, she  shrank back with a feeling of horror, her tears ceased to flow, and her  usually so mild and joyous eyes now shot glances of anger and offended  love at the emperor. But love soon conquered anger. She extended her  tremulous hand to Napoleon; the sad, sweet smile, peculiar to woman,  trembled on her lips, and, in a gentle, touching voice, she said: \"Was  I not right, my friend, when I shrank back in terror from the thought of  becoming an empress[18]?\"    [Footnote 18: Josephine's own narrative. See Bourrienne, vol. iii., p.  342, _et seq_.]    Napoleon made no reply. He turned away and wept. But these farewell  tears of his love could not change Josephine's fate; the emperor had  already determined it irrevocably. His demand of the hand of the  Archduchess Marie Louise had already been acceded to in Vienna. Nothing  now remained to be done but to remove Josephine from the throne, and  elevate a new, a legitimate empress, to the vacant place!    The emperor could not and would not retrace his steps. He assembled  about him all his brothers, all the kings, dukes, and princes, created  by his mighty will, and in the state-chambers of the Tuileries, in the  presence of his court and the Senate, the emperor appeared; at his side  the empress, arrayed for the last time in all the insignia of the  dignity she was about to lay aside forever.    In a loud, firm voice the emperor declared to the assembly his  determination to divorce himself from his wife; and Josephine, in a  trembling voice, often interrupted by tears, repeated her husband's  words. The arch-chancellor, Cambaceres, then caused the appropriate  paragraph of the _Code Civile_ to be read, applied it to the case under  consideration, in a short, terse address, and pronounced the union of  the emperor and empress dissolved.    This ended the ceremony, and satisfied the requirements of the law.  Josephine had now only to take leave of her husband and of the court,  and she did this with the gentle, angelic composure, in the graceful,  sweet manner, which was hers in a degree possessed by few other women.    As she bowed profoundly to Napoleon, her pale face illumined by inward  emotion, his lips murmured a few inaudible words, and his iron  countenance quivered for an instant with pain. As she then walked  through the chamber, her children, Hortense and Eugene, on either side,  and greeted all with a last soft look, a last inclination of the head,  nothing could be heard but weeping, and even those who rejoiced over her  downfall, because they hoped much from the new empress and the new  dynasty, were now moved to tears by this silent and yet so eloquent  leave-taking.    The sacrifice was accomplished. Napoleon had sacrificed his dearest  possession to ambition; he had divorced himself from Josephine.    On the same day she left the Tuileries to repair to Malmaison, her  future home--to Malmaison, that had once been the paradise, and was now  to be the widow's seat, of her love.    Josephine left the court, but the hearts of those who constituted this  court did not leave her. During the next few weeks the crowds of the  coming and going on the road from Paris to Malmaison presented the  appearance of a procession; the equipages of all the kings and princes  who were sojourning in Paris, and of all the nobles and dignitaries of  the new France, were to be seen there. Even the Faubourg St.-Germain,  that still preserved its sympathy for the Bourbons, repaired to the  empress at Malmaison. And this pilgrimage was made by the poor and  humble, as well as by the rich and great. All wished to say to the  empress that they still loved and honored her, and that she was still  enthroned in their hearts, although her rule on the throne was at  an end.    The whole people mourned with Josephine and her children. It was  whispered about that Napoleon's star would now grow pale; that, with  Josephine, his good angel had left him, and that the future would avenge  her tears.        CHAPTER IX.    THE KING OF HOLLAND.    While Josephine was weeping over her divorce at Malmaison, Hortense was  seeking one for herself. A divorce which her mother lamented as a  misfortune, because she still loved her husband, would have conferred  happiness upon Hortense, who never had loved her husband. Once again in  harmony with her husband, Hortense entreated the emperor to permit them  to be divorced, and the king united his entreaties with those of  the queen.    But Napoleon was unrelenting. His family should not appear before the  people as disregarding the sanctity of the marriage bond. For state  reasons he had separated from his wife, and for state reasons he could  not give his consent to the dissolution of the union of his brother and  step-daughter. They must, therefore, continue to drag the chain that  united them; and they did, but with angry hearts.    Louis returned to Holland in a more depressed state of mind than ever;  while Hortense and her two children, in obedience to Napoleon's express  command, remained in Paris for some time. They were to attend the  festivities that were soon to take place at the imperial court in honor  of the marriage of the emperor with the Archduchess Marie Louise of  Austria. The daughter of the divorced empress, with the emperor's  sisters, had been selected to carry the train of the new empress on the  marriage-day. Napoleon wished to prove to France and to all Europe that  there was no other law in his family than his will, and that the  daughter of Josephine had never ceased to be his obedient daughter also.  Napoleon wished, moreover, to retain near his young wife, in order that  she might have at her side a gentle and tender mentor, the queen who had  inherited Josephine's grace and loveliness, and who, in her noble  womanhood, would set a good example to the ladies of his court. Hortense  mutely obeyed the emperor's command; on the 1st of April, 1810, the day  of the union of Marie Louise with the emperor, she, together with his  sisters, bore the train of the new empress. She alone did this without  making any resistance, while it was only after the most violent  opposition to Napoleon's command that his sisters, Queen Caroline of  Naples, the Duchess Pauline of Guastalla, and the Grand-duchess Elise of  Tuscany, consented to undergo the humiliation of walking behind their  new sovereign as humble subjects. And the emperor's sisters were not  the only persons who regarded the imperial pair with displeasure on the  day of the marriage celebration. Only a small number of the high  dignitaries of the Church had responded to the invitation of the  grand-master of ceremonies, and attended the marriage celebration in the  chapel in the Tuileries.    The emperor, who did not wish to punish his sisters for their  opposition, could at least punish the absence of the cardinals, and he  did this on the following day. He exiled those cardinals who had not  appeared in the chapel, forbade them to appear in their red robes  thenceforth, and condemned them to the black penitent's dress.    The people of Paris also received the new empress with a languid  enthusiasm. They regarded the new \"Austrian\" with gloomy forebodings;  and when, on the occasion of the ball given by Prince Schwartzenberg in  honor of the imperial marriage, a short time afterward, the fearful fire  occurred that cost so many human lives and destroyed so much family  happiness, the people remembered with terror that other misfortune that  had occurred on the day of the entry of Marie Antoinette into Paris, and  called this fire an earnest of the misfortunes which the \"Austrian\"  would bring upon France and the emperor.    While Hortense was compelled to attend the festivities given in honor of  the new empress in Paris, a dark storm-cloud was gathering over her  husband's head, that"]]]
