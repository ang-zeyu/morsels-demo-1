In features he is well made, dark chestnut color, and intelligent,  possessing an ardent thirst for liberty. The cause of his escape was:  \"Worked hard in all sorts of weather--in rain and snow,\" so he thought  he would \"go where colored men are free.\" His master was considered the  hardest man around. His mistress was \"eighty-three years of age,\" \"drank  hard,\" was \"very stormy,\" and a \"member of the Methodist Church\" (Airy's  meeting-house). He left brothers and sisters, and uncles and aunts  behind. In the combat at the prison he played his part manfully.             *       *       *       *       *          THOMAS ELLIOTT.      Thomas is also one of the brave eight who broke out of Dover Jail. He  was about twenty-three years of age, well made, wide awake, and of a  superb black complexion. He too had been owned by Richard Meredith.  Against the betrayer, who was a black man, he had vengeance in store if  the opportunity should ever offer. Thomas left only one brother living;  his \"father and mother were dead.\"    The excitement over the escape spread very rapidly next morning, and  desperate efforts were made to recapture the fugitives, but a few  friends there were who had sympathy and immediately rendered them the  needed assistance.    The appended note from the faithful Garrett to Samuel Rhoads, may throw  light upon the occurrence to some extent.          WILMINGTON, 3d mo. 13th, 1857.        DEAR COUSIN, SAMUEL RHOADS:--I have a letter this day from an      agent of the Underground Rail Road, near Dover, in this state,      saying I must be on the look out for six brothers and two      sisters, they were decoyed and betrayed, he says by a colored      man named Thomas Otwell, who pretended to be their friend, and      sent a _white scamp_ ahead to wait for them at Dover till they      arrived; they were arrested and put in Jail there, with Tom's      assistance, and some officers. On third day morning about four      o'clock, they broke jail; six of them are secreted in the      neighborhood, and the writer has not known what became of the      other two. The six were to start last night for this place. I      hear that their owners have persons stationed at several places      on the road watching. I fear they will be taken. If they could      lay quiet for ten days or two weeks, they might then get up      safe. I shall have two men sent this evening some four or five      miles below to keep them away from this town, and send them (if      found to Chester County). Thee may show this to Still and McKim,      and oblige thy cousin,        THOMAS GARRETT.      Further light about this exciting contest, may be gathered from a  colored conductor on the Road, in Delaware, who wrote as follows to a  member of the Vigilance Committee at Philadelphia.          CAMDEN, DEL., March 23d, 1857.        DEAR SIR;--I tak my pen in hand to write to you, to inform you      what we have had to go throw for the last two weaks.

The balance of these brave fugitives, although not named in this  connection, succeeded in getting off safely. But how the betrayer,  sheriff and hunters got out of their dilemma, the Committee was never  fully posted.    The Committee found great pleasure in assisting these passengers, for  they had the true grit. Such were always doubly welcome.             *       *       *       *       *          MARY EPPS, ALIAS EMMA BROWN--JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON.      A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD--BOB ESCAPES  FROM HIS MASTER, A TRADER, WITH $1500 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY.      Mary fled from Petersburg and the Robinsons from Richmond. A fugitive  slave law-breaking captain by the name of B., who owned a schooner, and  would bring any kind of freight that would pay the most, was the  conductor in this instance. Quite a number of passengers at different  times availed themselves of his accommodations and thus succeeded in  reaching Canada.    His risk was very great. On this account he claimed, as did certain  others, that it was no more than fair to charge for his services--indeed  he did not profess to bring persons for nothing, except in rare  instances. In this matter the Committee did not feel disposed to  interfere directly in any way, further than to suggest that whatever  understanding was agreed upon by the parties themselves should be  faithfully adhered to.    Many slaves in cities could raise, \"by hook or by crook,\" fifty or one  hundred dollars to pay for a passage, providing they could find one who  was willing to risk aiding them. Thus, while the Vigilance Committee of  Philadelphia especially neither charged nor accepted anything for their  services, it was not to be expected that any of the Southern agents  could afford to do likewise.    The husband of Mary had for a long time wanted his own freedom, but did  not feel that he could go without his wife; in fact, he resolved to get  her off first, then to try and escape himself, if possible. The first  essential step towards success, he considered, was to save his money and  make it an object to the captain to help him. So when he had managed to  lay by one hundred dollars, he willingly offered this sum to Captain B.,  if he would engage to deliver his wife into the hands of the Vigilance  Committee of Philadelphia. The captain agreed to the terms and fulfilled  his engagement to the letter. About the 1st of March, 1855, Mary was  presented to the Vigilance Committee. She was of agreeable manners,  about forty-five years of age, dark complexion, round built, and  intelligent. She had been the mother of fifteen children, four of whom  had been sold away from her; one was still held in slavery in  Petersburg; the others were all dead.    At the sale of one of her children she was so affected with grief that  she was thrown into violent convulsions, which caused the loss of her  speech for one entire month. But this little episode was not a matter to  excite sympathy in the breasts of the highly refined and tender-hearted  Christian mothers of Petersburg. In the mercy of Providence, however,  her reason and strength returned.    She had formerly belonged to the late Littleton Reeves, whom she  represented as having been \"kind\" to her, much more so than her mistress  (Mrs. Reeves). Said Mary, \"She being of a jealous disposition, caused me  to be hired out with a hard family, where I was much abused, frequently  flogged, and stinted for food,\" etc.    But the sweets of freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee now  delighted her mind, and the hope that her husband would soon follow her  to Canada, inspired her with expectations that she would one day \"sit  under her own vine and fig tree where none dared to molest or make her  afraid.\"    The Committee rendered her the usual assistance, and in due time,  forwarded her on to Queen Victoria's free land in Canada. On her arrival  she wrote back as follows--          TORONTO, March 14th, 1855.        DEAR MR. STILL:--I take this opportunity of addressing you with      these few lines to inform you that I arrived here to-day, and      hope that this may find yourself and Mrs. Still well, as this      leaves me at the present. I will also say to you, that I had no      difficulty in getting along. the two young men that was with me      left me at Suspension Bridge. they went another way.        I cannot say much about the place as I have ben here but a short      time but so far as I have seen I like very well. you will give      my Respect to your lady, & Mr & Mrs Brown. If you have not      written to Petersburg you will please to write as soon as can I      have nothing More to Write at present but yours Respectfully        EMMA BROWN (old name MARY EPPS).      Now, Joseph and Robert (Mary's associate passengers from Richmond) must  here be noticed. Joseph was of a dark orange color, medium size, very  active and intelligent, and doubtless, well understood the art of  behaving himself. He was well acquainted with the auction block--having  been sold three times, and had had the misfortune to fall into the hands  of a cruel master each time. Under these circumstances he had had but  few privileges. Sundays and week days alike he was kept pretty severely  bent down to duty. He had been beaten and knocked around shamefully. He  had a wife, and spoke of her in most endearing language, although, on  leaving, he did not feel at liberty to apprise her of his movements,  \"fearing that it would not be safe so to do.\" His four little children,  to whom he appeared warmly attached, he left as he did his wife--in  Slavery. He declared that he \"stuck to them as long as he could.\" George  E. Sadler, the keeper of an oyster house, held the deed for \"Joe,\" and a  most heartless wretch he was in Joe's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],[0,"Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#20)"],[1,"g, and he has  gone to the wrong place, and he'll be eaten,\" said the big ant. \"We must  save him. Come on, everybody!\"    So all the ants hurried along together, and crawled to the castle of the  bad giant, and they got there just as he was putting some molasses on  Uncle Wiggily to eat him. And those ants crawled all over the giant, on  his legs and arms, and nose and ears and toes, and they tickled him so  that he squiggled and wiggled and squirreled and whirled, and finally he  let Uncle Wiggily fall on a feather bed, not hurting him a bit, and the  rabbit gentleman hopped safely away and the ants crawled with him far from  the castle of the bad giant.    So Uncle Wiggily was saved by the ants, and in case the trolley car  doesn't run over my stick of peppermint candy, and make it look like a  lolly-pop, I'll tell you soon about Uncle Wiggily and the good giant.          STORY XXIX    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GOOD GIANT      Now what do you s'pose that bad giant had for supper the night after the  ants helped Uncle Wiggily get away? You'd never guess, so I'll tell you.  It was beans--just baked beans, and that giant was so disappointed, and  altogether so cut-up about not having rabbit stew, that he ate so many  beans, that I'm almost afraid to tell you just how many.    But if all the boys in your school were to take their bean shooters, and  shoot beans out of a bag for a million years, and Fourth of July also,  that giant could eat all of them, and more too--that is, if he could get  the beans after the boys shot them away.    \"Well, I certainly must be more careful after this,\" said Uncle Wiggily to  the ants, as they crawled along down the hill with him, when he hopped  away from the bad giant's house.    \"Oh, it wasn't your fault,\" said the second size big red ant, with black  and yellow stripes on his stockings. \"That bad giant changed the flags,  and that's what fooled you. But I guess the good giant will have his flag  back by to-morrow, and then you can go to the right house. We'll go along  and show you, and you may get your fortune from him.\"    So, surely enough, the next day, the good giant went over and took his  flag away from the bad giant, and put it upon his own house.    \"Now you'll be all right,\" said the pink ant, with purple spots on his  necktie. \"You won't make any mistake now, Uncle Wiggily. I'm sure the good  giant will give you a good fortune.\"    \"Yes, and he'll give you lots to eat,\" said the black ant with white rings  around his nose.    Well, Uncle Wiggily took his valise and his crutch and up toward the good  giant's house he went, with the ants crawling along in the sand to show  him the way.    Pretty soon they came to a big bridge, over a stream of water, and this  was the beginning of the place where the good giant lived.    \"We'll all have to go back now,\" said the purple ant, with the green  patchwork squares on his checks. \"If we crossed over the bridge we might  fall off and be drowned. We'll go back, but you go ahead, and we wish you  good luck, Uncle Wiggily.\"    \"Indeed we do,\" said a white ant with gold buckles on her shoes.    Well, after a little while Uncle Wiggily found himself right inside the  good giant's house. And oh! what a big place it was. Why, even the door  mat was so big that it took the rabbit three hops to get to the top of it.  And that front door! I wish you could have seen it! It was as large as one  of your whole houses, and it was only a door, mind you.    \"Hello! hello!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, as he pounded with his crutch on the  floor. \"Is any one at home?\"    \"But no one answered, and there wasn't a sound except the ticking of the  clock, and that made as much noise as a railroad train going over a  bridge, for the clock was a big as a church steeple.    \"Hum! No one is home,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll just sit down and make  myself comfortable.\" So he sat down on the floor by the table that was  away over his head, and waited for the giant to come back.    And, all of a sudden, the rabbit heard a noise like a steam engine going,  and he was quite surprised, until he happened to look up, and there stood  a pussy cat as big as a cow, and the cat was purring, which made the noise  like a steam engine.    \"My, if that's the size of the cat, what must the giant be,\" thought the  rabbit. \"I do hope he's good-natured when he comes home.\"    Well, pretty soon, in a little while, as Uncle Wiggily was sitting there,  listening to the big cat purr, he felt sleepy, and he was just going to  sleep, when he heard a gentle voice singing:        \"Oh, see the blackbird, sitting in the tree,      Hear him singing, jolly as can be.      Now he'll whistle a pretty little tune,      Isn't it delicious in the month of June?        \"Hear the bees a-buzzing, hour by hour,      Gathering the honey from every little flower.      The katydid is singing by his own front door,      Now I'll have to stop this song--I don't know any more.\"    \"Well, whoever that is, he's a jolly chap,\" said the rabbit, and with that  who should come in but the giant himself.    \"Ho! Ho! Whom have we here?\" the giant asked, looking at Uncle Wiggily.  \"What do you want, my little furry friend with the long ears? You must be  able to hear very well with them.\"    \"I can hear pretty well,\" said the rabbit. \"But I came to seek my  fortune.\"    \"Fine,\" cried the good giant, for he it was. \"I'll do all I can for you,\"  and he laughed so long and hard that part of the ceiling and the gas  chandelier fell down, but the giant caught them in his strong hands, and  not even the pussy cat was hurt. Then the giant sung another song, like  the first, only different, and he fixed the broken ceiling, and said:    \"Now for something to eat! Then we'll talk about your fortune. I'll get  you some carrots.\" So he went out, and pretty soon he came back, carrying  ten barrels of carrots in one hand and seventeen bushels of cabbage in the  other.    \"Here's a little light lunch for you,\" he said to Uncle Wiggily. \"Eat  this, and I'll get you some more, when we have a regular meal.\"    \"Oh, why this is more than I could eat in a year,\" said the rabbit, \"but I  thank you very much,\" so he nibbled at one carrot, while the good giant  ate fifteen thousand seven hundred and eight loaves of bread, and two  million bushels of jam. Then he felt better.    \"So you want to find your fortune, eh?\" the giant said to the rabbit.  \"Well, now I'll help you all I can. How would you like to stay here and  work for me? You have good ears, and you could listen for burglars in the  night when I am asleep. Will you?\"    \"I think I will,\" said Uncle Wiggily. And he was just reaching for  another carrot, when suddenly from outside sounded a terrible racket.    \"Where is he? Let me get at him! I want him right away--that rabbit I  mean!\" cried a voice, and Uncle Wiggily jumped up in great fright, and  looked for some place to hide. The giant jumped up, too, and grabbed his  big club.    But don't be alarmed. Nothing bad is going to happen to our Uncle  Wiggily--in fact he is going to have lots of fun soon.    So if my motorboat doesn't turn upside down and spill out the pink  lemonade, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the  giant's little boy.          STORY XXX    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GIANT'S BOY      Let me see, I believe I left off where Uncle Wiggily was in the house of  the good giant, and the old gentleman rabbit heard a terrible noise.  Didn't I?    \"My goodness!\" exclaimed the rabbit, jumping up so quickly that he upset  one of the giant's toothpicks, on which he had been sitting for a chair,  for the giant's toothpicks were as large as a big chestnut tree. \"My  goodness!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, \"what in the world is that?\"    \"I guess it's my little boy coming home from school,\" said the good giant  as softly as he could, but, even then, his voice was like thunder. \"He  must have heard that you were here.\"    \"Will he hurt me? Does he love animals?\" asked the rabbit, for he was  getting frightened. \"Will your little boy be kind to me?\"    \"Oh, indeed he will!\" cried the good giant. \"I have taught him to love  animals, for you know he is so big and strong, even though I do call him  my _little_ boy, that it would be no trouble for him to take a bear or a  lion, and squeeze him in one hand so that the bear or lion would never  hurt any one any more. But, just because he is big and strong, though not  so big and strong as I am, I have taught my boy to be kind to the little  animals.\"    \"Then I will have no fear,\" said Uncle Wiggily, winking his nose--I mean  his eyes--and just then the door of the giant's house opened and in came  his little boy.    Well, at first Uncle Wiggily was so frightened that he did not know what  to do. I wonder what you would say if you were suddenly to see a boy  almost as big as your house, or mine, walk into the parlor, and sit down  at the piano? Well, that's what the old gentleman rabbit saw.    \"Ah, my little boy is home from school,\" said the giant, kindly. \"Did you  have your lessons, my son?\"    \"Yes, father, I did,\" was the answer. \"And I learned a new song. I'll sing  it for you.\"    So he began to play the piano with his little finger nail, and still, and  with all that, he made as much noise as a circus band of music can make on  a hot day in the tent. Oh, he played terribly loud, the giant's boy did,  and Uncle Wiggily had to put his paws over his ears, or he might have been  made deaf. Then the giant's little boy sang, and even when he hummed it  the noise was like a thunder storm, only different. Now, this is the boy  giant's song, and you will have to sing it with all your might, as hard as  you can, but not if the baby is asleep.        \"I am a little fellow,        But soon I will grow big.      And then I'll sit beside the sea,        And in the white sand dig.        \"I'll make a hole so very deep,        To China it will go.      And then I'll fill it"]]]
