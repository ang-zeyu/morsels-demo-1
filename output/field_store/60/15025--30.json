So now Gunnar goes  to her again, and asked her, what wrought her woe, or if there were  anything that might amend it.    \"I will not live,\" says Brynhild, \"for Sigurd has bewrayed me, yea,  and thee no less, whereas thou didst suffer him to come into my bed:  lo thou, two men in one dwelling I will not have; and this shall be  Sigurd's death, or thy death, or my death;--for now has he told Gudrun  all, and she is mocking me even now!\"        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Sunder.        CHAPTER XXX. Of the Slaying of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane.    Thereafter Brynhild went out, and sat under her bower-wall, and had  many words of wailing to say, and still she cried that all things were  loathsome to her, both land and lordship alike, so she might not have  Sigurd.    But therewith came Gunnar to her yet again, and Brynhild spake, \"Thou  shalt lose both realm and wealth, and thy life and me, for I shall fare  home to my kin, and abide there in sorrow, unless thou slayest Sigurd  and his son; never nourish thou a wolfcub.\"    Gunnar grew sick at heart thereat, and might nowise see what fearful  thing lay beneath it all; he was bound to Sigurd by oath, and this way  and that way swung the heart within him; but at the last he bethought  him of the measureless shame if his wife went from him, and he said  within himself, \"Brynhild is better to me than all things else, and the  fairest woman of all women, and I will lay down my life rather than lose  the love of her.\" And herewith he called to him his brother and spake,--    \"Trouble is heavy on me,\" and he tells him that he must needs slay  Sigurd, for that he has failed him where in he trusted him; \"so let us  be lords of the gold and the realm withal.\"    Hogni answers, \"Ill it behoves us to break our oaths with wrack and  wrong, and withal great aid we have in him; no kings shall be as  great as we, if so be the King of the Hun-folk may live; such another  brother-in-law never may we get again; bethink thee how good it is to  have such a brother-in-law, and such sons to our sister! But well I see  how things stand, for this has Brynhild stirred thee up to, and surely  shall her counsel drag us into huge shame and scathe.\"    Gunnar says, \"Yet shall it be brought about: and, lo, a rede  thereto;--let us egg on our brother Guttorm to the deed; he is young,  and of little knowledge, and is clean out of all the oaths moreover.\"    \"Ah, set about in ill wise,\" says Hogni, \"and though indeed it may well  be compassed, a due reward shall we gain for the bewrayal of such a man  as is Sigurd.\"    Gunnar says, \"Sigurd shall die, or I shall die.\"    And therewith he bids Brynhild arise and be glad at heart: so she arose,  and still ever she said that Gunnar should come no more into her bed  till the deed was done.    So the brothers fall to talk, and Gunnar says that it is a deed well  worthy of death, that taking of Brynhild's maidenhead; \"So come now, let  us prick on Guttorm to do the deed.\"    Therewith they call him to them, and offer him gold and great dominion,  as they well have might to do. Yea, and they took a certain worm and  somewhat of wolf's flesh and let seethe them together, and gave him to  eat of the same, even as the singer sings--         \"Fish of the wild-wood,       Worm smooth crawling,       With wolf-meat mingled,       They minced for Guttorm;       Then in the beaker,       In the wine his mouth knew,       They set it, still doing       More deeds of wizards.    Wherefore with the eating of this meat he grew so wild and eager, and  with all things about him, and with the heavy words of Grimhild, that  he gave his word to do the deed; and mighty honour they promised him in  reward thereof.    But of these evil wiles naught at all knew Sigurd, for he might not deal  with his shapen fate, nor the measure of his life-days, neither deemed  he that he was worthy of such things at their hands.    So Guttorm went in to Sigurd the next morning as he lay upon his bed,  yet durst he not do aught against him, but shrank back out again; yea,  and even so he fared a second time, for so bright and eager were the  eyes of Sigurd that few durst look upon him. But the third time he went  in, and there lay Sigurd asleep; then Guttorm drew his sword and thrust  Sigurd through in such wise that the sword point smote into the bed  beneath him; then Sigurd awoke with that wound, and Guttorm gat him unto  the door; but therewith Sigurd caught up the sword Gram, and cast it  after him, and it smote him on the back, and struck him asunder in the  midst, so that the feet of him fell one way, and the head and hands back  into the chamber.    Now Gudrun lay asleep on Sigurd's bosom, but she woke up unto woe that  may not be told of, all swimming in the blood of him, and in such wise  did she bewail her with weeping and words of sorrow, that Sigurd rose up  on the bolster, and spake.    \"Weep not,\" said he, \"for thy brothers live for thy delight; but a young  son have I, too young to be ware of his foes; and an ill turn have these  played against their own fortune; for never will they get a mightier  brother-in-law to ride abroad with them; nay, nor a better son to their  sister, than this one, if he may grow to man's estate. Lo, now is that  come to pass which was foretold me long ago, but from mine eyes has it  been hidden, for none may fight against his fate and prevail. Behold  this has Brynhild brought to pass, even she who loves me before all  men; but this may I swear, that never have I wrought ill to Gunnar, but  rather have ever held fast to my oath with him, nor was I ever too much  a friend to his wife. And now if I had been forewarned, and had been  afoot with my weapons, then should many a man have lost his life or  ever I had fallen, and all those brethren should have been slain, and  a harder work would the slaying of me have been than the slaying of the  mightiest bull or the mightiest boar of the wild-wood.\"    And even therewithal life left the King; but Gudrun moaned and drew  a weary breath, and Brynhild heard it, and laughed when she heard her  moaning.    Then said Gunnar, \"Thou laughest not because thy heart-roots are  gladdened, or else why doth thy visage wax so wan? Sure an evil creature  thou art; most like thou art nigh to thy death! Lo now, how meet would  it be for thee to behold thy brother Atli slain before thine eyes, and  that thou shouldst stand over him dead; whereas we must needs now  stand over our brother-in-law in such a case, our brother-in-law and our  brother's bane.\"    She answered, \"None need mock at the measure of slaughter being  unfulfilled; yet heedeth not Atli your wrath or your threats; yea, he  shall live longer than ye, and be a mightier man.\"    Hogni spake and said, \"Now hath come to pass the soothsaying of  Brynhild; an ill work not to be atoned for.\"    And Gudrun said, \"My kinsmen have slain my husband; but ye, when ye next  ride to the war and are come into the battle, then shall ye look about  and see that Sigurd is neither on the right hand nor the left, and ye  shall know that he was your good-hap and your strength; and if he  had lived and had sons, then should ye have been strengthened by his  offspring and his kin.\"        CHAPTER XXXI. Of the Lamentation of Gudrun over Sigurd dead, as it is  told told in ancient Songs. (1)         Gudrun of old days       Drew near to dying       As she sat in sorrow       Over Sigurd;       Yet she sighed not       Nor smote hand on hand,       Nor wailed she aught       As other women.         Then went earls to her.       Full of all wisdom,       Fain help to deal       To her dreadful heart:       Hushed was Gudrun       Of wail, or greeting,       But with a heavy woe       Was her heart a-breaking.         Bright and fair       Sat the great earls' brides,       Gold arrayed       Before Gudrun;       Each told the tale       Of her great trouble,       The bitterest bale       She erst abode.         Then spake Giaflaug,       Giuki's sister:       \"Lo upon earth       I live most loveless       Who of five mates       Must see the ending,       Of daughters twain       And three sisters,       Of brethren eight,       And abide behind lonely.\"         Naught gat Gudrun       Of wail and greeting,       So heavy was she       For her dead husband,       So dreadful-hearted       For the King laid dead there.         Then spake Herborg       Queen of Hunland--       \"Crueller tale       Have I to tell of,       Of my seven sons       Down in the Southlands,       And the eighth man, my mate,       Felled in the death-mead.         \"Father and mother,       And four brothers,       On the wide sea       The winds and death played with;       The billows beat       On the bulwark boards.         \"Alone must I sing o'er them,       Alone must I array them,       Alone must my hands deal with       Their departing;       And all this was       In one season's wearing,       And none was left       For love or solace.         \"Then was I bound       A prey of the battle,       When that same season       Wore to its ending;       As a tiring may       Must I bind the shoon       Of the duke's high dame,       Every day at dawning.         \"From her jealous hate       Gat I heavy mocking,       Cruel lashes       She laid upon me,       Never met I       Better master       Or mistress worser       In all the wide world.\"         Naught gat Gudrun       Of wail or greeting,       So heavy was she       For her dead husband,       So dreadful-hearted       For the King laid dead there.         Then spake Gullrond,       Giuki's daughter--       \"O foster-mother,       Wise as thou mayst be,       Naught canst thou better       The young wife's bale.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11523"],[0,"Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press (#20)"],[1,"in trouble too.    Officially, my job at the Herald, by this time, was  being part of the Goa desk. On a few occasions, the  news editor and the editor discovered that I was going  all the way to Fatorda, 40 Kms from Panjim, to watch  the National Football League. Soon enough, I got a  'goonish absurdism' from the editor asking why action  should not be taken against Mr Visvas Paul for  'subsidising' work. There were two or three points with  which I was accused, one among those was that I had  defied the News Editor Sergio Caldeira. I denied  everything in a written reply. What they did not reckon  was that I would sincerely came back from the football  match, and complete my day's work, which was doing the  Goa page. But seniors later did not have any qualms  about accompanying Choppy and me for an important match  during working hours. What's more, after coming back  from the match, he even helped me complete the page!    Doing a Goa page was the dreariest thing on the desk,  because, of the kind of stories that landed in from the  correspondents.    Stringers used to send three or four pages of  hand-written foolscape papers, which, when edited,  turned out to be just single column stories. I wonder  how the scene is now. In those days, there was no  re-writing desk and the sub-editors had to do all the  dirty work of re-writing, editing and making a page. It  was a tough job but it improved one's editing skills  and my patience and perseverance too. So how could one  be blamed for opting to take a few hours for a harmless  passion like watching a football match? I footed hefty  petrol bills for this by the way, but could not claim  the travelling allowance.    One's desk job also threw up some funny situations.    For one, there was the traditional rivalry between  sub-editors and reporters -- an unpalatable and  unacknowledgeable fact to many. In the Herald, we had  another kind of rivalry. This running feud was between  compositors and sub-editors on the Goa desk. The  intensity of this feud became more pronounced during  the night shifts. It used to turn into a bitter fight  complete with the usage of the choicest abuses  available.    Department of Information press notes (trust the  politicos and their wise words of wisdom to have a hand  in any kind of fight) and hard copies sent by stringers  were the cause. The compositors used to concentrate on  composing advertisement, after reporting to work  regularly irregular, while we sub-editors breathed down  on their necks to type our stories which were our  life-line to fill the page. I think that Herald was the  only place which recruited an assortment of a  government servant, wannabe-advocate and a shoe-shop  vendor as compositors.    In short, Herald became their heart break club.    Mehboob was one of the finest composer we had, although  he could not discern the difference between bail and  jail. One night shift, I gave him a faxed copy from  Margao bureau filed by Minoo Fernandes. It was a court  case and Radharao Gracias was the advocate for a  defendant. Our man, Mehboob, usually is deadpan on the  keyboard but that particular day, he finished it on  time. When I opened the copy, suddenly, the story  seemed to be different from what I had read earlier.  Wondering whether I got my story wrong, I rechecked the  hard copy and found that apparently, Mehboob misread  the surname of Radharao wrongly and so it read like  Advocate Radharao Greasiness instead of Gracias. From  that day onwards, I opened a new file called 'MTV  Enjoy' and stored all the bloomers of composed copies,  courtesy Mehboob.    This same guy, during the Lent season, decided to skip  work on Maundy Thursday, because someone told him that  Good Friday fell on Thursday that particular year. All  said and done, Mehboob was a sweet guy because he would  come with delicious beef kebabs for all of us during  Ramzan evenings.    Talking of bloomers, readers of the Herald newspaper  would have had an early morning wire trip one morning  if this one hadn't been detected just in time. The  edition was put to bed, and the customary good-nights  were done with. At that time, there was a process known  as spooling, in which Page 1 was printed on a film  paper to do away with the 'hazards' of cut and paste  process. The Linotype operator was an apology of a man,  most of the time reeking of a combination of the local  urrak or feni and ghutka. The chief sub sent the page  for spooling and left. Before I signed off from the  office, I just happened to go to the plate making  section to see how my page was shaping up and just  glanced at Page 1 which was spooled and ready for  plate-making. Lo and behold, yesterday's front page was  gloriously laid out on the pasting grid and ready for  plate-making. Even the pasters did not realise the  mistake as the advertisement for that particular day  was the same size as the previous days. Our Linotype  operator spooled yesterday's page and sent it for  plate-making. I gave him a big dressing down but did  not report it to anybody as he begged me not to do so.    Talking of the pasters, Umesh, a big bull of a guy was  my 'best friend' as he always liked to trouble me by  going to sleep just as I finished page 3 and brought it  up for cut pasting on the grid. Somehow, our animosity  made us wary of each other and we developed a mutual  respect. Despite numerous complaints by the chief-subs  about his behaviour, he remained non-chalant as he did  not expect the powers that be to take any action on him.    I guess that this attitude for disregard towards people  in power is all prevalent and all pervasive in society.  It is an universal truth that any law is meant to be  broken. As a corollary, frozen laws are enacted by the  government only in order to freeze some people, though  these laws are hardly taken out of the freezer and  defrosted. A case in point is the anti-smoking and  anti-spitting law decreed in Goa with much fanfare and  welcomed by many quarters. One aspect which was raised  by noted anti-tobacco activist Dr Sharad Vaidya, was  how effectively would the anti-smoking law be enforced  in the State. A valid point which I had raised with the  then Chief Minister Francisco Sardinha. He said on  record that it was difficult to implement. He also  admitted that there are always those who want to defy  the law.    Rules are there on which the government seems to suffer  from selective amnesia, because they are unable to  implement in the right spirit as they have no clue as  to how to go about it. When the High Court gave an  order banning loud music after 10 pm based on a  complaint by the environmentalists, Choppy and me wrote  a series of articles for Insight analysing in depth,  the pros and cons.    One point that had us puzzled was from ought the sound  to be measured. At its source, or from the point where  the complaint was made. Obviously, the authorities  could not place their sound-metres at the mouth of a  10,000 watt music speaker and say the decibel level  were high. When pointed out, the Secretary of the Goa  State Pollution Control Board talked greek. For that  matter, we discovered that the pollution control board  was not even equipped with proper sound-metres. Neither  could the government come in defence of the music  industry and allied activities like the night clubs  which depended on music and entertainment to draw  tourists to Goa.    After the much touted and much publicised millennium  rave party by Mumbai tycoon Jay Wadia was banned by the  High Court in December 1999, I was witness to two rave  parties in January 2000, though on a smaller scale, but  where the corruption by the police was displayed in its  full naked glory nonetheless. At one rave party at  Bamboo Forest in Anjuna, instead of stopping the party,  the police arrived, collected their share and left the  place as unobtrusively as they came. They were blind to  the open sale of drugs and were deaf to the raves'  sound pollution which carried on well past midnight  into the wee hours of the morning.    Another rave party also organised near Anjuna was  completely insulated against police harassment. Such  was the extent of influence asserted by the organisers  of this rave party that the police just turned a deaf  ear to phone calls made by Choppy and me just to check  how much the police is interested in enforcing the law.  We do not know whether money had changed hands but when  we did not get any response to the repeated phone calls  we made to the nearest police station we personally  went to speak to the police officer on duty -- but to  our horror found the police station was closed, lock  stock and barrel, as deserted as a place hit by a  typhoon. But our labour was not in vain. Next day, this  was in February 2000, Ashley ran an exclusive report on  the front page based on our first hand account. But the  surprising part was the way the DySP North Goa denied  everything, including our calls and visit to the police station.    My days in Herald are truly memorable. Along the way I  did trample on a few toes inadvertently, but my well  wishers and the learning tips they provided me are  invaluable. Any memories I carry of Herald must be  painted with the pictures of Choppy, Rico and Ashley,  who contributed greatly to my development as a  journalist. I can safely include this trio into the  list of the other great people like Devika Sequeira,  Pamela, Derek Almeida about whom I have heard a lot.    I guess, the journalistic calibre of the above  mentioned people and their attitude of being go-getters  rubbed off onto people like me. The excitement of  running after news, rather than waiting for news to  land in the form of press notes or government  hand-outs, is a different ball-game altogether. It was  a question of being there first which I liked most in  Herald. During the police firing incident at Cortalim  on the anti-Meta"]]]
