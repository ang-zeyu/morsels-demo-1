On the 23rd,[1] we came on nine miles to Sangrampur, and, on the  24th, nine more to the valley of Jabera,[2] situated on the western  extremity of the bed of a large lake, which is now covered by twenty-  four villages. The waters were kept in by a large wall that united  two hills about four miles south of Jabera. This wall was built of  great cut freestone blocks from the two hills of the Vindhiya range,  which it united. It was about half a mile long, one hundred feet  broad at the base, and about one hundred feet high. The stones,  though cut, were never, apparently, cemented; and the wall has long  given way in the centre, through which now falls a small stream that  passes from east to west of what was once the bottom of the lake, and  now is the site of so many industrious and happy little village  communities.[3] The proprietor of the village of Jabera, in whose  mango grove our tents were pitched, conducted me to the ruins of the  wall; and told me that it had been broken down by the order of the  Emperor Aurangzeb.[4] History to these people is all a fairy tale;  and this emperor is the great destroyer of everything that the  Muhammadans in their fanaticism have demolished of the Hindoo  sculpture or architecture; and yet, singular as it may appear, they  never mention his name with any feelings of indignation or hatred.  With every scene of his supposed outrage against their gods or their  temples, there is always associated the recollection of some instance  of his piety, and the Hindoos' glory--of some idol, for instance, or  column, preserved from his fury by a miracle, whose divine origin he  is supposed at once to have recognized with all due reverence.     At Bheragarh,[5] the high priest of the temple told us that  Aurangzeb and his soldiers knocked off the heads, arms, and noses of  all the idols, saying that 'if they had really any of the godhead in  them, they would assuredly now show it, and save themselves'. But  when they came to the door of Gauri Sankar's apartments, they were  attacked by a nest of hornets, that put the whole of the emperor's  army to the rout; and his imperial majesty called out: 'Here we have  really something like a god, and we shall not suffer him to be  molested; if all your gods could give us proof like this of their  divinity, not a nose of them would ever be touched'.    The popular belief, however, is that after Aurangzeb's army had  struck off all the prominent features of the other gods, one of the  soldiers entered the temple, and struck off the ear of one of the  prostrate images underneath their vehicle, the Bull. 'My dear', said  Gauri, 'do you see what these saucy men are about?' Her consort  turned round his head;[6] and, seeing the soldiers around him,  brought all the hornets up from the marble rocks below, where there  are still so many nests of them, and the whole army fled before them  to Teori, five miles.[7] It is very likely that some body of troops  by whom the rest of the images had been mutilated, may have been  driven off by a nest of hornets from within the temple where this  statue stands. I have seen six companies of infantry, with a train of  artillery and a squadron of horse, all put to the rout by a single  nest of hornets, and driven off some miles with all their horses and  bullocks. The officers generally save themselves by keeping within  their tents, and creeping under their bed-clothes, or their carpets;  and servants often escape by covering themselves up in their  blankets, and lying perfectly still. Horses are often stung to a  state of madness, in which they throw themselves over precipices and  break their limbs, or kill themselves. The grooms, in trying to save  their horses, are generally the people who suffer most in a camp  attacked by such an enemy. I have seen some so stung as to recover  with difficulty; and I believe there have been instances of people  not recovering at all. In such a frightful scene I have seen a  bullock sitting and chewing the cud as calmly as if the whole thing  had been got up for his amusement. The hornets seldom touch any  animal that remains perfectly still.    On the bank of the Bina river at Eran, in the Sagar district, is a  beautiful pillar of a single freestone, more than fifty feet high,  surmounted by a figure of Krishna, with the glory round his head.[8]  Some few of the rays of this glory have been struck off by lightning;  but the people declare that this was done by a shot fired at it from  a cannon by order of Aurangzeb, as his army was marching by on its  way to the Deccan. Before the scattered fragments, however, could  reach the ground, the air was filled, they say, by a swarm of  hornets, that put  the whole army to flight; and the emperor ordered his gunners to  desist, declaring that he was 'satisfied of the presence of the god'.  There is hardly any part of India in which, according to popular  belief, similar miracles were not worked to convince the emperor of  the peculiar merits or sanctity of particular idols or temples,  according to the traditions of the people, derived, of course, from  the inventions of priests. I should mention that these hornets  suspend their nests to the branches of the highest trees, under  rocks, or in old deserted temples. Native travellers, soldiers, and  camp followers, cook and eat their food under such trees; but they  always avoid one in which there is a nest of hornets, particularly on  a still day. Sometimes they do not discover the nest till it is too  late. The unlucky wight goes on feeding his fire, and delighting in  the prospect of the feast before him, as the smoke ascends in curling  eddies to the nest of the hornets. The moment it touches them they  sally forth and descend, and sting like mad creatures every living  thing they find in motion. Three companies of my regiment were  escorting treasure in boats from Allahabad to Cawnpore for the army  under the Marquis of Hastings, in 1817.[9] The soldiers all took  their dinners on shore every day; and one still afternoon a sipahi  (sepoy), by cooking his dinner under one of those nests without  seeing it, sent the infuriated swarm among the whole of his comrades,  who were cooking in the same grove, and undressed, as they always are  on such occasions. Treasure, food, and all were immediately deserted,  and the whole of the party, save the European officers, were up to  their noses in the river Ganges. The hornets hovered over them; and  it was amusing to see them bobbing their heads under as the insects  tried to pounce upon them. The officers covered themselves up in the  carpets of their boats; and, as the day was a hot one, their  situation was still more uncomfortable than that of the men. Darkness  alone put an end to the conflict.    I should mention that the poor old Rani, or Queen of Garha, Lachhmi  Kuar, came out as far as Katangi with us to take leave of my wife, to  whom she has always been attached. She had been in the habit of  spending a day with her at my house once a week; and being the only  European lady from whom she had ever received any attention, or  indeed ever been on terms of any intimacy with, she feels the more  sensible of the little offices of kindness and courtesy she has  received from her.[10] Her husband, Narhar Sa, was the last of the  long line of sixty-two sovereigns who reigned over these territories  from the year A.D. 358 to the Sagar conquest, A.D. 1781.[11] He died  a prisoner in the fortress of Kurai, in the Sagar district, in A. D.  1789, leaving two widows.[12] One burnt herself upon the funeral  pile, and the other was prevented from doing so, merely because she  was thought too young, as she was not then fifteen years of age. She  received a small pension from the Sagar Government, which was still  further reduced under the Nagpur Government which succeeded it in the  Jubbulpore district in which the pension had been assigned; and it  was not thought necessary to increase the amount of this pension when  the territory came under our dominion,[13] so that she has had barely  enough to subsist upon, about one hundred rupees a month. She is now  about sixty years of age, and still a very good-looking woman. In her  youth she must have been beautiful. She does not object to appear  unveiled before gentlemen on any particular occasion; and, when Lord  W. Bentinck was at Jubbulpore in 1833, I introduced, the old queen to  him. He seemed much interested, and ordered the old lady a pair of  shawls. None but very coarse ones were found in the store-rooms of  the Governor-General's representative, and his lordship said these  were not such as a Governor-General could present, or a queen,  however poor, receive; and as his own 'toshakhana' (wardrobe) had  gone on,[l4] he desired that a pair of the finest kind should be  purchased and presented to her in his name. The orders were given in  her presence and mine. I was obliged to return to Sagar before they  could be carried into effect; and, when I returned in 1835,[15] I  found that the _rejected_ shawls had been presented to her, and were  such coarse things that she was ashamed to wear them, as much, I  really believe, on account of the exalted person who had given them,  as her own. She never mentioned the subject till I asked her to let  me see the shawls, which she did reluctantly, and she was too proud  to complain. How the good intentions of the Governor-General had been  frustrated in this case I have never learned. The native officer in  charge of the store was dead, and the Governor-General's  representative had left the place. Better could not, I suppose, be  got at this time, and he did not like to defer giving them.      Notes:    1. November, 1835.    2.

The mere  energy lost through slow hand-work in those times, if transformed into  electrical power, would probably have run all the mills and factories in  America previous to 1800.    There is a decided tendency among modern housewives to take a hostile  view of the ever recurring task of preparing food for the family; but if  these housewives were compelled suddenly to revert to the method and  amount of cooking of colonial days, there would be universal rebellion.  Apparently indigestion was little known among the colonists--at least  among the men, and the amount of heavy food consumed by the average  individual is astounding to the modern reader. The caterer's bill for a  banquet given by the corporation of New York to Lord Cornberry may help  us to realize the gastronomic ability of our ancestors:                       \"Mayor ... Dr.    To a piece of beef and cabbage,    To a dish of tripe and cowheel    To a leg of pork and turnips    To 2 puddings    To a surloyn of beef    To a turkey and onions    To a leg mutton and pickles    To a dish chickens    To minced pyes    To fruit, cheese, bread, etc.    To butter for sauce    To dressing dinner,    To 31 bottles wine    To beer and syder.\"    We must remember, moreover, that the greater part of all food consumed  in a family was prepared through its every stage by that family. No  factory-canned goods, no ready-to-warm soups, no evaporated fruits, no  potted meats stood upon the grocers' shelves as a very present help in  time of need. On the farm or plantation and even in the smaller towns  the meat was raised, slaughtered, and cured at home, the wheat, oats,  and corn grown, threshed, and frequently made into flour and meal by the  family, the fruit dried or preserved by the housewife. Molasses, sugar,  spices, and rum might be imported from the West Indies, but the everyday  foods must come from the local neighborhood, and through the hard manual  efforts of the consumer. An old farmer declared in the _American  Museum_ in 1787: \"At this time my farm gave me and my whole family a  good living on the produce of it, and left me one year with another one  hundred and fifty silver dollars, for I never spent more than ten  dollars a year, which was for salt, nails, and the like. Nothing to eat,  drink or wear was bought, as my farm provided all.\"    The very building of a fire to cook the food was a laborious task with  flint and steel, one generally avoided by never allowing the embers on  the family hearth to die. Fire was indeed a precious gift in that day,  and that the methods sometimes used in obtaining it were truly  primitive, may be conjectured from the following extract from Prince's  _Annals of New England_: \"April 21, 1631. The house of John Page of  Waterton burnt by carrying a few coals from one house to another. A coal  fell by the way and kindled the leaves.\"[85]    Over those great fire-places of colonial times many a wife presented  herself as a burnt offering to her lord and master, the goodman of the  house. The pots and kettles that ornamented the kitchen walls were  implements for pre-historic giants rather than for frail women. The  brass or copper kettles often holding fifteen gallons, and the huge iron  pots weighing forty pounds, were lugged hither and thither by women  whose every ounce of strength was needed for the too frequent pangs of  child-birth. The colonists boasted of the number of generations a kettle  would outlast; but perhaps the generations were too short--thanks to the  size of the kettle.    And yet with such cumbersome utensils, the good wives of all the  colonies prepared meals that would drive the modern cook to distraction.  Hear these eighteenth century comments on Philadelphia menus:         \"This plain Friend [Miers Fisher, a young Quaker lawyer], with       his plain but pretty wife with her Thees and Thous, had provided       us a costly entertainment: ducks, hams, chickens, beef, pig,       tarts, creams, custards, jellies, fools, trifles, floating       islands, beer, porter, punch, wine and along, etc.\"         \"At the home of Chief Justice Chew. About four o'clock we were       called to dinner. Turtle and every other thing, flummery,       jellies, sweetmeats of twenty sorts, trifles, whipped sillabubs,       floating islands, fools, etc., with a dessert of fruits, raisins,       almonds, pears, peaches.         \"A most sinful feast again! everything which could delight the       eye or allure the taste; curds and creams, jellies, sweetmeats of       various sorts, twenty kinds of tarts, fools, trifles, floating       islands, whipped sillabubs, etc. Parmesan cheese, punch, wine,       porter, beer.\"[86]    To be a housewife in colonial days evidently required the strength of  Hercules, the skill of Tubal Cain, and the patience of Job. Such an  advertisement as that appearing in the _Pennsylvania Packet_ of  September 23, 1780, was not an exceptional challenge to female  ingenuity and perseverance:    \"Wanted at a Seat about half a day's journey from Philadelphia, on  which are good improvements and domestics, A single Woman of unsullied  Reputation, an affiable, cheerful, active and amiable Disposition;  cleanly, industrious, perfectly qualified to direct and manage the  female Concerns of country business, as raising small stock, dairying,  marketing, combing, carding, spinning, knitting, sewing, pickling,  preserving, etc., and occasionally to instruct two Young Ladies in  those Branches of Oeconomy, who, with their father, compose the  Family. Such a person will be treated with respect and esteem, and  meet with every encouragement due to such a character.\"    It is apparent that besides the work now commonly carried on in the  household, colonial women performed many a duty now abrogated to the  factory. In fact, so far are we removed from the industrial customs of  the era that many of the terms then common in every home have lost all  meaning for the average modern housewife. For nearly two centuries the  greater part of the preparation of material for clothing was done by the  family; the spinning, the weaving, the dyeing, the making of thread,  these and many similar domestic activities preceded the fashion of a  garment. When we remember that the sewing machine was unknown we may  comprehend to some extent the immense amount of labor performed by women  and girls of those early days. The possession of many slaves or servants  offered but little if any relief; for such ownership involved, of  course, the manufacture of additional clothing. Humphreys in her  _Catherine Schuyler_ presents this quotation commenting upon a skilled  housewife: \"Notwithstanding they have so large a family to regulate  (from 50 to 60 blacks) Mrs. Schuyler seeth to the Manufacturing of  suitable Cloathing for all her family, all of which is the produce of  her plantation in which she is helped by her Mama & Miss Polly and the  whole is done with less Combustion & noise than in many Families who  have not more than 4 or 5 Persons in the whole Family.\"      _IV. Domestic Pride_    Of course the well-to-do Americans of the eighteenth century at length  adopted the custom of importing the finer cloth, silk, satin and  brocade; but after the middle of the century the anti-British sentiment  impelled even the wealthiest either to make or to buy the coarser  American cloth. Indeed, it became a matter of genuine pride to many a  patriotic dame that she could thus use the spinning wheel in behalf of  her country. Daughters of Liberty, having agreed to drink no tea and to  wear no garments of foreign make, had spinning circles similar to the  quilting bees of later days, and it was no uncommon sight between 1770  and 1785 to see groups of women, carrying spinning wheels through the  streets, going to such assemblies. See this bit of description of such a  meeting held at Rowley, Massachusetts: \"A number of thirty-three  respectable ladies of the town met at sunrise with their wheels to spend  the day at the house of the Rev'd Jedekiah Jewell, in the laudable  design of a spinning match. At an hour before sunset, the ladies there  appearing neatly dressed, principally in homespun, a polite and generous  repast of American production was set for their entertainment....\"[87]    If the modern woman had to labor for clothing as did her  great-great-grandmother, styles in dress would become astonishingly  simple. After the spinning and weaving, the cloth was dyed or  bleached, and this in itself was a task to try the fortitude of a  strong soul. Toward the middle of the eighteenth century the  importation of silks and finer materials somewhat lessened this form  of work; but even through the first decade of the nineteenth century  spinning and weaving continued to be a part of the work of many a  household. The Revolution, as we have seen, gave a new impetus to this  art, and the first ladies of the land proudly exhibited their skill.  As Wharton remarks in her _Martha Washington_: \"Mrs. Washington, who  would not have the heart to starve her direst foe within her own  gates, heartily co-operated with her husband and his colleagues. The  spinning wheels and carding and weaving machines were set to work with  fresh spirit at Mt. Vernon.... Some years later, in New Jersey, Mrs.  Washington told a friend that she often kept sixteen spinning wheels  in constant operation, and at one time Lund Washington spoke of a  larger number. Two of her own dresses of cotton striped with silk Mrs.  Washington showed with great pride, explaining that the silk stripes  in the fabrics were made from the ravellings of brown silk stockings  and old crimson damask chair covers. Her coachman, footman, and maid  were all attired in domestic cloth, except the coachman's scarlet  cuffs,"]]]
