On seeing  us halt, the elephant raised his head, reconnoitred us for a moment,  then flung down the timber, and voluntarily forced himself backwards  among the brushwood so as to leave a passage, of which he expected us to  avail ourselves. My horse hesitated: the elephant observed it, and  impatiently thrust himself deeper into the jungle, repeating his cry of  _urmph!_ but in a voice evidently meant to encourage us to advance.  Still the horse trembled; and anxious to observe the instinct of the two  sagacious animals, I forbore any interference: again the elephant of his  own accord wedged himself further in amongst the trees, and manifested  some impatience that we did not pass him. At length the horse moved  forward; and when we were fairly past, I saw the wise creature stoop and  take up its heavy burthen, trim and balance it on its tusks, and resume  its route as before, hoarsely snorting its discontented remonstrance.    Between the African elephant and that of Ceylon, with the exception of  the striking peculiarity of the infrequency of tusks in the latter, the  distinctions are less apparent to a casual observer than to a scientific  naturalist. In the Ceylon species the forehead is higher and more  hollow, the ears are smaller, and, in a section of the teeth, the  grinding ridges, instead of being lozenge-shaped, are transverse bars of  uniform breadth.    The Indian elephant is stated by Cuvier to have four nails on the hind  foot, the African variety having only three: but amongst the perfections  of a high-bred elephant of Ceylon, is always enumerated the possession  of _twenty_ nails, whilst those of a secondary class have but eighteen  in all.[1]    [Footnote 1: See Chapter on Mammalia, p. 60.]    So conversant are the natives with the structure and \"points\" of the  elephant, that they divide them readily into castes, and describe with  particularity their distinctive excellences and defects. In the  _Hastisilpe_, a Singhalese work which treats of their management, the  marks of inferior breeding are said to be \"eyes restless like those of a  crow, the hair of the head of mixed shades; the face wrinkled; the  tongue curved and black; the nails short and green; the ears small; the  neck thin, the skin freckled; the tail without a tuft, and the  fore-quarter lean and low:\" whilst the perfection of form and beauty is  supposed to consist in the \"softness of the skin, the red colour of the  mouth and tongue, the forehead expanded and hollow, the ears broad and  rectangular, the trunk broad at the root and blotched with pink in  front; the eyes bright and kindly, the cheeks large, the neck full, the  back level, the chest square, the fore legs short and convex in front,  the hind quarter plump, and five nails on each foot, all smooth,  polished, and round.[1] An elephant with these perfections,\" says the  author of the _Hastisilpe_, \"will impart glory and magnificence to the  king; but he cannot be discovered amongst thousands, yea, there shall  never be found an elephant clothed at once with _all_ the excellences  herein described.\" The \"points\" of an elephant are to be studied with  the greatest advantage in those attached to the temples, which are  always of the highest caste, and exhibit the most perfect breeding.    [Footnote 1: A native of rank informed me, that \"the tail of a  high-caste elephant will sometimes touch the ground, but such are very  rare.\"]    The colour of the animal's skin in a state of nature is generally of a  lighter brown than that of those in captivity; a distinction which  arises, in all probability, not so much from the wild animal's  propensity to cover itself with mud and dust, as from the superior care  which is taken in repeatedly bathing the tame ones, and in rubbing their  skins with a soft stone, a lump of burnt clay, or the coarse husk of a  coco-nut. This kind of attention, together with the occasional  application of oil, gives rise to the deeper black which the hides of  the latter present.    Amongst the native Singhalese, however, a singular preference is evinced  for elephants that exhibit those flesh-coloured blotches which  occasionally mottle the skin of an elephant, chiefly about the head and  extremities. The front of the trunk, the tips of the ears, the forehead,  and occasionally the legs, are thus diversified with stains of a  yellowish tint, inclining to pink. These are not natural; nor are they  hereditary, for they are seldom exhibited by the younger individuals in  a herd, but appear to be the result of some eruptive affection, the  irritation of which has induced the animal in its uneasiness to rub  itself against the rough bark of trees, and thus to destroy the outer  cuticle.[1]    [Footnote 1: This is confirmed by the fact that the scar of the ancle  wound, occasioned by the rope on the legs of those which have been  captured by noosing, presents precisely the same tint in the healed  parts.]    To a European these spots appear blemishes, and the taste that leads the  natives to admire them is probably akin to the feeling that has at all  times rendered a _white elephant_ an object of wonder to Asiatics. The  rarity of the latter is accounted for by regarding this peculiar  appearance as the result of albinism; and notwithstanding the  exaggeration of Oriental historians, who compare the fairness of such  creatures to the whiteness of snow, even in its utmost perfection, I  apprehend that the tint of a white elephant is little else than a  flesh-colour, rendered somewhat more conspicuous by the blanching of the  skin, and the lightness of the colourless hairs by which it is sparsely  covered. A white elephant is mentioned in the _Mahawanso_ as forming  part of the retinue attached to the \"Temple of the Tooth\" at  Anarajapoora, in the fifth century after Christ[1]; but it commanded no  religious veneration, and like those in the stud of the kings of Siam,  it was tended merely as an emblem of royalty[2]; the sovereign of Ceylon  being addressed as the \"Lord of Elephants.\"[3] In 1633 a white elephant  was exhibited in Holland[4]; but as this was some years before the Dutch  had established themselves firmly in Ceylon, it was probably brought  from some other of their eastern possessions.    [Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 254, A.D. 433.]    [Footnote 2: PALLEGOIX, _Siam, &c._, vol. i. p. 152.]    [Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xviii. p. 111.

Milit. des Elephants_, lib. ii. c. x. p.  380. HORACE mentions a white elephant as having been exhibited at Rome:  \"Sive elephas albus vulgi converteret ora.\"--HOR. _Ep_. II. 196.]          CHAP. III.    THE ELEPHANT.           *       *       *       *       *    _Habits when Wild_.    Although found generally in warm and sunny climates, it is a mistake to  suppose that the elephant is partial either to heat or to light. In  Ceylon, the mountain tops, and not the sultry valleys, are its favourite  resort. In Oovah, where the elevated plains are often crisp with the  morning frost, and on Pedura-talla-galla, at the height of upwards of  eight thousand feet, they are found in herds, whilst the hunter may  search for them without success in the hot jungles of the low country.  No altitude, in fact, seems too lofty or too chill for the elephant,  provided it affords the luxury of water in abundance; and, contrary to  the general opinion that the elephant delights in sunshine, it seems at  all times impatient of glare, and spends the day in the thickest depth  of the forests, devoting the night to excursions, and to the luxury of  the bath, in which it also indulges occasionally by day. This partiality  for shade is doubtless ascribable to the animal's love of coolness and  solitude; but it is not altogether unconnected with the position of the  eye, and the circumscribed use which its peculiar mode of life permits  it to make of the faculty of sight.    All the elephant hunters and natives to whom I have spoken on the  subject, concur in opinion that its range of vision is circumscribed,  and that it relies more on its ear and sense of smell than on its sight,  which is liable to be obstructed by dense foliage; besides which, from  the formation of its short neck, the elephant is incapable of directing  the range of the eye much above the level of the head.[1]    [Footnote 1: After writing the above, I was permitted by the late Dr.  HARRISON, of Dublin, to see some accurate drawings of the brain of an  elephant, which he had the opportunity of dissecting in 1847; and on  looking to that of the base, I have found a remarkable verification of  the information which I collected in Ceylon.    The small figure A is the ganglion of the fifth nerve, showing the small  motor and large sensitive portion.    [Illustration]    The _olfactory lobes_, from which the olfactory nerves proceed, are  large, whilst the _optic and muscular nerves of the orbit are singularly  small_ for so vast an animal; and one is immediately struck by the  prodigious size of the fifth nerve, which supplies the proboscis with  its exquisite sensibility, as well as by the great size of the motor  portion of the seventh, which supplies the same organ with its power of  movement and action.]    The elephant's small range of vision is sufficient to account for its  excessive caution, its alarm at unusual noises, and the timidity and  panic exhibited at trivial objects and incidents which, imperfectly  discerned, excite suspicions for its safety.[1] In 1841 an officer[2]  was chased by an elephant that he had slightly wounded. Seizing him near  the dry bed of a river, the animal had its forefoot already raised to  crush him; but its forehead being caught at the instant by the tendrils  of a climbing plant which had suspended itself from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#20)"],[1,"the back of the  high altar in a shrine, or feretory, dedicated to him.    [Illustration: TOMB ASSIGNED TO BISHOP RICHARD OF WYCH, AND PICTURES  ORIGINALLY BY BERNARDI. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., photo_.]    #Gilbert de Sancto Leophardo# (1288-1305) was a bishop who, like S.  Richard, devoted himself to his diocesan duties with a singleminded  purpose which was not a common virtue with all mediaeval prelates. He  endeavoured to regulate the habits of those clergy who accepted their  privileges but were inclined to neglect the duties and  responsibilities these involved. His interest in the fabric of the  cathedral was expressed principally by the additions that were made to  the lady-chapel during his episcopate.    #John Langton# (1305-1337) took a conspicuous part in the  suppression of the knights templars during the reign of Edward II. in  obedience to the papal order regarding them. He was Chancellor of the  Realm before his elevation to the episcopate, and showed his energy as  a statesman locally by commanding the restoration of rights to some  vicars of the cathedral who had been suspended in accordance with the  provisions of certain statutes which the dean and chapter made without  his consent. Like Bishop Gilbert, he was an instrument by whose  sanction more changes were made in the building.    #Robert of Stratford# (1337-1362), another statesman bishop,  succeeded Langton. He had also been chancellor, and asserted his  episcopal authority as sternly as his predecessor.    Of #William of Lynn# (1362-1368) and his episcopacy little record  remains; but    #William Rede# (1369-1385) earned some repute as a scholar, and was  the founder of Merton College Library in Oxford, and it is to him that  the diocese is indebted for the preservation of the early records  relating to the see. Nothing of importance is known of the next three  bishops:    #Thomas Rushoke# (1385-1389).    #Richard Metford# (1389-1395).    #Robert Waldby# (1395-1396).    #Robert Rede# (1397-1415), whose register is the earliest among  those that remain, occupied the see during the reign of Henry IV. This  record contains many interesting details concerning the part its  compiler took in the endeavour to suppress the doctrines of Wycliffe  and the Lollards; and it also shows that much disorder prevailed among  the canons and vicars of the cathedral. One of the canons, besides  stealing money from the treasury, appropriated for his private use  some materials which had been intended for the repair of the church.  Rectors of parishes allowed their cures to fall into a state of  destitution, and left them to the care of poorly paid vicars while  they themselves resided elsewhere. The see was not filled for two  years after the death of Rede. Then followed in succession:    #Stephen Patryngton# (1417).    #Henry Ware# (1418).    #John Kemp# (1421).    #Thomas Poldon# (1421).    #John Rickingale# (1426).    #Simon Sydenham# (1429).    No registers remain relating to the affairs of the episcopate during  the twenty years covered by their occupation of the see.    In the register left by #Richard Praty# (1438-1446) there is  evidence that many of the negligences censured by Bishop Rede were  still without correction. The discipline of the monastic houses in  Sussex is represented as having become very lax.    #Adam Moleyns#, or #Molyneux# (1446-1450), was instrumental in  arranging the marriage of Henry VI. with Margaret of Anjou. Many  concessions were granted to him by the king for the benefit of himself  and the diocese, but having become unpopular he was murdered by some  sailors in Portsmouth early in 1450 when on his way to France.    #Reginald Pecock# (1450-1459), \"being convicted of heresy, he  resigned his bishopric,\" so say the records of the cathedral.    #John Arundel# (1459-1478). The record of his episcopal  administration has been lost; but it is known that he built the screen  named after him. He appears, however, to have been much less restless  than his predecessor.    #Edward Storey# (1478-1503) has left in his register full accounts  of his deeds and the condition of the diocese. It shows the latter had  again become very disordered. Both the regular and secular bodies are  charged with abusing the trust committed to them. Bishop Storey tried  to correct this state of things. He proved his usefulness, otherwise,  by the foundation of the Prebendal, or Free Grammar-School, in  Chichester, and also by giving the Market Cross to the city for the  benefit of the poor.    Of #Richard Fitz-James# (1503-1508) and his administration there  is but little information.    With #Robert Sherburne# (1508-1536) we come to the close of a long  period of ecclesiastical history--one during which the distinctly  Christian, as opposed to the pagan, principles and forms of art had  been developed. As bishop at Chichester he represented the Church and  those principles which then in the west were taught in her name.  Accordingly he protested against \"the King's most dreadful commandment  concerning (with other things) the uniting of the Supreme head of the  Church of [? in] England with the Imperial Crown of this realm; and  also the abolishing and secluding out of this realm the enormities and  abuses of the Bishop of Rome's authority, usurped within the same.\" He  wrote thus in 1534 to Cromwell. And obeying this command from the  civil authority, he caused these orders to be published throughout the  diocese. As a subject he obeyed his king; but, being honest, he could  not as a bishop and a man disregard his principles when he found such  obedience involved their denial. Consequently he resigned the see in  1536.    #Richard Sampson# (1536-1543) took part in the Reformation  movement. Although he had defended the principle that the king was to  be considered \"high governor under God, and Supreme head of the Church  of England,\" his principles appear to have been easily affected by the  political weather that prevailed. His attitude in favour of every  principle involved in the acceptance of the papacy appears in the  support he gave to doctrines which had been rejected by the party of  reform. He no doubt feared the results that might follow upon another  attempt to adapt the Church's constitution to changed conditions.    In the time of #George Daye# (1543-1552) the pendulum moved again  across the face of the political and ecclesiastical clock. He was a  man whose convictions led him to support those same six articles which  had been upheld by Bishop Sampson; and he attempted to prevent the  introduction of the first prayer-book of Edward VI. in 1549, as well  as the destruction of the earlier service-books in the following year.  He was a man to be respected, for in the face of general opposition he  proved that his convictions on important affairs were not ready to  change at the sudden bidding of a new authority which he was unable to  recognise. As he was not to be persuaded that his position was wrong,  he was removed from the see towards the end of the year 1551. But we  meet him again presently, for Bishop #John Scory# (1552-1554), who  took his place, retired soon after Mary's accession. Bishop Daye came  back to favour, preached at the coronation, reoccupied the see, and  was now \"a mighty busy man.\" [37] He caused some recent orders to be  reversed by reviving the use of the earlier forms of liturgy,  restoring the older ceremonial, and again setting up those altars in  the churches which should never have been broken down. In his own  words Daye \"styeked\" not at things trivial; but he would not assent to  the abolition of essentials, however much they had been misused or  become offensive in the eyes of untutored civil dignitaries and their  party followers. Daye on his restoration had attempted to remove  reformers and their opinions from the diocese by the aid of faggots  and flames. But #John Christopherson# (1557-1559) was more  energetic in upholding his authority and ideas by this same means; for  Mary, though she would revive the papal supremacy, yet retained in her  own hands the ecclesiastical position which the Throne in England had  already assumed.      [37] Strype, quoted by Dean Stephens, p. 190.    At the close of Mary's reign Bishop Christopherson died, and in his  place Elizabeth put #William Barlow# (1559-1568), who had been  removed from the see of Bath and Wells by her predecessor. He made  some attempt to remove a variety of irregularities which had been  introduced since the death of Sherburne, for the services of the  Church had become much disordered in consequence of the many changes  of attitude which had been favoured by the rulers, both civil and  ecclesiastical, during nearly thirty years. Barlow's endeavour to  bring this chaos to a new order was in accord with the methods of  those who sought reform. He tried to carry out the injunction of  Parker, the Primate, whose aim was to \"reduce all to a Godly  uniformitie.\" But any desire for unity in diversity was not likely to  be satisfied unless it was sought for with at least some unanimity of  hope and aim. After his death the see remained vacant for two years.    #Richard Curteys# (1570-1583) found the revenues of his see so  reduced that he was unable properly to fulfil the ordinary obligations  of his position. He did not spare himself in his endeavour to do the  duties he had undertaken. With the assistance of others he  methodically instructed the diocese under his charge, an well was  this done that a contemporary said \"the people with ardent zeale,  wonderful rejoicinge, and in great number, take farre and long  journeys to be partakers of his good and godly lessons.\" [38]This  excellent man, however, owing to the political spoliation of the  church, died impoverished in 1583.
