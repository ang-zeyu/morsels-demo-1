[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#20)"],[1," is as yet an unconquered world waiting for its Alexander. There are  certain observable facts, viz., it prevails mostly near the arctic  circle rather than the pole; it takes on various forms--cloud-like,  arched, straight; it streams like banners, waves like curtains in  the wind, is inconstant; is either the cause or result of electric  disturbance; it is often from four hundred to six hundred miles  above the earth, while our air cannot be over one hundred miles.  It almost seems like a revelation to human eyes of those vast,  changeable, panoramic pictures by which the inhabitants of heaven  are taught.    [Illustration: Fig. 55.--The Aurora as Waving Curtains.]    Investigation has discovered far more mysteries than it has explained.  It is possible that the same cause that produces sun-spots produces  aurora in all space, visible in all worlds. If so, we shall see  more abundant auroras at the next maximum of sun-spot, between  1880-84.    _The Delicate Balance of Forces._    A soap-bubble in the wind could hardly be more flexible in form  and sensitive to influence than is the earth. On the morning of  May 9th, 1876, the earth's crust at Peru gave a few great throbs  upward, by the action of expansive gases within. The sea fled,  and returned in great waves as the land rose and fell. Then these  waves fled away over the great mobile surface, and in less than  five hours they had covered a space equal to half of Europe. The  waves ran out to the Sandwich Islands, six [Page 145] thousand  miles, at the rate of five hundred miles an hour, and arrived there  thirty feet high. They not only sped on in straight radial lines,  but, having run up the coast to California, were deflected away into  the former series of waves, making the most complex undulations.  Similar beats of the great heart of the earth have sent its pulses  as widely and rapidly on previous occasions.    The figure of the earth, even on the ocean, is irregular, in consequence  of the greater preponderance of land--and hence greater density--in the  northern hemisphere. These irregularities are often very perplexing  in making exact geodetic measurements. The tendency of matter to  fly from the centre by reason of revolution causes the equatorial  diameter to be twenty-six, miles longer than the polar one. By this  force the Mississippi River is enabled to run up a hill nearly  three miles high at a very rapid rate. Its mouth is that distance  farther from the centre of the earth than its source, when but  for this rotation both points would be equally distant.    If the water became more dense, or if the world were to revolve  faster, the oceans would rush to the equator, burying the tallest  mountains and leaving polar regions bare. If the water should become  lighter in an infinitesimal degree, or the world rotate more slowly,  the poles would be submerged and the equator become an arid waste.  No balance, turning to 1/1000 of a grain, is more delicate than  the poise of forces on the world. Laplace has given us proof that  the period of the earth's axial rotation has not changed 1/100  of a second of time in two thousand years.    [Page 146]  _Tides._    But there is an outside influence that is constantly acting upon  the earth, and to which it constantly responds. Two hundred and  forty thousand miles from the earth is the moon, having 1/81 the  mass of the world. Its attractive influence on the earth causes the  movable and nearer portions to hurry away from the more stable and  distant, and heap themselves up on that part of the earth nearest  the moon. Gravitation is inversely as the square of the distance;  hence the water on the surface of the earth is attracted more than  the body of the earth, some parts of which are eight thousand miles  farther off; hence the water rises on the side next the moon. But  the earth, as a whole, is nearer the moon than the water on the  opposite side, and being drawn more strongly, is taken away from  the water, leaving it heaped up also on the side opposite to the  moon.    A subsidiary cause of tides is found in the revolution of the earth  and moon about their common centre of gravity. Revolution about  an axis through the centre of a sphere enlarges the equator by  centrifugal force. Revolution about an axis touching the surface  of a flexible globe converts it into an egg-shaped body, with the  longer axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. In Fig. 56 the  point of revolution is seen at the centre of gravity at G; hence,  in the revolution of earth and moon as one, a strong centrifugal  force is caused at D, and a less one at C. This gives greater height  to the tides than the attraction of the moon alone could produce.    [Page 147]  [Illustration: Fig. 56.]    If the earth had no axial revolution, the attractive point where  the tide rises would be carried around the earth once in twenty-seven  days by the moon's revolution about the earth. But since the earth  revolves on its axis, it presents a new section to the moon's attraction  every hour. If the moon were stationary, that would bring two high  tides in exactly twenty-four hours; but as the moon goes forward,  we need nearly twenty-five hours for two tides.    The attractive influence of the sun also gives us a tide four-tenths  as great as that of the moon. When these two influences of the sun  and moon combine, as they do, in conjunction--when both bodies  are on one side of the earth; or in opposition, sun and moon being  on opposite sides of the earth--we have spring or increased tides.  When the moon is in its first or third quarter, _i. e._, when a  line from the moon to the earth makes a right angle with one from  the sun to the earth, these influences antagonize one another,  and we have the neap or low tides.    It is easy to see that if, when the moon was drawing its usual  tide, the sun drew four-tenths of the water in a tide at right  angles with it, the moon's tide must be by so much lower. Because  of the inertia of the water [Page 148] it does not yield instantly  to the moon's influence, and the crest of the tide is some hours  behind the advancing moon.    The amount of tide in various places is affected by almost innumerable  influences, as distance of moon at its apogee or perigee; its position  north, south, or at the equator; distance of earth from sun at  perihelion and aphelion; the position of islands; the trend of  continents, etc. All eastern shores have far greater tides than  western. As the earth rolls to the east it leaves the tide-crest  under the moon to impinge on eastern shores, hence the tides of  from seventy-five to one hundred feet in the Bay of Fundy. Lakes and  most seas are too small to have perceptible tides. The spring-tides  in the Mediterranean Sea are only about three inches.    This constant ebb and flow of the great sea is a grand provision for  its purification. Even the wind is sent to the sea to be cleansed.  The sea washes every shore, purifies every cove, bay, and river  twice every twenty-four hours. All putrescible matter liable to  breed a pestilence is carried far from shore and sunk under fathoms  of the never-stagnant sea. The distant moon lends its mighty power  to carry the burdens of commerce. She takes all the loads that  can be floated on her flowing tides, and cheerfully carries them  in opposite directions in successive journeys.    It must be conceded that the profoundest study has not mastered  the whole philosophy of tides. There are certain facts which are  apparent, but for an explanation of their true theory such men as  Laplace, Newton, and Airy have labored in vain. There are plenty  of other worlds still to conquer.      [Page 150]  [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Lunar Day.]    [Page 151]  THE MOON.

When the astronomer Herschel was observing the southern sky from  the Cape of Good Hope, the most clever hoax was perpetrated that  ever was palmed upon a credulous public. Some new and wonderful  instruments were carefully described as having been used by that  astronomer, whereby he was enabled to bring the moon so close that  he could see thereon trees, houses, animals, and men-like human  beings. He could even discern their movements, and gestures that  indicated a peaceful race. The extent of the hoax will be perceived  when it is stated that no telescope that we are now able to make  reveals the moon more clearly than it would appear to the naked  eye if it was one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles away.  The distance at which a man can be seen by the unaided eye varies  according to circumstances of position, background, light, and  eye, but it is much inside of five miles.    Since, however, the moon is our nearest neighbor, a member of our  own family in fact, it is a most interesting object of study.    A glance at its familiar face reveals its unequal illumination.  All ages and races have seen a man in the moon. All lovers have  sworn by its constancy, and only part of them have kept their oaths.  Every twenty-nine or thirty days we see a silver crescent in the  west, and are glad if it comes over the right shoulder--so [Page  152] much tribute does habit pay to superstition. The next night it  is thirteen degrees farther east from the sun. We note the stars it  occults, or passes by, and leaves behind as it broadens its disk,  till it rises full-orbed in the east when the sun sinks in the west.  It is easy to see that the moon goes around the earth from west to  east. Afterward it rises later and smaller each night, till at  length, lost from sight, it rises about the same time as the sun,  and soon becomes the welcome crescent new moon again."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#20)"],[1," shaken the dews that waken                The sweet buds, every one--\"    She went on a little farther, until she could hear only the higher  tones of Kate's voice above the happy gurgle of the stream. She  scrambled through a willow tangle, stopped on the farther side to  listen, and smiled when the water talked to her with no interruption  of human voices.    \"And Doug thinks he's a real nature lover!\" she commented, throwing  her cushions down into a grassy little hollow under the bank. \"But if  he would rather hear Kate elocute about it than to lie and listen to  the real thing, he's nothing more or less than a nature pirate.\" She  curled herself down among the cushions and stared up through the  slender willow branches into the top of an alder that leaned over the  bank and dangled its finger-tip branches playfully toward her.    \"You pretty thing!\" she cooed to it. \"What does ail people, that they  sit around and talk about you and make up rhymes about you, when you  just want them to come out and love you! You darling! Words only make  you cheap. Now whisper to me, all about when you woke up last spring  and found the sun warm and waiting--Go on--tell me about it, and what  you said to the creek, and all.\"    Having listened to Kate's dramatic rendition of the poem he liked, the  professor went over and made himself comfortable in the hammock and  began talking again about the fire. It was a magnificent spectacle, he  declared, although he was really too close to it to obtain the best  view. A lot of fine timber was ruined, of course; but fortunately not  a tree on any of their claims had been touched. The wind had blown the  flames in another direction.    \"It would have been terrible to have a fire start in our timber,\" he  went on. \"We should lose all that we have put into the venture so  far--and that would mean a good deal to us all. As it stands now, we  have had a narrow escape. Did you go up where you could obtain a view  of the fire, Kate?\"    \"No, I didn't.\" Kate poured herself out a glass of lemonade. \"I was so  worried about Marion I couldn't think of anything else. And when the  man stopped and told me where she was, it was dark and I was afraid to  go off alone. Douglas, I never spent as miserable a night in all my  life. The tremendous risk you and Fred were taking made me fairly wild  with anxiety--and then Marion's performance coming up on top of  that--\"    \"What was Marion's performance? Did she sit by the creek again until  after dark, refusing to stir?\" He smiled tolerantly. \"I know how  trying Marion's little peculiarities can be. But you surely wouldn't  take them seriously, Kate.\"    \"Oh, no, I suppose not. But when it comes to getting herself caught on  the other side of the fire, and going up to that lookout station and  staying all night, and nobody up there except the lookout man--\"    \"No! By George, did she do that?\"    \"Yes, she did, and I think it's perfectly awful! I don't suppose she  could get back, after the fire got started,\" she admitted grudgingly,  \"but she might have done _something_, don't you think? She could have  gone down the other side, it seems to me. I know I'd have gotten back  somehow. And what hurts me, Douglas, is the way she passed it over, as  though it was nothing! She knew how worried I was, and she didn't  seem to care at all. She made a joke of it.\"    \"Well! By George, I am surprised. But Marion is inclined to be a  trifle self-centered, I have noticed. Probably she doesn't realize  your point of view at all. I am sure she likes you too much to hurt  you deliberately, Kate. And young people nowadays have such different  standards of morals. She may actually feel that it isn't shocking, and  she may be hurt at your apparent lack of confidence in her.\"    \"She couldn't possibly think that.\" Kate was too loyal at heart to  contemplate that possibility for a moment. \"Marion knows better than  that. But it does hurt me to see her so careless of her own dignity  and good name. We're strangers in this community, and people are going  to judge us by appearances. They have nothing else to go by. I care  more for Marion, it seems to me, than she cares for herself. Why,  Douglas, that girl even telephoned down to the Forest Service that she  was up there and going to stay, and wanted them to send word to me.  And they are men in that office--human beings, that are bound to think  things. What _can_ they think, not knowing Marion at all, and just  judging by appearances?\"    \"I suppose they understood perfectly that it would be impossible for  her to get home across the fire, Kate. By George! I can see myself  that she couldn't do it. I shouldn't blame the girl for that, Kate.  And I can see also that it was a consideration for you that prompted  her to send word in the only way she could. Poor girl, you are  completely worn out. Now be a good girl and go in and rest, and don't  worry any more about it. I shall stay here and keep an eye on  camp--and I want you to promise that you will lie down and take a  good, long sleep. Go--you need it more than you realize.\"    Tears--unreasoning, woman tears--stood in Kate's eyes at the tender  solicitude of his tone. Very submissively she picked up the pitcher  and the glasses and went into the cabin. The professor sighed when she  was gone, kneaded the pillows into a more comfortable position and  proceeded to keep an eye on camp by falling into so sound a sleep that  within five minutes he was snoring gently. It would be cruel to  suspect him of wanting to be rid of Kate and her troubles so that he  could sleep, but he certainly lost no time in profiting by her  absence. Nature had skimped her material when she fashioned Professor  Harrison. He was not much taller than Kate--not so tall as Marion by a  full inch--and he was narrow shouldered and shallow chested, with  thin, bony wrists and a bulging forehead that seemed to bulge worse  than it really did because of his scanty growth of hair. He was a kind  hearted little man, but the forest rangers had worked him hard all  night. One cannot blame him for wanting to sleep in peace, with no  sound but the gurgle of the creek two rods away, and the warbling call  of a little, yellow-breasted bird in the alders near by.    It was Fred Humphrey tramping wearily into camp three hours later, who  awoke him. Fred was an altogether different type of man, and he was  not so careful to conceal his own desires. Just now he was hungry, and  so he called for Kate. Moreover, he had with him two men, and they  were just as hungry as he was, even if they did suppress the fact  politely.    \"Oh, Kate! Can you scare up something right away for us to eat? Make a  lot of coffee, will you? And never mind fancy fixings--real grub is  what we want right now. Where's Marion? She can help you get it ready,  can't she?\"    Kate was heard moving inside the cabin when Fred first called her. Now  she looked out of the door, and dodged back embarrassed when she saw  the two strangers. She was in a kimono, and had her hair down;  evidently she had obeyed the professor implicitly in the matter of  going to sleep.    \"Oh!\" she said, \"I don't know where Marion is--as usual; but I can  have luncheon ready in a very short time, I'm sure. Is the fire--\"    \"'Luncheon!'\" snorted Fred, laughing a little. \"Don't you palm off any  luncheon on us! That sounds like a dab of salad and a dab of sauce and  two peas in a platter and a prayer for dinner to hurry up and come  around! Cook us some grub, old girl--lots of it. Coffee and bacon and  flour gravy and spuds. We'd rather wait a few minutes longer and get a  square meal, wouldn't we, boys? Make yourselves at home. There's all  the ground there is, to sit down on, and there's the whole creek to  wash in, if the basin down there is too small. I'm going to get some  clean clothes and go down to the big hole and take a plunge. How long  will it be before chuck's ready, Kate?\"    Kate told him half an hour, and he went off down the creek, keeping at  the edge of the little meadow, with a change of clothing under his arm  and a big bath towel hung over his shoulder. The two men followed him  listlessly, too tired, evidently, to care much what they did.    Fred, leading the way, plunged through the willow fringe and came upon  the creek bank three feet from where Marion lay curled up on her  cushions. He stood for a minute looking down at her before his  present, material needs dominated his admiration of her beauty--for  beautiful she was, lying there in a nest of green, with her yellow  hair falling loosely about her face.    \"Hello! Asleep?\" he called to her, much as he had called to Kate.  \"Afraid we'll have to ask you to move on, sister. We want to take a  swim right here. And anyway, Kate wants you right away, quick. Wake  up, like a good girl, and run along.\"    \"I don't want to wake up. Go away and let me sleep.\" Marion opened her  eyes long enough to make sure that he was standing right there  waiting, and closed them again. \"Go somewhere else and swim. There's  lots of creek that isn't in use.\"    \"No sir, by heck, I'm going to take my swim right here. I'm too  doggone tired to walk another yard. Suit yourself about going, though.  Don't let me hurry you at all.\" He sat down and began to unlace his  shoes, grinning back over his shoulder at the other two who had not  ventured down to the creek when they heard the voice of a woman there.    Marion sat up indignantly. \"Go on down the creek, why don't you?\"    \"Oh, this place suits me fine.\" Fred, having removed one shoe, turned  it upside down and shook out the sand, and began unlacing the other.    Marion waited stubbornly until he was pulling that shoe off, and then  she gathered up her cushions and fled, flushed and angry. She was  frequently angry with Fred, who never yielded an inch and never would  argue or cajole. She firmly believed that Fred would actually have  gone in swimming with"]]]
