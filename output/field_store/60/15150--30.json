He had been so  strong, that when he struck his head with all his force upon the stone  wall it did not stun him nor pain him--only made him laugh. That was a  dreadful night.    When he clasped his hands frantically and prayed--\"O God, my beautiful  God, my sweet God, once, only once, let me feel you near me tonight!\"  he could not feel him. He prayed aloud, very loud, and he got no answer;  when he listened it was all quite quiet--like when the priests of Baal  cried aloud to their god--\"Oh, Baal, hear us! Oh, Baal, hear us! But  Baal was gone a-hunting.\"    That was a long wild night, and wild thoughts came and went in it; but  they left their marks behind them forever: for, as years cannot pass  without leaving their traces behind them, neither can nights into which  are forced the thoughts and sufferings of years. And now the dawn was  coming, and at last he was very tired. He shivered and tried to draw the  shirt up over his shoulders. They were getting stiff. He had never known  they were cut in the night. He looked up at the white light that came  in through the hole at the top of the door and shuddered. Then he turned  his face back to the ground and slept again.    Some hours later Bonaparte came toward the fuel-house with a lump of  bread in his hand. He opened the door and peered in; then entered,  and touched the fellow with his boot. Seeing that he breathed heavily,  though he did not rouse, Bonaparte threw the bread down on the ground.  He was alive, that was one thing. He bent over him, and carefully  scratched open one of the cuts with the nail of his forefinger,  examining with much interest his last night's work. He would have to  count his sheep himself that day; the boy was literally cut up. He  locked the door and went away again.    \"Oh, Lyndall,\" said Em, entering the dining room, and bathed in tears,  that afternoon, \"I have been begging Bonaparte to let him out, and he  won't.\"    \"The more you beg the more he will not,\" said Lyndall.    She was cutting out aprons on the table.    \"Oh, but it's late, and I think they want to kill him,\" said Em, weeping  bitterly; and finding that no more consolation was to be gained from her  cousin, she went off blubbering--\"I wonder you can cut out aprons when  Waldo is shut up like that.\"    For ten minutes after she was gone Lyndall worked on quietly; then she  folded up her stuff, rolled it tightly together, and stood before the  closed door of the sitting room with her hands closely clasped. A flush  rose to her face: she opened the door quickly, and walked in, went to  the nail on which the key of the fuel-room hung. Bonaparte and Tant  Sannie sat there and saw her.    \"What do you want?\" they asked together.    \"This key,\" she said, holding it up, and looking at them.    \"Do you mean her to have it?\" said Tant Sannie in Dutch.    \"Why don't you stop her?\" asked Bonaparte in English.    \"Why don't you take it from her?\" said Tant Sannie.    So they looked at each other, talking, while Lyndall walked to the  fuel-house with the key, her underlip bitten in.    \"Waldo,\" she said, as she helped him to stand up, and twisted his arm  about her waist to support him, \"we will not be children always; we  shall have the power, too, some day.\" She kissed his naked shoulder with  her soft little mouth. It was all the comfort her young soul could give  him.        Chapter 1.XIII. He Makes Love.    \"Here,\" said Tant Sannie to her Hottentot maid, \"I have been in this  house four years, and never been up in the loft. Fatter women than I go  up ladders; I will go up today and see what it is like, and put it to  rights up there. You bring the little ladder and stand at the bottom.\"    \"There's one would be sorry if you were to fall,\" said the Hottentot  maid, leering at Bonaparte's pipe, that lay on the table.    \"Hold your tongue, jade,\" said her mistress, trying to conceal a pleased  smile, \"and go and fetch the ladder.\"    There was a never-used trap-door at one end of the sitting room: this  the Hottentot maid pushed open, and setting the ladder against it, the  Boer-woman with some danger and difficulty climbed into the loft. Then  the Hottentot maid took the ladder away, as her husband was mending the  wagon-house, and needed it; but the trap-door was left open.    For a little while Tant Sannie poked about among the empty bottles and  skins, and looked at the bag of peaches that Waldo was supposed to have  liked so; then she sat down near the trap-door beside a barrel of salt  mutton. She found that the pieces of meat were much too large, and took  out her clasp-knife to divide them.    That was always the way when one left things to servants, she grumbled  to herself: but when once she was married to her husband Bonaparte it  would not matter whether a sheep spoiled or no--when once his rich aunt  with the dropsy was dead. She smiled as she dived her hand into the  pickle-water.    At that instant her niece entered the room below, closely followed by  Bonaparte, with his head on one side, smiling mawkishly. Had Tant Sannie  spoken at that moment the life of Bonaparte Blenkins would have run a  wholly different course; as it was, she remained silent, and neither  noticed the open trap-door above their heads.    \"Sit there, my love,\" said Bonaparte, motioning Trana into her aunt's  elbow-chair, and drawing another close up in front of it, in which he  seated himself. \"There, put your feet upon the stove too. Your aunt has  gone out somewhere. Long have I waited for this auspicious event!\"    Trana, who understood not one word of English, sat down in the chair and  wondered if this was one of the strange customs of other lands, that an  old gentleman may bring his chair up to yours, and sit with his knees  touching you. She had been five days in Bonaparte's company, and feared  the old man, and disliked his nose.    \"How long have I desired this moment!\" said Bonaparte. \"But that aged  relative of thine is always casting her unhallowed shadow upon us. Look  into my eyes, Trana.\"    Bonaparte knew that she comprehended not a syllable; but he understood  that it is the eye, the tone, the action, and not at all the rational  word, that touches the love-chords. He saw she changed colour.    \"All night,\" said Bonaparte, \"I lie awake; I see naught but thy angelic  countenance. I open my arms to receive thee--where art thou, where? Thou  art not there!\" said Bonaparte, suiting the action to the words, and  spreading out his arms and drawing them to his breast.    \"Oh, please, I don't understand,\" said Trana, \"I want to go away.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Bonaparte, leaning back in his chair, to her  great relief, and pressing his hands on his heart, \"since first thy  amethystine countenance was impressed here--what have I not suffered,  what have I not felt? Oh, the pangs unspoken, burning as an ardent coal  in a fiery and uncontaminated bosom!\" said Bonaparte, bending forward  again.    \"Dear Lord!\" said Trana to herself, \"how foolish I have been! The old  man has a pain in his stomach, and now, as my aunt is out, he has come  to me to help him.\"    She smiled kindly at Bonaparte, and pushing past him, went to the  bedroom, quickly returning with a bottle of red drops in her hand.    \"They are very good for benauwdheid; my mother always drinks them,\" she  said, holding the bottle out.    The face in the trap-door was a fiery red. Like a tiger-cat ready to  spring. Tant Sannie crouched, with the shoulder of mutton in her hand.  Exactly beneath her stood Bonaparte. She rose and clasped with both arms  the barrel of salt meat.    \"What, rose of the desert, nightingale of the colony, that with thine  amorous lay whilest the lonesome night!\" cried Bonaparte, seizing the  hand that held the vonlicsense. \"Nay, struggle not! Fly as a stricken  fawn into the arms that would embrace thee, thou--\"    Here a stream of cold pickle-water, heavy with ribs and shoulders,  descending on his head abruptly terminated his speech. Half-blinded,  Bonaparte looked up through the drops that hung from his eyelids, and  saw the red face that looked down at him. With one wild cry he fled.  As he passed out at the front door a shoulder of mutton, well-directed,  struck the black coat in the small of the back.    \"Bring the ladder! bring the ladder! I will go after him!\" cried the  Boer-woman, as Bonaparte Blenkins wildly fled into the fields.    *****    Late in the evening of the same day Waldo knelt on the floor of his  cabin. He bathed the foot of his dog which had been pierced by a thorn.  The bruises on his own back had had five days to heal in, and, except  a little stiffness in his movements, there was nothing remarkable about  the boy.    The troubles of the young are soon over; they leave no external mark.  If you wound the tree in its youth the bark will quickly cover the  gash; but when the tree is very old, peeling the bark off, and looking  carefully, you will see the scar there still. All that is buried is not  dead.    Waldo poured the warm milk over the little swollen foot; Doss lay very  quiet, with tears in his eyes. Then there was a tap at the door. In an  instant Doss looked wide awake, and winked the tears out from between  his little lids.    \"Come in,\" said Waldo, intent on his work; and slowly and cautiously the  door opened.    \"Good evening, Waldo, my boy,\" said Bonaparte Blenkins in a mild voice,  not venturing more than his nose within the door. \"How are you this  evening?\"    Doss growled and showed his little teeth, and tried to rise, but his paw  hurt him so he whined.    \"I'm very tired, Waldo, my boy,\" said Bonaparte plaintively.    Doss showed his little white teeth again. His master went on with his  work without looking round. There are some people at whose hands it is  best not to look. At last he said:    \"Come in.\"    Bonaparte stepped cautiously a little way into the room, and left the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#20)"],[1,"this time--replied: 'Surely a Transvaal detective  would speak Dutch. Trust to the shadow.' So I trusted, and after a spell  another man came out of the house, lighted a cigar, and both he and the  other walked off together. No sooner had they turned than a cat pursued  by a dog rushed into the bushes and collided with me. The startled  animal uttered a 'miaul' of alarm and darted back again, making a  horrible rustling. Both men stopped at once. But it was only the cat, as  they doubtless observed, and they passed out of the garden gate into the  town.    I looked at my watch. An hour had passed since I climbed the wall. Where  was my comrade? Suddenly I heard a voice from within the quadrangle say,  quite loud, 'All up.' I crawled back to the wall. Two officers were  walking up and down the other side jabbering Latin words, laughing and  talking all manner of nonsense--amid which I caught my name. I risked a  cough. One of the officers immediately began to chatter alone. The other  said slowly and clearly, '... cannot get out. The sentry suspects. It's  all up. Can you get back again?' But now all my fears fell from me at  once. To go back was impossible. I could not hope to climb the wall  unnoticed. Fate pointed onwards. Besides, I said to myself, 'Of course,  I shall be recaptured, but I will at least have a run for my money.' I  said to the officers, 'I shall go on alone.'    Now I was in the right mood for these undertakings--that is to say that,  thinking failure almost certain, no odds against success affected me.  All risks were less than the certainty. A glance at the plan (p. 182)  will show that the rate which led into the road was only a few yards  from another sentry. I said to myself, 'Toujours de l'audace:' put my  hat on my head, strode into the middle of the garden, walked past the  windows of the house without any attempt at concealment, and so went  through the gate and turned to the left. I passed the sentry at less  than five yards. Most of them knew me by sight. Whether he looked at me  or not I do not know, for I never turned my head. But after walking a  hundred yards and hearing no challenge, I knew that the second obstacle  had been surmounted. I was at large in Pretoria.    I walked on leisurely through the night humming a tune and choosing the  middle of the road. The streets were full of Burghers, but they paid no  attention to me. Gradually I reached the suburbs, and on a little bridge  I sat down to reflect and consider. I was in the heart of the enemy's  country. I knew no one to whom I could apply for succour. Nearly three  hundred miles stretched between me and Delagoa Bay. My escape must be  known at dawn. Pursuit would be immediate. Yet all exits were barred.  The town was picketed, the country was patrolled, the trains were  searched, the line was guarded. I had 75_l_. in my pocket and four slabs  of chocolate, but the compass and the map which might have guided me,  the opium tablets and meat lozenges which should have sustained me, were  in my friend's pockets in the States Model Schools. Worst of all, I  could not speak a word of Dutch or Kaffir, and how was I to get food or  direction?    But when hope had departed, fear had gone as well. I formed a plan. I  would find the Delagoa Bay Railway. Without map or compass I must follow  that in spite of the pickets. I looked at the stars. Orion shone  brightly. Scarcely a year ago he had guided me when lost in the desert  to the banks of the Nile. He had given me water. Now he should lead to  freedom. I could not endure the want of either.    After walking south for half a mile, I struck the railroad. Was it the  line to Delagoa Bay or the Pietersburg branch? If it were the former it  should run east. But so far as I could see this line ran northwards.  Still, it might be only winding its way out among the hills. I resolved  to follow it. The night was delicious. A cool breeze fanned my face and  a wild feeling of exhilaration took hold of me. At any rate, I was free,  if only for an hour. That was something. The fascination of the  adventure grew. Unless the stars in their courses fought for me I could  not escape. Where, then, was the need of caution? I marched briskly  along the line. Here and there the lights of a picket fire gleamed.  Every bridge had its watchers. But I passed them all, making very short  detours at the dangerous places, and really taking scarcely any  precautions. Perhaps that was the reason I succeeded.    As I walked I extended my plan. I could not march three hundred miles  to the frontier. I would board a train in motion and hide under the  seats, on the roof, on the couplings--anywhere. What train should I  take? The first, of course. After walking for two hours I perceived the  signal lights of a station. I left the line, and, circling round it, hid  in the ditch by the track about 200 yards beyond it. I argued that the  train would stop at the station and that it would not have got up too  much speed by the time it reached me. An hour passed. I began to grow  impatient. Suddenly I heard the whistle and the approaching rattle. Then  the great yellow head lights of the engine flashed into view. The train  waited five minutes at the station and started again with much noise and  steaming. I crouched by the track. I rehearsed the act in my mind. I  must wait until the engine had passed, otherwise I should be seen. Then  I must make a dash for the carriages.    The train started slowly, but gathered speed sooner than I had expected.  The flaring lights drew swiftly near. The rattle grew into a roar. The  dark mass hung for a second above me. The engine-driver silhouetted  against his furnace glow, the black profile of the engine, the clouds of  steam rushed past. Then I hurled myself on the trucks, clutched at  something, missed, clutched again, missed again, grasped some sort of  hand-hold, was swung off my feet--my toes bumping on the line, and with  a struggle seated myself on the couplings of the fifth truck from the  front of the train. It was a goods train, and the trucks were full of  sacks, soft sacks covered with coal dust. I crawled on top and burrowed  in among them. In five minutes I was completely buried. The sacks were  warm and comfortable. Perhaps the engine-driver had seen me rush up to  the train and would give the alarm at the next station: on the other  hand, perhaps not. Where was the train going to? Where would it be  unloaded? Would it be searched? Was it on the Delagoa Bay line? What  should I do in the morning? Ah, never mind that. Sufficient for the day  was the luck thereof. Fresh plans for fresh contingencies. I resolved  to sleep, nor can I imagine a more pleasing lullaby than the clatter of  the train that carries you at twenty miles an hour away from the enemy's  capital.    How long I slept I do not know, but I woke up suddenly with all feelings  of exhilaration gone, and only the consciousness of oppressive  difficulties heavy on me. I must leave the train before daybreak, so  that I could drink at a pool and find some hiding-place while it was  still dark. Another night I would board another train. I crawled from my  cosy hiding-place among the sacks and sat again on the couplings. The  train was running at a fair speed, but I felt it was time to leave it. I  took hold of the iron handle at the back of the truck, pulled strongly  with my left hand, and sprang. My feet struck the ground in two gigantic  strides, and the next instant I was sprawling in the ditch, considerably  shaken but unhurt. The train, my faithful ally of the night, hurried on  its journey.    It was still dark. I was in the middle of a wide valley, surrounded by  low hills, and carpeted with high grass drenched in dew. I searched for  water in the nearest gully, and soon found a clear pool. I was very  thirsty, but long after I had quenched my thirst I continued to drink,  that I might have sufficient for the whole day.    Presently the dawn began to break, and the sky to the east grew yellow  and red, slashed across with heavy black clouds. I saw with relief that  the railway ran steadily towards the sunrise. I had taken the right  line, after all.    Having drunk my fill, I set out for the hills, among which I hoped to  find some hiding-place, and as it became broad daylight I entered a  small grove of trees which grew on the side of a deep ravine. Here I  resolved to wait till dusk. I had one consolation: no one in the world  knew where I was--I did not know myself. It was now four o'clock.  Fourteen hours lay between me and the night. My impatience to proceed,  while I was still strong, doubled their length. At first it was terribly  cold, but by degrees the sun gained power, and by ten o'clock the heat  was oppressive. My sole companion was a gigantic vulture, who manifested  an extravagant interest in my condition, and made hideous and ominous  gurglings from time to time. From my lofty position I commanded a view  of the whole valley. A little tin-roofed town lay three miles to the  westward. Scattered farmsteads, each with a clump of trees, relieved the  monotony of the undulating ground. At the foot of the hill stood a  Kaffir kraal, and the figures of its inhabitants dotted the patches of  cultivation or surrounded the droves of goats and cows which fed on the  pasture. The railway ran through the middle of the valley, and I could  watch the passage of the various trains. I counted four passing each  way, and from this I drew the conclusion that the same number would run  by night. I marked a steep gradient up which they climbed very slowly,  and determined at nightfall to make another attempt to board one of  these. During the day I ate one slab of chocolate, which, with the heat,  produced a violent thirst. The pool was hardly half a mile away, but I  dared not leave the shelter of the little wood, for I could see the  figures of white men riding or walking"]]]
