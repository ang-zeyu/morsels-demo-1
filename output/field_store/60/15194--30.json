Further on in the interior       our men have wrecked everything like vandals. Everything has       been searched. Outside, throughout the country, the spectacle       of the inhabitants who have been shot defies any description.       They have been shot at such short range that they are almost       decapitated. Every house has been ransacked to the furthest       corners, and the inhabitants dragged from their hiding places.       The men shot; the women and children locked into a convent,       from which shots were fired. And, for this reason, the convent       is about to be set fire to; it may, however be ransomed if it       surrenders the guilty ones and pays a ransom of 15,000 francs.    We shall see as we proceed how these notebooks complement one another.         (d) Notebook of the Private Philipp, (from Kamenz, Saxony,       First Company, First Battalion, 178th Regiment.) On the day       indicated above--Aug. 23--a private of the same regiment was       the witness of a scene similar to that just described;       perhaps, the same scene, but the point of view is       different.--At 10 o'clock in the evening the First Battalion       of the 178th came down into the burning village to the north       of Dinant--a saddening spectacle--to make one shiver. At the       entrance to the village lay the bodies of some fifty citizens,       shot for having fired upon our troops from ambush. In the       course of the night many others were shot down in like manner,       so that we counted more than two hundred. Women and children,       holding their lamps, were compelled to assist at this horrible       spectacle. We then sat down midst the corpses to eat our rice,       as we had eaten nothing since morning. (Fig. 4.)    [Illustration: Figure 4.]    Here is a military picture fully outlined, and worthy to compete in the  Academy of Fine Arts of Dresden. But one passage of the text is somewhat  obscure and might embarrass the artist--\"Women and children, holding  their lamps, were compelled to assist at this horrible spectacle.\" What  spectacle?--the shooting, or the counting of the corpses? To get some  certainty on this historic point, the artist should question that noble  soldier--the Colonel of the 178th.    His work of that night, however, was in accord with the spirit of his  companions in arms, and of his chiefs. We may assure ourselves of this  by consulting the Sixth Report of the Belgian Commission of Inquiry  upon, the violation of the rules of the law of nations (Havre, Nov. 10,  1914) and the ignoble proclamations placarded by the Germans throughout  Belgium. I will content myself with three short extracts.    Extract from a proclamation of General von Buelow, placarded at Liege,  Aug. 22, 1914:         The inhabitants of the city of Andenne, after having protested       their peaceful intentions, were guilty of a treacherous       surprise upon our troops. It was with my consent that the       General in Chief set fire to the whole locality, and that       about one hundred persons were shot.    (The Belgian report controverts the accusation against the inhabitants  of Andenne of having taken hostile measures against the German troops,  and adds: \"As a matter of fact, more than two hundred persons were  shot\"--almost everything was ravaged. For a distance of at least three  leagues the houses were destroyed by fire.)    Extract from a proclamation of Major Dieckmann, placarded at Grivegnee,  Sept. 8, 1914:         Any one not responding instantly to the command \"raise your       arms\" is subject to the penalty of death.    Extract from proclamation of Marshal Baron von der Goltz, placarded at  Brussels, Oct. 5, 1914:         Hereafter the localities nearest the place where similar acts       (destruction of railways or telegraphic lines) were       done--whether or not they were _accomplices in the act_--will       be punished without mercy. To this end hostages have been       taken from all the localities adjacent to railways menaced by       similar attacks, and upon the first attempt to destroy the       railways, telegraphic or telephone lines, they will at once be       shot.      III.    I copy from the first page of an unsigned notebook, (Fig. 5:)         Langeviller, Aug. 22.--Village destroyed by the Eleventh       Battalion of Pioneers. Three women hanged to trees; the first       dead I have seen.    Who can these three women be?--criminals undoubtedly--guilty of having  fired upon German troops, unless, indeed, they may have been \"in  communication by telephone\" with the enemy; and the Eleventh Pioneers  unquestionably meted out to them just punishment. But, at all events,  they expiated their guilt, and the Eleventh Pioneers has passed on. The  crime these women committed is unknown to the troops which are to  follow. Among these new troops will there be found no chief, no  Christian, to order the ropes cut and allow these dangling bodies to  rest on the earth?    [Illustration: Figure 5.]    No, the regiment passes under the gibbets and their flags brush against  the hanging corpses; they pass on, Colonel and officers--gentlemen  all--Kulturtraeger. And they do this knowingly; these corpses must hang  there as an example, not for the other women of the village, for these  doubtless already understand, but as an example to the regiment and to  the other regiments that will follow, and who must be attuned to war,  who must be taught their stern duty to kill women when occasion offers.  The teaching will be effective, unquestionably. Shall we look for proof  of it? The young soldier, who tells us above that these corpses were the  first dead he had ever seen, adds a week later, on the tenth and last  page of his notebook, the following, (Fig. 6:)         In this way we destroyed eight dwellings and their       inhabitants. In one of the houses we bayoneted two men, with       their wives and a young girl 18 years old. The young: one       almost unmanned me, her look was so innocent! But we could not       master the excited troop, for at such times they are no longer       men--they are beasts.    [Illustration: Figure 6.]    Let me add a few texts which will attest that these assassinations of  women and children are customary tasks set to German soldiers:    (a) The writer in a notebook, unsigned, reports that at Orchies (Nord)  \"a woman was shot for not having obeyed the command to halt!\" whereupon  he adds, \"the whole locality was set on fire.\" (Fig. 7.)    [Illustration: Figure 7.]    (b) The officer of the 178th Saxon Regiment, mentioned above, reports  that in the vicinity of Lisognes (Belgian Ardennes) \"the Chasseur of  Marburg, having placed three women in line, killed them all with one  shot.\"    (c) A few lines more, taken from the notebook of the Reservist Schlauter  (Third Battery, Fourth Regiment, Field Artillery of the Guard,) (Fig.  8:)         Aug. 25, (in Belgium.)--We shot 300 of the inhabitants of the       town. Those that survived the salvo were requisitioned as       grave diggers. You should have seen the women at that time!       But it was impossible to do otherwise. In our march upon Wilot       things went better; the inhabitants who wished to leave were       allowed to do so. But whoever fired was shot. Upon our leaving       Owele the rifles rang out, and with that, flames, women, and       all the rest.    [Illustration: Figure 8.]      IV.    Frequently when a German troop want to carry a position, they place  before them civilians--men, women, and children--and find shelter behind  these ramparts of living flesh. As such a stratagem is essentially  playing upon the nobility of heart of the adversary, and saying to him  \"you won't fire upon these unfortunates, I know it, and I hold you at my  mercy, unarmed, because you are not as craven as I am,\" as it implies a  homage to the enemy and the self-degradation of the one employing it, it  is almost inconceivable that soldiers should resort to it; it represents  a new invention in the long story of human vileness, which even the  dreadful Penitentiels of the Middle Ages had not discovered. In reading  the stories from French, Belgian, and English sources, attributing such  practices to the Germans, it has made me doubt, if not the truthfulness,  at least the detailed exactness of the stories. It seemed to me that the  tales must be of crimes by men who would be disavowed, individual  lapses, which do not dishonor the nation, because the nation on  ascertaining them would repudiate them. But how can we doubt that the  German Nation has, on the contrary, accepted these acts as exploits  worthy of herself, that in them she recognizes her own aptitudes, and  finds pleasure in the contemplation; how, I ask, can we doubt this in  reading the following narrative signed by a Bavarian officer, Lieut. A.  Eberlein, spread out in the columns of one of the best known periodicals  of Germany, the Muenchner Neueste Nachrichten, in its issue of Wednesday,  Oct. 7, 1914, Page 22, Lieut. Eberlein relates there the occupation of  Saint-Die at the end of August. He entered the town at the head of a  column, and while waiting for reinforcements was compelled to barricade  himself in a house, (Fig. 9:)    [Illustration: Figure 9.]         We arrested three civilians, and a bright idea struck me. We       furnished them with chairs and made them seat themselves in       the middle of the street. There were supplications on one       part, and some blows with the stocks of our guns on the other.       One, little by little, gets terribly hardened. Finally, there       they were sitting in the street. How many anguished prayers       they may have muttered, I cannot say, but during the whole       time their hands were joined in nervous contraction. I am       sorry for them, but the stratagem was of immediate effect. The       enfilading directed from the houses diminished at once;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#20)"],[1,"has removed every doubt; because that was a deliberate act  in full sight of the world, and of a nature not to be obscured or  confused by conflicting testimonies or questions about possible  exaggeration of outrages or about official responsibility for them. The  sinking of the Lusitania was an act which outraged not only the existing  conventions of the civilized world in regard to naval warfare, but the  moral feelings of present civilized society.    The neutral nations and some of the belligerent nations feel another  strong objection to the present German way of conducting war on land and  sea, namely that it brutalizes the soldier and the sailor to an  unprecedented degree. English French, and Russian soldiers on the one  side can contend with German, Austrian and Turkish soldiers on the other  with the utmost fierceness from trenches or in the open, use new and old  weapons of destruction, and kill and wound each other with equal ardor  and resolution, and yet not be brutalized or degraded in their moral  nature, if they fight from love of country or with self-sacrificing  loyalty to its spiritual ideals; but neither soldiers nor sailors can  attack defenseless noncombatants, systematically destroy towns and  villages, and put to death captured men, women, and children without  falling in their moral nature before the brutes. That he obeyed orders  will not save from moral ruin the soldier or sailor who does such deeds.  He should have refused to obey such orders and taken the consequences.  This is true even of the privates, but more emphatically of the  officers. The white race has often been proud of the way in which its  soldiers and sailors have fought in many causes--good, bad, and  indifferent; because they fought bravely took defeat resolutely, and  showed humanity after victory. The German method of conducting war  omits chivalry, mercy, and humanity, and thereby degrades the German  Nation and any other nation which sympathizes with it or supports its  methods. It is no answer to the world's objection to the sinking of the  Lusitania that Great Britain uses its navy to cut off from Germany food  and needed supplies for its industries, for that is a recognized and  effective method of warfare; whereas the sinking of an occasional  merchant ship with its passengers and crew is a method of warfare  nowhere effective, and almost universally condemned. If war, with its  inevitable stratagems, ambuscades, and lies must continue to be the  arbiter in international disputes, it is certainly desirable that such  magnanimity in war as the conventions of the last century made possible  should not be lost because of Germany's behavior in the present European  convulsion. It is also desirable to reaffirm with all possible emphasis  that fidelity to international agreements is the taproot of human  progress.    On the supposition that the people of the United States have learned the  lesson of the Lusitania, so far as an understanding of the issues at  stake in this gigantic war is concerned, can they also get from it any  guidance in regard to their own relation to the fateful struggle?  Apparently, not yet. With practical unanimity the American people will  henceforth heartily desire the success of the Allies, and the decisive  defeat of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey. With practical unanimity  they will support whatever action the Administration at Washington shall  decide to take in the immediate emergency; but at present they do not  feel that they know whether they can best promote the defeat of the  Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey by remaining  neutral or by taking active part in the conflict. Unless a dismemberment  of Austria-Hungary is brought about by Italy and Rumania or some other  Balkan State entering the war on the side of the Allies, it now seems as  if neither party would acknowledge defeat until exhausted or brought to  a sudden moral collapse. Exhaustion in war can best be prevented by  maintaining in activity the domestic industries and general  productiveness of the nation involved in war and those of the neutral  nations which are in position to feed it, and manufacture for it  munitions, clothing, and the other supplies that war demands. While  remaining strictly neutral, North and South America can be of great  service to the Allies. To be sure, as a neutral the United States will  be obliged to give some aid to Germany and her allies, such, for  example, as harboring the interned commercial fleet of Germany; but this  aid will be comparatively insignificant. The services which the American  republics can thus render to the cause of liberty and civilization are  probably more considerable than any they could render by direct  contributions of military or naval force. Kept free from the drain of  war, the republics will be better able to supply food, clothing,  munitions, and money to the Allies both during the war and after the  conclusion of peace.    On the whole, the wisest thing the neutral nations can do, which are  remote from the theatres of war, and have no territorial advantages to  seek at the coming of peace, is probably to defend vigorously and with  the utmost sincerity and frankness all the existing rights of neutrals.  By acting thus in the present case they will promote national  righteousness and hinder national depravity, discourage, for the future,  domination by any single great power in any part of the world, and help  the cause of civilization by strengthening the just liberty and  independence of many nations--large and small, and of different  capacities and experiences--which may reasonably hope, if the Prussian  terror can be abolished, to live together in peaceful co-operation for  the common good.          Appeals for American Defense    Need of Further Protecting Neutral Rights Set Forth.      By GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM.    _Formerly United States Attorney General._    _To the Editor of The New York Times:_    The destruction of the Lusitania by the Germans, and the wanton killing  of American men, women, and children, without warning, brings sharply  before the American people the question of how long the present sexless  policy of the conduct of our affairs is to be continued. Germany has  apparently decided to run amuck with civilization. It is now for the  American people to decide whether this nation has any virility left, or  if it is content to sink to the level of China.    A very clear course, it seems to me, is open for us to pursue: We should  cancel all diplomatic relations with a country which has declared war  upon civilization, recall our Ambassador from Berlin, and hand Count  Bernstorff his passports. Congress should be summoned in extra session,  and an appropriation of at least $250,000,000 asked to put us in a  condition to protect our rights as a neutral civilized power. At the  same time we should invite all neutral nations of the world to join us  in a council of civilization to agree upon the steps to be taken to  protect the interests of all neutral powers and their citizens from such  wanton acts of destruction of life and property as those which Germany  has been committing and which have culminated in the destruction of the  Lusitania and of so many of her passengers.    Until now the National Administration has been proceeding not only on  the basis of \"safety first,\" but of safety first, last, and all the  time. The time has arrived when we must remember the truth of what  Lowell so well expressed, that         'Tis man's perdition to be safe, when for the truth he ought       to die.    GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM.      BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY LEAGUE.    [From THE NEW YORK TIMES, May 11, 1915.]    _The army, navy, and coast defenses of the United States are declared to  be inadequate in an open letter signed by Joseph H. Choate, Alton B.  Parker, Henry L. Stimson, and S. Stanwood Menken, which was given out  yesterday in support of the plans of the National Security League. This  organization, which maintains offices at 31 Pine Street, has embarked on  a national campaign for better war defenses, and its appeal for members  and supporters is expressed by the catch-phrase, \"a first defense army  of 1,000,000 workers.\"_    _The letter of Messrs. Choate, Parker, Stimson, and Menken contains most  of the arguments put forth by the league in asking public support and  enrollment. Its text follows:_    Careful investigation by our committees who have looked into the  question of national defense brings to light the following conditions of  affairs:    According to official Government reports, there are barely 30,000 mobile  troops in continental United States. These are distributed among  fifty-two widely scattered posts, which would make it impossible to  mobilize quickly at any given point. Even this small force is short of  officers, ammunition, and equipment. Furthermore, it has no organized  reserve.    Our National Guard, with negligible exceptions, is far below its paper  strength in men, equipment, and efficiency.    Our coast defenses are inadequate, our fortifications insufficiently  manned and without adequate organized reserves.    Our navy is neither adequate nor prepared for war. This, our first line  of defense, is inadequately manned, short of ammunition, and has no  organized reserve of trained men. Our submarine flotilla exists chiefly  upon paper. Fast scout cruisers, battle cruisers, aeroplanes, mine  layers, supply ships, and transports are lacking. Target practice has  been neglected or altogether omitted.    In view of this condition of affairs, and since there is no assurance  that the United States will not again become involved in war, \"and since  a peaceful policy even when supported by treaties, is not a sufficient  guarantee against war, of which the subjugation of Belgium and the  present coercion of China by a foreign power are noteworthy examples;  and the"]]]
