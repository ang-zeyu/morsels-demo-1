THE GRIP.--Grasp the stock as high as possible with the thumb and last  three fingers, the forefinger alongside the trigger guard, the thumb  extended along the stock. The barrel hand and fore-arm should be as  nearly in one line as possible when the weapon is pointed toward the  target. The grasp should not be so tight as to cause tremors but  should be firm enough to avoid losing grip. The lower the stock is  grasped the greater will be the movement or jump of the muzzle caused  by recoil. If the hand be placed so that the grasp is on one side of  the stock, the recoil will cause a rotary movement of the weapon  toward the opposite side.    The releasing of the sear causes a slight movement of the muzzle,  generally to the left. The position and pressure of the thumb along  the stock overcomes much of this movement.    To do uniform shooting the weapon must be held with exactly the same  grip for each shot, not only must the hand grasp the stock at the same  point for each shot, but the tension of the grip must be uniform.    THE TRIGGER SQUEEZE.--The trigger must be squeezed in the same manner  as in rifle firing. The pressure of the forefinger on the trigger  should be steadily increased and should be straight back, not  sideways. The pressure should continue to that point beyond which the  slightest movement will release the sear. Then when the aim is true,  the additional pressure is applied and the pistol fired. When the  pistol is fired the greatest effort should be taken to hold the pistol  to the mark as nearly as possible. This will be of great benefit in  automatic firing.    POSITION AND AIMING DRILLS.--The Squad is formed with an interval of  one pace between files. Black pasters are used as aiming points. The  pasters are ten paces distant from the squad. The instructor command,  1. Raise, 2. Pistol and cautions \"Position and Aiming Drill.\" The men  take the position prescribed in paragraph 3. At the command, 1. Squad,  2. Fire, slowly extend the arm till it is nearly horizontal, the  pistol directed at a point; about six inches below the bull's-eye. At  the same time put the forefinger inside the trigger guard and  gradually feel the trigger. Inhale enough air to comfortably fill the  lungs and gradually raise the piece until the line of sight is  directed at the point of aim, _i.e._, just below the bull's-eye at six  o'clock. While the sights are directed upon the mark, gradually  increase the pressure on the trigger until it reaches that point where  the slightest additional pressure will release the sear. Then, when  the aim is true, the additional pressure necessary to fire the piece  is given so smoothly as not to derange the alignment of the sights.  The weapon will be held on the mark for an instant after the hammer  falls and the soldier will observe what effect, if any, the squeezing  of the trigger has had on his aim.    When the soldier has become proficient in taking the proper position  the exercise is conducted \"At Will.\"    QUICK FIRE.--Being at the Raise Pistol, chamber and magazine empty, 1.  Quick Fire Exercise, 2. One. Lower the forearm until it is nearly  horizontal, pistol pointing at the target, 3. Two. Thrust the pistol  forward to the position of aim, snapping the pistol just before the  arm reaches its full extension. Then look through sights to verify the  pointing. 4. Three. Return to Raise Pistol and cock the pistol.    In this exercise the soldier must keep his eyes fixed upon the mark.  He should constantly practice pointing the pistol until he acquires  the ability to direct it on the mark in the briefest interval of time  and practically without the aid of the sights. In other words, the  pistol in this exercise is accurately pointed instead of accurately  aimed. In night firing pointing the pistol is the only method that can  be used. After careful practice in this exercise it is surprising what  good results can be obtained at night.    This exercise should then be practiced from the position of the pistol  in the holster instead of Raise Pistol.    CLASSES OF FIRE: 1. SLOW FIRE.--As described above. Target L or A or  improvised target.    2. QUICK FIRE.--Being at Raise Pistol, pistols locked, at the command  \"Commence Firing\" fire and return to Raise Pistol after each shot  following the principles of Quick Fire Exercise. Target E, five yards  apart, one for each man firing. This firing should be done by the  numbers as described in Quick Fire Exercise.    3. AUTOMATIC FIRE (TARGET E).--Being at Raise Pistol, pistols locked.  At the command \"Commence Firing\" empty the magazine in seven seconds,  keeping the arm extended. Target E, 5 yards apart, one for each man  firing.    4. TRENCH FIRE (TARGET E).--Two lines of targets. The first line is  composed of F targets, 5 yards apart, one figure for each man firing.  The second line is composed of two E figures, one yard apart, for each  man firing, placed in a trench immediately in rear of the figures of  the first line. This gives for each firer a group of three figures,  one placed on top at the near edge of the trench and the other two in  the trench immediately in rear. In case a trench is not available the  rifle pit can be used. A gutter, sunken road, embankment, or hedge can  be used for this purpose so long as trench fire is simulated.    [Illustration: Plate #5. TRENCH TARGET COURSE FOR THE AUTOMATIC  PISTOL.]    The firing line advances at a walk from 100 yards takes up a double  time 50 yards from trench, fires one shot at the double time when  within ten yards of the first target continues to the trench and fires  the remaining six shots, automatic fire, at the two targets in the  trench in rear of the first line target.    SCORE (TARGET E, BOBBING).--A score will be seven shots. Targets will  be marked after the men in the firing line have completed their  scores. All loading and firing should be done by command.    COURSE: 1. SLOW FIRE.--10 yards. Minimum of one maximum of five  scores.  2. QUICK FIRE.--10 yards. Minimum of one maximum of three scores.  3. AUTOMATIC FIRE.--10 yards. Minimum of one maximum of three scores.  4. TRENCH FIRE.--Minimum of one maximum of three scores.      Bayonet Training.    A. THE FUNCTIONS OF BAYONET TRAINING ARE:       1. To teach the correct use of the bayonet until it becomes        instinctive.     2. To develop the fighting spirit.     3. To develop speed, accuracy, and cooerdination.    B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES:       1. Fencing, in modern combat, is out of the question. Almost every        fight will consist of but one or two motions. Hence the class        must be taught that the best defence is the quickest offensive.     2. Every available means of offence, with hands and feet as well as        with rifle and bayonet, is a part of bayonet training.     3. Teamwork is essential. Men must be taught, especially in the        combat, to exercise, to seize every opportunity to act together.     4. Personal control during combat, especially at night, will be        nearly impossible. Control should be practiced, therefore, in        the form of clear instructions delivered to the men before        assault, and fulfilled individually.     5. In every assault and combat exercise, the men must be taught        never to leave an enemy alive, or who may be alive, behind them.    C. TECHNIQUE OF BAYONET COMBAT:       1. The _point_ is the main reliance. Its use should be practiced        in every possible situation, until a correct choice or        combination of long point, short point, and jab, and the        execution thereof, becomes a matter of instinct.     2. The point must always be directed at a definite target. The most        vulnerable points of the body are: Lower abdomen, base of the        neck, small of the back (on either side of the spine), chest,        and thighs. Bony parts of the trunk must be avoided by accurate        aim.     3. The use of the rifle as a club, swinging or striking, is        valuable only:        a. When the point is not available.        b. In sudden encounters at close quarters, when a sharp butt           swing to the crotch may catch an opponent unguarded.        c. After parrying a swinging butt blow, when a butt strike to           the jaw is often the quickest possible riposte.        The use of butt swings overhead or sidewise to the head or        neck, is to be avoided; they are slow, inaccurate, easily        parried or side-stepped, and leave the whole body unguarded.        After every butt blow a thrust must immediately follow, since        no butt blow, of itself, is apt to be fatal.     4. The parries must be regarded and practiced chiefly as means of        opening the opponent's guard; hence, a thrust must immediately        follow each parry.     5. The foot movements shown in the old manual are useful only to        promote quickness and steadiness. They should, therefore, be        practiced in combination with the points and butt blows, and so        combined can be executed in the oblique directions as well as at        right angles. The left foot moves in the direction of the        thrust.    D. MANUAL OF THE BAYONET: There are only 7 exercises to learn in the        new bayonet drill:       1. _Guard_.--Point of the bayonet directed at the opponent's        throat, the rifle held easily and naturally with both hands,        barrel inclined slightly to the left, right hand at the height        of the navel and grasping the small of the stock, left hand        holding the rifle at a convenient position above the lower        band, so that the left arm is slightly bent, making an angle of        about 150 degrees. The legs should be well separated and in an        easy position."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14648"],[0,"Bij de Parsi's van Bombay en Gudsjerat (#20)"],[1,"igheden, zooals de bezoeken van den geest  van den heiligen Vijgeboom, die in den nacht, in het wit gekleed en  geschoeid met sandalen, zijn geloovigen vertroost. Zijn zending heeft  ten doel, goed te doen, en men verkrijgt zijn gunst door eenvoudige  offeranden van melk en bloemen neer te leggen aan den voet van den  boom, waar hij zich heet terug te trekken overdag.    Wij verlieten Surate, om een kort uitstapje te maken naar Kathiawar;  maar we kwamen er nog dikwijls terug, en we hebben er altijd iets  bekoorlijks gevonden, dat zeker te danken was aan mijn studiën,  maar denkelijk ook aan onze herinneringen, die ons terugvoerden naar  den tijd, toen leden van onze familie de factorijen bewoonden van  Saudagarvar. Dikwijls heeft het ons geschenen, dat de lucht, die we  inademden, te Surate lichter was dan elders in Indië, en wij hebben  er soms een visioen gehad als van dingen die we reeds hadden gezien,  en een gevoel van iets, dat we reeds hadden beleefd.    Thans is onze reis afgeloopen, en ons program is uitgevoerd. Wij  hebben de Parsi's bezocht in de middelpunten, waar ze het talrijkst  zijn en het meest welvaart genieten, en in hun oude residenties;  ze wonen niet allen in het beperkte gebied van Gudsjerat.    Daarin verschillen ze veel van de Hindoes, dat ze van verre landen  hielden en van avontuurlijke tochten; zoo werden reeds in de 18de  eeuw vestingen van Parsi's aangetroffen op de kust van Koromandel, in  Birma en in China. In onze dagen vindt men ze op bijna alle plaatsen  van Indië, in Dekan zoowel als op de afghaansche grens en in Kashmir;  men kan hen ook ontmoeten in het Uiterste Oosten en op de kust van  Afrika, te Zanzibar bij voorbeeld. Wij hebben Aden reeds genoemd,  en inderdaad zijn de handelshuizen van die engelsche kolonie bijna  uitsluitend in handen van Parsi's.    Wat het Westen aangaat, ze worden ertoe aangetrokken ten eerste  terwille van hun zaken en dan door de examens, die ze verplicht zijn  in Engeland te komen afleggen, als ze in den dienst der regeering  willen treden. Voor het overige haken ze, afgezien van die practische  overwegingen, in het algemeen naar onze beschaving en naar onze wijze  van werken. Het resultaat van deze strooming is een sterke trek naar  het individualisme, wat zou kunnen doen vreezen, dat de gemeenschap,  zoo langen tijd één en ongedeeld, den samenhang gaat verliezen,  waarin voor vele eeuwen haar kracht heeft gelegen.    Die nieuwe behoeften hebben zich reeds vele jaren laten gevoelen onder  de Parsi's, vooral door hun aanraking met Europeanen en Amerikanen;  maar hun betrekkingen met de Japanners, die van den laatsten tijd  dagteekenen, hebben nog wijder horizons voor hen geopend. Het succes  van die laatsten heeft ons het ontwaken doen bijwonen van de slapende  kracht der aziatische volken, en sommige Parsi's met een helderen  geest achten het tegenwoordig mogelijk, dat ze zich bij die nieuwe  beweging kunnen aansluiten en toch oosterlingen blijven."]]]
