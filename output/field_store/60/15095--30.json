Real., Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 24. - Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y  Conq., Ms.    \"Tenian un Jardin que los Terrones eran pedazos de oro fino y  estaban artificiosamente sembrado de maizales los quales eran oro  asi las Canas de ello como las ojas y mazorcas, y estaban tan  bien plantados que aunque hiciesen recios bientos no se  arrancaban.

Some of  the statements, through credulity, and others, in the desire of  exciting admiration, may be greatly exaggerated; but, in the  coincidence of contemporary testimony, it is not easy to  determine the exact line which should mark the measure of our  skepticism.  Certain it is, that the glowing picture I have given  is warranted by those who saw these buildings in their pride, or  shortly after they had been despoiled by the cupidity of their  countrymen.  Many of the costly articles were buried by the  natives, or thrown into the waters of the rivers and the lakes;  but enough remained to attest the unprecedented opulence of these  religious establishments.  Such things as were in their nature  portable were speedily removed, to gratify the craving of the  Conquerors, who even tore away the solid cornices and frieze of  gold from the great temple, filling the vacant places with the  cheaper, but - since it affords no temptation to avarice - more  durable, material of plaster.  Yet even thus shorn of their  splendor, the venerable edifices still presented an attraction to  the spoiler, who found in their dilapidated walls an  inexhaustible quarry for the erection of other buildings.  On the  very ground once crowned by the gorgeous Coricancha rose the  stately church of St. Dominic, one of the most magnificent  structures of the New World.  Fields of maize and lucerne now  bloom on the spot which glowed with the golden gardens of the  temple; and the friar chants his orisons within the consecrated  precincts once occupied by the Children of the Sun. *22    [Footnote 22: Miller's Memoirs, vol. II. pp. 223, 224.]    Besides the great temple of the Sun, there was a large number of  inferior temples and religious houses in the Peruvian capital and  its environs, amounting, as is stated, to three or four hundred.  *23 For Cuzco was a sanctified spot, venerated not only as the  abode of the Incas, but of all those deities who presided over  the motley nations of the empire.  It was the city beloved of the  Sun; where his worship was maintained in its splendor; \"where  every fountain, pathway, and wall,\" says an ancient chronicler,  \"was regarded as a holy mystery.\" *24 And unfortunate was the  Indian noble who, at some period or other of his life, had not  made his pilgrimage to the Peruvian Mecca.    [Footnote 23: Herrera, Hist. General, dec 5, lib. 4, cap. 8.  \"Havia en aquella ciudad y legua y media de la redonda  quatrocientos y tantos lugares, donde se hacian sacrificious, y  se gastava mucha suma de hacienda en ellos.\" Ondegardo, Rel.  Prim., Ms.]    [Footnote 24: \"Que aquella ciudad del Cuzco era casa y morada de  Dioses, e ansi no habia en toda ella fuente ni paso ni pared que  no dixesen que tenia misterio.\" Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms.]    Other temples and religious dwellings were scattered over the  provinces; and some of them constructed on a scale of  magnificence, that almost rivalled that of the metropolis.  The  attendants on these composed an army of themselves.  The whole  number of functionaries, including those of the sacerdotal order,  who officiated at the Coricancha alone, was no less than four  thousand. *25    [Footnote 25: Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.    An army, indeed, if, as Cieza de Leon states, the number of  priests and menials employed in the famous temple of Bilcas, on  the route to Chili, amounted to 40,000!  (Cronica, cap. 89.)  Every thing relating to these Houses of the Sun appears to have  been on a grand scale.  But we may easily believe this a clerical  error for 4,000.]    At the head of all, both here and throughout the land, stood the  great High-Priest, or Villac Vmu, as he was called.  He was  second only to the Inca in dignity, and was usually chosen from  his brothers or nearest kindred.  He was appointed by the  monarch, and held his office for life; and he, in turn, appointed  to all the subordinate stations of his own order.  This order was  very numerous.  Those members of it who officiated in the House  of the Sun, in Cuzco, were taken exclusively from the sacred race  of the Incas.  The ministers in the provincial temples were drawn  from the families of the curacas; but the office of high-priest  in each district was reserved for one of the blood royal.  It was  designed by this regulation to preserve the faith in its purity,  and to guard against any departure from the stately ceremonial  which it punctiliously prescribed. *26    [Footnote 26: Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 27. - Conq i Pob.  del Piru, Ms.    It was only while the priests were engaged in the service of the  temples, that they were maintained, according to Garcilasso, from  the estates of the Sun.  At other times, they were to get their  support from their own lands, which, if he is correct, were  assigned to them in the same manner as to the other orders of the  nation.  Com Real., Parte 1, lib. 5, cap. 8]    The sacerdotal order, though numerous, was not distinguished by  any peculiar badge or costume from the rest of the nation.  Neither was it the sole depository of the scanty science of the  country, nor was it charged with the business of instruction, nor  with those parochial duties, if they may so be called, which  bring the priest in contact with the great body of the people, -  as was the case in Mexico.  The cause of this peculiarity may  probably be traced to the existence of a superior order, like  that of the Inca nobles, whose sanctity of birth so far  transcended all human appointments, that they in a manner  engrossed whatever there was of religious veneration in the  people.  They were, in fact, the holy order of the state.  Doubtless, any of them might, as very many of them did, take on  themselves the sacerdotal functions; and their own insignia and  peculiar privileges were too well understood to require any  further badge to separate them from the people.  The duties of the priest were confined to ministration in the  temple. Even here his attendance was not constant, as he was  relieved after a stated interval by other brethren of his order,  who succeeded one another in regular rotation.  His science was  limited to an acquaintance with the fasts and festivals of his  religion, and the appropriate ceremonies which distinguished  them.  This, however frivolous might be its character, was no  easy acquisition; for the ritual of the Incas involved a routine  of observances, as complex and elaborate as ever distinguished  that of any nation, whether pagan or Christian.  Each month had  its appropriate festival, or rather festivals.  The four  principal had reference to the Sun, and commemorated the great  periods of his annual progress, the solstices and equinoxes.  Perhaps the most magnificent of all the national solemnities was  the feast of Raymi, held at the period of the summer solstice,  when the Sun, having touched the southern extremity of his  course, retraced his path, as if to gladden the hearts of his  chosen people by his presence.  On this occasion, the Indian  nobles from the different quarters of the country thronged to the  capital to take part in the great religious celebration.    For three days previous, there was a general fast, and no fire  was allowed to be lighted in the dwellings.  When the appointed  day arrived, the Inca and his court, followed by the whole  population of the city, assembled at early dawn in the great  square to greet the rising of the Sun.  They were dressed in  their gayest apparel, and the Indian lords vied with each other  in the display of costly ornaments and jewels on their persons,  while canopies of gaudy feather-work and richly tinted stuffs,  borne by the attendants over their heads, gave to the great  square, and the streets that emptied into it, the appearance of  being spread over with one vast and magnificent awning.  Eagerly  they watched the coming of their deity, and, no sooner did his  first yellow rays strike the turrets and loftiest buildings of  the capital, than a shout of gratulation broke forth from the  assembled multitude, accompanied by songs of triumph, and the  wild melody of barbaric instruments, that swelled louder and  louder as his bright orb, rising above the mountain range towards  the east, shone in full splendor on his votaries. After the usual  ceremonies of adoration, a libation was offered to the great  deity by the Inca, from a huge golden vase, filled with the  fermented liquor of maize or of maguey, which, after the monarch  had tasted it himself, he dispensed among his royal kindred.  These ceremonies completed, the vast assembly was arranged in  order of procession,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#20)"],[1,"1857, and the second in 1861. In these the results of a  vast amount of reading are shown; but they are not free from one-sided  views and generalisations resting on insufficient data. He has, however,  the credit of having contributed a new idea of history and the method of  writing it. The completed work was to have extended to 14 vols. B. was  one of the greatest chess-players in Europe.      BUDGELL, EUSTACE (1686-1737).--Miscellaneous writer, _ed._ at Oxf., was a  cousin of Addison, who took him to Ireland and got him appointed to a  lucrative office, which, however, he was foolish enough to throw away by  lampooning the Viceroy. He assisted A. in the _Spectator_, of which he  wrote 37 numbers signed X. In these he imitates A.'s style with some  success. B., who was vain and vindictive, fell on evil days, lost a  fortune in the South Sea Bubble, was accused of forging a will, and  committed suicide by throwing himself out of a boat at London Bridge.      BULL, GEORGE (1634-1710).--Theologian, _b._ at Wells, _ed._ at Tiverton  and Oxf., took orders, was ordained by an ejected bishop in 1658, and  received the living of Suddington near Bristol. He was a strong Royalist,  and was privy to a scheme for bringing back the Royal family. After the  Restoration he obtained further preferment, and became in 1704 Bishop of  St. David's at an age when his strength had become unequal to any very  active discharge of the duties of his see. He has a high place among  Anglican theologians, and as a defender of the doctrine of the Trinity  was held in high esteem even by Continental Romanist controversialists.  Among his works are _Harmonia Apostolica_ (1669-70) in which he  endeavoured to reconcile alleged discrepancies between the teaching of  St. Paul and St. James on the relation between faith and works, in which  he assigned to the latter the higher authority, _Defensio Fidei Nicaenae_  (1685) and _Corruptions of the Church of Rome_.      BULWER, E.L., (_see_ LYTTON.)      BUNYAN, JOHN (1628-1688).--_B._ at Elstow, near Bedford, the _s._ of a  poor tinker, was _ed._ at a free school, after which he worked at his  father's trade. At 17 he was drafted as a soldier in the Civil War, and  served for two years at Newport Pagnell. At 19 he _m._ a pious young  woman, whose only dowry appears to have been two books, the _Plain Man's  Pathway to Heaven_ and the _Practice of Piety_, by which he was  influenced towards a religious life. In his autobiographical book, _Grace  Abounding_, B. describes himself as having led an abandoned life in his  youth; but there appears to be no evidence that he was, outwardly at any  rate, worse than the average of his neighbours: the only serious fault  which he specifies is profanity, others being dancing and bell-ringing.  The overwhelming power of his imagination led him to contemplate acts of  impiety and profanity, and to a vivid realisation of the dangers these  involved. In particular he was harassed by a curiosity in regard to the  \"unpardonable sin,\" and a prepossession that he had already committed it.  He continually heard voices urging him to \"sell Christ,\" and was tortured  by fearful visions. After severe spiritual conflicts he escaped from this  condition, and became an enthusiastic and assured believer. In 1657 he  joined the Baptist Church, began to preach, and in 1660 was committed to  Bedford Jail, at first for three months, but on his refusing to conform,  or to desist from preaching, his confinement was extended with little  interval for a period of nearly 12 years, not always, however, very  rigorous. He supported his family (wife and four children, including a  blind girl) by making tagged laces, and devoted all the time he could  spare from this to studying his few books and writing. During this period  he wrote among other things, _The Holy City_ and _Grace Abounding_. Under  the Declaration of Indulgence he was released in 1672, and became a  licensed preacher. In 1675 the Declaration was cancelled, and he was,  under the Conventicle Act, again imprisoned for six months, during which  he wrote the first part of _The Pilgrim's Progress_, which appeared in  1678, and to which considerable additions were made in subsequent  editions. It was followed by the _Life and Death of Mr. Badman_ (1680),  _The Holy War_ (1682), and the second part of _The Pilgrim's Progress_  (1684). B. was now widely known as a popular preacher and author, and  exercised a wide influence. In 1688 he set out on a journey to mediate  between a father and son, in which he was successful. On the return  journey he was drenched with rain, caught a chill and _d._ in London on  August 31. He is buried in Bunhill Fields. B. has the distinction of  having written, in _The Pilgrim's Progress_, probably the most widely  read book in the English language, and one which has been translated into  more tongues than any book except the Bible. The charm of the work, which  makes it the joy of old and young, learned and ignorant, and of readers  of all possible schools of thought and theology, lies in the interest of  a story in which the intense imagination of the writer makes characters,  incidents, and scenes alike live in that of his readers as things  actually known and remembered by themselves, in its touches of tenderness  and quaint humour, its bursts of heart-moving eloquence, and its pure,  nervous, idiomatic English, Macaulay has said, \"Every reader knows the  straight and narrow path as well as he knows a road on which he has been  backwards and forwards a hundred times,\" and he adds that \"In England  during the latter half of the seventeenth century there were only two  minds which possessed the imaginative faculty in a very eminent degree.  One of these minds produced the _Paradise Lost_, the other _The Pilgrim's  Progress_.\" B. wrote about 60 books and tracts, of which _The Holy War_  ranks next to _The Pilgrim's Progress_ in popularity, while _Grace  Abounding_ is one of the most interesting pieces of biography in  existence.    There are numerous Lives, the most complete being that by Dr. John Brown  of Bedford (1885 new 1888): others are Southey's (1830), on which  Macaulay's _Essay_ is based, Offor (1862), Froude (1880). On _The  Pilgrim's Progress, The People of the Pilgrimage_, by J. Kerr Bain, D.D.      BURCKHARDT, JOHN LEWIS (1784-1817).--Traveller, _b._ at Lausanne and  _ed._ in Germany, came to England in 1806 and wrote his books of travel  in English. He travelled widely in Africa and in Syria, and the adjoining  countries, became a great oriental scholar, and, disguising himself, made  the pilgrimage to Mecca, and obtained access to places not open to  Christians. He wrote accounts of his travels, and a book on Arabic  proverbs. He _d._ of dysentery at Cairo when about to start on a new  journey into the interior of Africa.      BURKE, EDMUND (1729-1797).--Statesman, orator, and political philosopher,  was the _s._ of an attorney in Dublin, where he was _b._ His _f._ was a  Protestant, but his mother, whose maiden name was Nagle, was a Roman  Catholic. He received his early _ed._ at a Quaker school at Ballitore,  and in 1743 proceeded to Trinity Coll., Dublin, where he graduated in  1748. His _f._ wished him to study for the law, and with this object he,  in 1750, went to London and entered the Middle Temple. He, however,  disliked law and spent more time in literary pursuits than in legal  study. In 1756 his first _pub._ work appeared, _A Vindication of Natural  Society_, a satire on the views of Bolingbroke, but so close was the  imitation of that writer's style, and so grave the irony, that its point  as a satire was largely missed. In the same year he _pub._ his famous  treatise _On the Sublime and Beautiful_, which attracted universal  attention, and three years later (1759) he projected with Dodsley the  publisher _The Annual Register_, for which he continued to write the  yearly Survey of Events until 1788. About the same time he was introduced  to W.G. Hamilton (known as Single-speech H.) then about to go to Ireland  as Chief Sec., and accompanied him in the capacity of private sec., in  which he remained for three years. In 1765 he became private sec. to the  Marquis of Rockingham, the Whig statesman, then Prime Minister, who  became his fast friend until his death. At the same time he entered  Parliament as member for Wendover, and began his brilliant career as an  orator and philosophic statesman. The first great subject in which he  interested himself was the controversy with the American colonies, which  soon developed into war and ultimate separation, and in 1769 he _pub._,  in reply to G. Grenville, his pamphlet on _The Present State of the  Nation_. In the same year he purchased the small estate of Gregories near  Beaconsfield. His speeches and writings had now made him famous, and  among other effects had brought about the suggestion that he was the  author of the _Letters of Junius_. It was also about this time that he  became one of the circle which, including Goldsmith, Garrick, etc., had  Johnson for its central luminary. In 1770 appeared _Thoughts on the  Causes of the Present Discontent_, directed against the growth of the  Royal power on the one hand, and of faction on the other. In 1774 he was  elected member for Bristol, and continued so until 1780, when differences  with his constituency on the questions of Irish trade and Catholic  emancipation led to his resignation, after which he sat for Malton until  his final retirement from public life. Under the administration of Lord  North (1770-1782) the American war went on from bad to worse, and it was  in part owing to the splendid oratorical efforts of B. that it was at  last brought to an end. To this period belong two of his most brilliant  performances, his speech on _Conciliation with America_ (1775), and his  _Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol_ (1777).
