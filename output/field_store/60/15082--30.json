The crackling of the flames was heard in the village, and  the smell of smoke was occasionally quite unpleasant.    A timely rain generally puts a stop to the mischief; but parties of  men are also sent out into the woods to \"fight the fire.\" They tread  out the flames among the dry leaves by trampling them down, and they  rake away the combustible materials, to confine the enemy to its  old grounds, when it soon exhausts itself. The flames spread more  frequently along the earth, than from tree to tree.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    FLOWERS.      Dear friend, love well the flowers! Flowers are the sign    Of Earth's all gentle love, her grace, her youth,    Her endless, matchless, tender gratitude.    When the Sun smiles on thee--why thou art glad:    But when the Earth he smileth, _She_ bursts forth    In beauty like a bride, and gives him back,    In sweet repayment for his warm bright love,    A world of flowers. You may see them born,    On any day in April, moist or dry,    As bright as are the Heavens that look on them:    Some sown like stars upon the greensward; some    As yellow as the sunrise; others red    As day is when he sets; reflecting thus,    In pretty moods, the bounties of the sky.      And now, of all fair flowers, which lovest thou best?    The Rose? She is a queen more wonderful    Than any who have bloomed on Orient thrones:    Sabaean Empress! in her breast, though small,    Beauty and infinite sweetness sweetly dwell,    Inextricable. Or dost dare prefer    The Woodbine, for her fragrant summer breath?    Or Primrose, who doth haunt the hours of Spring,    A wood-nymph brightening places lone and green?    Or Cowslip? or the virgin Violet,    That nun, who, nestling in her cell of leaves,    Shrinks from the world, in vain!      Yet, wherefore choose, when Nature doth not choose?    Our mistress, our preceptress? _She_ brings forth    Her brood with equal care, loves all alike,    And to the meanest as the greatest yields    Her sunny splendors and her fruitful rains.    Love _all_ flowers, then. Be sure that wisdom lies    In every leaf and bloom; o'er hills and dales;    And thymy mountains; sylvan solitudes    Where sweet-voiced waters sing the long year through;    In every haunt beneath the Eternal Sun,    Where Youth or Age sends forth its grateful prayer,    Or thoughtful Meditation deigns to stray.           *       *       *       *       *    French Eulogy has always been prone to run riot. One M. Philoxene  Boyer, in a grave work which has just published, in Paris, thus  addresses Victor Hugo:--\"You, Victor Hugo, will become not only  President of the French Republic, but President of the Universal  Republic, Chief of the Oecumenic Council of Nations, Intellectual Pope  reigning in your Paris, whilst the Pope of Religion, united with you  and Jesus Christ, the common master, will continue to reign in his  Rome.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"characters, in which it appears in the volume  given to Mrs. Thompson, which is herewith reproduced in facsimile as a  specimen of one of the grotesque fancies Field indulged:    [Illustration: \"THE PEAR\" IN FIELD'S \"GREEK\" TEXT.]    For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the Greek characters, I have  retranslated this poem into corresponding English, which the reader can  compare with his version of \"The Little Peach.\"      _THE PEAR      (In English Equivalent.)

He went to the capital of Colorado the most  indefatigable merry-maker that ever turned night into day, a  past-master in the art of mimicry, the most inveterate practical joker  that ever violated the proprieties of friendship, time, and occasion to  raise a laugh or puncture a fraud. As his friend of those days, E.D.  Cowen, has written, \"as a farceur and entertainer no professional could  surpass him.\"    Field was tempted to go to Denver by the offer of the managing  editorship of the Tribune, which was owned and controlled by the  railroad and political coalition then dominant in Colorado. It was run  on a scale of extravagance out of all proportion to its legitimate  revenue, its newspaper functions being altogether subordinate to  services as a railroad ally and political organ. The late O.H.  Rothacker, one of the ablest and most versatile writers in the country,  was at the head of its editorial staff, and Fred J.V. Skiff, now head  of the Field Columbian Museum, was its business manager. These men,  with Field, were given carte blanche to surround themselves with a  staff and news-gathering equipment to make the Tribune \"hum.\" And they  did make it hum, so that the humming was heard far beyond the borders  of the centennial state.    In studying the character of Eugene Field and his doings in Denver, it  must be borne in mind that we are considering a period in the life of  that city years ago, when the conditions were very different from those  prevailing there now or from those to be met with to-day in any other  large city in the country. Denver in 1881 was very much what San  Francisco was under the influence of the gold rush of the early  fifties, only complicated with the struggles of rival railway  companies. All the politics, railway, and mining interests of the newly  created state centred in Denver. The city was alive with the throbbing  energy of strife and speculation over mines, railway grants, and  political power. Life was rapid, boisterous, and rough. Nothing had  settled into the conventional grooves of habit. The whole community was  fearless in its gayety. It had not learned to affect the sobriety and  demureness of stupidity lest its frivolity should be likened to the  crackling of thorns under a pot.    Into this civilization of the mining camp and smelter, just emerging  into that of the railway, political, and financial centre of a vast and  wealthy territory, came Eugene Field at the age of thirty-one, as free  from care, warm-hearted, and open-handed as the most reckless  adventurer in Colorado. Although a husband and a father, devoted as  ever to his family, he threw himself into the bohemian life of Denver  with the abandon of a youth of twenty. It is almost inconceivable where  Field found the time and strength for the whirl of work and play in  which there was no let up during his two years' stay in Denver. His  duties as managing editor of the Tribune would have taxed the energies  and resources of the strongest man, for he did not spare himself to  fulfil the purpose of his engagement--to make the paper \"hum.\" He  mapped out and directed the work of the staff with a comprehensive  shrewdness and keen appreciation of what his public, as well as his  employers, wanted that left no room for criticism. He kept the whole  city guessing what sensation or reputation would be exploded next in  the Tribune.    But he did not confine himself to the duties of directing the work of  others. He started a column headed \"Odds and Ends,\" to which he was the  principal and, by all odds, the most frequent contributor. He had not  been in the city many months before he began the occasional publication  of those skits which, under the title of \"The Tribune Primer,\" were  gathered into his first unpretentious book of forty-eight pages, and  which in its original form is now one of the most sought after quarries  of the American bibliomaniac. Writing of these sketches in 1894, he  said:      The little sketches appeared in the Denver Tribune in the Fall of    1881 and winter of 1882. The whole number did not exceed fifty. I    quit writing them because all the other newspapers in the country    began imitating the project.    In fact the series began October 10th, 1881, and ended December 19th of  the same year. Edward B. Morgan, of Denver, in an introductory note to  a few of the sketches omitted from the original \"Tribune Primer,\"  printed in the Cornhill Booklet for January, 1901, gives the following  version of how the skits began:      Of the origin of these sketches a story is told--although the writer    cannot vouch for it--that on the Sunday evening preceding their first    publication the \"printer's devil\" was dispatched post-haste to    Field's home for copy which his happy-go-lucky manner of working had    not produced. We may perhaps picture him engaged in what was always    nearest and dearest to his heart, the amusement of his children, and    perhaps reading to them or more likely composing for them primer    sketches which he on the spur of the moment parodied for older    readers. He has probably expressed his own feelings in the third one    of the skits which he then wrote:      THE REPORTER ON SUNDAY      Is this Sunday? Yes, it is a Sunday. How peaceful and quiet it is.    But who is the man? He does not look peaceful. He is a reporter and    he is swearing. What makes him swear? Because he has to work on    Sunday? Oh no! he is swearing because he has to Break the Fourth    Commandment. It is a sad thing to be a Reporter.    According to Mr. Cowen, however, the inspiration of the primer  compositions was a libel suit brought against the Tribune by Governor  Evans. In ridiculing the governor and his action Field three times used  the old primer method--with illustrations after the fashion of John  Phoenix--and the success of these little sarcasms undoubtedly  encouraged him to elaborate the idea. Field also had a column of  unsigned verse and storyettes in the Tribune under the heading, \"For  the Little Folks.\"    Mr. Morgan discredits Field's statement that the whole number of the  Primers issued did not exceed fifty, because of the unlikelihood of  printing such a small edition of a book to be sold for twenty-five  cents and advertising it daily a month in advance, with a foot-note,  \"Trade supplied at Special Rates.\" Which merely shows that Mr. Morgan  applied to Field's acts the same rule of thumb that would be applicable  to ninety-nine out of a hundred reasonable publishers. But Field was a  rule unto himself, and he could be counted on to be the one hundredth  and unique individual where the other ninety-and-nine were orthodox and  conventional. The fact that only seven or eight copies of the original  Primer are known to book collectors tends to confirm Field's statement,  which receives side light and support from his suggestion to Francis  Wilson that the first edition of \"Echoes from the Sabine Farm,\" which  Mr. Wilson issued in such sumptuous form nearly ten years later, should  consist of only fifty copies, and that each of the two should reserve  one and that they should \"burn the other forty-eight.\"    I have not the slightest doubt that the same disposition was made of  all copies of \"The Tribune Primer\" over the first fifty, which were  supplied to the favored few at \"Special Rates.\" This was just such a  freak as would have occurred to Field, and in Denver there was no  restraint upon the act following upon any wild thought that flitted  through his topsy-turvy brain.    The jocose spirit in which Field at this time viewed the methods,  duties, and responsibilities of journalism may be gleaned from the  following specimens taken at random from his \"Tribune Primer\" sketches:      THE REPORTER      What is that I see? That, my Child, is the News Interviewer and he is    now interviewing a Man. But where is the Man? I can see no Man. The    Man, my Child, is in his Mind.
