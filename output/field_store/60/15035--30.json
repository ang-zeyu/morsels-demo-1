They are  bunches of little red berries, and very refreshing: the Moors are very fond  of them, and make great use of them.[34]    During this time, chance ordered it, that Mr. Rogery, who had also been  taken by the Moors, stopped at the same place: he was brought by some of  the natives, who were taking him also to their sovereign Zaide: he soon  perceived Mr. Kummer lying with his face to the earth, and thought he was  dead; at this sight, a mortal chillness pervaded all the limbs of the  unfortunate Rogery; he deplored the loss of a friend, of a companion in  misfortune: he approached him trembling; but his grief was soon changed  into joy, when he perceived that his friend still breathed; he took hold of  him, and embraced him eagerly. These two unfortunate men were transported  with mutual joy, at meeting in the midst of their distress, with a fellow  countryman. Mr. Rogery had lost every thing; they had taken from him about  forty pieces of 20 francs each, his watch, and all his effects: he had  nothing left but his shirt, a very bad pair of pantaloons, and a hat. The  wives of the Moors, and still more the children, had greatly tormented him;  the latter, continually pinched him, and hindered him from taking a  moment's sleep. His character was remarkably soured by this treatment, and  his faculties rather impaired. These two unfortunate men, after having  related their distresses to each other, fell asleep close together; some  hours after, the Moors returned, and gave them some of the berries we have  before mentioned. The caravan soon set forward again, and took a _South  West_ direction, which led to the camp of King Zaide: they reached it in  the evening, but the monarch was absent; the report of our shipwreck had  reached his camp, and Zaide, who desires to see every thing himself, had  gone to the sea-shore to have assistance given to such of the persons  shipwrecked, as he should meet with. The King did not return till  twenty-four hours after, which gave time for our travellers to repose, and  for Prince Muhammed to make a bargain with the two whites: to conduct them  to the Isle of St. Louis; the Prince demanded for his trouble, including  the expences of provisions and travelling, 800 gourdes for each, and  obliged them before they set out, to sign an agreement in the Arabic  language: Mr. Kummer consented to it, and said to Mr. Rogery, when we have  once got to St. Louis, we will give them what we please. The latter  hesitated, being much more scrupulous on that point, he would not at first  accede to an agreement which he feared he should not be able to perform;  but seeing that the Moors were resolved to keep him among them, he  consented to accept the absolute proposal of the Prince, and the  conventions were signed.    Our two travellers passed a part of their time in examining the customs of  these people; we shall mention some circumstances which particularly struck  them. They observed, that the children imperiously command their fathers  and mothers: but especially the latter, who never oppose their  inclinations; hence, doubtless comes that despotic spirit, which is carried  to the extreme; a refusal, or a delay, in the executions of their orders  irritates them, and their anger is so violent that in the first transport,  the unhappy slave who may have excited their fury, runs the risk of being  stabbed on the spot. Hence, too doubtless the manly boldness which  characterises them, and which seems to inspire those who surround them,  with respect and submission. The Moors are, in every respect, much superior  to the Negroes: braver than they are, they reduce them to slavery, and  employ them in the hardest labour; they are, in general, tall and well  made, and their faces are very handsome, and full of expression.    However, it may also be observed that the Moors of both sexes, appear at  the first sight, like a people composed of two distinct races, which have  nothing in common, except, the extremely brown, or tanned colour of their  skin, and the shining black of their hair. The greater part of them, it is  true, are endowed with the stature, and the noble, but austere features,  which call to mind some of the great Italian painters, but there are  several, (indeed the smaller number) whose cranium and profile form a  singular contrast with the others. Their head is remarkably elongated, the  ears small: the forehead, which, in the first, is very high and finely  formed, is contracted in the latter, and becomes at the top disagreeably  protuberant; their eyes are sunk, and placed as it were obliquely, which  gives them the savage look with which they are reproached, and their lower  jaw has a tendency to be elongated. Some of them have, it is true, the high  forehead of the former: but it always differs by being sunk in at the base.  These latter are, perhaps, the descendants of the aborigines of this  country, whose characteristic features are still discernible,  notwithstanding their alliance with so many strangers? History has, indeed,  transmitted to us some of the customs of the Numidians, who were by turns,  the enemies, and the allies of the Romans; but it has not condescended to  draw their portrait. Juvenal somewhere speaks of the withered hands of the  Moors: _manus ossea Mauri_. But, besides, that this is general in hot  countries, this description may be understood of ill-fed slaves.    The travellers remarked that there was no difference between the very  frugal diet of the slaves, who are all blacks, and that of their masters.  The fathers and mothers, as well as the marabous, (a kind of priests) pass  their leisure moments in teaching the principles of their religion, as well  as instructing them in reading and writing on the sand; the wives of King  Zaide, the number of whom is considerable, passively obey Fatima, who is  the favourite, or chief wife of the sovereign.    Our travellers estimated the number of men, women, children and slaves, at  seven or eight hundred persons; their flocks appeared to them very  numerous: they constitute part of the wealth of Zaide, who possesses a  great many besides, in different parts of the kingdom, the extent of which  is pretty considerable; it has about sixty leagues of coast, and stretches  to a great depth in the interior of the desert. The people, as we have  said, call themselves _Trasas_, and profess the Mahometan religion; they  hunt lions, tigers, leopards, and all other ferocious animals, which abound  in this part of Africa. Their commerce is in furs or skins, and ostrich  feathers: they manufacture the leather called basil, in french, basane,  which they prepare very well;[A11] they make this leather into pocketbooks,  to which they give different forms, but in general, that of a _sabretache_.  They also dress goats skins, and join several together to give them more  breadth; they are known under the name of _peaux de maures_, are excellent,  and afford a complete defence against the rain: in form, they nearly  resemble the dress of a Capuchin; they sell all these articles in the  interior, as well as goldsmiths work, which they manufacture with only a  hammer, and a little anvil; but their chief commerce, which is very  extensive, is in salt, which they carry to Tombuctoo, and to Sego, large  and very populous cities, situated in the interior of Africa. Sego is built  on both sides of the river Niger, and Tombuctoo not far from its banks, the  former about five hundred, and the latter about six hundred leagues East of  the Island of Goree. The Marabous, who are almost all traders, frequently  extend their journeys into Upper Egypt. The Moors and the Negroes, have an  extraordinary respect for these priests, who manufacture leather, into  little etuis, perfumed bags, and pocketbooks, to which they give the name  of _gris-gris_. By means of magic words spoken over the _gris-gris_, and  little notes written in Arabic, which they enclose in them, he who carries  such a one about him, is secure against the bite of wild beasts; they make  them to protect the wearer against lions, crocodiles, serpents, &c. They  sell them extremely dear, and those who possess them set a very high value  on them; the king and the princes are not less superstitious than those  whom they command. There are some who wear as many as twenty of these  _gris-gris_ fixed to the neck, the arms, and the legs.    After a day's stay, King Zaide arrived: he had no ornament which  distinguished him; but he was of a lofty stature, had an open countenance,  and three large teeth in the upper jaw, on the left side, which projected  at least two lines over the under lip, which the Moors consider as a great  beauty. He was armed with a large sabre, a poniard and a pair of pistols;  his soldiers had zagayes or lances, and little sabres in the Turkish  fashion. The King has always at his side, his favourite negro, who wears a  necklace of red pearls, and is called Billai. Zaide received the two whites  kindly, ordered that they should be well-treated, and that Mr. Rogery  should not be molested, he being continually tormented by the children. Mr.  Kummer was much more lively, and did not mind his misfortunes; he wrote  Arabic, and had passed himself off for the son of a Mahometan woman; all  this greatly pleased the Moors, who treated him well; while Mr. Rogery,  deeply affected by his misfortunes, and having just lost his last  resources, did not much rely on the good faith of the Moors.    In the course of the day, the King ordered Mr. Kummer to relate to him the  events of the last French revolution; he was already acquainted with those  of the first. Mr. Kummer did not exactly comprehend what the king wanted of  him. Zaide ordered his chief minister, to draw upon the sand, the map of  Europe, the Mediteranean, and the coast of Africa, along that sea: he  pointed out to him the Isle of Elba, and ordered him to relate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#20)"],[1," society upon whose borders she dwelled; she wondered how they lived,  where they lived, why they lived. The wet pavements were crowded with  nondescript humanity, the night was filled with the unmusical voices of  Hebrew hucksters, and the air laden with the smoky odor of their lamps.  Tramcars and motorbuses were packed unwholesomely with these children of  shadowland drawn together from the seven seas by the magnet of London.    She glanced at Pyne, but he was seemingly lost in abstraction, and  Kilfane appeared to be asleep. Mollie Gretna was staring eagerly out  on the opposite side of the car at a group of three dago sailors, whom  Mareno had nearly run down, but she turned at that moment and caught  Rita's glance.    \"Don't you simply love it!\" she cried. \"Some of those men were really  handsome, dear. If they would only wash I am sure I could adore them!\"    \"Even such charms as yours can be bought at too high a price,\" drawled  Sir Lucien. \"They would gladly do murder for you, but never wash.\"    Crossing Limehouse Canal, the car swung to the right into West India  Dock Road. The uproar of the commercial thoroughfare was left far  behind. Dark, narrow streets and sinister-looking alleys lay right and  left of them, and into one of the narrowest and least inviting of all  Mareno turned the car.    In the dimly-lighted doorway of a corner house the figure of a Chinaman  showed as a motionless silhouette.    \"Oh!\" sighed Mollie Gretna rapturously, \"a Chinaman! I begin to feel  deliciously sinful!\"    The car came to a standstill.    \"We get out here and walk,\" said Sir Lucien. \"It would not be wise to  drive further. Mareno will deliver our baggage by hand presently.\"    \"But we shall all be murdered,\" cried Mollie, \"murdered in cold blood! I  am dreadfully frightened!\"    \"Something of the kind is quite likely,\" drawled Sir Lucien, \"if you  draw attention to our presence in the neighborhood so deliberately.  Walk ahead, Kilfane, with Mollie. Rita and I will follow at a discreet  distance. Leave the door ajar.\"    Temporarily subdued by Pyne's icy manner, Miss Gretna became silent, and  went on ahead with Cyrus Kilfane, who had preserved an almost unbroken  silence throughout the journey. Rita and Sir Lucien followed slowly.    \"What a creepy neighborhood,\" whispered Rita. \"Look! Someone is standing  in that doorway over there, watching us.\"    \"Take no notice,\" he replied. \"A cat could not pass along this street  unobserved by the Chinese, but they will not interfere with us provided  we do not interfere with them.\"    Kilfane had turned to the right into a narrow court, at the entrance  to which stood an iron pillar. As he and his companion passed under the  lamp in a rusty bracket which projected from the wall, they vanished  into a place of shadows. There was a ceaseless chorus of distant  machinery, and above it rose the grinding and rattling solo of a steam  winch. Once a siren hooted apparently quite near them, and looking  upward at a tangled, indeterminable mass which overhung the street at  this point, Rita suddenly recognized it for a ship's bow-sprit.    \"Why,\" she said, \"we are right on the bank of the river!\"    \"Not quite,\" answered Pyne. \"We are skirting a dock basin. We are nearly  at our destination.\"    Passing in turn under the lamp, they entered the narrow court, and from  a doorway immediately on the left a faint light shone out upon the wet  pavement. Pyne pushed the door fully open and held it for Rita to enter.  As she did so:    \"Hello! hello!\" croaked a harsh voice. \"Number one p'lice chop, lo! Sin  Sin Wa!\"    The uncanny cracked voice proceeded to give an excellent imitation of a  police whistle, and concluded with that of the clicking of castanets.    \"Shut the door, Lucy,\" came the murmurous tones of Kilfane from the  gloom of the stuffy little room, in the centre of which stood a stove  wherefrom had proceeded the dim light shining out upon the pavement.  \"Light up, Sin Sin.\"    \"Sin Sin Wa! Sin Sin Wa!\" shrieked the voice, and again came the  rattling of imaginary castanets. \"Smartest leg in Buenos Ayres--Buenos  Ayres--p'lice chop--p'lice chop, lo!\"    \"Oh,\" whispered Mollie Gretna, in the darkness, \"I believe I am going to  scream!\"    Pyne closed the door, and a dimly discernible figure on the opposite  side of the room stooped and opened a little cupboard in which was a  lighted ship's lantern. The lantern being lifted out and set upon a  rough table near the stove, it became possible to view the apartment and  its occupants.    It was a small, low-ceiled place, having two doors, one opening upon the  street and the other upon a narrow, uncarpeted passage. The window was  boarded up. The ceiling had once been whitewashed and a few limp,  dark fragments of paper still adhering to the walls proved that some  forgotten decorator had exercised his art upon them in the past. A piece  of well-worn matting lay upon the floor, and there were two chairs, a  table, and a number of empty tea-chests in the room.    Upon one of the tea-chests placed beside the cupboard which had  contained the lantern a Chinaman was seated. His skin was of so light  a yellow color as to approximate to dirty white, and his face was  pock-marked from neck to crown. He wore long, snake-like moustaches,  which hung down below his chin. They grew from the extreme outer edges  of his upper lip, the centre of which, usually the most hirsute, was  hairless as the lip of an infant. He possessed the longest and thickest  pigtail which could possibly grow upon a human scalp, and his left eye  was permanently closed, so that a smile which adorned his extraordinary  countenance seemed to lack the sympathy of his surviving eye, which,  oblique, beady, held no mirth in its glittering depths.    The garments of the one-eyed Chinaman, who sat complacently smiling at  the visitors, consisted of a loose blouse, blue trousers tucked into  grey socks, and a pair of those native, thick-soled slippers which  suggest to a Western critic the acme of discomfort. A raven, black as  a bird of ebony, perched upon the Chinaman's shoulder, head a-tilt,  surveying the newcomers with a beady, glittering left eye which  strangely resembled the beady, glittering right eye of the Chinaman.  For, singular, uncanny circumstance, this was a one-eyed raven which sat  upon the shoulder of his one-eyed master!    Mollie Gretna uttered a stifled cry. \"Oh!\" she whispered. \"I knew I was  going to scream!\"    The eye of Sin Sin Wa turned momentarily in her direction, but otherwise  he did not stir a muscle.    \"Are you ready for us, Sin?\" asked Sir Lucien.    \"All ready. Lola hate gotchee topside loom ready,\" replied the Chinaman  in a soft, crooning voice.    \"Go ahead, Kilfane,\" directed Sir Lucien.    He glanced at Rita, who was standing very near him, surveying the evil  little room and its owner with ill-concealed disgust.    \"This is merely the foyer, Rita,\" he said, smiling slightly. \"The state  apartments are upstairs and in the adjoining house.\"    \"Oh,\" she murmured--and no more.    Kilfane and Mollie Gretna were passing through the inner doorway, and  Mollie turned.    \"Isn't it loathsomely delightful?\" she cried.    \"Smartest leg in Buenos Ayres!\" shrieked the raven. \"Sin Sin, Sin Sin!\"    Uttering a frightened exclamation, Mollie disappeared along the passage.  Sir Lucien indicated to Rita that she was to follow; and he, passing  through last of the party, closed the door behind him.    Sin Sin Wa never moved, and the raven, settling down upon the Chinaman's  shoulder, closed his serviceable eye.        CHAPTER XVII. THE BLACK SMOKE    Up an uncarpeted stair Cyrus Kilfane led the party, and into a kind of  lumber-room lighted by a tin oil lamp and filled to overflowing with  heterogeneous and unsavory rubbish. Here were garments, male and female,  no less than five dilapidated bowler hats, more tea-chests, broken  lamps, tattered fragments of cocoanut-matting, steel bed-laths and  straw mattresses, ruins of chairs--the whole diffusing an indescribably  unpleasant odor.    Opening a cupboard door, Kilfane revealed a number of pendent, ragged  garments, and two more bowler hats. Holding the garments aside, he  banged upon the back of the cupboard--three blows, a pause, and then two  blows.    Following a brief interval, during which even Mollie Gretna was held  silent by the strangeness of the proceedings.    \"Who is it?\" inquired a muffled voice.    \"Cy and the crowd,\" answered Kilfane.    Thereupon ensued a grating noise, and hats and garments swung suddenly  backward, revealing a doorway in which Mrs. Sin stood framed. She wore  a Japanese kimona of embroidered green silk and a pair of green and gold  brocaded slippers which possessed higher heels than Rita remembered to  have seen even Mrs. Sin mounted upon before. Her ankles were bare, and  it was impossible to determine in what manner she was clad beneath the  kimona. Undoubtedly she had a certain dark beauty, of a bold, abandoned  type.    \"Come right in,\" she directed. \"Mind your head, Lucy.\"    The quartette filed through into a carpeted corridor, and Mrs. Sin  reclosed the false back of the cupboard, which, viewed from the other  side, proved to be a door fitted into a recess in the corridor of the  adjoining house. This recess ceased to exist when a second and heavier  door was closed upon the first.    \"You know,\" murmured Kilfane, \"old Sin Sin has his uses, Lola. Those  doors are perfectly made.\"    \"Pooh!\" scoffed the woman, with a flash of her dark eyes; \"he is half a  ship's carpenter and half an ape!\"    She moved along the passage, her arm linked in that of Sir Lucien. The  others followed, and:    \"Is she truly married to that dreadful Chinaman?\" whispered Mollie  Gretna.    \"Yes, I believe so,\" murmured Kilfane. \"She is known as Mrs. Sin Sin  Wa.\"    \"Oh!\" Mollie's eyes opened widely. \"I almost envy her! I have read that  Chinamen tie their wives to beams"]]]
