This, O Krishna, is the eternal (source of) prosperity. When the fruits  of both knowledge and asceticism are seen, virtue and vice cannot be  fruitless. Call to thy mind, O Krishna, the circumstances of thy own  birth as thou that heard of them, and recall also the manner in which  Dhrishtadyumna of great prowess was born! These, O thou of sweet smiles,  are the best proofs (of the fruits of virtue)! They that have their  minds under control, reap the fruits of their acts and are content with  little. Ignorant fools are not content with even that much they get  (here), because they have no happiness born of virtue to acquire to in  the world hereafter. The fruitlessness of virtuous acts ordained in the  Vedas, as also of all transgressions, the origin and destruction of acts  are, O beautiful one, mysterious even to the gods. These are not known  to any body and everybody. Ordinary men are ignorant in respect of  these. The gods keep up the mystery, for the illusion covering the  conduct of the gods is unintelligible. Those regenerate ones that have  destroyed all aspirations, that have built all their hopes on vows and  asceticism, that have burnt all their sins and have acquired minds where  quest and peace and holiness dwell, understand all these. Therefore,  though you mayst not see the fruits of virtue, thou shouldst not yet  doubt religion or gods. Thou must perform sacrifices with a will, and  practise charity without insolence. Acts in this world have their  fruits, and virtue also is eternal. Brahma himself told this unto his  (spiritual) sons, as testified to by Kasyapa. Let thy doubt, therefore,  O Krishna, be dispelled like mist. Reflecting upon all this, let thy  scepticism give way to faith. Slander not God, who is the lord of all  creatures. Learn how to know him. Bow down unto him. Let not thy mind be  such. And, O Krishna, never disregard that Supreme Being through whose  grace mortal man, by piety, acquireth immortality!'\"      SECTION XXXII    \"Draupadi said, 'I do not ever disregard or slander religion, O son of  Pritha! Why should I disregard God, the lord of all creatures? Afflicted  with woe, know me, O Bharata, to be only raving. I will once more indulge  in lamentations; listen to me with attention. O persecutor of all  enemies, every conscious creature should certainly act in this world. It  is only the immobile, and not other creatures, that may live without  acting. The calf, immediately after its birth, sucketh the mothers's  teat. Persons feel pain in consequence of incantations performed with  their statues. It seemeth, therefore, O Yudhishthira, that creatures  derive the character of their lives from their acts of former lives.  Amongst mobile creatures man differeth in this respect that he aspireth,  O bull of the Bharata race, to affect his course of life in this and the  other world by means of his acts. Impelled by the inspiration of a  former life, all creatures visibly (reap) in this world the fruits of  their acts. Indeed, all creatures live according to the inspiration of a  former life, even the Creator and the Ordainer of the universe, like a  crane that liveth on the water (untaught by any one.) If a creature  acteth not, its course of life is impossible. In the case of a creature,  therefore, there must be action and not inaction. Thou also shouldest  act, and not incur censure by abandoning action. Cover thyself up, as  with an armour, with action. There may or may not be even one in a  thousand who truly knoweth the utility of acts or work. One must act for  protecting as also increasing his wealth; for if without seeking to  earn, one continueth to only spend, his wealth, even if it were a hoard  huge as Himavat, would soon be exhausted. All the creatures in the world  would have been exterminated, if there were no action. If also acts bore  no fruits, creatures would never have multiplied. It is even seen that  creatures sometimes perform acts that have no fruits, for without acts  the course of life itself would be impossible. Those persons in the  world who believe in destiny, and those again who believe in chance, are  both the worst among men. Those only that believe in the efficacy of  acts are laudable. He that lieth at ease, without activity, believing in  destiny alone, is soon destroyed like an unburnt earthen pot in water.  So also he that believeth in chance, i.e. sitteth inactive though  capable of activity liveth not long, for his life is one of weakness and  helplessness. If any person accidentally acquireth any wealth, it is  said he deriveth it from chance, for no one's effort hath brought about  the result. And, O son of Pritha, whatever of good fortune a person  obtaineth in consequence of religious rites, that is called  providential. The fruit, however that a person obtaineth by acting  himself, and which is the direct result of those acts of his, is  regarded as proof of personal ability. And, O best of men, know that the  wealth one obtaineth spontaneously and without cause is said to be a  spontaneous acquisition. Whatever is thus obtained by chance, by  providential dispensation, spontaneously, of as the result of one's acts  is, however, the consequence of the acts of a former life. And God, the  Ordainer of the universe, judging according to the acts of former lives,  distributeth among men their portions in this world. Whatever acts, good  or bad, a person performeth, know that they are the result of God's  arrangements agreeably to the acts of a former life. This body is only  the instruments in the hands of God, for doing the acts that are done.  Itself, inert, it doth as God urgeth it to do. O son of Kunti, it is the  Supreme Lord of all who maketh all creatures do what they do. The  creatures themselves are inert. O hero, man, having first settled some  purpose in his mind, accomplisheth it, himself working with the aid of  his intelligence. We, therefore, say that man is himself the cause (of  what he doeth). O bull among men, it is impossible to number the acts of  men, for mansions and towns are the result of man's acts. Intelligent  men know, by help of their intellect, that oil may be had from sesame,  curds from milk, and that food may be cooked by means of igniting fuel.  They know also the means for accomplishing all these. And knowing them,  they afterwards set themselves, with proper appliances, to accomplish  them. And creatures support their lives by the results achieved in these  directions by their own acts. If a work is executed by a skilled  workman, it is executed well. From differences (in characteristics),  another work may be said to be that of an unskilful hand. If a person  were not, in the matter of his acts, himself the cause thereof, then  sacrifices would not bear any fruits in his case nor would any body be a  disciple or a master. It is because a person is himself the cause of his  work that he is applauded when he achieved success. So the doer is  censured if he faileth. If a man were not himself the cause of his acts,  how would all this be justified? Some say that everything is the result  of providential dispensation; others again, that this is not so, but  that everything which is supposed to be the result of destiny or chance  is the result of the good or the bad acts of former lives. It is seen,  possessions are obtained from chance, as also from destiny. Something  being from destiny and something from chance, something is obtained by  exertion. In the acquisition of his objects, there is no fourth cause in  the case of man. Thus say those that are acquainted with truth and  skilled in knowledge. If, however, God himself were not the giver of  good and bad fruits, then amongst creatures there would not be any that  was miserable. If the effect of former acts be a myth, then all purposes  for which man would work should be successful. They, therefore, that  regard the three alone (mentioned above) as the doors of all success and  failure in the world, (without regarding the acts of former life), are  dull and inert like the body itself. For all this, however, a person  should act. This is the conclusion of Manu himself. The person that doth  not act, certainly succumbeth, O Yudhishthira. The man of action in this  world generally meeteth with success. The idle, however, never achieveth  success. If success becometh impossible, then should one seek to remove  the difficulties that bar his way to success. And, O king, if a person  worketh (hard), his debt (to the gods) is cancelled (whether he  achieveth success or not). The person that is idle and lieth at his  length, is overcome by adversity; while he that is active and skillful  is sure to reap success and enjoy prosperity. Intelligent persons  engaged in acts with confidence in themselves regard all who are  diffident as doubting and unsuccessful. The confident and faithful,  however, are regarded by them as successful. And this moment misery hath  overtaken us. If, however, thou betakest to action, that misery will  certainly be removed. If thou meetest failure, then that will furnish a  proof unto thee and Vrikodara and Vivatsu and the twins (that ye are  unable to snatch the kingdom from the foe). The acts of others, it is  seen, are crowned with success. It is probable that ours also will be  successful. How can one know beforehand what the consequence will be?  Having exerted thyself thou wilt know what the fruit of thy exertion  will be. The tiller tilleth with the plough the soil and soweth the  seeds thereon. He then sitteth silent, for the clouds (after that) are  the cause that would help the seeds to grow into plants. If however, the  clouds favour him not, the tiller is absolved from all blame. He sayeth  unto himself, \"What others do, I have done. If, notwithstanding this, I  meet with failure, no blame can attach to me.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#20)"],[1," head, Krishna kisses her. Radha suddenly sees who  it is and holds his hand.    On another occasion, Radha is ill from love and is lying at home on her  bed. Krishna thereupon becomes a doctor and goes from house to house  curing the sick. So successful are his cures that Radha also is tempted to  consult the new doctor and sends a maid to call him, Krishna comes but  before entering adopts a wild disguise--putting his clothes on inside out,  matting his hair with mud, and slinging a bag of roots and plants over his  shoulder. As he enters, he sits on Radha's bed, lifts her veil, gazes  intently at her face and declares that certainly she is very ill indeed.  He then takes her pulse and says, 'it is the water of love that is rotting  her heart like a poison.' Radha is elated at this diagnosis, rouses  herself and stretches her limbs. 'You have understood my trouble,' she  says. 'Now tell me what I am to do.' 'I feel somewhat diffident at  explaining my remedy,' replies the doctor, 'But if I had the time and  place, I could ease your fever and cure you utterly.' As he says this,  Radha knows that he is Krishna and this is only another of his reckless  wiles designed to bring him near her.    But it was less in the recording of new incidents than in lyrical  descriptions of Radha and Krishna, their physical charms and ecstatic  meetings, that the poets excelled.      i      Krishna is dancing in a medley of moods and poses.    His crown sways, his eye-brows move,    Displaying the arts of a clever dancer.    The swing of his waist makes his girdle sing    And the anklets jingle.    One fancies one is listening to the sweet voice of a pair of geese as      they touch each other in dalliance.    The bangles glitter and the rings and armlets shoot their rays.    When with passion he moves his arms, what grace the movements bless!    Now he dances after the gait of ladies and now in a manner of his own.    The poet's lord is the jewel of the passionate    And builds his dance in the depths of ecstasy.[62]      (Sur Das)      ii      With Krishna in their midst the cowherds come to their homes.    The calves and cows are ahead, frisking and playing as they go.    All the pipes and horns go forth, each his own notes playing.    The sound of the flute moves the cows to low as they raise a cloud of      dust.    The crown of peacocks' feathers glistens on the head like a young moon.    The cowherd boys frolic on the path and Krishna in the centre sings his      song.    Ravished by the sight, the cowgirls pour out their minds and bodies,    Gazing on Krishna, quenching their heart's desire.      (Sur Das)      iii      Radha's glances dart from side to side.    Her restless body and clothes are heavy with dust.    Her glistening smile shines again and again.    Shy, she raises her skirt to her lips.    Startled, she stirs and once again is calm,    As now she enters the ways of love.    Sometimes she gazes at her blossoming breasts    Hiding them quickly, then forgetting they are there.    Childhood and girlhood melt in one    And young and old are both forgotten.    Says Vidyapati: O Lord of life,    Do you not know the signs of youth?[63]      (Vidyapati)      iv      Each day the breasts of Radha swelled.    Her hips grew shapely, her waist more slender.    Love's secrets stole upon her eyes.    Startled her childhood sought escape.    Her plum-like breasts grew large,    Harder and crisper, aching for love.    Krishna soon saw her as she bathed    Her filmy dress still clinging to her breasts,    Her tangled tresses falling on her heart,    A golden image swathed in yak's tail plumes.    Says Vidyapati: O wonder of women,    Only a handsome man can long for her.      (Vidyapati)      v      There was a shudder in her whispering voice.    She was shy to frame her words.    What has happened tonight to lovely Radha?    Now she consents, now she is scared.    When asked for love, she closes up her eyes,    Eager to reach the ocean of desire.    He begs her for a kiss.    She turns her mouth away    And then, like a night lily, the moon seized her.    She felt his touch startling her girdle.    She knew her love treasure was being robbed.    With her dress she covered up her breasts.    The treasure was left uncovered.    Vidyapati wonders at the neglected bed.    Lovers are busy in each other's arms.      (Vidyapati)      vi      Awake, Radha, awake    Calls the parrot and its love    For how long must you sleep,    Clasped to the heart of your Dark-stone?    Listen. The dawn has come    And the red shafts of the sun    Are making us shudder.      (Vidyapati)      vii      Startled, the parrot calls.    See those young lovers are still asleep.    On a bed of tender leaves    His dark figure is lying still.    She, the fair one,    Looks like a piece of jewelled gold.    They have emptied their quivers.    All their flower-arrows are discharged,    Drowning each other in the joy of love.    O lovely Radha, awake.    Your friends are going to the temple.    Asks Govind Das:    Whose business is it    To interrupt the ways of love?      (Govind Das)    In another kind of poem, Radha and Krishna are themselves made to  speak--Krishna, for example, describing his first glimpses of Radha and  Radha struggling to evoke in words the ecstasies of their love.      viii      Like stilled lightning her fair face.    I saw her by the river,    Her hair dressed with jasmine,    Plaited like a coiled snake.    O friend, I will tell you    The secret of my heart.    With her darting glances    And gentle smiles    She made me wild with love.    Throwing and catching a ball of flowers,    She showed me to the full    Her youthful form.    Uptilted breasts    Peeped from her dress.    Her face was bright    With taunting smiles.    With anklet bells    Her feet shone red.    Says Chandi Das:    Will you see her again?      (Chandi Das)      ix      Listen, O lovely darling,    Cease your anger.    I promise by the golden pitchers of your breasts    And by your necklace-snake,    Which now I gather in my hands,    If ever I touch anyone but you    May your necklace-snake bite me;    And if my words do not ring true,    Punish me as I deserve.    Bind me in your arms, hit me with your thighs,    Choke my heart with your milk-swollen breasts,    Lock me day and night in the prison of your heart.      (Vidyapati)      x      Never have I seen such love nor heard of it.    Even the eyelids' flutter    Holds eternity.    Clasped to my breasts, you are far from me.    I would keep you as a veil close to my face.    I shudder with fright when you turn your eyes away,    As one body, we spend the night,    Sinking in the deeps of delight.    As dawn comes, we see with anxious hearts    Life desert us.    The very thought breaks my heart.    Says Chandi Das:    O sweet girl, how I understand.      (Chandi Das)      xi      O friend, I cannot tell you    Whether he was near or far, real or a dream.    Like a vine of lightning,    As I chained the dark one,    felt a river flooding in my heart.    Like a shining moon,    I devoured that liquid face.    I felt stars shooting around me.    The sky fell with my dress    Leaving my ravished breasts.    I was rocking like the earth.    In my storming breath    I could hear my ankle-bells,    Sounding like bees.    Drowned in the last-waters of dissolution    I knew that this was not the end.    Says Vidyapati:    How can I possibly believe such nonsense?      (Vidyapati)    [Footnote 60: Plate 29.]    [Footnote 61: Plate 35.]    [Footnote 62: Note 20.]    [Footnote 63: Note 20.]        (iv) The Rasika Priya      It is a third development, however, which reveals the insistent  attractions of Krishna the divine lover. From about the seventh century  onwards Indian thinkers had been fascinated by the great variety of  possible romantic experiences. Writers had classified feminine beauty and  codified the different situations which might arise in the course of a  romance. A woman, for example, would be catalogued according as she was  'one's own, another's or anyone's' and whether she was young, adolescent  or adult. Beauties with adult physiques were divided into unmarried and  married, while cutting across such divisions was yet another based on the  particular circumstances in which a woman might find herself. Such  circumstances were normally eight in number--when her husband or lover was  on the point of coming and she was ready to receive him; when she was  parted from him and was filled with longing; when he was constant and she  was thus enjoying the calm happiness of stable love; when, for the time  being, she was estranged due to some quarrel or tiff; when she had been  deceived; when she had gone to meet her lover but had waited in vain,  thereby being jilted; when her husband or lover had gone abroad and she  was faced with days of lonely waiting; and finally, when she had left the  house and gone to meet him. Ladies in situations such as these were known  as _nayikas_ and the text embodying the standard classification was the  Sanskrit treatise, the _Bharatiya Natya Sastra_. A similar analysis was  made of men--lovers or _nayakas_ being sometimes divided into fourteen  different types.    Until the fourteenth century, such writings were studies in erotics  rather than in literature--the actual situations rather than their  literary treatment being the authors' prime concern. During the fourteenth  century, however, questions of literary taste began to be discussed and  there arose a new type of Sanskrit treatise, showing how different kinds  of lover should be treated in poetry and illustrating the correct  attitudes by carefully chosen verses. In all these writings the standard  of reference was human passion. The lovers of poetry might bear only a  slight relation to lovers in real life. Many of the situations envisaged  might rarely, if ever, occur. It was sufficient that granted"]]]
