To follow thee I'm fated.  But I must say, thy plan was very bright!  We seek the Brocken here, on the Walpurgis night,  Then hold ourselves, when here, completely isolated!    _Mephistopheles_. What motley flames light up the heather!  A merry club is met together,  In a small group one's not alone.    _Faust_. I'd rather be up there, I own!  See! curling smoke and flames right blue!  To see the Evil One they travel;  There many a riddle to unravel.    _Mephistopheles_. And tie up many another, too.  Let the great world there rave and riot,  We here will house ourselves in quiet.  The saying has been long well known:  In the great world one makes a small one of his own.  I see young witches there quite naked all,  And old ones who, more prudent, cover.  For my sake some flight things look over;  The fun is great, the trouble small.  I hear them tuning instruments! Curs'd jangle!  Well! one must learn with such things not to wrangle.  Come on! Come on! For so it needs must be,  Thou shalt at once be introduced by me.  And I new thanks from thee be earning.  That is no scanty space; what sayst thou, friend?  Just take a look! thou scarce canst see the end.  There, in a row, a hundred fires are burning;  They dance, chat, cook, drink, love; where can be found  Any thing better, now, the wide world round?    _Faust_. Wilt thou, as things are now in this condition,  Present thyself for devil, or magician?    _Mephistopheles_. I've been much used, indeed, to going incognito;    But then, on gala-day, one will his order show.  No garter makes my rank appear,  But then the cloven foot stands high in honor here.  Seest thou the snail? Look there! where she comes creeping yonder!  Had she already smelt the rat,  I should not very greatly wonder.  Disguise is useless now, depend on that.  Come, then! we will from fire to fire wander,  Thou shalt the wooer be and I the pander.           [_To a party who sit round expiring embers_.]  Old gentlemen, you scarce can hear the fiddle!  You'd gain more praise from me, ensconced there in the middle,  'Mongst that young rousing, tousing set.  One can, at home, enough retirement get.    _General_. Trust not the people's fickle favor!  However much thou mayst for them have done.  Nations, as well as women, ever,  Worship the rising, not the setting sun.    _Minister_. From the right path we've drifted far away,  The good old past my heart engages;  Those were the real golden ages,  When such as we held all the sway.    _Parvenu_. We were no simpletons, I trow,  And often did the thing we should not;  But all is turning topsy-turvy now,  And if we tried to stem the wave, we could not.    _Author_. Who on the whole will read a work today,  Of moderate sense, with any pleasure?  And as regards the dear young people, they  Pert and precocious are beyond all measure.    _Mephistopheles_ [_who all at once appears very old_].  The race is ripened for the judgment day:  So I, for the last time, climb the witch-mountain, thinking,  And, as my cask runs thick, I say,  The world, too, on its lees is sinking.    _Witch-broker_. Good gentlemen, don't hurry by!  The opportunity's a rare one!  My stock is an uncommon fair one,  Please give it an attentive eye.  There's nothing in my shop, whatever,  But on the earth its mate is found;  That has not proved itself right clever  To deal mankind some fatal wound.  No dagger here, but blood has some time stained it;  No cup, that has not held some hot and poisonous juice,  And stung to death the throat that drained it;  No trinket, but did once a maid seduce;  No sword, but hath some tie of sacred honor riven,  Or haply from behind through foeman's neck been driven.    _Mephistopheles_. You're quite behind the times, I tell you, Aunty!  By-gones be by-gones! done is done!  Get us up something new and jaunty!  For new things now the people run.    _Faust_. To keep my wits I must endeavor!  Call this a fair! I swear, I never--!    _Mephistopheles_. Upward the billowy mass is moving;  You're shoved along and think, meanwhile, you're shoving.    _Faust_. What woman's that?    _Mephistopheles_. Mark her attentively.  That's Lilith.[37]    _Faust_. Who?    _Mephistopbeles_. Adam's first wife is she.  Beware of her one charm, those lovely tresses,  In which she shines preeminently fair.  When those soft meshes once a young man snare,  How hard 'twill be to escape he little guesses.    _Faust_. There sit an old one and a young together;  They've skipped it well along the heather!    _Mephistopheles_. No rest from that till night is through.  Another dance is up; come on! let us fall to.    _Faust_ [_dancing with the young one_]. A lovely dream once came to me;  In it I saw an apple-tree;  Two beauteous apples beckoned there,  I climbed to pluck the fruit so fair.    _The Fair one_. Apples you greatly seem to prize,  And did so even in Paradise.  I feel myself delighted much  That in my garden I have such.    _Mephistopheles_ [_with the old hag_]. A dismal dream once came to me;  In it I saw a cloven tree,  It had a ------ but still,  I looked on it with right good-will.    _The Hog_. With best respect I here salute  The noble knight of the cloven foot!  Let him hold a ------ near,  If a ------ he does not fear.    _Proctophantasmist_.[38] What's this ye undertake? Confounded crew!  Have we not giv'n you demonstration?  No spirit stands on legs in all creation,  And here you dance just as we mortals do!    _The Fair one_ [_dancing_]. What does that fellow at our ball?    _Faust_ [_dancing_]. Eh! he must have a hand in all.  What others dance that he appraises.  Unless each step he criticizes,  The step as good as no step he will call.  But when we move ahead, that plagues him more than all.  If in a circle you would still keep turning,  As he himself in his old mill goes round,  He would be sure to call that sound!  And most so, if you went by his superior learning.    _Proctophantasmist_. What, and you still are here! Unheard off obstinates!  Begone! We've cleared it up! You shallow pates!  The devilish pack from rules deliverance boasts.  We've grown so wise, and Tegel[39] still sees ghosts.  How long I've toiled to sweep these cobwebs from the brain,  And yet--unheard of folly! all in vain.    _The Fair one_. And yet on us the stupid bore still tries it!    _Proctophantasmist_. I tell you spirits, to the face,  I give to spirit-tyranny no place,  My spirit cannot exercise it.               [_They dance on_.]  I can't succeed to-day, I know it;  Still, there's the journey, which I like to make,  And hope, before the final step I take,  To rid the world of devil and of poet.    _Mephistopheles_. You'll see him shortly sit into a puddle,  In that way his heart is reassured;  When on his rump the leeches well shall fuddle,  Of spirits and of spirit he'll be cured.              [_To_ FAUST, _who has left the dance_.]  Why let the lovely girl slip through thy fingers,  Who to thy dance so sweetly sang?    _Faust_. Ah, right amidst her singing, sprang  A wee red mouse from her mouth and made me cower.    _Mephistopheles_. That's nothing wrong! You're in a dainty way;  Enough, the mouse at least wan't gray.  Who minds such thing in happy amorous hour?    _Faust_. Then saw I--    _Mephistopheles_. What?    _Faust_. Mephisto, seest thou not  Yon pale, fair child afar, who stands so sad and lonely,  And moves so slowly from the spot,  Her feet seem locked, and she drags them only.  I must confess, she seems to me  To look like my own good Margery.    _Mephistopheles_. Leave that alone! The sight no health can bring.  it is a magic shape, an idol, no live thing.  To meet it never can be good!  Its haggard look congeals a mortal's blood,  And almost turns him into stone;  The story of Medusa thou hast known.    _Faust_. Yes, 'tis a dead one's eyes that stare upon me,  Eyes that no loving hand e'er closed;  That is the angel form of her who won me,  Tis the dear breast on which I once reposed.    _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis sorcery all, thou fool, misled by passion's dreams!  For she to every one his own love seems.    _Faust_. What bliss! what woe!  Methinks I never  My sight from that sweet form can sever.  Seeft thou, not thicker than a knife-blade's back,  A small red ribbon, fitting sweetly  The lovely neck it clasps so neatly?    _Mephistopheles_. I see the streak around her neck.  Her head beneath her arm, you'll next behold her;  Perseus has lopped it from her shoulder,--  But let thy crazy passion rest!  Come, climb with me yon hillock's breast,  Was e'er the Prater[40] merrier then?  And if no sorcerer's charm is o'er me,  That is a theatre before me.  What's doing there?    _Servibilis_. They'll straight begin again.  A bran-new piece, the very last of seven;  To have so much, the fashion here thinks fit.  By Dilettantes it is given;  'Twas by a Dilettante writ.  Excuse me, sirs, I go to greet you;  I am the curtain-raising Dilettant.    _Mephistopheles_. When I upon the Blocksberg meet you,  That I approve; for there's your place, I grant.               WALPURGIS-NIGHT'S DREAM, OR OBERON AND TITANIA'S GOLDEN NUPTIALS.         _Intermezzo_.      _Theatre manager_. Here, for once, we rest, to-day,  Heirs of Mieding's[41] glory.  All the scenery we display--  Damp vale and mountain hoary!    _Herald_. To make the wedding a golden one,  Must fifty years expire;  But when once the strife is done,  I prize the _gold_ the higher.    _Oberon_. Spirits, if my good ye mean,  Now let all wrongs be righted;  For to-day your king and queen  Are once again united.    _Puck_. Once let Puck coming whirling round,  And set his foot to whisking,  Hundreds with him throng the ground,  Frolicking and frisking.    _Ariel_. Ariel awakes the song  With many a heavenly measure;  Fools not few he draws along,  But fair ones hear with pleasure.    _Oberon_.

The Icelanders abandoned Odin, Freya, Thor, and their whole  pagan mythology, in consideration of a single disputation between the  heathen priests and the Christian missionaries. The priests threatened  the island with a desolating eruption of the volcano called Hecla, as  the necessary consequence of the vengeance of their deities. Snorro, the  same who advised the inquest against the ghosts, had become a convert to  the Christian religion, and was present on the occasion, and as the  conference was held on the surface of what had been a stream of lava,  now covered with vegetable substances, he answered the priests with much  readiness, \"To what was the indignation of the gods owing when the  substance on which we stand was fluid and scorching? Believe me, men of  Iceland, the eruption of the volcano depends on natural circumstances  now as it did then, and is not the engine of vengeance intrusted to Thor  and Odin.\" It is evident that men who reasoned with so much accuracy  concerning the imbecility of Odin and Thor were well prepared, on  abandoning their worship, to consider their former deities, of whom they  believed so much that was impious, in the light of evil demons.    But there were some particulars of the Northern creed in which it  corresponded so exactly with that of the classics as leaves room to  doubt whether the original Asae, or Asiatics, the founders of the  Scandinavian system, had, before their migration from Asia, derived them  from some common source with those of the Greeks and Romans; or whether,  on the other hand, the same proneness of the human mind to superstition  has caused that similar ideas are adopted in different regions, as the  same plants are found in distant countries without the one, as far as  can be discovered, having obtained the seed from the others.    The classical fiction, for example, of the satyrs and other subordinate  deities of wood and wild, whose power is rather delusive than  formidable, and whose supernatural pranks intimate rather a wish to  inflict terror than to do hurt, was received among the Northern people,  and perhaps transferred by them to the Celtic tribes. It is an idea  which seems common to many nations. The existence of a satyr, in the  silvan form, is even pretended to be proved by the evidence of Saint  Anthony, to whom one is said to have appeared in the desert. The  Scottish Gael have an idea of the same kind, respecting a goblin called  _Ourisk_, whose form is like that of Pan, and his attendants something  between a man and a goat, the nether extremities being in the latter  form. A species of cavern, or rather hole, in the rock, affords to the  wildest retreat in the romantic neighbourhood of Loch Katrine a name  taken from classical superstition. It is not the least curious  circumstance that from this silvan deity the modern nations of Europe  have borrowed the degrading and unsuitable emblems of the goat's visage  and form, the horns, hoofs, and tail, with which they have depicted the  author of evil when it pleased him to show himself on earth. So that the  alteration of a single word would render Pope's well-known line more  truly adapted to the fact, should we venture to read--    \"And Pan to _Satan_ lends his heathen horn.\"    We cannot attribute the transferrence of the attributes of the Northern  satyr, or Celtic ourisk, to the arch-fiend, to any particular  resemblance between the character of these deities and that of Satan. On  the contrary, the ourisk of the Celts was a creature by no means  peculiarly malevolent or formidably powerful, but rather a melancholy  spirit, which dwelt in wildernesses far removed from men. If we are to  identify him with the Brown Dwarf of the Border moors, the ourisk has a  mortal term of life and a hope of salvation, as indeed the same high  claim was made by the satyr who appeared to St. Anthony. Moreover, the  Highland ourisk was a species of lubber fiend, and capable of being  over-reached by those who understood philology. It is related of one of  these goblins which frequented a mill near the foot of Loch Lomond, that  the miller, desiring to get rid of this meddling spirit, who injured the  machinery by setting the water on the wheel when there was no grain to  be grinded, contrived to have a meeting with the goblin by watching in  his mill till night. The ourisk then entered, and demanded the miller's  name, and was informed that he was called _Myself_; on which is founded  a story almost exactly like that of OUTIS in the \"Odyssey,\" a tale  which, though classic, is by no means an elegant or ingenious fiction,  but which we are astonished to find in an obscure district, and in the  Celtic tongue, seeming to argue some connexion or communication between  these remote Highlands of Scotland and the readers of Homer in former  days, which we cannot account for. After all, perhaps, some Churchman  more learned than his brethren may have transferred the legend from  Sicily to Duncrune, from the shores of the Mediterranean to those of  Loch Lomond. I have heard it also told that the celebrated freebooter,  Rob Roy, once gained a victory by disguising a part of his men with  goat-skins, so as to resemble the _ourisk_ or Highland satyr.    There was an individual satyr called, I think, Meming, belonging to the  Scandinavian mythology, of a character different from the ourisk, though  similar in shape, whom it was the boast of the highest champions to seek  out in the solitudes which he inhabited. He was an armourer of extreme  dexterity, and the weapons which he forged were of the highest value.  But as club-law pervaded the ancient system of Scandinavia, Meming had  the humour of refusing to work for any customer save such as compelled  him to it with force of arms. He may be, perhaps, identified with the  recusant smith who fled before Fingal from Ireland to the Orkneys, and  being there overtaken, was compelled to forge the sword which Fingal  afterwards wore in all his battles, and which was called the Son of the  dark brown Luno, from the name of the armourer who forged it.[21]    [Footnote 21: The weapon is often mentioned in Mr. MacPherson's  paraphrases; but the Irish ballad, which gives a spirited account of the  debate between the champion and the armourer, is nowhere introduced.]    From this it will appear that there were originals enough in the  mythology of the Goths, as well as Celts, to furnish the modern  attributes ascribed to Satan in later times, when the object of painter  or poet was to display him in his true form and with all his terrors.  Even the genius of Guido and of Tasso have been unable to surmount this  prejudice, the more rooted, perhaps, that the wicked are described as  goats in Scripture, and that the devil is called the old dragon. In  Raffael's famous painting of the archangel Michael binding Satan, the  dignity, power, and angelic character expressed by the seraph form an  extraordinary contrast to the poor conception of a being who ought not,  even in that lowest degradation, to have seemed so unworthy an  antagonist. Neither has Tasso been more happy, where he represents the  divan of darkness in the enchanted forest as presided over by a monarch  having a huge tail, hoofs, and all the usual accompaniments of popular  diablerie. The genius of Milton alone could discard all these vulgar  puerilities, and assign to the author of evil the terrible dignity of  one who should seem not \"less than archangel ruined.\" This species of  degradation is yet grosser when we take into consideration the changes  which popular opinions have wrought respecting the taste, habits,  powers, modes of tempting, and habits of tormenting, which are such as  might rather be ascribed to some stupid superannuated and doting ogre of  a fairy tale, than to the powerful-minded demon who fell through pride  and rebellion, not through folly or incapacity.    Having, however, adopted our present ideas of the devil as they are  expressed by his nearest acquaintances, the witches, from the accounts  of satyrs, which seem to have been articles of faith both among the  Celtic and Gothic tribes, we must next notice another fruitful fountain  of demonological fancies. But as this source of the mythology of the  Middle Ages must necessarily comprehend some account of the fairy folk,  to whom much of it must be referred, it is necessary to make a pause  before we enter upon the mystic and marvellous connexion supposed to  exist between the impenitent kingdom of Satan and those merry dancers by  moonlight.          LETTER IV.        The Fairy Superstition is derived from different sources--The      Classical Worship of the Silvans, or Rural Deities, proved by Roman      Altars discovered--The Gothic Duergar, or Dwarfs--Supposed to be      derived from the Northern Laps, or Fins--\"The      Niebelungen-Lied\"--King Laurin's Adventure--Celtic Fairies of a      gayer character, yet their pleasures empty and illusory--Addicted to      carry off Human Beings, both Infants and Adults--Adventures of a      Butler in Ireland--The Elves supposed to pay a Tax to Hell--The      Irish, Welsh, Highlanders, and Manxmen held the same belief--It was      rather rendered more gloomy by the Northern Traditions--Merlin and      Arthur carried off by the Fairies--Also Thomas of Erceldoune--His      Amour with the Queen of Elfland--His re-appearance in latter      times--Another account from Reginald Scot--Conjectures on the      derivation of the word Fairy.      We may premise by observing, that the classics had not forgotten to  enrol in their mythology a certain species of subordinate deities,  resembling the modern elves in their habits.
