There's been no rain.\"    August spurred his roan after Dave, and Hare kept close behind them,  till they reined in on a muddy bank. What had once been a waterhole was  a red and yellow heap of shale, fragments of stones, gravel, and sand.  There was no water, and the sheep were bleating. August dismounted and  climbed high above the hole to examine the slope; soon he strode down  with giant steps, his huge fists clinched, shaking his gray mane like a  lion.    \"I've found the tracks! Somebody climbed up and rolled the stones,  started the cave-in. Who?\"    \"Holderness's men. They did the same for Martin Cole's waterhole at  Rocky Point. How old are the tracks?\"    \"Two days, perhaps. We can't follow them. What can be done?\"    \"Some of Holderness's men are Mormons, and others are square fellows.  They wouldn't stand for such work as this, and somebody ought to ride in  there and tell them.\"    \"And get shot up by the men paid to do the dirty work. No. I won't hear  of it. This amounts to nothing; we seldom use this hole, only twice a  year when driving the flock. But it makes me fear for Silver Cup and  Seeping Springs.\"    \"It makes me fear for the sheep, if this wind doesn't change.\"    \"Ah! I had forgotten the river scent. It's not strong to-night. We might  venture if it wasn't for the strip of sand. We'll camp here and start  the drive at dawn.\"    The sun went down under a crimson veil; a dull glow spread, fan-shaped,  upward; twilight faded to darkness with the going down of the wind.  August Naab paced to and fro before his tired and thirsty flock.    \"I'd like to know,\" said Hare to Dave, \"why those men filled up this  waterhole.\"    \"Holderness wants to cut us off from Silver Cup Spring, and this was a  half-way waterhole. Probably he didn't know we had the sheep upland, but  he wouldn't have cared. He's set himself to get our cattle range and  he'll stop at nothing. Prospects look black for us. Father never gives  up. He doesn't believe yet that we can lose our water. He prays and  hopes, and sees good and mercy in his worst enemies.\"    \"If Holderness works as far as Silver Cup, how will he go to work to  steal another man's range and water?\"    \"He'll throw up a cabin, send in his men, drive in ten thousand steers.\"    \"Well, will his men try to keep you away from your own water, or your  cattle?\"    \"Not openly. They'll pretend to welcome us, and drive our cattle away in  our absence. You see there are only five of us to ride the ranges, and  we'd need five times five to watch all the stock.\"    \"Then you can't stop this outrage?\"    \"There's only one way,\" said Dave, significantly tapping the black  handle of his Colt. \"Holderness thinks he pulls the wool over our eyes  by talking of the cattle company that employs him. He's the company  himself, and he's hand and glove with Dene.\"    \"And I suppose, if your father and you boys were to ride over to  Holderness's newest stand, and tell him to get off there would be a  fight.\"    \"We'd never reach him now, that is, if we went together. One of us alone  might get to see him, especially in White Sage. If we all rode over to  his ranch we'd have to fight his men before we reached the corrals. You  yourself will find it pretty warm when you go out with us on the ranges,  and if you make White Sage you'll find it hot. You're called 'Dene's  spy' there, and the rustlers are still looking for you. I wouldn't worry  about it, though.\"    \"Why not, I'd like to know?\" inquired Hare, with a short laugh.    \"Well, if you're like the other Gentiles who have come into Utah you  won't have scruples about drawing on a man. Father says the draw comes  natural to you, and you're as quick as he is. Then he says you can beat  any rifle shot he ever saw, and that long-barrelled gun you've got will  shoot a mile. So if it comes to shooting--why, you can shoot. If you  want to run--who's going to catch you on that white-maned stallion? We  talked about you, George and I; we're mighty glad you're well and can  ride with us.\"    Long into the night Jack Hare thought over this talk. It opened up a  vista of the range-life into which he was soon to enter. He tried to  silence the voice within that cried out, eager and reckless, for the  long rides on the windy open. The years of his illness returned in  fancy, the narrow room with the lamp and the book, and the tears over  stories and dreams of adventure never to be for such as he. And now how  wonderful was life! It was, after all, to be full for him. It was  already full. Already he slept on the ground, open to the sky. He looked  up at a wild black cliff, mountain-high, with its windworn star of blue;  he felt himself on the threshold of the desert, with that subtle mystery  waiting; he knew himself to be close to strenuous action on the ranges,  companion of these sombre Mormons, exposed to their peril, making their  cause his cause, their life his life. What of their friendship, their  confidence? Was he worthy? Would he fail at the pinch? What a man he  must become to approach their simple estimate of him! Because he had  found health and strength, because he could shoot, because he had the  fleetest horse on the desert, were these reasons for their friendship?  No, these were only reasons for their trust. August Naab loved him.  Mescal loved him; Dave and George made of him a brother. \"They shall  have my life,\" he muttered.    The bleating of the sheep heralded another day. With the brightening  light began the drive over the sand. Under the cliff the shade was cool  and fresh; there was no wind; the sheep made good progress. But the  broken line of shade crept inward toward the flock, and passed it. The  sun beat down, and the wind arose. A red haze of fine sand eddied about  the toiling sheep and shepherds. Piute trudged ahead leading the king-  ram, old Socker, the leader of the flock; Mescal and Hare rode at the  right, turning their faces from the sand-filled puffs of wind; August  and Dave drove behind; Wolf, as always, took care of the stragglers. An  hour went by without signs of distress; and with half the five-mile trip  at his back August Naab's voice gathered cheer. The sun beat hotter.  Another hour told a different story--the sheep labored; they had to be  forced by urge of whip, by knees of horses, by Wolf's threatening bark.  They stopped altogether during the frequent hot sand-blasts, and could  not be driven. So time dragged. The flock straggled out to a long  irregular line; rams refused to budge till they were ready; sheep lay  down to rest; lambs fell. But there was an end to the belt of sand, and  August Naab at last drove the lagging trailers out upon the stony bench.    The sun was about two hours past the meridian; the red walls of the  desert were closing in; the V-shaped split where the Colorado cut  through was in sight. The trail now was wide and unobstructed and the  distance short, yet August Naab ever and anon turned to face the canyon  and shook his head in anxious foreboding.    It quickly dawned upon Hare that the sheep were behaving in a way new  and singular to him. They packed densely now, crowding forward, many  raising their heads over the haunches of others and bleating. They were  not in their usual calm pattering hurry, but nervous, excited, and  continually facing west toward the canyon, noses up.    On the top of the next little ridge Hare heard Silvermane snort as he  did when led to drink. There was a scent of water on the wind. Hare  caught it, a damp, muggy smell. The sheep had noticed it long before,  and now under its nearer, stronger influence began to bleat wildly, to  run faster, to crowd without aim.    \"There's work ahead. Keep them packed and going. Turn the wheelers,\"  ordered August.    What had been a drive became a flight. And it was well so long as the  sheep headed straight up the trail. Piute had to go to the right to  avoid being run down. Mescal rode up to fill his place. Hare took his  cue from Dave, and rode along the flank, crowding the sheep inward.  August cracked his whip behind. For half a mile the flock kept to the  trail, then, as if by common consent, they sheered off to the right.  With this move August and Dave were transformed from quiet almost to  frenzy. They galloped to the fore, and into the very faces of the  turning sheep, and drove them back. Then the rear-guard of the flock  curved outward.    \"Drive them in!\" roared August.    Hare sent Silvermane at the deflecting sheep and frightened them into  line.    Wolf no longer had power to chase the stragglers; they had to be turned  by a horse. All along the flank noses pointed outward; here and there  sheep wilder than the others leaped forward to lead a widening wave of  bobbing woolly backs. Mescal engaged one point, Hare another, Dave  another, and August Naab's roan thundered up and down the constantly  broken line. All this while as the shepherds fought back the sheep, the  flight continued faster eastward, farther canyonward. Each side gained,  but the flock gained more toward the canyon than the drivers gained  toward the oasis.    By August's hoarse yells, by Dave's stern face and ceaseless swift  action, by the increasing din, Hare knew terrible danger hung over the  flock; what it was he could not tell. He heard the roar of the river  rapids, and it seemed that the sheep heard it with him. They plunged  madly; they had gone wild from the scent and sound of water. Their eyes  gleamed red; their tongues flew out. There was no aim to the rush of the  great body of sheep, but they followed the leaders and the leaders  followed the scent. And the drivers headed them off, rode them down,  ceaselessly, riding forward to check one outbreak, wheeling backward to  check another.    The flight became a rout. Hare was in the thick of dust and din, of the  terror-stricken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#20)"],[1,"we  are seeking; another indication of its validity lies in the fact that  one of the characteristics of water is its power of reflecting; that  moonlight is reflected sunlight. If gold is the mind, silver is the  body, in which the mind is imaged, objectified; if gold is flamelike  love, silver is brooding affection; and in the highest regions of  consciousness, beauty is the feminine or form side of truth--its  silver mirror.    There are two forces in the world, one of projection, the other  of recall; two states, activity and rest. Nature, with tireless  ingenuity, everywhere publishes this fact: in bursting bud and falling  seed, in the updrawn waters and the descending rain; throw a stone  into the air, and when the impulse is exhausted, gravity brings it to  earth again. In civilized society these centrifugal and centripetal  forces find expression in the anarchic and radical spirit which breaks  down and re-forms existing institutions, and in the conservative  spirit which preserves and upbuilds by gradual accretion; they are  analogous to igneous and to aqueous action in the formation and  upbuilding of the earth itself, and find their prototype again in man  and woman: man, the warrior, who prevails by the active exercise  of his powers, and woman, \"the treasury of the continued race,\"  who conquers by continual quietness. Man and woman symbolize forces  centrifugal and centripetal not alone in their inner nature, and  in the social and economic functions peculiar to each, but in their  physical aspects and peculiarities as well, for man is small of flank  and broad of shoulder, with relatively large extremities, _i.e.,  centrifugal_: while woman is formed with broad hips, narrow shoulders,  and small feet and hands, _i.e., centripetal_. Woman's instinctive  and unconscious gestures are _towards_ herself, man's are _away from_  himself. The physiologist might hold that the anatomical differences  between the sexes result from their difference in function in the  reproduction and conservation of the race, and this is a true view,  but the lesser truth need not necessarily exclude the greater. As  Chesterton says, \"Something in the evil spirit of our time forces  people always to pretend to have found some material and mechanical  explanation.\" Such would have us believe, with Schopenhauer and  Bernard Shaw, that the lover's delight in the beauty of his mistress  dwells solely in his instinctive perception of her fitness to be the  mother of his child. This is undoubtedly a factor in the glamour  woman casts on man, but there are other factors too, higher as well as  lower, corresponding to different departments of our manifold nature.  First of all, there is mere physical attraction: to the man physical,  woman is a cup of delight; next, there is emotional love, whereby  woman appeals through her need of protection, her power of tenderness;  on the mental plane she is man's intellectual companion, his masculine  reason would supplement itself with her feminine intuition; he  recognizes in her an objectification, in some sort, of his own soul,  his spirit's bride, predestined throughout the ages; while the god  within him perceives her to be that portion of himself which he put  forth before the world was, to be the mother, not alone of human  children, but of all those myriad forms, within which entering, \"as in  a sheath, a knife,\" he becomes the Enjoyer, and realizes, vividly and  concretely, his bliss, his wisdom, and his power.    Adam and Eve, and the tree in the midst of the garden! After man and  woman, a tree is perhaps the most significant symbol in the  world: every tree is the Tree of Life in the sense that it is a  representation of universal becoming. To say that all things have for  their mother _prakriti_, undifferentiated substance, and for their  father _purusha_, the creative fire, is vague and metaphysical, and  conveys little meaning to our image-bred, image-fed minds; on the  physical plane we can only learn these transcendental truths by means  of symbols, and so to each of us is given a human father and a human  mother from whose relation to one another and to oneself may be  learned our relation to nature, the universal mother, and to that  immortal spirit which is the father of us all. We are given, moreover,  the symbol of the tree, which, rooted in the earth, its mother, and  nourished by her juices, strives ever upward towards its father, the  sun. The mathematician may be able to demonstrate, as a result of a  lifetime of hard thinking, that unity and infinity are but two aspects  of one thing; this is not clear to ordinary minds, but made concrete  in the tree--unity in the trunk, infinity in the foliage--any one  is able to understand it. We perceive that all things grow as a tree  grows, from unity to multiplicity, from simplicity and strength to  beauty and fineness. The generation of the line from the point, the  plane from the line, and from the plane, the solid, is a matter,  again, which chiefly interests the geometrician, but the inevitable  sequence stands revealed in seed, stem, leaf, and fruit: a point, a  line, a surface, and a sphere. There is another order of truths, also,  which a tree teaches: the renewal of its life each year is a symbol  of the reincarnation of the soul, teaching that life is never-ending  climax, and that what appears to be cessation is merely a change  of state. A tree grows great by being firmly rooted; we too, though  children of the air, need the earth, and grow by good deeds, hidden,  like the roots of the tree, out of sight; for the tree, rain and  sunshine: for the soul, tears and laughter thrill the imprisoned  spirit into conscious life.    We love and understand the trees because we have ourselves passed  through their evolution, and they survive in us still, for the  arterial and nervous systems are trees, the roots of one in the heart,  of the other in the brain. Has not our body its trunk, bearing aloft  the head, like a flower: a cup to hold the precious juices of the  brain? Has not that trunk its tapering limbs which ramify into hands  and feet, and these into fingers and toes, after the manner of the  twigs and branches of a tree?    Closely related to symbolism is sacramentalism; the man who sees  nature as a book of symbols is likely to regard life as a sacrament.  Because this is a point of view vitalizing to art let us glance at  the sacramental life, divorced from the forms and observances of any  specific religion.    This life consists in the habitual perception of an ulterior meaning,  a hidden beauty and significance in the objects, acts, and events  of every day. Though binding us to a sensuous existence, these  nevertheless contain within themselves the power of emancipating us  from it: over and above their immediate use, their pleasure or their  profit, they have a hidden meaning which contains some healing message  for the soul.    A classic example of a sacrament, not alone in the ordinary meaning  of the term, but in the special sense above defined, is the Holy  Communion of the Christian Church. Its origin is a matter of common  knowledge. On the evening of the night in which He was betrayed,  Jesus and His disciples were gathered together for the feast of the  Passover. Aware of His impending betrayal, and desirous of impressing  powerfully upon His chosen followers the nature and purpose of His  sacrifice, Jesus ordained a sacrament out of the simple materials of  the repast. He took bread and broke it, and gave to each a piece as  the symbol of His broken body; and to each He passed a cup of wine,  as a symbol of His poured-out blood. In this act, as in the washing of  the disciples' feet on the same occasion, He made His ministrations to  the needs of men's bodies an allegory of His greater ministration to  the needs of their souls.    The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is of such beauty and power that it  has persisted even to the present day. It lacks, however, the element  of universality--at least by other than Christians its universality  would be denied. Let us seek, therefore some all-embracing symbol to  illustrate the sacramental view of life.    Perhaps marriage is such a symbol. The public avowal of love between  a man and woman, their mutual assumption of the attendant privileges,  duties and responsibilities are matters so pregnant with consequences  to them and to the race that by all right-thinking people marriage is  regarded as a high and holy thing; its sacramental character is felt  and acknowledged even by those who would be puzzled to tell the reason  why.    The reason is involved in the answer to the question, \"Of what is  marriage a symbol?\" The most obvious answer, and doubtless the best  one, is found in the well known and much abused doctrine, common to  every religion, of the spiritual marriage between God and the soul.  What Christians call _the Mystic Way,_ and Buddhists _the Path_  comprises those changes in consciousness through which every soul  passes on its way to perfection. When the personal life is conceived  of as an allegory of this inner, intense, super-mundane life, it  assumes a sacramental character. With strange unanimity, followers  of the Mystic Way have given the name of marriage to that memorable  experience in \"the flight of the Alone to the Alone,\" when the soul,  after trials and purgations, enters into indissoluble union with the  spirit, that divine, creative principle whereby it is made fruitful  for this world. Marriage, then, however dear and close the union, is  the symbol of a union dearer and closer, for it is the fair prophecy  that on some higher arc of the evolutionary spiral, the soul will meet  its immortal lover and be initiated into divine mysteries.    As an example of the power of symbols to induce those changes of  consciousness whereby the soul is prepared for this union, it is  recorded that an eminent scientist was"]]]
