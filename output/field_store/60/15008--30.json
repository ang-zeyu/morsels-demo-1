PAULOWNIA IMPERIALIS.--Japan, 1840. This is a handsome, fast-growing  tree, and one that is particularly valuable for its ample foliage, and  distinct and showy flowers. Though perfectly hardy, in other respects it  is unfortunate that the season at which the Paulownia flowers is so  early that, unless the conditions are unusually favourable, the flower  buds get destroyed by the frost. The tree grows to fully 40 feet high in  this country, and is a grandly decorative object in its foliage alone,  and for which, should the flowers never be produced, it is well worthy  of cultivation. They are ovate-cordate, thickly covered with a grayish  woolly tomentum, and often measure, but particularly in young and  healthy trees, as much as 10 inches in length. The Foxglove-like flowers  are purplish-violet and spotted, and borne in terminal panicles. They  are sweetly-scented. When favourably situated, and in cool, sandy loam  or peaty earth, the growth of the tree is very rapid, and when a tree  has been cut over, the shoots sent out often exceed 6 feet in length in  one season, and nearly 2 inches in diameter. There are many fine old  trees throughout the country, and which testify to the general hardihood  of the Paulownia.      PERIPLOCA.    PERIPLOCA GRAECA.--Poison Vine. South Eastern Europe, and Orient, 1597.  A tall, climbing shrub, with small, ovate-lanceolate leaves, and  clusters of curious purplish-brown, green-tipped flowers produced in  summer. The long, incurved appendages, in the shape of a crown, and  placed so as to protect the style and anthers, render the flowers of  peculiar interest. Though often used as a greenhouse plant, it is  perfectly hardy, and makes a neat, deciduous wall or arch covering,  thriving to perfection in rich soil that is well-drained. It is readily  propagated from cuttings.      PERNETTYA.    PERNETTYA MUCRONATA (_syn Arbutus mucronata_).--Prickly Heath. Magellan,  1828. This is a dwarf-growing, wiry shrub, with narrow, stiff leaves,  and bears an abundance of white, bell-shaped flowers. It is a capital  wind screen, and may be used to advantage on the exposed side of  rockwork or flower beds, or as an ornamental shrub by the pond or lake  side. The small dark-green leaves, the tiny white flowers, and great  abundance of deep purple berries in winter, are all points that are in  favour of the shrub for extended cultivation. The pretty, pinky shoots,  too, help to make the plant attractive even in mid-winter. Propagation  by layers or seed is readily brought about. To grow this shrub to  perfection, peaty soil or decayed vegetable matter will be found most  suitable. There is a narrow-leaved form named P. mucronata angustifolia,  and another on which the name of P. mucronata speciosa has been  bestowed.    There are many beautiful-berried forms of the Pernettya, but as their  flowers are small can hardly be included in our list.      PHILADELPHUS.    PHILADELPHUS CORONARIUS.--Mock Orange, or Syringa. South Europe, 1596. A  well-known and valuable garden shrub, of from 6 feet to 10 feet high,  with ovate and serrulated leaves, and pretty racemes of white or  yellowish-white, fragrant flowers. P. coronarius aureo-variegatus is one  of the numerous forms of this shrub, having brightly-tinted, golden  foliage, but the flowers are in no way superior to those of the parent.  It is, if only for the foliage, an extremely pretty and distinct  variety. P. coronarius argenteo-variegatus has silvery-tinted leaves; P.  coronarius flore-pleno, full double flowers; and P. coronarius Keteleeri  flore-pleno is the best double-flowered form in cultivation.    P. GORDONIANUS, an American species (1839), is a well-known and  beautiful shrub, in which the flowers are usually double the size of  those of the common species, and which are not produced till July, while  those of P. coronarius appear in early May.    P. GRANDIFLORUS (_syns P. floribundus, P. latifolius_ and _P.  speciosus_).--Southern United States, 1811. This has rotundate,  irregularly-toothed leaves, and large white, sweetly-scented flowers  produced in clusters. This forms a stout bush 10 feet high, and as much  through. There are two varieties, P. grandiflorus laxus, and P.  grandiflorus speciosissimus, both distinct and pretty kinds.    P. HIRSUTUS.--North America, 1820. Another handsome, small-flowered  species, of dwarf growth, and having hairy leaves.    P. INODOROUS, also from North America (1738), differs little in size  and shape of flowers from P. grandiflorus, but the flowers are without  scent. The leaves, too, are quite glabrous and obscurely toothed.    P. LEMOINEI BOULE D'ARGENT is a cross, raised in 1888, from P. Lemoinei  and the double-flowered form of P. coronarius. The flowers are double  white and with the pleasant, but not heavy, scent of P. microphyllus. P.  Lemoinei Gerbe de Neige bears pleasantly-scented flowers that are as  large as those of the well-known P. speciosissimus. There is an erect  form of P. Lemoinei named erectus that is also worthy of note.    P. LEWISI, from North America, is hardly sufficiently distinct from some  of the others to warrant special notice.    P. MICROPHYLLUS, from New Mexico (1883), is of low growth, and  remarkable for its slender branches, small, Myrtle-like leaves, and  abundance of small, white flowers. It is a decidedly pretty shrub, but  is not so hardy as the others.    P. SATZUMI (_syn P. chinensis_).--Japan, 1851. A slender-growing  species, with long and narrow leaves, and large, white flowers.    P. TRIFLORUS and P. MEXICANUS are other species that might be worthy of  including in a representative collection of these plants.    This is a valuable genus of shrubs, all being remarkable for the  abundance of white, and usually sweet-scented, flowers which they  produce. They require no special treatment, few soils, if at all free  and rich, coming amiss to them; while even as shrubs for shady  situations they are not to be despised. Propagation is effected by means  of cuttings, which root freely if placed in sandy soil.      PHILLYREA.    P. ANGUSTIFOLIA (narrow-leaved Phillyrea), P. ilicifolia (Holly-leaved  Phillyrea), P. salicifolia (Willow-leaved Phillyrea), P. buxifolia  (Box-leaved Phillyrea), and P. ligustrifolia (Privet-leaved Phillyrea),  are all more or less valuable species, and their names indicate their  peculiarities of leafage. P. angustifolia rosmarinifolia (_syn P.  neapolitana_) is a somewhat rare shrub, but one that is well worthy of  culture, if only for its neat habit and tiny little Rosemary-like  leaves. It is from Italy, and known under the synonym of _P.  rosmarinifolia_.    P. LATIFOLIA (_syn P. obliqua_).--Broad-leaved Phillyrea. South Europe,  1597. This is a compact-growing and exceedingly ornamental shrub, with  bright and shining, ovate-serrulated leaves. For its handsome, evergreen  foliage and compact habit of growth it is, perhaps, most to be valued,  for the small flowers are at their best both dull and inconspicuous. Not  very hardy unless in the sea-coast garden.    P. MEDIA (_syns P. ligustrifolia_ and _P. oleaefolia_).--South Europe,  1597. This is another interesting species, but not at all common in  cultivation.    P. VILMORINIANA (_syns P. laurifolia_ and _P. decora_).--Asia Minor,  1885, This is a grand addition to these valuable shrubs, of which it is  decidedly the best from an ornamental point of view. It is of compact  growth, with large, Laurel-like leaves, which are of a pleasing shade of  green, and fully 4 inches long. They are of stout, leathery texture, and  plentifully produced. That this shrub is perfectly hardy is now a  well-established fact.    The Phillyreas succeed well in light, warm, but not too dry soil, and  they do all the better if a warm and sheltered position is assigned to  them. Being unusually bright of foliage, they are of great service in  planting for shrubbery embellishment, and which they light up in a very  conspicuous manner during the dull winter months. They get shabby and  meagre foliaged if exposed to cold winds.      PHLOMIS.    PHLOMIS FRUTICOSA.--Jerusalem Sage. Mediterranean region, 1596. This is  a neat-growing shrubby plant, with ovate acute leaves, that are covered  with a yellowish down. From the axils of the upper leaves the whorls of  yellow flowers are freely produced during the summer months. It is  valued for its neat growth, and as growing on dry soils where few other  plants could eke out an existence.      PHOTINIA.    PHOTINIA JAPONICA (_syn Eriobotrya japonica_).--Loquat, Japan Medlar, or  Japan Quince. Japan, 1787. This is chiefly remarkable for its handsome  foliage, the leaves being oblong of shape and downy on the under sides.  The white flowers are of no great beauty, but being produced at the  beginning of winter, and when flowers are scarce, are all the more  welcome. It requires protection in all but the warmer parts of these  islands.    P. ARBUTIFOLIA (_syns Crataegus arbutifolia_ and _Mespilus  arbutifolia_).--Arbutus-leaved Photinia, or Californian May-bush.  California, 1796. This is a very distinct shrub, with leaves resembling  those of the Strawberry Tree (Arbutus), the flowers in an elongated  panicle, and bright red bark on the young wood.    P. BENTHAMIANA is only worthy of culture for its neat habit and freedom  of growth when suitably placed.    P. SERRULATA (_syn Crataegus glabra_).--Chinese Hawthorn. Japan and  China, 1804. This has Laurel-like leaves, 4 inches or 5 inches long,  and, especially when young, of a beautiful rosy-chocolate colour, and  clustered at the branch-tips. Flowers small, white, and produced in flat  corymbs. An invaluable seaside shrub.    They all grow well either in light, rich loam, or in sandy, peaty earth,  and are usually propagated by grafting.      PHYLODOCE.

Dante stood benumbed, though conscious; as if he himself  had been turned to ice. He felt neither alive nor dead.    The lord of the dolorous empire, each of his arms as big as a giant,  stood in the ice half-way up his breast. He had one head, but three  faces; the middle, vermilion; the one over the right shoulder a pale  yellow; the other black. His sails of wings, huger than ever were beheld  at sea, were in shape and texture those of a bat; and with these be  constantly flapped, so as to send forth the wind that froze the depths  of Tartarus. From his six eyes the tears ran down, mingling at his three  chins with bloody foam; for at every mouth he crushed a sinner with his  teeth, as substances are broken up by an engine. The middle sinner was  the worst punished, for he was at once broken and flayed, and his head  and trunk were inside the mouth. It was Judas Iscariot.    Of the other two, whose heads were hanging out, one was Brutus, and the  other Cassius. Cassius was very large-limbed. Brutus writhed with agony,  but uttered not a word.[53]    \"Night has returned,\" said Virgil, \"and all has been seen. It is time to  depart onward.\"    Dante then, at his bidding, clasped, as Virgil did, the huge inattentive  being round the neck; and watching their opportunity, as the wings  opened and shut, they slipped round it, and so down his shaggy and  frozen sides, from pile to pile, clutching it as they went; till  suddenly, with the greatest labour and pain, they were compelled to turn  themselves upside down, as it seemed, but in reality to regain their  proper footing; for they had passed the centre of gravity, and become  Antipodes.    Then looking down at what lately was upward, they saw Lucifer with his  feet towards them; and so taking their departure, ascended a gloomy  vault, till at a distance, through an opening above their heads, they  beheld the loveliness of the stars.[54]      [Footnote 1: \"Parea che l'aer ne temesse.\"]    [Footnote 2: \"La dove 'l sol tace.\" \"The sun to me is dark, And _silent_  is the moon, Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.\"--Milton.]    [Footnote 3: There is great difference among the commentators respecting  the meaning of the three beasts; some supposing them passions, others  political troubles, others personal enemies, &c. The point is not of  much importance, especially as a mystery was intended; but nobody, as  Mr. Cary says, can doubt that the passage was suggested by one in the  prophet Jeremiah, v. 6: \"Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay  them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them; a leopard shall watch  over their cities.\"]    [Footnote 4:      \"Che quello 'mperador che la su regna    Perch' i' fu'ribellante a la sua legge,    Non vuol che 'n sua citta per me si vegna.\" ]        [Footnote 5:      \"Quale i fioretti dal notturno gelo    Chinati e chiusi, poi che 'l sol gl'imbianca,    Si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo.\"      Like as the flowers that with the frosty night    Are bowed and closed, soon as the sun returns,    Rise on their stems, all open and upright.]    [Footnote 6: This loss of intellectual good, and the confession of the  poet that he finds the inscription over hell-portal hard to understand  (_il senso lor m'e duro_), are among the passages in Dante which lead  some critics to suppose that his hell is nothing but an allegory,  intended at once to imply his own disbelief in it as understood by the  vulgar part of mankind, and his employment of it, nevertheless, as a  salutary check both to the foolish and the reflecting;--to the foolish,  as an alarm; and to the reflecting, as a parable. It is possible, in the  teeth of many appearances to the contrary, that such may have been the  case; but in the doubt that it affects either the foolish or the wise to  any good purpose, and in the certainty that such doctrines do a world  of mischief to tender consciences and the cause of sound piety, such  monstrous contradictions, in terms, of every sense of justice and  charity which God has implanted in the heart of man, are not to be  passed over without indignant comment.]    [Footnote 7: It is seldom that a boast of this kind--not, it must be  owned, bashful--has been allowed by posterity to be just; nay, in four  out of the five instances, below its claims.]    [Footnote 8:      \"Genti v'eran, con occhi tardi e gravi,    Di grande autorita ne' lor sembianti    Parlavan rado, con voci soavi.\" ]    [Footnote 9: \"Sopra 'l verde smalto.\" Mr. Cary has noticed the  appearance, for the first time, of this beautiful but now commonplace  image.]    [Footnote 10: \"Il maestro di color che sanno.\"]    [Footnote 11: This is the famous episode of Paulo and Francesca. She  was daughter to Count Guido da Polenta, lord of Ravenna, and wife to  Giovanni Malatesta, one of the sons, of the lord of Rimini. Paulo was  her brother-in-law. They were surprised together by the husband, and  slain on the spot. Particulars of their history will be found in the  Appendix, together with the whole original passage.      \"Quali colombe, dal disio chiamate,    Con l'ali aperte e ferme, al dolce nido    Volan per l'aer dal voler portate      Cotali uscir de la schiera ov'e Dido,    A noi venendo per l'aer maligno,    Si forte fu l'affettuoso grido.\"      As doves, drawn home from where they circled still,    Set firm their open wings, and through the air    Come sweeping, wafted by their pure good-will      So broke from Dido's flock that gentle pair,    Cleaving, to where we stood, the air malign,    Such strength to bring them had a loving prayer. ]    [Footnote 12: Francesca is to be conceived telling her story in anxious  intermitting sentences--now all tenderness for her lover, now angry at  their slayer; watching the poet's face, to see what he thinks, and  at times averting her own. I take this excellent direction from Ugo  Foscolo.]    [Footnote 13:      \"Nessun maggior dolore,    Che ricordarsi del tempo felice    Ne la miseria.\" ]    [Footnote 14:      \"Per piu fiate gli occhi ci sospinse    Quella lettura.\"  \"To look at one another,\" says Boccaccio; and his interpretation  has been followed by Cary and Foscolo; but, with deference to such  authorities, I beg leave to think that the poet meant no more than he  says, namely, that their eyes were simply \"suspended\"--hung, as it were,  over the book, without being able to read on; which is what I intended  to express (if I may allude to a production of which both those critics  were pleased to speak well), when, in my youthful attempt to enlarge  this story, I wrote \"And o'er the book they hung, and nothing said,  And every lingering page grew longer as they read.\"    _Story of Rimini._]    [Footnote 15:      \"Mentre che l'uno spirto questo disse,    L'altro piangeva si, che di pietade    I' venni men cosi com'io morisse,    E caddi come corpo morto cade.\"    This last line has been greatly admired for the corresponding deadness  of its expression.      While thus one spoke, the other spirit mourn'd    With wail so woful, that at his remorse    I felt as though I should have died. I turn'd    Stone-stiff; and to the ground, fell like a corse.    The poet fell thus on the ground (some of the commentators think)  because he had sinned in the same way; and if Foscolo's opinion could  be established--that the incident of the book is invention--their  conclusion would receive curious collateral evidence, the circumstance  of the perusal of the romance in company with a lady being likely enough  to have occurred to Dante. But the same probability applies in the case  of the lovers. The reading of such books was equally the taste of their  own times; and nothing is more likely than the volume's having been  found in the room where they perished. The Pagans could not be rebels  to a law they never heard of, any more than Dante could be a rebel  to Luther. But this is one of the absurdities with which the impious  effrontery or scarcely less impious admissions of Dante's teachers  avowedly set reason at defiance,--retaining, meanwhile, their right of  contempt for the impieties of Mahometans and Brahmins; \"which is odd,\"  as the poet says; for being not less absurd, or, as the others argued,  much more so, they had at least an equal claim on the submission of the  reason; since the greater the irrationality, the higher the theological  triumph.]    [Footnote 16: Plutus's exclamation about Satan is a great choke-pear to  the commentators. The line in the original is      \"Pape Satan, pape Satan aleppe.\"    The words, as thus written, are not Italian. It is not the business of  this abstract to discuss such points; and therefore I content myself  with believing that the context implies a call of alarm on the Prince of  Hell at the sight of the living creature and his guide.]    [Footnote 17: Phlegyas, a son of Mars, was cast into hell by Apollo for  setting the god's temple on fire in resentment for the violation of his  daughter Coronis. The actions of gods were not to be questioned, in  Dante's opinion, even though the gods turned out to be false Jugghanaut  is as good as any, while he lasts. It is an ethico-theological puzzle,  involving very nice questions; but at any rate, had our poet been a  Brahmin of Benares, we know how he would have written about it in  Sanscrit.]    [Footnote 18: Filippo Argenti (Philip _Silver_,--so called from his  shoeing his horse with the precious metal) was a Florentine remarkable  for bodily strength and extreme irascibility. What a barbarous strength  and confusion of ideas is there in this whole passage about him!  Arrogance punished by arrogance, a Christian mother blessed for the  unchristian disdainfulness of her son, revenge boasted of and enjoyed,  passion arguing in a circle! Filippo himself might have written it.  Dante says,      \"Con piangere e con lutto    Spirito maladetto, ti rimani.    Via costa con gli altri cani,\" &c.    Then Virgil, kissing and"]]]
