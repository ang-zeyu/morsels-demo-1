Mr. Tylor, whose opinion is entitled to the highest respect, thinks that  this may be a European myth, told by some settler to a black in the Greek  form, and then spread about among the natives.  He complains that the  story of the loss of the _brightest_ star does not fit the facts of the  case.    We do not know, and how can the Australians know, that the lost star was  once the brightest?  It appears to me that the Australians, remarking the  disappearances of a star, might very naturally suppose that the _Crow_  had selected for his wife that one which had been the most brilliant of  the cluster.  Besides, the wide distribution of the tale among the  natives, and the very great change in the nature of the incidents, seem  to point to a native origin.  Though the main conception--the loss of one  out of seven maidens--is identical in Greek and in Murri, the manner of  the disappearance is eminently Hellenic in the one case, eminently savage  in the other.  However this may be, nothing of course is proved by a  single example.  Let us next examine the stars Castor and Pollux.  Both  in Greece and in Australia these are said once to have been two young  men.  In the 'Catasterismoi,' already spoken of, we read: 'The Twins, or  Dioscouroi.--They were nurtured in Lacedaemon, and were famous for their  brotherly love, wherefore, Zeus, desiring to make their memory immortal,  placed them both among the stars.'  In Australia, according to Mr. Brough  Smyth ('Aborigines of Victoria'), Turree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux) are  two young men who pursue Purra and kill him at the commencement of the  great heat.  Coonar toorung (the mirage) is the smoke of the fire by  which they roast him.  In Greece it was not Castor and Pollux, but Orion  who was the great hunter placed among the stars.  Among the Bushmen of  South Africa, Castor and Pollux are not young men, but young women, the  wives of the Eland, the great native antelope.  In Greek star-stories the  Great Bear keeps watch, Homer says, on the hunter Orion for fear of a  sudden attack.  But how did the Bear get its name in Greece?  According  to Hesiod, the oldest Greek poet after Homer, the Bear was once a lady,  daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia.  She was a nymph of the train of  chaste Artemis, but yielded to the love of Zeus, and became the  ancestress of all the Arcadians (that is, Bear-folk).  In her bestial  form she was just about to be slain by her own son when Zeus rescued her  by raising her to the stars.  Here we must notice first, that the  Arcadians, like Australians, Red Indians, Bushmen, and many other wild  races, and like the Bedouins, believed themselves to be descended from an  animal.  That the early Egyptians did the same is not improbable; for  names of animals are found among the ancestors in the very oldest  genealogical papyrus, {128} as in the genealogies of the old English  kings.  Next the Arcadians transferred the ancestral bear to the heavens,  and, in doing this, they resembled the Peruvians, of whom Acosta says:  'They adored the star Urchuchilly, feigning it to be a Ram, and  worshipped two others, and say that one of them is a _sheep_, and the  other a lamb . . . others worshipped the star called the Tiger.  _They  were of opinion that there was not any beast or bird upon the earth,  whose shape or image did not shine in the heavens_.'    But to return to our bears.  The Australians have, properly speaking, no  bears, though the animal called the native bear is looked up to by the  aborigines with superstitious regard.  But among the North American  Indians, as the old missionaries Lafitau and Charlevoix observed, 'the  four stars in front of our constellation are a bear; those in the tail  are hunters who pursue him; the small star apart is the pot in which they  mean to cook him.'    It may be held that the Red Men derived their bear from the European  settlers.  But, as we have seen, an exact knowledge of the stars has  always been useful if not essential to savages; and we venture to doubt  whether they would confuse their nomenclature and sacred traditions by  borrowing terms from trappers and squatters.  But, if this is improbable,  it seems almost impossible that all savage races should have borrowed  their whole conception of the heavenly bodies from the myths of Greece.  It is thus that Egede, a missionary of the last century, describes the  Eskimo philosophy of the stars: 'The notions that the Greenlanders have  as to the origin of the heavenly lights--as sun, moon, and stars--are  very nonsensical; in that they pretend they have formerly been as many of  their own ancestors, who, on different accounts, were lifted up to  heaven, and became such glorious celestial bodies.'  Again, he writes:  'Their notions about the stars are that some of them have been men, and  others different sorts, of animals and fishes.'  But every reader of Ovid  knows that this was the very mythical theory of the Greeks and Romans.  The Egyptians, again, worshipped Osiris, Isis, and the rest as  _ancestors_, and there are even modern scholars, like Mr. Loftie in his  'Essay of Scarabs,' who hold Osiris to have been originally a real  historical person.  But the Egyptian priests who showed Plutarch the  grave of Osiris, showed him, too, the stars into which Osiris, Isis, and  Horus had been metamorphosed.  Here, then, we have Greeks, Egyptians, and  Eskimo, all agreed about the origin of the heavenly lights, all of  opinion that 'they have formerly been as many of their own ancestors.'    The Australian general theory is: 'Of the good men and women, after the  deluge, Pundjel (a kind of Zeus, or rather a sort of Prometheus of  Australian mythology) made stars.  Sorcerers (Biraark) can tell which  stars were once good men and women.'  Here the sorcerers have the same  knowledge as the Egyptian priests.  Again, just as among the Arcadians,  'the progenitors of the existing tribes, whether birds, or beasts, or  men, were set in the sky, and made to shine as stars.' {130}    We have already given some Australian examples in the stories of the  Pleiades, and of Castor and Pollux.  We may add the case of the Eagle.  In  Greece the Eagle was the bird of Zeus, who carried off Ganymede to be the  cup-bearer of Olympus.  Among the Australians this same constellation is  called Totyarguil; he was a man who, when bathing, was killed by a  fabulous animal, a kind of kelpie; as Orion, in Greece, was killed by the  Scorpion.  Like Orion, he was placed among the stars.  The Australians  have a constellation named Eagle, but he is our Sinus, or Dog-star.    The Indians of the Amazon are in one tale with the Australians and  Eskimo.  'Dr. Silva de Coutinho informs me,' says Professor Hartt, {131}  'that the Indians of the Amazonas not only give names to many of the  heavenly bodies, but also tell stories about them.  The two stars that  form the shoulders of Orion are said to be an old man and a boy in a  canoe, chasing a peixe boi, by which name is designated a dark spot in  the sky near the above constellation.'  The Indians also know  monkey-stars, crane-stars, and palm-tree stars.    The Bushmen, almost the lowest tribe of South Africa, have the same star-  lore and much the same myths as the Greeks, Australians, Egyptians, and  Eskimo.  According to Dr. Bleek, 'stars, and even the sun and moon, were  once mortals on earth, or even animals or inorganic substances, which  happened to get translated to the skies.  The sun was once a man, whose  arm-pit radiated a limited amount of light round his house.  Some  children threw him into the sky, and there he shines.'  The Homeric hymn  to Helios, in the same way, as Mr. Max Muller observes, 'looks on the sun  as a half-god, almost a hero, who had once lived on earth.'  The pointers  of the Southern Cross were 'two men who were lions,' just as Callisto, in  Arcadia, was a woman who was a bear.  It is not at all rare in those  queer philosophies, as in that of the Scandinavians, to find that the sun  or moon has been a man or woman.  In Australian fable the moon was a man,  the sun a woman of indifferent character, who appears at dawn in a coat  of red kangaroo skins, the present of an admirer.  In an old Mexican text  the moon was a man, across whose face a god threw a rabbit, thus making  the marks in the moon. {132a}    Many separate races seem to recognise the figure of a hare, where we see  'the Man in the Moon.'  In a Buddhist legend, an exemplary and altruistic  hare was translated to the moon.  'To the common people in India the  spots on the moon look like a hare, and Chandras, the god of the moon,  carries a hare: hence the moon is called sasin or sasanka, hare-mark.  The  Mongolians also see in these shadows the figure of a hare.' {132b}  Among  the Eskimo, the moon is a girl, who always flees from her cruel brother,  the sun, because he disfigured her face.  Elsewhere the sun is the girl,  beloved by her own brother, the moon; she blackens her face to avert his  affection.  On the Rio Branco, and among the Tomunda, the moon is a girl  who loved her brother and visited him in the dark.  He detected her  wicked passion by drawing his blackened hand over her face.  The marks  betrayed her, and, as the spots on the moon, remain to this day. {133}    Among the New Zealanders and North American Indians the sun is a great  beast, whom the hunters trapped and thrashed with cudgels.  His blood is  used in some New Zealand incantations; and, according to an Egyptian  myth, was kneaded into clay at the making of man.  But there is no end to  similar sun-myths, in all of which the sun is regarded as a man, or even  as a beast.    To return to the stars--    The Red Indians, as Schoolcraft says, 'hold many of the planets to be  transformed adventurers.'  The Iowas 'believed stars to be a sort of  living creatures.'  One of them came down and talked to a hunter, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#20)"],[1,"ops, Tomatoes, Beets, Celery Salad, Apple Trifle, Lady  Fingers, Cheese.

Pure atmospheric air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen and a very small  proportion of carbonic acid gas. Air once breathed has lost the chief  part of its oxygen, and acquired a proportionate increase of carbonic  acid gas. Therefore, health requires that we breathe the same air once  only.    The solid part of our bodies is continually wasting and requires to be  repaired by fresh substances. Therefore, food, which is to repair the  loss, should be taken with due regard to the exercise and waste of the  body.    The fluid part of our bodies also wastes constantly; there is but one  fluid in animals, which is water. Therefore, water only is necessary,  and no artifice can produce a better drink.    The fluid of our bodies is to the solid in proportion as nine to one.  Therefore, a like proportion should prevail in the total amount of  food taken.    Light exercises an important influence upon the growth and vigor of  animals and plants. Therefore, our dwellings should freely admit the  sun's rays.    Decomposing animal and vegetable substances yield various noxious  gases, which enter the lungs and corrupt the blood. Therefore, all  impurities should be kept away from our abodes, and every precaution  be observed to secure a pure atmosphere.    Warmth is essential to all the bodily functions. Therefore, an equal  bodily temperature should be maintained by exercise, by clothing or by  fire.    Exercise warms, invigorates and purifies the body; clothing preserves  the warmth the body generates; fire imparts warmth externally.  Therefore, to obtain and preserve warmth, exercise and clothing are  preferable to fire.    Fire consumes the oxygen of the air, and produces noxious gases.  Therefore, the air is less pure in the presence of candles, gas or  coal fire, than otherwise, and the deterioration should be repaired by  increased ventilation. The skin is a highly-organized membrane, full  of minute pores, cells, blood-vessels, and nerves; it imbibes moisture  or throws it off according to the state of the atmosphere or the  temperature of the body. It also \"breathes,\" like the lungs (though  less actively). All the internal organs sympathize with the skin.  Therefore, it should be repeatedly cleansed.    Late hours and anxious pursuits exhaust the nervous system and produce  disease and premature death. Therefore, the hours of labor and study  should be short.    Mental and bodily exercise are equally essential to the general health  and happiness. Therefore, labor and study should succeed each other.    Man will live most happily upon simple solids and fluids, of which  a sufficient but temperate quantity should be taken. Therefore,  over-indulgence in strong drinks, tobacco, snuff, opium, and all mere  indulgences, should be avoided.    Sudden alternations of heat and cold are dangerous (especially to the  young and the aged). Therefore, clothing, in quantity and quality,  should be adapted to the alternations of night and day, and of the  seasons. And therefore, also, drinking cold water when the body is  hot, and hot tea and soups when cold are productive of many evils.    Never visit a sick person (especially if the complaint be of a  contagious nature) with an empty stomach, as this disposes the system  more readily to receive the contagion. And in attending a sick person,  place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed  of the diseased; not between the diseased person and any fire that is  in the room, as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapor in  that direction.      MOTHER SHIPTON'S PROPHECY.--The lines known as \"Mother Shipton's  Prophecy\" were first published in England in 1485, before the  discovery of America, and, of course, before any of the discoveries  and inventions mentioned therein. All the events predicted have come  to pass except that in the last two lines.          Carriages without horses shall go,        And accidents fill the world with woe.          Around the world thoughts shall fly        In the twinkling of an eye.          Waters shall yet more wonders do,        Now strange, yet shall be true.          The world upside down shall be,        And gold be found at root of tree.          Through hills man shall ride,        And no horse nor ass be at his side.          Under water man shall walk,        Shall ride, shall sleep, shall talk.          In the air men shall be seen        In white, in black, in green.          Iron in the water shall float,        As easy as a wooden boat.          Gold shall be found 'mid stone,        In a land that's now unknown.          Fire and water shall wonders do,        England shall at last admit a Jew.          And this world to an end shall come        In eighteen hundred and eighty-one.      CAPTAIN KIDD, a notorious American pirate, was born about 1650. In  1696 he was entrusted by the British Government with the command of  a privateer, and sailed from New York, for the purpose of suppressing  the numerous pirates then infesting the seas. He went to the East  Indies, where he began a career of piracy, and returned to New York in  1698 with a large amount of booty. He was soon after arrested, sent to  England for trial, and executed in 1701.
