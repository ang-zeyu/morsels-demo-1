And in the second place, to secure his passage he sent over about  200 men, and after that 200 more, who had orders to cast up a large  ravelin on the other bank, just where he designed to land his bridge.  This was done with such expedition too, that it was finished before  night, and in condition to receive all the shot of Tilly's great  battery, and effectually covered his bridge. While this was doing the  king on his side lays over his bridge. Both sides wrought hard all  day and night, as if the spade, not the sword, had been to decide  the controversy, and that he had got the victory whose trenches and  batteries were first ready. In the meanwhile the cannon and musket  bullets flew like hail, and made the service so hot that both sides  had enough to do to make their men stand to their work. The king, in  the hottest of it, animated his men by his presence, and Tilly, to  give him his due, did the same; for the execution was so great, and  so many officers killed, General Altringer wounded, and two  sergeant-majors killed, that at last Tilly himself was obliged  to expose himself, and to come up to the very face of our line to  encourage his men, and give his necessary orders.    And here about one o'clock, much about the time that the king's  brigade and works were finished, and just as they said he had ordered  to fall on upon our ravelin with 3000 foot, was the brave old  Tilly slain with a musket ball in the thigh. He was carried off to  Ingolstadt, and lived some days after, but died of that wound the  same day as the king had his horse shot under him at the siege of that  town.    We made no question of passing the river here, having brought  everything so forward, and with such extraordinary success; but we  should have found it a very hot piece of work if Tilly had lived one  day more, and, if I may give my opinion of it, having seen Tilly's  battery and breastwork, in the face of which we must have passed the  river, I must say that, whenever we had marched, if Tilly had fallen  in with his horse and foot, placed in that trench, the whole army  would have passed as much danger as in the face of a strong town in  the storming a counterscarp. The king himself, when he saw with what  judgment Tilly had prepared his works, and what danger he must have  run, would often say that day's success was every way equal to the  victory of Leipsic.    Tilly being hurt and carried off, as if the soul of the army had been  lost, they began to draw off. The Duke of Bavaria took horse and rid  away as if he had fled out of battle for his life.    The other generals, with a little more caution, as well as courage,  drew off by degrees, sending their cannon and baggage away first, and  leaving some to continue firing on the bank of the river, to conceal  their retreat. The river preventing any intelligence, we knew nothing  of the disaster befallen them; and the king, who looked for blows,  having finished his bridge and ravelin, ordered to run a line with  palisadoes to take in more ground on the bank of the river, to cover  the first troops he should send over. This being finished the same  night, the king sends over a party of his guards to relieve the men  who were in the ravelin, and commanded 600 musketeers to man the new  line out of the Scots brigade.    Early in the morning a small party of Scots, commanded by one Captain  Forbes, of my Lord Reay's regiment, were sent out to learn something  of the enemy, the king observing they had not fired all night; and  while this party were abroad, the army stood in battalia; and my old  friend Sir John Hepburn, whom of all men the king most depended upon  for any desperate service, was ordered to pass the bridge with his  brigade, and to draw up without the line, with command to advance as  he found the horse, who were to second him, come over.    Sir John being passed without the trench, meets Captain Forbes with  some prisoners, and the good news of the enemy's retreat. He sends him  directly to the king, who was by this time at the head of his army,  in full battalia, ready to follow his vanguard, expecting a hot day's  work of it. Sir John sends messenger after messenger to the king,  entreating him to give him orders to advance; but the king would not  suffer him, for he was ever upon his guard, and would not venture a  surprise; so the army continued on this side the Lech all day and the  next night. In the morning the king sent for me, and ordered me to  draw out 300 horse, and a colonel with 600 horse, and a colonel with  800 dragoons, and ordered us to enter the wood by three ways, but  so as to be able to relieve one another; and then ordered Sir John  Hepburn with his brigade to advance to the edge of the wood to secure  our retreat, and at the same time commanded another brigade of foot to  pass the bridge, if need were, to second Sir John Hepburn, so warily  did this prudent general proceed.    We advanced with our horse into the Bavarian camp, which we found  forsaken. The plunder of it was inconsiderable, for the exceeding  caution the king had used gave them time to carry off all their  baggage. We followed them three or four miles, and returned to our  camp.    I confess I was most diverted that day with viewing the works which  Tilly had cast up, and must own again that had he not been taken off  we had met with as desperate a piece of work as ever was attempted.  The next day the rest of the cavalry came up to us, commanded by  Gustavus Horn, and the king and the whole army followed. We advanced  through the heart of Bavaria, took Rain at the first summons, and  several other small towns, and sat down before Augsburg.    Augsburg, though a Protestant city, had a Popish Bavarian garrison  in it of above 5000 men, commanded by a Fugger, a great family in  Bavaria. The governor had posted several little parties as out-scouts  at the distance of two miles and a half or three miles from the town.  The king, at his coming up to this town, sends me with my little troop  and three companies of dragoons to beat in these out-scouts. The first  party I lighted on was not above sixteen men, who had made a small  barricado across the road, and stood resolutely upon their guard. I  commanded the dragoons to alight and open the barricado, which, while  they resolutely performed, the sixteen men gave them two volleys of  their muskets, and through the enclosures made their retreat to a  turnpike about a quarter of a mile farther. We passed their first  traverse, and coming up to the turnpike, I found it defended by 200  musketeers. I prepared to attack them, sending word to the king how  strong the enemy was, and desired some foot to be sent me. My dragoons  fell on, and though the enemy made a very hot fire, had beat them from  this post before 200 foot, which the king had sent me, had come  up. Being joined with the foot, I followed the enemy, who retreated  fighting, till they came under the cannon of a strong redoubt, where  they drew up, and I could see another body of foot of about 300 join  them out of the works; upon which I halted, and considering I was in  view of the town, and a great way from the army, I faced about and  began to march off. As we marched I found the enemy followed, but  kept at a distance, as if they only designed to observe me. I had not  marched far, but I heard a volley of small shot, answered by two or  three more, which I presently apprehended to be at the turnpike,  where I had left a small guard of twenty-six men with a lieutenant.  Immediately I detached 100 dragoons to relieve my men and secure  my retreat, following myself as fast as the foot could march. The  lieutenant sent me back word the post was taken by the enemy, and my  men cut off. Upon this I doubled my pace, and when I came up I found  it as the lieutenant said; for the post was taken and manned with 300  musketeers and three troops of horse. By this time, also, I found the  party in my rear made up towards me, so that I was like to be charged  in a narrow place both in front and rear.    I saw there was no remedy but with all my force to fall upon that  party before me, and so to break through before those from the town  could come up with me; wherefore, commanding my dragoons to alight, I  ordered them to fall on upon the foot. Their horse were drawn up in  an enclosed field on one side of the road, a great ditch securing the  other side, so that they thought if I charged the foot in front they  would fall upon my flank, while those behind would charge my rear;  and, indeed, had the other come in time, they had cut me off. My  dragoons made three fair charges on their foot, but were received with  so much resolution and so brisk a fire, that they were beaten off, and  sixteen men killed. Seeing them so rudely handled, and the horse ready  to fall in, I relieved them with 100 musketeers, and they renewed  the attack; at the same time, with my troop of horse, flanked on both  wings with fifty musketeers, I faced their horse, but did not offer  to charge them. The case grew now desperate, and the enemy behind  were just at my heels with near 600 men. The captain who commanded the  musketeers who flanked my horse came up to me; says he, \"If we do not  force this pass all will be lost; if you will draw out your troop and  twenty of my foot, and fall in, I'll engage to keep off the horse with  the rest.\" \"With all my heart,\" says I.    Immediately I wheeled off my troop, and a small party of the  musketeers followed me, and fell in with the dragoons and foot, who,  seeing the danger too as well as I, fought like madmen. The foot at  the turnpike were not able to hinder our breaking through, so we  made our way out, killing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#20)"],[1,"often play the piano  loudly, and some think best of all.  One plays a particular piece to divert  anger, viz., the \"Devil's Sonata.\"  A man goes down cellar and saws wood,  which he keeps for such occasions.  A boy pounds a resonant eavespout. One  throws a heavy stone against a white rock.  Many go off by themselves and  indulge in the luxury of expressions they want none to hear. Others take out  their tantrum on the dog or cat or perhaps a younger child, or implicate  some absent enemy, while others curse.  A few wound themselves, and so on,  till it almost seems, in view of this long list of vicariates, as if almost  any attack, psychic or physical, might thus be intensified, and almost  anything or person be made the object of passion. Be it remembered, too,  that not a few look, do, think, feel their best under this impulsion.    II.  Besides these modes of Abreagierung there are countless forms of  sublimation.  In anger a boy says:  I will avenge myself on the bully who  whipped me and whom I cannot or will not whip, by besting him in his  studies, class-work, composition, or learn skilful stunts that he cannot do,  dress, or behave better, use better language, keep better company, and thus  find my triumph and revenge.  A man rejected or scorned by a woman sometimes  makes a great man of himself, with the motivation more or less developed to  make her sorry or humiliated. Anger may prompt a man to go in to win his  enemy's girl. A taunt or an insult sometimes spurs the victim of it to  towering ambition to show the world and especially the abuser better, and to  be able to despise him in return; and there are those who have been thus  stung to attempt greatness and find the sweetest joy of success in the  feeling that by attaining it they compensate for indignities they suffered  in youth. In fact, when we analyze ambition and the horror of  Minderwertigkeit that goes with it, we shall doubtless find this factor is  never entirely absent, while if we were to apply the same pertinacity and  subtlety that Jung in his \"Wandlungen\" has brought to bear in working over  the treacherous material of mythology, we might prove with no less  verisimilitude than he has shown the primacy of the libido that in the  beginning was anger, and that not Anaxagoras' love or the strife of  Heraclitus was the fons et origo of all things, that the Ichtrieb is basal,  and that the fondest and most comprehensive of all motives is that to excel  others, not merely to survive, but to win a larger place in the sun, and  that there is some connection between the Darwinian psychogenesis and Max  Stirner and Nietzsche, which Adler has best evaluated.    III.  Anger has also its dreams and reveries.  When wronged the imagination  riots in fancied humiliation and even tortures of an enemy.  An object of  hate may be put through almost every conceivable series of degradation,  ridicule, exposure and disgrace. He is seen by others for what our hate  deems him to be. All disguises are stripped off.  Children sometimes fancy a  hated object of anger flogged until he is raw, abandoned by all his friends,  an outcast, homeless, alone, in the dark, starving, exposed to wild animals,  and far more often more prosaic fancies conceive him as whipped by a parent  or stronger friend, or by the victim himself later.  Very clever strategies  are thought out in detail by which the weaker gets even with or vanquishes  the stronger, and one who suffers a rankling sense of injustice can hardly  help day-dreaming of some form of comeuppance for his foe, although it takes  years to do it. In these reveries the injurer in the end almost always gives  up and sues for mercy at the feet of his quondam victim. So weird and  dramatic are these scenes often that to some minds we must call anger and  hate the chief springs of the imagination. A pubescent girl who was deeply  offended went off by herself and held an imaginary funeral of her enemy,  hearing in fancy the disparaging remarks of the bystanders, and when it was  all over and the reaction came, she made up with the object of her passion  by being unusually sweet to her and even became solicitous about her health  as fearing that her revery might come true. We all too remember Tolstoi's  reminiscences when, having been flogged by his tutor, he slunk off to the  attic, weeping and broken-hearted, and finally after a long brooding  resolved to run away and become a soldier, and this he did in fancy,  becoming corporal, lieutenant, captain, colonel.  Finally came a great  battle where he led a desperate charge that was crowned with victory, and  when all was over and he stood tottering, leaning on his sword, bloody and  with many a wound, and the great Czar of all the Russias approached, saluted  him as saviour of his fatherland and told him to ask whatever he wanted and  it was his, replied magnanimously that he had only done his duty and wanted  no reward.  All he asked was that his tutor might be brought up and his head  cut off.  Then the scene changed to other situations, each very different,  florid with details, but motivated by ending in the discomfiture of the  tutor. In the ebb or ambivalent reaction of this passion he and the tutor  got on better.    IV.  Richardson has collected 882 cases of mild anger, introspected by  graduate students of psychology, and finds not only over-determination,  anger fetishes and occasionally anger in dreams with patent and latent  aspects and about all the Freudian mechanisms, but what is more important,  finds very much of the impulsion that makes us work and strive, attack and  solve problems has an element of anger at its root. Life is a battle and for  every real conquest man has had to summate and focus all his energies, so  that anger is the acme of the manifestation of Schopenhauer's will to live,  achieve and excel. Hiram Stanley rather absurdly described it as an epoch  when primitive man first became angry and fought, overcoming the great  quaternary carnivora and made himself the lord of creation.  Plato said  anger was the basis of the state, Ribot made it the establisher of justice  in the world, and Bergson thinks society rests on anger at vice and crime,  while Stekel thinks that temper qualities should henceforth be treated in  every biography and explored in every case that is psychoanalyzed. Hill's  experiments with pugilism, and Cannon's plea for athletics as a legitimate  surrogate for war in place of James' moral substitute, Frank Howard's  opinion that an impulse that Darwin finds as early as the sixth week and  hardly any student of childhood later than the sixth month, and which should  not be repressed but developed to its uttermost, although carefully directed  to worthy objects, are all in point. Howard pleads for judicious scolding  and flogging, to be, done in heat and not in cold blood, and says that there  is enough anger in the world, were it only rightly directed, to sweep away  all the evils in it. In all these phenomena there is no trace of sex or any  of its symbols, and sadism can never explain but must be explained by it. My  thesis is, then, that every Freudian mechanism applies to anger as truly as  it does to sex.  This by no means assumes the fundamental identity of every  feeling-emotion in the sense of Weissfeld's very speculative theory.    In this very slight paper I am only trying to make the single point which I  think fear and sympathy or the gregarious or social instinct would still  better illustrate, although it would require more time, that the movement  inaugurated by Freud opens up a far larger field than that of sex.  The  unconscious that introspectionists deny, (asserting that all phenomena  ascribed to it are only plain neural mechanisms, and therefore outside the  realm of psychology,) the feelings which introspection can confessedly never  tell much about and concerning which our text-books in psychology still say  so little: studies in these fields are marking a new epoch, and here the  chief merit of Freudism is found.        THE NECESSITY OF METAPHYSICS    BY JAMES J. PUTNAM, M. D.    SOME years ago, at the Weimar Congress of the International Psychoanalytic  Association, I read a paper on the importance of a knowledge of philosophy  and metaphysics for psychoanalysts regarded as students of human life.  Perhaps if I had had the experience and ability to contribute the results of  some original analytic investigation on specific lines, I should not then  have ventured into the philosophic field. Perhaps, indeed, if those  conditions now obtained I should not be bringing forward similar arguments  again, and if any one feels tempted to maintain that philosophic speculation  is a camp of refuge for those who, in consequence of temperamental  limitations and infantile fixations which ought to be overcome, draw back  from the more robust study of emotional repressions on scientific lines, I  should admit that the allegation contains an element of truth. But in spite  of this, and in spite of the fact that there is some truth also in the  statement that the effects--good and bad--of emotional repression make  themselves felt, as a partial influence, in all the highest reaches of human  endeavor, including art, literature, and religion;--in spite of these  partial truths, philosophy and metaphysics are the only means through which  the essential nature of many tendencies can be studied of which  psychoanalysis describes only the transformations. And this being so it is  perhaps reasonable that one paper should be read at an annual meeting such  as this, where men assemble whose duty it is to study the human mind in all  its aspects.    I presume that just as, and just because men have minds AND bodies, an  evolutional history in the ordinary sense and a mental history in a sense  not commonly considered, so there will always be two, or perhaps three,  parties among psychologists and men of science,"]]]
