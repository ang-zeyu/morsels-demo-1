To that  end he tied his blanket upon Ring and gave Whitie the extra lasso and  the rabbit to carry. Then, with the rifle and saddle-bags slung upon his  back, he took up the girl. She did not awaken from heavy slumber.    That climb up under the rugged, menacing brows of the broken cliffs,  in the face of a grim, leaning boulder that seemed to be weary of its  age-long wavering, was a tax on strength and nerve that Venters  felt equally with something sweet and strangely exulting in its  accomplishment. He did not pause until he gained the narrow divide and  there he rested. Balancing Rock loomed huge, cold in the gray light  of dawn, a thing without life, yet it spoke silently to Venters: \"I am  waiting to plunge down, to shatter and crash, roar and boom, to bury  your trail, and close forever the outlet to Deception Pass!\"    On the descent of the other side Venters had easy going, but was  somewhat concerned because Whitie appeared to have succumbed to  temptation, and while carrying the rabbit was also chewing on it. And  Ring evidently regarded this as an injury to himself, especially as he  had carried the heavier load. Presently he snapped at one end of the  rabbit and refused to let go. But his action prevented Whitie from  further misdoing, and then the two dogs pattered down, carrying the  rabbit between them.    Venters turned out of the gorge, and suddenly paused stock-still,  astounded at the scene before him. The curve of the great stone bridge  had caught the sunrise, and through the magnificent arch burst a  glorious stream of gold that shone with a long slant down into the  center of Surprise Valley. Only through the arch did any sunlight  pass, so that all the rest of the valley lay still asleep, dark green,  mysterious, shadowy, merging its level into walls as misty and soft as  morning clouds.    Venters then descended, passing through the arch, looking up at its  tremendous height and sweep. It spanned the opening to Surprise Valley,  stretching in almost perfect curve from rim to rim. Even in his hurry  and concern Venters could not but feel its majesty, and the thought came  to him that the cliff-dwellers must have regarded it as an object of  worship.    Down, down, down Venters strode, more and more feeling the weight of his  burden as he descended, and still the valley lay below him. As all  other canyons and coves and valleys had deceived him, so had this deep,  nestling oval. At length he passed beyond the slope of weathered stone  that spread fan-shape from the arch, and encountered a grassy terrace  running to the right and about on a level with the tips of the oaks and  cottonwoods below. Scattered here and there upon this shelf were clumps  of aspens, and he walked through them into a glade that surpassed in  beauty and adaptability for a wild home, any place he had ever seen.  Silver spruces bordered the base of a precipitous wall that rose  loftily. Caves indented its surface, and there were no detached ledges  or weathered sections that might dislodge a stone. The level ground,  beyond the spruces, dropped down into a little ravine. This was one  dense line of slender aspens from which came the low splashing of water.  And the terrace, lying open to the west, afforded unobstructed view of  the valley of green treetops.    For his camp Venters chose a shady, grassy plot between the silver  spruces and the cliff. Here, in the stone wall, had been wonderfully  carved by wind or washed by water several deep caves above the level of  the terrace. They were clean, dry, roomy.    He cut spruce boughs and made a bed in the largest cave and laid the  girl there. The first intimation that he had of her being aroused from  sleep or lethargy was a low call for water.    He hurried down into the ravine with his canteen. It was a shallow,  grass-green place with aspens growing up everywhere. To his delight  he found a tiny brook of swift-running water. Its faint tinge of amber  reminded him of the spring at Cottonwoods, and the thought gave him a  little shock. The water was so cold it made his fingers tingle as he  dipped the canteen. Having returned to the cave, he was glad to see the  girl drink thirstily. This time he noted that she could raise her head  slightly without his help.    \"You were thirsty,\" he said. \"It's good water. I've found a fine place.  Tell me--how do you feel?\"    \"There's pain--here,\" she replied, and moved her hand to her left side.    \"Why, that's strange! Your wounds are on your right side. I believe  you're hungry. Is the pain a kind of dull ache--a gnawing?\"    \"It's like--that.\"    \"Then it's hunger.\" Venters laughed, and suddenly caught himself with a  quick breath and felt again the little shock. When had he laughed? \"It's  hunger,\" he went on. \"I've had that gnaw many a time. I've got it now.  But you mustn't eat. You can have all the water you want, but no food  just yet.\"    \"Won't I--starve?\"    \"No, people don't starve easily. I've discovered that. You must lie  perfectly still and rest and sleep--for days.\"    \"My hands--are dirty; my face feels--so hot and sticky; my boots hurt.\"  It was her longest speech as yet, and it trailed off in a whisper.    \"Well, I'm a fine nurse!\"    It annoyed him that he had never thought of these things. But then,  awaiting her death and thinking of her comfort were vastly different  matters. He unwrapped the blanket which covered her. What a slender girl  she was! No wonder he had been able to carry her miles and pack her up  that slippery ladder of stone. Her boots were of soft, fine leather,  reaching clear to her knees. He recognized the make as one of a  boot-maker in Sterling. Her spurs, that he had stupidly neglected to  remove, consisted of silver frames and gold chains, and the rowels,  large as silver dollars, were fancifully engraved. The boots slipped off  rather hard. She wore heavy woollen rider's stockings, half length, and  these were pulled up over the ends of her short trousers. Venters took  off the stockings to note her little feet were red and swollen. He  bathed them. Then he removed his scarf and bathed her face and hands.    \"I must see your wounds now,\" he said, gently.    She made no reply, but watched him steadily as he opened her blouse and  untied the bandage. His strong fingers trembled a little as he removed  it. If the wounds had reopened! A chill struck him as he saw the angry  red bullet-mark, and a tiny stream of blood winding from it down her  white breast. Very carefully he lifted her to see that the wound in her  back had closed perfectly. Then he washed the blood from her breast,  bathed the wound, and left it unbandaged, open to the air.    Her eyes thanked him.    \"Listen,\" he said, earnestly. \"I've had some wounds, and I've seen many.  I know a little about them. The hole in your back has closed. If you lie  still three days the one in your breast will close and you'll be safe.  The danger from hemorrhage will be over.\"    He had spoken with earnest sincerity, almost eagerness.    \"Why--do you--want me--to get well?\" she asked, wonderingly.    The simple question seemed unanswerable except on grounds of humanity.  But the circumstances under which he had shot this strange girl, the  shock and realization, the waiting for death, the hope, had resulted in  a condition of mind wherein Venters wanted her to live more than he had  ever wanted anything. Yet he could not tell why. He believed the killing  of the rustler and the subsequent excitement had disturbed him. For how  else could he explain the throbbing of his brain, the heat of his blood,  the undefined sense of full hours, charged, vibrant with pulsating  mystery where once they had dragged in loneliness?    \"I shot you,\" he said, slowly, \"and I want you to get well so I shall  not have killed a woman. But--for your own sake, too--\"    A terrible bitterness darkened her eyes, and her lips quivered.    \"Hush,\" said Venters. \"You've talked too much already.\"    In her unutterable bitterness he saw a darkness of mood that could not  have been caused by her present weak and feverish state. She hated the  life she had led, that she probably had been compelled to lead. She  had suffered some unforgivable wrong at the hands of Oldring. With that  conviction Venters felt a shame throughout his body, and it marked the  rekindling of fierce anger and ruthlessness. In the past long year he  had nursed resentment. He had hated the wilderness--the loneliness of  the uplands. He had waited for something to come to pass. It had come.  Like an Indian stealing horses he had skulked into the recesses of the  canyons. He had found Oldring's retreat; he had killed a rustler; he had  shot an unfortunate girl, then had saved her from this unwitting act,  and he meant to save her from the consequent wasting of blood, from  fever and weakness. Starvation he had to fight for her and for himself.  Where he had been sick at the letting of blood, now he remembered it in  grim, cold calm. And as he lost that softness of nature, so he lost his  fear of men. He would watch for Oldring, biding his time, and he would  kill this great black-bearded rustler who had held a girl in bondage,  who had used her to his infamous ends.    Venters surmised this much of the change in him--idleness had passed;  keen, fierce vigor flooded his mind and body; all that had happened to  him at Cottonwoods seemed remote and hard to recall; the difficulties  and perils of the present absorbed him, held him in a kind of spell.    First, then, he fitted up the little cave adjoining the girl's room  for his own comfort and use. His next work was to build a fireplace of  stones and to gather a store of wood. That done, he spilled the contents  of his saddle-bags upon the grass and took stock. His outfit consisted  of a small-handled axe, a hunting-knife, a large number of cartridges  for rifle or revolver, a tin plate, a cup, and a fork and spoon,  a quantity of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#20)"],[1,"we did not eat  this meat, they removed it from before us. Finally, the fourth course  was a piece of wild ox, the fattest morsels of which were placed in  our mouths.... We thus pushed forward and no longer saw so many  prairies, because both shores of the river are bordered with lofty  trees. The cotton wood, elm and bass wood are admirable for their  height and thickness. There are great numbers of wild cattle whom we  hear bellowing. We killed a little parroquet, with a red and yellow  head and green body.... We have got down to near the 33 deg. of  latitude.... We heard from afar savages who were inciting one another  to attack us by their continual yelling. They were armed with bows and  arrows, hatchets, clubs, and shields.... Part of them embarked in  great wooden canoes, some to ascend, others to descend the river in  order to surround us on all sides.... Some young men threw themselves  into the water and seized my canoe, but the current compelled them to  return to land. One of them hurled his club, which passed over without  striking us. In vain I showed the calumet (pipe of peace), and made  them signs that we were not coming to war against them. The alarm  continued; they were already preparing to pierce us with arrows from  all sides when God suddenly touched the hearts of the old men who were  standing at the water's edge, who checked the ardour of their young  men.... Whereon we landed, not without fear on our part. First we had  to speak by signs, because none of them understood the six languages  which I spoke. At last we found an old man who could speak a little  Illinois. We informed them that we were going to the sea.    \"The next day was spent in feasting on Indian corn and dogs' flesh.  The people here had an abundance of Indian corn, which they sowed at  all seasons. They cook it in great earthen jars which are very well  made, and also have plates of baked earth. The men go naked and wear  their hair short; they pierce their noses, from which, as well as from  their ears, hang beads.... Their cabins are made of bark, and are long  and wide. They sleep at the two ends, which are raised two feet above  the ground. They know nothing of the beaver, and their wealth consists  in the skins of wild cattle. They never see snow in their country, and  recognize the winter only through the rains.\"    The expedition had passed the confluence of the Missouri and that of  the Ohio, and had finally reached the place where the Arkansas River  enters the Mississippi. Here the Frenchmen gathered from the natives  that the sea was only ten days distant, and this sea they knew (for  Jolliet was able to take astronomical observations and to make a rough  survey) could only be the Gulf of Mexico. Jolliet feared if he  prosecuted his journey any farther, he and his people would fall into  the hands of the Spaniards and be imprisoned, if not killed.  Therefore, at this point on the Lower Mississippi, the expedition  turned back. Its return journey was a weary business, for the current  was against the canoes as they were propelled northwards up the Great  River. But Jolliet learnt from the natives of a better homeward route,  that of following the Illinois River upstream until the expedition  came within a very short distance of Lake Michigan, near where Chicago  now stands. The canoes were carried over a low ridge of ground,  launched again in the Chicago River, and so passed into Lake Michigan.  (There is, in fact, at this point the remains of an ancient water  connection between Lake Michigan and the Illinois River, and a canal  now connects the two systems.) Jolliet, in describing this region,  realized that by cutting a canal through two miles of prairie it would  be possible to go \"in a small ship\" from Lake Erie or Lake Superior  \"to Florida\".    Father Marquette remained at his new mission on the Fox River (he died  two years afterwards on the shores of the Straits of Michili-makinak).  Jolliet, on returning by way of the Ottawa River to Quebec, was nearly  drowned in the La Chine Rapids (Montreal), and all his papers and maps  were lost. The natives with him also perished, but he struggled to  shore with difficulty, and went on his way to Quebec to report his  wonderful discoveries to the Governor, Frontenac. Fortunately Father  Marquette had also kept a journal and had made maps, and these  reaching the superior of his mission arrived in time to confirm  Jolliet's statements.    Jolliet married at Quebec, and proceeded to explore and develop the  regions along the north coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, travelling  in this work as far as Hudson's Bay. He was given by the French  Government the Island of Anticosti as a reward for his achievements,  but the work and capital which he put into the development of this  long-neglected island came to nothing; for it was captured by the  English, and Jolliet died a poor man whilst attempting to explore the  coast of Labrador.    As to ROBERT CAVALIER DE LA SALLE, he had, after all, discovered the  Ohio, and had descended that river as far as the site of the present  town of Louisville. Then he interested the Governor (Frontenac) of  Canada in his enterprises. A fort, called Fort Frontenac, was built at  what is now Kingston, at the point where the St. Lawrence leaves Lake  Ontario. La Salle returned to France, and obtained the grant of the  lordship of this fort and the surrounding country on conditions of  maintaining the whole cost of the establishment, and making a  settlement of colonists. Another visit to France in 1677-8 secured him  further support and capital, and he returned from France with a  companion, Henry de Tonty.    La Salle, with de Tonty, started from Fort Frontenac in September,  1678, so intensely anxious to commence his discoveries that he  disregarded the difficulties of the winter season. On his way to  Niagara he paid a visit to the Iroquois to conciliate them, and  cleverly got from them permission to build a vessel on Lake Erie and  also to erect a blacksmith's forge, near where Niagara now stands. The  blacksmith's forge grew rapidly into a fort before the Indians were  aware of what was being done. By August, 1679, he had built and  launched (in spite of extraordinary calamities and misfortunes) on the  Upper Niagara River the first sailing boat which ever appeared on the  four great upper lakes of the St. Lawrence basin.    In this ship he sailed through Lake Erie and past Detroit into Lake  Huron, and thence to Green Bay (Lake Michigan), stopping at intervals  amongst the canoes of the amazed natives, who for the first time heard  the sound of cannon, for he had armed his vessel with guns. At Green  Bay he collected a large quantity of furs, which had been obtained in  trade by the men he had sent on in advance. He loaded up his sailing  boat, the _Griffon_, and sent her on a voyage back to the east to  transport this splendid load of furs to the merchants with whom he had  become deeply indebted. Unhappily the _Griffon_ foundered in a storm  on Lake Michigan, and was never heard of again. Meantime La Salle,  with de Tonty and Father HENNEPIN, the discoverer of Niagara, had  travelled in canoes to the south-east end of Lake Michigan, had passed  up the Joseph River, and thence by portage into the Kankaki, which  flows into the Illinois. This river he descended till he stopped near  the site of the modern Peoria. Below this place he built a fort--for  it was winter time--and although the natives were not very friendly he  collected enough information from them to satisfy himself that he  could easily pass down the Illinois to the Mississippi.    He sent one of the Frenchmen, Michel Accault, together with Father  Hennepin, to explore the Illinois down to the Mississippi; de Tonty he  placed in charge of the fort with a small garrison; and then himself,  on the last day of February, 1680, started to walk overland from Lake  Michigan to Detroit. Eventually, by means of a canoe, which he  constructed himself, he regained Fort Frontenac and Montreal. When he  returned to Fort Crevecoeur, on the Illinois River,[11] it was to meet  with the signs of a horrible disaster. The Iroquois in his absence had  descended on the place with a great war party. They had massacred the  Illinois people dwelling in a big settlement near the fort, and the  remains of their mutilated bodies were scattered all over the place.  Their town had been burnt; the fort was empty and abandoned. There  were no traces of the Frenchmen, however, amongst the skulls and  skeletons lying around him; for the skulls retained sufficient hair to  show that they belonged to Amerindians. Nevertheless, he deposited his  new stock of goods and most of his men in the ruins of the Fort  Crevecoeur, and descended the River Illinois to the Mississippi. But  he was obliged to turn back. On the west bank of the river were the  scared Illinois Indians, on the east the raging Iroquois. Whenever La  Salle could safely visit a deserted camp he would examine the remains  of the tortured men tied to stakes to see if amongst them there was a  Frenchman.    [Footnote 11: He had named this place \"Heartbreak\" because when  building it he had learnt of the loss of his sailing ship _Griffon_,  with the splendid supply of furs which was to have paid off his debts,  with all his reserve supplies and his men. This was not the limit of  his troubles; for, after the overland journey of appalling hardships  through a country of melting ice, flood, swamp, and hostile  Iroquois--the Iroquois being furious with La Salle for having  outwitted them in the building of this fort, and seeking him  everywhere to destroy him--when he got to Montreal it was only to  learn that a ship, coming from France with further supplies for his  great journey had been wrecked at the mouth of the St. Lawrence!]    But de Tonty was not dead. After incredible adventures he had escaped  the raids of the Iroquois"]]]
