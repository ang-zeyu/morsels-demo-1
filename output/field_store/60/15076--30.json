This surprising Jew is  surprising us anew. From all corners of the earth they are gathering as  not since the scattering to the Assyrian plains, gathering to discuss and  plan for the getting into shape as a nation again on the old home soil.  Jews of every sort, utterly diverse in every other imaginable way, except  this of being Jews, men who hate each other intensely because of divergent  beliefs in other matters, yet brushing elbows in annual gatherings to plan  with all their old time intensity a new Jewish nation. Along the highways  of earth, made and controlled by Christian peoples, they come. What does  it mean? They continue to be, as they have been, the puzzle of history.    This tragic break of the kingdom and the persistency of the King's plan  regardless of the break hold the key to the puzzle. The Jew has been  preserved, divinely preserved, against every attempt at his destruction.  For he is the keystone in the arch of the King's plan for a coming  world-wide dominion.    Jesus is God's spirit-magnet for the Jew and for all men. Around Him they  will yet gather, with the new Jewish nation in the lead, the church  closest to the person of the king, and all men drawn. Jesus is God's  organizer of the social fabric of the world. In response to His presence  and touch, each in his own place will swing into line and make up a  perfect social fabric.    With the new zeal for pure, holy living now in the church, the clearer  vision coming to her of the Lord's purpose of evangelizing the world, the  evidence in all parts of the world of men turning their thought anew to  God, this remarkable Jewish movement toward national life, it is a time  for earnest men to get off alone on bent knees, and with new, quietly deep  fervor, to pray \"Thy kingdom come.\" \"Even so come, Lord Jesus.\"          II. The Person of Jesus          1. The Human Jesus.    2. The Divine Jesus.    3. The Winsome Jesus.          The Human Jesus        <u>God's Meaning of \"Human.\"</u>      Jesus is God becoming man's fellow. He comes down by his side and says,  \"Let's pull up together.\" Jesus was a man. He was as truly human as though  only human. We are apt to go at a thing from the outside. God always  reaches _within_, and fastens His hook there. He finds the solution of  every problem within itself. When He would lead man back the Eden road to  the old trysting place under the tree of life He sent a man. Jesus takes  His place as a man and refuses to be budged from the human level with His  brothers.    That word human has come to have two meanings. The first true meaning, and  a second, that has grown up through sin, and sin's taint and trail. The  second has become the common popular meaning; the first, the forgotten  meaning. It will help us live up to our true possible selves to mark  keenly the distinction. The first is God's meaning, the true. The second  is sin's, the hurt meaning. Constantly we read the effect and result of  sin into God's thought as though that were the real thing. This is grained  in deep, woven into the adages of the race. For instance, \"To err is  human, to forgive divine.\" Yet this catchy statement is not true, save in  part. To forgive is human--God's human--as well as divine. Not to forgive  is devilish. It is not human to err. It is possible to the human being to  err, as it is with angels, but, in erring, man is leaving the human level  and going lower down.    To understand what it means to say that Jesus is human we must recall what  human meant originally, and has properly come to mean. Man as made by God  before the hurt of sin came had certain powers and limitations. His  powers, briefly, were, mastery of his body, of his mental faculties, and  powers in the spirit realm so lost to us now that we cannot even say  definitely what they are. And mastery means poised, mature control, not  misuse, nor abuse, nor lack of use, but full proper use. Possibly there  were powers of communication between men in addition to speech unknown to  us. Then, too, he had dominion over nature, over all the animal creation,  over all the forces of nature, and not only dominion, but fellowship with  the animal creation and with the forces of nature: dominion _through_  fellowship.    He had certain limitations. Having a body was a limitation. The necessity  for food, sleep, rest, and for exertion in order to move through space  acted as a constant check upon his movements and achievements. He could  not go into a building except through some opening. The law of growth, of  such infinite value to man under his conditions, was likewise a check.  Only by slow laborious effort and application would there come the  discipline of mental powers and the knowledge necessary to life's work.        <u>The Hurt of Sin.</u>      Now, in addition to these natural limitations sin has made other changes.  It has lessened the powers and increased the limitations. There has been  immense loss in the power over the forces of nature, though now, by slow  and very laborious efforts, after centuries, much is being regained.  Instead of fellowship there has been an estrangement between man and the  lower animals and between man and the forces of nature. All of this has  immensely added to man's limitations, though it is true that most men do  not know of what has been lost, so complete has the loss been.    The natural limitations have been added to. Sin affects the judgment. It  brings ignorance and passion, and they affect the judgment. There results  lack of care of the body, improper use of the strength, and ignorant and  improper use of the bodily functions. Then come weakness and disease and  shortened life, not to speak of the misery included in these and the  enjoyment missed. In the chain of results comes the toil that is drudgery.  Not work, but excessive work, more than one should do, with less strength  than one should have. Work itself under natural conditions is always a  delight. But through sin has come strain, tugging, friction, unequal  division. The changes wrought in nature by sin call for greater effort  with less return. Toil becomes slavish and grinding. Then poverty adds its  tug. And sorrow comes to sap the strength and take away the buoyancy. And  then man's inhumanity to his brothers and sisters. These are some of the  limitations added by sin and ever increasing.        <u>Our Fellow.</u>      Now, Jesus was human; truly naturally human, God's human, and then more  because of the conditions He found. The love act of creation brought with  it self-imposed limitations to God. And now the love act of saving brings  still more. God made man in His own image. In His humanity Jesus was in  the image of God, even as we are. Adam was an unfallen man. Jesus was that  and more, a tested and now matured unfallen man, and by the law of growth  ever growing more. Adam was an innocent, unfallen man up to the  temptation. Jesus was a virtuous unfallen man. The test with Him changed  innocence to virtue.    In His experiences, His works, His temptations, His struggles, His  victories, Jesus was clearly human. In His ability to read men's thoughts  and know their lives without finding out by ordinary means, His knowledge  ahead of coming events, His knowledge of and control over nature, He  clearly was more than the human _we_ know. Yet until we know more than we  seem to now of the proper powers of an unfallen man matured and growing  in the use and control of those powers we cannot draw here any line  between human and divine. But the whole presumption is in favor of  believing that in all of this Jesus was simply exercising the proper human  powers which with Him were not hurt by sin but ever increasing in use.    Jesus insisted on living a simple true human life, dependent upon God and  upon others. He struck the key-note of this at the start in the  wilderness. Everything He taught He put through the test of use. He _was_  what He taught. As a man He has gone through all He calls us to. He blazed  the way into every thicket and woods, and then stands ahead, softly,  clearly calling, \"Come along _after_ Me.\"    He was a normal man, God's pattern unchanged. All the powers of body and  mind and spirit were developed naturally and _held in poise_, no lack of  development, no over development of some part, no misuse of any power, nor  abuse, but each part perfectly fitting in and working naturally with each  other part.    He experienced all the proper limitations of human life. He needed food  and sleep and rest and needed to give His body proper thought and care. He  was under the human limitations regarding space and material construction.  He got from one place to another by the slow process of using His strength  or joining it with nature or that of a beast. He entered a building  through an opening as we do. Both of these are in sharp contrast with the  conditions after the resurrection. His stock of knowledge came by the law  of increase, the natural way; some, and then more, and the more gaining  more yet.    But there's more than this. There's a bit of a pull inside as one thinks  of this, as though Jesus in His _humanity_ after all is on a level above  us, hardly alongside giving us a hand. Ah! there is more. He had  fellowship with us in the limitation that sin has brought. He shared the  experiences that men were actually having. He knew the bitterness of  having one's life plan utterly broken and something else--a rude jagged  something else--thrust in its place. But the bitterness of the experience  never got into His spirit or affected His conduct. The emergency He found  down here wrought by sin affected Him.    He was _hungry_ sometimes without food at hand to satisfy His hunger. He  always showed a peculiar tender sympathy with hungry people. He couldn't  bear the sight of the hungry crowds without food.

In their  haste, they had forgotten to untie the rope which was around the  trunk of the caramay tree. As the horse pulled at the rope fruit fell  from the tree upon the old man and woman. Believing they were shot,  they were so frightened that they died. [150]        The Presidente who had Horns    _Ilocano_      Once there was a presidente [151] who was very unjust  to his people,  and one day he became so angry that he wished he had horns so that  he might frighten them. No sooner had he made this rash wish, than  horns began to grow on his head.    He sent for a barber who came to his house to cut his hair, and as  he worked the presidente asked:    \"What do you see on my head?\"    \"I see nothing,\" answered the barber; for although he could see the  horns plainly, he was afraid to say so.    Soon, however, the presidente put up his hands and felt the horns, and  then when he inquired again the barber told him that he had two horns.    \"If you tell anyone what you have seen, you shall be hanged,\" said the  presidente as the barber started away, and he was greatly frightened.    When he reached home, the barber did not intend to tell anyone, for  he was afraid; but as he thought of his secret more and more, the  desire to tell someone became so strong that he knew he could not keep  it. Finally he went to the field and dug a hole under some bamboo,  and when the hole was large enough he crawled in and whispered that  the presidente had horns. He then climbed out, filled up the hole,  and went home.    By and by some people came along the road on their way to market,  and as they passed the bamboo they stopped in amazement, for surely  a voice came from the trees, and it said that the presidente had  horns. These people hastened to market and told what they had heard,  and the people there went to the bamboo to listen to the strange  voice. They informed others, and soon the news had spread all over the  town. The councilmen were told, and they, too, went to the bamboo. When  they had heard the voice, they ran to the house of the presidente. But  his wife said that he was ill and they could not see him.    By this time the horns had grown until they were one foot in length,  and the presidente was so ashamed that he bade his wife tell the  people that he could not talk. She told this to the councilmen when  they came on the following day, but they replied that they must see  him, for they had heard that he had horns, and if this were true he  had no right to govern the people.    She refused to let them in, so they broke down the door. They saw the  horns on the head of the presidente and killed him. For, they said,  he was no better than an animal. [152]        The Story of a Monkey    _Ilocano_      One day when a monkey was climbing a tree in the forest in which he  lived, he ran a thorn into his tail. Try as he would, he could not  get it out, so he went to a barber in the town and said:    \"Friend Barber, I have a thorn in the end of my tail. Pull it out,  and I will pay you well.\"    The barber tried to pull out the thorn with his razor, but in doing  so he cut off the end of the tail. The monkey was very angry and cried:    \"Barber, Barber, give me back my tail, or give me your razor!\"    The barber could not put back the end of the monkey's tail, so he  gave him his razor.    On the way home the monkey met an old woman who was cutting wood for  fuel, and he said to her:    \"Grandmother, Grandmother, that is very hard. Use this razor and then  it will cut easily.\"    The old woman was very pleased with the offer and began to cut with the  razor, but before she had used it long it broke. Then the monkey cried:    \"Grandmother, Grandmother, you have broken my razor! You must get a  new one for me or else give me all the firewood.\"    The old woman could not get a new razor so she gave him the firewood.    The monkey took the wood and was going back to town to sell it,  when he saw a woman sitting beside the road making cakes.    \"Grandmother, Grandmother,\" said he, \"your wood is most gone; take  this of mine and bake more cakes.\"    The woman took the wood and thanked him for his kindness, but when  the last stick was burned, the monkey cried out:    \"Grandmother, Grandmother, you have burned up all my wood! Now you  must give me all your cakes to pay for it.\"    The old woman could not cut more dry wood at once, so she gave him  all the cakes.    The monkey took the cakes and started for the town, but on the way he  met a dog which bit him so that he died. And the dog ate all the cakes.        The White Squash    _Ilocano_    In a queer little bamboo house in front of a big garden lived a man  and his wife all alone. They had always been kind and good to everyone,  but still they were not happy, because the child for which they longed  had never come to them. Each day for many years they had prayed for  a son or a daughter, but their prayers had been unanswered. Now that  they were growing old they believed that they must always live alone.    In the garden near their house this couple grew fine white squash,  and as the vines bore the year around, they had never been in need  of food. One day, however, they discovered that no new squash had  formed to take the place of those they had picked, and for the first  time in many seasons they had no vegetables.    Each day they examined the vines, and though the big, yellow flowers  continued to bloom and fade, no squash grew on the stems. Finally,  one morning after a long wait, the woman cried out with delight, for  she had discovered a little green squash. After examining it, they  decided to let it ripen that they might have the seeds to plant. They  eagerly watched it grow, and it became a beautiful white vegetable,  but by the time it was large enough for food they were so hungry that  they decided to eat it.    They brought a large knife and picked it, but scarcely had they  started to open it when a voice cried out from within, \"Please be  careful that you do not hurt me.\"    The man and woman stopped their work, for they thought that a spirit  must have spoken to them. But when the voice again called and begged  them to open the squash, they carefully opened it, and there inside  was a nice baby boy. [153] He could already stand alone and could  talk. And the man and his wife were overjoyed.    Presently the woman went to the spring for a jar of water, and  when she had brought it she spread a mat on the floor and began to  bathe the baby. As the drops of water fell off his body, they were  immediately changed to gold, so that when the bath was finished gold  pieces covered the mat. The couple had been so delighted to have the  baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but  now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever.    The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again  the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large  house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he  grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared  also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.        The Creation Story    _Tagalog_      When the world first began there was no land, but only the stea and  the sky, and between them was a kite. [154] One day the bird which  had nowhere to light grew tired of flying about, so she stirred up  the sea until it threw its waters against the sky. The sky, in order  to restrain the sea, showered upon it many islands until it could no  longer rise, but ran back and forth. Then the sky ordered the kite  to light on one of the islands to build her nest, and to leave the  sea and the sky in peace.    Now at this time the land breeze and the sea breeze were married,  and they had a child which was a bamboo. One day when this bamboo was  floating about on the water, it struck the feet of the kite which  was on the beach. The bird, angry that anything should strike it,  pecked at the bamboo, and out of one section came a man and from the  other a woman.    Then the earthquake called on all the birds and fish to see what  should be done with these two, and it was decided that they should  marry. Many children were born to the couple, and from them came all  the different races of people.    After a while the parents grew very tired of having so many idle and  useless children around, and they wished to be rid of them, but they  knew of no place to send them to. Time went on and the children became  so numerous that the parents enjoyed no peace. One day, in desperation,  the father seized a stick and began beating them on all sides.    This so frightened the children that they fled in different directions,  seeking hidden rooms in the house--some concealed themselves in  the walls, some ran outside, while others hid in the fireplace,  and several fled to the sea.    Now it happened that those who went into the hidden rooms of the  house later became the chiefs of the Islands; and those who concealed  themselves in the walls became slaves. Those who ran outside were free  men; and those who hid in the fireplace became negroes; while those  who fled to the sea were gone many years, and when their children  came back they were the white people.

They were very poor, and as the boy grew older and  saw how hard his parents struggled for their scanty living he often  dreamed of a time when he might be a help to them.
