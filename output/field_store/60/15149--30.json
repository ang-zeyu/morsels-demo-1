Society reserved quite a touching deference  for the opinions of Mr. Punch. It gives us some idea of the position  into which the paper had worked itself a generation ago when we find  Ruskin, the greatest social critic of his day, going straight to it for  an authoritative picture of the time. People have not sufficiently  remembered how often when they have referred to _Punch_ they were really  referring to du Maurier, or what is left now of his tradition--his way  of dealing with the foibles of society. The position of the paper in  Society was won by appositeness of political criticism, and the delicate  edge of its satire. It was du Maurier who put that edge on. Society  returned fascinated after every wound to inspect the weapon. Keene's pen  brought immense artistic prestige to _Punch_, but its social prestige it  owes to du Maurier more than to anyone; we only become aware that Leech  had begun a tradition in its pages by its supreme fulfilment in du  Maurier's art.      Section 9    Henry Silver, a member of the _Punch_ staff, who came to the table in  1858, kept a diary of the talk of the table until he retired in 1870.  The present writer was the more touched by the honour of being permitted  to look into this interesting document from the fact that the pen of the  exquisite E.V. Lucas has but lately inspired itself at the same source.  This was for a paper of Thackerayana which concluded, after reference to  the death of Leech, Thackeray's friend: \"On November 7th (1864) Leech's  successor, George du Maurier, took his seat at the Table, and so the  world goes on.\"    Thackeray bulks more largely in the diary than even du Maurier, for du  Maurier's genius in the table conversation was wholly for asides. We  have already mentioned his comparative lack of interest in the debates  over the large cartoon. And this Silver himself draws attention to: \"Du  M. and H.S. generally mute when the 'L.C.' is discussed.\" The  conversation at each meeting is for some time closely confined to the  discussion of the cartoon, then it spreads to every imaginable topic.  One feels that one assists at the making of history when the Great  Cartoon, or Cut, as they called it, is discussed--as, for instance, when  the design for the one representing Disraeli on the side of the Angels  is decided upon, after his famous speech at Oxford in 1864. The  desultory conversation reported in the diary on each occasion after  settlement of the cartoon throws a light upon things uppermost in the  public mind at the time. It is noted when the Queen comes out of  retirement into the world again. And a vivid reflection is to be found  of the horror felt at the news of the assassination of Lincoln. Men as  closely united as the _Punch_ staff have prejudices as clearly defined  as those of an individual. There was great hostility to the Swinburne of  the sixties. Du Maurier on one occasion sticks up for Swinburne as \"the  writer of lovely verses--the weaver of words--the rhymer of rhymes.\" \"Du  M. and H.S. agree in thinking Tennyson will live 'chiefly by his songs  and minor lays.'\"    [Illustration: George du Maurier    From a photograph.]    \"Du M. thinks _Vanity Fair_ a little Bible,\" \"Rather an epistle by the  Corinthians,\" says Shirley Brooks.    One night after dinner du Maurier walked home in the wet. \"My carriage  is waiting for Silver,\" he said. \"My carriage is waiting for gold,\"  answered Shirley Brooks.    Sometimes the discourse at the table is of Religion. \"Du M. believes in  God, and that whatever we do God will not punish us.\"    \"A comfortable faith,\" adds Silver.    Once the discussion turned upon suicide. \"Du M. says before he married  he often felt tempted to suicide.\"    In heading his diary shortly after du Maurier joined the table, Silver  writes \"Du M.\" and then corrects it \"(no: DU M.).\" And in another place  he writes, \"Du Maurier says fellows write to him de Maurier: 'give the  devil his du.'\"    In 1865 the proprietors, getting old, have put their sons in their  stead, and taken the Agnews into partnership. The staff talk  sentimentally of old times. They drink success to the Firm. Mark Lemon,  the Editor, proposes the health of Bradbury & Evans, saying, \"men work  well together because they are liberally treated. Thought our loss last  year (death of Leech) would have seriously affected _Punch_, but it did  not. And no single loss will.\" Bradbury, replying, speaks of the  brotherly affection between the editor and the proprietors. \"Says if you  want men to serve you well treat them well, and win their sympathy and  esteem.... Evans is emphatic on the Brotherhood of the Punch table.\"  Thackeray's \"Mahogany Tree\" is sung; du Maurier sings a French song, and  F.C.B. also singeth a song with no words to speak of, &c. &c. &c. \"So we  pass a jolly evening, and bear in mind--that Sociality is the secret of  the success of _Punch_.\"    On another occasion there is the paper's \"Silver Wedding.\" A watch and  chain with eleven links--the mystic number of the _Punch_ staff--is  handed over to Mark Lemon. In the morning he has received a letter with  a hundred guineas. He claims, in replying, \"that the _Punch_ Brotherhood  is one of the most extraordinary literary brotherhoods the world has  seen.\"    Shirley Brooks hands him letters written by the staff individually,  testifying their gladness at the gift proposed. Du Maurier wrote the  longest and Charles Keene the shortest.    We have extracted the following items from the diary, quoting exactly,  except for the substitution sometimes of the full name for initials:         _November 7th_--_Monday_. \"S.B., du Maurier (his debut), H.S.,       J.T., M.L., P.L., F.C.B., H.M., T.T.         \"(The initials stand for Shirley Brooks, Henry Silver, John       Tenniel, Mark Lemon, Professor Leigh, F.C. Burnand, Horace Mayhew,       Tom Taylor.)         \"Du Maurier tells of Whistler and Rossetti's rage for old china,       and how Rossetti once left his guests at dinner and rushed off to       buy a piece before Whistler could forestall him.\"         _May_ 17, 1865. \"Du Maurier was presented with a son and heir on       Saturday, so we baptized the infant in a bumper of Champagne.\"         _December_ 20, 1865. \"While the Great Cut is being hatched,       Burnand, du Maurier, and Silver all make little cuts of their       initials on the _Punch_ table. Henry Silver between William       Thackeray and John Leech--Burnand where a Beckett sat and du       Maurier where Leech.\"         \"Miss Bateman retired from the stage (at Her Majesty's) on       Friday--she has rather proved herself a one-part actress, and so       has Sothern, whom Burnand denounces as a practical joker--most       unscrupulous in tongue.\"         \"Du M. thinks it harder to write a poem than to paint a picture.       But surely there's no comparing them. One mind expresses itself       with a pen and another with a brush.\"         _Jan_. 17, 1866. \"Du Maurier tells of the gas blow-up at his 91       Great Russell Street on Boxing-day. Girl dressing in the shop for       Hairdressers' Ball--turned on two burners and lit one and left it       burning. Du Maurier and wife dressing on top floor--bang! like a       hundred pounder, and then rattle--smash--crash. 'O! the children!'       'D--n it! They're all right!' first time he ever swore before his       wife. Sister tried to jump from window, but Armstrong held her       back. Baby crowing in his arms at the fun as he came downstairs.       The nursemaids had run away of course. Lucky no one on the stairs,       or they'd have been killed.\"         _April_ 4, 1866. \"In reference to a Ball on the Haymarket       stage--'Would you like to go?' said S.B. to du Maurier. But du       Maurier's dancing days are over--only cares for dinners now! Fancy       the old fogydom of thirty!\"         _November_ 7, 1868. \"Du Maurier cut down to five cigarettes a day,       resolves to ride daily and live frugally: frightened by his eye       this summer!!\"         _February_ 24, 1868. \"Tenniel has almost given up smoking! Used to       smoke an ounce a day. Can eat a better breakfast now. Nearly all       our _Punch_ folk smoke less. Tom Taylor has given up cigars and       only takes a pipe occasionally. Du Maurier takes cigarettes four a       day in lieu of forty. H.S. never smokes at all after dinner. Only       Keene and Mark and Shirley stick to their tobacco.\"      Section 10    Sir Francis Burnand, till recently the distinguished Editor of _Punch_,  was du Maurier's senior on the paper by a year or two. He has very  kindly sent the writer the following impression of the artist: \"That he  was beloved as a cheery, witty _confrere_, goes without saying. Rarely  did he mix himself up with politics in any shape or form. I doubt if he  ever gave us any assistance in devising a political cartoon. What his  politics were I am unable to say, and I do not think he troubled himself  about the matter. In 'the old days' he delighted in chaffing Horace  Mayhew, with whom he exchanged 'slang' in French. With the jovial  proprietor, William Bradbury, he was always on the best of terms of  friendly nonsense, being invariably his left-hand neighbour at 'The  Table.' He was a genuine Bohemian of the artistic fraternity (as given  in his _Trilby_) with the true polish of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#20)"],[1,"on,  which is sometimes painted, sometimes sculptured, is always the same. Each  wall was a house stocked with the objects depicted or catalogued upon its  surface, and each was, therefore, carefully provided with a fictitious  door, through which the Double had access to his goods. On the left wall he  found a pile of provisions (fig. 135)[29] and a table of offerings; on the  end wall a store of household utensils, as well as a supply of linen and  perfumes, the name and quantity of each being duly registered. These  paintings more briefly sum up the scenes depicted in the chapels of  ordinary mastabas. Transferred from their original position to the walls of  an underground cellar, they were the more surely guaranteed against such  possible destruction as might befall them in chambers open to all comers;  while upon their preservation depended the length of time during which the  dead man would retain possession of the property which they represented.

[For the following translation of this section of Professor Maspero's book  I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W.M. Flinders Petrie, whose work on  _The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh_, published with the assistance of a  grant from the Royal Society in 1883, constitutes our standard authority on  the construction of these Pyramids.--A.B.E.]    The royal tombs have the form of pyramids with a square base, and are the  equivalent in stone or brick of the tumulus of heaped earth which was piled  over the body of the warrior chief in prehistoric times (Note 14). The same  ideas prevailed as to the souls of kings as about those of private men; the  plan of the pyramid consists, therefore, of three parts, like the mastaba,  --the chapel, the passage, and the sepulchral vault.    The chapel is always separate. At Sakkarah no trace of it has been found;  it was probably, as later on at Thebes, in a quarter nearer to the town. At  Medum, Gizeh, Abusir, and Dahshur, these temples stood at the east or north  fronts of the pyramids. They were true temples, with chambers, courts, and  passages. The fragments of bas-reliefs hitherto found show scenes of  sacrifice, and prove that the decoration was the same as in the public  halls of the mastabas. The pyramid, properly speaking, contained only the  passages and sepulchral vault. The oldest of which the texts show the  existence, north of Abydos, is that of Sneferu; the latest belong to the  princes of the Twelfth Dynasty. The construction of these monuments was,  therefore, a continuous work, lasting for thirteen or fourteen centuries,  under government direction. Granite, alabaster, and basalt for the  sarcophagus and some details were the only materials of which the use and  the quantity was not regulated in advance, and which had to be brought from  a distance. To obtain them, each king sent one of the great men of his  court on a mission to the quarries of Upper Egypt; and the quickness with  which the blocks were brought back was a strong claim upon the sovereign's  favour. The other material was not so costly. If mainly brick, the bricks  were moulded on the spot with earth taken from the foot of the hill. If of  stone, the nearest parts of the plateau provided the common marly limestone  in abundance (Note 15). The fine limestone of Turah was usually reserved  for the chambers and the casing, and this might be had without even sending  specially for it to the opposite side of the Nile; for at Memphis there  were stores always full, upon which they continually drew for public  buildings, and, therefore, also for the royal tombs. The blocks being taken  from these stores, and borne by boats to close below the hill, were raised  to their required places along gently sloping causeways. The internal  arrangement of the pyramids, the lengths of the passages and their heights,  were very variable; the pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) rose to 475 feet above  the ground, the smallest was not 30 feet high. The difficulty of imagining  now what motives determined the Pharaohs to choose such different  proportions has led some to think that the mass built was in direct  proportion to the time occupied in building; that is to say, to the length  of each reign. Thus it was supposed that the king would begin by hastily  erecting a pyramid large enough to contain the essential parts of a tomb;  and then, year by year, would add fresh layers around the first core, until  the time when his death for ever arrested the growth of the monument. But  the facts do not justify this hypothesis. The smallest of the pyramids of  Sakkarah is that of Unas, who reigned thirty years; while the two imposing  pyramids of Gizeh were raised by Khufu and Khafra (Chephren), who governed  Egypt, the one for twenty-four, and the other for twenty-three years.  Merenra, who died very young, had a pyramid as large as that of Pepi II.,  whose reign lasted more than ninety years (Note 16). The plan of each  pyramid was laid down, once for all, by the architect, according to the  instructions which he had received, and the resources placed at his  disposal. He then followed it out to the end of the work, without  increasing or reducing the scale (Note 17).    [Illustration: Fig. 136.--Section of the Great Pyramid.[30]]    The pyramids were supposed to have their four faces to the four cardinal  points, like the mastabas; but, either from bad management or neglect, the  greater part are not oriented exactly, and many vary distinctly from the  true north (Note 18). Without speaking of the ruins of Abu Roash or Zowyet  el Aryan, which have not been studied closely enough, they naturally form  six groups, distributed from north to south on the border of the Libyan  plateau, from Gizeh to the Fayum, by Abusir, Sakkarah, Dahshur, and Lisht.  The Gizeh group contains nine, including those of Khufu, Khafra, and  Menkara, which were anciently reckoned among the wonders of the world. The  ground on which the pyramid of Khufu stands was very irregular at the time  of construction. A small rocky height which rose above the surface was  roughly cut (fig. 136) and enclosed in the masonry, the rest being smoothed  and covered with large slabs, some of which still remain (Note 19). The  pyramid itself was 481 feet high and 755 feet wide, dimensions which the  injuries of time have reduced to 454 feet and 750 feet respectively. It  preserved, until the Arab conquest, a casing of stones of different colours  (Note 20), so skilfully joined as to appear like one block from base to  summit. The casing work was begun from the top, and the cap placed on  first, the steps being covered one after the other, until they reached the  bottom (Note 21). In the inside all was arranged so as to hide the exact  place of the sarcophagus, and to baffle any spoilers whom chance or  perseverance had led aright. The first point was to discover the entrance  under the casing, which masked it. It was nearly in the middle of the north  face (fig. 136), but at the level of the eighteenth course, at about forty-  five feet from the ground. When the block which closed it was displaced, an  inclined passage, 41.2 inches wide and 47.6 inches high, was revealed, the  lower part of which was cut in the rock. This descended for 317 feet,  passed through an unfinished chamber, and ended sixty feet farther in a  blind passage. This would be a first disappointment to the spoilers. If,  however, they were not discouraged, but examined the passage with care,  they would find in the roof, sixty-two feet distant from the door, a block  of granite (Note 22) among the surrounding limestone. It was so hard that  the seekers, after having vainly tried to break or remove it, took the  course of forcing a way through the softer stone around (Note 23). This  obstacle past, they came into an ascending passage which joins the first at  an angle of 120 deg. (Note 24), and is divided into two branches. One branch  runs horizontally into the centre of the pyramid, and ends in a limestone  chamber with pointed roof, which is called, without any good reason, \"The  Queen's Chamber.\" The other, continuing upward, changes its form and  appearance. It becomes a gallery 148 feet long and 28 feet high, built of  Mokattam stone, so polished and finely wrought that it is difficult to put  a \"needle or even a hair\" into the joints (Note 25). The lower courses are  vertical; the seven others \"corbel\" forwards, until at the roof they are  only twenty-one inches apart. A fresh obstacle arose at the end of this  gallery. The passage which led to the chamber of the sarcophagus was closed  by a slab of granite (Note 26); farther on was a small vestibule divided in  equal spaces by four portcullises of granite (Note 27), which would need to  be broken. The royal sepulchre is a granite chamber with a flat roof,  nineteen feet high, thirty-four feet long, and seventeen feet wide. Here  are neither figures nor inscriptions; nothing but a granite sarcophagus,  lidless and mutilated. Such were the precautions taken against invaders;  and the result showed that they were effectual, for the pyramid guarded its  deposit during more than four thousand years (Note 28). But the very weight  of the materials was a more serious danger. To prevent the sepulchral  chamber from being crushed by the three hundred feet of stone which stood  over it, five low hollow spaces,"]]]
