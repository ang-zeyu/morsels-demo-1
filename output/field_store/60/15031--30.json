Mr. Gime recommends the use of the Latimer-Clark elements. Every one knows  that the Latimer-Clark element is now the best standard of electromotive  force; but let us not forget that this is on condition of its being  employed in open circuit. Now, it is not a question here of an open  circuit, nor even of infinitely weak currents, since in the line we have a  solenoid whose core must set in motion a whole system of connected pieces.  We do not see any possibility of employing Latimer-Clark elements; on the  contrary, it seems to us indispensable to select piles of large discharge,  since the solenoid, S, will attract nothing at all unless a notable  quantity of energy is expended in it.    Is there a pile of this kind so constant as not to render a rigorously  accurate adjustment illusory? Therein lies the entire question, and for our  part we hesitate to pronounce ourselves in the negative.--_La Lumiere  Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *          A CLINICAL LESSON AT \"LA SALPETRIERE.\"      [Illustration: THE SALON OF 1887.--A LECTURE IN THE DISPENSARY AT LA  SALPETRIERE.--Painted by M. Andre Brouillet.--M. Dochy. Engraver.]    [Illustration: A CLINICAL LECTURE AT \"LA SALPETRIERE.\"]    We reproduce the picture of Mr. Andre Brouillet, which was in the Salon of  1887; and that the subject may be better understood, we give the  accompanying sketch and description. This picture is very interesting, not  only from an artistic point of view, but also as a representation of  students and spectators of all ages admirably grouped around a great master  of science when most interested in his work. We borrow from _Matin-Salon_  Mr. Goetschy's explanation of the picture:    \"The hall in which the lesson is given is lighted by two large windows  opening on one of the courts of the hospital. The Professor stands at the  right of the picture, his head uncovered, one hand close to his body and  the other extended slightly in a gesture which is familiar to him, his  audience being before him. At his side is Mr. Babinski, chief of the  clinic, supporting a person afflicted with hysteria. Near the latter stands  a nurse and assistant who watches every movement of the patient. This is  Mother Bottard, a good, intelligent, and devoted woman, who is well known  to all those present.    \"The auditors have arranged themselves at the students' tables, some seated  on the chairs and stools which furnish the room, and others standing, but  all following closely the teaching of the master, and at the same time  watching the _subject_. The picture is full of life and motion, and yet is  very exact. The head and shoulders of the subject are beautifully and  correctly drawn. The artist has brought together many men who are well  known in literature and science.\"--_Le Monde Illustre_.           *       *       *       *       *    [NATURE.]          TO FIND THE DAY OF THE WEEK FOR ANY GIVEN DATE.      Having hit upon the following method of mentally computing the day of the  week for any given date, I send it you in the hope that it may interest  some of your readers. I am not a rapid computer myself, and as I find my  average time for doing any such question is about 20 seconds, I have little  doubt that a rapid computer would not need 15.    Take the given date in 4 portions, viz., the number of centuries, the  number of years over, the month, the day of the month.    Compute the following 4 items, adding each, when found, to the total of the  previous items. When an item or total exceeds 7, divide by 7, and keep the  remainder only.    _The Century Item_.--For old style (which ended September 2, 1752) subtract  from 18. For new style (which began September 14) divide by 4, take  overplus from 3, multiply remainder by 2.    _The Year Item_.--Add together the number of dozens, the overplus, and the  number of 4's in the overplus.    _The Month Item_.--If it begins or ends with a vowel, subtract the number  denoting its place in the year from 10. This, plus its number of days,  gives the item for the following month. The item for January is \"0;\" for  February or March (the 3d month), \"3;\" for December (the 12th month), \"12.\"    _The Day Item_ is the day of the month.    The total thus reached must be corrected by deducting \"1\" (first adding 7,  if the total be \"0\"), if the date be January or February in a leap year;  remembering that every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, excepting only  the century years, in new style, when the number of centuries is _not_ so  divisible (e.g., 1800).    The final result gives the day of the week, \"0\" meaning Sunday, \"1\" Monday,  and so on.    EXAMPLES.    1783, _September_ 18.    17 divided by 4 leaves \"1\" over; 1 from 3 gives \"2;\" twice 2 is \"4.\"    83 is 6 dozen and 11, giving 17; plus 2 gives 19, i.e. (dividing by 7),  \"5.\" Total 9, i.e., \"2.\"    The item for August is \"8 from 10,\" i.e., \"2;\" so, for September, it is \"2  plus 3,\" i.e., \"5.\" Total 7, i.e., \"0,\" which goes out.    18 gives \"4.\" Answer, \"_Thursday_.\"    1676, _February_ 23.    16 from 18 gives \"2.\"    76 is 6 dozen and 4, giving 10; plus 1 gives 11, i.e., \"4.\" Total \"6.\"    The item for February is \"3.\" Total 9, i.e., \"2.\"    23 gives \"2.\" Total \"4.\"    Correction for leap year gives \"3.\" Answer, \"_Wednesday_.\"    LEWIS CARROLL.           *       *       *       *       *          PRECIOUS STONES OF THE UNITED STATES.      To the recently distributed government report on the mineral resources of  the United States for 1885.[1] Mr. G.F. Kunz contributes an interesting  chapter in which is recorded the progress made during that year in the  discovery and utilization of precious stones.    [Footnote 1: Mineral Resources of the United States: Calendar Year 1885.  Washington: Government Printing Office. 1888.]    In the summer of 1885, a remarkably large pocket containing fine crystals  of muscovite, with brilliant crystals of rutile implanted on them, was  found at the Emerald and Hiddenite Mining Company's works, at Stony Point,  N.C., and was sold in the form of cabinet specimens for $750. While the  soil overlying the rock was being worked, nine crystals of emerald were  found, all of which were doubly terminated, and measured from 1 inch to  3-1/8 inches in length and 1-2/3 inch in width. One of these crystals is  very perfect as a specimen, being of a fine light green color, and weighing  83/4 ounces. It is held by the company at $1,500, and the nine crystals  together at $3,000. Another of these crystals, doubly terminated, measures  21/2 inches by 11/12 of an inch, and is filled with large rhombohedral  cavities, which formerly contained dolomite. The only crystal from this  collection that has been cut into a gem was found in a pocket at a depth of  over 43 feet. In color it is of a pleasing light green, and it weighs  4-22/32 carats. No crystal of a finer color has as yet been found in the  United States, and the gem is held by the company at $200.    During the recent mining, the largest fine crystal of lithia emerald ever  found was also brought to light. It measures 23/4 inches by 3/5 of an inch  by 1/3 of an inch. One end is of a very fine color, and would afford the  largest gem of this mineral yet found, and one which would probably weigh  51/2 carats. With this there was a number of superior crystals and some  ounces of common pieces of the same mineral. The company estimates the  value of this entire yield of hiddenite at about $2,500.    There was also found a quantity of quartz filled with white byssolite,  forming very attractive specimens and valued at $250.    A number of beryls of a fine blue color, resembling the Mourne Mountain  specimens, were found near Mount Antero, Chaffee County, Col. One of these  was 4 inches long and 3/8 of an inch across, with cutting material in it.  The other crystals measured from 1 to 11/4 inch in length, and from 1/5 to  1/3 inch in width.    The large beryl mentioned by Mr. Kunz in the Mineral Resources for 1883 and  1884 has afforded the finest aquamarine of American origin known. It is  brilliant as a cut gem, and, with the exception of a few internal hair-like  striae, is absolutely perfect. It weighs 1333/4 carats, measures 1-2/5 x 1-2/5  x 4/5 inch, and is of a deep bluish green, equal to that of gems from any  known locality.    Mr. G.F. Breed, manager of the Valencia Mica Company, has cut nearly one  hundred aquamarines, ranging from 1/2 carat to 4 carats in weight, and of a  light blue color, from white beryls found in the company's mica mine at  North Grafton, N.H.    A number of fine, deep golden-yellow, blue, and green beryls, equaling any  ever found, have been taken by Mr. M.W. Barse from his mica mine between  New Milford and Litchfield, Conn. Some fine blood-red garnets from this  same locality have been cut into gems.    The largest phenacite crystal ever found is owned by Mr. Whitman Cross. It  was discovered at Crystal Park, Col., weighs 59 pennyweights 6 grains, and  measures 1-4/5 inch in length and 1-1/5 inch in thickness.    Thousands of garnet crystals, found at Ruby Mountain, near Salides, Col.,  have been made into paperweights and sold to tourists. Those that weigh a  few ounces sell for about ten cents each. One was sold that weighed 14  pounds. Apropos of garnets, the discovery, in the heart of New York city,  of as fine a crystal as was ever found on this continent, and weighing 9  pounds 10 ounces, may be mentioned as a matter of peculiar interest.    Several thousand dollars' worth of the wood jasper of Arizona has been cut  into paper weights, charms, and other objects, or polished on one side for  cabinet specimens. Numbers of these articles are now being cut and sold to  tourists along the line of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad.    The compact quartzite of Sioux Falls, Dakota, is being quarried and  polished for ornamental purposes.

I will never  disgrace the position high as it is above my poor deserts. When the day  comes--if the day comes--that you need or feel you need the sustainment  of my presence or the devotion of my heart, no power on earth save that  of death itself, shall keep me from your side. Till that day arrives I  remain what you have made me, a bride who lays no claim to the name  you this morning bestowed upon her.' And with a gesture that was like a  benediction, she turned, and noiselessly, breathlessly as a dream that  vanishes, left the room.    \"Sirs, I believe I uttered a cry and stumbled towards her. Some one in  that room uttered a cry, but it may be that it only rose in my heart and  that the one I heard came from my father's lips. For when at the door  I turned, startled at the deathly silence, I saw he had fainted on his  pillow. I could not leave him so. Calling to Mrs. Daniels, who was never  far from my father in those days, I bade her stop the lady--I believe  I called her my wife--who was going down the stairs, and then rushed to  his side. It took minutes to revive him. When he came to himself it was  to ask for the creature who had flashed like a beacon of light upon his  darkening path. I rose as if to fetch her but before I could advance I  heard a voice say, 'She is not here,' and looking up I saw Mrs. Daniels  glide into the room.    \"'Mrs. Blake has gone, sir, I could not keep her.'\"        CHAPTER XIII. A MAN'S HEART      \"That was the last time my eyes ever rested upon my wife. Whither she  went or what refuge she gained, I never knew. My father who had received  in this scene a great shock, began to fail so rapidly, he demanded my  constant care; and though from time to time as I ministered to him and  noted with what a yearning persistency he would eye the door and then  turn and meet my gaze with a look I could not understand, I caught  myself asking whether I had done a deed destined to hang forever about  me like a pall; it was not till after his death that the despairing  image of the bright young creature to whom I had given my name, returned  with any startling distinctness to my mind, or that I allowed myself to  ask whether the heavy gloom which I now felt settling upon me was owing  to the sense of shame that overpowered me at the remembrance of the  past, or to the possible loss I had sustained in the departure of my  young unloved bride.    \"The announcement at this time of the engagement between Evelyn Blake  and the Count De Mirac may have had something to do with this. Though I  had never in the most passionate hours of my love for her, lost sight of  that side of her nature which demanded as her right the luxury of great  wealth; and though in my tacit abandonment of her and secret marriage  with another I had certainly lost the right to complain of her actions  whatever they might be, this manifest surrendering of herself to the  power of wealth and show at the price of all that women are believed to  hold dear, was an undoubted blow to my pride and the confidence I  had till now unconsciously reposed in her inherent womanliness and  affection. That she had but made on a more conspicuous scale, the same  sacrifice as myself to the god of Wealth and Position, was in my eyes  at that time, no palliation of her conduct. I was a man none too good  or exalted at the best; she, a woman, should have been superior to the  temptations that overpowered me. That she was not, seemed to drag all  womanhood a little nearer the dust; fashionable womanhood I ought to  say, for somehow even at that early day her conduct did not seem to  affect the vivid image of Luttra standing upon my threshold, shorn of  her joy but burning with a devotion I did not comprehend, and saying,    \"'I loved you. Ah, and I do yet, my husband, love you so that I leave  you. When the day comes--if the day comes--you need or feel you need  the sustainment of my presence or the devotion of my heart, no power on  earth save that of death itself, shall keep me from your side.'    \"Yes, with the fading away of other faces and other forms, that face and  that form now began to usurp the chief place in my thoughts. Not to my  relief and pleasure. That could scarcely be, remembering all that had  occurred; rather to my increasing distress and passionate resentment.  I longed to forget I was held by a tie, that known to the world would  cause me the bitterest shame. For by this time the true character of  her father and brother had been revealed and I found myself bound to the  daughter of a convicted criminal.    \"But I could not forget her. The look with which she had left me was  branded into my consciousness. Night and day it floated before me, till  to escape it I resolved to fasten it upon canvas, if by that means I  might succeed in eliminating it from my dreams.    \"The painting you have seen this night is the result. Born with an  artist's touch and insight that under other circumstances might,  perhaps, have raised me into the cold dry atmosphere of fame, the  execution of this piece of work, presented but few difficulties to my  somewhat accustomed hand. Day by day her beauty grew beneath my brush,  startling me often with its spiritual force and significance till my  mind grew feverish over its work, and I could scarcely refrain from  rising at night to give a touch here or there to the floating golden  hair or the piercing, tender eyes turned, ah, ever turned upon the  inmost citadel of my heart with that look that slew my father before his  time and made me, yes me, old in spirit even in the ardent years of my  first manhood.    \"At last it was finished and she stood before me life-like and real in  the very garments and with almost the very aspect of that never to be  forgotten moment. Even the roses which in the secret uneasiness of my  conscience I had put in her hand on our departure from Troy, as a sort  of visible token that I regarded her as my bride, and which through all  her interview with my father she had never dropped, blossomed before  me on the canvas. Nothing that could give reality to the likeness,  was lacking; the vision of my dreams stood embodied in my sight, and I  looked for peace. Alas, that picture now became my dream.    \"Inserting it behind that of Evelyn which for two years had held its  place above my armchair, I turned its face to the wall when I rose in  the morning. But at night it beamed ever upon me, becoming as the months  passed, the one thing to hold to and muse over when the world grew a  little noisy in my ears and the never ceasing conflict of the ages beat  a trifle too loudly on heart and brain.    \"Meanwhile no word of her, only of her villainous father and brother; no  token that she had escaped evil or was removed from want. If I had loved  her I could not have succored her, for I did not know where to find her.  Her countenance illumined my wall, but her fair young self lay for all I  knew sheltered within the darkness and silence of the tomb.    \"At length my morbid broodings worked out their natural result. A dull  melancholy settled upon me which nothing could break. Even the news that  my cousin who had lost her husband a month after marriage, had returned  to America with expectation to remain, scarcely caused a ripple in my  apathy. Was I sinking into a hypochrondriac? or was my passion for the  beautiful brunette dead? I determined to solve the doubt.    \"Seeking her where I knew she would be found, I gazed again upon her  beauty. It was absolutely nothing to me. A fair young face with high  thoughts in every glance floated like sunshine between us and I left the  haughty Countess, with the knowledge burned deep into my brain, that the  love I had considered slain was alive and demanding, but that the object  of it past recall, was my lost young wife.    \"Once assured of this, my apathy vanished like mist before a kindled  torch. Henceforth the future held a hope, and life a purpose. I would  seek my wife throughout the world and bring her back if I found her  in prison between the men whose existence was a curse to my pride. But  where should I turn my steps? What golden thread had she left in my hand  by which to trace her through the labyrinth of this world? I could think  of but one, and that was the love which would restrain her from going  away from me too far. The Luttra of old would not leave the city where  her husband lived. If she was not changed, I ought to be able to find  her somewhere within this great Babylon of ours. Wisdom told me to  set the police upon her track, but pride bade me try every other means  first. So with the feverish energy of one leading a forlorn hope, I  began to pace the streets if haply I might see her face shine upon me  from the crowd of passers by; a foolish fancy, unproductive of result! I  not only failed to see her, but anyone like her.    \"In the midst of the despair occasioned by this failure a thought flashed  across me or rather a remembrance. One night not long since, being  uncommonly restless, I had risen from my bed, dressed me and gone out  into the yard back of my house for a little air. It was an unusual thing  for me to do but I seemed to be suffocating where I was, and nothing  else would satisfy me. As you already surmise, it was the night on which  disappeared the sewing girl of which you have so often spoken, but I  knew nothing of that, my thoughts were far from my own home and its  concerns. You may judge what a state of mind I was in when I tell you  that I even thought at one moment while I paused before the gate leading  into ---- Street that I saw the face of her with whom my thoughts were  ever busy, peering upon me through the bars.    \"You tell me that I did see a girl there, and that it was the one who  had lived as sewing woman in my house; it may be so, but at the time I  considered it a vision of my wife, and the remembrance of it, coming"]]]
