If  the child feels he is not trusted he ceases to make any effort, and  lapse will succeed lapse with increasing frequency.    In efforts at moral training there is often too great an emphasis laid  upon negative virtues. It is wrong to do this: to do that is  forbidden. Children cannot progress by merely avoiding faults any more  than a man may claim to be an agreeable companion at table because he  does not eat peas with a knife or drink with his mouth full. There  must be a constant effort to achieve some positive good, to acquire  knowledge, to do service, to take thought for others, to discipline  self, and the parent will get the best result who is comparatively  blind to failure but quick to encourage effort and to appreciate  success. When the child knows well that he is doing wrong, exhortation  and expostulation are usually of little avail if repeated too often,  and serious talks should only take place at long intervals.    We know how effective the so-called \"therapeutic conversation\" may be  in helping some overwrought and nervously exhausted man or woman to  regain peace of mind and self-control. After an intimate conversation  with a medical man who knows how to draw from the patient a free  expression of the doubts, anxieties, and fears which are obsessing  him, many a patient feels as though he had awakened in that instant  from a nightmare, and passes from the consulting-room to find his  troubles become of little account. Not a few patients return to be  reassured once more, and derive new strength on each occasion. Yet  visits such as these must be infrequent or they will lose their power.  Now, just as the physician is well aware that his intervention if too  frequently repeated will lose its effect, so the parent must be chary  of too frequent an appeal to the moral sense of the child. At long  intervals opportunity may be taken with all seriousness to set before  the child ideals of conduct, to-speak to him of the meaning of  character and of self-discipline, and of the standards by which we  judge a man or woman to be weak and despicable, or strong and to be  admired. The effect of such an intimate conversation, never repeated,  may persist throughout life. Constantly reiterated appeals, on the  other hand, do more harm than good. To tell a child daily that he is  \"breaking mother's heart,\" or that he is \"disappointing his father,\"  is to debase the moral appeal and deprive it of its strength.    For everyday use it is best to cultivate a manner which can indicate  to the child that he is for the moment unpopular, but which at the  same time denies to the small sinner the interest of attempting his  own defence. On the other hand, should the child be reasonably in  doubt as to the nature of his offence we must spare no trouble in  explaining it to him. Punishment will be most effective when the child  is convinced that he is rightly convicted. If it is to act as a real  deterrent, he must agree to be punished--a frame of mind which, if it  can be produced, may be welcomed as a sure sign that training is  proceeding along the right lines.    By physical training, mental training, and moral training the child's  character is formed and self-discipline is developed. With the child  of neuropathic disposition and inheritance matters may not proceed so  smoothly. Reasoning and conduct may be alike faulty, and the nervous  disturbances may even cause detriment to the physical health. Not that  the nervous child requires an environment different from that of the  normal child. The difficulties which the parents will encounter and  the problems which must be solved differ not in kind but in degree. An  error of environment which is without effect in the normal child may  be sufficient to produce disastrous results in the neuropathic.    It must be granted that there are some unfortunate children in whom  the moral sense remains absent and cannot be developed--children who  steal and lie, who seem destitute of natural affection, or who appear  to delight in acts of cruelty. These moral degenerates need not be  considered here. Serious errors of conduct, however, in children who  are not degenerate or imbecile, frequently arise directly from faults  of management and can be controlled by correcting these faults.  Suppose, for example, that a child is found to have taken money not  his own. The action of the parents faced with this difficulty and  disappointment will determine to a great extent whether the incident  is productive of permanent damage to the child's character. The  peculiar circumstances of each case must be considered. For example,  the parent must bear in mind the relation in which children stand to  all property. The child possesses nothing of his own; everything  belongs in reality to his father and mother, but of all things  necessary for him he has the free and unquestioned use. Unless his  attention has been specially directed to the conception of ownership  and the nature of theft, he may not have reasoned very closely on the  matter at all. Very probably he knows that it is wrong to take what is  not given him, but he does not regard helping himself to some dainty  from a cupboard as more than an act of disobedience to authority. He  may have imbibed no ideas which place the abstraction of money from a  purse belonging to his parents on a different plane, and which have  taught him to regard such an action as especially dishonourable and  criminal. Finally, a child who, undetected, has more than once taken  money belonging to his father and mother, may pass without much  thought to steal from a visitor or a servant. To deal with such a case  effectively, to ensure that it shall never happen again, requires much  insight. If the father, shocked beyond measure to find his son an  incipient criminal, differing in his guilt in no way from boys who are  sent to reformatories as bad characters, convinces the child that  although he did not realise it, he has shown himself unworthy of any  further trust, untold harm will be done. Almost certainly the child  will act in the future according to the suggestions which are thus  implanted in his mind. If the household eyes him askance as a thief,  if confidence is withdrawn from him, he sees himself as others see him  and will react to the suggestions by repeating the offence. The  seriousness of what he has done should be explained to him, and after  due punishment he must be restored completely and ostentatiously to  absolute trust. Only by showing confidence in him can we hope to do  away with the dangers of the whole incident. To inculcate good habits  and encourage good behaviour we must let the child build up his own  reputation for these virtues. It need not make him priggish or  self-satisfied if parents let him understand that they take pride in  seeing him practise and develop the virtue they aim at. For example,  it is desired above all that he should always speak the truth. Then  they must ostentatiously attach to him the reputation of truthfulness  and show their pride in his possessing it. If he falls from grace they  must remember that he is still a child, and that if that reputation is  lightly taken from him and he is accused of a permanent tendency  towards untruthfulness, he is left hopeless and resigned to evil. Let  any mother make the experiment of presenting to her child in this way  a reputation for some particular virtue. For example, if an older  child shows too great a tendency to tease and interfere with the  younger children, let the mother seize the first opportunity which  presents itself to applaud some action in which he has shown  consideration for the others. Let her comment more than once in the  next few days on how careful and gentle the older child is becoming in  his behaviour to the little ones, and in a little the suggestion will  begin to act until the transformation is complete. If, on the other  hand, the mother adopts the opposite course and rebukes the child for  habitual unkindness, she will be apt to find unkindness persisted in.  The criminal records of the nation show too often the truth of the  saying that \"Once a thief always a thief.\" Deprived of his good  repute, man loses his chief protection against evil and his incentive  to good.    The inability of a child--and especially of a nervous and sensitive  child--to form conceptions of his own individuality except from ideas  derived from the suggestions of others, gives us the key to our  management of him and to our control of his conduct. He has, as a  rule, a marvellously quick perception of our own estimate of him, and  unconsciously is influenced by it in his conception of his own  personality, and in all his actions. Parents must believe in his  inherent virtue in spite of all lapses. If they despair it cannot be  hid from the child. He knows it intuitively and despairs also. It is  then that they call him incorrigible. If it happens that one parent  becomes estranged from the child, despairs of all improvement, and  sees in all his conduct the natural result of an inborn disposition to  evil, while the other parent holds to the opinion that the child's  nature is good, and to the belief that all will come right, then often  enough the child's conduct shows the effect of these opposite  influences. In contact with the first he steadily deteriorates,  affording proof after proof that judgment against him has been rightly  pronounced. In contact with the other, though his character and  conduct are bound to suffer from such an unhappy experience, he yet  shows the best side of his nature and keeps alive the conviction that  he is not all bad.    The force of suggestion is still powerful to control conduct and  determine character in later childhood.

As old Gert narrated the story, Aunt Mietje, his wife,  who had had timely notice of the impending visit of the morulaganyi (editor)  from her husband (who slaughtered a sheep in honour of the occasion),  superintended with interesting expectations over frizzling items  in the frying-pan on her fireplace.  Her bright eyes, beaming from  under her headkerchief, suggested how she must have been  the undisputed belle of her day.  The rough wooden table was covered  with the best linen in the native settlement, and on it were laid  some clean plates, and the old yet shining cutlery reserved for  special occasions, besides other signs of an approaching evening meal.  Having learnt the art from an experienced housewife on whose farm  her people were squatting, and improved upon her teaching,  she was famous in the neighbourhood for the excellence of her cooking.  Her only worry in that department was her seeming lack of success  in training her daughters up to her elevation.  She is usually sent for  when important visitors come to Dashfontein, and would then don  her best costume of coloured German print, and carry down with her  the spotless apron which Mrs. V. gave her the preceding New Year;  and in spite of her advancing years, she would cause Anna,  and every other upstart at the homestead, instinctively to play  second fiddle to her.  And when we suggested that our wife  could measure swords (or, shall we say, forks) with her as a cook,  she giggled and remembered some white man's proverb about  the proof of the pudding being in the eating.    After the harrowing experience of the previous week, during which  we were forced to see our fellow-beings hounded out of their homes,  and the homes broken up; their lifelong earnings frittered away  by a law of the land, their only crime being the atrocious one of having  the same colour of skin as our own, and finding ourselves suddenly landed  on an oasis, the farm of a kind Dutchman and his noble wife,  on whose property, and by whose leave, little black piccaninnies  still played about in spite of the law, it can be readily understood  with what comfort we sat down and did justice to the good things  provided by Aunt Mietje.  In the course of her preparation  every step of hers suggested that she entertained no sort of misprised opinion  about her superiority over her compeers; and nothing pleased her better  than when she dazzled her husband and family connexions  with deeds which proved her superiority over her contemporaries,  in everything that tends to make the virtuous and industrious house-wife.  She gave a dramatic ending to her husband's narrative when she said --    \"Who would have thought that Hannetje, naughty little Hannetje,  who was so troublesome when my sister used to nurse her --  who would have thought that she would ever prove to be  the salvation of our people?  Who ever anticipated that all the strong Boers,  on whom we had relied, would desert us when the fate of our whole tribe  hung in the balance?  Natives have been moving from north to south,  and from south to north, all searching at the same time  for homes and grazing for their cattle.  During the last few weeks  the roads were hidden in clouds of dust, sent up by  hundreds of hoofs of hundreds of cattle, their owners with them,  vainly seeking places of refuge; but in the case of Dashfontein,  we reclined on a veritable Mount Ararat, by grace of naughty little Hannetje,  whom God in His mysterious foresight had raised up to be Mrs. van V.,  proprietress of Dashfontein.  If my prayers are of any value,  God will appoint in heaven a special place for her when she gets there,  though, for the sake of our people, I hope that time is very far distant.  However, I hope to be somewhere near:  in truth, I should like  to accompany her, when Elijah's chariot comes for her soul,  so as to render her what little aid I can on board, when she soars  through unknown tracts of space to the spirit world on high,  so that if there be any uncomfortable questions about her maiden vagaries,  I may be there to attest that she has since atoned a hundred fold for each,  and thus accelerate her promotion.  No no, Hannetje is not a Boer vrouw,  she is an angel.\"          Chapter VII     Persecution of Coloured Women in the Orange Free State      Ripe persecution, like the plant    Whose nascence Mocha boasted,    Some bitter fruit produced, whose worth    Was never known till roasted.        When the Free State ex-Republicans made use of the South African Constitution  -- a Constitution which Lord Gladstone says is one after the Boer sentiment --  to ruin the coloured population, they should at least  have confined their persecution to the male portion of the blacks  (as is done in a milder manner in the other three Provinces), and have left  the women and children alone.  According to this class legislation,  no native woman in the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State can reside  within a municipality (whether with or without her parents, or her husband)  unless she can produce a permit showing that she is a servant  in the employ of a white person, this permit being signed  by the Town Clerk.  All repressive measures under the old Republic  (which, in matters of this kind, always showed a regard  for the suzerainty of Great Britain) were mildly applied.  Now, under the Union, the Republicans are told by the Imperial authorities  that since they are self-governing they have the utmost freedom of action,  including freedom to do wrong, without any fear of Imperial interference.  Of this licence the white inhabitants of the Union are making the fullest use.  Like a mastiff long held in the leash they are urging the application  of all the former stringent measures enacted against the blacks,  and the authorities, in obedience to their electoral supporters,  are enforcing these measures with the utmost rigour against the blacks  because they have no votes.    Hence, whereas the pass regulations were formerly never enforced by the Boers  against clergymen's wives or against the families of respectable  native inhabitants, now a minister's wife has not only to produce a pass  on demand, but, like every woman of colour, she has to pay a shilling  for a fresh pass at the end of the month, so that a family consisting of,  say, a mother and five daughters pay the municipality 6s. every month,  whether as a penalty for the colour of their skins or a penalty for their sex  it is not clear which.    There is some unexplained anomaly in this woman's pass business.  If the writer were to go and live in the \"Free\" State, he could  apply for and obtain letters of exemption from the ordinary pass laws;  but if his wife, who has had a better schooling and enjoyed  an older civilization than he, were to go and reside in the \"Free\" State  with her daughters, all of them would be forced to carry passes  on their persons, and be called upon to ransack their skirt pockets  at any time in the public streets at the behest of male policemen  in quest of their passes.  Several white men are at present undergoing  long terms of imprisonment inflicted by the Orange \"Free\" State Circuit Courts  for criminally outraging coloured women whom the pass laws had placed  in the hollow of the hands of these ruffians.  Still many more mothers  are smothering evidence of similar outrages upon innocent daughters --  cases that could never have happened under ordinary circumstances.    The Natives of the \"Free\" State have made all possible constitutional appeals  against these outrages.  In reply to their petitions the Provincial Government  blames the municipalities.  The latter blame the law and the Union Parliament,  and there the matter ends.  We have read the \"Free\" State law  which empowers the municipalities to frame regulations  for the control of Natives, etc., but it must be confessed  that our limited intelligence could discern nothing in it  which could be construed as imposing any dire penalties  on municipalities which emancipate their coloured women  from the burden of the insidious pass law and tax.  Hon. Mr. H. Burton,  as already stated, was Minister for Native Affairs before the Union Government  surrendered to the \"Free\" State reactionaries.  A deputation  consisting of Mrs. A. S. Gabashane, Mrs. Kotsi and Mrs. Louw,  women from Bloemfontein -- the first-named being a clergyman's wife --  waited on him in Capetown on the subject of these grievances,  and he assured them that in response to representations made  by the Native Congress, he had already written to Dr. Ramsbottom,  the Provincial Administrator, asking him to persuade  the \"Free\" State municipalities to relieve the native women from this burden.  And if to relieve native women in the \"Free\" State from a burden  which obtains nowhere else in the Union were unlawful,  as the municipalities aver, Mr. Burton -- a K.C. -- would have been  the last person to ask them to break the law.    Subsequently the women petitioned Lady Gladstone for her intercession.  But we wonder if the petition was ever handed to Lady Gladstone  by the responsible authority who, in this instance, would have been  the Department of Native Affairs.  Notwithstanding all these efforts,  native women in the \"Free\" State are still forced to buy passes  every month or go to prison, and they are still exposed  to the indecent provision of the law authorizing male constables  to insult them by day and by night, without distinction.    After exhausting all these constitutional means on behalf of their women,  and witnessing the spread of the trouble to the women and children  of the country districts under the Natives' Land Act, the male Natives  of the municipalities of the Province of the Orange \"Free\" State  saw their women folk throwing off their shawls and taking the \"law\"  into their "]]]
