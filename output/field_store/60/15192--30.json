Just as the waiters are removing the covers, in stalks the Baron, in his  conical hat, and reconnoitres the viands. Sam, all politeness, invites  him to join the party. \"I tank you,\" replies the Baron, \"but I have my  wet in de next room.\" \"But bring your wet with you,\" rejoins Sam, \"we'll  all have our wet together after dinner,\" thinking the Baron meant his  wine.    The usual inn grace--\"For what we are going to receive, the host expects  to be paid\",--having been said with great feeling and earnestness, they  all set to at the victuals, and little conversation passed until the  removal of the cloth, when Mr. Badchild, calling upon his vice, observed  that as in all probability there were gentlemen of different political  and other opinions present, perhaps the best way would be to give a  comprehensive toast, and so get over any debatable ground,--he therefore  proposed to drink in a bumper \"The king, the queen, and all the royal  family, the ministry, particularly the Master of the Horse, the Army,  the Navy, the Church, the State, and after the excellent dinner they  had eaten, he would include the name of the landlord of the White Hart\"  (great applause). Song from Jerry Hawthorn--\"The King of the Cannibal  Islands\".--The chairman then called upon the company to fill their  glasses to a toast upon which there could be no difference of opinion.  \"It was a sport which they all enjoyed, one that was delightful to the  old and to the young, to the peer and to the peasant, and open to all.  Whatever might be the merits of other amusements, he had never yet met  any man with the hardihood to deny that racing was at once the noblest  and the most legitimate\" (loud cheers, and thumps on the table, that  set all the glasses dancing), \"not only was it the noblest and most  legitimate, but it was the most profitable; and where was the man of  high and honourable principle who did not feel when breathing the pure  atmosphere of that Heath, a lofty self-satisfaction at the thought, that  though he might have left those who were near and dear to him in a less  genial atmosphere, still he was not selfishly enjoying himself, without  a thought for their welfare; for racing, while it brought health and  vigour to the father, also brought what was dearer to the mind of a  parent--the means of promoting the happiness and prosperity of his  family--(immense cheers). With these few observations he should simply  propose 'The Turf,' and may we long be above it\"--(applause and, on the  motion of Mr. Spring, three cheers for Mrs. Badchild and all the little  Badchildren were called for and given). When the noise had subsided. Mr.  Jorrocks very deliberately got up, amid whispers and inquiries as to who  he was. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, with an indignant stare, and a thump on  the table, \"Gentlemen, I say, in much of what has fallen from our worthy  chairman, I go-in-sides, save in what he says about racing--I insists  that 'unting is the sport of sports\" (immense laughter, and cries of  \"wot an old fool!\") \"Gentlemen may laugh, but I say it's a fact, and  though I doesn't wish to create no displeasancy whatsomever, yet I  should despise myself most confoundedly--should consider myself unworthy  of the great and distinguished 'unt to which I have the honour to  belong, if I sat quietly down without sticking up for the chase  (laughter).--I say, it's one of the balances of the constitution  (laughter).--I say, it's the sport of kings! the image of war without  its guilt (hisses and immense laughter). He would fearlessly propose a  bumper toast--he would give them 'fox-hunting.'\" There was some demur  about drinking it, but on the interposition of Sam Spring, who assured  the company that Jorrocks was one of the right sort, and with an  addition proposed by Jerry Hawthorn, which made the toast more  comprehensible, they swallowed it, and the chairman followed it up  with \"The Sod\",--which was drunk with great applause. Mr. Cox of Blue  Hammerton returned thanks. \"He considered cock-fighting the finest of  all fine amusements. Nothing could equal the rush between two prime  grey-hackles--that was his colour. The chairman had said a vast for  racing, and to cut the matter short, he might observe that cock-fighting  combined all the advantages of making money, with the additional benefit  of not being interfered with by the weather. He begged to return his  best thanks for himself and brother sods, and only regretted he had not  been taught speaking in his youth, or he would certainly have convinced  them all, that 'cocking' was the sport.\" \"Coursing\" was the next  toast--for which Arthur Pavis, the jockey, returned thanks. \"He was very  fond of the 'long dogs,' and thought, after racing, coursing was the  true thing. He was no orator, and so he drank off his wine to the health  of the company.\" \"Steeplechasing\" followed, for which Mr. Coalman of  St. Albans returned thanks, assuring the company that it answered his  purpose remarkably well. Then the Vice gave the \"Chair,\" and the Chair  gave the \"Vice\"; and by way of a finale, Mr. Badchild proposed the  game of \"Chicken-hazard,\" observing in a whisper to Mr. Jorrocks, that  perhaps he would like to subscribe to a joint-stock purse for the  purpose of going to hell. To which Mr. Jorrocks, with great gravity,  replied; \"Sir, I'm d----d if I do.\"        VI. A WEEK AT CHELTENHAM: THE CHELTENHAM DANDY    Mr. Jorrocks had been very poorly indeed of indigestion, as he calls  it, produced by tucking in too much roast beef and plum pudding at  Christmas, and prolonging the period of his festivities a little beyond  the season allowed by Moore's _Almanack_, and having in vain applied the  usual remedies prescribed on such occasions, he at length consented to  try the Cheltenham waters, though altogether opposed to the element, he  not having \"astonished his stomach,\" as he says, for the last fifteen  years with a glass of water.    Having established himself and the Yorkshireman in a small private  lodging in High Street, consisting of two bedrooms and a sitting-room,  he commenced his visits to the royal spa, and after a few good drenches,  picked up so rapidly, that to whatever inn they went to dine, the  landlords and waiters were astounded at the consumption of prog, and in  a very short time he was known from the \"Royal Hotel\" down to Hurlston's  Commercial Inn, as the great London Cormorant. At first, however, he was  extremely depressed in spirits, and did nothing the whole day after his  arrival, but talk about the arrangement of his temporal affairs; and the  first symptom he gave of returning health was one day at dinner at the  \"Plough,\" by astonishing two or three scarlet-coated swells, who as  usual were disporting themselves in the coffee-room, by bellowing to the  waiter for some Talli-ho \"sarce\" to his fish. Before this he had never  once spoken of his favourite diversion, and the sportsmen cantered by  the window to cover in the morning, and back in the afternoon, without  eliciting a single observation from him. The morning after this change  for the better, he addressed his companion at breakfast as follows:  \"Blow me tight, Mr. York, if I arn't regularly renowated. I'm as fresh  as an old hat after a shower of rain. I really thinks I shall get over  this terrible illness, for I dreamt of 'unting last night, and, if  you've a mind, we'll go and see my Lord Segrave's reynard dog, and then  start from this 'ere corrupt place, for, you see, it's nothing but a  town, and what's the use of sticking oneself in a little pokey lodging  like this 'ere, where there really is not room to swing a cat, and  paying the deuce knows how much tin, too, when one has a splendid house  in Great Coram Street going on all the time, with a rigler establishment  of servants and all that sort of thing. Now, you knows, I doesn't grudge  a wisit to Margate, though that's a town too, but then, you see, one has  the sea to look at, whereas here, it's nothing but a long street with  shops, not so good as those in Red Lion Street, with a few small streets  branching off from it, and as to the prommenard, as they calls it, aside  the spa, with its trees and garden stuff, why, I'm sure, to my mind, the  Clarence Gardens up by the Regent's Park, are quite as fine. It's true  the doctor says I must remain another fortnight to perfect the cure, but  then them 'ere M.D.'s, or whatever you calls them, are such rum jockeys,  and I always thinks they say one word for the patient and two for  themselves. Now, my chap said, I must only take half a bottle o' black  strap a day at the werry most, whereas I have never had less than a  whole one--his half first, as I say, and my own after--and because I  tells him I take a pint, he flatters himself his treatment is capital,  and that he is a wonderful M.D.; but as a man can't be better than well,  I think we'll just see what there's to be seen in the neighbourhood, and  then cut our sticks, and, as I said before, I should like werry much to  see my Lord Segrave's hounds, in order that I may judge whether there  is anything in the wide world to be compared to the Surrey, for if I  remember right, Mr. Nimrod described them as werry, werry fine, indeed.\"    Having formed this resolution, Jorrocks stamped on the floor (for the  bell was broken) for the little boy who did the odd jobs of the house,  to bring up his Hessian boots, into which having thrust his great  calves, and replaced the old brown great-coat which he uses for a  dressing-gown by a superfine Saxony blue, with metal buttons and pockets  outside, he pulled his wig straight, stuck his white hat with the green  flaps knowingly on his head, and sallied forth for execution as stout"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#20)"],[1,"g; and threatened that whenever he caught  me on shore he would shoot me, and pay for me afterwards.    The small account in which the life of a negro is held in the West  Indies is so universally known, that it might seem impertinent to  quote the following extract, if some people had not been hardy enough  of late to assert that negroes are on the same footing in that respect  as Europeans. By the 329th Act, page 125, of the Assembly of  Barbadoes, it is enacted 'That if any negro, or other slave, under  punishment by his master, or his order, for running away, or any other  crime or misdemeanor towards his said master, unfortunately shall  suffer in life or member, no person whatsoever shall be liable to a  fine; but if any man shall out of _wantonness, or only of  bloody-mindedness, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro, or other  slave, of his own, he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen  pounds sterling_.' And it is the same in most, if not all, of the West  India islands. Is not this one of the many acts of the islands which  call loudly for redress? And do not the assembly which enacted it  deserve the appellation of savages and brutes rather than of  Christians and men? It is an act at once unmerciful, unjust, and  unwise; which for cruelty would disgrace an assembly of those who are  called barbarians; and for its injustice and _insanity_ would shock  the morality and common sense of a Samaide or a Hottentot.    Shocking as this and many more acts of the bloody West India code at  first view appear, how is the iniquity of it heightened when we  consider to whom it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin, a zealous  labourer in the vineyard of slavery, gives an account of a French  planter of his acquaintance, in the island of Martinico, who shewed  him many mulattoes working in the fields like beasts of burden; and he  told Mr. Tobin these were all the produce of his own loins! And I  myself have known similar instances. Pray, reader, are these sons and  daughters of the French planter less his children by being begotten on  a black woman? And what must be the virtue of those legislators, and  the feelings of those fathers, who estimate the lives of their sons,  however begotten, at no more than fifteen pounds; though they should  be murdered, as the act says, _out of wantonness and bloody-mindedness_!  But is not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And  surely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue  involves in its continuance destruction to every principle, and buries  all sentiments in ruin!    I have often seen slaves, particularly those who were meagre, in  different islands, put into scales and weighed; and then sold from  three pence to six pence or nine pence a pound. My master, however,  whose humanity was shocked at this mode, used to sell such by the  lump. And at or after a sale it was not uncommon to see negroes taken  from their wives, wives taken from their husbands, and children from  their parents, and sent off to other islands, and wherever else their  merciless lords chose; and probably never more during life to see each  other! Oftentimes my heart has bled at these partings; when the  friends of the departed have been at the water side, and, with sighs  and tears, have kept their eyes fixed on the vessel till it went out  of sight.    A poor Creole negro I knew well, who, after having been often thus  transported from island to island, at last resided in Montserrat. This  man used to tell me many melancholy tales of himself. Generally, after  he had done working for his master, he used to employ his few leisure  moments to go a fishing. When he had caught any fish, his master would  frequently take them from him without paying him; and at other times  some other white people would serve him in the same manner. One day he  said to me, very movingly, 'Sometimes when a white man take away my  fish I go to my maser, and he get me my right; and when my maser by  strength take away my fishes, what me must do? I can't go to any body  to be righted; then' said the poor man, looking up above 'I must look  up to God Mighty in the top for right.' This artless tale moved me  much, and I could not help feeling the just cause Moses had in  redressing his brother against the Egyptian. I exhorted the man to  look up still to the God on the top, since there was no redress below.  Though I little thought then that I myself should more than once  experience such imposition, and read the same exhortation hereafter,  in my own transactions in the islands; and that even this poor man and  I should some time after suffer together in the same manner, as shall  be related hereafter.    Nor was such usage as this confined to particular places or  individuals; for, in all the different islands in which I have been  (and I have visited no less than fifteen) the treatment of the slaves  was nearly the same; so nearly indeed, that the history of an island,  or even a plantation, with a few such exceptions as I have mentioned,  might serve for a history of the whole. Such a tendency has the  slave-trade to debauch men's minds, and harden them to every feeling  of humanity! For I will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are  born worse than other men--No; it is the fatality of this mistaken  avarice, that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into  gall. And, had the pursuits of those men been different, they might  have been as generous, as tender-hearted and just, as they are  unfeeling, rapacious and cruel. Surely this traffic cannot be good,  which spreads like a pestilence, and taints what it touches! which  violates that first natural right of mankind, equality and  independency, and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which God  could never intend! For it raises the owner to a state as far above  man as it depresses the slave below it; and, with all the presumption  of human pride, sets a distinction between them, immeasurable in  extent, and endless in duration! Yet how mistaken is the avarice even  of the planters? Are slaves more useful by being thus humbled to the  condition of brutes, than they would be if suffered to enjoy the  privileges of men? The freedom which diffuses health and prosperity  throughout Britain answers you--No. When you make men slaves you  deprive them of half their virtue, you set them in your own conduct an  example of fraud, rapine, and cruelty, and compel them to live with  you in a state of war; and yet you complain that they are not honest  or faithful! You stupify them with stripes, and think it necessary to  keep them in a state of ignorance; and yet you assert that they are  incapable of learning; that their minds are such a barren soil or  moor, that culture would be lost on them; and that they come from a  climate, where nature, though prodigal of her bounties in a degree  unknown to yourselves, has left man alone scant and unfinished, and  incapable of enjoying the treasures she has poured out for him!--An  assertion at once impious and absurd. Why do you use those instruments  of torture? Are they fit to be applied by one rational being to  another? And are ye not struck with shame and mortification, to see  the partakers of your nature reduced so low? But, above all, are there  no dangers attending this mode of treatment? Are you not hourly in  dread of an insurrection? Nor would it be surprising: for when        \"--No peace is given      To us enslav'd, but custody severe;      And stripes and arbitrary punishment      Inflicted--What peace can we return?      But to our power, hostility and hate;      Untam'd reluctance, and revenge, though slow,      Yet ever plotting how the conqueror least      May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice      In doing what we most in suffering feel.\"    But by changing your conduct, and treating your slaves as men, every  cause of fear would be banished. They would be faithful, honest,  intelligent and vigorous; and peace, prosperity, and happiness, would  attend you.
