What I _do_ assert is, that  'each soul is, _in part_, its own God--its own Creator.' Just below, the  critic says:--'After all these contradictory propoundings concerning God  we would remind him of what he lays down on page 23--'of this Godhead in  itself he alone is not imbecile--he alone is not impious who propounds  _nothing_. A man who thus conclusively convicts himself of imbecility and  impiety needs no further refutation.' Now the sentence, _as I wrote it_,  and as _I find it_ printed on that very page which the critic refers to  and which _must have been lying before him_ while he quoted my words,  runs thus:--'Of this Godhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile, &c.,  who propounds nothing.' By the italics, as the critic well knew, I design  to distinguish between the two possibilities--that of a knowledge of God  through his works and that of a knowledge of Him in his _essential  nature_. The Godhead, _in itself_, is distinguished from the Godhead  observed _in its effects_. But our critic is zealous. Moreover, being a  divine, he is honest--ingenuous. It is his _duty_ to pervert my meaning  by omitting my italics--just as, in the sentence previously quoted, it  was his Christian duty to falsify my argument by leaving out the two  words, 'in part,' upon which turns the whole force--indeed the whole  intelligibility of my proposition.    \"Were these 'misrepresentations' (_is_ that the name for them?) made for  any less serious a purpose than that of branding my book as 'impious'  and myself as a 'pantheist,' a 'polytheist,' a Pagan, or a God knows what  (and indeed I care very little so it be not a 'Student of Theology'),  I would have permitted their dishonesty to pass unnoticed, through pure  contempt of the boyishness--for the _turn-down-shirt-collar-ness_ of  their tone:--but, as it is, you will pardon me, Mr. Editor, that I have  been compelled to expose a 'critic' who courageously preserving his own  _anonymosity_, takes advantage of my absence from the city to  misrepresent, and thus vilify me, _by name_.    EDGAR A. POE.    \"Fordham, September 20, 1848.\"    From this time Poe did not write much; he had quarreled with the  conductors of the chief magazines for which he had previously written,  and they no longer sought his assistance. In a letter to a friend, he  laments the improbabilities of an income from literary labor, saying:    \"I have represented ---- to you as merely an ambitious simpleton, anxious  to get into society with the reputation of conducting a magazine which  somebody behind the curtain always prevents him from quite damning with  his stupidity; he is a knave and a beast. I cannot write any more for the  Milliner's Book, where T----n prints his feeble and _very_ quietly made  Dilutions of other people's reviews; and you know that ---- can afford to  pay but little, though I am glad to do anything for a good fellow like  ----. In this emergency I sell articles to the vulgar and trashy ----,  for $5 a piece. I inclose my last, cut out, lest you should see by my  sending the paper in what company I am forced to appear.\"    His name was now frequently associated with that of one of the most  brilliant women of New England, and it was publicly announced that they  were to be married. He had first seen her on his way from Boston, when he  visited that city to deliver a poem before the Lyceum there. Restless,  near the midnight, he wandered from, his hotel near where she lived,  until he saw her walking in a garden. He related the incident afterward  in one of his most exquisite poems, worthy of himself, of her, and of the  most exalted passion.      \"I saw thee--once only--years ago;    I must not say _how_ many--but not many.    It was a July midnight; and from out    A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,    Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,    There fell a silvery-silken vail of light,    With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,    Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand    Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,    Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--    Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses    That gave out, in return for the love-light,    Their odorous souls in an estatic death--    Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses    That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted    By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.      \"Clad all in white, upon a violet bank    I saw thee half reclining; while the moon    Fell on upturn'd faces of these roses,    And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!      \"Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--    Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)    That bade me pause before the garden-gate,    To breathe the incense of those Slumbering roses?    No footstep stirred; the hated world all slept,    Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!--oh, God!    How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)    Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--    And in an instant all things disappeared.    (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)    The pearly luster of the moon went out:    The mossy banks and the meandering paths,    The happy flowers and the repining trees,    Were seen no more: the very roses' odors    Died in the arms of the adoring airs,    All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:    Save only the divine light in thine eyes--    Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.    I saw but them--they were the world to me.    I saw but them--saw only them for hours--    Saw only them until the moon went down.    What wild heart histories seemed to lie enwritten    Upon those crystalline celestial spheres!    How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!    How silently serene a sea of pride!    How daring an ambition! Yet how deep--    How fathomless a capacity for love!      \"But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight    Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;    And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees    Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained_.    They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.    Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,    _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.    They follow me--they lead me through the years    They are my ministers--yet I their slave.    Their office is to illumine and enkindle--    My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,    And purified in their electric fire,    And sanctified in their elysian fire.    They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope,)    And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to    In the sad, silent watches of my night;    While even in the meridian glare of day    I see them still--two sweetly scintillant    Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!\"    They were not married, and the breaking of the engagement affords a  striking illustration of his character. He said to an acquaintance  in New York, who congratulated with him upon the prospect of his union  with a person of so much genius and so many virtues--\"It is a mistake: I  am not going to be married.\" \"Why, Mr. Poe, I understand that the bans  have been published.\" \"I cannot help what you have heard, my dear Madam:  but mark me, I shall not marry her.\" He left town the same evening, and  the next day was reeling through the streets of the city which was the  lady's home, and in the evening--that should have been the evening before  the bridal--in his drunkenness he committed at her house such outrages as  made necessary a summons of the police. Here was no insanity leading to  indulgence: he went from New York with a determination thus to induce an  ending of the engagement; and he succeeded.    Sometime in August, 1849, Mr. Poe left New York for Virginia. In  Philadelphia he encountered persons who had been his associates in  dissipations while he lived there, and for several days he abandoned  himself entirely to the control of his worst appetites. When his money  was all spent, and the disorder of his dress evinced the extremity of his  recent intoxication, he asked in charity means for the prosecution of his  journey to Richmond. There, after a few days, he joined a temperance  society, and his conduct showed the earnestness of his determination to  reform his life. He delivered in some of the principal towns of Virginia  two lectures, which were well attended, and renewing his acquaintance  with a lady whom he had known in his youth, he was engaged to marry her,  and wrote to his friends that he should pass the remainder of his days  among the scenes endeared by all his pleasantest recollections of youth.    On Thursday, the 4th of October, he set out for New York, to fulfill a  literary engagement, and to prepare for his marriage. Arriving in  Baltimore he gave his trunk to a porter, with directions to convey it to  the cars which were to leave in an hour or two for Philadelphia, and went  into a tavern to obtain some refreshment. Here he met acquaintances who  invited him to drink; all his resolutions and duties were soon forgotten;  in a few hours he was in such a state as is commonly induced only by  long-continued intoxication; after a night of insanity and exposure, he  was carried to a hospital; and there, on the evening of Sunday, the 7th  of October, 1849, he died, at the age of thirty-eight years.    It is a melancholy history. No author of as much genius had ever in this  country as much unhappiness; but Poe's unhappiness was in an unusual  degree the result of infirmities of nature, or of voluntary faults in  conduct. A writer who evidently knew him well, and who comes before us in  the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" as his defender, is \"compelled to admit  that the blemishes in his life were effects of character rather than of  circumstances.\"[A] How this character might have been modified by a  judicious education of all his faculties I leave for the decision of  others, but it will be evident to those who read this biography that the  unchecked freedom of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#20)"],[1,". Of course  at that distance there could be small chance of missing, and we owned  one each. The Wakamba, who had been watching eagerly, swarmed down,  shouting.    We dined just at sunset under a small tree at the very top of the peak.  Long bars of light shot through the western clouds; the plain turned  from solid earth to a mysterious sea of shifting twilights; the buttes  stood up, wrapped in veils of soft desert colours; Kilimanjaro hung  suspended like a rose-coloured bubble above the abyss beyond the world.          XXI.    RIDING THE PLAINS.      From the mere point of view of lions, lion A hunting was very slow work  indeed. It meant riding the whole of long days, from dawn until dark,  investigating miles of country that looked all alike and in which we  seemed to get nowhere. One by one the long billows of plain fell behind,  until our camp hill had turned blue behind us, and we seemed to be out  in illimitable space, with no possibility, in an ordinary lifetime, of  ever getting in touch with anything again. What from above had looked as  level as a floor now turned into a tremendously wide and placid ground  swell. As a consequence we were always going imperceptibly up and up and  up to a long-delayed sky-line, or tipping as gently down the other side  of the wave. From crest to crest of these long billows measured two or  three miles. The vertical distance in elevation from trough to top was  perhaps not over fifty to one hundred feet.    Slowly we rode along the shallow grass and brush ravines in the troughs  of the low billows, while the dogs worked eagerly in and out of cover,  and our handful of savages cast stones and shouted. Occasionally we  divided forces, and beat the length of a hill, two of us lying in wait  at one end for the possible lion, the rest sweeping the sides and  summits. Many animals came bounding along, but no lions. Then Harold  Hill, unlimbering a huge, many-jointed telescope, would lie flat on his  back, and sight the fearsome instrument over his crossed feet, in a  general bird's-eye view of the plains for miles around. While he was at  it we were privileged to look about us, less under the burden of  responsibility. We could make out the game as little, light-coloured  dots and speckles, thousands upon thousands of them, thicker than cattle  ever grazed on the open range, and as far as the eye could make them  out, and then a glance through our glasses picked them up again for mile  after mile. Even the six-power could go no farther. The imagination was  left the vision of more leagues of wild animals even to the half-guessed  azure mountains--and beyond. I had seen abundant game elsewhere in  Africa, but nothing like the multitudes inhabiting the Kapiti Plains at  that time of year. In other seasons this locality is comparatively  deserted.    The glass revealing nothing in our line, we rode again to the lower  levels, and again took up our slow, painstaking search.    But although three days went by in this manner without our getting a  glimpse of lions, they were far from being days lost. Minor adventure  filled our hours. What elsewhere would be of major interest and strange  and interesting experience met us at every turn. The game, while  abundant, was very shy. This had nothing to do with distrust of hunters,  but merely with the fact that it was the season of green grass. We liked  to come upon animals unexpectedly, to see them buck-jump and cavort.    Otherwise we rode in a moving space cleared of animals, the beasts  unobtrusively giving way before us, and as unobtrusively closing in  behind. The sun flashed on the spears of savages travelling single file  across the distance. Often we stopped short to gaze upon a wild and  tumbled horizon of storm that Gustave Dore might have drawn.    The dogs were always joyously routing out some beast, desirable from  their point of view, and chasing it hopelessly about, to our great  amusement. Once they ran into a giant porcupine-about the size a setter  would be, with shorter legs-which did not understand running away. They  came upon it in a dense thicket, and the ensuing row was unholy. They  managed to kill the porcupine among them, after which we plucked barbed  quills from some very grieved dogs. The quills were large enough to make  excellent penholders. The dogs also swore by all canine gods that they  wouldn't do a thing to a hyena, if only they could get hold of one. They  never got hold of one, for the hyena is a coward. His skull and teeth,  however, are as big and powerful as those of a lioness; so I do not know  which was luckier in his avoidance of trouble--he or the dogs.    Nor from the shooting standpoint did we lack for sport. We had to shoot  for our men, and we occasionally needed meat ourselves. It was always  interesting, when such necessities arose, to stalk the shy buck and do  long-range rifle practice. This shooting, however, was done only after  the day's hunt was over. We had no desire to spoil our lion chances.    The long circle towards our evening camp always proved very long indeed.  We arrived at dusk to find supper ready for us. As we were old  campaigners we ate this off chop boxes as tables, and sat on the ground.  It was served by a Wakamba youth we had nicknamed Herbert Spencer, on  account of his gigantic intellect. Herbert meant well, but about all he  succeeded in accomplishing was a pathetically wrinkled brow of care and  scared eyes. He had never been harshly treated by any of us, but he  acted as though always ready to bolt. If there were twenty easy right  methods of doing a thing and one difficult wrong method, Herbert would  get the latter every time. No amount of experience could teach him the  logic of our simplest ways. One evening he brought a tumbler of mixed  water and condensed milk. Harold Hill glanced into the receptacle.    \"Stir it,\" he commanded briefly.    Herbert Spencer obeyed. We talked about something else. Some five or ten  minutes later one of us noticed that Herbert was still stirring, and  called attention to the fact. When the latter saw our eyes were on him  he speeded up until the spoon fairly rattled in the tumbler. Then, when  he thought our attention had relaxed again, he relaxed also his  efforts--the spoon travelled slower and slower in its dreamy circle. We  amused ourselves for some time thus. Then we became so weak from  laughter that we fell backward off our seats, and some one gasped a  command that Herbert cease.    I am afraid, after a little, that we rather enjoyed mildly tormenting  poor Herbert Spencer. He tried so hard, and looked so scared, and was so  unbelievably stupid! Almost always he had to pick his orders word by  word from a vast amount of high-flown, unnecessary English.    \"O Herbert Spencer,\" the command would run, \"if you would condescend to  bend your mighty intellect to the lowly subject of maji, and will snatch  time from your profound cerebrations to assure its being moto sans, I  would esteem it infinite condescension on your part to let pesi pesi.\"    And Herbert, listening to all this with a painful, strained intensity,  would catch the six-key words, and would falter forth a trembling \"N'dio  bwana.\"    Somewhere down deep within Herbert Spencer's make up, however, was a  sense of moral duty. When we finally broke camp for good, on the great  hill of Lucania, Herbert Spencer, relieved from his job, bolted like a  shot. As far as we could see him he was running at top speed. If he had  not possessed a sense of duty, he would have done this long ago.    We camped always well up on some of the numerous hills; for, although  anxious enough to find lions in the daytime, we had no use for them at  all by night. This usually meant that the boys had to carry water some  distance. We kept a canvas bath-tub full for the benefit of the dogs,  from which they could drink at any time. This necessary privilege after  a hard day nearly drove Captain D. crazy. It happened like this:    We were riding along the slope of a hillside, when in the ravine, a half  mile away and below us, we saw something dark pop up in sight and then  down again. We shouted to some of the savage Wakamba to go and  investigate. They closed in from all sides, their long spears poised to  strike. At the last moment out darted, not an animal, but a badly  frightened old man armed with bow and arrow. He dashed out under the  upraised spears, clasped one of the men around the knees, and implored  protection. Our savages, their spears ready, glanced over their  shoulders for instruction. They would have liked nothing better than to  have spitted the poor old fellow.    We galloped down as fast as possible to the rescue. With reluctance our  spearmen drew back, releasing their prize. We picked up his scattered  bows and arrows, restored them to him, and uttered many reassurances. He  was so badly frightened that he could not stand for the trembling of his  knees. Undoubtedly he thought that war had broken out, and that he was  the first of its unconscious victims. After calming him down, we told  him what we were doing, and offered to shoot him meat if he cared to  accompany us. He accepted the offer with joy. So pleased and relieved  was he, that he skipped about like a young and nimble goat. His hunting  companion, who all this time had stood atop of a hill at a safe  distance, viewed these performances with concern. Our captive shouted  loudly for him to come join us and share in the good fortune. Not he! He  knew a trap when he saw one! Not a bit disturbed by the tales this man  would probably carry back home, our old fellow attached himself to us  for three days!    Near sundown, to make our promise good, and also to give our own men a  feast, I shot two hartebeeste near camp.    The evening was beautiful. The Machakos Range, miles distant across the  valley, was mantled with thick, soft clouds. From our elevation we could  see over them, and"]]]
