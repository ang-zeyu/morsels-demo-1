Throughout all France, and even outside of France, the passions of  religion and ambition were aroused at this summons.    Twelve abbots and twenty monks of Citeaux dispersed themselves in all  directions preaching the crusade; and lords and knights, burghers and  peasants, laymen and clergy, hastened to respond.  \"From near and far  they came,\" says the contemporary poet-chronicler, William of Tudela;  \"there be men from Auvergne and Burgundy, France and Limousin; there be  men from all the world; there be Germans, Poitevines, Gascons, Rouergats,  and Saintongese.  Never did God make scribe who, whatsoever his pains,  could set them all down in writing, in two months or in three.\"  The poet  reckons \"twenty thousand horsemen armed at all points, and more than two  hundred thousand villeins and peasants, not to speak of burghers and  clergy.\"  A less exaggerative though more fanatical writer, Peter of  Vaulx-Cernay, the chief contemporary chronicler of this crusade, contents  himself with saying that, at the siege of Carcassonne, one of the first  operations of the crusaders, \"it was said that their army numbered fifty  thousand men.\"  Whatever may be the truth about the numbers, the  crusaders were passionately ardent and persevering: the war against the  Albigensians lasted fifteen years (from 1208 to 1223), and of the two  leading spirits, one ordering and the other executing, Pope Innocent III.  and Simon de Montfort, neither saw the end of it.  During these fifteen  years, in the region situated between the Rhone, the Pyrenees, the  Garonne, and even the Dordogne, nearly all the towns and strong castles,  Beziers, Carcassonne, Castelnaudary, Lavaur, Gaillac, Moissae, Minerve,  Termes, Toulouse, &c., were taken, lost, retaken, given over to pillage,  sack, and massacre, and burnt by the crusaders with all the cruelty of  fanatics and all the greed of conquerors.  We do not care to dwell here  in detail upon this tragical and monotonous history; we will simply  recall some few of its characteristics.  Doubt has been thrown upon the  answer attributed to Arnauld-Amaury, Abbot of Citeaux, when he was asked,  in 1209, by the conquerors of Beziers, how, at the assault of the city,  they should distinguish the heretics from the faithful: \"Slay them all;  God will be sure to know His own.\"  The doubt is more charitable than  reasonable; for it is a contemporary, himself a monk of Citeaux, who  reports, without any comment, this hateful speech.  Simon de Montfort,  the hero of the crusade, employed similar language.  One day two  heretics, taken at Castres, were brought before him; one of them was  unshakable in his belief, the other expressed a readiness to turn  convert: \"Burn them both,\" said the count; \"if this fellow mean what he  says, the fire will serve for expiation of his sins, and, if he lie, he  will suffer the penalty for his imposture.\"  At the siege of the castle  of Lavaur, in 1211, Amaury, Lord of Montr6al, and eighty knights, had  been made prisoners: and \"the noble Count Simon,\" says Peter of Vaulx-  Cernay, decided to hang them all on one gibbet; but when Amaury, the most  distinguished amongst them, had been hanged, the gallows-poles, which,  from too great haste, had not been firmly fixed in the ground, having  come down, the count, perceiving how great was the delay, ordered the  rest to be slain.  The pilgrims therefore fell upon them right eagerly  and slew them on the spot.  Further, the count caused stones to be heaped  upon the lady of the castle, Amaury's sister, a very wicked heretic, who  had been cast into a well.  Finally our crusaders, with extreme alacrity,  burned heretics without number.\"    In the midst of these atrocious unbridlements of passions supposed to be  religious, other passions were not slow to make their appearance.  Innocent III.  had promised the crusaders the sovereignty of the domains  they might win by conquest from princes who were heretics or protectors  of heretics.  After the capture, in 1209, of Beziers and Carcassonne,  possessions of Raymond Roger, Viscount of Albi, and nephew of the Count  of Toulouse, the Abbot of Citeaux, a legate of the pope, assembled the  principal chiefs of the crusaders that they might choose one amongst them  as lord and governor of their conquests.  The offer was made,  successively, to Eudes, Duke of Burgundy, to Peter de Courtenay, Count of  Nevers, and to Walter de Chatilion, Count of St. Paul; but they all three  declined, saying that they had sufficient domains of their own without  usurping those of the Viscount of Beziers, to whom, in their opinion,  they had already caused enough loss.  The legate, somewhat embarrassed,  it is said, proposed to appoint two bishops and four knights, who, in  concert with him, should choose a new master for the conquered  territories.  The proposal was agreed to, and, after some moments of  hesitation, Simon de Montfort, being elected by this committee, accepted  the proffered domains, and took imdiate possession of them on publication  of a charter conceived as follows: \"Simon, Lord of Montfort, Earl of  Leicester, Viscount of Beziers and Carcassonne.  The Lord having  delivered into my hands the lands of the heretics, an unbelieving people,  that is to say, whatsoever He hath thought fit to take from them by the  hand of the crusaders, His servants, I have accepted humbly and devoutly  this charge and administration, with confidence in His aid.\"  The pope  wrote to him forthwith to confirm him in hereditary possession of his new  dominions, at the same time expressing to him a hope that, in concert  with the legates, he would continue to carry out the extirpation of the  heretics.  The dispossessed Viscount, Raymond Roger, having been put in  prison by his conqueror in a tower of Carcassonne itself, died there at  the end of three months, of disease according to some, and a violent  death according to others; but the latter appears to be a groundless  suspicion, for it was not to cowardly and secret crimes that Simon de  Montfort was inclined.    From this time forth the war in Southern France changed character, or,  rather, it assumed a double character; with the war of religion was  openly joined a war of conquest; it was no longer merely against the  Albigensians and their heresies, it was against the native princes of  Southern France and their domains that the crusade was prosecuted.  Simon  de Montfort was eminently qualified to direct and accomplish this twofold  design: sincerely fanatical and passionately ambitious; of a valor that  knew no fatigue; handsome and strong; combining tact with authority;  pitiless towards his enemies as became his mission of doing justice in  the name of the faith and the Church; a leader faithful to his friends  and devoted to their common cause whilst reckoning upon them for his own  private purposes, he possessed those natural qualities which confer  spontaneous empire over men and those abilities which lure them on by  opening a way for the fulfilment of their interested hopes.  And as for  himself, by the stealthy growth of selfishness, which is so prone to  become developed when circumstances are tempting, he every day made his  personal fortunes of greater and greater account in his views and his  conduct.  His ambitious appetite grew by the very difficulties it  encountered as well as by the successes it fed upon.  The Count of  Toulouse, persecuted and despoiled, complained loudly in the ears of the  pope; protested against the charge of favoring the heretics; offered and  actually made the concessions demanded by Rome; and, as security, gave up  seven of his principal strongholds.  But, being ever too irresolute and  too weak to keep his engagements to his subjects' detriment no less than  to stand out against his adversaries' requirements, he was continually  falling back into the same condition, and keeping off attacks which were  more and more urgent by promises which always remained without effect.  After having sent to Rome embassy upon embassy with explanations and  excuses, he twice went thither himself, in 1210 and in 1215; the first  time alone, the second with his young son, who was then thirteen, and who  was at a later period Raymond VII.  He appealed to the pope's sense of  justice; he repudiated the stories and depicted the violence of his  enemies; and finally pleaded the rights of his son, innocent of all that  was imputed to himself, and yet similarly attacked and despoiled.  Innocent III. had neither a narrow mind nor an unfeeling heart; he  listened to the father's pleading, took an interest in the youth, and  wrote, in April, 1212, and January, 1213, to his legates in Languedoc and  to Simon de Montfort, \"After having led the army of the crusaders into  the domains of the Count of Toulouse, ye have not been content with  invading all the places wherein there were heretics, but ye have further  gotten possession of those where-in there was no suspicion of heresy.  .  .  .  The same ambassadors have objected to us that ye have usurped  what was another's with so much greed and so little consideration that of  all the domains of the Count of Toulouse there remains to him barely the  town of that name, together with the castle of Montauban.  .  .  .  Now,  though the said count has been found guilty of many matters against God  and against the Church, and our legates, in order to force him to  acknowledgment thereof, have excommunicated his person, and have left his  domains to the first captor, nevertheless, he has not yet been condemned  as a heretic nor as an accomplice in the death of Peter de Castelnau, of  sacred memory, albeit he is strongly suspected thereof.  That is why we  did ordain that, if there should appear against him a proper accuser,  within"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#20)"],[1," shall be  anointed and crowned in the city of Rheims, and shall be lieutenant of  the King of Heaven, who is King of France.  It is God's pleasure that our  enemies the English should depart to their own country; if they depart no  evil will come to them, and the kingdom is sure to continue yours.\"  Charles was impressed without being convinced, as so many others had been  before, or were, as he was, on that very day.  He saw Joan again several  times.  She did not delude herself as to the doubts he still entertained.  \"Gentle _dauphin_,\" she said to him one day, \"why do you not believe me?  I say unto you that God hath compassion on you, your kingdom, and your  people; St. Louis and Charlemagne are kneeling before Him, making prayer  for you, and I will say unto you, so please you, a thing which will give  you to understand that you ought to believe me.\"  Charles gave her  audience on this occasion in the presence, according to some accounts, of  four witnesses, the most trusted of his intimates, who swore to reveal  nothing, and, according to others, completely alone.  \"What she said to  him there is none who knows,\" wrote Alan Chartier, a short time after [in  July, 1429], \"but it is quite certain that he was all radiant with joy  thereat as at a revelation from the Holy Spirit.\"  M. Wallop, after a  scrupulous sifting of evidence, has given the following exposition of  this mysterious interview.  \"Sire de Boisy,\" he says, \"who was in his  youth one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber on the most familiar terms  with Charles VII., told Peter Sala, giving the king himself as his  authority for the story, that one day, at the period of his greatest  adversity, the prince, vainly looking for a remedy against so many  troubles, entered in the morning, alone, into his oratory, and there,  without uttering a word aloud, made prayer to God from the depths of his  heart that if he were the true heir, issue of the house of France (and a  doubt was possible with such a queen as Isabel of Bavaria), and the  kingdom ought justly to be his, God would be pleased to keep and defend  it for him; if not, to give him grace to escape without death or  imprisonment, and find safety in Spain or in Scotland, where he intended  in the last resort to seek a refuge.  This prayer, known to God alone,  the Maid recalled to the mind of Charles VII.; and thus is explained the  joy which, as the witnesses say, he testified, whilst none at that time  knew the cause.  Joan by this revelation not only caused the king to  believe in her; she caused him to believe in himself and his right and  title: though she never spoke in that way as of her own motion to the  king, it was always a superior power speaking by her voice, 'I tell thee  on behalf of my Lord that thou art true heir of France, and son of the  king.'\" (Jeanne d'Arc, by M. Wallon, t. i. p. 32.)    Whether Charles VII. were or were not convinced by this interview of  Joan's divine mission, he clearly saw that many of those about him had  little or no faith in it, and that other proofs were required to upset  their doubts.  He resolved to go to Poitiers, where his council, the  parliament, and several learned members of the University of Paris were  in session, and have Joan put to the strictest examination.  When she  learned her destination, she said, \"In the name of God, I know that I  shall have tough work there, but my Lord will help me.  Let us go, then,  for God's sake.\"  On her arrival at Poitiers, on the 11th of March, 1429,  she was placed in one of the most respectable families in the town, that  of John Rabuteau, advocate-general in parliament.  The Archbishop of  Rheims, Reginald de Chartres, Chancellor of France, five bishops, the  king's councillors, several learned doctors, and amongst others Father  Seguin, an austere and harsh Dominican, repaired thither to question her.  When she saw them come in, she went and sat down at the end of the bench,  and asked them what they wanted with her.  For two hours they set  themselves to the task of showing her, \"by fair and gentle arguments,\"  that she was not entitled to belief.  \"Joan,\" said William Aimery,  professor of theology, \"you ask for men-at-arms, and you say that it is  God's pleasure that the English should leave the kingdom of France, and  depart to their own land; if so, there is no need of men-at-arms, for  God's pleasure alone can discomfit them, and force them to return to  their homes.\"  \"In the name of God,\" answered Joan, \"the men-at-arms will  do battle, and God will give them victory.\"  Master William did not urge  his point.  The Dominican, Seguin, \"a very sour man,\" says the chronicle,  asked Joan what language the voices spoke to her.  \"Better than yours,\"  answered Joan.  The doctor spoke the Limousine dialect.  \"Do you believe  in God?\" he asked, ill-humoredly.  \"More than you do,\" retorted Joan,  offended.  \"Well,\" rejoined the monk, \"God forbids belief in you without  some sign tending thereto: I shall not give the king advice to trust  men-at-arms to you, and put them in peril on your simple word.\"  \"In the  name of God,\" said Joan, \"I am not come to Poitiers to show signs; take  me to Orleans, and I will give you signs of what I am sent for.  Let me  have ever so few men-at-arms given me, and I will go to Orleans;\" then,  addressing another of the examiners, Master Peter of Versailles, who was  afterwards Bishop of Meaux, she said, \"I know nor A nor B; but in our  Lord's book there is more than in your books; I come on behalf of the  King of Heaven to cause the siege of Orleans to be raised, and to take  the king to Rheims, that he may be crowned and anointed there.\"  The  examination was prolonged for a fortnight, not without symptoms of  impatience on the part of Joan.  At the end of it, she said to one of the  doctors, John Erault, \"Have you paper and ink?  Write what I shall say to  you.\"  And she dictated a form of letter which became, some weeks later,  the manifesto addressed in a more developed shape by her from Orleans to  the English, calling upon them to raise the siege and put a stop to the  war.  The chief of those piously and patriotically heroic phrases were as  follows:--         \"Jesu Maria,         \"King of England, account to the King of Heaven for His blood royal.       Give up to the Maid the keys of all the good towns you have taken by       force.  She is come from God to avenge the blood royal, and quite       ready to make peace, if you will render proper account.  If you do       not so I am a war-chief; in whatsoever place I shall fall in with       your folks in France, if they be not willing to obey, I shall make       them get thence, whether they will or not; and if they be willing to       obey, I will receive them to mercy.  .  .  .  The Maid cometh from       the King of Heaven as His representative, to thrust you out of       France; she doth promise and certify you that she will make therein       such mighty _haha_ [great tumult], that for a thousand years       hitherto in France was never the like.  .  .  .  Duke of Bedford,       who call yourself regent of France, the Maid doth pray you and       request you not to bring destruction on yourself; if you do not       justice towards her, she will do the finest deed ever done in       Christendom.         \"Writ on Tuesday in the great week.\" [Easter week, March, 1429].       Subscribed: \"Hearken to the news from God and the         Maid.\"    At the end of their examination, the doctors decided in Joan's favor.  Two of them, the Bishop of Castres, Gerard Machet, the king's confessor,  and Master John Erault, recognized the divine nature of her mission.  She  was, they said, the virgin foretold in the ancient prophecies, notably in  those of Merlin; and the most exacting amongst them approved of the  king's having neither accepted nor rejected, with levity, the promises  made by Joan; \"after a grave inquiry there had been discovered in her,\"  they said, \"nought but goodness, humility, devotion, honesty, simplicity.  Before Orleans she professes to be going to show her sign; so she must be  taken to Orleans, for to give her up without any appearance on her part  of evil would be to fight against the Holy Spirit, and to become unworthy  of aid from God.\"  After the doctors' examination came that of the women.  Three of the greatest ladies in France, Yolande of Arragon, Queen of  Sicily; the Countess of Gaucourt, wife of the Governor of Orleans; and  Joan de Mortemer, wife of Robert le Macon, Baron of Troves, were charged  to examine Joan as to her life as a woman.  They found therein nothing  but truth, virtue, and modesty; \"she spoke to them with such sweetness  and grace,\" says the chronicle, \"that she drew tears from their eyes;\"  and she excused herself to them for the dress she wore, and for which the  sternest doctors had not dreamed of reproaching her.  \"It is more  decent,\" said the Archbishop of Embrun, \"to do such things in man's  dress, since they must be done along with men.\"  The men of intelligence  at court bowed down before this village-saint, who was coming to bring to  the king in his peril assistance from God; the most valiant men of war  were moved by the confident outbursts of her patriotic courage; and the  people everywhere welcomed her with faith and enthusiasm.  Joan had as  yet only just appeared, and already she was the heaven-sent interpretress  of the nation's feeling, the hope of the people of France.    Charles no longer hesitated.  Joan was treated, according to her own  expression in her letter to the English, \"as a war-chief;\" there were  assigned to her a squire, a page, two heralds, a chaplain, Brother  Pasquerel, of the order of the hermit-brotherhood of St. Augustin,  varlets, and serving-folks.  A complete suit of armor was made to fit  her.  Her two guides, John of Metz and Bertrand of Poulengy, had not  quitted her; and the king continued them in her train.  Her sword "]]]
