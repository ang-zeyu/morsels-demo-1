We shall not pretend to have given in these pages a  complete and faultless history; but we shall consider ourselves well  rewarded for this work, which is intended to reach the great public, if  we have roused their curiosity and sympathy with a group of artists whom  we consider admirable; and if we have rectified, in the eyes of the  readers of a foreign nation, the errors, the slanders, the undeserved  reproaches, with which Frenchmen have been pleased to overwhelm sincere  creators who thought with faith and love of the pure tradition of the  national genius, and who have for that reason been vilified as much as  if they had in an access of anarchical folly risen against the very  common sense, taste, reason and clearness, which will remain the eternal  merits of their soil. This small, imperfect volume will perhaps find its  best excuse in its intention of repairing an old injustice and of  affirming a useful and permanent truth: that of the authenticity of the  classicism of Impressionism, in the face of the false classicism of the  academic world which official honours have made the guardian of a French  heritage, whose soul it denied and whose spirit it deceived with its  narrow and cold formulas."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#20)"],[1,"they were incompatible.    They were profoundly incompatible. In all things she was defensive. She  never came out; never once had she surprised him halfway upon the road  to her. He had to go all the way to her and knock and ring, and then she  answered faithfully. She never surprised him even by unkindness. If he  had a cut finger she would bind it up very skilfully and healingly, but  unless he told her she never discovered he had a cut finger. He was  amazed she did not know of it before it happened. He piped and she did  not dance. That became the formula of his grievance. For several unhappy  years she thwarted him and disappointed him, while he filled her with  dumb inexplicable distresses. He had been at first so gay an activity,  and then he was shattered; fragments of him were still as gay and  attractive as ever, but between were outbreaks of anger, of hostility,  of something very like malignity. Only very slowly did they realise the  truth of their relationship and admit to themselves that the fine bud  of love between them had failed to flower, and only after long years  were they able to delimit boundaries where they had imagined union, and  to become--allies. If it had been reasonably possible for them to part  without mutual injury and recrimination they would have done so, but two  children presently held them, and gradually they had to work out the  broad mutual toleration of their later relations. If there was no love  and delight between them there was a real habitual affection and much  mutual help. She was proud of his steady progress to distinction, proud  of each intimation of respect he won; she admired and respected his  work; she recognised that he had some magic, of liveliness and  unexpectedness that was precious and enviable. So far as she could help  him she did. And even when he knew that there was nothing behind it,  that it was indeed little more than an imaginative inertness, he could  still admire and respect her steady dignity and her consistent  honourableness. Her practical capacity was for him a matter for  continual self-congratulation. He marked the bright order of her  household, her flowering borders, the prosperous high-born roses of her  garden with a wondering appreciation. He had never been able to keep  anything in order. He relied more and more upon her. He showed his  respect for her by a scrupulous attention to her dignity, and his  confidence by a franker and franker emotional neglect. Because she  expressed so little he succeeded in supposing she felt little, and since  nothing had come out of the brown depths of her eyes he saw fit at last  to suppose no plumb-line would ever find anything there. He pursued his  interests; he reached out to this and that; he travelled; she made it a  matter of conscience to let him go unhampered; she felt, she  thought--unrecorded; he did, and he expressed and re-expressed and  over-expressed, and started this and that with quick irrepressible  activity, and so there had accumulated about them the various items of  the life to whose more ostensible accidents Mr. Direck was now for an  indefinite period joined.    It was in the nature of Mr. Britling to incur things; it was in the  nature of Mrs. Britling to establish them. Mr. Britling had taken the  Dower House on impulse, and she had made it a delightful home. He had  discovered the disorderly delights of mixed Sunday hockey one week-end  at Pontings that had promised to be dull, and she had made it an  institution.... He had come to her with his orphan boy and a memory of a  passionate first loss that sometimes, and more particularly at first, he  seemed to have forgotten altogether, and at other times was only too  evidently lamenting with every fibre of his being. She had taken the  utmost care of the relics of her duskily pretty predecessor that she  found in unexpected abundance in Mr. Britling's possession, and she had  done her duty by her sometimes rather incomprehensible stepson. She  never allowed herself to examine the state of her heart towards this  youngster; it is possible that she did not perceive the necessity for  any such examination....    So she went through life, outwardly serene and dignified, one of a great  company of rather fastidious, rather unenterprising women who have  turned for their happiness to secondary things, to those fair inanimate  things of household and garden which do not turn again and rend one, to  aestheticisms and delicacies, to order and seemliness. Moreover she  found great satisfaction in the health and welfare, the growth and  animation of her own two little boys. And no one knew, and perhaps even  she had contrived to forget, the phases of astonishment and  disillusionment, of doubt and bitterness and secret tears, that spread  out through the years in which she had slowly realised that this  strange, fitful, animated man who had come to her, vowing himself hers,  asking for her so urgently and persuasively, was ceasing, had ceased, to  love her, that his heart had escaped her, that she had missed it; she  never dreamt that she had hurt it, and that after its first urgent,  tumultuous, incomprehensible search for her it had hidden itself  bitterly away....      Section 4    The mysterious processes of nature that had produced Mr. Britling had  implanted in him an obstinate persuasion that somewhere in the world,  from some human being, it was still possible to find the utmost  satisfaction for every need and craving. He could imagine as existing,  as waiting for him, he knew not where, a completeness of understanding,  a perfection of response, that would reach all the gamut of his feelings  and sensations from the most poetical to the most entirely physical, a  beauty of relationship so transfiguring that not only would she--it went  without saying that this completion was a woman--be perfectly beautiful  in its light but, what was manifestly more incredible, that he too would  be perfectly beautiful and quite at his ease.... In her presence there  could be no self-reproaches, no lapses, no limitations, nothing but  happiness and the happiest activities.... To such a persuasion half the  imaginative people in the world succumb as readily and naturally as  ducklings take to water. They do not doubt its truth any more than a  thirsty camel doubts that presently it will come to a spring.    This persuasion is as foolish as though a camel hoped that some day it  would drink from such a spring that it would never thirst again. For the  most part Mr. Britling ignored its presence in his mind, and resisted  the impulses it started. But at odd times, and more particularly in the  afternoon and while travelling and in between books, Mr. Britling so far  succumbed to this strange expectation of a wonder round the corner that  he slipped the anchors of his humour and self-contempt and joined the  great cruising brotherhood of the Pilgrims of Love....    In fact--though he himself had never made a reckoning of it--he had  been upon eight separate cruises. He was now upon the eighth....    Between these various excursions--they took him round and about the  world, so to speak, they cast him away on tropical beaches, they left  him dismasted on desolate seas, they involved the most startling  interventions and the most inconvenient consequences--there were  interludes of penetrating philosophy. For some years the suspicion had  been growing up in Mr. Britling's mind that in planting this persuasion  in his being, the mysterious processes of Nature had been, perhaps for  some purely biological purpose, pulling, as people say, his leg, that  there were not these perfect responses, that loving a woman is a thing  one does thoroughly once for all--or so--and afterwards recalls  regrettably in a series of vain repetitions, and that the career of the  Pilgrim of Love, so soon as you strip off its credulous glamour, is  either the most pitiful or the most vulgar and vile of perversions from  the proper conduct of life. But this suspicion had not as yet grown to  prohibitive dimensions with him, it was not sufficient to resist the  seasons of high tide, the sudden promise of the salt-edged breeze, the  invitation of the hovering sea-bird; and he was now concealing beneath  the lively surface of activities with which Mr. Direck was now familiar,  a very extensive system of distresses arising out of the latest, the  eighth of these digressional adventures....    Mr. Britling had got into it very much as he had got into the ditch on  the morning before his smash. He hadn't thought the affair out and he  hadn't looked carefully enough. And it kept on developing in just the  ways he would rather that it didn't.    The seventh affair had been very disconcerting. He had made a fool of  himself with quite a young girl; he blushed to think how young; it  hadn't gone very far, but it had made his nocturnal reflections so  disagreeable that he had--by no means for the first time--definitely  and forever given up these foolish dreams of love. And when Mrs.  Harrowdean swam into his circle, she seemed just exactly what was wanted  to keep his imagination out of mischief. She came bearing flattery to  the pitch of adoration. She was the brightest and cleverest of young  widows. She wrote quite admirably criticism in the _Scrutator_ and the  _Sectarian_, and occasionally poetry in the _Right Review_--when she  felt disposed to do so. She had an intermittent vein of high spirits  that was almost better than humour and made her quickly popular with  most of the people she met, and she was only twenty miles away in her  pretty house and her absurd little jolly park.    There was something, she said, in his thought and work that was like  walking in mountains. She came to him because she wanted to clamber  about the peaks and glens of his mind.    It was natural to reply that he wasn't by any means the serene mountain  elevation she thought him,"]]]
