For is not Mr. Nachez the composer of the \"Gypsy Dances\" for  violin and piano, which have made him famous?    Genuinely musical, effective and largely successful as they have been,  however, as any one who has played them can testify, the composer of  the \"Gypsy Dances\" regards them with mixed feelings. \"I have done other  work that seems to me, relatively, much more important,\" said Mr.  Nachez, \"but when my name happens to be mentioned, echo always answers  'Gypsy Dances,' my little rubbishy 'Gypsy Dances!' It is not quite fair.  I have published thirty-five works, among them a 'Requiem Mass,' an  orchestral overture, two violin concertos, three rhapsodies for violin  and orchestra, variations on a Swiss theme, Romances, a Polonaise  (dedicated to Ysaye), and Evening Song, three _Poemes hongrois_, twelve  classical masterworks of the 17th century--to say nothing of songs,  etc.--and the two concertos of Vivaldi and Nardini which I have edited,  practically new creations, owing to the addition of the piano  accompaniments and orchestral score. I wrote the 'Gypsy Dances' as a  mere boy when I was studying with H. Leonard in Paris, and really at his  suggestion. In one of my lessons I played Sarasate's 'Spanish Dances,'  which chanced to be published at the time, and at once made a great hit.  So Leonard said to me: 'Why not write some _Hungarian_ Gypsy  dances--there must be wonderful material at hand in the music of the  _Tziganes_ of Hungary. You should do something with it!' I took him at  his word, and he liked my 'Dances' so well that he made me play them at  his musical evenings, which he gave often during the winter, and which  were always attended by the musical _Tout Paris!_ I may say that during  these last thirty years there has been scarcely a violinist before the  public who at one time or the other has _not_ played these 'Gypsy  Dances.' Besides the _original_ edition, there are two (pirated!)  editions in America and six in Europe.            [Illustration: TIVADAR NACHEZ, with hand-written note]             THE BEGINNING OF A VIOLINISTIC CAREER: PLAYING WITH LISZT    \"No, Leonard was not my first teacher. I took up violin work when a boy  of five years of age, and for seven years practiced from eight to ten  hours a day, studying with Sabathiel, the leader of the Royal Orchestra  in Budapest, where I was born, though England, the land of my adoption,  in which I have lived these last twenty-six years, is the land where I  have found all my happiness, and much gratifying honor, and of which I  have been a devoted, ardent and loyal naturalized citizen for more than  a quarter of a century. Sabathiel was an excellent routine teacher, and  grounded me well in the fundamentals--good tone production and  technical control. Later I had far greater teachers, and they taught me  much, but--in the last analysis, most of the little I have achieved I  owe to myself, to hard, untiring work: I had determined to be a  violinist and I trust I became one. No serious student of the instrument  should ever forget that, no matter who his teacher may be, he himself  must supply the determination, the continued energy and devotion which  will lead him to success.    \"Playing with Liszt--he was an intimate friend of my father--is my most  precious musical recollection of Budapest. I enjoyed it a great deal  more than my regular lesson work. He would condescend to play with me  some evenings and you can imagine what rare musical enjoyment, what  happiness there was in playing with such a genius! I was still a boy  when with him I played the Grieg F major sonata, which had just come  fresh from the press. He played with me the D minor sonata of Schumann  and introduced me to the mystic beauties of the Beethoven sonatas. I can  still recall how in the Beethoven C minor sonata, in the first movement,  Liszt would bring out a certain broken chromatic passage in the left  hand, with a mighty _crescendo_, an effect of melodious thunder, of  enormous depth of tone, and yet with the most exquisite regard for the  balance between the violin and his own instrument. And there was not a  trace of condescension in his attitude toward me; but always  encouragement, a tender affectionate and paternal interest in a young  boy, who at _that moment_ was a brother artist.    \"Through Liszt I came to know the great men of Hungarian music of that  time: Erkel, Hans Richter, Robert Volkmann, Count Geza Zichy, and  eventually I secured a scholarship, which the King had founded for  music, to study with Joachim in Berlin, where I remained nearly three  years. Hubay was my companion there; but afterward we separated, he  going to Vieuxtemps, while I went to Leonard.                       JOACHIM AS A TEACHER AND INTERPRETER    \"Joachim was, perhaps, the most celebrated teacher of his time. Yet it  is one of the greatest ironies of fate that when he died there was not  one of his pupils who was considered by the German authorities 'great'  enough to take the place the Master had held. Henri Marteau, who was  not his pupil, and did not even exemplify his style in playing, was  chosen to succeed him! Henri Petri, a Vieuxtemps pupil who went to  Joachim, played just as well when he came to him as when he left him.  The same might be said of Willy Burmester, Hess, Kes and Halir, the  latter one of those Bohemian artists who had a tremendous 'Kubelik-like'  execution. Teaching is and always will be a special gift. There are many  minor artists who are wonderful 'teachers,' and _vice versa_!    \"Yet if Joachim may be criticized as regards the way of imparting the  secrets of technical phases in his violin teaching, as a teacher of  interpretation he was incomparable! As an interpreter of Beethoven and  of Bach in particular, there has never been any one to equal Joachim.  Yet he never played the same Bach composition twice in the same way. We  were four in our class, and Hubay and I used to bring our copies of the  sonatas with us, to make marginal notes while Joachim played to us, and  these instantaneous musical 'snapshots' remain very interesting. But no  matter how Joachim played Bach, it was always with a big tone, broad  chords of an organ-like effect. There is no greater discrepancy than the  edition of the Bach sonatas published (since his death) by Moser, and  which is supposed to embody Joachim's interpretation. Sweeping chords,  which Joachim always played with the utmost breadth, are 'arpeggiated'  in Moser's edition! Why, if any of his pupils had ever attempted to  play, for instance, the end of the _Bouree_ in the B minor _Partita_ of  Bach _a la Moser_, Joachim would have broken his bow over their heads!                                STUDYING WITH LEONARD    \"After three years' study I left Joachim and went to Paris. Liszt had  given me letters of introduction to various French artists, among them  Saint-Saens. One evening I happened to hear Leonard play Corelli's _La  Folia_ in the _Salle Pleyel_, and the liquid clarity and beauty of his  tone so impressed me that I decided I must study with him. I played for  him and he accepted me as a pupil. I am free to admit that my tone,  which people seem to be pleased to praise especially, I owe entirely to  Leonard, for when I came to him I had the so-called 'German tone' (_son  allemand_), of a harsh, rasping quality, which I tried to abandon  absolutely. Leonard often would point to his ears while teaching and  say: '_Ouvrez vos oreilles: ecoutez la beaute du son!_' ('Open your  ears, listen for beauty of sound!'). Most Joachim pupils you hear  (unless they have reformed) attack a chord with the nut of the bow, the  German method, which unduly stresses the attack. Leonard, on the  contrary, insisted with his pupils on the attack being made with such  smoothness as to be absolutely unobtrusive. Being a nephew of Mme.  Malibran, he attached special importance to the 'singing' tone, and  advised his pupils to hear great singers, to _listen_ to them, and to  try and reproduce their _bel canto_ on the violin.    \"He was most particular in his observance of every _nuance_ of shading  and expression. He told me that when he played Mendelssohn's concerto  (for the first time) at the Leipsic _Gewandhaus_, at a rehearsal,  Mendelssohn himself conducting, he began the first phrase with a full  _mezzo-forte_ tone. Mendelssohn laid his hand on his arm and said: 'But  it begins _piano!_' In reply Leonard merely pointed with his bow to the  score--the _p_ which is now indicated in all editions had been omitted  by some printer's error, and he had been quite within his rights in  playing _mezzo-forte_.    \"Leonard paid a great deal of attention to scales and the right way to  practice them. He would say, _'Il faut filer les sons: c'est l'art des  maitres_. ('One must spin out the tone: that is the art of the  masters.') He taught his pupils to play the scales with long, steady  bowings, counting sixty to each bow. Himself a great classical  violinist, he nevertheless paid a good deal of attention to _virtuoso_  pieces; and always tried to prepare his pupils for _public life_. He had  all sorts of wise hints for the budding concert artist, and was in the  habit of saying: 'You must plan a program as you would the _menu_ of a  dinner: there should be something for every one's taste. And,  especially, if you are playing on a long program, together with other  artists, offer nothing indigestible--let _your_ number be a relief!'                                      SIVORI    \"While studying with Leonard I met Sivori, Paganini's only pupil (if we  except Catarina Caleagno), for whom Paganini wrote a concerto and six  short sonatas. Leonard took me to see him late one evening at the _Hotel  de Havane_ in Paris, where Sivori was staying. When we came to his room  we heard the sound of slow scales, beautifully played, coming from  behind the closed door."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#20)"],[1,"were many causes that produced independent rebellions, such as the  greased cartridges served out to the Sepoys, though this was only  insignificant. There were too many Bramins in the ranks, and they were  fanatics; and biting off the cartridge brought their lips in contact with  the grease, which was religious pollution to them. A score of provocatives  might be mentioned, but all of them would not explain it. The natives had  been transformed into trained soldiers, and they felt the power that was in  them.    \"Before the mutiny, one British soldier to six Sepoys was about the  proportion between them in numbers. The small discontents clustered around  this grand error, and broke out in the mutiny. After its suppression, one  of the first reforms of the government was to change the proportion of the  soldiers; and now they are as one European to two natives. The government  is liberal in the introduction of improvements. Now all the strategetic  points are under the control of our own soldiers; and at present they  constitute nearly the whole of the artillery force of the country. Peace  and order have reigned since 1858, and it is not now believed that a  rebellion is possible. I expect and hope to be with you for some time to  come, and my companions and myself will do our best to inform you in regard  to everything in which you may feel an interest.\"    The viscount bowed very politely to his audience, and was hailed with all  the enthusiasm which could be gathered up by a baker's dozen Americans. All  of them testified that they had been exceedingly interested in his address,  especially that part relating to the mutiny.    \"We shall be exceedingly happy in your company, my Lord, as long as you are  pleased to remain with us,\" added the commander. \"I have done something  towards preparing a route through India; and I should be glad to have the  advice of such counsellors as we were so fortunate as to pick up in the  midst of the rage of the stormy ocean.\"    \"The time of our party is at your disposal for as long a period as we can  be of service to you. We do not wish to force ourselves upon you. We owe  our lives to you, and we believe we may contribute to your pleasure and  instruction; for we are at home here.\"    \"We did only our duty when we found you on the wreck; and anything in the  nature of a recompense for the service which every sailor owes to his  fellow-men, or to those who sail on the seas, would be repugnant to me, as  it would be to my officers,\" replied Captain Ringgold.    \"I beg you will not regard my proposition as anything in the shape of a  recompense; for all our fortunes and all our time for years to come would  not be an adequate return for the immeasurable service you have rendered to  us,\" protested the viscount. \"We have all been delighted with the manner in  which we have been entertained on board of the Guardian-Mother; and without  regard to our rescue from the very jaws of death, I declare, upon my honor  as a gentleman, that you have won our hearts,--you, Mr. Commander, and all  connected with you on board.\"    \"Amen!\" shouted Dr. Ferrolan in a burst of enthusiasm.    \"So say we all of us!\" cried Sir Modava.    \"Now permit me to say in all sincerity, that if our acquaintance had begun  when we set foot on the deck of your ship, and the noble conduct of the  ship's company were entirely obliterated from our memories, we should feel  as we do now,\" said Lord Tremlyn.    \"So say we all of us,\" sang the doctor with Sir Modava.    \"I may say that if I had gone on board of the Guardian-Mother for the first  time in the harbor of Bombay, I should have felt the same, and had just as  strong a desire to assist you in seeing India. When gentlemen of education  and character come here from England, the officials give them a warm  welcome, and do their best to enable them to see the country, its manners  and customs, and its institutions, to the best advantage. We should do the  same with Americans; and I account myself fortunate in being the first to  greet you, and welcome you to India.\"    The other two heartily responded to the sentiments of the speaker, and the  commander could say no more. By this time the steamer was in the midst of  the fishing-boats and other craft. Louis called for three cheers for the  guests, and they were given with vigor and sincerity. The party separated,  and its members gave themselves up to an examination of the surroundings.                                           CHAPTER XV                      ARRIVAL OF THE GUARDIAN-MOTHER AT BOMBAY      The coast of Bombay was in plain sight, the province, or state, whose  capital has the same name. Groves of cocoanut, date, and other palm-trees  bordered it; and far back of it was a range of mountains, the Western  Ghats, a chain extending for hundreds of miles along the shore, though from  twenty to fifty miles from it.    The fishing-boats were Oriental, and nothing new to the tourists; but the  men in them were swarthy-looking fellows, not abundantly provided with  clothing. The greater portion of India has a warm climate, and the dress of  the people is adapted to it. For the most part, the natives are bundled up  in loose white cotton cloth, or what was originally white, which they twist  about their bodies with a skill acquired by practice. But these boatmen  were almost in a primitive condition.    The distinguished guests on board of the Guardian-Mother were perfectly  familiar with Bombay and its surroundings, as they were with all of the  country, and their services were just now in demand. The Woolridges had  attached themselves to Lord Tremlyn; Louis Belgrave was very likely to be  in their company most of the time, and the viscount had manifested no  little interest in the young millionaire. He was pointing out the country,  and describing it, to this group of four.    Dr. Ferrolan was not so much of a ladies' man as his two younger  companions, and was rendering similar service to his professional brother,  Uncle Moses, and Professor Giroud. They formed a quartet of educated men,  and were more in touch with each other than they might otherwise have been.  Sir Modava Rao had attracted to his side Mrs. Belgrave; Mrs. Blossom was  usually her shadow; and of course Captain Ringgold, when not employed in  his duties in the navigation of the steamer, gravitated, not materially but  sentimentally, to this group; for wherever Mrs. Belgrave was, the commander  was not far off.    Felix divided himself up among the three parties; and, as he was a lively  boy, he afforded no little amusement to all of them. The entire company,  including the captain and the third officer, who were to take part in the  business of sight-seeing, consisted of sixteen persons, which was just the  complement for four carriages, if they were large enough to seat four.    The pilot came on board, and was inducted into the pilot-house. He spoke  English, and seemed to be a bright fellow so far as his occupation was  concerned. The pilots are said to \"pool their issues,\" and divide their  fees. They take their own time, therefore, and are very independent. But  this one, when informed that the Guardian-Mother was a yacht conveying a  young millionaire all-over-the-world, was very respectful and deferential.    \"I have heard of this vessel before, and they say here that the young rajah  is worth millions of pounds,\" said he, when he had laid the course of the  steamer.    \"I suppose he is as well off as some of your Grand Moguls; but I think you  had better call it dollars instead of pounds,\" replied Mr. Boulong,  laughing at the absurdity of the story; but the pilot knew nothing about  dollars, and perhaps the reports had been swelled by changing the unit of  American currency into that of the British Empire.    \"Now you can see the islands more distinctly,\" said Lord Tremlyn to his  group.    \"I don't see any islands,\" replied Miss Blanche.    \"They are too near together to be distinguished separately. The Bombay to  which we are going is an island eleven and a half miles long. The town has  an abundant territory; but large as it is, portions of it are very densely  peopled, averaging twenty-one inmates to a house,\" continued the viscount.  \"Next to Calcutta it is the largest city in India, and comes within 40,000  of that.    \"Bombay has had its vicissitudes. Of course you know that your Civil War  produced a cotton famine in Europe; but it raised this city to the pinnacle  of prosperity. A reign of speculation came here, and it was believed that  Bombay would be the leading cotton mart of the world. Companies were  organized to develop the resources of the country in the textile plant; and  the fever raged as high as it did when the South Sea Bubble was blown up,  or as it has sometimes in New York and other cities of your country.    \"New banks were started; merchants plunged recklessly into the vortex of  speculation. Then came the news of the surrender of General Lee, and the  end of the war in America. The bubble burst, even before it was fully  inflated, and the business prosperity of Bombay collapsed. The certificates  of shares in companies and banks were not worth the paper on which they  were written. Even the Bank of Bombay, believed to be as solid as the 'Old  Lady' of Threadneedle Street, had to suspend, and the commercial distress  was frightful.    \"But it left its lesson behind it; and since that time Bombay has patiently  and painfully regained its former solid prosperity. It has recovered what  it lost, and is now steadily increasing in population and wealth.\"    \"I never heard of the South Sea Bubble of which you speak,\" said Louis.    \"That is not strange, as it was an affair of one hundred and eighty-one  years ago,\" replied Lord Tremlyn. \"I have not time now to describe it in  full. The floating debt of England at that time was L10,000,000; and the  Earl of Oxford concocted a scheme to pay it off,"]]]
