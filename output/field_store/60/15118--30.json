The Happy  Family kept sedulously away from the two and tried to grow interested  in other things until the final test.    It came, when Billy Roberts, again first, mounted the HS sorrel, still  in murderous mood and but little the worse for his previous battle.  What he had done with Andy he repeated, and added much venom to the  repetition. Again he threw himself backward, which Billy expected and  so got clear and remounted as he scrambled up. After that, the sorrel  simply pitched so hard and so fast that he loosened Billy a bit; not  much, but enough to \"show daylight\" between rider and saddle for two  or three high, crooked jumps. One stirrup he lost, rode a jump without  it and by good luck regained it as it flew against his foot. It was  great riding, and a gratifying roar of applause swept out to him when  it was over.    Andy, saddling the blue roan, drew a long breath. This one ride would  tell the tale, and he was human enough to feel a nervous strain such  as had not before assailed him. It was so close, now! and it might  soon be so far. A bit of bad luck such as may come to any man, however  great his skill, and the belt would go to Billy. But not for long  could doubt or questioning hold Andy Green. He led the Weaver out  himself, and instinctively he felt that the horse remembered him and  would try all that was in him. Also, he was somehow convinced that the  blue roan held much in reserve, and that it would be a great fight  between them for mastery.    When he gathered up the reins, the roan eyed him wickedly sidelong and  tightened his muscles, as it were, for the struggle. Andy turned the  stirrup, put in his toe, and went up in a flash, warned by something  in the blue roan's watchful eye. Like a flash the blue roan also went  up--but Andy had been a fraction of a second quicker. There was a  squeal that carried to the grand stand as the Weaver, wild-eyed and  with red flaring nostrils, pounded the wind-baked sod with high,  bone-racking jumps; changed and took to \"weaving\" till one wondered  how he kept his footing--more particularly, how Andy contrived to sit  there, loose-reined, firm-seated, riding easily. The roan, tiring of  that, began \"swapping ends\" furiously and so fast one could scarce  follow his jumps. Andy, with a whoop of pure defiance, yanked off his  hat and beat the roan over the head with it, yelling taunting words  and contemptuous; and for every shout the Weaver bucked harder and  higher, bawling like a new-weaned calf.    Men who knew good riding when they saw it went silly and yelled and  yelled. Those who did not know anything about it caught the infection  and roared. The judges galloped about, backing away from the living  whirlwind and yelling with the rest. Came a lull when the roan stood  still because he lacked breath to continue, and the judges shouted an  uneven chorus.    \"Get down--the belt's yours\"--or words to that effect. It was  unofficial, that verdict, but it was unanimous and voiced with  enthusiasm.    Andy turned his head and smiled acknowledgment. \"All right--but wait  till I tame this hoss proper! Him and I've got a point to settle!\" He  dug in his spurs and again the battle raged, and again the crowd, not  having heard the unofficial decision, howled and yelled approval of  the spectacle.    Not till the roan gave up completely and owned obedience to rein and  voiced command, did Andy take further thought of the reward. He  satisfied himself beyond doubt that he was master and that the Weaver  recognized him as such. He wheeled and turned, \"cutting out\" an  imaginary animal from an imaginary herd; he loped and he walked,  stopped dead still in two jumps and started in one. He leaned and ran  his gloved hand forgivingly along the slatey blue neck, reached  farther and pulled facetiously the roan's ears, and the roan meekly  permitted the liberties. He half turned in the saddle and slapped the  plump hips, and the Weaver never moved. \"Why, you're an all-right  little hoss!\" praised Andy, slapping again and again.    The decision was being bellowed from the megaphone and Andy, hearing  it thus officially, trotted over to where a man was holding out the  belt that proclaimed him champion of the state. Andy reached out a  hand for the belt, buckled it around his middle and saluted the grand  stand as he used to do from the circus ring when one Andre de Greno  had performed his most difficult feat.    The Happy Family crowded up, shamefaced and manfully willing to own  themselves wrong.    \"We're down and ready to be walked on by the Champion,\" Weary  announced quizzically. \"Mama mine! but yuh sure can ride.\"    Andy looked at them, grinned and did an exceedingly foolish thing,  just to humiliate Happy Jack, who, he afterwards said, still looked  unconvinced. He coolly got upon his feet in the saddle, stood so while  he saluted the Happy Family mockingly, lighted the cigarette he had  just rolled, then, with another derisive salute, turned a double  somersault in the air and lighted upon his feet--and the roan did  nothing more belligerent than to turn his head and eye Andy  suspiciously.    \"By gracious, maybe you fellows'll some day own up yuh don't know it  all!\" he cried, and led the Weaver back into the corral and away from  the whooping maniacs across the track.           *       *       *       *       *          ANDY, THE LIAR      Andy Green licked a cigarette into shape the while he watched with  unfriendly eyes the shambling departure of their guest. \"I believe the  darned old reprobate was lyin' to us,\" he remarked, when the horseman  disappeared into a coulee.    \"You sure ought to be qualified to recognize the symptoms,\" grunted  Cal Emmett, kicking his foot out of somebody's carelessly coiled rope  on the ground. \"That your rope, Happy? No wonder you're always on the  bum for one. If you'd try tying it on your saddle--\"    \"Aw, g'wan. That there's Andy's rope--\"    \"If you look at my saddle, you'll find my rope right where it  belongs,\" Andy retorted. \"I ain't sheepherder enough to leave it  kicking around under foot. That rope belongs to his nibs that just  rode off. When he caught up his horse again after dinner, he throwed  his rope down while he saddled up, and then went off and forgot it. He  wasn't easy in his mind--that jasper wasn't. I don't go very high on  that hard-luck tale he told. I know the boy he had wolfing with him  last winter, and he wasn't the kind to pull out with all the stuff he  could get his hands on. He was an all-right fellow, and if there's  been any rusty work done down there in the breaks, this shifty-eyed  mark done it. He was lying--\"    Somebody laughed suddenly, and another chuckle helped to point the  joke, until the whole outfit was in an uproar; for of all the men who  had slept under Flying-U tents and eaten beside the mess-wagon, Andy  Green was conceded to be the greatest, the most shameless and wholly  incorrigible liar of the lot.    \"Aw, yuh don't want to get jealous of an old stiff like that,\" Pink  soothed musically. \"There ain't one of us but what knows you could lie  faster and farther and more of it in a minute, with your tongue  half-hitched around your palate and the deaf-and-dumb language barred,  than any three men in Chouteau County. Don't let it worry yuh, Andy.\"    \"I ain't letting it worry me,\" said Andy, getting a bit red with  trying not to show that the shot hit him. \"When my imagination gets to  soaring, I'm willing to bet all I got that it can fly higher than the  rest of you, that have got brains about on a par with a sage-hen, can  follow. When I let my fancy soar, I take notice the rest of yuh like  to set in the front row, all right--and yuh never, to my knowledge,  called it a punk show when the curtain rung down; yuh always got the  worth uh your money, and then some.    \"But if yuh'd taken notice of the load that old freak was trying to  throw into the bunch, you'd suspicion there was something scaley about  it; there was, all right. I'd gamble on it.\"    \"From the symptoms,\" spoke Weary mildly, rising to an elbow, \"Andy's  about to erupt one of those wide, hot, rushing streams of melted  imagination that bursts forth from his think-works ever so often.  Don't get us all worked up over it, Andy; what's it going to be this  time? A murder in the Bad-lands?\"    Andy clicked his teeth together, thought better of his ill-humor and  made reply, though he had intended to remain dignifiedly silent.    \"Yuh rung the bell, m'son--but it ain't any josh. By gracious, I mean  it!\" He glared at those who gurgled incredulously, and went on: \"No,  sir, you bet it ain't any josh with me _this_ time. That old gazabo  had something heavy on his conscience--and knowing the fellow he had  reference to, I sure believe he lied a whole lot when he said Dan  pulled out with all the stuff they'd got together, and went down  river. Maybe he went down river, all right--but if he did, it was most  likely to be face-down. Dan was as honest a boy as there is in the  country, and he had money on him that he got mining down in the little  Rockies last summer. I know, because he showed me the stuff last fall  when I met him in Benton, and he was fixing to winter with this fellow  that just left.    \"Dan was kinda queer about some things, and one of 'em was about  money. It never made any difference how much or how little he had, he  always packed it in his clothes; said a bank had busted on him once  and left him broke in the middle uh winter, and he wasn't going to let  it happen again. He never gambled none, nor blowed his money any  farther than a couple uh glasses uh beer once in a while. He was one  uh these saving cusses--but he was honest; I know that for a fact.    \"So he had all this money on him, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#20)"],[1,"but confusing book our survey must turn finally to  N.H. Wessely, who in 1782 for the first time maintained the importance  of the study of geography in Jewish school education. The works of the  past, with their consoling legends and hopes, continued to hold a place  in the heart of Jewish readers. But from Wessely's time onwards a long  series of Jewish explorers and travellers have joined the ranks of those  who have opened up for modern times a real knowledge of the globe.

The historical books to be found in the Bible, the Apocrypha, and the  Hellenistic literature prove that the Hebrew genius was not unfitted for  the presentation of the facts of Jewish life. These older works, as well  as the writings of Josephus, also show a faculty for placing local  records in relation to the wider facts of general history. After the  dispersion of the Jews, however, the local was the only history in which  the Jews could bear a part. The Jews read history as a mere commentary  on their own fate, and hence they were unable to take the wide outlook  into the world required for the compilation of objective histories.  Thus, in their aim to find religious consolation for their sufferings in  the Middle Ages, the Jewish historians sought rather to trace the hand  of Providence than to analyze the human causes of the changes in the  affairs of mankind.    But in another sense the Jews were essentially gifted with the  historical spirit. The great men of Israel were not local heroes. Just  as Plutarch's Lives were part of the history of the world's politics, so  Jewish biographies of learned men were part of the history of the  world's civilization. With the \"Order of the Tannaim and Amoraim\"  (written about the year 1100) begins a series of such biographical  works, in which more appreciation of sober fact is displayed than might  have been expected from the period. In the same way the famous Letter of  Sherira Gaon on the compilation of the Rabbinical literature (980)  marked great progress in the critical examination of historical  problems. Later works did not maintain the same level.    In the Middle Ages, Jewish histories mostly took the form of uncritical  Chronicles, which included legends and traditions as well as assured  facts. Their interest and importance lie in the personal and communal  details with which they abound. Sometimes they are confessedly local.  This is the case with the \"Chronicle of Achimaaz,\" written by him in  1055 in rhymed prose. In an entertaining style, he tells of the early  settlements of the Jews in Southern Italy, and throws much light on the  intercommunication between the scattered Jewish congregations of his  time. A larger canvas was filled by Abraham Ibn Daud, the physician and  philosopher who was born in Toledo in 1110, and met a martyr's end at  the age of seventy. His \"Book of Tradition\" (_Sefer ha-Kabbalah_),  written in 1161, was designed to present, in opposition to the Karaites,  the chain of Jewish tradition as a series of unbroken links from the  age of Moses to Ibn Baud's own times. Starting with the Creation, his  history ends with the anti-Karaitic crusade of Judah Ibn Ezra in Granada  (1150). Abraham Ibn Daud shows in this work considerable critical power,  but in his two other histories, one dealing with the history of Rome  from its foundation to the time of King Reccared in Spain, the other a  narrative of the history of the Jews during the Second Temple, the  author relied entirely on \"Josippon.\" This was a medieval concoction  which long passed as the original Josephus. \"Josippon\" was a romance  rather than a history. Culled from all sources, from Strabo, Lucian, and  Eusebius, as well as from Josephus, this marvellous book exercised  strong influence on the Jewish imagination, and supplied an antidote to  the tribulations of the present by the consolations of the past and the  vivid hopes for the future.    For a long period Abraham Ibn Daud found no imitators. Jewish history  was written as part of the Jewish religion. Yet, incidentally, many  historical passages were introduced in the works of Jewish scholars and  travellers, and the liturgy was enriched by many beautiful historical  Elegies, which were a constant call to heroism and fidelity. These  Elegies, or _Selichoth_, were composed throughout the Middle Ages, and  their passionate outpourings of lamentation and trust give them a high  place in Jewish poetry. They are also important historically, and fully  justify the fine utterance with which Zunz introduces them, an utterance  which was translated by George Eliot as follows:         If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of       all the nations--if the duration of sorrows and the patience       with which they are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the       aristocracy of every land--if a literature is called rich in       the possession of a few classic tragedies, what shall we say       to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years, in       which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?    The story of the medieval section of this pathetic martyrdom is written  in the _Selichoth_ and in the more prosaic records known as \"Memorial  Books\" (in German, _Memorbuecher_), which are lists of martyrs and brief  eulogies of their careers.    For the next formal history we must pass to Abraham Zacuto. In his old  age he employed some years of comparative quiet, after a stormy and  unhappy life, in writing a \"Book of Genealogies\" (_Yuchasin_). He had  been exiled from Spain in 1492, and twelve years later composed his  historical work in Tunis. Like Abraham Ibn Baud's book, it opens with  the Creation, and ends with the author's own day. Though Zacuto's work  is more celebrated than historical, it nevertheless had an important  share in reawaking the dormant interest of Jews in historical research.  Thus we find Elijah Kapsali of Candia writing, in 1523, a \"History of  the Ottoman Empire,\" and Joseph Cohen, of Avignon, a \"History of France  and Turkey,\" in 1554, in which he included an account of the rebellion  of Fiesco in Genoa, where the author was then residing.    The sixteenth century witnessed the production of several popular Jewish  histories. At that epoch the horizon of the world was extending under  new geographical and intellectual discoveries. Israel, on the other  hand, seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper into the slough of despond.  Some of the men who had themselves been the victims of persecution saw  that the only hope lay in rousing the historical consciousness of their  brethren. History became the consolation of the exiles from Spain who  found themselves pent up within the walls of the Ghettos, which were  first built in the sixteenth century. Samuel Usque was a fugitive from  the Inquisition, and his dialogues, \"Consolations for the Tribulations  of Israel\" (written in Portuguese, in 1553), are a long drawn-out sigh  of pain passing into a sigh of relief. Usque opens with a passionate  idyl in which the history of Israel in the near past is told by the  shepherd Icabo. To him Numeo and Zicareo offer consolation, and they  pour balm into his wounded heart. The vividness of Usque's style, his  historical insight, his sturdy optimism, his poetical force in  interpreting suffering as the means of attaining the highest life in  God, raise his book above the other works of its class and age.    Usque's poem did not win the same popularity as two other elegiac  histories of the same period. These were the \"Rod of Judah\" (_Shebet  Jehudah_) and the \"Valley of Tears\" (_Emek ha-Bachah_). The former was  the work of three generations of the Ibn Verga family. Judah died before  the expulsion from Spain, but his son Solomon participated in the final  troubles of the Spanish Jews, and was even forced to join the ranks of  the Marranos. The grandson, Joseph Ibn Verga, became Rabbi in  Adrianople, and was cultured in classical as well as Jewish lore. Their  composite work, \"The Rod of Judah,\" was completed in 1554. It is a  well-written but badly arranged martyrology, and over all its pages  might be inscribed the Talmudical motto, that God's chastisements of  Israel are chastisements of love. The other work referred to is Joseph  Cohen's \"Valley of Tears,\" completed in 1575. The author was born in  Avignon in 1496, four years after his father had shared in the exile  from Spain. He himself suffered expatriation, for, though a  distinguished physician and the private doctor of the Doge Andrea Doria,  he was expelled with the rest of the Jews from Genoa in 1550. Settled in  the little town of Voltaggio, he devoted himself to writing the annals  of European and Jewish history. His style is clear and forcible, and  recalls the lucid simplicity of the historical books of the Bible.    The only other histories that need be critically mentioned here are the  \"Branch of David\" (_Zemach David_), the \"Chain of Tradition\"  (_Shalsheleth ha-Kabbalah_), and the \"Light of the Eyes\" (_Meoer  Enayim_).
