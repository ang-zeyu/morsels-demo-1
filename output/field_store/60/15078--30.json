But Drake did the trick  without one, to the utter dismay of the Spaniards. After some more very  clever manoeuvres, to distract the enemy's attention from the real point  of attack, Carleill and the soldiers landed under cover of the dark and  came upon the town where they were least expected, by wading waist-deep  through the water just out of sight of the Spanish gunners. The  entrenchments did not bar the way in this unexpected quarter. But wine  casks full of rammed earth had been hurriedly piled there in case the  mad English should make the attempt. Carleill gave the signal. Goring's  musketeers sprang forward and fired into the Spaniards' faces. Then  Sampson's pikemen charged through and a desperate hand-to-hand fight  ensued. Finally the Spaniards broke after Carleill had killed their  standard-bearer and Goring had wounded and taken their commander. The  enemies ran pell-mell through the town together till the English  reformed in the Plaza. Next day Drake moved in to attack the harbor  fort; whereupon it was abandoned and the whole place fell.    But again there was a dearth of booty. The Spaniards were getting shy of  keeping too many valuables where they could be taken. So negotiations,  emphasized by piecemeal destruction, went on till sickness and the  lateness of the season put the English in a sorry fix. The sack of the  city had yielded much less than that of San Domingo; and the men, who  were all volunteers, to be paid out of plunder, began to grumble at  their ill-success. Many had been wounded, several killed--big, faithful  Tom Moone among them. A hundred died. More were ill. Two councils of war  were held, one naval, the other military. The military officers agreed  to give up all their own shares to the men. But the naval officers, who  were poorer and who were also responsible for the expenses of their  vessels, could not concur. Finally 110,000 ducats (equivalent in  purchasing power to nearly three millions of dollars) were accepted.    It was now impossible to complete the programme or even to take Havana,  in view of the renewed sickness, the losses, and the advance of the  season. A further disappointment was experienced when Drake just missed  the treasure fleet by only half a day, though through no fault of his  own. Then, with constantly diminishing numbers of effective men, the  course was shaped for the Spanish 'plantation' of St. Augustine in  Florida. This place was utterly destroyed and some guns and money were  taken from it. Then the fleet stood north again till, on the 9th of  June, it found Raleigh's colony of Roanoke.    Ralph Lane, the governor, was in his fort on the island ready to brave  it out. Drake offered a free passage home to all the colonists. But Lane  preferred staying and going on with his surveys and 'plantation.' Drake  then filled up a store ship to leave behind with Lane. But a terrific  three-day storm wrecked the store ship and damped the colonists'  enthusiasm so much that they persuaded Lane to change his mind. The  colonists embarked and the fleet then bore away for home. Though balked  of much it had expected in the way of booty, reduced in strength by  losses, and therefore unable to garrison any strategic point which would  threaten the life of New Spain, its purely naval work was a true and  glorious success. When he arrived at Plymouth, Drake wrote immediately  to Burleigh: 'My very good Lord, there is now a very great gap opened,  very little to the liking of the King of Spain.'    This 'very great gap' on the American side of the Atlantic was soon to  be matched by the still greater gap Drake was to make on the European  side by destroying the Spanish Armada and thus securing that mightiest  of ocean highways through which the hosts of emigration afterwards  poured into a land endowed with the goodly heritage of English liberty  and the English tongue.      The year of Drake's return (1586) was no less troublous than its  immediate predecessors. The discovery of the Babington Plot to  assassinate Elizabeth and to place Mary on the throne, supported by  Scotland, France, and Spain, proved Mary's complicity, produced an  actual threat of war from France, and made the Pope and Philip gnash  their teeth with rage. The Roman Catholic allied powers had no  sufficient navy, and Philip's credit was at its lowest ebb after Drake's  devastating raid. The English were exultant, east and west; for the  _True Report of a Worthie Fight performed in the voiage from Turkie by  Five Shippes of London against 11 gallies and two frigats of the King of  Spain at Pantalarea, within the Straits_ [of Gibraltar] _Anno 1586_ was  going the rounds and running a close second to Drake's West India  achievement. The ignorant and thoughtless, both then and since, mistook  this fight, and another like it in 1590, to mean that English  merchantmen could beat off Spanish men-of-war. Nothing of the kind: the  English Levanters were heavily armed and admirably manned by  well-trained fighting crews; and what these actions really proved, if  proof was necessary, was that galleys were no match for broadsides from  the proper kind of sailing ships.    Turkey came into the problems of 1586 in more than name, for there was a  vast diplomatic scheme on foot to unite the Turks with such Portuguese  as would support Antonio, the pretender to the throne of Portugal, and  the rebellious Dutch against Spain, Catholic France, and Mary Stuart's  Scotland. Leicester was in the Netherlands with an English army,  fighting indecisively, losing Sir Philip Sidney and angering Elizabeth  by accepting the governor-generalship without her leave and against her  diplomacy, which, now as ever, was opposed to any definite avowal that  could possibly be helped.    Meanwhile the Great Armada was working up its strength, and Drake was  commissioned to weaken it as much as possible. But, on the 8th of  February, 1587, before he could sail, Mary was at last beheaded, and  Elizabeth was once more entering on a tricky course of tortuous  diplomacy too long by half to follow here. As the great crisis  approached, it had become clearer and clearer that it was a case of kill  or be killed between Elizabeth and Mary, and that England could not  afford to leave Marian enemies in the rear when there might be a vast  Catholic alliance in the front. But, as a sovereign, Elizabeth disliked  the execution of any crowned head; as a wily woman she wanted to make  the most of both sides; and as a diplomatist she would not have open war  and direct operations going down to the root of the evil if devious ways  would do.    So the peace party of the Council prevailed again, and Drake's orders  were changed. He had been going as a lion. The peace party now tried to  send him as a fox. But he stretched his instructions to their utmost  limits and even defied the custom of the service by holding no council  of war when deciding to swoop on Cadiz.    As they entered the harbor, the English saw sixty ships engaged in  preparations for the Great Armada. Many had no sails--to keep the crews  from deserting. Others were waiting for their guns to come from Italy.  Ten galleys rowed out to protect them. The weather and surroundings were  perfect for these galleys. But as they came end-on in line-abreast Drake  crossed their T in line-ahead with the shattering broadsides of four  Queen's ships which soon sent them flying. Each galley was the upright  of the T, each English sailing ship the corresponding crosspiece. Then  Drake attacked the shipping and wrecked it right and left. Next morning  he led the pinnaces and boats into the inner harbor, where they cut out  the big galleon belonging to Santa Cruz himself, the Spanish  commander-in-chief. Then the galleys got their chance again--an  absolutely perfect chance, because Drake's fleet was becalmed at the  very worst possible place for sailing ships and the very best possible  place for the well-oared galleys. But even under these extraordinary  circumstances the ships smashed the galleys up with broadside fire and  sent them back to cover. Then the Spaniards towed some fire-ships out.  But the English rowed for them, threw grappling irons into them, and  gave them a turn that took them clear. Then, for the last time, the  galleys came on, as bravely but as uselessly as ever. When Drake sailed  away he left the shipping of Cadiz completely out of action for months  to come, though fifteen sail escaped destruction in the inner harbor.  His own losses were quite insignificant.    The next objective was Cape St. Vincent, so famous through centuries of  naval history because it is the great strategic salient thrust out into  the Atlantic from the southwest corner of Europe, and thus commands the  flank approaches to and from the Mediterranean, to and from the coast of  Africa, and, in those days, the route to and from New Spain by way of  the Azores. Here Drake had trouble with Borough, his second-in-command,  a friend of cautious Burleigh and a man hide-bound in the warfare of the  past--a sort of English Don. Borough objected to Drake's taking decisive  action without the vote of a council of war. Remembering the terrors of  Italian textbooks, he had continued to regard the galleys with much  respect in the harbor of Cadiz even after Drake had broken them with  ease. Finally, still clinging to the old ways of mere raids and  reprisals, he stood aghast at the idea of seizing Cape St. Vincent and  making it a base of operations. Drake promptly put him under arrest.    Sagres Castle, commanding the roadstead of Cape St. Vincent, was  extraordinarily strong. The cliffs, on which it occupied about a  hundred acres, rose sheer two hundred feet all round except at a narrow  and well defended neck only two hundred yards across. Drake led the  stormers himself. While half his eight hundred men kept up a continuous  fire"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#20)"],[1," been  directed to this generation for the pastime of idle ears and eyes, but  I desire at last to know--even as every one who is like-minded should  know--whether there is anything outside us that is akin to our type  of thought. Every German who still believes that he is a member of a  nation, who thinks of it in grand and noble fashion, who hopes in it,  and who dares, suffers, and endures for it, should at last be torn  from the uncertainty of his belief; he should clearly discern whether  he is right or whether he is only a fool and a fanatic; henceforth he  should either continue his path with sure and joyous consciousness,  or, with healthy resolution, should renounce a fatherland here below  and comfort himself solely with that which is in heaven. To you,  therefore, not as such-and-such persons in our daily and circumscribed  life, but as representatives of the nation, and, through your ears, to  the nation as a whole, these addresses appeal.    Centuries have passed since you have been convened as you are  today--in such numbers, in so great, so insistent, so mutual an  interest, so absolutely as a nation and as Germans. Never again will  you be so bidden. If you do not listen now and examine yourselves, if  you again let these addresses pass you by as an empty tickling of the  ears or as a strange prodigy, no human being will longer take account  of you. Hear at last for once; for once at last reflect! Only do not  go this time from the spot without having made a firm resolve; let  every one who hears this voice make this resolution within himself  and for himself, even as though he were alone and must do everything  alone. If very many individuals think thus, there will soon be a great  whole uniting into a single, close-knit power. If, on the contrary,  each one, excluding himself, relies on the rest and relinquishes the  affair to others, then there are no others at all, for, even though  combined, all remain just as they were before. Make it on the  spot--this resolution! Do not say, \"Yet a little more sleep, a  little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,\" until,  perchance, improvement shall come of itself. It will never come of  itself. He who has once missed the opportunity of yesterday, when  clear perception would have been easier, will not be able to make  up his mind today, and will certainly be even less able to do so  tomorrow. Every delay only makes us still more inert and but lulls us  more and more into gentle acquiescence to our wretched plight. Neither  could the external stimulations to reflection ever be stronger and  more insistent, for surely he whom these present conditions do not  arouse has lost all feeling. You have been called together to make  a last, determined resolution and decision--not by any means to give  commands and mandates to others, or to depute others to do the work  for you. No, my purpose is to urge you to do the work yourself. In  this connection that idle passing of resolutions, the will to will,  some time or other, are not sufficient, nor is it enough to remain  sluggishly satisfied until self-improvement sets in of its own  accord. On the contrary, from you is demanded a determination which  is identical with action and with life itself, and which will continue  and control, unwavering and unchilled, until it gains its goal.    Or is perchance the root, from which alone can grow a tenacity of  purpose which takes hold upon life, utterly eradicated and vanished  within you? Or is your whole being actually rarefied into a hollow  shade, devoid of sap and blood and of individual power of movement, or  dissolved to a dream in which, indeed, a motley array of faces arise  and busily cross one another, but the body lies stiff and dead? Long  since it has been openly proclaimed to our generation and repeated  under every guise, that this is very nearly its condition. Its  spokesmen have believed that this was declared merely in insult, and  have regarded themselves as challenged to return the insults, thinking  that thus the affair would resume its natural course. As for the rest,  there was not the slightest trace of change or of improvement. If  you have heard this, and if it was capable of rousing your  indignation--well then, through your very actions, give the lie to  those who thus think and speak of you. Once show yourselves to be  different before the eyes of all the world, and before the eyes of all  the world they will be convicted of their falsehood. It may be that  they have spoken thus harshly of you with the precise intention of  forcing this refutation from you, and because they despaired of any  other means of arousing you. How much better, then, would have been  their intentions toward you than were the purposes of those who  flattered you that you might be kept in sluggish calm and in careless  thoughtlessness!    However weak and powerless you may be, during this period clear and  calm reflection has been vouchsafed you as never before. What  really plunged us into confusion regarding our position, into  thoughtlessness, into a blind way of letting things go, was our sweet  complacency with ourselves and our mode of existence. Things had thus  gone on hitherto, and so they continued and would continue to go. If  any one challenged us to reflect, we triumphantly showed him, instead  of any other refutation, our continued existence which went on without  any thought or effort on our part; yet things flowed along simply  because we were not put to the test. Since that time we have passed  through the ordeal and it might be supposed that the deceptions, the  delusions, and the false consolations with which we all misguided one  another would have collapsed! The innate prejudices which, without  proceeding from this point or from that, spread over all like a  natural cloud and wrapped all in the same mist, ought surely, by this  time, to have utterly vanished! That twilight no longer obscures our  eyes, and can therefore no longer serve for an excuse. Now we stand,  naked and bare, stripped of all alien coverings and draperies, simply  as ourselves. Now it must appear what each self is, or is not.    Some one among you might come forward and ask me \"What gives you in  particular, the only one among all German men and authors, the special  task, vocation, and prerogative of convening us and inveighing against  us? Would not any one among the thousands of the writers of Germany  have exactly the same right to do this as you have? None of them does  it; you alone push yourself forward.\" I answer that each one would,  indeed, have had the same right as I, and that I do it for the very  reason that no one among them has done it before me; that I would be  silent if any one else had spoken previous to me. This was the first  step toward the goal of a radical amelioration, and some one must take  it. I seemed to be the first vividly to perceive this--accordingly, it  was I who first took it. After this, a second step will be taken, and  thereto every one has now the same right; but, as a matter of fact,  it, in its turn, will be taken by but one individual. One man must  always be the first, and let him be he who can!    Without anxiety regarding this circumstance, let your attention rest  for an instant on the consideration to which we have previously led  you--in how enviable a position Germany and the world would be if the  former had known how to utilize the good fortune of her position and  to recognize her advantage. Let your eyes rest upon what they both  are now, and let your minds be penetrated by the pain and indignation  which, in this reflection, must lay hold upon every noble soul. Then  examine yourselves and see that it is you who can release the age from  the errors of ancient times, and that, if only you will permit it,  your own eyes can be cleared of the mist that covers them; learn, too,  that it has been vouchsafed to you, as to no generation before you, to  undo what has been done and to efface the dishonorable interval from  the annals of the German nation.    Let the various conditions among which you must choose pass before  you. If you drift along in your torpor and your heedlessness, all the  evils of slavery await you--deprivations, humiliations, the scorn and  arrogance of the conqueror; you will be pushed about from pillar to  post, because you have never found your proper niche, until, through  the sacrifice of your nationality and of your language, you slip into  some subordinate place where your nation shall sink its identity. If,  on the other hand, you rouse yourselves, you will find, first of all,  an enduring and honorable existence, and will behold a flourishing  generation which promises to you and to the Germans the most glorious  and lasting memory. Through the instrumentality of this new generation  you will see in spirit the German name exalted to the most glorious  among all nations; you will discern in this nation the regenerator and  restorer of the world.    It depends upon you whether you will be the last of a dishonorable  race, even more surely despised by posterity than it deserves, and in  whose history--if there can be any history in the barbarism which will  then begin--succeeding generations will rejoice when it perishes and  will praise fate that it is just; or whether you will be the beginning  and the point of development of a new age which will be glorious  beyond all your expectations, and become those from whom posterity  will date the year of their salvation. Bethink yourselves that you  are the last in whose power this great change lies. You have heard  the Germans called a unit; you have still a visible sign of their  unity--an Empire and an Imperial League--or you have heard of it;  among you even yet, from time to time, voices have been audible which  were inspired by this higher patriotism. After you become accustomed  to other concepts and will accept alien forms and "]]]
