The  rapidity with which the facts of an appearance can be noted makes it  above all others the method for drapery studies. The lights are drawn  with white, the toned paper being allowed to show through where a darker  tone is needed, the white (either chalk or Chinese white) being put on  thickly when a bright light is wanted and thinly where a quieter light  is needed. So with the shadows, the chalk is put on heavily in the darks  and less heavily in the lighter shadows. Since the days of the early  Italians this has been a favourite method of drawing drapery studies  (see illustrations, page 260 [Transcribers Note: Plate LIV]).    Some artists have shaded their lights with gold and silver paint. The  late Sir Edward Burne-Jones was very fond of this, and drawings with  much decorative charm have been done this way. The principle is the same  as in drawing with white chalk, the half tone being given by the paper.    Keep the lights separate from the shadows, let the half tone paper  always come as a buffer state between them. Get as much information into  the drawing of your lights and shadows as possible; don't be satisfied  with a smudge effect. Use the side of your white chalk when you want a  mass, or work in parallel lines (hatching) on the principle described in  the chapter on line drawing.          X    RHYTHM      The subject of Rhythm in what are called the Fine Arts is so vague, and  has received so little attention, that some courage, or perhaps  foolhardiness, is needed to attack it. And in offering the following  fragmentary ideas that have been stumbled on in my own limited practice,  I want them to be accepted only for what they are worth, as I do not  know of any proper authority for them. But they may serve as a stimulus,  and offer some lines on which the student can pursue the subject for  himself.    The word rhythm is here used to signify the power possessed by lines,  tones, and colours, by their ordering and arrangement, to affect us,  somewhat as different notes and combinations of sound do in music. And  just as in music, where sounds affect us without having any direct  relation with nature, but appeal directly to our own inner life; so in  painting, sculpture, and architecture #there is a music that appeals  directly to us apart from any significance that may be associated with  the representation of natural phenomena#. There is, as it were, an  abstract music of line, tone, and colour.    The danger of the naturalistic movement in painting in the nineteenth  century has been that it has turned our attention away from this  fundamental fact of art to the contemplation of interesting  realisations of appearances--realisations often full of poetic  suggestiveness due to associations connected with the objects painted as  concrete things, but not always made directly significant as artistic  expression; whereas #it is the business of the artist to relate the  form, colour, and tone of natural appearances to this abstract musical  quality, with which he should never lose touch even in the most highly  realised detail of his work#. For only thus, when related to rhythm, do  the form, tone, and colour of appearances obtain their full expressive  power and become a means of vitally conveying the feeling of the artist.    Inquiry as to the origin of this power and of rhythm generally is a  profoundly interesting subject; and now that recent advances in science  tend to show that sound, heat, light, and possibly electricity and even  nerve force are but different rhythmic forms of energy, and that matter  itself may possibly be resolved eventually into different rhythmic  motions, it does look as if rhythm may yet be found to contain even the  secret of life itself. At any rate it is very intimately associated with  life; and primitive man early began to give expression in some form of  architecture, sculpture, or painting to the deeper feelings that were  moving him; found some correspondence between the lines and colours of  architecture, sculpture, and painting and the emotional life that was  awakening within him. Thus, looking back at the remains of their work  that have come down to us, we are enabled to judge of the nature of the  people from the expression we find in hewn stone and on painted walls.    It is in primitive art generally that we see more clearly the direct  emotional significance of line and form. Art appears to have developed  from its most abstract position, to which bit by bit have been added the  truths and graces of natural appearance, until as much of this  naturalistic truth has been added as the abstract significance at the  base of the expression could stand without loss of power. At this point,  as has already been explained, a school is at the height of its  development. The work after this usually shows an increased concern with  naturalistic truth, which is always very popular, to the gradual  exclusion of the backbone of abstract line and form significance that  dominated the earlier work. And when these primitive conditions are lost  touch with, a decadence sets in. At least, this is roughly the theory to  which a study of the two great art developments of the past, in Greece  and Italy, would seem to point. And this theory is the excuse for all  the attempts at primitivism of which we have lately seen so much.    Art having lost touch with its primitive base owing to the over-doses of  naturalism it has had, we must, these new apostles say, find a new  primitive base on which to build the new structure of art. The theory  has its attractions, but there is this difference between the primitive  archaic Greek or early Italian and the modern primitive; the early men  reverently clothed the abstract idea they started with in the most  natural and beautiful form within their knowledge, ever seeking to  discover new truths and graces from nature to enrich their work; while  the modern artist, with the art treasures of all periods of the world  before him, can never be in the position of these simple-minded men. It  is therefore unlikely that the future development of art will be on  lines similar to that of the past. The same conditions of simple  ignorance are never likely to occur again. Means of communication and  prolific reproduction make it very unlikely that the art of the world  will again be lost for a season, as was Greek art in the Middle Ages.  Interesting intellectually as is the theory that the impressionist point  of view (the accepting of the flat retina picture as a pattern of colour  sensations) offers a new field from which to select material for a new  basis of artistic expression, so far the evidence of results has not  shown anything likely seriously to threaten the established principles  of traditional design. And anything more different in spirit from the  genuine primitive than the irreverent anarchy and flouting of all  refinement in the work of some of these new primitives, it would be  difficult to imagine. But much of the work of the movement has undoubted  artistic vitality, and in its insistence on design and selection should  do much to kill \"realism\" and the \"copying nature\" theory of a few years  back.    Although it is perfectly true that the feelings and ideas that impel the  artist may sooner or later find their own expression, there are a great  many principles connected with the arranging of lines, tones, and  colours in his picture that it is difficult to transgress without  calamity. At any rate the knowledge of some of them will aid the artist  in gaining experience, and possibly save him some needless fumbling.    But don't for one moment think that anything in the nature of rules is  going to take the place of the initial artistic impulse which must come  from within. This is not a matter for teaching, art training being only  concerned with perfecting the means of its expression.    [Illustration: Plate XXX.    A STUDY FOR A PICTURE OF \"ROSALIND AND ORLANDO\"    _Ros._ \"He calls us back; my pride fell with my fortunes.\"]    It is proposed to treat the subject from the material side of line and  tone only, without any reference to subject matter, with the idea of  trying to find out something about the expressive qualities line and  tone are capable of yielding unassociated with visual things. What use  can be made of any such knowledge to give expression to the emotional  life of the artist is not our concern, and is obviously a matter for the  individual to decide for himself.           *       *       *       *       *    There is at the basis of every picture a structure of lines and masses.  They may not be very obvious, and may be hidden under the most broken of  techniques, but they will always be found underlying the planning of any  painting. Some may say that the lines are only the boundaries of the  masses, and others that the masses are only the spaces between the  lines. But whichever way you care to look at it, there are particular  emotional qualities analogous to music that affect us in lines and line  arrangements and also in tone or mass arrangements. And any power a  picture may have to move us will be largely due to the rhythmic  significance of this original planning. These qualities, as has already  been stated, affect us quite apart from any association they may have  with natural things: arrangements of mere geometrical lines are  sufficient to suggest them. But of course other associations connected  with the objects represented will largely augment the impression, when  the line and tone arrangements and the sentiment of the object are in  sympathy. And if they are not, it may happen that associations connected  with the representation will cut in and obscure or entirely destroy this  line and tone music. That is to say, if the line and tone arrangement  in the abstract is expressive of the sublime, and the objects whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#20)"],[1,"  It was cold in the street. There was a wind like ice. People went  flitting by, very fast; the men walked like scissors; the women trod  like cats. And nobody knew--nobody cared. Even if she broke down, if at  last, after all these years, she were to cry, she'd find herself in the  lock-up as like as not.    But at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in  his gran's arms. Ah, that's what she wants to do, my dove. Gran wants  to cry. If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over everything,  beginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on to the  doctor's, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband, the  children's leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to  Lennie. But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a  long time. All the same, the time for it had come. She must do it. She  couldn't put it off any longer; she couldn't wait any more... Where could  she go?    \"She's had a hard life, has Ma Parker.\" Yes, a hard life, indeed! Her  chin began to tremble; there was no time to lose. But where? Where?    She couldn't go home; Ethel was there. It would frighten Ethel out  of her life. She couldn't sit on a bench anywhere; people would come  arsking her questions. She couldn't possibly go back to the gentleman's  flat; she had no right to cry in strangers' houses. If she sat on some  steps a policeman would speak to her.    Oh, wasn't there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to  herself and stay as long as she liked, not disturbing anybody, and  nobody worrying her? Wasn't there anywhere in the world where she could  have her cry out--at last?    Ma Parker stood, looking up and down. The icy wind blew out her apron  into a balloon. And now it began to rain. There was nowhere.          7. MARRIAGE A LA MODE.    On his way to the station William remembered with a fresh pang of  disappointment that he was taking nothing down to the kiddies. Poor  little chaps! It was hard lines on them. Their first words always were  as they ran to greet him, \"What have you got for me, daddy?\" and he had  nothing. He would have to buy them some sweets at the station. But that  was what he had done for the past four Saturdays; their faces had fallen  last time when they saw the same old boxes produced again.    And Paddy had said, \"I had red ribbing on mine bee-fore!\"    And Johnny had said, \"It's always pink on mine. I hate pink.\"    But what was William to do? The affair wasn't so easily settled. In the  old days, of course, he would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop  and chosen them something in five minutes. But nowadays they had Russian  toys, French toys, Serbian toys--toys from God knows where. It was over  a year since Isabel had scrapped the old donkeys and engines and so on  because they were so \"dreadfully sentimental\" and \"so appallingly bad  for the babies' sense of form.\"    \"It's so important,\" the new Isabel had explained, \"that they should  like the right things from the very beginning. It saves so much time  later on. Really, if the poor pets have to spend their infant years  staring at these horrors, one can imagine them growing up and asking to  be taken to the Royal Academy.\"    And she spoke as though a visit to the Royal Academy was certain  immediate death to any one...    \"Well, I don't know,\" said William slowly. \"When I was their age I used  to go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it.\"    The new Isabel looked at him, her eyes narrowed, her lips apart.    \"Dear William! I'm sure you did!\" She laughed in the new way.    Sweets it would have to be, however, thought William gloomily, fishing  in his pocket for change for the taxi-man. And he saw the kiddies  handing the boxes round--they were awfully generous little chaps--while  Isabel's precious friends didn't hesitate to help themselves...    What about fruit? William hovered before a stall just inside the  station. What about a melon each? Would they have to share that, too?  Or a pineapple, for Pad, and a melon for Johnny? Isabel's friends could  hardly go sneaking up to the nursery at the children's meal-times. All  the same, as he bought the melon William had a horrible vision of one  of Isabel's young poets lapping up a slice, for some reason, behind the  nursery door.    With his two very awkward parcels he strode off to his train. The  platform was crowded, the train was in. Doors banged open and shut.  There came such a loud hissing from the engine that people looked dazed  as they scurried to and fro. William made straight for a first-class  smoker, stowed away his suit-case and parcels, and taking a huge wad of  papers out of his inner pocket, he flung down in the corner and began to  read.    \"Our client moreover is positive... We are inclined to reconsider... in  the event of--\" Ah, that was better. William pressed back his flattened  hair and stretched his legs across the carriage floor. The familiar dull  gnawing in his breast quietened down. \"With regard to our decision--\" He  took out a blue pencil and scored a paragraph slowly.    Two men came in, stepped across him, and made for the farther corner. A  young fellow swung his golf clubs into the rack and sat down opposite.  The train gave a gentle lurch, they were off. William glanced up and saw  the hot, bright station slipping away. A red-faced girl raced along by  the carriages, there was something strained and almost desperate in the  way she waved and called. \"Hysterical!\" thought William dully. Then a  greasy, black-faced workman at the end of the platform grinned at the  passing train. And William thought, \"A filthy life!\" and went back to  his papers.    When he looked up again there were fields, and beasts standing for  shelter under the dark trees. A wide river, with naked children  splashing in the shallows, glided into sight and was gone again. The sky  shone pale, and one bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel.    \"We have examined our client's correspondence files... \" The last  sentence he had read echoed in his mind. \"We have examined... \" William  hung on to that sentence, but it was no good; it snapped in the  middle, and the fields, the sky, the sailing bird, the water, all said,  \"Isabel.\" The same thing happened every Saturday afternoon. When he  was on his way to meet Isabel there began those countless imaginary  meetings. She was at the station, standing just a little apart from  everybody else; she was sitting in the open taxi outside; she was at  the garden gate; walking across the parched grass; at the door, or just  inside the hall.    And her clear, light voice said, \"It's William,\" or \"Hillo, William!\" or  \"So William has come!\" He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek.    The exquisite freshness of Isabel! When he had been a little boy, it was  his delight to run into the garden after a shower of rain and shake the  rose-bush over him. Isabel was that rose-bush, petal-soft, sparkling and  cool. And he was still that little boy. But there was no running into  the garden now, no laughing and shaking. The dull, persistent gnawing in  his breast started again. He drew up his legs, tossed the papers aside,  and shut his eyes.    \"What is it, Isabel? What is it?\" he said tenderly. They were in their  bedroom in the new house. Isabel sat on a painted stool before the  dressing-table that was strewn with little black and green boxes.    \"What is what, William?\" And she bent forward, and her fine light hair  fell over her cheeks.    \"Ah, you know!\" He stood in the middle of the room and he felt a  stranger. At that Isabel wheeled round quickly and faced him.    \"Oh, William!\" she cried imploringly, and she held up the hair-brush:  \"Please! Please don't be so dreadfully stuffy and--tragic. You're always  saying or looking or hinting that I've changed. Just because I've got to  know really congenial people, and go about more, and am frightfully keen  on--on everything, you behave as though I'd--\" Isabel tossed back  her hair and laughed--\"killed our love or something. It's so awfully  absurd\"--she bit her lip--\"and it's so maddening, William. Even this new  house and the servants you grudge me.\"    \"Isabel!\"    \"Yes, yes, it's true in a way,\" said Isabel quickly. \"You think they are  another bad sign. Oh, I know you do. I feel it,\" she said softly, \"every  time you come up the stairs. But we couldn't have gone on living in  that other poky little hole, William. Be practical, at least! Why, there  wasn't enough room for the babies even.\"    No, it was true. Every morning when he came back from chambers it was to  find the babies with Isabel in the back drawing-room. They were having  rides on the leopard skin thrown over the sofa back, or they were  playing shops with Isabel's desk for a counter, or Pad was sitting on  the hearthrug rowing away for dear life with a little brass fire shovel,  while Johnny shot at pirates with the tongs. Every evening they each had  a pick-a-back up the narrow stairs to their fat old Nanny.    Yes, he supposed it was a poky little house. A little white house with  blue curtains and a window-box of petunias. William met their friends at  the door with \"Seen our petunias? Pretty terrific for London, don't you  think?\"    But the imbecile thing, the absolutely extraordinary thing was that he  hadn't the slightest idea that Isabel wasn't as happy as he. God, what  blindness! He hadn't the remotest notion in those days that she really  hated that inconvenient little house, that she thought the fat Nanny  was ruining the babies, that she was desperately lonely, pining for new  people and new music and pictures and so on. If they hadn't gone to that  studio party at Moira Morrison's--if Moira Morrison hadn't said as they  were leaving, \"I'm going to rescue your wife, selfish man. She's like  an exquisite little Titania\"--if Isabel hadn't gone with Moira to  Paris--if--if...    The train stopped at another station. Bettingford."]]]
