The  other hand, outstretched, palm uppermost, held between the curling  beckoning fingers tatters of the veil which, blown by the wind, twined  about the slender limbs and outlined the ribbed ridges of the body thin  to gauntness.    And even as she looked, the hummock showed empty, whilst, half-turned,  upon tips of slender feet, with beckoning hand, he stood a mile off,  perchance more, this youth of crimson, laughing mouth and haunting eyes.    One with the silver-grey and purple of the night, one with the gold and  crimson of the coming day, he drew her, whilst the breeze laughed over  her head and, soughed faintly in her ears, so that she strove to ride  him down, only to find that he was not there; and urged the great beast  further still and at his greatest speed, to see the figure ever out of  reach, with beckoning hand; and little mocking laugh.    And then, with hoofs clattering in the shining bones of some long-dead  fugitive who had failed to reach the oasis, the stallion reared and  wheeled, and, caring naught for the hand upon the reins and with the  bit between his teeth, raced back upon his tracks, leaving the Spirit  of the Desert wrapped to the eyes in tattered misty veil.    Take heed!    So matter at what hour of the day you meet him; be it at the hour of  noon, when the scorpion basks blissfully in the scorching sun; be it at  night, when the white fingers of the moon essay to close your eyes in  the sleep that perchance may have no waking; or at dawn, when heart or  soul, or whatever it be, is like unto running water in its strength,  beware of that gaunt figure with crimson laughing mouth.    Men bewitched as with woman have followed; women bewitched as with man  have followed.  You will find their bones if you go far enough or dig  deep enough; and leave yours to bleach with theirs if you have not  strength to resist.    Beasts see it not at all.    So that through a certain unromantic yearning for oats under his  loosening girth, the stallion Sooltan raced Damaris back to the _sayis_  and safety.    She had not understood the import of the apparition in the desert any  more than she perceived the figure of a man standing amongst the ruins,  watching her.    Hugh Carden Ali knew that it was her last ride; the last time she would  feed the stallion with sugar; her last day amongst the ruins of the  City of On.    The blood of his fathers, even that of the men who had swept the desert  for their women, warred with the blood of his mother of a gentler  breed; so that, fearing the strength of the one or the weakness of the  other, he had sacrificed the last ride to the love in his heart.          CHAPTER XVII      \"The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten-score in martial state    Of valiant men with steeds and cars march through each massy gate.\"      There was no moon to break the shadows in the Great Hypostyle Hall of  the Temple of Amnon; neither was there sound or sign of life, the  winter residents and bird-of-passage tourists being duly occupied in  the festivities which are the order of the night in hotel life on the  Nile.    It is not actually dangerous, nor is it actually wise, to visit the  stupendous ruins of Egypt alone at night.  The native has far too good  an eye to business to lurk behind obelisk or column with intent to  spring out and demand the purse of any stray unit of the cosmopolitan  hordes which bring such wealth in the winter months to the land of the  Pharaohs.    Rather not!  Far greater joy for him at full noon is palming off upon  your guileless self the spurious scarab at a price 300% above its  intrinsic worth.    Incidents of that kind do not occur in the great tourist  centres--though worse, far worse happens to the foolhardy or  featherheaded in the by-paths and hidden corners of this mysterious  land--but if you have the vision, the terrible silence of the Past, the  supreme indifference of the great ruins to the passage of Time, the  wonderful repose of the mighty blocks of stone piled in the days of the  great Pharaohs, are apt to give a thrill to your heart and an  impression to your mind which may last a lifetime.    If you have not the vision you need not worry, for you will not want to  wander from the hotel lounge after your coffee to traverse these  ancient wastes.    Damaris had spent the last fortnight in helping her godmother prepare  for her tedious journey.    With the knowledge that she would have a fortnight, perhaps more, in  which there would be little else to do than to visit the ruins, she had  rushed through the principal objects of interest in the wake of a  verbose dragoman, and then given every moment of her time to her  beloved godmother, to whom she had said good-bye that very morning.    Restless and irritated by the trivial conversation of girls of her own  age and the amorous tendencies of the stronger sex of the same age and  also a good bit older, she had spent the afternoon in the hotel  grounds, waiting for the evening, when she could slip away by herself;  having realised that the best time of all in Thebes of the Hundred  Gates is at fall of night, when the shadows cast a seemly cloak over  the vulgarity of the modern buildings, and give an air of romance even  to the glittering lights of the appalling esplanade, which flaunts its  tawdry modernity cheek by jowl with the quay, built by one of the  Ptolemies, and in use even to the present day.    When the call of the _Muezzin_ from the Mosque of Abou'l-Haggag came to  her an hour before sunset she went in, bathed and dressed, and dined in  her own room.  Later, she stole out, ordered her car and drove herself  along the broad tree-lined road and up the avenue of ram-headed  Sphinxes to the first pylon of the great Temple.    There she switched off the lights, hid the starting-handle under the  cushions and, tip-toeing, passed through the first pylon and up to the  broken kiosk of the Ethiopian Tahraka.    She walked quietly, though assuredly her footsteps would have been  deadened by Egypt's sands even if she had walked upon her heels, and  stole through the vestibule to the second pylon, occasionally switching  on her electric torch for fear of being tripped by fallen stone.    She had not heard of the great catastrophe which had brought the  columns hurtling to the ground, due perhaps to the merciless greed of  Ptolemy Lathyrus, or earthquake, or the well-known fact that temples,  houses or plans built upon sand are bound to crumble; nor did she wot  of the precariousness of the walls around her or the shifting  propensities of the foundations.    She walked quietly because the spirit of the place was upon her, the  spirit which puts a hand upon your mouth so that words shall not  disturb the ghosts of the past, and which blinds your eyes so that you  look back upon that hour as on a dream.    Yet, as she passed through pylon, vestibule and the Great Court, she  stopped and turned, went on, and stopped again to listen.    There was no sound.    Flashing her light upon part of a fallen column, she sat down upon it,  with the purple sky studded with stars as roof above her head and the  sands of ages as carpet to her feet.    And as she sat, so still, her thoughts turned to the man who had said  he loved her and who yet seemed so content to leave her quite alone.    A woman may refuse a man's honest proposal of marriage and have no  intention whatever of marrying him, even later on, but that does not  mean he need necessarily take her at her word to the extent of retiring  altogether from the horizon of her life.    As for the rest, the flowers upon her breakfast-table, her rides at  dawn--about that she instinctively kept her thoughts in check.  It was  like the cut-glass bottle of perfume which you are not allowed to use,  on account of your youth; the first few lines of the first novel you  filched from your mother's book-stand that afternoon she was out; the  first time you put on a real evening dress and wound a fichu about your  neck before you opened your bedroom door.    And as she sat there fell a little sound.    Bits of masonry as big as a bowl or as small as a marble are quite  likely to fall upon your pate in colossal ruins, but, remembering the  vague uneasiness which had caused her to stop and listen, further back,  she sat forward and switched on her light.    Against the wall opposite her, entirely robed in black, with a  glittering jewel clasping a corner of the great black mantle swinging  from the shoulders, there stood a man.    There was no sign of the paralysing terror which swept the girl; her  face, which had gone dead-white, was in shadow, her hands under control.    For a moment she sat breathless, then flashed the light full into the  face of the man who had stalked her through the temple, then flashed it  back to the jewel, then sighed--an unutterable sigh of relief.    The jewel was in the shape of a hawk, the symbol of Ancient Egypt.    Just for a moment they stayed in utter silence, those two who for all  we know may have met and parted in this very spot in the days of the  XII dynasty, to meet and part and meet again.    Then she tackled the untoward situation in the only possible way.    \"Will you, as you promised, if the hour is come, tell me the tale of  the Hawk of Egypt?\"    She spoke sweetly, softly, switching out the light.    And Hugh Carden Ali crossed the intervening square of sand, which,  however, being one-half his heritage, stretched an impregnable barrier  between them, and sank to the ground beside her.    The perfume of her raiment was about him, the sound of her breathing in  his ears; all the love and worship of his heart was hers."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],[0,"History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#20)"],[1,"ves.\" Two other Polish-Jewish revolutionaries, Lubliner  and Hollaenderski, shared all the miseries of the refugees and, while in  exile, indulged in reflections concerning the destiny of their brethren  at home. [3]    [Footnote 1: Andreas Tovyanski (In Polish _Towianski_, 1799-1878), a  Christian mystic, founded in Paris a separate community which fostered  the belief in the restoration of the Polish and the Jewish people. The  community counted among its members several Jews. The famous Polish poet  Adam Mitzkevich (in Polish _Mickiewicz_, 1798-1855) joined Tovyanski in  his endeavors, and on one occasion even appeared in a Paris synagogue on  the Ninth of Ab to make an appeal to the Jews.]    [Footnote 2: See above, p. 105.]    [Footnote 3: Lubliner published _Des Juifs en Pologne_, Brussels, 1839;  Hollaenderski wrote _Les Israelites en Pologne_, Paris, 1846.]    In pacified Poland, which, deprived of her former autonomous  constitution, was now ruled by the iron hand of the Russian viceroy,  Paskevich, the Jews at first experienced no palpable changes. Their  civil status was regulated, as heretofore, by the former Polish  legislation, not by that of the Empire. It was only in 1843 that the  Polish Jews were in one respect equalized with their Russian brethren.  Instead of the old recruiting tax, they were now forced to discharge  military service in person. However, the imperial ukase extending the  operation of the Conscription Statute of 1827 to the Jews of the Kingdom  contained several alleviations. Above all, its most cruel provision, the  conscription of juveniles or cantonists, was set aside. The age of  conscription was fixed at twenty to twenty-five, while boys between the  age of twelve and eighteen were to be drafted only when the parents  themselves wished to offer them as substitutes for their elder sons who  were of military age. Nevertheless, to the Polish Jews, who had never  known of conscription, military service lasting a quarter of a century,  to be discharged in a strange Russian environment, seemed a terrible  sacrifice. The \"Congregational Board\" of Warsaw, having learned of the  ukase, sent a deputation to St. Petersburg with a petition to grant the  Jews of the Kingdom equal rights with the Christians, referring to the  law of 1817 which distinctly stated that the Jews were to be released  from personal military service so long as they were denied equal civil  rights. The petition of course proved of no avail; the very term \"equal  rights\" was still missing in the Russian vocabulary.    Only in point of disabilities were the Jews of Poland gradually placed  on an equal footing with their Russian brethren. In 1845 the Russian law  imposing a tax on the traditional Jewish attire [1] was extended in its  operation to the Polish Jews, descending with the force of a real  calamity upon the hasidic masses of Poland. Fortunately for the Jews of  Poland, the other experiments, in which St. Petersburg was revelling  during that period, left them unscathed. The crises connected with the  problems of Jewish autonomy and the Jewish school, which threatened to  disrupt Russian Jewry in the forties, had been passed by the Jews of  Poland some twenty years earlier. Moreover, the Polish Jews had the  advantage over their Russian brethren in that the abrogated Kahal had  after all been replaced by another communal organization, however  curtailed it was, and that the secular school was not forced upon them  in the same brutal manner in which the Russian Crown schools had been  imposed upon the Jews of the Empire. Taken as a whole, the lot of the  Polish Jews, sad though it was, might yet be pronounced enviable when  compared with the condition of their brethren in the Pale of Settlement,  where the rightlessness of the Jews during that period bordered  frequently on martyrdom.    [Footnote 1: A law to that effect had been passed on February 1, 1843.  It was preparatory to the entire prohibition of Jewish dress. See below,  p. 143 et seq.]          CHAPTER XVI      THE INNER LIFE OF RUSSIAN JEWRY DURING  THE PERIOD OF MILITARY DESPOTISM    1. THE UNCOMPROMISING ATTITUDE OF RABBINISM    The Russian Government had left nothing undone to shatter the old Jewish  mode of life. Despotic Tzardom, whose ignorance of Jewish life was only  equalled by its hostility to it, lifted its hand to strike not merely at  the obsolete forms but also at the sound historic foundations of  Judaism. The system of conscription which annually wrenched thousands of  youths and lads from the bosom of their families, the barracks which  served as mission houses, the method of stimulating and even forcing the  conversion of recruits, the establishment of Crown schools for the same  covert purpose, the abolition of communal autonomy, civil  disfranchisement, persecution and oppression, all were set in motion  against the citadel of Judaism. And the ancient citadel, which had held  out for thousands of years, stood firm again, while the defenders within  her walls, in their endeavor to ward off the enemies' blows, had not  only succeeded in covering up the breaches, but also in barring the  entrance of fresh air from without. If it be true that, in pursuing its  system of tutelage and oppression, the Russian Government was genuinely  actuated by the desire to graft the modicum of European culture, to  which the Russia of Nicholas I. could lay claim, upon the Jews, it  certainly achieved the reverse of what it aimed at. The hand which dealt  out blows could not disseminate enlightenment; the hammer which was  lifted to shatter Jewish separatism had only the effect of hardening it.  The persecuted Jews clutched eagerly at their old mode of life, the  target of their enemies' attacks; they clung not only to its permanent  foundations but also to its obsolete superstructure. The despotism of  extermination from without was counterbalanced by a despotism of  conservation from within, by that rigid discipline of conduct to which  the masses submitted without a murmur, though its yoke must have weighed  heavily upon the few, the stray harbingers of a new order of things.    The Government had managed to disrupt the Jewish communal organization  and rob the Kahal of all its authority by degrading it to a kind of  posse for the capture of recruits and extortion of taxes. But while the  Jewish masses hated the Kahal elders, they retained their faith in their  spiritual leaders, the rabbis and Tzaddiks. [1] Heeding the command of  these leaders, they closed their ranks, and offered stubborn resistance  to the dangerous cultural influences threatening them from without. Life  was dominated by rigidly conservative principles. The old scheme of  family life, with all its patriarchal survivals, remained in force. In  spite of the law, embodied in the Statute of 1835, which fixed the  minimum age of the bridegroom at eighteen (and that of the bride at  sixteen), the practice of early marriages continued as theretofore.  Parents arranged marriages between children of thirteen and fifteen.  Boys of school age often became husbands and fathers, and continued to  attend heder or yeshibah after their marriage, weighed down by the  triple tutelage of father, father-in-law, and teacher. The growing  generation knew not the sweetness of being young. Their youth withered  under the weight of family chains, the pressure of want or material  dependence. The spirit of protest, the striving for rejuvenation, which  asserted itself in some youthful souls, was crushed in the vise of a  time-honored discipline, the product of long ages. The slightest  deviation from a custom, a rite, or old habits of thought met with  severe punishment. A short jacket or a trimmed beard was looked upon as  a token of dangerous free-thinking. The reading of books written in  foreign languages, or even written in Hebrew, when treating of secular  subjects, brought upon the culprit untold hardships. The scholastic  education resulted in producing men entirely unfit for the battle of  life, so that in many families energetic women took charge of the  business and became the wage earners, [2] while their husbands were  losing themselves in the mazes of speculation, somewhere in the recesses  of the rabbinic _Betha-Midrash_ or the hasidic _Klaus_.    [Footnote 1: See on the latter term, Vol. I, p. 227.]    [Footnote 2: This type of Jewish woman, current in Russia until recent  times, was called _Eshet Hayil_, \"a woman of valour,\" with allusion to  Prov. 31.10.]    In Lithuania the whole mental energy of the Jewish youth was absorbed by  Talmudism. The synagogue served as a \"house of study\" outside the hours  fixed for prayers. There the local rabbi or a private scholar gave  lectures on the Talmud which were listened to by hosts of _yeshibah  bahurs_. [1] The great yeshibahs of Volozhin, Mir, [2] and other towns  sent forth thousands of rabbis and Talmudists. Mentality, erudition,  dialectic subtlety were valued here above all else. Yet, as soon as the  mind, whetted by talmudic dialectics, would point its edge against the  existing order of things, or turn in the direction of living knowledge,  of \"extraneous sciences,\" [3] it was checked by threats of  excommunication and persecution. Many were the victims of this petrified  milieu, whose protests against the old order of things and whose  strivings for a newer life were nipped in the bud.    [Footnote 1: On the _bahur_ or Talmud student see Vol. I, p. 116 et  seq.]    [Footnote 2: On the yeshibah in Volozhin, in the government of Vilna,  see Vol. I, p. 380 et seq. Mir is a townlet in the government of Minsk.]    [Footnote 3: An old Hebrew expression for secular learning.]    Instructive in this respect is the fate of one of the most remarkable  Talmudists of his time, Rabbi Menashe Ilyer. Ilyer spent most of his  life in the townlets of Smorgoni and Ilya (whence his surname), in the  government of Vilna, and died of"]]]
