Part. is either translated by a  preposition followed by the Infinitive Mood or by the Pres. Part.  without a Preposition, as--    Al ir _(or _yendo) a la Bolsa; On going to the Exchange.    EXCEPTION--    After _en_ we find the Pres. Part. used with the following meaning--e.g.    En acabando saldre: As soon as I have finished, I shall go out.    \"I, acting as trustee,\" is translated \"Yo, procediendo como sindico\";  but \"I wrote to the party acting as umpire\" would be \"Escribi a la  persona que funcionaba (_not_ funcionando) de arbitro.\"    After \"Intentar,\"[139] \"Ver,\" \"Oir,\" \"Sentir,\" and \"Simular\" the  Infinitive only can be used in Spanish, as--    [Footnote 139: Or verbs of similar meaning.

Le veo pasar: I see him passing.       \"My coming,\" \"my going,\" etc., are translated: \"El venir _or_ el       haber venido yo,\" etc.]    The Past Part. may be used in an absolute manner, as--    Entregada la carta se fue: The letter (being) delivered, he went.

LESSON XXIII.                       (Leccion vigesima tercera.)                            THE MOODS (_contd._).      The =Indicative Mood= (Modo Indicativo) is that form of the verb that  expresses the action in a =positive manner=, as a =fact=.    The =Conditional Mood= (Modo Condicional)[140] affirms like the  Indicative Mood in a positive manner, =but subject to a condition=.    The =Imperative Mood= is used to command or to beg. This mood has only  one tense and one distinct form of person: the second, as--    Habla tu: Speak thou.  Hablad vosotros:  Speak ye _or_ you.    The 1st pers. sing, does not occur and the other persons are taken from  the Present Subjunctive.[141]    In the 3rd person (and sometimes even the 1st plural) the pres. subj.  may take the place of the Imperative used affirmatively. This becomes  apparent by the use of _Que_, which precedes the Subjunctive and when an  object pronoun occurs in the sentence, as--    Escribalo el _or_ Que lo escriba el: Let him write it.    There is no Imperative Mood negative in Spanish.[142]    [Footnote 140: English form: (auxiliary) should + verb for 1st persons;  (auxiliary) would + verb for 2nd and 3rd persons.]    [Footnote 141: With only one exception--       =Ir= (to go). 1st pers. pl., Pres. Subj.--Vayamos. 1st pers. pl.,       Imperative--Vayamos _or_ vamos (more used).]    [Footnote 142: It is borrowed entirely from the Pres. Subjunctive, as:  No hables, no hable, no hablemos, no hableis, no hablen. The difference  is of course, only apparent in the 2nd person.]      =The Subjunctive Mood=.    This mood offers some difficulty to English students; this arises from  the fact that in English this mode of viewing the action of the verb is  often rendered by the indicative mood or by the semi-auxiliary verbs  \"may,\" \"might,\" \"should,\" \"would.\"    =Note=.--The Spanish rule on the Subjunctive mood must be therefore  applied irrespective of the English construction.    GENERAL RULE.    The Subjunctive Mood can only be used in dependent clauses, as--    Yo quiero que el venga: I wish him to come.  Yo quiero que el vaya: I wish him to go.    And then, only when, by reason of what precedes in the Principal Clause,  the action of the Subordinate verb is not expressed in a positive manner  (i.e., as a fact) but as merely contingent (i.e., only conceived in the  mind), as--    Yo declare que el vino (_or_ vendria): I say that he came    _or_ that he would come.  Yo espero que el venga: I hope that he may come.  Yo esperaba que el viniese: I hoped that he might, _or_    would come.    SPECIAL RULES.    I. A verb in a dependent clause is placed (generally) in the Subjunctive  Mood after verbs expressing an action, or emotion of the mind, when the  subjects of the principal and of the subordinate verbs are different.    EXAMPLES of principal verbs which govern the following verb in the  Subjunctive Mood--    aconsejar (to advise)  alegrarse de que (to be glad that)  avergonzarse de que (to be ashamed that)  conceder (to grant)  conseguir (to obtain)  desear (to desire)  esperar (to hope)  evitar (to avoid)  impedir (to hinder)  mandar (to order)  querer (to wish)  rogar (to ask, to beg)  sentir (to regret)  temer (to fear)  confiar en que (to trust)    N.B.--(_a_) If the 2nd verb should have the same subject, use the  Infinitive Mood, as--    Deseo que venga:  I wish him to come.  Deseo venir: I wish to come.    (_b_) After verbs expressing joy, shame, sorrow, or fear, the Indicative  may be used instead of the Subjunctive.    (_c_) After \"mandar\" (to order) the subordinate verb is often in the  Infinitive instead of the Subjunctive, as--    Mandele V. que lo haga: Order him to do it.  Mandeselo V. hacer: Order him to do it.           VOCABULARY.    =agradar, favorecer=, to oblige  =almacenero, dependiente de almacen=, warehouseman  =celebrar=, to be glad of  =colorido=, colouring  =*complacer=, to oblige  =complazco, etc=., I oblige, etc.  =(el) cortapluma=, penknife  =cortesmente=, politely  =coste flete y seguro=, cost, freight and insurance  =*dar las gracias=, to hank  =demora=, delay  =*demostrar confianza=, to show confidence  =deplorar=, to deplore  =dictados=, dictates  =en seguida=, at once  =franco de averia particular=, free of particular average  =*hacer una remesa=, to send a remittance "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"will  hold its own as long as dreams are dreamed, is here presented in a  worthy setting, and one which will meet with universal approbation.
