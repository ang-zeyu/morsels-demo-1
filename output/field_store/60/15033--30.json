The construction of the thing fascinated her, and she opened the door in  the skirt to satisfy her curiosity about the inner workings of the  miraculous halo. She saw how the thing was done and then became  interested in the inside of the statue itself. There was plenty of room  in it to conceal a person. Just for the fun of the thing Sahwah got  inside and drew the door shut after her, trying to imagine herself a  fugitive hiding in there. There were no openings in the skirt part, but  up above the waist line there were various holes to admit air. \"It's no  fun hiding in a statue if you can't see what's going on outside,\"  thought Sahwah, and so she stood up straight, as in this position her  eyes would come on a level with one of the holes. She could see out  without being seen herself, just as if she were looking through the face  piece of a suit of armor. The fun she got out of this sport, however,  soon changed to dismay when she tried to get down again. It had taken  some squeezing to get her head into the upper space, and now she found  that she was wedged securely in. She could not move her head one  particle. What was worse, a quantity of cotton wool, which had been put  inside the upper part of the body for some reason or other, was  dislodged by her squeezing in and pressed against her mouth, forming an  effective silencer. Thus, while she could see out over the stage, she  could not call out for help. Her hands were pinioned down at her sides,  and by standing up she had brought her knees into a narrow place so that  they were wedged together and she could not attract attention by  kicking. Here was a pretty state of affairs. The benign Maid of Orleans  had Sahwah in as merciless a grip as that with which the famous Iron  Maiden of medieval times crushed out the lives of its victims.    Sahwah knew that her failure to come from school would call out a  search, but who would ever look for her in the statue on the stage? Her  only hope was to wait until the play was in progress and the door was  opened to conceal the child. Then another thought startled her into a  perspiration. She was in the opening scene of the play. If she was not  there, the play could not commence. They would spend the evening  searching for her and the statue would not be opened. What would they do  about the play? The house was sold out and the people would come to see  the performance and there would be none. All on account of her stupidity  in wedging herself inside of the statue. Sahwah called herself severe  names as she languished in her prison. Fortunately there were enough  holes in the thing to supply plenty of ventilation, otherwise it might  have gone hard with her. The cramped position became exceedingly  tiresome. She tried, by forcing her weight against the one side or the  other, to throw the statue over, thinking that it would attract  attention in this way and some one would be likely to open it, but the  heavy wooden base to which it was fastened held it secure. Sahwah was  caught like a rat in a trap. The minutes passed like hours. Sounds died  away in the building, as the last of the lingerers on the downstairs  floor took themselves off through the front entrance. She could hear the  slam of the heavy door and then a shout as one boy hailed another in  greeting. Then silence over everything.    A quarter, or maybe a half, hour dragged by on leaden feet. Suddenly,  without noise or warning, two figures appeared on the stage, coming on  through the back entrance. Sahwah's heart beat joyfully. Here was some  one to look over the scenery again and if she could only attract their  attention they would liberate her. She made a desperate effort and  wrenched her mouth open to call, only to get it full of fuzzy cotton  wool that nearly choked her. There was no hope then, but that they would  open the door of the statue and find her accidentally. She could hear  the sound of talking in low voices. The boys were on the other side of  the statue, where she could not see them.    \"Let it down easy,\" she heard one of them say.    \"Better get around on the other side,\" said a second voice.    The boy thus spoken to moved around until he was directly before the  opening in front of Sahwah's eyes. With a start she recognized Joe  Lanning. What business had Joe Lanning on the stage at this time? He was  not in the play and he did not belong to the Thessalonian Society. There  was only one explanation--Joe was up to some mischief again. She had not  the slightest doubt that the other voice belonged to Abraham Goldstein,  and thus indeed it proved, for a moment later he moved around so as to  come into range of her vision. The two withdrew a few paces and looked  at the statue, holding a hasty colloquy in inaudible tones, and then  Joe, mounting a chair, laid hold of the Maid just above the waist line,  while Abraham seized the wooden base. Sahwah felt her head going down  and her feet going up. The boys were carrying the statue off the stage  and out through the back entrance, over the little bridge at the back of  the stage and into the hall. It was the queerest ride Sahwah had ever  taken.    The boys paused before the elevator, which seemed to be standing ready  with the door open. \"Will she go in?\" asked Abraham.    \"I'm afraid not,\" answered Joe. \"Well have to carry her downstairs.\"  Sahwah shuddered. Would she go down head first or feet first? They  carried her head first and she was dizzy with the rush of blood to her  head before the two long flights were accomplished. At the foot of the  last flight they laid the statue down. The hall was in total darkness.    \"What are you doing?\" asked the voice of Joe. Abraham was apparently  producing something from somewhere. In a minute Joe was laughing. \"Good  stunt,\" he said approvingly. \"Where did you get them?\"    \"Swiped them out of Room 22, where all the stuff for the play is.\" Joe  flashed a small pocket electric light and by its glimmer Sahwah could  see him adjusting a false beard--the one that was to be worn by the  villain in the play. Abraham was apparently disguising himself in a  similar fashion. This accomplished they picked up the statue again and  carried it down the half flight of stairs to the back entrance of the  school. For some mysterious reason this door was open. Just outside  stood an automobile truck. At the back of the school lay the wide  athletic field, extending for several acres. The nearest street was all  of four blocks away. In the darkness it was impossible to see across  this stretch of space and distinguish the actions of the two  conspirators in the event people should be passing along this street.  Even if the truck itself were seen that would cause no comment, for  deliveries were constantly being made at the rear entrance of the  school.    The statue was lifted into the truck, covered with a piece of canvas,  and Joe and Abraham sprang to the driver's seat and started the machine.  Sahwah very nearly suffocated under that canvas. Fortunately the ride  was a short one. In about seven or eight minutes she felt the bump as  they turned into a driveway, and then the truck came to a stop. The boys  jumped down from the seat, opened a door which slid back with a scraping  noise like a barn door and then lifted the statue from the truck and  carried it into a building. From the light of their pocket flashes  Sahwah could make out that she was in a barn, which was evidently  unused. It was entirely empty. Setting the statue in a corner, the boys  went out, closing the door after them. Sahwah was left in total  darkness, and in a ten times worse position than she had been in before.  On the stage at school there was some hope of the statue's being opened  eventually, but here she could remain for weeks before being discovered.  Sahwah began to wonder just how long she could hold out before she  starved. She was hungry already.    She closed her eyes with weariness from her strained position, and it is  possible that she dozed off for a few moments. In fact, that was what  she did do. She dreamed that she was at the circus and all the wild  animals had broken loose and were running about the audience. She could  hear the roar of the lions and the screeching of the tigers. She woke up  with a start and thought for a moment that her dream was true. The barn  was full of wild animals which were roaring and chasing each other  around. Then her senses cleared and she recognized the heavy bark of a  large dog and the startled mi-ou of a cat. The dog was chasing the cat  around the barn. She felt the slight thud as the cat leaped up and found  refuge on top of the statue. She could hear it spitting at the dog and  knew that its back was arched in an attitude of defiance. The dog barked  furiously down below. Then, overcome by rage, he made a wild jump for  the cat and lunged his heavy body against the side of the statue. It  toppled over against the corner. For an instant Sahwah thought she was  going to be killed. But the corner of the barn saved the statue from  falling over altogether. It simply leaned back at a slight angle. But  there was something different in her position now. At first she did not  know what it was. Before this her feet were standing squarely on the  wooden base of the statue, but now they were slipping around and seemed  to be dangling. Then she realized what had happened. The shock of the  dog's onslaught had knocked the statue clear off the base, and had also  contrived to loosen her knees a little. To her joy she found that she  could move her feet--could walk. For all the statue was immense, it was  light, and wedged into it as she was she balanced the upper part of it  perfectly. She moved out from the corner.    The dog was still barking furiously and circling around the barn after  the cat. Then the cat found a paneless window by which she had entered  and disappeared into the night. The dog,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#20)"],[1,"imal, and we had him safely stranded at night.    With much care were inspected the mouth, the nostrils, the ears, and all  the body, but no parasite was found. The eyes were taken out and prepared  for histological study. The set of teeth was all covered by a membrane that  surrounded internally the lips; the teeth are very little, and almost in a  rudimental state. The mouth, instead of opening in the inferior part of the  head, as in common sharks, was at the extremity of the head; the jaws  having the same bend.    Cutting the animal on one side of the backbone we met (1) a compact layer  of white fat 20 centimeters deep; (2) the cartilaginous ribs covered with  blood vessels; (3) a stratum of flabby, stringy, white muscle, 60  centimeters high, apparently in adipose degeneracy; (4) the stomach.    By each side of the backbone he had three chamferings, or flutings, that  were distinguished by inflected interstices. The color of the back was  brown with yellow spots that became close and small toward the head, so as  to be like marble spots. The length of the shark was 8.90 m. from the mouth  to the _pinna caudalis_ extremity, the greatest circumference 6.50 m., and  2.50 m. the main diameter (the outline of the two projections is made for  giving other dimensions).    The natives call the species _Tintoreva_, and the most aged of the village  had only once before fished such an animal, but smaller. While the animal  was on board we saw several _Remora_ about a foot long drop from his mouth;  it was proved that these fish lived fixed to the palate, and one of them  was pulled off and kept in the zoological collection of the ship.    The Vettor Pisani has up the present visited Gibraltar, Cape Verde Islands,  Pernambuco, Rio Janeiro, Monte Video, Valparaiso, many ports of Peru,  Guayaquil, Panama, Galapagos Islands, and all the collections were up to  this sent to the Zoological Station at Naples to be studied by the  naturalists. By this time the ship left Callao for Honolulu, Manila, Hong  Kong, and, as the Challenger had not crossed the Pacific Ocean in these  directions, we made several soundings and deep-sea thermometrical  measurements from Callao to Honolulu. Soundings are made with a steel wire  (Thompson system) and a sounding-rod invented by J. Palumbo, captain of the  ship. The thermometer employed is a Negretti and Zambra deep-sea  thermometer, improved by Captain Maguaghi (director of the Italian R.N.  Hydrographic Office).    With the thermometer wire has always been sent down a tow-net which opens  and closes automatically, also invented by Captain Palumbo. This tow-net  has brought up some little animals that I think are unknown.    G. CHIERCHIA.      Honolulu July 1.    The shark captured by the Vettor Pisani in the Gulf of Panama is _Rhinodon  typicus_, probably the most gigantic fish in existence. Mr. Swinburne Ward,  formerly commissioner of the Seychelles, has informed me that it attains to  a length of 50 feet or more, which statement was afterward confirmed by  Prof. E.P. Wright. Originally described by Sir A. Smith from a single  specimen which was killed in the neighborhood of Cape Town, this species  proved to be of not uncommon occurrence in the Seychelles Archipelago,  where it is known by the name of \"Chagrin.\" Quite recently Mr. Haly  reported the capture of a specimen on the coast of Ceylon. Like other large  sharks (_Carcharodon rondeletii, Selache maxima_, etc.), Rhinodon has a  wide geographical range, and the fact of its occurrence on the Pacific  coast of America, previously indicated by two sources, appears now to be  fully established. T. Gill in 1865 described a large shark known in the  Gulf of California by the name of \"Tiburon ballenas\" or whale-shark, as a  distinct genus--_Micristodus punctatus_--which, in my opinion, is the same  fish. And finally, Prof. W. Nation examined in 1878 a specimen captured at  Callao. Of this specimen we possess in the British Museum a portion of the  dental plate. The teeth differ in no respect from those of a Seychelles  Chagrin; they are conical, sharply pointed, recurved, with the base of  attachment swollen. Making no more than due allowance for such variations  in the descriptions by different observers as are unavoidable in accounts  of huge creatures examined by some in a fresh, by others in a preserved,  state, we find the principal characteristics identical in all these  accounts, viz.: the form of the body, head, and snout, relative  measurements, position of mouth, nostrils, and eyes, dentition, peculiar  ridges on the side of the trunk and tail, coloration, etc. I have only to  add that this shark is stated to be of mild disposition and quite harmless.  Indeed, the minute size of its teeth has led to the belief in the  Seychelles that it is a herbivorous fish, which, however, is not probable.    ALBERT GUNTHER.    Natural History Museum, _July 30_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.      [Illustration: THE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.--THE FARTHEST POINT NORTH.]    Some account has been given of the American Meteorological Expedition,  commanded by Lieutenant, now Major, Greely, of the United States Army, in  the farthest north channels, beyond Smith Sound, that part of the Arctic  regions where the British Polar expedition, in May, 1876, penetrated to  within four hundred geographical miles of the North Pole. The American  expedition, in 1883, succeeded in getting four miles beyond, this being  effected by a sledge party traveling over the snow from Fort Conger, the  name they had given to their huts erected on the western shore near  Discovery Cove, in Lady Franklin Sound. The farthest point reached, on May  18, was in latitude 83 deg. 24 min. N.; longitude 40 deg. 46 min. W., on  the Greenland coast. The sledge party was commanded by Lieutenant Lockwood,  and the following particulars are supplied by Sergeant Brainerd, who  accompanied Lieutenant Lockwood on the expedition. During their sojourn in  the Arctic regions the men were allowed to grow the full beard, except  under the mouth, where it was clipped short. They wore knitted mittens, and  over these heavy seal-skin mittens were drawn, connected by a tanned  seal-skin string that passed over the neck, to hold them when the hands  were slipped out. Large tanned leather pockets were fastened outside the  jackets, and in very severe weather jerseys were sometimes worn over the  jackets for greater protection against the intense cold. On the sledge  journeys the dogs were harnessed in a fan-shaped group to the traces, and  were never run tandem. In traveling, the men were accustomed to hold on to  the back of the sledge, never going in front of the team, and often took  off their heavy overcoats and threw them on the load. When taking  observations with the sextant, Lieutenant Lockwood generally reclined on  the snow, while Sergeant Brainerd called time and made notes, as shown in  our illustration. When further progress northward was barred by open water,  and the party almost miraculously escaped drifting into the Polar sea,  Lieutenant Lockwood erected, at the highest point of latitude reached by  civilized man, a pyramidal-shaped cache of stones, six feet square at the  base, and eight or nine feet high. In a little chamber about a foot square  half-way to the apex, and extending to the center of the pile, he placed a  self-recording spirit thermometer, a small tin cylinder containing records  of the expedition, and then sealed up the aperture with a closely fitting  stone. The cache was surmounted with a small American flag made by Mrs.  Greely, but there were only thirteen stars, the number of the old  revolutionary flag. From the summit of Lockwood Island, the scene presented  in our illustration, 2,000 feet above the sea, Lieutenant Lockwood was  unable to make out any land to the north or the northwest. \"The awful  panorama of the Arctic which their elevation spread out before them made a  profound impression upon the explorers. The exultation which was natural to  the achievement which they found they had accomplished was tempered by the  reflections inspired by the sublime desolation of that stern and silent  coast and the menace of its unbroken solitude. Beyond to the eastward was  the interminable defiance of the unexplored coast--black, cold, and  repellent. Below them lay the Arctic Ocean, buried beneath frozen chaos. No  words can describe the confusion of this sea of ice--the hopeless asperity  of it, the weariness of its torn and tortured surface. Only at the remote  horizon did distance and the fallen snow mitigate its roughness and soften  its outlines; and beyond it, in the yet unattainable recesses of the great  circle, they looked toward the Pole itself. It was a wonderful sight, never  to be forgotten, and in some degree a realization of the picture that  astronomers conjure to themselves when the moon is nearly full, and they  look down into the great plain which is called the Ocean of Storms, and  watch the shadows of sterile and airless peaks follow a slow procession  across its silver surface.\"--_Illustrated London News_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NILE EXPEDITION.      [Illustration: WHALER GIG FOR THE NILE.]    As soon as the authorities had finally made up their minds to send a  flotilla of boats to Cairo for the relief of Khartoum, not a moment was  lost in issuing orders to the different shipbuilding contractors for the  completion, with the utmost dispatch, of the 400 \"whaler-gigs\" for service  on the Nile. They are light-looking boats, built of white pine, and weigh  each about 920 lb., that is without the gear, and are supposed to carry  four tons of provisions, ammunition, and camp appliances, the food being  sufficient for 100 days. The crew will number twelve men, soldiers and  sailors, the former rowing, while the latter (two) will attend the helm."]]]
