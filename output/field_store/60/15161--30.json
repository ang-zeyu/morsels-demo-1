And upon  them Philo appears to be pouring his wrath when he exclaims: \"How have  you the effrontery to go on making and listening to fine professions  about piety and the honor of God, when you have within you, forsooth,  the mind equal to God that comprehends all human things, and can  combine good and evil portions, giving to some a mixed, to others an  unmixed lot? And when anybody accuses you of impiety, you brazenly  declare that you belong to the school of that noble guide and teacher  Cain (_i.e._ insolent reason), who bade you pay honor to the secondary  rather than the primary cause.\"    Philo has often been reproached with intellectualism, and excessive  regard to acquired wisdom, and it may be urged that by his allegorical  method he tried to find in the Bible the sanction of two degrees of  religious faith, the higher for the philosopher and the lower for the  ordinary man. At the same time, however, before his God he retains the  childlike simplicity of the most un-Hellenic rabbi, and the perfect  humility of the Hasid. His conviction of the dependence of all upon  God's grace is the perfect corrective of his intellectual  exclusiveness. The idea of God as the unity which comprehends  everything and causes everything is the great Jewish contribution to  thought, and binds our literature together in all its manifestations.  It characterizes and unites the poetical utterance of the Bible  prophets, the pious wisdom of the rabbis, the philosophical systems of  Philo and Maimonides.    The more sublime and exalted the conception of God, the more  imperative became the need for the thinking Jew to explain how the  perfect infinite Being came into relation with the imperfect finite  world of man and matter. How can the incorporeal God be the founder of  the material universe? How can the infinite mind be present in the  finite thought of man? How can the all-good Power be the creator of  the evil which we see in the material world and of the wickedness that  flourisheth among men? These questions presented themselves to the  Israelite after he had consummated his marvellous religious intuition,  and became the starting-point of a theology which is nascent in the  Wisdom literature of the Bible. Theology is the reasoning about God  which follows always in the footsteps of religious certitude. First,  man by his intuitive reason rises to some idea of the Godhead  satisfying to his emotion; next, by his discursive reason, he  endeavors to justify that idea to his experience in analyzing God's  operations. Renan, disposing sweepingly of a great question, declares  that the Jewish monotheism excluded any true theology. But, in fact,  in Palestine, and still more in Alexandria from the third century  B.C.E., Jewish thought had as one of its constant aims to develop a  theory of the operations of the one God in the world of material  plurality. When the Jews came in contact with the cosmological  mythology of Babylon, their God seemed to soar beyond the reach of  men, and they looked to powers nearer them to bridge the widening  gulf. To some extent this aim engendered a modification in the  religious monotheism, and led to the interposition of intermediate  conceptions between the Inconceivable and man. \"The whole angelology,\"  says Deutsch,[194] \"so strikingly simple before the Captivity and so  wonderfully complex after it, owes its quick development in Babylonian  soil to some awe-stricken desire which grows with growing culture,  removing the inconceivable Being further and further from human touch  or knowledge.\" Speaking generally, it may be said that reflection  about God's relations produced in Palestine the doctrine of angels, in  Alexandria the doctrine of Wisdom and the Logos. At the same time the  Wisdom and the Word were not unknown to the Palestinian Midrash, and  the hierarchies of angels to the Alexandrian, for the suggestion of  the different subordinate powers had been evolved before the two  traditions had become independent. The doctrine of angels never indeed  won recognition from the rabbis, but it was for centuries an element  of popular belief.    More philosophical than the doctrine of angels was the conception of  different attributes of God [Hebrew: mdot], which were different  manifestations of His activity, to the human mind separable and  distinguishable from each other, though absolutely they were  inseparable aspects of the Godhead. Chief among these were the  attribute of mercy and the attribute of justice, [Hebrew: mdt hrhmim]  and [Hebrew: mdt hdin],[195] by which, according to a Midrash, Adam  was driven from Eden. And these conceptions, though distrusted by the  Synagogue, entered into later parts of the Prayer Book. \"Attribute of  Mercy, reveal thyself for us; make our supplication to fall at the feet of  Thy Creator; and on behalf of Thy people beseech for mercy\"; thus runs  a fine prayer in the Ne'ilah service of the Day of Atonement, and many  of the other Selihot prove the persistence of this development of  Jewish belief. The theory of Divine attributes was common to Palestine  and Alexandria, and plays, as we shall see, an important part in  Philo's[196] thought; but the distinctive Hellenistic theology is the  hypostasis of the Wisdom and the Word of God. In the Bible itself, and  notably in Proverbs, we find Wisdom personified--the first vague,  poetical suggestion of a Jewish theology. As the Jews came into  contact with Hellenic influence, the tendency to develop the  personification into a power increased, and may be traced through the  first flower of Graeco-Jewish culture, the Wisdom literature. The Greek  philosophers had conceived the First Cause as a ruling Mind, or  universal Reason, and influenced by this conception, yet loyal to  their monotheistic faith, the Jewish writers of the Hellenistic age  spoke of the Wisdom as the minister of God, the power by which He  ruled creation. The apocryphal books of Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom  of Solomon exhibit Wisdom passing from the poetical personification of  the Bible to the separate hypostasis of theology. In the verse of the  Bible sage, \"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her  seven pillars\" (Prov. ix. 1), she is the creation of the purely  poetical fancy, but in the Wisdom of Solomon she has become a link  between Heaven and earth, the creation of the theologian's reflection.  \"She reacheth from one end of the world to the other with strength,  and ordereth all things graciously. She is settled by God on His  throne, and by her He made the world, by her the righteous were saved.  She watched over the father of the human race, and she delivered  Israel from Egypt.\" In Ecclesiasticus it is written, \"All Wisdom is  from the Lord and is with Him forever. She cometh forth from the mouth  of the Most High, and was created before all things. God having  fashioned her from the beginning placed her over all His works. Then  she covered the earth as a mist, she pitched her tent in high places  and her palace was in a pillar of cloud. She ministered in the  tabernacle, and was established in Zion, in Jerusalem, the beloved  city.\" In similar strain, in the apocalyptic book of Enoch (xxx), God  says, \"On the sixth day I ordered My Wisdom to make man\"; and in the  Sibylline Oracles and Aristobulus she appears as the assessor of God  who ruleth over men.    Parallel with Wisdom, the Word of God was developed into something  between a poetical image and a separate power. Again the development  starts from a Biblical metaphor. \"By the word of the Lord were the  heavens created, and all their host by the breath of His mouth\" (Ps.  xxxiii). \"God of our Fathers and Lord of Mercy, who didst make all  things by Thy word,\" says the writer of the Wisdom of Solomon.  Inspired again by the phrase of the Psalmist, \"He sent His word, and  healed them\" (Ps. cvi. 20), he hymns the Divine Logos as the  all-powerful emissary doing God's bidding among men. \"It was neither  herb nor emollient that cured Israel in the wilderness (when bitten by  the fiery scorpions), but Thy Logos, O Lord, which heals all things.\"  Later, when he describes the destruction of the first-born in Egypt,  he rises in a paean to a finer poetical flight: \"When tranquil silence  folded all things, and night in her own swiftness was in the midst of  her course, Thy all-powerful Logos leaped from heaven, from his royal  throne, a stern warrior into the midst of the doomed land, bearing as  a sharp sword Thy Divine commandment, and having taken his stand  filled all things with death: and he touched heaven and walked upon  earth.\" The Jewish poet, rejecting the idea that the perfect God could  descend to earth and slay men, brushes away the anthropomorphism of  the Bible, and summons from his mind this creation mixed of Hebrew  imagination and Greek reason. So, too, Onkelos, wherever activity upon  earth was ascribed to God, wrote, in his translation (Targum) of  Scripture, \"the word of the Lord,\" and for the material hand he  substituted the more abstract might. The same development,[197] under  the names of Memra and (less frequently) of [Hebrew: dbor], shows that  the word-agent of God appealed to certain of the rabbis in their  desire to explain away, on the one hand, expressions in the Bible  which seemed to invest the Deity with corporeal qualities, and, on the  other, so to divide His infinite perfection as to make His presence  immanent upon earth.    The teachers at Alexandria were above all others induced to develop  the Word into the active power, since they seemed thereby to find in  the Bible a remarkable anticipation of Greek philosophy. The Greek  Logos, by which \"the Word\" was translated in the Septuagint, meant  also thought and reason, and during the Hellenistic age was the  regular term by which the philosophical schools expressed the  impersonal world-force which governed all things."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14672"],[0,"The Religion of the Ancient Celts (#20)"],[1,"p. 223, _infra_.

In a MS. edited by  Dr. Stirn, Oengus was Dagda's son by Elemar's wife, the amour taking  place in her husband's absence. This incident is a parallel to the  birth-stories of Mongan and Arthur, and has also the Fatherless Child  theme, since Oengus goes in tears to Mider because he has been taunted  with having no father or mother.

[276] The former is Rh[^y]s's interpretation (_HL_ 201) connecting  _Cruaich_ with _cruach_, \"a heap\"; the latter is that of D'Arbois (ii.  106), deriving _Cruaich_ from _cru_, \"blood.\" The idea of the image  being bent or crooked may have been due to the fact that it long stood  ready to topple over, as a result of S.

But he is worshipped by Gaels. _Crin_, \"withered,\"  probably refers to the idol's position after S. Patrick's miracle, no  longer upright but bent like an old man. Dr. Hyde, _Lit.

In a fragmentary version of the story Oengus is  Etain's wooer, but Mider is preferred by her father, and marries her. In  the latter half of the story, Oengus does not appear (see p. 363,  _infra_). Mr. Nutt (_RC_ xxvii. 339) suggests that Oengus, not Mider,  was the real hero of the story, but that its Christian redactors gave  Mider his place in the second part. The fragments are edited by Stirn  (_ZCP_ vol. v.).    [288] _HL_ 146.    [289] See my _Childhood of Fiction_, 114, 153. The tale has some unique  features, as it alone among Western _Maerchen_ and saga variants of the  \"True Bride\" describes the malicious woman as the wife of Mider.

Scuithne maintains he is walking on a  field, and plucks a flower to prove it, while Barri confutes him by  pulling a salmon out of the sea. This resembles an episode in the  meeting of Bran and Manannan (Stokes, _Felire_, xxxix.; Nutt-Meyer, i.  39). Saints are often said to assist men just as the gods did.

Professor Rh[^y]s admits that the theory  of borrowing \"cannot easily be proved.\"          CHAPTER VI.    THE GODS OF THE BRYTHONS      Our knowledge of the gods of the Brythons, i.e. as far as Wales is  concerned, is derived, apart from inscriptions, from the _Mabinogion_,  which, though found in a fourteenth century MS., was composed much  earlier, and contains elements from a remote past. Besides this, the  _Triads_, probably of twelfth-century origin, the _Taliesin_, and other  poems, though obscure and artificial, the work of many a \"confused bard  drivelling\" (to cite the words of one of them), preserve echoes of the  old mythology.[328] Some of the gods may lurk behind the personages of  Geoffrey of Monmouth's _Historia Britonum_ and of the Arthurian cycle,  though here great caution is required. The divinities have become heroes  and heroines, kings and princesses, and if some of the episodes are  based on ancient myths, they are treated in a romantic spirit. Other  episodes are mere _Maerchen_ formulae. Like the wreckage of some rich  galleon, the _debris_ of the old mythology has been used to construct a  new fabric, and the old divinities have even less of the god-like traits  of the personages of the Irish texts.    Some of the personages bear similar names to the Irish divinities, and  in some cases there is a certain similarity of incidents to those of the  Irish tales.[329] Are, then, the gods dimly revealed in Welsh literature  as much Goidelic as Brythonic? Analysing the incidents of the  _Mabinogion_, Professor Anwyl has shown that they have an entirely local  character, and are mainly associated with the districts of Dyfed and  Gwent, of Anglesey, and of Gwynedd, of which Pryderi, Branwen, and  Gwydion are respectively the heroic characters.[330] These are the  districts where a strong Goidelic element prevailed, whether these  Goidels were the original inhabitants of Britain, driven there by  Brythons,[331] or tribes who had settled there from Ireland,[332] or  perhaps a mixture of both. In any case they had been conquered by  Brythons and had become Brythonic in speech from the fifth century  onwards. On account of this Goidelic element, it has been claimed that  the personages of the _Mabinogion_ are purely Goidelic. But examination  proves that only a few are directly parallel in name with Irish  divinities, and while here there are fundamental likenesses, the  _incidents_ with Irish parallels may be due to mere superficial  borrowings, to that interchange of _Maerchen_ and mythical _donnees_  which has everywhere occurred. Many incidents have no Irish parallels,  and most of the characters are entirely different in name from Irish  divinities. Hence any theory which would account for the likenesses,  must also account for the differences, and must explain why, if the  _Mabinogion_ is due to Irish Goidels, there should have been few or no  borrowings in Welsh literature from the popular Cuchulainn and Ossianic  sagas,[333] and why, at a time when Brythonic elements were uppermost,  such care should have been taken to preserve Goidelic myths. If the  tales emanated from native Welsh Goidels, the explanation might be that  they, the kindred of the Irish Goidels, must have had a certain  community with them in divine names and myths, while others of their  gods, more local in character, would differ in name. Or if they are  Brythonic, the likenesses might be accounted for by an early community  in myth "]]]
