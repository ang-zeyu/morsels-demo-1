But it is the intention of  nature, that human education should assist to form the man, and she  has fitted us for it, by the natural principles of imitation and  belief, which discover themselves almost in infancy, as well as by  others which are of later growth.    When the education which we receive from men does not give scope to  that of nature, it is erroneous in its means and its tendency, and  enervates both the body and the mind. Nature has her way of rearing  men, as she has of healing their maladies. The art of education is to  follow her dictates, and the art of education is equally to obey her  laws. The ancient inhabitants of the Baleares followed nature in their  manner of teaching their children to be good archers, when they hung  their dinner aloft by a thread, and left them to bring it down: by  their skill in the use of the bow.    The education of nature, without any more human care than is necessary  to preserve life, makes a savage. Human education joined to that of  nature, may make a good citizen, a skilful artizan, or a well-bred  man; but a higher power is wanting in order to produce a Bacon or a  Newton.    The error of the _past_ system (for such I hope I may venture to call  it) as to _mental development_ was, that the inferior powers of the  mind were called into activity, in preference to its higher faculties.  The effort was to exercise the memory, and store it with information,  which, owing to the inactivity of the understanding and the judgment,  was seldom or never of use. To adopt the opinions of others was  thought quite enough, without the child being troubled to think for  itself, and to form an opinion of its own. But this is not as it  should be. Such a system is neither likely to produce great nor wise  men; and is much better adapted to parrots than children. Hence, the  first thing attempted in an infant school is, to set the children  thinking,--to induce them to examine, compare, and judge, in reference  to all those matters which their dawning intellects are capable of  mastering. It is of no use to tell a child, in the first place, _what  it should think_,--this is at once inducing mental indolence, which  is but too generally prevalent among adults; owing to this erroneous  method having been adopted by those who had the charge of their early  years. Were a child left to its own resources, to discover and judge  of things exclusively by itself, though the opposite evil would be  the consequence, namely, a state of comparative ignorance, yet I am  doubtful whether it would be greater or more lamentable than that  issuing from the injudicious system of giving children dogmas instead  of problems, the opinions of others instead of eliciting their own. In  the one case we should find a mind, uninformed and uncultivated, but  of a vigorous and masculine character, grasping the little knowledge  it possessed, with the power and right of a conqueror; in the other,  a memory occupied by a useless heap of notions,--without a single  opinion or idea it could call its own,--and an understanding indolent  and narrow, and, from long-indulged inactivity, almost incapable  of exertion. As the fundamental principle of the system, I would  therefore say, let the _children think for themselves_. If they arrive  at erroneous conclusions, assist them in attaining the truth; but  let them, with such assistance, arrive at it by their own exertions.  Little good will be done, if you say to a child,--_That_ is wrong,  _this_ is right, unless you enable it to perceive the error of the  one and the truth of the other. It is not only due to the child as a  rational being that you should act so, but it is essentially necessary  to the development of its intellectual faculties. It were not more  ridiculous for a master, in teaching arithmetic, to give his pupil the  problem and answer, without instructing him in the method of working  the question, than it is for a person to give a child results of  reasoning, without showing how the truth is arrived at. But some,  perhaps, will be ready to exclaim, \"Surely the teacher should not  withhold the benefit of his knowledge and experience,--the child will  have time enough to examine the merits of his information when he  grows older and be more competent to do so!\" To this I answer: in the  first place, nothing should be submitted to the child which it is not  fully competent to understand. To give the child tasks or subjects  too difficult for its mental powers, is a violation of nature; and as  foolish and detrimental as though you were to place a hundred pounds  weight on its shoulders when it is incapable of supporting ten. The  teacher's experience can only be of service to the child so far as it  is applicable to its own state; and as to postponing the period when  it is to think for itself, there is certainly no occasion for it.  Nature has provided food adapted to the powers of the infant's  stomach, and those who would rightly conduct the work of education,  should imitate her in providing its intellectual food. That this may  be done, I am attempting to shew in theory in the pages of this work;  and, that it answers equally well in practice, any one who has a  doubt, may assure himself by visiting any school conducted upon the  plan here laid down.    The charge has been brought against the system, that we are not  sufficiently anxious to teach the children to read. Now, though I may  venture to say, that under no other plan, do the children acquire a  knowledge of alphabetical characters, and the formation of words, so  soon as under the present, yet I am quite ready to concede that  I consider their learning to read a secondary object, to that of  teaching them to examine and find out the nature and properties of  things, of which words are but the _signs_. It is with _things_, and  not _words_ merely, we wish to make our children acquainted. If they  first learn the nature and properties of an object, there is no fear  of their afterwards inquiring its name; but we too frequently find,  that having acquired _names_, they are indifferent to, and forgetful  of, the objects represented.    Let children see and observe an object, and be taught the name of it  at the same time, and then both are indelibly fixed on the memory.  An infant at home is perpetually running around and looking at all  things, and hearing persons speaking about them; it soon becomes  acquainted with their names and properties, and then from time to time  speaks about them. \"Ah!\" exclaims papa or mama, \"What an old-fashioned  child that is; one would wonder where it got such notions.\" A little  thought and reflection would soon tell where, and this thought  properly carried out would display an important fundamental principle  in teaching the young mind.    Our first endeavour is, therefore, to excite a spirit of inquiry,--to  foster that curiosity which is so natural to young children: till this  is properly done, your information will not be well received, and  it is most likely soon to be forgotten; but having once made them  inquisitive, you are more likely to tire of communicating than they  are of receiving. The skilful teacher will, indeed, rather leave them  with an appetite still craving, than satiate them by repletion. I have  frequently found the most beneficial results arise from the sudden  cessation of a lesson or a lecture on an interesting topic. The  children have looked for its renewal with the utmost impatience,  pondering over what they had already heard, and anticipating what was  yet to come with the greatest interest. Give a child a _task_, and  you impose a burthen on him,--permit him to learn something, and you  confer a favour.    Having excited a spirit of inquiry, the next endeavour is to direct it  to proper objects. These, of course, will be things which relate to  the senses of the child; the nature and properties of bodies, which  may be ascertained by the application of those senses, &c. Having  induced it to examine for itself, you are now to elicit its ideas of  each object respectively; and having taught it to use its reason  and judgment freely, and to express its own notions fearlessly and  candidly,--you are to attempt the correction of what is erroneous, by  putting forth your own views in as simple a way as possible: not so as  to induce the child to give up its own opinions and adopt yours, but  in such a way as to direct it to the attainment of truth; to induce a  comparison between its thoughts and yours, and thus to discover its  own error.    The powers of observation will speedily be improved under such a  course of instruction, and in all the subsequent stages of existence,  will not fail to constitute an independent and shrewd observer. But  some may think we are straining the child's faculties by the plan  recommended,--overstepping nature's laws,--and that the result must be  detrimental to the child, both in mind and body. So far, however, is  this from being true, that we have taken nature for our guide. We  deprecate strongly, most strongly, that unnatural system, which  gives children tasks so far beyond their powers, and for which their  infantile faculties are not qualified;--we would lead them on in the  path which nature has marked out--step by step--taking care that one  thing should be thoroughly mastered before another is attempted.    The mental powers of children are far stronger than is generally  supposed. No one who looks back to his early childhood, can fail of  recollecting, that, at times, his thoughts would even then reach  the very limits of human thought. All the powers of mind that are  exercised in after-life display themselves in infancy, and therefore  they all ought to be quietly and easily brought into exercise.

PART VI    Bagobo Myths    By Laura Watson Benedict    The following stories were obtained from the Bagobo people, one of  the groups of pagan Malays in southeastern Mindanao, Philippine  Islands. Their habitat is on the eastern folds of the Cabadangan  mountain-range, in the vicinity of Mount Apo, the highest peak,  and on the foothills thence sloping down to the west coast of the  Gulf of Davao. They practise a primitive agriculture--raising corn,  rice, camotes, and several vegetables--in fields and little gardens  at the edge of the forests. Their garments are of home-grown hemp;  and their artistic interests centre largely around the decorative  designs produced in dyeing, weaving, and embroidery.    In spite of physical barriers interposed by mountain-spurs, frequent  swift-flowing rivers, and dense undergrowth in the forests, there  is considerable intercourse between the small villages, each of  which contains from two to twenty or more houses. The people take  long journeys on horse and on foot over the trails to assemble at  ceremonial festivals and for purposes of trade, as well as for social  visiting. On such occasions, stories and songs are repeated.    That the component parts of the stories have been drawn from  numerous and widely separated sources, is apparent, even at a  cursory glance. Among these sources, the folk-lore material of  Sanscrit writers seems to have left a distinctive impress upon the  Bagobo mythical romance. Against a Malay background, and blended  with native pagan elements, are presented chains of episodes,  characteristic personalities, methods for securing a magical control  of the situation, that suggest vividly parallel literary forms in  the Sanscrit saga. Still more, one is conscious of a prevailing  Indian atmosphere, that may sometimes elude analysis, yet none the  less fails not to make itself felt. But as to the line of ethnic  contacts which has transfused this peculiar literary quality into Malay  myth,--whether it is to be traced solely to the influence exerted by  Hindoo religion and Hindoo literature during ages of domination in  the Malay archipelago, or whether we must reconsider the hypothesis  of an Indonesian migration,--this is a problem of great complexity,  for which no satisfactory solution has yet been offered.    Modern foreign increments that have filtered into the stories from  the folk-lore of neighboring wild tribes--notably that of the Bilan,  the Tagacolo, and, to a less extent, the Culaman and Ata--will have  to be sifted out eventually. In illustration of this point, one tale  known to be outside of Bagobo sources is here introduced. The story  of \"Alelu'k and Alebu'tud\" was told by an Ata boy to a Bagobo at the  coast, who immediately related it to me. It was unquestionably passed  on in Bagobo circles, and has become a permanent accession. Yet this  was the sole case that came under my observation of a social visit made  by an Ata in a Bagobo house; for the Ata live far to the northwest  of the Bagobo, and are extremely timid, and \"wild\" in the popular  sense. Recent ethnic influences from higher peoples, pre-eminently  the Moro and the Spaniard, will have to be reckoned with. The story of  \"The Monkey and the Turtle\" is clearly modified from a Spanish source.    The myths here presented include only those of which no texts were  recorded. A part of the material was given in the vernacular and  interpreted by a Bagobo; a part was told in English, or in mixed  English and Bagobo. The stories were taken down in 1907, on Mount  Merar in the district of Talun, and at Santa Cruz on the coast.    As regards subject-matter, the stories (ituran [27]) tend to cluster  into groups fairly distinguishable in type. Foremost in significance  for the cultural tradition of the people is the ulit, a long, romantic  tale relating in highly picturesque language the adventures of the  mythical Bagobo, who lived somewhere back in the hazy past, before  existing conditions were established. Semi-divine some of them were,  or men possessing magical power. The old Mona people; the Malaki,  who portrayed the Bagobo's ideal of manhood; and the noble lady called  Bia,--these and other well-marked characters figure in the ulit.    Another class of stories deals with the demons known as Buso, who  haunt graveyards, forests, and rocks. These tales have been built up  by numerous accretions from the folk-lore of many generations. The  fear of Buso is an ever-present element in the mental associations of  the Bagobo, and a definite factor in shaping ritual forms and magical  usages. But the story-teller delights to represent Buso as tricked,  fooled, brought into embarrassing situations.    Still another type of myth is associated with cosmogony and natural  phenomena. It is probable that more extended research would disclose a  complete cosmogonic myth to replace the somewhat fragmentary material  here offered.    The number of explanatory animal tales thus far collected is  surprisingly small. Doubtless there are many more to be gathered. Yet,  in view of the comparatively scanty mammalian fauna of Mindanao,  we might anticipate a somewhat limited range of animal subjects.    It will be observed that these groups of stories, tentatively thus  classified for convenience, are not separated by sharp lines. Buso  figures prominently in the ulit; animals play the part of heroes in  Buso tales; while in nature myths the traditional Mona are more or  less closely associated with the shifting of sky and sun. But this  is merely equivalent to saying that all the tales hang together.    A word as to the form of the stories and the manner of narration. Here  we find two distinct styles dependent on the content of the myth. The  tales of animals, cosmogonic myths, and the folk-lore of Buso,  are all told in prose, with many inflections of the voice, and often  accompanied by an animated play of dramatic gesture. In marked contrast  is the style of the mythical romance, or ulit, which is recited in a  rapid monotone, without change of pitch, with no gestures, and with a  regard to accent and quantity that gives a rhythmic swing suggestive  of a metrical rendering.    Although Bagobo songs are often designated as men's songs and women's  songs, in the case of the stories I have found as yet no monopoly by  either sex of any special type. The ulit, however, is often told by a  young woman just after she leaves the loom, when darkness drops. She  sits on the floor, or lies on her back with hands clasped behind  her head, and pours out her story in an unbroken flow to the eager  young men and girls who gather to listen. Again, I have seen a girl  of thirteen the sole auditor while a boy but little older than she  rolled off an ulit that seemed interminable, with never a pause for  breath. The children did not glance at each other; but the face of  each was all alight with joy at the tale.      CHAPTER I    Myths Associated with Natural Phenomena      Cosmogony    In the beginning, Diwata [28] made the sea and the land, and planted  trees of many kinds. Then he took two lumps of earth, [29] and shaped  them like human figures; then he spit on them, and they became  man and woman. The old man was called Tuglay, and the old woman,  Tuglibung. [30] The two were married, and lived together. The Tuglay  made a great house, and planted seeds of different kinds that Diwata  gave him.    Diwata made the sun, the moon, the stars, and the rivers. First he  made the great eel (kasili), a fish that is like a snake in the river,  and wound [31] it all around the world. Diwata then made the great crab  (kayumang), and put it near the great eel, and let it go wherever it  liked. Now, when the great crab bites the great eel, the eel wriggles,  and this produces an earthquake.    When the rain falls, it is Diwata throwing out water from the sky. When  Diwata spits, the showers fall. The sun makes yellow clouds, and the  yellow clouds make the colors of the rainbow. But the white clouds  are smoke from the fire of the gods.      In the Days of the Mona    Long ago the sun hung low over the earth. And the old woman called  Mona said to the sky, \"You go up high, because I cannot pound my rice  when you are in the way.\"    Then the sky moved up higher.    Mona [32] was the first woman, and Tuglay [33] was the first man. There  were at that time only one man and one woman on the earth. Their  eldest son was named Malaki; their eldest daughter, Bia. They lived  at the centre of the earth.    Tuglay and Mona made all the things in the world; but the god made  the woman and the man. Mona was also called Tuglibung. Tuglay and  Tuglibung got rich, because they could see the god.    But the snake was there too, and he gave the fruit to the man and the  woman, saying to them, \"If you eat the fruit, it will open your eyes.\"    Then they both ate the fruit. This made the god angry.    After this, Tuglibung and Tuglay could not see the god any more. [34]      Why the Sky Went Up    In the beginning, when the world was made, the sky lay low down  over the earth. At this time the poor families called \"Mona\" were  living in the world. The sky hung so low, that, when they wanted to  pound their rice, they had to kneel down on the ground to get a play  for the arm. Then the poor woman called Tuglibung said to the sky,  \"Go up higher! Don't you see that I cannot pound"]]]
