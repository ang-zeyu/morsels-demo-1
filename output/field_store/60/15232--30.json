Lord Curzon's fall and the extremely injudicious  references to Partition made by Mr. Brodrick, the then Secretary of  State, in the correspondence published after the resignation of the  Viceroy, had from the first given a great stimulus to the anti-Partition  campaign, Mr. Brodrick's remarks led the Bengalees to form a very  exaggerated estimate of the personal part played by Lord Curzon in the  question of Partition, and they not unnaturally concluded that, if the  Secretary of State had merely sanctioned the Partition in order to  humour the Viceroy, he might easily be induced to reconsider the matter  when once Lord Curzon had been got out of the way. Their hopes in that  quarter were, it is true, very soon dashed, but only to be strung up  again to the highest pitch of expectancy when the Conservative  Government fell from power, and was replaced by a Liberal  Administration, with Mr. John Morley at the India Office and an  overwhelming majority in the House of Commons, in which the Radical  element was very strongly represented. Several of the leading Radical  organs in England had for a long time past joined hands with the  Bengalee Press in denouncing Lord Curzon and all his works, and, most  fiercely of all, the Partition of Bengal. The Bengalee politicians,  moreover, not only had the active sympathy of a large section of Radical  opinion at home, but they had in the House itself the constant  co-operation of a small but energetic group of members, who constituted  themselves into an \"Indian party,\" and were ever ready to act as the  spokesmen of Indian discontent. Some of them were of that earnest type  of self-righteousness which loves to smell out unrighteousness in their  fellow countrymen, especially in those who are serving their country  abroad; some were hypnotized by the old shibboleths of freedom, even  when freedom merely stands for licence; some were retired Anglo-Indians,  whose experience in the public service in India would have carried  greater weight had not the peculiar acerbity of their language seemed to  betray the bitterness of personal disappointment. Every invention or  exaggeration of the Bengalee Press found its way into the list of  questions to be asked of the Secretary of State, who, with less  knowledge than he has since acquired, doubtless considered himself bound  to pass them on for inquiry to the Government of India. A large  proportion of these questions were aimed at Sir Bampfylde Fuller, who,  as the first Lieutenant-Governor of the new province of Eastern Bengal,  had been singled out for every form of vituperation and calumny, and no  subject figured more prominently amongst them than the disciplinary  treatment of turbulent schoolboys and students. It is so easy to appeal  to the generous sentiments of the British public in favour of poor boys,  supposed to be of tender years, dragged into police courts by harsh  bureaucrats for some hasty action prompted by the generous, if foolish,  exuberance of youth, especially when the British public is quite unaware  that in India most students and many schoolboys are more or less  full-grown and often already married. Every one of these questions was  duly advertised in the columns of the Bengalee Press, and their  cumulative effect was to produce the impression that the British  Parliament was following events in Bengal with feverish interest and  with overwhelming sympathy for the poor oppressed Bengalee.    Nevertheless, there came a moment when the first feverish excitement  seemed to wane. Time had gone on, and though there was a new Viceroy in  India and a new Secretary of State at Whitehall, the Partition had  remained an accomplished fact. The visit of the Prince and Princess of  Wales to Calcutta had temporarily exercised a restraining influence on  the political leaders, and the presence of Royalty in a country where  reverence for the Throne is still a powerful tradition seemed to hush  even the forces of militant sedition. In Eastern Bengal, where the  agitation had been much fiercer than in Bengal proper, the energy and  devotion displayed by the Lieutenant-Governor in fighting a serious  threat of famine had won for him the respect of many of his opponents,  and the situation was beginning to lose some of its acuteness when it  was suddenly announced that Sir Bampfylde Fuller had resigned. The  effect was instantaneous. The points at issue between Sir Bampfylde  Fuller and the Government of India have been fully and frequently  debated, and it is needless to discuss here the reasons given for his  resignation, or for its prompt acceptance by the Viceroy. What I am  concerned with is the effect produced by that incident. It was immediate  and disastrous. The Bengalee leaders took heart. They claimed Sir  Bampfylde's downfall as their triumph--theirs and their allies' at  Westminster. Those, on the other hand, who imagined that it was Sir  Bampfylde's methods that had intensified the agitation and that his  removal would restore peace--even the sort of half peace which had been  so far maintained in Bengal proper under the milder sway of Sir Andrew  Fraser--were very soon undeceived. For if for a short time Sir Bampfylde  Fuller's successor was spared, the Government of Eastern Bengal was  compelled before long to take, more vigorous measures than he had ever  contemplated, and the agitation, which had hitherto refrained from  exhibiting its more violent aspects in Bengal proper, not only ceased to  show any discrimination, but everywhere broadened and deepened. The  veteran leaders, who still posed as \"moderates,\" ceased to lead or,  swept away by the forces they had helped to raise, were compelled to  quicken their pace like the Communist leader in Paris who rushed after  his men exclaiming:--_Je suis leur chef, il faut bien que je les suive_.  The question of Partition itself receded into the background, and the  issue, until then successfully veiled and now openly raised, was not  whether Bengal should be one unpartitioned province or two partitioned  provinces under British rule, but whether British rule itself was to  endure in Bengal or, for the matter of that, anywhere in India.    The first phase of unrest in Bengal, at any rate in its outward  manifestations, had been mainly political, and on the whole free from  any open exhibition of disloyalty to the British _Raj_. With the  Partition of Bengal it passed into a second phase in which, new economic  issues were superadded to the political issues, if they did not  altogether overshadow them, and the _Swadeshi_ movement and the boycott  soon imported methods of violence and lawlessness which had hitherto  been considered foreign to the Bengalee temperament. This phase did not  last for much more than a year after the Partition, for, when once  started on the inclined plane of lawlessness, the agitation rapidly  developed into a much wider and deeper revolt, in which _Swadeshi_ held  its place, but only in a subordinate position. The revolt began rapidly  to assume the revolutionary complexion, in the religious and social as  well as in the political domain, which Tilak had for years past, as we  have seen, laboured to impart to his propaganda in the Deccan, and, as  far as his personal influence and counsels availed, in every part of  India with which he was in contact. The ground had already been prepared  for this transformation by spadework in the Bengalee Press conducted by  two of Tilak's chief disciples in Bengal. One was Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal,  the bold exponent of _Swaraj_, whose programme I have already quoted.  The other was Mr. Arabindo Ghose, one of the most remarkable figures  that Indian unrest has produced. Educated in England, and so thoroughly  that when he returned to India he found it difficult to express himself  in Bengali, he is not only a high-caste Hindu, but he is one of those  Hindu mystics who believe that, by the practice of the most extreme  forms of _Yoga_ asceticism, man can transform himself into a super-man,  and he has constituted himself the high priest of a religious revival  which has taken a profound hold on the imagination of the emotional  youth of Bengal. His ethical gospel is not devoid of grandeur. It is  based mainly on the teachings of Krishna to Arjuna as revealed in the  _Bhagvad Gita_, and I cannot hope to define its moral purpose better  than by borrowing the following sentence from Mrs. Besant's introduction  to her translation of \"The Lord's Song\":--       It is meant to lift the aspirant from the lower levels of     renunciation where objects are renounced, to the loftier     heights where desires are dead and where the Yogi dwells     in calm and ceaseless contemplation, while his body and     mind are actively employed in discharging the duties that     fall to his lot in life.    This reading of the _Bhagvad Gita_ differentiates the newer Indian  conception of renunciation, which does not exclude but rather prescribes  the duty of service to society, from the older conception, which was  concerned merely to procure the salvation of the individual by his  complete detachment from all mundane affairs. With this gospel of active  self-sacrifice none can assuredly quarrel, but it is the revolutionary  form which Mr. Arabindo Ghose would see given to such activity that,  unfortunately, chiefly fascinates the rising generation of Bengalees.  For him British rule and the Western civilization for which it stands  threaten the very life of Hinduism, and therefore British rule and all  that it stands for must go, and in order that they may go every Hindu  must be up and doing. That Mr. Arabindo Ghose himself holds violence and  murder to be justifiable forms of activity for achieving that purpose  cannot be properly alleged, for though he has several times been placed  on his trial and in one instance for actual complicity in political  crime--namely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#20)"],[1,"highly  illuminating truths and gave the psychological reasons for accents and  the physiological reasons for the gestures. He determined the use of  gestures in some sort of scientific way. Mystic fancies were mixed up in  these questions.    It was extremely interesting to see him dissect one of Fontaine's fables  or a passage from Racine, and to hear him explain why the accent should  be on such a word or on such a syllable and not on another, to bring out  the sense. Although this course was so instructive, few took it, for  Delsarte was almost unknown to people. His influence scarcely extended  outside a narrow circle of admirers, but the quality made up for the  quantity. This was the circle of the old _Debats_, which was formerly  devoted exclusively to Romanticism, but at this time to the  classics--the set headed by Ingres in painting and Reber in music.  Theirs was a secluded and ascetic world in silent revolt against the  abominations of the century. One had to hear the tone of devotion in  which the members of this circle spoke of the ancients to appreciate  their attitude. Nothing in our day can give any idea of them. \"They  say,\" one of the devotees once told me, \"that the ancients learned  Beauty through a sort of revelation, and Beauty has steadily degenerated  ever since.\"    Such false notions were, however, professed by the most sincere people  who were deeply devoted to art. So this group, which had no influence on  their own contemporaries, nevertheless, without knowing it or wishing to  do so, played a useful role.    As we know, the public was divided into two camps. On one side were the  partisans of Melody, opera-comique, the Italians, and, with some effort,  of grand opera. Opposed to them were the partisans of music in the grand  style--Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, and Sebastian Bach, although he was  little known and is less well known now.    No one gave a thought to our old French school, to the composers from  Lulli to Gluck, who produced so many excellent works. Reber showed  Delsarte the way and the latter, naturally an antiquarian, threw  himself into this unexplored field with surprising vigor. Only Lulli's  name was known, while Campra, Mondonville and the others were entirely  forgotten. Even Gluck himself had been forgotten. First editions of his  orchestral scores, which it is impossible to find to-day, sold for a few  francs at the second-hand book shops. Rameau was never mentioned.    Delsarte, handsome, eloquent, and fascinating, wielded an almost  imperial sway over his little coterie of artists. Thanks to him the lamp  of our old French school was kept dimly burning until the day when  inherent justice permitted it to be revived. In this restricted world no  evening was complete without Delsarte. He would come in with some story  of frightful throat trouble to justify his chronic lack of voice, and,  then, without any voice at all but by a kind of magic, would put  shudders into the tones of Orpheus or Eurydice. I often played his  accompaniments and he always demanded _pianissimo_.    \"But,\" I would say, \"the author has indicated _forte_.\"    \"That is true,\" he would answer, \"but in those days the harpsichord had  little depth of tone.\"    It would have been easy to answer that the accompaniment was written for  the orchestra and not for the harpsichord.    Delsarte's execution, on account of the insufficiency of his vocal  powers, was often entirely different from what the author intended.  Furthermore, he was absolutely ignorant of the correct way to interpret  the appogiatures and other marks which are not used to-day. As a result  his interpretation of the older works was inexact. But that did not  matter, for even if masterpieces are presented badly, there is always  something left. Besides, both the singer and his hearers had Faith. He  had a way of pronouncing \"Gluck\" which aroused expectation even before  one heard a note.    From time to time Delsarte gave a concert. He would come on the stage  and say that he had a bad throat, but that he would try to give  _Iphigenia's Dream_ or something of that sort. His courage would prove  to be greater than his strength and he would have to stop. He would  then fall back on old-time songs or La Fontaine's fables in which he  excelled. A skilfully studied mimicry, which seemed entirely natural,  underlay his reading. A red handkerchief, which he knew how to draw from  his pocket at just the proper moment, always excited applause.    One day he conceived the idea of giving one of Bossuet's sermons at his  concert. Religious authority was very powerful at the time and forbade  it. Yet there would have been no sacrilege, and I regretted keenly that  I could not hear this magnificent prose delivered so wonderfully. Now  that religious authority has lost its secular support, we see things in  an entirely different way. Christ, the Virgin, and the Saints walk the  stage, speak in prose or verse, and sing. It would seem that no one is  shocked for there is no protest. For my own part I must frankly confess  that such pseudo-religious exhibitions are disagreeable. They disturb me  greatly and I can see no use in them.           *       *       *       *       *    In order to foster admiration for the old masters, Delsarte conceived  the idea of publishing a collection of pieces taken from their works  right and left, and, as a result, he created his _Archives du Chant_. He  had special type made and the publication was a marvel of beautiful  typography, correctness and good taste. At the beginning of each part  was a cleverly harmonised passage of church music. The support of a  publisher was necessary for the success of such a work, but Delsarte was  his own publisher and he met with no success at all. Similar but  inferior publications have been markedly successful.    Delsarte aimed at purity of text, but his successors have been forced to  modernize the works to make them accessible for the public. This fact is  painful. In literature the texts are studied and the endeavor is to  reproduce the writer's thought as closely as possible. In music it is  entirely different. With each new edition a professor is commissioned to  supervise the work and he adds something of his own invention.    Delsarte, a singer without a voice, an imperfect musician, a doubtful  scholar, guided by an intuition which approached genius, in spite of his  numerous faults played an important role in the evolution of French  music in the Nineteenth Century. He was no ordinary man. The impression  he gave to all who knew him was of a visionary, an apostle. When one  heard him speak with his fiery enthusiasm about these works of the past  which the world had forgotten, one could but believe that such oblivion  was unjust and desire to know these relics of another age.    Without the shadow of a doubt I owed to his leadership the necessary  courage to make a profound study of the works of the old school, for  they are unattractive at first. Berlioz berated all this music. He had  seen Gluck's works on the stage in his youth, but he could see nothing  in them that was not \"superannuated and childish.\" With all respect to  Berlioz's memory, it deserved a kinder judgment than that. When one  reaches the depths of this music, although it may be at the price of  some effort, he is well repaid for his pains. There is real feeling,  grandeur and even something of the picturesque in these works--as much  as could be with the means at their disposal.    It is only right that we should pay tribute to Delsarte's memory. He  was a pioneer who, during his whole life, proclaimed the value of  immortal works, which the world despised. That is no slight merit.          CHAPTER XVII    SEGHERS      While Delsarte was preparing the way for the old French opera and above  all for Gluck's works, another pioneer of musical evolution was working  to form the taste of the Parisian public, but with an entirely different  power and another effect. Seghers was the man. He played a great role  and his memory should be honored.    As his name indicates, Seghers was a Belgian. He started life as a  violinist and was one of Baillot's pupils. His execution was masterly,  his tone admirable, and he had a musical intelligence of the first  order. He had every right to a first rank among _virtuosi_, but this  man, herculean in appearance and tenacious in his purposes, lost all his  power before an audience.    He had a dream of giving to lovers of music the last of Beethoven's  quartets, which were considered at the time both unplayable and  incomprehensible. In the end he planned a series of concerts at which,  despite my age--I was only fifteen--I was to be the regular pianist. He  planned to give in addition to these quartets, some of Bach's sonatas  and Reber's and Schumann's trios. I spoke of this plan to his  mother-in-law one day as she was peacefully embroidering at the window,  and told her how pleased I was at the thought of the concerts.    \"Don't count on it too much,\" she told me. \"He'll never give them.\"    When everything was ready, he invited some thirty people to listen to a  trial performance. It was wretched. All the depth of tone had gone from  his violin as well as the skill from his fingers.... The project was  abandoned.    It was left for Maurin to make something out of these terrible quartets.  Maurin had peculiar gifts. He had a lightness of bow which I have never  seen equalled by anyone and a lightness and charm which enchanted the  public. But I can say in all sincerity that Seghers's execution was even  better. Unfortunately for him I was his only listener.    Madame Seghers was a woman of great beauty, unusually intelligent and  distinguished. She had been one of Liszt's pupils and was a pianist of  first rank. But she was even more timid than her husband--a single  listener was sufficient to paralyze her. When Liszt was teaching Madame  Seghers, he came "]]]
