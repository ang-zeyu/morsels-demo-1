The Narrative of which meeting of theirs, we  shall now (God willing) relate.    Sec. 98. They say that there was an Island not far from that where _Hai Ebn  Yokdhan_ was born (no matter according to which of those two different  Accounts they give of his Birth) into which one of those good Sects,  which had some one of the ancient Prophets (of pious Memory) for its  Author, had retir'd. A Sect which us'd to discourse of all things in  Nature, by way of Parable and Similitude, and by that means represent  the Images of them to the Imagination, and fix the Impressions of them  in Men's Minds, as is customary in such Discourses as are made to the  Vulgar. This Sect so spread it self in this Island, and prevail'd and  grew so eminent, that at last the King not only embrac'd it himself, but  oblig'd his Subjects to do so too.    Sec. 99. Now there were born in this Island, two Men of extraordinary  Endowments, and Lovers of that which is Good; the Name of the one was  _Asal_, and the other _Salaman_, who meeting with this Sect, embrac'd it  heartily, and oblig'd themselves to the punctual Observance of all its  Ordinances, and the daily Exercise of what was practis'd in it; and to  this end they enter'd into a League of Friendship with each other. Now  among other Passages contain'd in the Law of that Sect, they sometimes  made enquiry into these Words, wherein it treats of the Description of  the most High and Glorious God, and. his Angels, and the Resurrection,  and the Rewards and Punishments of a future State. Now _Asal_ us'd to  make a deeper Search into the inside of Things, and was more inclin'd to  study Mystical Meanings and Interpretations. But as for his Friend  _Salaman_, he kept close to the literal Sense, and never troubled  himself with such Interpretations, but refrain'd from such curious  Examination and Speculation of things. However, notwithstanding this  Difference, they both were constant in performing those Ceremonies  requir'd, and in calling themselves to an account, and in opposing their  Affections.    Sec. 100. Now there were in this Law some Passages which seem'd to exhort  Men to Retirement and a solitary Life, intimating that Happiness and  Salvation were to be attain'd by it; and others which seem'd to  encourage Men to Conversation, and the embracing Human Society. _Asal_  gave himself up wholly to Retirement, and those Expressions which  favour'd it were of most weight with him, because he was naturally  inclin'd to Contemplation, and searching into the Meanings of Things;  and his greatest hope was, that he should best attain his End by a  solitary Life. _Salaman,_ on the other side, applied himself to  Conversation, and those Sayings of the Law which tended that way, went  the farthest with him; because he had a natural Aversion to  Contemplation, and nice sifting of things. And he thought that  Conversation did drive away evil Thoughts, and banish'd that Diversity  of Opinions which offer'd themselves to his Mind, and kept him from the  Suggestions of evil Thoughts. In short, their Disagreement in this  particular, was the occasion of their parting.    Sec. 101. Now _Asal_ had heard of that Island, in which we have told you  that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ had his Breeding. He knew also its Fertility and  Conveniences, and the healthful Temper of the Air, so that it would  afford him such a commodious Retirement as he had in his Wishes. Thither  he resolv'd to go, and withdraw himself from all manner of Conversation,  the remaining part of his Days. So he took what Substance he had, and  with part of it he hir'd a Ship to convey him thither, the rest he  distributed among the poor people, and took his leave of his Friend  _Salaman_, and went aboard. The Mariners transported him to the Island,  and set him a-shore and left him. There he continu'd serving God, and  magnifying him, and fancifying him, and meditating upon his glorious  Names and Attributes, without any Interruption or Disturbance. And when  he was hungry, he took what he had occasion for to satisfie his Hunger,  of such Fruits as the Island afforded, or what he could hunt. And in  this State he continu'd a while, in the mean time enjoying the greatest  Pleasure imaginable, and the most entire Tranquillity of Mind, arising  from the Converse and Communication which he had with his Lord; and  every Day experiencing his Benefits and precious Gifts, and his bringing  easily to his hand such things as he wanted, and were necessary for his  Support, which confirm'd his Belief in him, and was a great Refreshment  to him.    Sec. 102. _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_, in the mean time, was wholly immers'd in his  sublime Speculations, and never stirr'd out of his Cell but once a Week,  to take such Provision as first came to hand. So that _Asal_ did not  light upon him at first, but walk'd round the Island, and compass'd the  Extremities of it, without seeing any Man, or so much as the Footsteps  of any: Upon which account his Joy was increas'd, and his Mind  exceedingly pleas'd, in regard of his comparing that which he had  propos'd to himself, namely, to lead the most retired Life that was  possible.    Sec. 103. At last it happen'd, one time that _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ coming out  to look for Provision in the the same place whither _Asal_ was retired,  they spy'd one another. _Asal_, for his part, did not question but that  it was some religious Person, who for the sake of a solitary Life, had  retir'd into that Island, as he had done himself, and was afraid, lest  if he should come up to him, and make himself known, it might spoil his  Meditation, and hinder his attaining what he hop'd for. _Hai Ebn  Yokdhan_ on the other side could not imagine what it was, for of all the  Creatures he had ever beheld in his whole Life, he had never seen any  thing like it. Now _Asal_ had a black Coat on, made with Hair and Wool,  which _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ fancied was natural, and stood wondring at it a  long time. _Asal_ ran away as hard as he could, for fear he should  disturb his Meditation; _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ ran after him, out of an  innate desire he had to know the Truth of Things. But when he perceiv'd  _Asal_ make so much haste, he retir'd a little and hid himself from him;  so that _Asal_ thought he had been quite gone off, and then he fell to  his Prayers, and Reading, and Invocation, and Weeping; and Supplication,  and Complaining, till he was altogether taken up, so as to mind nothing  else.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration 7]           *       *       *       *       *    Sec. 104. In the mean time _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ stole upon him by degrees, and  _Asal_ took no notice of him, till he came so near as to hear him read  and praise God, and observ'd his humble Behaviour, and his Weeping, and  heard a pleasant Voice and distinct Words, such as he had never observ'd  before in any kind of Animals; Then he look'd upon his Shape and  Lineaments, and perceiv'd that he was of the same Form with himself, and  was satisfied that the Coat he had on, was not a natural Skin, but an  artificial Habit like his own. And when he observ'd the Decency of his  humble Behaviour, and his Supplication and Weeping, he did not at all  question but that he was one of those Essences which had the Knowledge  of the TRUE ONE; and for that Reason he had a Desire to be acquainted  with him, and to know what was the matter with him, and what caus'd this  Weeping and Supplication. Whereupon he drew nearer to him, till _Asal_  perceiving it, betook himself to his Heels again, and _Hai Ebn  Yokdhan_(answerably to his Vigour and Power both of Knowledge and Body,  which God had bestow'd upon him) pursu'd him with all his Might, till at  last he overtook him and seiz'd on him, and held him fast, so that he  could not get away.    Sec. 105. When _Asal_ look'd upon him, and saw him cloath'd with the Skins  of wild Beasts with the Hair on, and his own Hair so long as to cover a  great part of his Body, and observ'd his great Swiftness and Strength,  he was very much afraid of him, and began to pacifie him with stroaking  him, and entreating him, but _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ did not understand one  word he said, nor knew any thing of his meaning, only he perceiv'd that  he was afraid, and endeavour'd to allay his Fear with such Voices as he  had learn'd of some of the Beasts, and stroak'd his Head, and both Sides  of his Neck, and shew'd Kindness to him, and express'd a great deal of  Gladness and Joy; till at last _Asal_'s Fear was laid aside, and he knew  that he meant him no harm.    Sec. 106. Now _Asal_ long before, out of his earnest Desire of searching  into the meaning of Things, had studied most Languages, and was well  skill'd in them. So he began to speak to _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ in all the  Languages which he understood, and ask him Questions concerning his way  of Life, and took pains to make him understand him; but all in vain, for  _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ stood all the while wondring at what he heard, and did  not know what was the meaning of it, only he perceiv'd that _Asal_ was  pleas'd, and well-affected towards him. And thus they stood wondring one  at another.    Sec. 107. Now _Asal_ had by him some Remainder of the Provision which he  had brought along with him, from the inhabited Island from whence he  came; and he offer'd it to _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_, who did not know what to  make on't, for he had never seen any such before. Then _Asal_ eat some  of it himself, and invited _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ by Signs to eat too. But  _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ bethought himself of those Rules which he had  prescrib'd to himself, as to matter of Diet; and not knowing the Nature  of that which he offer'd him, nor whether it was lawful for him to  partake of it or not, he refus'd it. _Asal_ still continu'd urgent, and  invited him kindly: Now _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ had a great Desire to be  acquainted with him, and was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#20)"],[1,"figures in  the last census are not conveniently arranged for Buddhist  statistics.]    [Footnote 180: Hastings' _Encycl. of Religion and Ethics_, art. \"Burma  (Buddhism).\"]    [Footnote 181: See Bode, _Pali Literature in Burma_, pp. 95 ff.]    [Footnote 182: No less than 22 translations of it have been made into  Burmese.

But whereas  for the last few centuries this kingdom may be regarded as a political  and religious unit, its condition in earlier times was different and  Siamese history tells us nothing of the introduction and first  diffusion of Indian religions in the countries between India and  China.    The people commonly known as Siamese call themselves Thai which  (in the form Tai) appears to be the racial name of several tribes who  can be traced to the southern provinces of China. They spread thence,  in fanlike fashion, from Laos to Assam, and the middle section  ultimately descended the Menam to the sea. The Siamese claim to have  assumed the name Thai (free) after they threw off the yoke of the  Cambojans, but this derivation is more acceptable to politics than to  ethnology. The territories which they inhabited were known as Siem,  Syam or Syama, which is commonly identified with the Sanskrit  Syama, dark or brown.[189] But the names Shan and A-hom seem to be  variants of the same word and Syama is possibly not its origin but  a learned and artificial distortion.[190] The Lao were another  division of the same race who occupied the country now called Laos  before the Tai had moved into Siam. This movement was gradual and  until the beginning of the twelfth century they merely established  small principalities, the principal of which was Lamphun,[191] on the  western arm of the Mekong. They gradually penetrated into the kingdoms  of Svankalok, Sukhothai[192] and Lavo (Lophburi) which then were  vassals of Camboja, and they were reinforced by another body of Tais  which moved southwards early in the twelfth century. For some time the  Cambojan Empire made a successful effort to control these immigrants  but in the latter part of the thirteenth century the Siamese  definitely shook off its yoke and founded an independent state with  its capital at Sukhothai. There was probably some connection between  these events and the southern expeditions of Khubilai Khan who in 1254  conquered Talifu and set the Tai tribes in motion.    The history of their rule in Siam may be briefly described as a  succession of three kingdoms with capitals at Sukhothai, Ayuthia and  Bangkok respectively. Like the Burmese, the Siamese have annals or  chronicles. They fall into two divisions, the chronicles[193] of the  northern kingdom in three volumes which go down to the foundation of  Ayuthia and are admitted even by the Siamese to be mostly fabulous, and  the later annals in 40 volumes which were rearranged after the sack of  Ayuthia in 1767 but claim to begin with the foundation of the city.  Various opinions have been expressed as to their trustworthiness,[194]  but it is allowed by all that they must be used with caution. More  authoritative but not very early are the inscriptions set up by various  kings, of which a considerable number have been published and  translated.[195]    The early history of Sukhothai and its kings is not yet beyond dispute  but a monarch called Ramaraja or Rama Khomheng played a considerable  part in it. His identity with Phaya Ruang, who is said to have  founded the dynasty and city, has been both affirmed and denied.  Sukhothai, at least as the designation of a kingdom, seems to be much  older than his reign.[196] It was undoubtedly understood as the  equivalent of the Sanskrit Sukhodaya, but like Syama it may be an  adaptation of some native word. In an important inscription found at  Sukhothai and now preserved at Bangkok,[197] which was probably  composed about 1300 A.D., Rama Khomheng gives an account of his  kingdom. On the east it extended to the banks of the Mekhong and  beyond it to Chava (perhaps a name of Luang-Prabang): on the south to  the sea, as far as Sri Dharmaraja or Ligor: on the west to  Hamsavati or Pegu. This last statement is important for it enables  us to understand how at this period, and no doubt considerably  earlier, the Siamese were acquainted with Pali Buddhism. The king  states that hitherto his people had no alphabet but that he invented  one.[198] This script subsequently developed into the modern  Siamese writing which, though it presents many difficulties, is an  ingenious attempt to express a language with tones in an alphabet. The  vocabulary of Siamese is not homogeneous: it comprises (_a_) a  foundation of Thai, (_b_) a considerable admixture of Khmer words,  (_c_) an element borrowed from Malay and other languages, (_d_)  numerous ecclesiastical and learned terms taken from Pali and  Sanskrit. There are five tones which must be distinguished, if either  written or spoken speech is to be intelligible. This is done partly by  accents and partly by dividing the forty-four consonants (many of  which are superfluous for other purposes) into three groups, the high,  middle and deep.    The king also speaks of religion. The court and the inhabitants of  Sukhothai were devout Buddhists: they observed the season of Vassa and  celebrated the festival of Kathina with processions, concerts and  reading of the scriptures. In the city were to be seen statues of the  Buddha and scenes carved in relief, as well as large monasteries. To  the west of the city was the Forest Monastery, presented to a  distinguished elder who came from Sri Dharmaraja and had studied  the whole Tripitaka. The mention of this official and others suggests  that there was a regular hierarchy and the king relates how he exhumed  certain sacred relics and built a pagoda over them. Though there is no  direct allusion to Brahmanism, stress is laid on the worship of  spirits and devas on which the prosperity of the kingdom depends.    The form of Buddhism described seems to have differed little from the  Hinayanism found in Siam to-day. Whence did the Siamese obtain it? For  some centuries before they were known as a nation, they probably  professed some form of Indian religion. They came from the border  lands, if not from the actual territory of China, and must have been  acquainted with Chinese Buddhism. Also Burmese influence probably  reached Yunnan in the eighth century,[199] but it is not easy to say  what form of religion it brought with it. Still when the Thai entered  what is now Siam, it is likely that their religion was some form of  Buddhism. While they were subject to Camboja they must have felt the  influence of Sivaism and possibly of Mahayanist Sanskrit  Buddhism but no Pali Buddhism can have come from this quarter.[200]    Southern Siam was however to some extent affected by another wave of  Buddhism. From early times the eastern coast of India (and perhaps  Ceylon) had intercourse not only with Burma but with the Malay  Peninsula. It is proved by inscriptions that the region of Ligor,  formerly known as Sri Dharmaraja, was occupied by Hindus (who were  probably Buddhists) at least as early as the fourth century A.D.,[201]  and Buddhist inscriptions have been found on the mainland opposite  Penang. The Chinese annals allude to a change in the customs of  Camboja and I-Ching says plainly that Buddhism once nourished there  but was exterminated by a wicked king, which may mean that Hinayanist  Buddhism had spread thither from Ligor but was suppressed by a dynasty  of Sivaites. He also says that at the end of the seventh century  Hinayanism was prevalent in the islands of the Southern Sea. An  inscription of about the fourth century found in Kedah and another of  the seventh or eighth from Phra Pathom both contain the formula _Ye  dharma_, etc. The latter inscription and also one from Mergui ascribed  to the eleventh century seem to be in mixed Sanskrit and Pali. The  Sukhothai inscription summarized above tells how a learned monk was  brought thither from Ligor and clearly the Pali Buddhism of northern  Siam may have followed the same route. But it probably had also  another more important if not exclusive source, namely Burma. After  the reign of Anawrata Pali Buddhism was accepted in Burma and in what  we now call the Shan States as the religion of civilized mankind and  this conviction found its way to "]]]
