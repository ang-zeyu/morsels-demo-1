[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#20)"],[1,"several _revised  editions_ which had appeared at Boston, Philadelphia, and other places, and  against the unwarrantable liberties taken by American teachers, in altering  the work, under pretence of improving it. In this article it is stated,  \"that _the whole_ of these mutilated editions _have been seen_ and examined  by Lindley Murray himself, and that they, have met with _his decided  disapprobation_. Every rational mind,\" continue these gentlemen, \"will  agree with him, that, 'the _rights of living authors_, and the _interests  of science and literature_, demand the abolition of this _ungenerous  practice_.'\" (See this also in _Murray's Key_, 12mo, N. Y., 1811, p. iii.)  Here, then, we have the feeling and opinion of Murray himself, upon this  tender point of right. Here we see the tables turned, and other men judging  it \"scarcely necessary to apologize for the use which _they have made_ of  their predecessors' labours.\"    18. It is really remarkable to find an author and his admirers so much at  variance, as are Murray and his commenders, in relation to his grammatical  authorship; and yet, under what circumstances could men have stronger  desires to avoid apparent contradiction? They, on the one side, claim for  him the highest degree of merit as a grammarian; and continue to applaud  his works as if nothing more could be desired in the study of English  grammar--a branch of learning which some of them are willing emphatically  to call \"_his_ science.\" He, on the contrary, to avert the charge of  plagiarism, disclaims almost every thing in which any degree of literary  merit consists; supposes it impossible to write an English grammar the  greater part of which is not a \"compilation;\" acknowledges that originality  belongs to but a small part of his own; trusts that such a general  acknowledgement will protect him from all censure; suppresses the names of  other writers, and leaves his examples to rest solely on his own authority;  and, \"contented with the great respectability of his private character and  station, is satisfied with being _useful_ as an author.\"--_The Friend_,  Vol. iii, p. 33. By the high praises bestowed upon his works, his own voice  is overborne: the trumpet of fame has drowned it. His liberal authorship is  profitable in trade, and interest has power to swell and prolong the  strain.    19. The name and character of Lindley Murray are too venerable to allow us  to approach even the errors of his grammars, without some recognition of  the respect due to his personal virtues and benevolent intentions. For the  private virtues of Murray, I entertain as cordial a respect as any other  man. Nothing is argued against these, even if it be proved that causes  independent of true literary merit have given him his great and unexpected  fame as a grammarian. It is not intended by the introduction of these  notices, to impute to him any thing more or less than what his own words  plainly imply; except those inaccuracies and deficiencies which still  disgrace his work as a literary performance, and which of course he did not  discover. He himself knew that he had not brought the book to such  perfection as has been ascribed to it; for, by way of apology for his  frequent alterations, he says, \"Works of this nature admit of repeated  improvements; and are, perhaps, never complete.\" Necessity has urged this  reasoning upon me. I am as far from any invidious feeling, or any sordid  motive, as was Lindley Murray. But it is due to truth, to correct erroneous  impressions; and, in order to obtain from some an impartial examination of  the following pages, it seemed necessary first to convince them, _that it  is possible_ to compose a better grammar than Murray's, without being  particularly indebted to him. If this treatise is not such, a great deal of  time has been thrown away upon a useless project; and if it is, the  achievement is no fit subject for either pride or envy. It differs from  his, and from all the pretended amendments of his, as a new map, drawn from  actual and minute surveys, differs from an old one, compiled chiefly from  others still older and confessedly still more imperfect. The region and the  scope are essentially the same; the tracing and the colouring are more  original; and (if the reader can pardon the suggestion) perhaps more  accurate and vivid.    20. He who makes a new grammar, does nothing for the advancement of  learning, unless his performance excel all earlier ones designed for the  same purpose; and nothing for his own honour, unless such excellence result  from the exercise of his own ingenuity and taste. A good style naturally  commends itself to every reader--even to him who cannot tell why it is  worthy of preference. Hence there is reason to believe, that the true  principles of practical grammar, deduced from custom and sanctioned by  time, will never be generally superseded by any thing which individual  caprice may substitute. In the republic of letters, there will always be  some who can distinguish merit; and it is impossible that these should ever  be converted to any whimsical theory of language, which goes to make void  the learning of past ages. There will always be some who can discern the  difference between originality of style, and innovation in  doctrine,--between a due regard to the opinions of others, and an actual  usurpation of their text; and it is incredible that these should ever be  satisfied with any mere compilation of grammar, or with any such authorship  as either confesses or betrays the writer's own incompetence. For it is not  true, that, \"an English grammar must necessarily be,\" in any considerable  degree, if at all, \"a compilation;\" nay, on such a theme, and in \"the  grammatical part\" of the work, all compilation beyond a fair use of  authorities regularly quoted, or of materials either voluntarily furnished  or free to all, most unavoidably implies--not conscious \"ability,\"  generously doing honour to rival merit--nor \"exemplary diffidence,\"  modestly veiling its own--but inadequate skill and inferior talents,  bribing the public by the spoils of genius, and seeking precedence by such  means as not even the purest desire of doing good can justify.    21. Among the professed copiers of Murray, there is not one to whom the  foregoing remarks do not apply, as forcibly as to him. For no one of them  all has attempted any thing more honourable to himself, or more beneficial  to the public, than what their master had before achieved; nor is there any  one, who, with the same disinterestedness, has guarded his design from the  imputation of a pecuniary motive. It is comical to observe what they say in  their prefaces. Between praise to sustain their choice of a model, and  blame to make room for their pretended amendments, they are often placed in  as awkward a dilemma, as that which was contrived when grammar was  identified with compilation. I should have much to say, were I to show them  all in their true light.[9] Few of them have had such success as to be  worthy of notice here; but the names of many will find frequent place in my  code of false grammar. The one who seems to be now taking the lead in fame  and revenue, filled with glad wonder at his own popularity, is SAMUEL  KIRKHAM. Upon this gentleman's performance, I shall therefore bestow a few  brief observations. If I do not overrate this author's literary importance,  a fair exhibition of the character of his grammar, may be made an  instructive lesson to some of our modern literati. The book is a striking  sample of a numerous species.    22. Kirkham's treatise is entitled, \"English Grammar _in familiar  Lectures_, accompanied by a _Compendium_;\" that is, by a folded sheet. Of  this work, of which I have recently seen copies purporting to be of the  \"SIXTY-SEVENTH EDITION,\" and others again of the \"HUNDRED AND FIFTH  EDITION,\" each published at Baltimore in 1835, I can give no earlier  account, than what may be derived from the \"SECOND EDITION, enlarged and  much improved,\" which was published at Harrisburg in 1825. The preface,  which appears to have been written for his _first_ edition, is dated,  \"Fredericktown, Md., August 22, 1823.\" In it, there is no recognition of  any obligation to Murray, or to any other grammarian in particular; but  with the modest assumption, that the style of the \"best philologists,\"  needed to be retouched, the book is presented to the world under the  following pretensions:    \"The author of this production has endeavoured to condense _all the most  important subject-matter of the whole science_, and present it in so small  a compass that the learner can become familiarly acquainted with it in a  _short time_. He makes but small pretensions to originality in theoretical  matter. Most of the principles laid down, have been selected from our _best  modern philologists_. If his work is entitled to any degree of _merit_, it  is not on account of a judicious selection of principles and rules, but for  the easy mode adopted of communicating _these_ to the mind of the  learner.\"--_Kirkham's Grammar_, 1825, p. 10.    23. It will be found on examination, that what this author regarded as  _\"all the most important subject-matter of the whole science\" of grammar_,  included nothing more than the most common elements of the orthography,  etymology, and syntax, of the English tongue--beyond which his scholarship  appears not to have extended. Whatsoever relates to derivation, to the  sounds of the letters, to prosody, (as punctuation, utterance, figures,  versification, and poetic diction,) found no place in his \"comprehensive  system of grammar;\" nor do his later editions treat any of these things  amply or well. In short, he treats nothing well; for he is a bad writer.  Commencing his career of authorship under circumstances the most  forbidding, yet receiving encouragement from commendations bestowed in  pity, he proceeded, like a man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#20)"],[1,"  I should do, for the swagmen kept the squatters--as, had the squatters  not monopolized the land, the swagmen would have had plenty. A moiety of  the last-mentioned--dirty, besotted, ragged creatures--had a glare in  their eyes which made one shudder to look at them, and, while  spasmodically twirling their billies or clenching their fists, talked  wildly of making one to \"bust up the damn banks\", or to drive all the  present squatters out of the country and put the people on the  land--clearly showing that, because they had failed for one reason or  another, it had maddened them to see others succeed.    In a wide young country of boundless resources, why is this thing? This  question worried me. Our legislators are unable or unwilling to cope  with it. They trouble not to be patriots and statesmen. Australia can  bring forth writers, orators, financiers, singers, musicians, actors,  and athletes which are second to none of any nation under the sun. Why  can she not bear sons, men of soul, mind, truth, godliness, and  patriotism sufficient to rise and cast off the grim shackles which widen  round us day by day?    I was the only one at Caddagat who held these silly ideas. Harold  Beecham, uncle Julius, grannie, and Frank Hawden did not worry about the  cause of tramps. They simply termed them a lazy lot of sneaking  creatures, fed them, and thought no more of the matter.    I broached the subject to uncle Jay-Jay once, simply to discover his  ideas thereon.    I was sitting on a chair in the veranda sewing; he, with his head on a  cushion, was comfortably stretched on a rug on the floor.    \"Uncle Boss, why can't something be done for tramps?\"    \"How done for 'em?\"    \"Couldn't some means of employing them be arrived at?\"    \"Work!\" he ejaculated. \"That's the very thing the crawling divils are  terrified they might get.\"    \"Yes; but couldn't some law be made to help them?\"    \"A law to make me cut up Caddagat and give ten of 'em each a piece, and  go on the wallaby myself, I suppose?\"    \"No, uncle; but there was a poor young fellow here this morning who, I  feel sure, was in earnest when he asked for work.\"    \"Helen!\" bawled uncle Jay-Jay.    \"Well, what is it?\" she inquired, appearing in the doorway.    \"Next time Sybylla is giving a tramp some tucker, you keep a sharp eye  on her or she will be sloping one of these days. There was a young  fellow here today with a scarlet moustache and green eyes, and she's  dean gone on him, and has been bullying me to give him half Caddagat.\"    \"What a disgusting thing to say! Uncle, you ought to be ashamed of  yourself,\" I exclaimed.    \"Very well, I'll be careful,\" said aunt Helen, departing.    \"What with the damned flies, and the tramps, and a pesky thing called  Sybylla, a man's life ain't worth a penny to him,\" said uncle.    We fell into silence, which was broken presently by a dirty red-bearded  face appearing over the garden gate, and a man's voice:    \"Good day, boss! Give us a chew of tobaccer?\"    \"I'm not the boss,\" said uncle with assumed fierceness.    \"Then who is?\" inquired the man.    Uncle pointed his thumb at me, and, rolling out on the floor again as  though very sleepy, began to snore. The tramp grinned, and made his  request of me. I took him round to the back, served him with flour,  beef, and an inch or two of rank tobacco out of a keg which had been  bought for the purpose. Refusing a drink of milk which I offered, he  resumed his endless tramp with a \"So long, little missy. God bless your  pleasant face.\"    I watched him out of sight. One of my brothers--one of God's children  under the Southern Cross. Did these old fellows really believe in the  God whose name they mentioned so glibly? I wondered. But I am thankful  that while at Caddagat it was only rarely that my old top-heavy thoughts  troubled me. Life was so pleasant that I was content merely to be  young--a chit in the first flush of teens, health, hope, happiness,  youth--a heedless creature recking not for the morrow.          CHAPTER FIFTEEN    When the Heart is Young      About a week or so after I first met Harold Beecham, aunt Helen allowed  me to read a letter she had received from the elder of the two Misses  Beecham. It ran as follows:      \"My dearest Helen,    \"This is a begging letter, and I am writing another to your mother at  the same time. I am asking her to allow her grand-daughter to spend a  few weeks with me, and I want you to use your influence in the matter.  Sarah has not been well lately, and is going to Melbourne for a change,  and as I will be lonely while she is away Harold insists upon me having  someone to keep me company--you know how considerate the dear boy is. I  hardly like to ask you to spare your little girl to me. It must be a  great comfort to have her. I could have got Miss Benson to stay with me,  but Harold will not hear of her. He says she is too slow, and would give  us both the mopes. But he says your little niece will keep us all alive.  Julius was telling me the other day that he could not part with her, as  she makes 'the old barracks', as he always calls Caddagat, echo with fun  and noise. I am so looking forward to seeing her, as she is dear Lucy's  child. Give her my love,\" etc., etc., and as a postscript the letter  had--\"Harold will go up for Sybylla on Wednesday afternoon. I do hope  you will be able to spare her to me for a while.\"      \"Oh, auntie, how lovely!\" I exclaimed. \"What are you laughing at?\"    \"For whom do you think Harry wants the companion? It is nice to have an  old auntie, as a blind, is it not? Well, all is fair in love and war.  You have permission to use me in any way you like.\"    I pretended to miss her meaning.    Grannie consented to Miss Beecham's proposal, and ere the day arrived I  had a trunk packed with some lovely new dresses, and was looking forward  with great glee to my visit to Five-Bob Downs.    One o'clock on Wednesday afternoon arrived; two o'clock struck, and I  was beginning to fear no one was coming for me, when, turning to look  out the window for the eighteenth time, I saw the straight blunt nose of  Harold Beecham passing. Grannie was serving afternoon tea on the  veranda. I did not want any, so got ready while my escort was having  his.    It was rather late when we bowled away at a tremendous pace in a red  sulky, my portmanteau strapped on at the back, and a thoroughbred  American trotter, which had taken prizes at Sydney shows, harnessed to  the front. We just whizzed! It was splendid! The stones and dust rose in  a thick cloud from the whirling wheels and flying hoofs, and the posts  of the wire fence on our left passed like magic as we went. Mr Beecham  allowed me to drive after a time while he sat ready to take the reins  should an emergency arise.    It was sunset--most majestic hour of the twenty-four--when we drove up  to the great white gates which opened into the avenue leading to the  main homestead of Five-Bob Downs station--beautiful far-reaching  Five-Bob Downs! Dreamy blue hills rose behind, and wide rich flats  stretched before, through which the Yarrangung river, glazed with  sunset, could be seen like a silver snake winding between shrubberied  banks. The odour from the six-acred flower-garden was overpowering and  delightful. A breeze gently swayed the crowd of trees amid the houses,  and swept over the great orchard which sloped down from the south side  of the houses. In the fading sunlight thirty iron roofs gleamed and  glared, and seemed like a little town; and the yelp of many dogs went up  at the sound of our wheels. Ah! beautiful, beautiful Five-Bob Downs!    It seemed as though a hundred dogs leapt forth to greet us when that  gate flew open, but I subsequently discovered there were but  twenty-three.    Two female figures came out to meet us--one nearly six feet high, the  other, a tiny creature, seemed about eighteen inches, though, of course,  was more than that.    \"I've brought her, aunt Gussie,\" said Harold, jumping out of the sulky,  though not relinquishing the reins, while he kissed the taller figure,  and the small one attached itself to his leg saying, \"Dimme wide.\"    \"Hullo! Possum, why wasn't old Spanker let go? I see he's not among the  dogs,\" and my host picked the tiny individual up in his arms and got  into the sulky to give her the desired ride, while after being embraced  by Miss Beecham and lifted to the ground by her nephew, I went with the  former over an asphalted tennis-court, through the wide garden, then  across a broad veranda into the great, spreading, one-storeyed house  from which gleamed many lights.    \"I am so glad you have come, my dear. I must have a good look at you  when we get into the light. I hope you are like your mother.\"    This prospect discomfited me. I knew she would find a very ugly girl  with not the least resemblance to her pretty mother, and I cursed my  appearance under my breath.    \"Your name is Sybylla,\" Miss Beecham continued, \"Sybylla Penelope. Your  mother used to be very dear to me, but I don't know why she doesn't  write to me now. I have never seen her since her marriage. It seems  strange to think of her as the mother of eight--five boys and three  girls, is it not?\"    Miss Beecham had piloted me through a wide hall and along an extended  passage out of which a row of bedrooms opened, into one of which we  went.    \"I hope you will be comfortable here, child. You need not dress for  dinner while you are here; we never do, only on very special occasions.\"    \"Neither do we at Caddagat,\" I replied.    \"Now, child, let me have a good look at you without your hat.\"    \"Oh, please don't!\" I exclaimed, covering my face with my hands. \"I am  so dreadfully ugly that I cannot bear to have anyone look at me.\"    \"What a silly little girl! You are not like your mother, but you are not  at all plain-looking. Harold says you are the best style of girl he has  seen yet, and sing beautifully. He got a"]]]
