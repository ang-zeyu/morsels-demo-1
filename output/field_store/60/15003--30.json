So he talked to himself, and all the while I would have given a world to  pluck up heart and creep on farther; yet could not, for the deadly  sweating fear that had hold of me. Thus I lay with my face to the cliff,  and Elzevir pushing firmly in my back; and the thing that frightened me  most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of, for  had there been a piece of string, or even a thread of cotton, stretched  along to give a semblance of support, I think I could have done it; but  there was only the cliff-wall, sheer and white, against that narrowest  way, with never cranny to put a finger into. The wind was blowing in  fresh puffs, and though I did not open my eyes, I knew that it was moving  the little tufts of bent grass, and the chiding cries of the gulls  seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg, and  fling myself off on to the rocks below.    Then Elzevir spoke. 'John' he said, 'there is no time to play the woman;  another minute of this and we are lost. Pluck up thy courage, keep thy  eyes to the cliff, and forward.'    Yet I could not, but answered: 'I cannot, I cannot; if I open my eyes, or  move hand or foot, I shall fall on the rocks below.'    He waited a second, and then said: 'Nay, move thou must, and 'tis better  to risk falling now, than fall for certain with another bullet in thee  later on.' And with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it  in my coat-collar, moving backwards himself, and setting to drag me  after him.    Now, I was so besotted with fright that I would not budge an inch,  fearing to fall over if I opened my eyes. And Elzevir, for all he was so  strong, could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path. So he gave  it up, leaving go hold on me with a groan, and at that moment there rose  from the under-cliff, below a sound of voices and shouting.    'Zounds, they are down already!' cried Elzevir, 'and have found Maskew's  body; it is all up; another minute and they will see us.'    But so strange is the force of mind on body, and the power of a greater  to master a lesser fear, that when I heard those voices from below, all  fright of falling left me in a moment, and I could open my eyes without a  trace of giddiness. So I began to move forward again on hands and knees.  And Elzevir, seeing me, thought for a moment I had gone mad, and was  dragging myself over the cliff; but then saw how it was, and moved  backwards himself before me, saying in a low voice, 'Brave lad! Once  creep round this turn, and I will pick thee up again. There is but fifty  yards to go, and we shall foil these devils yet!'    Then we heard the voices again, but farther off, and not so loud; and  knew that our pursuers had left the under-cliff and turned down on to the  beach, thinking that we were hiding by the sea.    Five minutes later Elzevir stepped on to the cliff-top, with me  upon his back.    'We have made something of this throw,' he said, 'and are safe for  another hour, though I thought thy giddy head had ruined us.'    Then he put me gently upon the springy turf, and lay down himself upon  his back, stretching his arms out straight on either side, and breathing  hard to recover from the task he had performed.           *       *       *       *       *    The day was still young, and far below us was stretched the moving floor  of the Channel, with a silver-grey film of night-mists not yet lifted in  the offing. A hummocky up-and-down line of cliffs, all projections,  dents, bays, and hollows, trended southward till it ended in the great  bluff of St. Alban's Head, ten miles away. The cliff-face was gleaming  white, the sea tawny inshore, but purest blue outside, with the straight  sunpath across it, spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back.    The relief of being once more on firm ground, and the exultation of an  escape from immediate danger, removed my pain and made me forget that my  leg was broken. So I lay for a moment basking in the sun; and the wind,  which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge,  seemed now but the gentlest of breezes, fresh with the breath of the  kindly sea. But this was only for a moment, for the anguish came back  and grew apace, and I fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in.  How things had been against us in these last days! First there was losing  the Why Not? and that was bad enough; second, there was the being known  by the Excise for smugglers, and perhaps for murderers; third and last,  there was the breaking of my leg, which made escape so difficult. But,  most of all, there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against  the morning sun, and I thought of all it meant for Grace, and would have  given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy.    Then Elzevir sat up, stretching himself like one waking out of sleep, and  said: 'We must be gone. They will not be back for some time yet, and,  when they come, will not think to search closely for us hereabouts; but  that we cannot risk, and must get clear away. This leg of thine will keep  us tied for weeks, and we must find some place where we can lie hid, and  tend it. Now, I know such a hiding-hole in Purbeck, which they call  Joseph's Pit, and thither we must go; but it will take all the day to get  there, for it is seven miles off, and I am older than I was, and thou too  heavy a babe to carry over lightly.'    I did not know the pit he spoke of, but was glad to hear of some place,  however far off, where I could lie still and get ease from the pain. And  so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields.    I need not tell of that weary journey, and indeed could not, if I wished;  for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish  that I knew nothing except when some unlooked-for movement gave me a  sharper twinge, and made me cry out. At first Elzevir walked briskly, but  as the day wore on went slower, and was fain more than once to put me  down and rest, till at last he could only carry me a hundred yards at a  time. It was after noon, for the sun was past the meridian, and very hot  for the time of year, when the face of the country began to change; and  instead of the short sward of the open down, sprinkled with tiny white  snail-shells, the ground was brashy with flat stones, and divided up into  tillage fields. It was a bleak wide-bitten place enough, looking as if  'twould never pay for turning, and instead of hedges there were dreary  walls built of dry stone without mortar. Behind one of these walls,  broken down in places, but held together with straggling ivy, and  buttressed here and there with a bramble-bush, Elzevir put me down at  length and said, 'I am beat, and can carry thee no farther for this  present, though there is not now much farther to go. We have passed  Purbeck Gates, and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any  chance comer pass along the down. And as for the soldiers, they are not  like to come this way so soon, and if they come I cannot help it; for  weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead. A score of  years ago I would have laughed at such a task, but now 'tis different,  and I must take a little sleep and rest till the air is cooler. So sit  thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall, and thus thou canst  look through this broken place and watch both ways. Then, if thou see  aught moving, wake me up.--I wish I had a thimbleful of powder to make  this whistle sound'--and he took Maskew's silver-butted pistol again from  his bosom, and handled it lovingly,--'tis like my evil luck to carry  fire-arms thirty years, and leave them at home at a pinch like this.'  With that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close  against the bottom of the wall, and in a minute I knew from his heavy  breathing that he was asleep.    The wind had freshened much, and was blowing strong from the west; and  now that I was under the lee of the wall I began to perceive that  drowsiness creeping upon me which overtakes a man who has been tousled  for an hour or two by the wind, and gets at length into shelter.  Moreover, though I was not tired by grievous toil like Elzevir, I had  passed a night without sleep, and felt besides the weariness of pain to  lull me to slumber. So it was, that before a quarter of an hour was past,  I had much ado to keep awake, for all I knew that I was left on guard.  Then I sought something to fix my thoughts, and looking on that side of  the wall where the sward was, fell to counting the mole-hills that were  cast up in numbers thereabout. And when I had exhausted them, and  reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth, that lay  at random on the green turf, I turned my eyes to the tillage field on the  other side of the wall, and saw the inch-high blades of corn coming up  between the stones. Then I fell to counting the blades, feeling glad to  have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty, but  would go on for millions, and millions, and millions; and before I had  reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep.    A sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg,  and though I could see nothing, I knew that a shot had been fired very  near us. I was for waking Elzevir, but he was already full awake, and put  a finger on his lip to show I should not speak. Then he crept a few paces  down the wall to where an ivy bush over-topped it, enough for him to look  through the leaves without being seen. He dropped down again with a look  of relief, and said, ''Tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss; we  will not stir unless he makes this way.'    A minute later he said: 'The boy is coming straight for the wall; we  shall have to show ourselves'; and while he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#20)"],[1,"claim have you upon knighthood,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"who would  attack a single knight, three men against one man?\"    Then the other of those knights who had been staggered by Sir Launcelot's  blow, but who had by now somewhat recovered himself, came and kneeled to  Sir Launcelot, and said: \"Sir, spare his life, for we all yield ourselves  unto you, for certes, you are the greatest champion in all the world.\"    Then Sir Launcelot was appeased, but he said: \"Nay, I will not take your  yielding unto me. For as you three assaulted this single knight, so shall  you all three yield to him.\"    \"Messire,\" said the knight who kneeled: \"I am very loth to yield us to that  knight, for we chased him hither, and he fled from us, and we would have  overcome him had you not come to his aid.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I care nothing for all that, but only that you  do as I will. And if ye do not do it, then I must perforce slay your  companions and you two. Wherefore you may take your choice.\"    [Sidenote: The three knights must yield to the one knight] Then said that  knight who kneeled: \"Messire, I see no other thing to do than to yield us  as you would have, wherefore we submit ourselves unto this knight whom you  have rescued from us.\"    Then Sir Launcelot turned to that knight to whom he had brought aid in that  matter, and he said: \"Sir Knight, these knights yield themselves unto you  to do as you command them. Now I pray you of your courtesy to tell me your  name and who you are.\"    \"Sir,\" said that knight, \"I am Sir Kay the Seneschal, and am King Arthur's  foster-brother, and a knight of the Round Table. I have been errant now for  some time in search of Sir Launcelot of the Lake. Now, I deem either that  you are Sir Launcelot, or else that you are the peer of Sir Launcelot.\"    \"Thou art right, Sir Kay,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"and I am Sir Launcelot of  the Lake.\" So thereat they two made great joy over one another, and  embraced one another as brothers-in-arms should do.    Then Sir Kay told Sir Launcelot how it was with those three knights who had  assailed him; that they were three brethren, and that he had overthrown the  fourth brother in an adventure at arms and had hurt him very sorely  thereby. So those three had been pursuing him for three days with intent to  do him a harm.    [Sidenote: Sir Kay taketh submission of the three knights] Now Sir Kay was  very loath to take submission of those three knights, but Sir Launcelot  would have it so and no other way. So Sir Kay consented to let it be as Sir  Launcelot willed. Thereupon those three knights came and submitted  themselves to Sir Kay, and Sir Kay ordained that they should go to Camelot  and lay their case before King Arthur, and that King Arthur should adjudge  their case according to what he considered to be right and fitting.    Then those three knights mounted upon their horses and rode away, and when  they had done so the gates of the manor were opened, and Sir Launcelot and  Sir Kay entered in. But when the old lady who was his hostess beheld Sir  Launcelot come in, she was very greatly astonished, for she wist he was  still asleep in his bed-chamber. Wherefore she said: \"Sir, methought you  were in bed and asleep.\" \"So indeed I was,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"but when I  saw this knight in peril of his life against three knights, I leaped out of  my window and went to his aid.\" \"Well,\" said his hostess, \"meseems that you  will sometime be a very good knight, if you have so much courage whilst you  are so young.\" And at that both Sir Launcelot and Sir Kay laughed a great  deal.    Then the chatelaine set bread and wine before Sir Kay, and he ate and  refreshed himself, and thereafter he and Sir Launcelot went to that garret  above the gate, and there fell asleep with great ease of body.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot takes Sir Kay's armor] Now before the sun arose  Sir Launcelot awoke but Sir Kay still slept very soundly. Then Sir  Launcelot beheld how Sir Kay slept, and he had a mind for a jest. So he  clad himself in Sir Kay's armor altogether from head to foot, and he took  Sir Kay's shield and spear, and he left his armor and shield and spear for  Sir Kay to use. Then he went very softly from that room, and left Sir Kay  still sleeping. And he took Sir Kay's horse and mounted upon it and rode  away; and all that while Sir Kay knew not what had befallen, but slept very  deeply.    Now after a while Sir Kay awoke, and he found that Sir Launcelot was gone,  and when he looked he found that his own armor was gone and that Sir  Launcelot's armor was left. Then he wist what Sir Launcelot had done, and  he said: \"Ha! what a noble, courteous knight is the gentleman. For he hath  left me his armor for my protection, and whilst I wear it and carry his  shield and ride his horse, it is not likely that anyone will assail me upon  my way. As for those who assail him, I do not believe that they will be  likely to find great pleasure in their battle.\"    Therewith he arose and clad himself in Sir Launcelot's armor, and after he  had broken his fast he thanked his hostess for what she had given him, and  rode upon his way with great content of spirit.    (And it was as Sir Kay had said, for when he met other knights upon the  road, and when they beheld the figure upon his shield, they all said: \"It  is not well to meddle with that knight, for that is Sir Launcelot.\" And so  he came to Camelot without having to do battle with any man.)    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot travels toward Camelot] As for Sir Launcelot,  he rode upon his way with great cheerfulness of spirit, taking no heed at  all of any trouble in the world, but chanting to himself as he rode in the  pleasant weather. But ever he made his way toward Camelot, for he said: \"I  will return to Camelot for a little, and see how it fares with my friends  at the court of the King.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot perceives three knights at feast] So by and by he  entered into the country around about Camelot, which is a very smooth and  fertile country, full of fair rivers and meadows with many cots and  hamlets, and with fair hedge-bordered highways, wonderfully pleasant to  journey in. So travelling he came to a very large meadow where were several  groves of trees standing here and there along by a river. And as he went  through this meadow he saw before him a long bridge, and at the farther  side of the bridge were three pavilions of silk of divers colors, which  pavilions had been cast in the shade of a grove of beech-trees. In front of  each pavilion stood a great spear thrust in the earth, and from the spear  hung the shield of the knight to whom the pavilion belonged. These shields  Sir Launcelot read very easily, and so knew the knights who were there. To  wit: that they were Sir Gunther, Sir Gylmere, and Sir Raynold, who were  three brothers of the Court of King Arthur. As Sir Launcelot passed their  pavilions, he saw that the three knights sat at feast in the midmost  pavilion of the three, and that a number of esquires and pages waited upon  them and served them, for those knights were of very high estate, and so  they were established as high lords should be.    [Sidenote: The three knights bid Sir Launcelot come to feast with them]  [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot overthrows Sir Gunther] Now when those knights  perceived Sir Launcelot they thought it was Sir Kay because of the armor he  wore, and Sir Gunther, who was the eldest of the three brothers, cried out:  \"Come hither, Sir Kay, and eat with us!\" But to this Sir Launcelot made no  reply, but rode on his way. Then said Sir Gunther: \"Meseems Sir Kay hath  grown very proud this morning. Now I will go and bring him back with me, or  else I will bring down his pride to earth.\" So he made haste and donned his  helmet and ran and took his shield and his spear, and mounted his horse and  rode after Sir Launcelot at a hard gallop. As he drew nigh to Sir Launcelot  he cried out: \"Stay, Sir Knight! Turn again, and go with me!\" \"Why should I  go with you?\" said Sir Launcelot. Quoth Sir Gunther: \"Because you must  either return with me or do battle with me.\" \"Well,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I  would rather do battle than return against my will.\" And at that Sir  Gunther was astonished, for Sir Kay was not wont to be so ready for a  battle. So Sir Launcelot set his shield and spear and took his stand, and  Sir Gunther took his stand. Then, when they were in all ways prepared, each  set spur to his horse and rushed together with terrible speed. So each  knight struck the other in the midst of his shield, but the onset of Sir  Launcelot was so terrible that it was not to be withstood, wherefore both  Sir Gunther and his horse were overthrown in such a cloud of dust that  nothing at all was to be seen of them until that cloud lifted.    At this both Sir Raynold and Sir Gylmere were astonished beyond measure,  for Sir Gunther was reckoned to be a much better knight than Sir Kay,  wherefore they wist not how it was that Sir Kay should have overthrown him  in that fashion.    So straightway Sir Gylmere, who was the second of those brothers, called  out to Sir Launcelot to tarry and do battle. \"Very well,\" said Sir  Launcelot, \"if I cannot escape thee I must needs do battle. Only make  haste, for I would fain be going upon my way.\"    So Sir Gylmere donned his helm in haste and ran and took his shield and  spear and mounted upon his horse. So when he had made himself ready in all  ways he rushed upon Sir Launcelot with all his might and Sir Launcelot  rushed against him.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot overthrows Sir Gylmere] In that encounter each  knight struck the other in the midst of his shield, and the spear of Sir  Gylmere burst into pieces, but Sir Launcelot's spear held, so the  breast-strap of Sir Gylmere's saddle bursting, both saddle and knight were  swept entirely off the horse and to the earth, where Sir Gylmere lay  altogether stunned.
