Above  all things, let the notes which have already been played be laid aside  for a long time; for a mistaken style of playing these has become so  confirmed that to improve them is hopeless, and the tottering edifice  must fall to the ground. First, improve the touch; help to acquire a  better and more connected scale; teach the formation of different  cadences on the dominant and sub-dominant; and the construction of  various passages on the chord of the diminished seventh, to be played  with correct, even, and quiet fingering, _legato_ and _staccato_,  _piano_, and _forte_; pay strict attention to the use of loose fingers  and a loose wrist; and allow no inattentive playing. You may soon take  up, with these studies, some entirely unfamiliar piece of music, suited  to the capacity of the pupil. It is not possible or desirable to attempt  to make a sudden and thorough change with such pupils, even if they  should show the best intentions and docility. You should select a light,  easy piece of salon music, but of a nature well adapted to the piano,  which shall not be wearisome to the pupil, and in the improved  performance of which he will take pleasure. But, if you still find that  he falls into the old, faulty manner of playing, and that the recently  acquired technique, which has not yet become habitual, is endangered by  it, lay this too aside, and take instead some appropriate etude, or  perhaps a little prelude by Bach. If, in the place of these, you choose  for instruction a ponderous sonata, in which the music would distract  the attention of the pupil from the improved technique, you give up the  most important aim of your instruction, and occupy yourself with  secondary matters; you will censure and instruct in vain, and will never  attain success. You must consider, reflect, and give your mind to the  peculiar needs of the pupil, and you must teach in accordance with the  laws of psychology. You will succeed after a while, but precipitation,  compulsion, and disputes are useless. The improvement of a soprano  voice, ruined by over-screaming, requires prudence, patience, calmness,  and modesty, and a character of a high type generally. It is also a very  thankless task, and success is rare; while on the piano a fair result  may always be accomplished.           *       *       *       *       *    I return once more to the subject so frequently discussed, that I may  try to relieve the universal difficulty of our lady pianists. I have  heard much playing of late, in parties both small and large, on  well-tuned and on ill-tuned pianos, on those with which the performer  was familiar, and on those to which she was unaccustomed; from the timid  and the self-possessed; from ladies of various ages, possessed of more  or of less talent, and in various cities: the result was always the  same.    We hear from the ladies that they could play their pieces at home before  their parents or their teachers; but this is never sufficient to enable  them to save their hearers from weariness, anxiety, and all sorts of  embarrassment. My honored ladies, you play over and over again two  mazourkas, two waltzes, two nocturnes, and the Funeral March of Chopin,  the Mazourka and other pieces by Schulhoff, the Trill-Etude, and the  Tremolo by Carl Meyer, &c.: \"it makes no difference to you which.\" You  might be able to master these pieces pretty well, but, instead of this,  you yourselves are mastered. You become embarrassed, and your hearers  still more so: the affair ends with apologies on both sides, with  equivocal compliments, with encouragement to continue in the same  course, with acknowledgment of fine hands for the piano, with uneasy,  forced congratulations to the parents and teacher; but it is always a  happy moment when the fatal soiree is over. The next day I am forced to  sigh again over the same, miserable, poorly and tediously performed  Funeral March of Chopin, and over the timorous B major Mazourka by  Schulhoff. The left hand is always left in the lurch in the difficult,  skipping basses of this piece, and in others of the present style, which  are rich in harmony and modulations. The bass part in this piece is apt  to suffer from timid and false tones; frequently the fundamental tone is  omitted, or the little finger remains resting upon it, instead of giving  the eighth note with a crisp, elastic, and sprightly touch, and the  chords are tame and incomplete. You do not give them their full value;  you leave them too quickly, because you are afraid of not striking the  next low note quickly enough; but, on the other hand, you do not strike  it at all, and one missing tone brings another one after it. The right  hand, being the most skilful, is supposed to play with expression, and  really does so; but this only makes the performance the worse. The  fundamental tone is wanting, and you are led to make a mistake in the  skip, and strike the wrong key. Finally, the whole thing is ended in  terror. I have an uneasy night; I dream of your fine hands, but the  false and the weak notes start up between like strange spectres or will  o' the wisps, and I wake with the headache, instead of with pleasant  memories.    Allow me to give you a piece of advice. Play and practise the bass part  a great deal and very often, first slowly, then quicker, during one or  two weeks, before playing the right hand with it, in order that you may  give your whole attention to playing the bass correctly, delicately, and  surely. Even when you can get through the mazourka tolerably well, you  must not think, on that account, that you will be able to play it in  company, under trying circumstances. You ought to be able to play the  piece by yourself with ease, very frequently, perfectly, and distinctly,  and in very rapid _tempo_, before you trust yourself to perform it even  slowly in company. At least, practise the more difficult passages for  the right hand very frequently, particularly the difficult and bold  conclusion, that it may not strike the hearer as rough, weak, tame, or  hurried. It is an old rule, \"If you begin well and end well, all is  well.\" You ought to practise the skipping bass over and over again by  itself, otherwise it will not go. An incorrect or deficient bass,  without depth of tone and without accentuation, ruins every thing, even  the good temper of the hearer. One thing more: you know very well  Chopin's Nocturne in E flat, and have played it, among other things, for  the last four weeks. Suddenly you are called upon to play in company.  You choose this Nocturne because you have played it nearly every day for  four weeks. But alas! the piano fiends have come to confuse you! You  strike a false bass note, and at the modulation the weak little finger  touches too feebly: bah! the fundamental tone is wanting. You are  frightened, and grow still more so; your musical aunt is frightened  also; the blood rushes to your teacher's face, and I mutter to myself,  \"_C'est toujours la meme._\" The present style of skipping basses  requires a great deal of practice and perfect security; it is necessary  for you to know the piece by heart, in order to give your whole  attention to the left hand. It is also essential that you shall have  acquired a clear, sound touch; otherwise, you cannot give a delicate  accent and shading. You must never allow yourself, _without previous  preparation_, to play those pieces of music in company, in which an  elegant mode of execution is all-important; otherwise, you will be taken  by surprise by unexpected difficulties. You must always pay special  attention to the fundamental tones, even if there should be  imperfections elsewhere. Where one fault is less important than another,  of two evils choose the least. You have been playing now for six or  eight years: are you repaid for the trouble, if it only enables you to  prepare embarrassments for others? You are not willing to play easy,  insignificant pieces; and such pieces as you choose require industry,  earnestness, and perseverance.           *       *       *       *       *    Young ladies, it is easy to discover the character of a person from his  manner of standing, walking, moving, and speaking, from the way he bows,  puts on and takes off his hat, or the arrangements of the household; and  we seldom are in error about it. It is also possible to infer beforehand  how you will play and what sort of a performance you will give, from the  manner in which you take your seat at the piano. You sidle up to the  piano lazily, bent over in a constrained manner; in your embarrassment,  you place yourself before the one-lined or two-lined _c_, instead of  before _f_; you sit unsteadily, either too high or too low, only half on  the seat, leaning either too much to the right or to the left; in a  word, as if you did not belong to the fatal music-stool. Your manner  awakens no confidence, and in this way announces that you have none  yourself. How do you expect to exercise control over a grand seven  octave piano, if you do not sit exactly in the middle, with the body  erect and the feet on the two pedals? You are not willing to look the  friend straight in the face, with whom you are to carry on a friendly,  confidential discourse! Even if your attitude and bearing were not so  injurious and dangerous for the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#20)"],[1,"in rags.    [Illustration: ISLAND ON THE COAST.]    They were bent on revenge, and terrible it was, beginning with the  consul, Caius Octavius, who had disdained to flee, and whose head was  severed from his body and displayed in the Forum, with many other  senators of the noblest blood in Rome, who had offended either Marius or  Cinna or any of their fierce followers. Marius walked along in gloomy  silence, answering no one; but his followers were bidden to spare only  those to whom he gave his hand to be kissed. The slaves pillaged the  houses, murdered many on their own account, and everything was in the  wildest uproar, till the two chiefs called in Sertorius with a legion to  restore order.    Then they named themselves consuls, without even asking for an election,  and thus Marius was seven times consul. He wanted to go out to the East  and take the command from Sulla, but his health was too much broken, and  before the year of his consulate was over he died. The last time he had  left the house, he had said to some friends that no man ought to trust  again to such a doubtful fortune as his had been; and then he took to  his bed for seven days without any known illness, and there was found  dead, so that he was thought to have starved himself to death.    Cinna put in another consul named Valerius Flaccus, and invited all the  Italians to enroll themselves as Roman citizens. Then Flaccus went out  to the East, meaning to take away the command from Sulla, who was  hunting Mithridates out of Greece, which he had seized and held for a  short time. But Flaccus' own army rose against him and killed him, and  Sulla, after beating Mithridates, driving him back to Pontus, and making  peace with him, was now to come home.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XXV.    SULLA'S PROSCRIPTION.    88-71.      There was great fear at Rome, among the friends of Cinna and Marius, at  the prospect of Sulla's return. A fire broke out in the Capitol, and  this added to their terror, for the Books of the Sybil were burnt, and  all her prophecies were lost. Cinna tried to oppose Sulla's landing, but  was killed by his own soldiers at Brundusium.    Sulla, with his victorious army, could not be stopped. Sertorius fled to  Spain, but Marius' son tried, with the help of the Samnites, to resist,  and held out Praeneste, but the Samnites were beaten in a terrible battle  outside the walls, and when the people of the city saw the heads of the  leaders carried on spear points, they insisted on giving up. Young  Marius and a Samnite noble hid themselves in a cave, and as they had no  hope, resolved to die; so they fought, hoping to kill each other, and  when Marius was left alive, he caused himself to be slain by a slave.    Sulla marched on towards Rome, furious at the resistance he met with,  and determined on a terrible vengeance. He could not enter the city till  he was ready to dismiss his army and have his triumph, so the Senate  came out to meet him in the temple of Bellona. As they took their seats,  they heard dreadful shrieks and cries. \"No matter,\" said Sulla; \"it is  only some wretches being punished.\" The wretches were the 8000 Samnite  prisoners he had taken at the battle of Praeneste, and brought to be  killed in the Campus Martius; and with these shocking sounds to mark  that he was in earnest, the purple-faced general told the trembling  Senate that if they submitted to him he would be good to them, but that  he would spare none of his enemies, great or small.    And his men were already in the city and country, slaughtering not only  the party of Marius, but every one against whom any one of them had a  spite, or whose property he coveted. Marius' body, which had been buried  and not burnt, was taken from the grave and thrown into the Tiber; and  such horrible deeds were done that Sulla was asked in the Senate where  the execution was to stop. He showed a list of eighty more who had yet  to die; and the next day and the next he brought other lists of two  hundred and thirty each. These dreadful lists were called proscriptions,  and any one who tried to shelter the victims was treated in the same  manner. The property of all who were slain was seized, and their  children declared incapable of holding any public office.    Among those who were in danger was the nephew of Marius' wife, Caius  Julius Caesar, but, as he was of a high patrician family, Sulla only  required of him to divorce his wife and marry a stepdaughter of his own.  Caesar refused, and fled to the Sabine hills, where pursuers were sent  after him; but his life was begged for by his friends at Rome,  especially by the Vestal Virgins, and Sulla spared his life, saying,  however, \"Beware; in that young trifler is more than one Marius.\" Caesar  went to join the army in the East for safety, and thus broke off the  idle life of pleasure he had been leading in Rome.    [Illustration: PALAZZO VECCHIO, FLORENCE.]    The country people were even more cruelly punished than the citizens:  whole cities were destroyed and districts laid waste; the whole of  Etruria was ravaged, the old race entirely swept away, and the towns  ruined beyond revival, while the new city of Florence was built with  their remains, and all we know of them is from the tombs which have of  late years been opened.    [Illustration: CORNELIUS SULLA.]    Both the consuls had perished, and Sulla caused himself to be named  Dictator. He had really a purpose in all the horrors he had perpetrated,  namely, to clear the way for restoring the old government at Rome, which  Marius and his Italians had been overthrowing. He did not see that the  rule which had worked tolerably well while Rome was only a little city  with a small country round it, would not serve when it was the head of  numerous distant countries, where the governors, like himself and  Marius, grew rich, and trained armies under them able to overpower the  whole state at home. So he set to work to put matters as much as  possible in the old order. So many of the Senate had been killed, that  he had to make up the numbers by putting in three hundred knights; and,  to supply the lack of other citizens, after the hosts who had perished,  he allowed the Italians to go on coming in to be enrolled as citizens;  and ten thousand slaves, who had belonged to his victims, were not only  set free, but made citizens as his own clients, thus taking the name of  Cornelius. He also much lessened the power of the tribunes of the  people, and made a law that when a man had once been a tribune he should  never be chosen for any of the higher offices of the state. By these  means he sought to keep up the old patrician power, on which he believed  the greatness of Rome depended; though, after all, the grand old  patrician families had mostly died off, and half the Senate were only  knights made noble.    After this Sulla resigned the dictatorship, for he was growing old, and  had worn out his health by his riot and luxury. He spent his time in a  villa near Rome, talking philosophy with his friends, and dictating the  history of his own life in Greek. When he died, he bade them burn his  body, contrary to the practice of the Cornelii, no doubt fearing it  would be treated like that of Marius.    The most promising of the men of his party who were growing up and  coming forward was Cnaeus Pompeius, a brave and worthy man, who had while  quite young, gained such a victory over a Numidian prince that Sulla  himself gave him the title of Magnus, or the Great. He was afterwards  sent to Spain, where Sertorius held out for eight years against the  Roman power with the help of the native chiefs, but at last was put to  death by his own followers. Things were altogether in a bad state. There  were great struggles in Rome at every election, for the officers of the  state were now chiefly esteemed for the sake of the three or five years'  government in the provinces to which they led. No expense was thought  too great in shows of beasts and gladiators by which to win the votes of  the people; for, after the year of office, the candidate meant amply to  repay himself by what he could squeeze out of the unhappy province under  his charge, and nobody cared for cruelty or injustice to any one but a  Roman citizen.    Numbers of gladiators were kept and trained to fight in these shows; and  while the Spanish war was going on, a whole school of them--seventy-eight  in number--who were kept at Capua, broke out, armed themselves with the  spits, hooks, and axes in a butcher's shop, and took refuge in the crater  of Mount Vesuvius, which at that time showed no signs of being an active  volcano. There, under their leader Spartacus, they gathered together every  gladiator slave or who could run away to them, and Spartacus wanted them  to march northward, force their way through Italy, climb the Alps, and  reach their homes in Thrace and Gaul; but the plunder of Italy tempted  them, and they would not go, till an army was sent against them under  Marcus Licinius Crassus--called Dives, or the Rich, from the spoil he had  gained during the proscription. Then Spartacus hoped to escape in a fleet  of pirate ships from Cilicia, and to hold out in the passes of Mount  Taurus; but the Cilician pirates deceived him, sailed away with his money,  and left him to his fate, and he and his gladiators were all slain by  Crassus and Pompeius, who had been called home from Spain.          CHAPTER XXVI.    THE CAREER OF POMPEIUS.    70-63.      Cnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Lucius Licinius Crassus Dives were consuls  together in the year 70; but Crassus, though he feasted the people at  10,000 tables, was envied and disliked, and would never have been  elected but for Pompeius, who was a great favorite with the people, and  so much trusted, both by them and the nobles, that it seems to have  filled him with pride, for he gave himself great airs, and did not treat  his fellow-consul as"]]]
