But my ma said he didn't allow a patroller on the place and he  didn't allow no other white man to touch his niggers. He was a big white  man--a senator. He didn't know all his Negroes but he didn't allow  nobody to impose on them. He didn't let no patroller and nobody else  beat up his niggers.      How Freedom Came    \"I don't know how freedom came. I know the Yankees came through and  they'd pat we little niggers on the head and say, 'Nigger, you are just  as free as I am.' And I would say, 'Yes'm.'      Right After Freedom    \"Right after the War my mother and father moved off the place and went  on another plantation somewheres--I don't know where. They share  cropped. I don't know how long. Old mistress didn't want them to move at  all. I never will forget that.      Present Occupation and Opinions    \"I used to cook out all the time when I got grown. I couldn't tell you  when I married. You got enough junk down there now. So I ain't giving  you no more. My husband's been dead about seven years. I goes to the  Methodist church on Ninth and Broadway. I ain't able to do no work now.  I gets a little pension, and the Lord takes care of me. I have a hard  time sometime.    \"I ain't bothered about these young folks. They is _somethin' awful_. It  would be wonderful to write a book from that. They ought to git a  history of these young people. You could git a wonderful book out of  that.    \"The colored folks have come a long way since freedom. And if the white  folks didn't pin 'em down they'd go further. Old Jeff Davis said when  the niggers was turned loose, 'Dive up your knives and forks with them.'  But they didn't do it.    \"Some niggers was sharp and got something. And they lost it just like  they got it. Look at Bush. I know two or three big niggers got a lot and  ain't got nothin' left now. Well, I ain't got no time for no more junk.  You got enough down there. You take that and go on.\"      Interviewer's Comment    During the interview, a little \"pickaninny\" came in with his mother. His  grandmother and a forlorn little dog were also along. \"Tell grandma what  you want,\" his mother prompted. \"Is that your grandson?\" I interrupted.  \"No,\" she said, \"He ain't no kin to me, but he calls me 'ma' and acts as  if I was his grandma.\" The little fellow hung back. He was just about  twenty-two months old, but large and mature for that age.    \"Tell 'ma' what you want,\" his grandmother put in. Finally, he made up  his mind and stood in front of her and said, \"Buh--er.\" His mother  explained, \"I've done made him some corn bread, but he ain't got no  butter to put on it and he wants you to give him some.\"    Sister Morgan sat silent awhile. Then she rose deliberately and went  slowly to the ancient ice-box, opened it and took out a tin of butter  which she had evidently churned herself in some manner and carefully cut  out a small piece and wrapped it neatly and handed it to the little one.  After a few amenities, they passed out.    Even with her pitiful and meagre lot, the old lady evidently means to  share her bare necessities with others.    The manner of her calculation of her age is interesting. She was six  years old when the War was going on. She definitely remembers seeing  Sherman's army and Wheeler's cavalry after she was six. Since they were  in her neighborhood in 1864, she is undoubtedly more than eighty.  Eighty-one is a fair estimate.          Interviewer: Samuel S. Taylor  Person interviewed: James Morgan                      819 Rice Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 65      \"During the slave time, the pateroles used to go from one plantation to  the other hunting Negroes. They would catch them at the door and throw  hot ashes in their faces. You could go to another plantation and steal  or do anything you wanted if you could manage to get back to your old  master's place. But if you got caught away from your plantation, they  would get you. Sometimes a nigger didn't want to get caught and beat, so  he would throw a shovel of hot ashes in the pateroles' faces and beat it  away.    \"My daddy used to tell lots of stories about slavery times. He's been  dead forty-three years and my mother has been dead forty-one  years--forty-one years this May. I was quite young and lots of the  things they told me, I remember, and some of them, I don't.    \"I was born in 1873. That was eight years after the War ended. My  father's name was Aaron and my mother's name was Rosa. Both of them was  in slavery.[TR: sentence lined out.] I got a brother that was a baby in  her lap when the Yankee soldiers got after a chicken. The chicken flew  up in her lap and they never got that one. The white folks lost it, but  the Yankees didn't get it. I have heard my mother tell all sorts of  things. But they just come to me at times. The soldiers would take  chickens or anything they could get their hands on--those soldiers  would.    \"My mother married the first time in slavery. Her first husband was sold  in slavery. That is the onliest brother I'm got living now out of  ten--that one that was settin' in her lap when the soldiers come  through. He's in Boydell, Arkansas now. It used to be called Morrell. It  is about one hundred twenty-one miles from here, because Dermott is one  hundred nine and Boydell is about twelve miles further on. It's in  Nashville[HW:?] County. My brother was a great big old baby in slavery  times. He was my mother's child by her first husband. All the rest of  them is dead and he is the onliest one that is living.    \"I was a section foreman for the Missouri Pacific for twenty-two years.  I worked there altogether for thirty-five years, but I was section  foreman for twenty-two years. There's my card. Lots of men stayed on the  job till it wore them out. Lewis Holmes did that. It would take him two  hours to walk from here to his home--if he ever managed it at all.    \"It's warm today and it will bring a lot of flies. Flies don't die in  the winter. Lots of folks think they do. They go up in cracks and little  places like that under the weatherboard there--any place where it is  warm--and there they huddle up and stay till it gets warm. Then they  come out and get something to eat and go back again when it cools off.  They live right on through the winter in their hiding places.    \"Both of my parents said they always did their work whatever the task  might be. And my daddy said he never got no whipping at all. You know  they would put a task on you and if you didn't do it, you would get a  whipping. My daddy wouldn't stand to be whipped by a paterole, and he  didn't have to be whipped by nobody else, because he always did his  work.    \"He was one of the ones that the pateroles couldn't catch. When the  pateroles would be trying to break in some place where he was, and the  other niggers would be standing 'round frightened to death and wonderin'  what to do, he would be gettin' up a shovelful of ashes. When the door  would be opened and they would be rushin' in, he would scatter the ashes  in their faces and rush out. If he couldn't find no ashes, he would  always have a handful of pepper with him, and he would throw that in  their faces and beat it.    \"He would fool dogs that my too. My daddy never did run away. He said he  didn't have no need to run away. They treated him all right. He did his  work. He would get through with everything and sometimes he would be  home before six o'clock. My mother said that lots of times she would  pick cotton and give it to the others that couldn't keep up so that they  wouldn't be punished. She had a brother they used to whip all the time  because he didn't keep up.    \"My father told me that his old master told him he was free. He stayed  with his master till he retired and sold the place. He worked on shares  with him. His old master sold the place and went to Monticello and died.  He stayed with him about fifteen or sixteen years after he was freed,  stayed on that place till the Government donated him one hundred sixty  acres and charged him only a dollar and sixty cents for it. He built a  house on it and cleared it up. That's what my daddy did. Some folks  don't believe me when I tell 'em the Government gave him a hundred and  sixty acres of land and charged him only a dollar and sixty cents for  it--a penny a acre.    \"I am retired now. Been retired since 1938. The Government took over the  railroad pension and it pays me now. That is under the Security Act.  Each and every man on the railroad pays in to the Government.    \"I have been married right around thirty-nine years.    \"I was born in Chicot County, Arkansas.[TR: sentence lined out.] My  father was born in Georgia and brought here by his master. He come here  in a old covered ox wagon. I don't know how they happened to decide to  come here. My mother was born in South Carolina. She met my father here  in Arkansas. They sold her husband and she was brought here. After peace  was declared she met my daddy. Her first husband was sold in South  Carolina and she never did know that became of him. They put him up on  the block and sold him and she never did know which way he went. He left  her with two boys right then. She had a sister that stayed in South  Carolina. Somebody bought her there and kept her and somebody bought my  mother and brought her here. My father's master was named McDermott. My  mother's last master was named Belcher or something like that.    \"I don't belong to any church. I have always lived decent and kept out  of trouble.\"      Interviewer's Comment    When Morgan said \"there is my record\", he showed me a pass for the year  1938-39 for himself and his wife between all stations on the Missouri  Pacific lines signed by L.W.

So the people were hungry, and began to starve.    One morning, early, a young woman went to get water, and she saw a herd of  buffalo feeding on the prairie, right on the edge of the cliff above the  pis'kun. \"Oh!\" she cried out, \"if you will only jump off into the pis'kun,  I will marry one of you.\" This she said for fun, not meaning it, and great  was her wonder when she saw the buffalo come jumping, tumbling, falling  over the cliff.    Now the young woman was scared, for a big bull with one bound cleared the  pis'kun walls and came toward her. \"Come,\" he said, taking hold of her  arm. \"No, no!\" she replied pulling back. \"But you said if the buffalo would  jump over, you would marry one; see, the pis'kun is filled.\" And without  more talk he led her up over the bluff, and out on to the prairie.    When the people had finished killing the buffalo and cutting up the meat,  they missed this young woman, and her relations were very sad, because they  could not find her. Then her father took his bow and quiver, and said, \"I  will go and find her.\" And he went up over the bluff and out on the  prairie.    After he had travelled some distance he came to a wallow, and a little way  off saw a herd of buffalo. While sitting by the wallow,--for he was  tired--and thinking what he should do, a magpie came and lit near him. \"Ha!  _Ma-me-at-si-kim-i\"_ he said, \"you are a beautiful bird; help me. Look  everywhere as you travel about, and if you see my daughter, tell her, 'Your  father waits by the wallow.'\" The magpie flew over by the herd of buffalo,  and seeing the young woman, he lit on the ground near her, and commenced  picking around, turning his head this way and that way, and, when close to  her, he said, \"Your father waits by the wallow.\" \"Sh-h-h! sh-h-h!\" replied  the girl, in a whisper, looking around scared, for her bull husband was  sleeping near by. \"Don't speak so loud. Go back and tell him to wait.\"    \"Your daughter is over there with the buffalo. She says 'wait!'\" said the  magpie, when he had flown back to the man.    By and by the bull awoke, and said to his wife, \"Go and get me some water.\"  Then the woman was glad, and taking a horn from his head she went to the  wallow. \"Oh, why did you come?\" she said to her father. \"You will surely be  killed.\"    \"I came to take my daughter home; come, let us hurry.\"    \"No, no!\" she replied; \"not now. They would chase us and kill us. Wait till  he sleeps again, and I will try to get away,\" and, filling the horn with  water, she went back.    The bull drank a swallow of the water. \"Ha!\" said he, \"a person is close by  here.\"    \"No one,\" replied the woman; but her heart rose up.    The bull drank a little more, and then he stood up and bellowed, \"_Bu-u-u!  m-m-ah-oo!\"_ Oh, fearful sound! Up rose the bulls, raised their short tails  and shook them, tossed their great heads, and bellowed back. Then they  pawed the dirt, rushed about here and there, and coming to the wallow,  found that poor man. There they trampled him with their great hoofs, hooked  him and trampled him again, and soon not even a small piece of his body  could be seen.    Then his daughter cried, \"_Oh! ah! Ni-nah-ah! Oh! ah! Ni-nah-ah!_\" (My  father! My father!) \"Ah!\" said her bull husband, \"you mourn for your  father. You see now how it is with us. We have seen our mothers, fathers,  many of our relations, hurled over the rocky walls, and killed for food by  your people. But I will pity you. I will give you one chance. If you can  bring your father to life, you and he can go back to your people.\"    Then the woman said to the magpie: \"Pity me. Help me now; go and seek in  the trampled mud; try and find a little piece of my father's body, and  bring it to me.\"    The magpie flew to the place. He looked in every hole, and tore up the mud  with his sharp nose. At last he found something white; he picked the mud  from around it, and then pulling hard, he brought out a joint of the  backbone, and flew with it back to the woman.    She placed it on the ground, covered it with her robe, and then  sang. Removing the robe, there lay her father's body as if just dead. Once  more she covered it with the robe and sang, and when she took away the  robe, he was breathing, and then he stood up. The buffalo were surprised;  the magpie was glad, and flew round and round, making a great noise.    \"We have seen strange things this day,\" said her bull husband. \"He whom we  trampled to death, even into small pieces, is alive again. The people's  medicine is very strong. Now, before you go, we will teach you our dance  and our song. You must not forget them.\"[1] When the dance was over, the  bull said: \"Go now to your home, and do not forget what you have  seen. Teach it to the people. The medicine shall be a bull's head and a  robe. All the persons who are to be 'Bulls' shall wear them when they  dance.\"    [Footnote 1: Here the narrator repeated the song and showed the dance. As  is fitting to the dance of such great beasts, the air is slow and solemn,  and the step ponderous and deliberate.]    Great was the joy of the people, when the man returned with his  daughter. He called a council of the chiefs, and told them all that had  happened. Then the chiefs chose certain young men, and this man taught them  the dance and song of the bulls, and told them what the medicine should  be. This was the beginning of the _I-kun-uh'-kah-tsi_.          II    THE OTHER BANDS      For a long time the buffalo had not been seen. The pis'kun was useless, and  the hunters could find no food for the people. Then a man who had two  wives, a daughter, and two sons, said: \"I shall not stop here to  die. To-morrow we will move toward the mountains, where we shall perhaps  find deer and elk, sheep and antelope, or, if not, at least we shall find  plenty of beaver and birds. Thus we shall survive.\"    When morning came, they packed the travois, lashed them on the dogs, and  then moved out. It was yet winter, and they travelled slowly. They were  weak, and could go but a little way in a day. The fourth night came, and  they sat in their lodge, very tired and hungry. No one spoke, for those who  are hungry do not care for words. Suddenly the dogs began to bark, and  soon, pushing aside the door-curtain, a young man entered.    \"_O'kyi!_\" said the old man, and he motioned the stranger to a  sitting-place.    They looked at this person with surprise and fear, for there was a black  wind[1] which had melted the snow, and covered the prairie with water, yet  this person's leggings and moccasins were dry. They sat in silence a long  time.    [Footnote 1: The \"Chinook.\"]    Then said he: \"Why is this? Why do you not give me some food?\"    \"Ah!\" replied the old man, \"you behold those who are truly poor. We have no  food. For many days the buffalo did not come in sight, and we shot deer and  other animals which people eat, and when all these had been killed, we  began to starve. Then said I, 'We will not stay here to starve to death';  and we started for the mountains. This is the fourth night of our travels.\"    \"Ah!\" said the young man. \"Then your travels are ended. Close by here, we  are camped by our pis'kun. Many buffalo have been run in, and our  parfleches are filled with dried meat. Wait; I will go and bring you some.\"    As soon as he went out, they began to talk about this strange person. They  were very much afraid of him, and did not know what to do. The children  began to cry, and the women were trying to quiet them, when the young man  returned, bringing some meat and three _pis-tsi-ko'-an._[2]    [Footnote 2: Unborn buffalo calves.]    \"_Kyi!_\" said he. \"To-morrow move over to our lodges. Do not be afraid. No  matter what strange things you see, do not fear. All will be your  friends. Now, one thing I caution you about. In this be careful. If you  should find an arrow lying about, in the pis'kun, or outside, no matter  where, do not touch it; neither you, nor your wives nor children.\" Having  said this, he went out.    Then the old man took his pipe and smoked and prayed, saying: \"Hear now,  Sun! Listen, Above People. Listen, Under Water People. Now you have taken  pity. Now you have given us food. We are going to those strange ones, who  walk through water with dry moccasins. Protect us among those to-be-feared  people. Let us survive. Man, woman, child, give us long life; give us long  life!\"    Once more the smell of roasting meat. The children played. They talked and  laughed who had so long been silent. They ate plenty and lay down and  slept.    Early in the morning, as soon as the sun rose, they took down their lodge,  packed up, and started for the strange camp. They found it was a wonderful  place. There by the pis'kun, and far up and down the valley were the lodges  of meat-eaters. They could not see them all, but close by they saw the  lodges of the Bear band, the Fox band, and the Badger band. The father of  the young man who had given them meat was chief of the Wolf band, and by  that band they pitched their lodge. Ah! That was a happy place. Food there  was plenty. All day people shouted out for feasts, and everywhere was heard  the sound of drums and song and dancing.    The new-comers went to the pis'kun for meat, and one of the children found  an arrow lying on the ground. It was a beautiful arrow, the stone point  long and sharp, the shaft round and straight. All around the people were  busy; no one was looking. The boy picked up the arrow and hid it under his  robe. Then there was a fearful noise. All the animals howled and growled,  and ran toward him. But the chief Wolf said: \"Hold! We will let him go this  time; for he is young yet, and not of good sense.\" So they let him go.    When night came, some one shouted out for a feast, saying:  \"_Wo'-ka-hit! Wo'-ka-hit! Mah-kwe'-i-ke-tum-ok-ah-wah-hit."]]]
