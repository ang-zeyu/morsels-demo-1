Her ears are trained beyond anybody's else; love's  training. We need trained ears. A quiet place shuts out the outer sounds,  and gives the inner ear a chance to learn other sounds.    A man was standing in a telephone booth trying to talk, but could not make  out the message. He kept saying, \"I can't hear, I can't hear.\" The other  man by and by said sharply, \"If you'll shut that door you can hear.\" _His_  door was shut and he could hear not only the man's voice but the street  and store noises too. Some folks have gotten their hearing badly confused  because their doors have not been shut enough. Man's voice and God's voice  get mixed in their ears. They cannot tell between them. The bother is  partly with the door. If you'll shut that door you can hear.    The third suggestion needs much emphasis to-day: _give the Book of God its  place in prayer._ Prayer is not talking to God--simply. It is listening  first, then talking. Prayer needs three organs of the head, an ear, a  tongue and an eye. First an ear to hear what God says, then a tongue to  speak, then an eye to look out for the result. Bible study is the  listening side of prayer. The purpose of God comes in through the ear,  passes through the heart taking on the tinge of your personality, and goes  out at the tongue as prayer. It is pathetic what a time God has getting a  hearing down here. He is ever speaking but even where there may be some  inclination to hear the sounds of earth are choking in our ears the sound  of His voice. God speaks in His Word. The most we know of God comes to us  here. This Book is God in print. It was inspired, and it _is_ inspired.  God Himself speaks in this Book. That puts it in a list by itself, quite  apart from all others. Studying it keenly, intelligently, reverently will  reveal God's great will. What He says will utterly change what you will  say.        <u>Our Prayer Teacher.</u>      The fourth suggestion is this: _Let the Spirit teach you how to pray_. The  more you pray the more you will find yourself saying to yourself, \"I don't  know how to pray.\" Well God understands that. Paul knew that out of his  own experience before he wrote it down. And God has a plan to cover our  need there. There is One who is a master intercessor. He understands  praying perfectly. He is the Spirit of prayer. God has sent Him down to  live inside you and me, partly for this, to teach us the fine art of  prayer. The suggestion is this: let Him teach you.    When you go alone in the quiet time and place with the Book quietly pray:  \"blessed Prayer-Spirit, Master-Spirit, teach me how to pray,\" and He will.  Do not be nervous, or agitated, wondering if you will understand. Study to  be quiet; mind quiet, body quiet. Be still and listen. Remember Luther's  version of David's words,[31] \"Be silent to God, and let Him mould thee.\"    You will find your praying changing. You will talk more simply, like a man  transacting business or a child asking, though of course with a reverence  and a deepness of feeling not in those things. You will quit asking for  some things. Some of the old forms of prayer will drop from your lips  likely enough. You will use fewer words, maybe, but they will be spoken  with a quiet absolute faith that this thing you are asking is being worked  out.    This thing of _letting the Spirit teach_ must come first in one's praying,  and remain to the last, and continue all along as the leading dominant  factor. He is a Spirit of prayer peculiarly. The highest law of the  Christian life is obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit. There needs  to be a cultivated judgment in reading His leading, and not mistaking our  haphazard thoughts as His voice. He should be allowed to teach us how to  pray and more, to dominate our praying. The whole range and intensity of  the spirit conflict is under His eye. He is God's General on the field of  action. There come crises in the battle when the turn of the tide wavers.  He knows when a bit of special praying is needed to turn the tide and  bring victory. So there needs to be special seasons of persistent prayer,  a continuing until victory is assured. Obey His promptings. Sometimes  there comes an impulse to pray, or to ask another to pray. And we think,  \"Why, I have just been praying,\" _or_, \"he does pray about this anyway. It  is not necessary to pray again. I do not just like to suggest it.\" Better  obey the impulse quietly, with fewest words of explanation to the other  one concerned, or no words beyond simply the request.    Let Him, this wondrous Holy Spirit teach you how to pray. It will take  time. You may be a bit set in your way, but if you will just yield and  patiently wait, He will teach what to pray, suggest definite things, and  often the very language of prayer.    You will notice that the chief purpose of these four suggestions is to  learn God's will. The quiet place, the quiet time, the Book, the  Spirit--this is the schoolroom as Andrew Murray would finely put it. Here  we learn His will. Learning that makes one eager to have it done, and  breathes anew the longing prayer that it may be done.    There is a fine word much used in the Psalms, and in Isaiah for this sort  of thing--_waiting_. Over and over again that is the word used for that  contact with God which reveals to us His will, and imparts to us anew His  desires. It is a word full of richest and deepest meaning. Waiting is not  an occasional nor a hurried thing. It means _steadfastness_, that is  holding on; _patience_, that is holding back; _expectancy_, that is  holding the face up to see; _obedience_, that is holding one's self in  readiness to go or do; it means _listening_, that is holding quiet and  still so as to hear.        <u>The Power of a Name.</u>      The fifth suggestion has already been referred to, but should be repeated  here. Prayer must be _in Jesus' name_. The relationship of prayer is  through Jesus. And the prayer itself must be offered in His name, because  the whole strength of the case lies in Jesus. I recall distinctly a  certain section of this country where I was for awhile, and very rarely  did I hear Jesus' name used in prayer. I heard men, that I knew must be  good men, praying in church, in prayer-meeting and elsewhere with no  mention of Jesus. Let us distinctly bear in mind that we have no standing  with God except through Jesus.    If the keenest lawyer of London, who knew more of American law, and of  Illinois statute and of Chicago ordinance--suppose such a case--were to  come here, could he plead a case in your court-house? you know he could  not. He would have no legal standing here. Now you and I have no standing  at yonder bar. We are disbarred through sin. Only as we come through one  who has recognized standing there can we come.    But turn that fact around. As we do come in Jesus' name, it is the same as  though Jesus prayed. It is the same as though--let me be saying it very  softly so it may seem very reverent--as though Jesus put His arm in yours  and took you up to the Father, and said, \"Father, here is a friend of  mine; we're on good terms. Please give him anything he asks, for My sake.\"  And the Father would quickly bend over and graciously say, \"What'll you  have? You may have anything you ask when My Son asks for it.\" That is the  practical effect of asking in Jesus' name.    But I am very, very clear of this, and I keep swinging back to it that in  the ultimate analysis the force of using Jesus' name is that He is the  victor over the traitor prince. Prayer is repeating the Victor's name into  the ears of Satan and insisting upon his retreat. As one prays  persistently in Jesus' name, the evil one must go. Reluctantly, angrily,  he must loosen his clutches, and go back.        <u>The Birthplace of Faith.</u>      The sixth suggestion is a familiar one, and yet one much misunderstood.  Prayer must be _in faith_. But please note that faith here is not  believing that God _can_, but that He _will_. It is kneeling and making  the prayer, and then saying, \"Father, I thank Thee for this; that it will  be so, I thank Thee.\" Then rising and going about your duties, saying,  \"that thing is settled.\" Going again and again, and repeating the prayer  with the thanks, and then saying as you go off, \"that matter is assured.\"  Not going repeatedly to persuade God. But because prayer is the deciding  factor in a spirit conflict and each prayer is like a fresh blow between  the eyes of the enemy, a fresh broadside from your fleet upon the fort.    \"Well,\" some one will say, \"now you are getting that keyed up rather high.  Can we all have faith like that? Can a man _make_ himself believe?\" There  should be no unnatural mechanical insisting that you do believe. Some  earnest people make a mistake there. And we will not all have faith like  that. That is quite true, and I can easily tell you why. The faith that  believes that God _will_ do what you ask is not born in a hurry; it is not  born in the dust of the street, and the noise of the crowd. But I can tell  where that faith will have a birthplace and keep growing stronger: in  every heart that takes quiet time off habitually with God, and listens to  His voice in His word. Into that heart will come a simple strong faith  that the thing it is led to ask shall be accomplished.    That faith has four simple characteristics. It is _intelligent_. It finds  out what God's will is. Faith is never contrary to reason. Sometimes it is  a bit higher up; the reasoning process has not yet reached up to it.  Second, it is _obedient_. It fits its life into God's will. There is apt  to be a stiff rub here all the time. Then it is _expectant_. It looks out  for the result. It bows down upon the earth, but sends a man to keep an  eye on the sea. And then it is _persistent_. It hangs on."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co.

In all the history of the war, I cannot remember of more privations and  hardships than we went through at Missionary Ridge.  And when in the very  acme of our privations and hunger, when the army was most dissatisfied  and unhappy, we were ordered into line of battle to be reviewed by  Honorable Jefferson Davis.  When he passed by us, with his great retinue  of staff officers and play-outs at full gallop, cheers greeted them,  with the words, \"Send us something to eat, Massa Jeff.  Give us something  to eat, Massa Jeff.  I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!\"      SERGEANT TUCKER AND GENERAL WILDER    At this place the Yankee outpost was on one side of the Tennessee river,  and ours on the other.  I was on the detail one Sunday commanded by  Sergeant John T. Tucker.  When we were approaching we heard the old guard  and the Yankee picket talking back and forth across the river.  The new  guard immediately resumed the conversation.  We had to halloo at the top  of our voices, the river being about three hundred yards wide at this  point.  But there was a little island about the middle of the river.  A Yankee hallooed out, \"O, Johnny, Johnny, meet me half way in the river  on the island.\"  \"All right,\" said Sergeant Tucker, who immediately  undressed all but his hat, in which he carried the Chattanooga Rebel and  some other Southern newspapers, and swam across to the island.  When he  got there the Yankee was there, but the Yankee had waded.  I do not know  what he and John talked about, but they got very friendly, and John  invited him to come clear across to our side, which invitation he  accepted.  I noticed at the time that while John swam, the Yankee waded,  remarking that he couldn't swim.  The river was but little over waist  deep.  Well, they came across and we swapped a few lies, canteens and  tobacco, and then the Yankee went back, wading all the way across the  stream.  That man was General Wilder, commanding the Federal cavalry,  and at the battle of Missionary Ridge he threw his whole division of  cavalry across the Tennessee river at that point, thus flanking Bragg's  army, and opening the battle.  He was examining the ford, and the  swapping business was but a mere by-play.  He played it sharp, and Bragg  had to get further.      MOCCASIN POINT    Maney's brigade fortified on top of Lookout Mountain.  From this position  we could see five states.  The Yankees had built a fort across the river,  on Moccasin Point, and were throwing shells at us continually.  I have  never seen such accurate shooting in my life.  It was upon the principle  of shooting a squirrel out of a tree, and they had become so perfect in  their aim, that I believe they could have killed a squirrel a mile off.  We could have killed a great many artillery men if we had been allowed to  shoot, but no private soldier was ever allowed to shoot a gun on his own  hook.  If he shot at all, it must by the order of an officer, for if just  one cartridge was shot away or lost, the private was charged twenty-five  cents for it, and had to do extra duty, and I don't think our artillery  was ever allowed to fire a single shot under any circumstances.  Our  rations were cooked up by a special detail ten miles in the rear, and  were sent to us every three days, and then those three days' rations were  generally eaten up at one meal, and the private soldier had to starve the  other two days and a half.  Never in all my whole life do I remember of  ever experiencing so much oppression and humiliation.  The soldiers were  starved and almost naked, and covered all over with lice and camp itch  and filth and dirt.  The men looked sick, hollow-eyed, and heart-broken,  living principally upon parched corn, which had been picked out of the  mud and dirt under the feet of officers' horses.  We thought of nothing  but starvation.    The battle of Missionary Ridge was opened from Moccasin Point, while  we were on Lookout Mountain, but I knew nothing of the movements or  maneuvers of either army, and only tell what part I took in the battle.      BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE    One morning Theodore Sloan, Hog Johnson and I were standing picket at the  little stream that runs along at the foot of Lookout Mountain.  In fact,  I would be pleased to name our captain, Fulcher, and Lieutenant Lansdown,  of the guard on this occasion, because we acted as picket for the whole  three days' engagement without being relieved, and haven't been relieved  yet.  But that battle has gone into history.  We heard a Yankee call, \"O,  Johnny, Johnny Reb!\"  I started out to meet him as formerly, when he  hallooed out, \"Go back, Johnny, go back; we are ordered to fire on you.\"  \"What is the matter?  Is your army going to advance on us?\"  \"I don't  know; we are ordered to fire.\"  I jumped back into the picket post,  and a minnie ball ruined the only hat I had; another and another followed  in quick succession, and the dirt flew up in our faces off our little  breastworks.  Before night the picket line was engaged from one end to  the other.  If you had only heard it, dear reader.  It went like ten  thousand wood-choppers, and an occasional boom of a cannon would remind  you of a tree falling.  We could hear colonels giving commands to their  regiments, and could see very plainly the commotion and hubbub, but what  was up, we were unable to tell.  The picket line kept moving to our  right.  The second night found us near the tunnel, and right where two  railroads cross each other, or rather one runs over the other high enough  for the cars to pass under.  We could see all over Chattanooga, and it  looked like myriads of blue coats swarming.    Day's and Mannigault's brigades got into a night attack at the foot of  Lookout Mountain.  I could see the whole of it.  It looked like lightning  bugs on a dark night.  But about midnight everything quieted down.  Theodore Sloan, Hog Johnson and myself occupied an old log cabin as  vidette.  We had not slept any for two nights, and were very drowsy,  I assure you, but we knew there was something up, and we had to keep  awake.  The next morning, nearly day, I think I had dropped off into a  pleasant doze, and was dreaming of more pretty things than you ever saw  in your life, when Johnson touched me and whispered, \"Look, look, there  are three Yankees; must I shoot?\"  I whispered back \"Yes.\"  A bang;  \"a waugh\" went a shriek.  He had got one, sure.  Everything got quiet  again, and we heard nothing more for an hour.  Johnson touched me again  and whispered, \"Yonder they come again; look, look!\"  I could not see  them; was too sleepy for that.  Sloan could not see them, either.  Johnson pulled down, and another unearthly squall rended the night air.  The streaks of day had begun to glimmer over Missionary Ridge, and I  could see in the dim twilight the Yankee guard not fifty yards off.  Said I, \"Boys, let's fire into them and run.\"  We took deliberate aim and  fired.  At that they raised, I thought, a mighty sickly sort of yell and  charged the house.  We ran out, but waited on the outside.  We took a  second position where the railroads cross each other, but they began  shelling us from the river, when we got on the opposite side of the  railroad and they ceased.    I know nothing about the battle; how Grant, with one wing, went up the  river, and Hooker's corps went down Wills valley, etc.  I heard fighting  and commanding and musketry all day long, but I was still on picket.  Balls were passing over our heads, both coming and going.  I could not  tell whether I was standing picket for Yankees or Rebels.  I knew that  the Yankee line was between me and the Rebel line, for I could see the  battle right over the tunnel.  We had been placed on picket at the foot  of Lookout Mountain, but we were five miles from that place now.  If  I had tried to run in I couldn't.  I had got separated from Sloan and  Johnson somehow; in fact, was waiting either for an advance of the  Yankees, or to be called in by the captain of the picket.  I could see  the blue coats fairly lining Missionary Ridge in my head.  The Yankees  were swarming everywhere.  They were passing me all day with their dead  and wounded, going back to Chattanooga.  No one seemed to notice me;  they were passing to and fro, cannon, artillery, and everything.  I  was willing to be taken prisoner, but no one seemed disposed to do it.  I was afraid to look at them, and I was afraid to hide, for fear some  one's attention would be attracted toward me.  I wished I could make  myself invisible.  I think I was invisible.  I felt that way anyhow.  I felt like the boy who wanted to go to the wedding, but had no shoes.  Cassabianca never had such feelings as I had that livelong day.        Say, captain, say, if yet my task be done?        And yet the sweeping waves rolled on,      And answered neither yea nor nay.    About two or three o'clock, a column of Yankees advancing to the attack  swept right over where I was standing.  I was trying to stand aside to  get out of their way, but the more I tried to get out of their way,  the more in their way I got.  I was carried forward, I knew not whither.  We soon arrived at the foot of the ridge, at our old breastworks.  I recognized Robert Brank's old corn stalk house, and Alf Horsley's fort,  an old log house called Fort Horsley.  I was in front of the enemy's line,  and was afraid to run up the ridge, and afraid to surrender.  They were  ordered to charge up the hill.  There was no firing from the Rebel lines  in our immediate front.  They kept climbing and pulling and scratching  until I was in touching distance of the old Rebel breastworks, right on  the very apex of Missionary Ridge.  I made one jump, and I heard Captain  Turner, who had the very four Napoleon guns we had captured at Perryville,  halloo out, \"Number four, solid!\" and then a roar.  The next order was  \"Limber to the rear.\"  The Yankees were cutting"]]]
