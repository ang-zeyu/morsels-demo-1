The Cotter's Saturday Night         Inscribed to R. Aiken, Esq., of Ayr.         Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,       Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;       Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,       The short and simple annals of the Poor.       Gray.         My lov'd, my honour'd, much respected friend!       No mercenary bard his homage pays;       With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end,       My dearest meed, a friend's esteem and praise:       To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays,       The lowly train in life's sequester'd scene,       The native feelings strong, the guileless ways,       What Aiken in a cottage would have been;       Ah! tho' his worth unknown, far happier there I ween!         November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh;       The short'ning winter-day is near a close;       The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh;       The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose:       The toil-worn Cotter frae his labour goes,--       This night his weekly moil is at an end,       Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes,       Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend,       And weary, o'er the moor, his course does hameward bend.         At length his lonely cot appears in view,       Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;       Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin, stacher through       To meet their dead, wi' flichterin noise and glee.       His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,       His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile,       The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,       Does a' his weary kiaugh and care beguile,       And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil.         Belyve, the elder bairns come drapping in,       At service out, amang the farmers roun';       Some ca' the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin       A cannie errand to a neibor town:       Their eldest hope, their Jenny, woman-grown,       In youthfu' bloom-love sparkling in her e'e--       Comes hame, perhaps to shew a braw new gown,       Or deposite her sair-won penny-fee,       To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be.         With joy unfeign'd, brothers and sisters meet,       And each for other's weelfare kindly speirs:       The social hours, swift-wing'd, unnotic'd fleet:       Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears.       The parents, partial, eye their hopeful years;       Anticipation forward points the view;       The mother, wi' her needle and her shears,       Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;       The father mixes a' wi' admonition due.         Their master's and their mistress' command,       The younkers a' are warned to obey;       And mind their labours wi' an eydent hand,       And ne'er, tho' out o' sight, to jauk or play;       \"And O! be sure to fear the Lord alway,       And mind your duty, duly, morn and night;       Lest in temptation's path ye gang astray,       Implore His counsel and assisting might:       They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright.\"         But hark! a rap comes gently to the door;       Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same,       Tells how a neibor lad came o'er the moor,       To do some errands, and convoy her hame.       The wily mother sees the conscious flame       Sparkle in Jenny's e'e, and flush her cheek;       With heart-struck anxious care, enquires his name,       While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak;       Weel-pleased the mother hears, it's nae wild, worthless rake.         Wi' kindly welcome, Jenny brings him ben;       A strappin youth, he takes the mother's eye;       Blythe Jenny sees the visit's no ill ta'en;       The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye.       The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy,       But blate an' laithfu', scarce can weel behave;       The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy       What makes the youth sae bashfu' and sae grave,       Weel-pleas'd to think her bairn's respected like the lave.         O happy love! where love like this is found:       O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!       I've paced much this weary, mortal round,       And sage experience bids me this declare,--       \"If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare--       One cordial in this melancholy vale,       'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair       In other'sarms, breathe out the tender tale,       Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.\"         Is there, in human form, that bears a heart,       A wretch! a villain! lost to love and truth!       That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art,       Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?       Curse on his perjur'd arts! dissembling smooth!       Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil'd?       Is there no pity, no relenting ruth,       Points to the parents fondling o'er their child?       Then paints the ruin'd maid, and their distraction wild?         But now the supper crowns their simple board,       The halesome parritch, chief of Scotia's food;       The sowp their only hawkie does afford,       That, 'yont the hallan snugly chows her cood:       The dame brings forth, in complimental mood,       To grace the lad, her weel-hain'd kebbuck, fell;       And aft he's prest, and aft he ca's it guid:       The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell       How t'was a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell.         The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face,       They, round the ingle, form a circle wide;       The sire turns o'er, with patriarchal grace,       The big ha'bible, ance his father's pride:       His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside,       His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare;       Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide,       He wales a portion with judicious care;       And \"Let us worship God!\" he says with solemn air.         They chant their artless notes in simple guise,       They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim;       Perhaps Dundee's wild-warbling measures rise;       Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name;       Or noble Elgin beets the heaven-ward flame;       The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays:       Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;       The tickl'd ears no heart-felt raptures raise;       Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.         The priest-like father reads the sacred page,       How Abram was the friend of God on high;       Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage       With Amalek's ungracious progeny;       Or how the royal bard did groaning lie       Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;       Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;       Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;       Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.         Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme,       How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;       How He, who bore in Heaven the second name,       Had not on earth whereon to lay His head:       How His first followers and servants sped;       The precepts sage they wrote to many a land:       How he, who lone in Patmos banished,       Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand,       And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounc'd by Heaven's command.         Then, kneeling down to Heaven's Eternal King,       The saint, the father, and the husband prays:       Hope \"springs exulting on triumphant wing,\"^1       That thus they all shall meet in future days,       There, ever bask in uncreated rays,       No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear,       Together hymning their Creator's praise,       In such society, yet still more dear;       While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere         Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride,       In all the pomp of method, and of art;       When men display to congregations wide         [Footnote 1: Pope's \"Windso"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12797"],[0,"The Log of a Cowboy: A Narrative of the Old Trail Days (#20)"],[1,"first sighting them before we met. We  did not check the herd or turn out of the trail, but when the lead  came within a few hundred yards of the Indians, one buck, evidently  the chief of the band, rode forward a few rods and held up one hand,  as if commanding a halt. At the sight of this gaudily bedecked  apparition, the cattle turned out of the trail, and Flood and I rode  up to the chief, extending our hands in friendly greeting. The chief  could not speak a word of English, but made signs with his hands; when  I turned loose on him in Spanish, however, he instantly turned his  horse and signed back to his band. Two young bucks rode forward and  greeted Flood and myself in good Spanish.    On thus opening up an intelligible conversation, I called Fox  Quarternight, who spoke Spanish, and he rode up from his position of  third man in the swing and joined in the council. The two young  Indians through whom we carried on the conversation were Apaches, no  doubt renegades of that tribe, and while we understood each other in  Spanish, they spoke in a heavy guttural peculiar to the Indian. Flood  opened the powwow by demanding to know the meaning of this visit. When  the question had been properly interpreted to the chief, the latter  dropped his blanket from his shoulders and dismounted from his horse.  He was a fine specimen of the Plains Indian, fully six feet in height,  perfectly proportioned, and in years well past middle life. He looked  every inch a chief, and was a natural born orator. There was a certain  easy grace to his gestures, only to be seen in people who use the sign  language, and often when he was speaking to the Apache interpreters, I  could anticipate his requests before they were translated to us,  although I did not know a word of Comanche.    Before the powwow had progressed far it was evident that begging was  its object. In his prelude, the chief laid claim to all the country in  sight as the hunting grounds of the Comanche tribe,--an intimation  that we were intruders. He spoke of the great slaughter of the buffalo  by the white hide-hunters, and the consequent hunger and poverty  amongst his people. He dwelt on the fact that he had ever counseled  peace with the whites, until now his band numbered but a few squaws  and papooses, the younger men having deserted him for other chiefs of  the tribe who advocated war on the palefaces. When he had fully stated  his position, he offered to allow us to pass through his country in  consideration of ten beeves. On receiving this proposition, all of us  dismounted, including the two Apaches, the latter seating themselves  in their own fashion, while we whites lounged on the ground in truly  American laziness, rolling cigarettes. In dealing with people who know  not the value of time, the civilized man is taken at a disadvantage,  and unless he can show an equal composure in wasting time, results  will be against him. Flood had had years of experience in dealing with  Mexicans in the land of _manana_, where all maxims regarding the value  of time are religiously discarded. So in dealing with this Indian  chief he showed no desire to hasten matters, and carefully avoided all  reference to the demand for beeves.    [Illustration: MEETING WITH INDIANS]    His first question, instead, was to know the distance to Fort Sill and  Fort Elliot. The next was how many days it would take for cavalry to  reach him. He then had us narrate the fact that when the first herd of  cattle passed through the country less than a month before, some bad  Indians had shown a very unfriendly spirit. They had taken many of the  cattle and had killed and eaten them, and now the great white man's  chief at Washington was very much displeased. If another single ox  were taken and killed by bad Indians, he would send his soldiers from  the forts to protect the cattle, even though their owners drove the  herds through the reservation of the Indians--over the grass where  their ponies grazed. He had us inform the chief that our entire herd  was intended by the great white man's chief at Washington as a present  to the Blackfeet Indians who lived in Montana, because they were good  Indians, and welcomed priests and teachers amongst them to teach them  the ways of the white man. At our foreman's request we then informed  the chief that he was under no obligation to give him even a single  beef for any privilege of passing through his country, but as the  squaws and little papooses were hungry, he would give him two beeves.    The old chief seemed not the least disconcerted, but begged for five  beeves, as many of the squaws were in the encampment across the North  Fork, those present being not quite half of his village. It was now  getting late in the day and the band seemed to be getting tired of the  parleying, a number of squaws having already set out on their return  to the village. After some further talk, Flood agreed to add another  beef, on condition they be taken to the encampment before being  killed. This was accepted, and at once the entire band set up a  chattering in view of the coming feast. The cattle had in the mean  time grazed off nearly a mile, the outfit, however, holding them under  a close herd during the powwowing. All the bucks in the band,  numbering about forty, now joined us, and we rode away to the herd. I  noticed, by the way, that quite a number of the younger braves had  arms, and no doubt they would have made a display of force had Flood's  diplomacy been of a more warlike character. While drifting the herd  back to the trail we cut out a big lame steer and two stray cows for  the Indians, who now left us and followed the beeves which were being  driven to their village.    Flood had instructed Quarternight and me to invite the two Apaches to  our camp for the night, on the promise of sugar, coffee, and tobacco.  They consulted with the old chief, and gaining his consent came with  us. We extended the hospitality of our wagon to our guests, and when  supper was over, promised them an extra beef if they would give us  particulars of the trail until it crossed the North Fork, after that  river turned west towards the Pan-handle. It was evident that they  were familiar with the country, for one of them accepted our offer,  and with his finger sketched a rude map on the ground where there had  formerly been a camp-fire. He outlined the two rivers between which we  were then encamped, and traced the trail until it crossed the North  Fork or beyond the Indian reservation. We discussed the outline of the  trail in detail for an hour, asking hundreds of unimportant questions,  but occasionally getting in a leading one, always resulting in the  information wanted. We learned that the big summer encampment of the  Comanches and Kiowas was one day's ride for a pony or two days' with  cattle up the trail, at the point where the divide between Salt and  North Fork narrows to about ten miles in width. We leeched out of them  very cautiously the information that the encampment was a large one,  and that all herds this year had given up cattle, some as many as  twenty-five head.    Having secured the information we wanted, Flood gave to each Apache a  package of Arbuckle coffee, a small sack of sugar, and both smoking  and chewing tobacco. Quarternight informed them that as the cattle  were bedded for the night, they had better remain until morning, when  he would pick them out a nice fat beef. On their consenting, Fox  stripped the wagon sheet off the wagon and made them a good bed, in  which, with their body blankets, they were as comfortable as any of  us. Neither of them was armed, so we felt no fear of them, and after  they had lain down on their couch, Flood called Quarternight and me,  and we strolled out into the darkness and reviewed the information. We  agreed that the topography of the country they had given was most  likely correct, because we could verify much of it by maps in our  possession. Another thing on which we agreed was, that there was some  means of communication between this small and seemingly peaceable band  and the main encampment of the tribe; and that more than likely our  approach would be known in the large encampment before sunrise. In  spite of the good opinion we entertained of our guests, we were also  satisfied they had lied to us when they denied they had been in the  large camp since the trail herds began to pass. This was the last  question we had asked, and the artful manner in which they had parried  it showed our guests to be no mean diplomats themselves.    Our camp was astir by daybreak, and after breakfast, as we were  catching our mounts for the day, one of the Apaches offered to take a  certain pinto horse in our _remuda_ in lieu of the promised beef, but  Flood declined the offer. On overtaking the herd after breakfast,  Quarternight cut out a fat two year old stray heifer, and he and I  assisted our guests to drive their beef several miles toward their  village. Finally bidding them farewell, we returned to the herd, when  the outfit informed us that Flood and The Rebel had ridden on ahead to  look out a crossing on the Salt Fork. From this move it was evident  that if a passable ford could be found, our foreman intended to  abandon the established route and avoid the big Indian encampment.    On the return of Priest and Flood about noon, they reported having  found an easy ford of the Salt Fork, which, from the indications of  their old trails centring from every quarter at this crossing, must  have been used by buffalo for generations. After dinner we put our  wagon in the lead, and following close at hand with the cattle, turned  off the trail about a mile above our noon camp and struck to the  westward for the crossing. This we reached and crossed early that  evening, camping out nearly five miles to the west of the river. Rain  was always to be dreaded in trail work, and when bedding down the herd  that "]]]
