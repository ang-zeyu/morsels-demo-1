Here in London our life has been exceedingly quiet, but useful. I    have met a number of excellent people, and have received some social    attention. I have done considerable work, mostly in the way of    verse. I wish you would write to John F. Ballantyne, asking him to    send you copies of the paper containing my work since I came here. I    am anxious to have you see it, particularly my poem in the Christmas    Daily News, and my tale in the Christmas number of the Chicago    America. I am just now at work on a Folklore tale of the Orkney    Islands, and I am enjoying it very much. I hope to get it off to the    paper this week. I am hoping that my two books pleased you; they are    the beginning only, for if I live I shall publish many beautiful    books. Yesterday I got a letter from a New York friend volunteering    to put up the money for publishing a new volume of verse at $20 a    copy, the number of copies to be limited to fifty. Of course I can't    accede to the proposition. But I am thinking of publishing a volume    of verse in some such elaborate style, for my verse accumulates    fast, and I love to get out lovely books! The climate here in London    is simply atrocious--either rain or fog all the time. Yet I should    not complain, for it seems to do me good. Julia is well, and she    joins me in wishing you and yours the best of God's blessings.      May you and I meet again, dear venerated friend, this side of the    happy Islands!      Ever affectionately yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    London, January 9th, 1890.      Do give my best love to Mrs. Bacon, and tell her that, being a    confirmed dyspeptic now, I forgive her that mince-pie. My permanent    address is care New York Herald Office, 110 Strand, W.C., London.    Speaking of the number of excellent people met in London, Field on his  return told with great gusto his experience at a dinner-party there at  which he was seated between the wife of a member of Parliament and  Mrs. Humphry Ward. The conversation turned upon P.T. Barnum, who was  then in London with his \"greatest show on earth.\" One of the ladies  inquired of Field if he was acquainted with the famous showman, to  which Field said he replied, with the utmost gravity and earnestness:      \"From my earliest infancy. Do you know, madame, that I owe    everything I am and hope to be to that great, good man? When he    first discovered me I was living in a tree in the wilds of Missouri,    clothed in skins and feeding on nuts and wild berries. Yes, madam.    Phineas T. Barnum took me from my mother, clothed me in the    bifurcated raiment of civilization, sent me to school, where I began    to lisp in numbers before I had mastered the multiplication table,    and I have been lisping ever since.\" Field had a peculiar hesitation    in his speech, almost amounting to the pause of an embarrassed    stutterer; and if he related this experience to the British matrons    as he rehearsed it to his friends afterward, it was small wonder    that they swallowed it with many a \"Really!\" \"How curious!\" \"Isn't    it marvellous?\"      This dinner occurred at the time when the trial of several members    of the Clan-na-gael for the murder of Dr. Cronin was in progress in    Chicago. The case was followed with as much interest in England as    in America. When Mrs. Ward learned that Field hailed from that city,    she said to him, \"I am so glad to meet somebody from Chicago, for I    am greatly interested in the town. Do tell me, did you know Dr.    Cronin or any of those horrid Clan-na-gaels?\"      \"I had the satisfaction of telling her,\" said Field, \"that Martin    Bourke (one of the suspects) and I had been very intimate friends,    and that Dan Coughlin (another) and I belonged to the same hunting    club, and had often shot buffaloes and cougars on the prairie a few    miles west of Chicago. As for Sullivan, the ice-man, I assured her    that if that man was convicted it would be a severe blow to the best    circles of the city.\" \"Still more satisfaction had I,\" Field added,    \"in the conviction that my auditor believed every one of the    preposterous yarns I told her.\"    \"The new volume\" referred to in Field's letter to Mr. Gray was that  which subsequently took the form of \"Echoes from the Sabine Farm,\"  published by his friend and fellow-bibliomaniac, Francis Wilson. The  story of how it came to be issued in that particular form is told by  Mr. Wilson in his introduction to the subscription edition. It was  originally Field's intention that I should take charge of this  publication, although I had never been consulted about it. Therefore I  was somewhat surprised on receiving the following note:      PHILADELPHIA, December 20th, 1889.    MR. SLASON THOMPSON--    DEAR SIR:    Enclosed find my check for $20 (Twenty Dollars) for No. 1 copy Mr.  Eugene Field's proposed book of \"Horace\"--printed on Japanese proof  and pasted on Whatman's hand-made paper, with etched vignettes,  initial and tail-pieces, rubricated throughout.    Very truly,    FRANCIS WILSON.      In acknowledging the receipt of Mr. Wilson's check I ventured to  question whether Field's paraphrases of Horace up to that time  warranted the elaborate setting proposed, to which I received the  following semi-indignant and semi-jocose rejoinder:      PHILADELPHIA, December 27th, 1889.    MR. SLASON THOMPSON--    REVEREND SIGNOR:    It is Mr. Field's intention to produce a Horace at $20 a copy, the  edition limited to fifty; printed on Japanese proof and pasted on  Whatman hand-made paper; rubricated throughout, with etched vignettes  and tail-pieces, and I want copy No. 1. Sometimes even the swift  citizens of Chicago must get their information from slow-going  Philadelphia. I do not know whether it is Mr. F.'s intention to have  you get out his affectionate effort, but I should hope not--being  guided, of course, by your expressed doubt and wonderment in the  matter. However, I promise not to say anything about this to Mr.  Field. I sent you the $20 so as to be in time for the copy I wish, and  I know you'll not object to holding it until Mr. Field's return, which  ought to be not later than May--as he writes. I shall also send you  other subscriptions, which you may turn over to Mr. Hobart Taylor in  the event of your discovering that gentleman has fewer qualms of  conscience than yourself in the matter. If he has not, you _must_ keep  the money as a punishment for the uncomplimentary allusion you have  made to Field's Horace.    Soit!    Very sincerely,    FRANCIS WILSON.      With the suspicious fervor of your hopeless collector of first  editions, Mr. Wilson finally decided to publish Field's renditions  from Horace himself, so as to be sure of having copy No. 1. And yet he  had the almost unheard-of magnanimity to send that cherished copy to  Field, who returned it with a prettily worded note, in which he  acknowledged his obligation to Mr. Wilson and expressed the hope that  the latter would live forever, provided he, Field, could \"live one day  longer to write his epitaph.\" Not until I came across the foregoing  letter have I understood why Wilson thwarted all Field's efforts to  present me with a copy of the precious edition of \"The Sabine Farm.\"  They profited by my advice, however, and postponed publication for two  years, Field and his brother Roswell in the meantime working  assiduously in making new paraphrases of Horace and in polishing the  old ones.    The mutations of journalism which had sent Cowen scurrying over Europe  when Field had counted on having his companionship in London carried  the former back to Washington, where he joined with some other equally  sanguine writers in the attempt to float a literary and political  periodical named The Critic. On February 15th, 1890, Field wrote to  his friend from No. 20 Alfred Square:      MY DEAR COWEN: The improvement which you boys have made in the    Critic is very marked. If you can hold out long enough, you will    win--you are bound to. You have youth, experience, and ambition upon    your side, and they are potent factors. Of course you know that my    earnest sympathies are, and will be, with you.      I am feeling quite well now. I have secured the Gladstone axe, with    documents from the grand old man proving its identity. I also have    Charles Kean's Hamlet chair, but I can't prove it. Meanwhile I    bankrupt myself buying books, letters, and play-bills. Oh, for $200!    How rich I should feel. Did you give Hawkins his two night-shirts    and the tie? And did you send the sleeping-socks to Mrs. Ballantyne?    I must send some little souvenir to Buskett. Do tell him to write to    me and tell me how he happened to leave the mountains. By the way, I    wish you would secure for me from the Postmaster-General or his    assistant a set of proofs of government stamps. I have begun making    a collection, and he will provide that much, if properly approached.    The children are well. The boys dun me regularly. Pinny is more    artful about it than the rest. He makes all sorts of promises, calls    me \"dearest papa,\" and sends me arithmetical problems he has solved    and German stories he has pilfered from his reader. Still, I am very    proud of those children; at any rate, I want to go first. Give my    love to Hawkins and his wife and to Buskett; Julia joins me in    affectionate remembrances to you all. God bless you, my beloved    friend.      EUGENE FIELD.    There was no shadow in this letter of the sorrow which was then  hovering over his home and family. Out of a cheerful heart he wrote,  \"I am feeling quite well now,\" although the mists and fogs of London  were chilling him to the marrow, while the social attentions were  tempting him to dietetic destruction. A few months after he wrote the  words, \"The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#20)"],[1,"unfairly selected three  accidental cases I will run briefly through a few others.  Thus, certain sceptics wrote that the great crime of Christianity  had been its attack on the family; it had dragged women to the  loneliness and contemplation of the cloister, away from their homes  and their children.  But, then, other sceptics (slightly more advanced)  said that the great crime of Christianity was forcing the family  and marriage upon us; that it doomed women to the drudgery of their  homes and children, and forbade them loneliness and contemplation.  The charge was actually reversed.  Or, again, certain phrases in the  Epistles or the marriage service, were said by the anti-Christians  to show contempt for woman's intellect.  But I found that the  anti-Christians themselves had a contempt for woman's intellect;  for it was their great sneer at the Church on the Continent that  \"only women\" went to it.  Or again, Christianity was reproached  with its naked and hungry habits; with its sackcloth and dried peas.  But the next minute Christianity was being reproached with its pomp  and its ritualism; its shrines of porphyry and its robes of gold.  It was abused for being too plain and for being too coloured.  Again Christianity had always been accused of restraining sexuality  too much, when Bradlaugh the Malthusian discovered that it restrained  it too little.  It is often accused in the same breath of prim  respectability and of religious extravagance.  Between the covers  of the same atheistic pamphlet I have found the faith rebuked  for its disunion, \"One thinks one thing, and one another,\"  and rebuked also for its union, \"It is difference of opinion  that prevents the world from going to the dogs.\"  In the same  conversation a free-thinker, a friend of mine, blamed Christianity  for despising Jews, and then despised it himself for being Jewish.         I wished to be quite fair then, and I wish to be quite fair now;  and I did not conclude that the attack on Christianity was all wrong.  I only concluded that if Christianity was wrong, it was very  wrong indeed.  Such hostile horrors might be combined in one thing,  but that thing must be very strange and solitary.  There are men  who are misers, and also spendthrifts; but they are rare.  There are  men sensual and also ascetic; but they are rare.  But if this mass  of mad contradictions really existed, quakerish and bloodthirsty,  too gorgeous and too thread-bare, austere, yet pandering preposterously  to the lust of the eye, the enemy of women and their foolish refuge,  a solemn pessimist and a silly optimist, if this evil existed,  then there was in this evil something quite supreme and unique.  For I found in my rationalist teachers no explanation of such  exceptional corruption.  Christianity (theoretically speaking)  was in their eyes only one of the ordinary myths and errors of mortals.  THEY gave me no key to this twisted and unnatural badness.  Such a paradox of evil rose to the stature of the supernatural.  It was, indeed, almost as supernatural as the infallibility of the Pope.  An historic institution, which never went right, is really quite  as much of a miracle as an institution that cannot go wrong.  The only explanation which immediately occurred to my mind was that  Christianity did not come from heaven, but from hell.  Really, if Jesus  of Nazareth was not Christ, He must have been Antichrist.         And then in a quiet hour a strange thought struck me like a still  thunderbolt.  There had suddenly come into my mind another explanation.  Suppose we heard an unknown man spoken of by many men.  Suppose we  were puzzled to hear that some men said he was too tall and some  too short; some objected to his fatness, some lamented his leanness;  some thought him too dark, and some too fair.  One explanation (as  has been already admitted) would be that he might be an odd shape.  But there is another explanation.  He might be the right shape.  Outrageously tall men might feel him to be short.  Very short men  might feel him to be tall.  Old bucks who are growing stout might  consider him insufficiently filled out; old beaux who were growing  thin might feel that he expanded beyond the narrow lines of elegance.  Perhaps Swedes (who have pale hair like tow) called him a dark man,  while negroes considered him distinctly blonde.  Perhaps (in short)  this extraordinary thing is really the ordinary thing; at least  the normal thing, the centre.  Perhaps, after all, it is Christianity  that is sane and all its critics that are mad--in various ways.  I tested this idea by asking myself whether there was about any  of the accusers anything morbid that might explain the accusation.  I was startled to find that this key fitted a lock.  For instance,  it was certainly odd that the modern world charged Christianity  at once with bodily austerity and with artistic pomp.  But then  it was also odd, very odd, that the modern world itself combined  extreme bodily luxury with an extreme absence of artistic pomp.  The modern man thought Becket's robes too rich and his meals too poor.  But then the modern man was really exceptional in history; no man before  ever ate such elaborate dinners in such ugly clothes.  The modern man  found the church too simple exactly where modern life is too complex;  he found the church too gorgeous exactly where modern life is too dingy.  The man who disliked the plain fasts and feasts was mad on entrees.  The man who disliked vestments wore a pair of preposterous trousers.  And surely if there was any insanity involved in the matter at all it  was in the trousers, not in the simply falling robe.  If there was any  insanity at all, it was in the extravagant entrees, not in the bread  and wine.         I went over all the cases, and I found the key fitted so far.  The fact that Swinburne was irritated at the unhappiness of Christians  and yet more irritated at their happiness was easily explained.  It was no longer a complication of diseases in Christianity,  but a complication of diseases in Swinburne.  The restraints  of Christians saddened him simply because he was more hedonist  than a healthy man should be.  The faith of Christians angered  him because he was more pessimist than a healthy man should be.  In the same way the Malthusians by instinct attacked Christianity;  not because there is anything especially anti-Malthusian about  Christianity, but because there is something a little anti-human  about Malthusianism.         Nevertheless it could not, I felt, be quite true that Christianity  was merely sensible and stood in the middle.  There was really  an element in it of emphasis and even frenzy which had justified  the secularists in their superficial criticism.  It might be wise,  I began more and more to think that it was wise, but it was not  merely worldly wise; it was not merely temperate and respectable.  Its fierce crusaders and meek saints might balance each other;  still, the crusaders were very fierce and the saints were very meek,  meek beyond all decency.  Now, it was just at this point of the  speculation that I remembered my thoughts about the martyr and  the suicide.  In that matter there had been this combination between  two almost insane positions which yet somehow amounted to sanity.  This was just such another contradiction; and this I had already  found to be true.  This was exactly one of the paradoxes in which  sceptics found the creed wrong; and in this I had found it right.  Madly as Christians might love the martyr or hate the suicide,  they never felt these passions more madly than I had felt them long  before I dreamed of Christianity.  Then the most difficult and  interesting part of the mental process opened, and I began to trace  this idea darkly through all the enormous thoughts of our theology.  The idea was that which I had outlined touching the optimist and  the pessimist; that we want not an amalgam or compromise, but both  things at the top of their energy; love and wrath both burning.  Here I shall only trace it in relation to ethics.  But I need not  remind the reader that the idea of this combination is indeed central  in orthodox theology.  For orthodox theology has specially insisted  that Christ was not a being apart from God and man, like an elf,  nor yet a being half human and half not, like a centaur, but both  things at once and both things thoroughly, very man and very God.  Now let me trace this notion as I found it.         All sane men can see that sanity is some kind of equilibrium;  that one may be mad and eat too much, or mad and eat too little.  Some moderns have indeed appeared with vague versions of progress and  evolution which seeks to destroy the MESON or balance of Aristotle.  They seem to suggest that we are meant to starve progressively,  or to go on eating larger and larger breakfasts every morning for ever.  But the great truism of the MESON remains for all thinking men,  and these people have not upset any balance except their own.  But granted that we have all to keep a balance, the real interest  comes in with the question of how that balance can be kept.  That was the problem which Paganism tried to solve:  that was  the problem which I think Christianity solved and solved in a very  strange way.         Paganism declared that virtue was in a balance; Christianity  declared it was in a conflict:  the collision of two passions  apparently opposite.  Of course they were not really inconsistent;  but they were such that it was hard to hold simultaneously.  Let us follow for a moment the clue of the martyr and the suicide;  and take the case of courage.  No quality has ever so much addled  the brains and tangled the definitions of merely rational sages.  Courage is almost a contradiction in terms.  It means a strong desire  to live taking the form of a readiness to die.  \"He that will lose  his life, the same shall save it,\" is not a piece of"]]]
