Black Bart curled up at the feet of his master and seemed to  sleep, but every now and then an ear raised or an eye twitched open.  He was on guard against a danger which he did not understand. The  horse, also, with a high head scanned the circling willows, alert; but  the man for whom the stallion and the wolf watched gave no heed to  either. There was a vacant and dreamy expression in his eye as if he  was searching his own inner heart and found there the greatest enemy  of all. All night they sat in this manner, silent, moveless; the  animals watching against the world, the man watching against himself.  Before dawn he roused himself suddenly, crossed to the sleeping  marshal, and touched him on the arm.    \"It's time we hit the trail,\" he said, as Calder sat up in the  blanket.    \"What's happened? Isn't it our job to comb the willows?\"    \"Silent ain't in the willows.\"    Calder started to his feet.    \"How do you know?\"    \"They ain't close to us, that's all I know.\"    Tex smiled incredulously.    \"I suppose,\" he said good humouredly, \"that your _instinct_ brought you  this message?\"    \"Instinct?\" repeated Dan blankly, \"I dunno.\"    Calder grew serious.    \"We'll take a chance that you may be right. At least we can ride down  the river bank and see if there are any fresh tracks in the sand. If  Silent started this morning I have an idea he'll head across the river  and line out for the railroad.\"    In twenty minutes their breakfast was eaten and they were in the  saddle. The sun had not yet risen when they came out of the willows to  the broad shallow basin of the river. In spring, when the snow of the  mountains melted, that river filled from bank to bank with a yellow  torrent; at the dry season of the year it was a dirty little creek  meandering through the sands. Down the bank they rode at a sharp trot  for a mile and a half until Black Bart, who scouted ahead of them at  his gliding wolf-trot, came to an abrupt stop. Dan spoke to Satan and  the stallion broke into a swift gallop which left the pony of Tex  Calder labouring in the rear. When they drew rein beside the wolf,  they found seven distinct tracks of horses which went down the bank  of the river and crossed the basin. Calder turned with a wide-eyed  amazement to Dan.    \"You're right again,\" he said, not without a touch of vexation in his  voice; \"but the dog stopped at these tracks. How does he know we are  hunting for Silent's crew?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Dan, \"maybe he jest suspects.\"    \"They can't have a long start of us,\" said Calder. \"Let's hit the  trail. Well get them before night.\"    \"No,\" said Dan, \"we won't.\"    \"Why won't we?\"    \"I've seen Silent's hoss, and I've ridden him. If the rest of his gang  have the same kind of hoss flesh, you c'n never catch him with that  cayuse of yours.\"    \"Maybe not today,\" said Calder, \"but in two days we'll run him down.  Seven horses can't travel as two in a long chase.\"    They started out across the basin, keeping to the tracks of Silent's  horses. It was the marshal's idea that the outlaws would head on a  fairly straight line for the railroad and accordingly when they lost  the track of the seven horses they kept to this direction. Twice  during the day they verified their course by information received once  from a range rider and once from a man in a dusty buck-board. Both of  these had sighted the fast travelling band, but each had seen it pass  an hour or two before Calder and Dan arrived. Such tidings encouraged  the marshal to keep his horse at an increasing speed; but in the  middle of the afternoon, though black Satan showed little or no signs  of fatigue, the cattle-pony was nearly blown and they were forced to  reduce their pace to the ordinary dog-trot.          CHAPTER XVII      THE PANTHER'S PAW    Evening came and still they had not sighted the outlaws. As dark fell  they drew near a house snuggled away among a group of cottonwoods.  Here they determined to spend the night, for Calder's pony was now  almost exhausted. A man of fifty came from the house in answer to  their call and showed them the way to the horse-shed. While they  unsaddled their horses he told them his name was Sam Daniels, yet  he evinced no curiosity as to the identity of his guests, and they  volunteered no information. His eyes lingered long and fondly over the  exquisite lines of Satan. From behind, from the side, and in front, he  viewed the stallion while Dan rubbed down the legs of his mount with  a care which was most foreign to the ranges. Finally the cattleman  reached out a hand toward the smoothly muscled shoulders.    It was Calder who stood nearest and he managed to strike up Daniels's  extended arm and jerk him back from the region of danger.    \"What'n hell is that for?\" exclaimed Daniels.    \"That horse is called Satan,\" said Calder, \"and when any one save his  owner touches him he lives up to his name and raises hell.\"    Before Daniels could answer, the light of his lantern fell upon Black  Bart, hitherto half hidden by the deepening shadows of the night,  but standing now at the entrance of the shed. The cattleman's teeth  clicked together and he slapped his hand against his thigh in a reach  for the gun which was not there.    \"Look behind you,\" he said to Calder. \"A wolf!\"    He made a grab for the marshal's gun, but the latter forestalled him.    \"Go easy, partner,\" he said, grinning, \"that's only the running  mate of the horse. He's not a wolf, at least not according to his  owner--and as for being wild--look at that!\"    Bart had stalked calmly into the shed and now lay curled up exactly  beneath the feet of the stallion.    The two guests received a warmer welcome from Sam Daniels' wife when  they reached the house. Their son, Buck, had been expected home  for supper, but it was too late for them to delay the meal longer.  Accordingly they sat down at once and the dinner was nearly over when  Buck, having announced himself with a whoop as he rode up, entered,  banging the door loudly behind him. He greeted the strangers with a  careless wave of the hand and sat down at the table. His mother placed  food silently before him. No explanations of his tardiness were asked  and none were offered. The attitude of his father indicated clearly  that the boy represented the earning power of the family. He was a big  fellow with broad, thick wrists, and a straight black eye. When he had  eaten, he broke into breezy conversation, and especially of a vicious  mustang he had ridden on a bet the day before.    \"Speakin' of hosses, Buck,\" said his father, \"they's a black out in  the shed right now that'd make your eyes jest nacherally pop out'n  their sockets. No more'n fifteen hands, but a reg'lar picture. Must be  greased lightnin'.\"    \"I've heard talk of these streaks of greased lightnin',\" said Buck,  with a touch of scorn, \"but I'll stack old Mike agin the best of  them.\"    \"An' there's a dog along with the hoss--a dog that's the nearest to a  wolf of any I ever seen.\"    There was a sudden change in Buck--a change to be sensed rather than  definitely noted with the eye. It was a stiffening of his body--an  alertness of which he was at pains to make no show. For almost  immediately he began to whistle softly, idly, his eyes roving  carelessly across the wall while he tilted back in his chair. Dan  dropped his hand close to the butt of his gun. Instantly, the eyes of  Buck flashed down and centered on Dan for an instant of keen scrutiny.  Certainly Buck had connected that mention of the black horse and the  wolf-dog with a disturbing idea.    When they went to their room--a room in which there was no bed and  they had to roll down their blankets on the floor--Dan opened the  window and commenced to whistle one of his own wild tunes. It seemed  to Calder that there was a break in that music here and there, and a  few notes grouped together like a call. In a moment a shadowy figure  leaped through the window, and Black Bart landed on the floor with  soft padding feet.    Recovering from his start Calder cursed softly.    \"What's the main idea?\" he asked.    Dan made a signal for a lower tone.    \"There ain't no idea,\" he answered, \"but these Daniels people--do you  know anything about them?\"    \"No. Why?\"    \"They interest me, that's all.\"    \"Anything wrong?\"    \"I guess not.\"    \"Why did you whistle for this infernal wolf? It makes me nervous to  have him around. Get out, Bart.\"    The wolf turned a languid eye upon the marshal.    \"Let him be,\" said Dan. \"I don't feel no ways nacheral without havin'  Bart around.\"    The marshal made no farther objections, and having rolled himself in  his blankets was almost immediately asleep and breathing heavily. The  moment Dan heard his companion draw breath with a telltale regularity,  he sat up again in his blankets. Bart was instantly at his side. He  patted the shaggy head lightly, and pointed towards the door.    \"Guard!\" he whispered.    Then he lay down and was immediately asleep. Bart crouched at his feet  with his head pointed directly at the door.    In other rooms there was the sound of the Daniels family going to  bed--noises distinctly heard throughout the flimsy frame of the house.  After that a deep silence fell which lasted many hours, but in that  darkest moment which just precedes the dawn, a light creaking came up  the hall. It was very faint and it occurred only at long intervals,  but at the first sound Black Bart raised his head from his paws and  stared at the door with those glowing eyes which see in the dark.    Now another sound came, still soft, regular. There was a movement of  the door. In the pitch dark a man could never have noticed it, but it  was plainly visible to the wolf. Still more visible, when the door  finally stood wide, was the form of the man who stood in the opening.  In one hand he carried a lantern thoroughly hooded,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#20)"],[1,"before dawn while lying in bed; others could greet him on  the streets. The doors of the royal residence were open all day long and  no guard was stationed at them. He was a regular visitor in the senate,  whose members he consulted in regard to all projects, and he frequently  tried cases in the Forum. Whatever measures he was prevented by old age  from reading aloud, as well as any communications that he sent to the  senate when absent, he usually caused to be read by his sons, showing  honor by this course to the legislative body. Every day he had many of the  senators and others join him at table, and he himself often dined at the  houses of his intimate friends. [Sidenote:--11--] In general, his  forethought for public interests caused him to be regarded as a real  emperor. In his ordinary existence he was sociable and lived on a footing  of equality with his subjects. He joked in unconventional manner and  rather liked jokes upon himself. In case any anonymous documents were  posted,--as happens to every emperor,--containing statements insulting to  himself, he showed no signs of disturbance but posted in turn a suitable  reply.    One day Phoebus approached him to make an apology. It seemed that once,  during Nero's reign, Vespasian when in the theatre in Greece had frowned  at the misconduct of the emperor (of which he was a witness), whereupon  Phoebus had angrily bidden him \"Go!\" And upon Vespasian's enquiring \"Where  to?\" the other had responded \"to the devil.\" [Footnote: This sentiment is  expressed in the Greek by \"to the crows.\"] Now when Phoebus apologized for  this speech the monarch did him no harm, in fact vouchsafed him no answer  at all, save a curt \"Go to the devil yourself!\"--Again, when Vologaesus  forwarded a letter to the emperor addressed as follows: \"Arsaces, King of  Kings, to Flavius Vespasian, Greeting,\" the recipient did not rebuke him  but wrote a reply couched in the same terms and added none of his imperial  titles.    [Sidenote:--12--] Helvidius Priscus, the son-in-law of Thrasea, had been  brought up in the doctrines of the Stoics and imitated Thrasea's  bluntness, though there was no occasion for it. He was at this time  praetor and instead of doing aught to increase the honor due to the  emperor he would not cease reviling him. Therefore the tribunes once  arrested him and gave him in charge of their assistants, at which  procedure Vespasian was overcome by emotion and went out of the  senate-house in tears, uttering this single exclamation only: \"A son  shall be my successor or no one at all.\"    [Sidenote: A.D. 71 (a.u. 824)] After Jerusalem had been captured Titus  returned to Italy and celebrated a triumph, both he and his father riding  in a chariot. Domitian, now in his consulship, also took part in the  festivities, mounted upon a charger. Vespasian next established in Rome  teachers of both Latin and Greek learning, who drew their pay from the  public treasury.    [Sidenote:--12--] It became strikingly clear that Vespasian hated  Helvidius Priscus not so much for personal affronts or on account of the  friends that the man had abused as because he was a turbulent fellow that  cultivated the favor of the rabble, was forever denouncing royalty and  praising democracy. Helvidius's behavior, moreover, was consistent with  his principles; he banded various men together, as if it were the function  of philosophy to insult those in power, to stir up the multitudes, to  overthrow the established order of things, and to incite people to  revolution. He was a son-in-law of Thrasea and affected to emulate the  latter's conduct: his failure to do so was striking. Thrasea lived in  Nero's time and disliked the tyrant. Even so, however, he never spoke or  behaved toward him in any insulting way: he merely refused to share in his  practices. But Helvidius had a grudge against Vespasian and would not let  him alone either in private or in public. By what he did he invited death  and for his meddlesome interference he was destined ultimately to pay the  penalty.    Mucianus desired to be honored by all and beyond all, so  that he was displeased not merely if a man insulted him but even if any  one failed to extol him greatly. Hence, just as he was never tired of  honoring those who assisted him to even the slightest extent, so his  hatred was most cruel for all who did not so conduct themselves.    Mucianus made a great number of remarkable statements to Vespasian against  the Stoics, as, for instance, that they are full of empty boasting, and if  one of them lets his beard grow long, elevates his eyebrows, wears his  fustian cape thrown carelessly back and goes barefoot, he straightway  postulates wisdom, bravery, righteousness as his own. He gives himself  great airs, even though he may not understand (as the proverb says) either  letters or swimming. They view everybody with contempt and call the man of  good family a mollycoddle, the ill-born a dwarfed intellect, a handsome  person licentious, an ugly person comely, the rich man an apostle of  greed, and the poor man a servile groveler.    And Vespasian did immediately expel from Rome all the philosophers except  Musonius: Demetrius and Hostilianus he confined upon islands. Hostilianus  would not stop, to be sure,--he happened to be conversing with somebody  when he heard about the sentence of exile against him and merely inveighed  all the more strongly against monarchy,--yet he straightway withdrew.  Demetrius even now would not yield, and Vespasian bade it be told him:  \"You are working every way to have me kill you, but I am not slaughtering  barking dogs.\"    [Sidenote:--13--] Before long many others who followed the so-called Stoic  system made themselves prominent, among whom was Demetrius the cynic.  These men, abusing the title of philosophy, kept teaching their disciples  publicly many pernicious doctrines, and in this way were gradually  corrupting [Footnote: Reading [Greek: hypodiephtheiron] (Dindorf).] some.  Under these circumstances Mucianus, influenced more by anger than by  fondness for speaking, uttered many charges against them and persuaded  Vespasian to expel all such persons from the city.    [Sidenote:--14--] This period saw also the demise of Vespasian's  concubine, Caenis. I have mentioned her because she was exceedingly  faithful and possessed naturally a most excellent memory. For instance,  her mistress Antonia, the mother of Claudius, had had her write secretly  to Tiberius about Sejanus and later had ordered the message erased, that  no trace of the same might be left. Thereupon she replied: \"It is in vain,  mistress, that you have issued this command. All of this and whatever else  you dictate to me I always carry with me in my soul and it can never be  erased.\" This is one thing I have admired about her and a second is that  Vespasian should have been so much pleased with her. This fact gave her  the greatest influence, and she collected untold wealth, so that it was  even thought that she obtained money by her independent efforts. She  received vast sums from all sources and sold to some persons offices, to  others procuratorships, the command of campaigns, priesthoods, and to some  actually imperial decisions. For Vespasian killed no one to get his money  and took care to preserve large numbers of those who freely gave it. The  person who secured the funds was his concubine, but it was suspected that  Vespasian willingly allowed her to do as she did; and this belief was  strengthened by his other acts, a few of which, for the sake of  illustration, I shall relate. When certain persons voted to erect to him a  statue costing twenty-five myriads, he stretched out his hand and said:  \"Give me the money; this [Footnote: i.e., the hollowed hand (compare  Suetonius Vespasian, chapter 23).] will serve as its pedestal.\"--And to  Titus, who was angry at the tax on urinating [Footnote: This refers to  conveniences in the public streets.], which was appointed along with the  rest, he replied, as he picked up some gold pieces that were the product  of it: \"See, my child, if they smell at all.\"    [Sidenote: A.D. 75 (a.u. 828)] [Sidenote:--15--] In the sixth year of  Vespasian as magistrate and the fourth of Titus the precinct of Peace was  dedicated and the so-called Colossus was set up on the Sacred Way. It is  said to have been one hundred feet high, and to have had--according to one  account--the figure of Nero, according to others that of Titus. Vespasian  would often have beasts slain in the theatres. He did not particularly  enjoy gladiatorial combats of men, although Titus during the youthful  sports which were celebrated in his own land had once had a sham fight in  heavy armor with Alienus. The Parthians, who fell into a war with some  peoples, asked for an alliance with him, but he did not go to their aid,  saying that it was not proper for him to interfere in other persons'  business.    Berenice was at the height of her power and consequently came to Rome  along with her brother Agrippa. [Footnote: This Agrippa, known also as  Herodes II, was an intimate friend of the Jewish historian Josephus and a  companion of Titus at the siege of Jerusalem. It was before him, moreover,  that the apostle Paul made his defence in A.D. 60.] The latter was  accorded pretorial honors, while she dwelt in the Palace and cohabited  with Titus. She expected to be married to him and behaved in all respects  as if his wife. But when he perceived that the Romans were displeased at  the situation he sent her away; for various reports were in circulation.  At this time, too, certain sophists of the cynic school managed somehow to  slip into the city: first, Diogenes entered the theatre when it was full  of men and denounced them in a long, abusive speech, for which he was  flogged; after him Heras, who showed no greater disposition to be  obedient, gave vent to many senseless bawlings in the true cynic  (dog-like)"]]]
