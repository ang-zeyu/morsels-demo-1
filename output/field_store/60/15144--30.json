A billet on  the West Coast is regarded by the man who accepts it as a sort of  sporting proposition, as a game of three innings of nine months  each, during which he matches his health against the Coast. If he  lives he wins; if he dies the Coast wins.    After Calabar, at each port off which we anchored, at Ponny,  Focardos, Lagos, Accra, Cape Coast Castle, and Sekonni, it was  always the same. Always there came over the side the man going  \"Home,\" the man who had fought with the Coast and won. He was as  excited, as jubilant as a prisoner sentenced to death who had  escaped his executioners. And always the heartiest in their  congratulations were the men who were left behind, his brother  officers, or his fellow traders, the men of the Sun Hat Brigade, in  their unofficial uniforms, in shirtwaists, broad belts from which  dangled keys and a whistle, beautifully polished tan boots, and with  a wand-like whip or stick of elephant hide. They swarmed the decks  and overwhelmed the escaping refugee with good wishes. He had  cheated their common enemy. By merely keeping alive he had achieved  a glorious victory. In their eyes he had performed a feat of  endurance like swimming the English Channel. They crowded to  congratulate him as people at the pit-mouth congratulate the  entombed miner, who, after many days of breathing noisome gases,  drinks the pure air. Even the black boys seem to feel the triumph  of the white master, and their paddles never flashed so bravely, and  their songs never rang so wildly, as when they were racing him away  from the brooding Coast with its poisonous vapors toward the big  white ship that meant health and home.    Although most of the ports we saw only from across a mile or two of  breakers, they always sent us something of interest. Sometimes all  the male passengers came on board drunk. With the miners of the Gold  Coast and the \"Palm Oil Ruffians\" it used to be a matter of  etiquette not to leave the Coast in any other condition. Not so to  celebrate your escape seemed ungenerous and ungrateful. At Sekondi  one of the miners from Ashanti was so completely drunk, that he was  swung over the side, tied up like a plum-pudding, in a bag.    When he emerged from the bag his expression of polite inquiry was  one with which all could sympathize. To lose consciousness on the  veranda of a cafe, and awake with a bump on the deck of a steamer  many miles at sea, must strengthen one's belief in magic carpets.    Another entertainment for the white passengers was when the boat  boys fought for the black passengers as they were lowered in the  mammy-chair. As a rule, in the boats from shore, there were twelve  boys to paddle and three or four extra men to handle and unhook the  mammy-chair and the luggage. While the boys with the paddles  manoeuvred to bring their boat next to the ship's side, the extra  boys tried to pull their rivals overboard, dragging their hands from  ropes and gunwales, and beating them with paddles. They did this  while every second the boat under them was spinning in the air or  diving ten feet into the hollow of the waves, and trying to smash  itself and every other boat into driftwood. From the deck the second  officer would swing a mammy-chair over the side with the idea of  dropping it into one of these boats. But before the chair could be  lowered, a rival boat would shove the first one away, and with a  third boat would be fighting for its place. Meanwhile, high above  the angry sea, the chair and its cargo of black women would be  twirling like a weathercock and banging against the ship's side. The  mammies were too terrified to scream, but the ship's officers  yelled and swore, the boat's crews shrieked, and the black babies  howled. Each baby was strapped between the shoulders of the mother.  A mammy-chair is like one of those two-seated swings in which people  sit facing one another. If to the shoulders of each person in the  swing was tied a baby, it is obvious that should the swing bump into  anything, the baby would get the worst of it. That is what happened  in the mammy-chair. Every time the chair spun around, the head of a  baby would come \"crack!\" against the ship's side. So the babies  howled, and no one of the ship's passengers, crowded six deep along  the rail, blamed them. The skull of the Ethiopian may be hard, but  it is most unfair to be swathed like a mummy so that you can neither  kick nor strike back, and then have your head battered against a  five-thousand-ton ship.    How the boys who paddled the shore boats live long enough to learn  how to handle them is a great puzzle. We were told that the method  was to take out one green boy with a crew of eleven experts. But how  did the original eleven become experts? At Accra, where the waves  are very high and rough, are the best boat boys on the coast. We  watched the Custom House boat fight her way across the two miles of  surf to the shore. The fight lasted two hours. It was as thrilling  as watching a man cross Niagara Falls on a tight-rope. The greater  part of the two hours the boat stood straight in the air, as though  it meant to shake the crew into the sea, and the rest of the time it  ran between walls of water ten feet high and was entirely lost to  sight. Two things about the paddling on the West Coast make it  peculiar; the boys sit, not on the thwarts, but on the gunwales, as  a woman rides a side-saddle, and in many parts of the coast the boys  use paddles shaped like a fork or a trident. One asks how, sitting  as they do, they are able to brace themselves, and how with their  forked paddles they obtained sufficient resistance. A coaster's  explanation of the split paddle was that the boys did not want any  more resistance than they could prevent.     [Illustration: The Kroo Boys Sit, Not On the Thwarts, but On the   Gunwales, as a Woman Rides a Side Saddle.]    There is no more royal manner of progress than when one of these  boats lifts you over the waves, with the boys chanting some wild  chorus, with their bare bodies glistening, their teeth and eyes  shining, the splendid muscles straining, and the dripping paddles  flashing like twelve mirrors.    Some of the chiefs have canoes of as much as sixty men-power,  and when these men sing, and their bodies and voices are in  unison, a war canoe seems the only means of locomotion, and a  sixty-horse-power racing car becomes a vehicle suited only to the  newly rich.    I knew I had left the West Coast when, the very night we sailed from  Sierra Leone, for greater comfort, I reached for a linen bed-spread  that during four stifling, reeking weeks had lain undisturbed at the  foot of the berth. During that time I had hated it as a monstrous  thing; as something as hot and heavy as a red flannel blanket, as a  buffalo robe. And when, on the following night, I found the  wind-screen was not in the air port, and that, nevertheless, I still  was alive, I knew we had passed out of reach of the Equator, and  that all that followed would be as conventional as the \"trippers\"  who joined us at the Canary Isles; and as familiar as the low, gray  skies, the green, rain-soaked hills, and the complaining Channel  gulls that convoyed us into Plymouth Harbor.          VII    ALONG THE EAST COAST      Were a man picked up on a flying carpet and dropped without warning  into Lorenco Marquez, he might guess for a day before he could make  up his mind where he was, or determine to which nation the place  belonged.    If he argued from the adobe houses with red-tiled roofs and walls of  cobalt blue, the palms, and the yellow custom-house, he might think  he was in Santiago; the Indian merchants in velvet and gold  embroideries seated in deep, dark shops which breathe out dry,  pungent odors, might take him back to Bombay; the Soudanese and  Egyptians in long blue night-gowns and freshly ironed fezzes would  remind him of Cairo; the dwarfish Portuguese soldiers, of Madeira,  Lisbon, and Madrid, and the black, bare-legged policemen in khaki  with great numerals on their chests, of Benin, Sierra Leone, or  Zanzibar. After he had noted these and the German, French, and  English merchants in white duck, and the Dutch man-of-warsmen, who  look like ship's stewards, the French marines in coal-scuttle  helmets, the British Jack-tars in their bare feet, and the native  Kaffir women, each wrapped in a single, gorgeous shawl with a black  baby peering from beneath her shoulder-blades, he would decide, by  using the deductive methods of Sherlock Holmes, that he was in the  Midway of the Chicago Fair.    Several hundred years ago Da Gama sailed into Delagoa Bay and  founded the town of Lorenco Marquez, and since that time the  Portuguese have always felt that it is only due to him and to  themselves to remain there. They have great pride of race, and they  like the fact that they possess and govern a colony. So, up to the  present time, in spite of many temptations to dispose of it, they  have made the ownership of Delagoa Bay an article of their national  religion. But their national religion does not require of them to  improve their property. And to-day it is much as it was when the  sails of Da Gama's fleet first stirred its poisonous vapors.    The harbor itself is an excellent one and the bay is twenty-two  miles along, but there is only one landing-pier, and that such a  pier as would be considered inconsistent with the dignity of the  Larchmont Yacht Club. To the town itself Portugal has been content  to contribute as her share the gatherers of taxes, collectors of  customs and dispensers of official seals. She is indifferent to the  fact that the bulk of general merchandise, wine, and machinery that  enter her port is brought there by foreigners. She only demands that  they buy her stamps. Her importance in her own colony is that of a  toll-gate at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#20)"],[1,"thing for a throbbing brow; she knew of no spell upon it that would work  destruction for her who lost it. \"Let me tie it round your head,\" she  said to Othello; \"you will be well in an hour.\" But Othello pettishly  said it was too small, and let it fall. Desdemona and he then went  indoors to dinner, and Emilia picked up the handkerchief which Iago had  often asked her to steal.    She was looking at it when Iago came in. After a few words about it he  snatched it from her, and bade her leave him.    In the garden he was joined by Othello, who seemed hungry for the worst  lies he could offer. He therefore told Othello that he had seen Cassio  wipe his mouth with a handkerchief, which, because it was spotted with  strawberries, he guessed to be one that Othello had given his wife.    The unhappy Moor went mad with fury, and Iago bade the heavens witness  that he devoted his hand and heart and brain to Othello's service. \"I  accept your love,\" said Othello. \"Within three days let me hear that  Cassio is dead.\"    Iago's next step was to leave Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's room.  Cassio saw it, and knew it was not his, but he liked the strawberry  pattern on it, and he gave it to his sweetheart Bianca and asked her to  copy it for him.    Iago's next move was to induce Othello, who had been bullying Desdemona  about the handkerchief, to play the eavesdropper to a conversation  between Cassio and himself. His intention was to talk about Cassio's  sweetheart, and allow Othello to suppose that the lady spoken of was  Desdemona.    \"How are you, lieutenant?\" asked Iago when Cassio appeared.    \"The worse for being called what I am not,\" replied Cassio, gloomily.    \"Keep on reminding Desdemona, and you'll soon be restored,\" said Iago,  adding, in a tone too low for Othello to hear, \"If Bianca could set the  matter right, how quickly it would mend!\"    \"Alas! poor rogue,\" said Cassio, \"I really think she loves me,\" and like  the talkative coxcomb he was, Cassio was led on to boast of Bianca's  fondness for him, while Othello imagined, with choked rage, that he  prattled of Desdemona, and thought, \"I see your nose, Cassio, but not  the dog I shall throw it to.\"    Othello was still spying when Bianca entered, boiling over with the idea  that Cassio, whom she considered her property, had asked her to copy the  embroidery on the handkerchief of a new sweetheart. She tossed him the  handkerchief with scornful words, and Cassio departed with her.    Othello had seen Bianca, who was in station lower, in beauty and speech  inferior far, to Desdemona and he began in spite of himself to praise  his wife to the villain before him. He praised her skill with the  needle, her voice that could \"sing the savageness out of a bear,\" her  wit, her sweetness, the fairness of her skin. Every time he praised  her Iago said something that made him remember his anger and utter it  foully, and yet he must needs praise her, and say, \"The pity of it,  Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\"    There was never in all Iago's villainy one moment of wavering. If there  had been he might have wavered then.    \"Strangle her,\" he said; and \"Good, good!\" said his miserable dupe.    The pair were still talking murder when Desdemona appeared with a  relative of Desdemona's father, called Lodovico, who bore a letter  for Othello from the Duke of Venice. The letter recalled Othello from  Cyprus, and gave the governorship to Cassio.    Luckless Desdemona seized this unhappy moment to urge once more the suit  of Cassio.    \"Fire and brimstone!\" shouted Othello.    \"It may be the letter agitates him,\" explained Lodovico to Desdemona,  and he told her what it contained.    \"I am glad,\" said Desdemona. It was the first bitter speech that  Othello's unkindness had wrung out of her.    \"I am glad to see you lose your temper,\" said Othello.    \"Why, sweet Othello?\" she asked, sarcastically; and Othello slapped her  face.    Now was the time for Desdemona to have saved her life by separation, but  she knew not her peril--only that her love was wounded to the core. \"I  have not deserved this,\" she said, and the tears rolled slowly down her  face.    Lodovico was shocked and disgusted. \"My lord,\" he said, \"this would not  be believed in Venice. Make her amends;\" but, like a madman talking in  his nightmare, Othello poured out his foul thought in ugly speech, and  roared, \"Out of my sight!\"    \"I will not stay to offend you,\" said his wife, but she lingered even in  going, and only when he shouted \"Avaunt!\" did she leave her husband and  his guests.    Othello then invited Lodovico to supper, adding, \"You are welcome, sir,  to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!\" Without waiting for a reply he left the  company.    Distinguished visitors detest being obliged to look on at family  quarrels, and dislike being called either goats or monkeys, and Lodovico  asked Iago for an explanation.    True to himself, Iago, in a round-about way, said that Othello was worse  than he seemed, and advised them to study his behavior and save him from  the discomfort of answering any more questions.    He proceeded to tell Roderigo to murder Cassio. Roderigo was out of tune  with his friend. He had given Iago quantities of jewels for Desdemona  without effect; Desdemona had seen none of them, for Iago was a thief.    Iago smoothed him with a lie, and when Cassio was leaving Bianca's  house, Roderigo wounded him, and was wounded in return. Cassio shouted,  and Lodovico and a friend came running up. Cassio pointed out Roderigo  as his assailant, and Iago, hoping to rid himself of an inconvenient  friend, called him \"Villain!\" and stabbed him, but not to death.    At the Castle, Desdemona was in a sad mood. She told Emilia that she  must leave her; her husband wished it. \"Dismiss me!\" exclaimed Emilia.  \"It was his bidding, said Desdemona; we must not displease him now.\"    She sang a song which a girl had sung whose lover had been base to  her--a song of a maiden crying by that tree whose boughs droop as though  it weeps, and she went to bed and slept.    She woke with her husband's wild eyes upon her. \"Have you prayed  to-night?\" he asked; and he told this blameless and sweet woman to ask  God's pardon for any sin she might have on her conscience. \"I would not  kill thy soul,\" he said.    He told her that Cassio had confessed, but she knew Cassio had nought to  confess that concerned her. She said that Cassio could not say anything  that would damage her. Othello said his mouth was stopped.    Then Desdemona wept, but with violent words, in spite of all her  pleading, Othello pressed upon her throat and mortally hurt her.    Then with boding heart came Emilia, and besought entrance at the door,  and Othello unlocked it, and a voice came from the bed saying, \"A  guiltless death I die.\"    \"Who did it?\" cried Emilia; and the voice said, \"Nobody--I myself.  Farewell!\"    \"'Twas I that killed her,\" said Othello.    He poured out his evidence by that sad bed to the people who came  running in, Iago among them; but when he spoke of the handkerchief,  Emilia told the truth.    And Othello knew. \"Are there no stones in heaven but thunderbolts?\" he  exclaimed, and ran at Iago, who gave Emilia her death-blow and fled.    But they brought him back, and the death that came to him later on was a  relief from torture.    They would have taken Othello back to Venice to try him there, but he  escaped them on his sword. \"A word or two before you go,\" he said to the  Venetians in the chamber. \"Speak of me as I was--no better, no worse.  Say I cast away the pearl of pearls, and wept with these hard eyes; and  say that, when in Aleppo years ago I saw a Turk beating a Venetian, I  took him by the throat and smote him thus.\"    With his own hand he stabbed himself to the heart; and ere he died his  lips touched the face of Desdemona with despairing love.          THE TAMING OF THE SHREW        There lived in Padua a gentleman named Baptista, who had two fair  daughters. The eldest, Katharine, was so very cross and ill-tempered,  and unmannerly, that no one ever dreamed of marrying her, while her  sister, Bianca, was so sweet and pretty, and pleasant-spoken, that more  than one suitor asked her father for her hand. But Baptista said the  elder daughter must marry first.    So Bianca's suitors decided among themselves to try and get some one to  marry Katharine--and then the father could at least be got to listen to  their suit for Bianca.    A gentleman from Verona, named Petruchio, was the one they thought  of, and, half in jest, they asked him if he would marry Katharine, the  disagreeable scold. Much to their surprise he said yes, that was just  the sort of wife for him, and if Katharine were handsome and rich, he  himself would undertake soon to make her good-tempered.    Petruchio began by asking Baptista's permission to pay court to his  gentle daughter Katharine--and Baptista was obliged to own that she  was anything but gentle. And just then her music master rushed in,  complaining that the naughty girl had broken her lute over his head,  because he told her she was not playing correctly.    \"Never mind,\" said Petruchio, \"I love her better than ever, and long to  have some chat with her.\"    When Katharine came, he said, \"Good-morrow, Kate--for that, I hear, is  your name.\"    \"You've only heard half,\" said Katharine, rudely.    \"Oh, no,\" said Petruchio, \"they call you plain Kate, and bonny Kate, and  sometimes Kate the shrew, and so, hearing your mildness praised in every  town, and your beauty too, I ask you for my wife.\"    \"Your wife!\" cried Kate. \"Never!\" She said some extremely disagreeable  things to him, and, I am sorry to say, ended by boxing his ears.    \"If you do that again, I'll cuff you,\" he said quietly; and still  protested, with many compliments, that he would marry none but her.    When Baptista came back, he asked at once--    \"How speed you with my daughter?\"    \"How should"]]]
