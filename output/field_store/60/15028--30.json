The  workaday shutters were pulled down, and the night life of London  had commenced. The West End was in possession of an army of pleasure  seekers, but Nicol Brinn was not among their ranks. Wearing his  tightly-buttoned dinner jacket, he stood, hands clasped behind him,  staring out of the window as Detective Inspector Wessex had found him at  noon. Only one who knew him very well could have detected the fact that  anxiety was written upon that Sioux-like face. His gaze seemed to be  directed, not so much upon the fading prospect of the park, as downward,  upon the moving multitude in the street below. Came a subdued knocking  at the door.    \"In,\" said Nicol Brinn.    Hoskins, the neat manservant, entered. \"A lady to see you, sir.\"    Nicol Brinn turned in a flash. For one fleeting instant the dynamic  force beneath the placid surface exhibited itself in every line of his  gaunt face. He was transfigured; he was a man of monstrous energy, of  tremendous enthusiasm. Then the enthusiasm vanished. He was a creature  of stone again; the familiar and taciturn Nicol Brinn, known and puzzled  over in the club lands of the world.    \"Name?\"    \"She gave none.\"    \"English?\"    \"No, sir, a foreign lady.\"    \"In.\"    Hoskins having retired, and having silently closed the door, Nicol Brinn  did an extraordinary thing, a thing which none of his friends in London,  Paris, or New York would ever have supposed him capable of doing. He  raised his clenched hands. \"Please God she has come,\" he whispered.  \"Dare I believe it? Dare I believe it?\"    The door was opened again, and Hoskins, standing just inside, announced:  \"The lady to see you, sir.\"    He stepped aside and bowed as a tall, slender woman entered the room.  She wore a long wrap trimmed with fur, the collar turned up about her  face. Three steps forward she took and stopped. Hoskins withdrew and  closed the door.    At that, while Nicol Brinn watched her with completely transfigured  features, the woman allowed the cloak to slip from her shoulders, and,  raising her head, extended both her hands, uttering a subdued cry of  greeting that was almost a sob. She was dark, with the darkness of  the East, but beautiful with a beauty that was tragic. Her eyes were  glorious wells of sadness, seeming to mirror a soul that had known a  hundred ages. Withal she had the figure of a girl, slender and supple,  possessing the poetic grace and poetry of movement born only in the  Orient.    \"Naida!\" breathed Nicol Brinn, huskily. \"Naida!\"    His high voice had softened, had grown tremulous. He extended his hands  with a groping movement The woman laughed shudderingly.    Her cloak lying forgotten upon the carpet, she advanced toward him.    She wore a robe that was distinctly Oriental without being in the  slightest degree barbaric. Her skin was strangely fair, and jewels  sparkled upon her fingers. She conjured up dreams of the perfumed luxury  of the East, and was a figure to fire the imagination. But Nicol Brinn  seemed incapable of movement; his body was inert, but his eyes were on  fire. Into the woman's face had come anxiety that was purely feminine.    \"Oh, my big American sweetheart,\" she whispered, and, approaching him  with a sort of timidity, laid her little hands upon his arm. \"Do you  still think I am beautiful?\"    \"Beautiful!\"    No man could have recognized the voice of Nicol Brinn. Suddenly his arms  were about her like bands of iron, and with a long, wondering sigh she  lay back looking up into his face, while he gazed hungrily into her  eyes. His lips had almost met hers when softly, almost inaudibly, she  sighed: \"Nicol!\"    She pronounced the name queerly, giving to i the value of ee, and almost  dropping the last letter entirely.    Their lips met, and for a moment they clung together, this woman of  the East and man of the West, in utter transgression of that law which  England's poet has laid down. It was a reunion speaking of a love so  deep as to be sacred.    Lifting the woman in his arms lightly as a baby, he carried her to the  settee between the two high windows and placed her there amid Oriental  cushions, where she looked like an Eastern queen. He knelt at her feet  and, holding both her hands, looked into her face with that wondering  expression in which there was something incredulous and something  sorrowful; a look of great and selfless tenderness. The face of Naida  was lighted up, and her big eyes filled with tears. Disengaging one of  her jewelled hands, she ruffled Nicol Brinn's hair.    \"My Nicol,\" she said, tenderly. \"Have I changed so much?\"    Her accent was quaint and fascinating, but her voice was very musical.  To the man who knelt at her feet it was the sweetest music in the world.    \"Naida,\" he whispered. \"Naida. Even yet I dare not believe that you are  here.\"    \"You knew I would come?\"    \"How was I to know that you would see my message?\"    She opened her closed left hand and smoothed out a scrap of torn paper  which she held there. It was from the \"Agony\" column of that day's  Times.    N. November 23, 1913. N. B. See Telephone Directory.    \"I told you long, long ago that I would come if ever you wanted me.\"    \"Long, long ago,\" echoed Nicol Brinn. \"To me it has seemed a century;  to-night it seems a day.\"    He watched her with a deep and tireless content. Presently her eyes  fell. \"Sit here beside me,\" she said. \"I have not long to be here. Put  your arms round me. I have something to tell you.\"    He seated himself beside her on the settee, and held her close. \"My  Naida!\" he breathed softly.    \"Ah, no, no!\" she entreated. \"Do you want to break my heart?\"    He suddenly released her, clenched his big hands, and stared down at the  carpet. \"You have broken mine.\"    Impulsively Naida threw her arms around his neck, coiling herself up  lithely and characteristically beside him.    \"My big sweetheart,\" she whispered, crooningly. \"Don't say it--don't say  it.\"    \"I have said it. It is true.\"    Turning, fiercely he seized her. \"I won't let you go!\" he cried, and  there was a strange light in his eyes. \"Before I was helpless, now I am  not. This time you have come to me, and you shall stay.\"    She shrank away from him terrified, wild-eyed. \"Oh, you forget, you  forget!\"    \"For seven years I have tried to forget. I have been mad, but to-night I  am sane.\"    \"I trusted you, I trusted you!\" she moaned.    Nicol Brinn clenched his teeth grimly for a moment, and then, holding  her averted face very close to his own, he began to speak in a low,  monotonous voice. \"For seven years,\" he said, \"I have tried to die,  because without you I did not care to live. I have gone into the bad  lands of the world and into the worst spots of those bad lands. Night  and day your eyes have watched me, and I have wakened from dreams of  your kisses and gone out to court murder. I have earned the reputation  of being something more than human, but I am not. I had everything that  life could give me except you. Now I have got you, and I am going to  keep you.\"    Naida began to weep silently. The low, even voice of Nicol Brinn ceased.  He could feel her quivering in his grasp; and, as she sobbed, slowly,  slowly the fierce light faded from his eyes.    \"Naida, my Naida, forgive me,\" he whispered.    She raised her face, looking up to him pathetically. \"I came to you, I  came to you,\" she moaned. \"I promised long ago that I would come. What  use is it, all this? You know, you know! Kill me if you like. How often  have I asked you to kill me. It would be sweet to die in your arms. But  what use to talk so? You are in great danger or you would not have asked  me to come. If you don't know it, I tell you--you are in great danger.\"    Nicol Brinn released her, stood up, and began slowly to pace about the  room. He deliberately averted his gaze from the settee. \"Something has  happened,\" he began, \"which has changed everything. Because you are here  I know that--someone else is here.\"    He was answered by a shuddering sigh, but he did not glance in the  direction of the settee.    \"In India I respected what you told me. Because you were strong, I loved  you the more. Here in England I can no longer respect the accomplice of  assassins.\"    \"Assassins? What, is this something new?\"    \"With a man's religion, however bloodthirsty it may be, I don't quarrel  so long as he sincerely believes in it. But for private assassination  I have no time and no sympathy.\" It was the old Nicol Brinn who was  speaking, coldly and incisively. \"That--something we both know about  ever moved away from those Indian hills was a possibility I had never  considered. When it was suddenly brought home to me that you, you, might  be here in London, I almost went mad. But the thing that made me realize  it was a horrible thing, a black, dastardly thing. See here.\"    He turned and crossed to where the woman was crouching, watching him  with wide-open, fearful eyes. He took both her hands and looked grimly  into her face. \"For seven years I have walked around with a silent  tongue and a broken heart. All that is finished. I am going to speak.\"    \"Ah, no, no!\" She was on her feet, her face a mask of tragedy. \"You  swore to me, you swore to me!\"    \"No oath holds good in the face of murder.\"    \"Is that why you bring me here? Is that what your message means?\"    \"My message means that because of--the thing you know about--I am  suspected of the murder.\"    \"You? You?\"    \"Yes, I, I! Good God! when I realize what your presence here means, I  wish more than ever that I had succeeded in finding death.\"    \"Please don't say it,\" came a soft, pleading voice. \"What can I do? What  do you want me to do?\"    \"I want you to release me from that vow made seven years ago.\"    Naida uttered a stifled cry. \"How is it possible? You understand that it  is not possible.\"    Nicol Brinn seized her by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#20)"],[1,"no whip, and the riders  change about so as to relieve each other. When travelling, the whip  trails behind, and can be brought with a tremendous crack that makes the  hair fly from the wretch that is struck; and Esquimaux are splendid  _shots_, so to speak. They can hit any part of a dog with certainty, but  usually rest satisfied with simply cracking the whip--a sound that  produces an answering yell of terror, whether the lash takes effect or  not.    Our hunters were clothed in their Esquimau garments, and cut the oddest  imaginable figures. They had a soft, rotund, cuddled-up appearance, that  was powerfully suggestive of comfort. The sledge carried one day's  provisions, a couple of walrus harpoons with a sufficient quantity of  rope, four muskets with the requisite ammunition, an Esquimau  cooking-lamp, two stout spears, two tarpaulins to spread on the snow,  and four blanket sleeping-bags. These last were six feet long, and just  wide enough for a man to crawl into at night, feet first.    \"What a jolly style of travelling, isn't it?\" cried Fred, as the dogs  sprang wildly forward, tearing the sledge behind them, Dumps and Poker  leading and looking as lively as crickets.    \"Well now, isn't it true that wits jump?--that's jist what I was sayin'  to meself,\" remarked O'Riley, grinning from ear to ear as he pulled the  fur-hood farther over his head, crossed his arms more firmly on his  breast, and tried to double himself up as he sat there like an overgrown  rat. \"I wouldn't exchange it wid the Lord Mayor o' London and his coach  an' six--so I wouldn't.--Arrah! have a care, Meetuck, ye baste, or ye'll  have us kilt.\"    This last exclamation was caused by the reckless driver dashing over a  piece of rough ice that nearly capsized the sledge. Meetuck did not  answer, but he looked over his shoulder with a quiet smile on his oily  countenance.    \"Ah, then, ye may laugh,\" said O'Riley with menacing look, \"but av ye  break a bone o' me body I'll--\"    Down went the dogs into a crack in the ice as he spoke, over went the  sledge and hurled them all out upon the ice.    \"Musha! but ye've done it!\"    \"Hallo, West! are you hurt?\" cried Fred anxiously, as he observed the  sailor fall heavily on the ice.    \"Oh no, sir; all right, thank you,\" replied the man, rising alertly and  limping to the sledge. \"Only knocked the skin off my shin, sir.\"    West was a quiet, serious, polite man, an American by birth, who was  much liked by the crew in consequence of a union of politeness and  modesty with a disposition to work far beyond his strength. He was not  very robust, however, and in powers of physical endurance scarcely  fitted to engage in an Arctic expedition.    \"An' don't ye think it's worth makin' inquiries about _me_?\" cried  O'Riley, who had been tossed into a crevice in the hummock, where he lay  jammed and utterly unable to move.    Fred and the Esquimau laughed heartily while O'Riley extricated himself  from his awkward position. Fortunately no damage was done, and in five  minutes they were flying over the frozen sea as madly as ever in the  direction of the point at the opposite side of Red-Snow Valley, where a  cloud of frost-smoke indicated open water.    \"Now, look you, Mr. Meetuck, av ye do that again ye'll better don't,  let me tell ye. Sure the back o' me's brack entirely,\" said O'Riley, as  he re-arranged himself with a look of comfort that belied his words.  \"Och, there ye go again,\" he cried, as the sledge suddenly fell about  six inches from a higher level to a lower, where the floe had cracked,  causing the teeth of the whole party to come together with a snap. \"A  man durs'n't spake for fear o' bitin' his tongue off.\"    \"No fee,\" said Meetuck, looking over his shoulder with a broader smirk.    \"No fee, ye lump of pork! it's a double fee I'll have to pay the dacter  an ye go on like that.\"    _No fee_ was Meetuck's best attempt at the words _no fear._ He had  picked up a little English during his brief sojourn with the sailors,  and already understood much of what was said to him; but words were as  yet few, and his manner of pronouncing them peculiar.    \"Holo! look! look!\" cried the Esquimau, suddenly checking the dogs and  leaping off the sledge.    \"Eh! what! where?\" ejaculated Fred, seizing his musket.    \"I think I see something, sir,\" said West, shading his eyes with his  hand, and gazing earnestly in the direction indicated by Meetuck.    \"So do I, be the mortial,\" said O'Riley in a hoarse whisper. \"I see the  mountains and the sky, I do, as plain as the nose on me face!\"    \"Hush! stop your nonsense, man,\" said Fred. \"I see a deer, I'm certain  of it.\"    Meetuck nodded violently to indicate that Fred was right.    \"Well, what's to be done? Luckily we are well to leeward, and it has  neither sighted nor scented us.\"    Meetuck replied by gestures and words to the effect that West and  O'Riley should remain with the dogs, and keep them quiet under the  shelter of a hummock, while he and Fred should go after the reindeer.  Accordingly, away they went, making a pretty long detour in order to  gain the shore, and come upon it under the shelter of the grounded  floes, behind which they might approach without being seen. In hurrying  along the coast they observed the footprints of a musk-ox, and also of  several Arctic hares and foxes; which delighted them much, for hitherto  they had seen none of these animals, and were beginning to be fearful  lest they should not visit that part of the coast at all. Of course Fred  knew not what sort of animals had made the tracks in question, but he  was an adept at guessing, and the satisfied looks of his companion gave  him reason to believe that he was correct in his surmises.    In half-an-hour they came within range, and Fred, after debating with  himself for some time as to the propriety of taking the first shot,  triumphed over himself, and stepping back a pace, motioned to the  Esquimau to fire. But Meetuck was an innate gentleman, and modestly  declined; so Fred advanced, took a good aim, and fired.    The deer bounded away, but stumbled as it went, showing that it was  wounded.    \"Ha! ha! Meetuck,\" exclaimed Fred, as he recharged in tremendous  excitement (taking twice as long to load in consequence), \"I've improved  a little, you see, in my shoot--oh bother this--ramrod!--tut! tut!  there, that's it.\"    Bang went Meetuck's musket at that moment, and the deer tumbled over  upon the snow.    \"Well done, old fellow!\" cried Fred, springing forward. At the same  instant a white hare darted across his path, at which he fired, without  even putting the gun to his shoulder, and knocked it over, to his own  intense amazement.    The three shots were the signal for the men to come up with the sledge,  which they did at full gallop, O'Riley driving, and flourishing the long  whip about in a way that soon entangled it hopelessly with the dogs'  traces.    \"Ah, then, ye've done it this time, ye have, sure enough. Musha! what a  purty crature it is. Now, isn't it, West? Stop, then, won't ye (to the  restive dogs); ye've broke my heart entirely, and the whip's tied up  into iver so many knots. Arrah, Meetuck! ye may drive yer coach yerself  for me, you may; I've had more nor enough of it.\"    In a few minutes the deer and the hare were lashed to the sledge--which  the Irishman asserted was a great improvement, inasmuch as the carcass  of the former made an excellent seat--and they were off again at full  gallop over the floes. They travelled without further interruption or  mishap, until they drew near to the open water, when suddenly they came  upon a deep fissure or crack in the ice about four feet wide, with water  in the bottom. Here they came to a dead stop.    \"Arrah! what's to be done now?\" inquired O'Riley.    \"Indeed I don't know,\" replied Fred, looking toward Meetuck for advice.    \"Hup, cut-up ice, mush, hurroo!\" said that fat individual. Fortunately  he followed his advice with a practical illustration of its meaning.  Seizing an axe, he ran to the nearest hummock, and chopping it down,  rolled the heaviest pieces he could move into the chasm. The others  followed his example, and in the course of an hour the place was bridged  across, and the sledge passed over. But the dogs required a good deal of  coaxing to get them to trust to this rude bridge, which their sagacity  taught them was not to be depended on like the works of nature.    A quarter of an hour's drive brought them to a place where there was  another crack of little more than two feet across. Meetuck stretched his  neck and took a steady look at this as they approached it at full  gallop. Being apparently satisfied with his scrutiny, he resumed his  look of self-satisfied placidity.    \"Look out, Meetuck--pull up!\" cried Fred in some alarm; but the Esquimau  paid no attention.    \"O morther! we're gone now for iver,\" exclaimed O'Riley, shutting his  eyes and clenching his teeth as he laid fast hold of the sides of the  sledge.    The feet of the dogs went faster and faster until they pattered on the  hard surface of the snow like rain. Round came the long whip, as O'Riley  said, \"like the shot of a young cannon,\" and the next moment they were  across, skimming over the ice on the other side like the wind.    It happened that there had been a break in the ice at this point on the  previous night, and the floes had been cemented by a sheet of ice only  an inch thick. Upon this, to the consternation even of Meetuck himself,  they now passed, and in a moment, ere they were aware, they were passing  over a smooth, black surface that undulated beneath them like the waves  of the sea, and crackled fearfully. There was nothing for it but to go  on. A moment's halt would have allowed the sledge to break through, and  leave them struggling in the water. There was no time for remark. Each  man held his breath. Meetuck sent the heavy lash with a tremendous crack  over the backs"]]]
