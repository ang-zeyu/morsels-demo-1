I cannot escape it, but  have need to flee unto Thee, that Thou mayest succour me and turn  it unto me for good.  Lord, now am I in tribulation, and it is  not well within my heart, but I am sore vexed by the suffering  which lieth upon me.  And now, O dear Father, what shall I say?  I am taken among the snares.  Save me from this hour, but for  this cause came I unto this hour,(1) that Thou mightest be  glorified when I am deeply humbled and am delivered through Thee.  Let it be Thy pleasure to deliver me;(2) for what can I do who am  poor, and without Thee whither shall I go?  Give patience this  time also.  Help me, O Lord my God, and I will not fear how much  soever I be weighed down.    2. And now amid these things what shall I say?  Lord, Thy will be  done.  I have well deserved to be troubled and weighed down.  Therefore I ought to bear, would that it be with patience, until  the tempest be overpast and comfort return.  Yet is Thine  omnipotent arm able also to take this temptation away from me,  and to lessen its power that I fall not utterly under it, even as  many a time past thou has helped me, O God, my merciful God.  And  as much as this deliverance is difficult to me, so much is it  easy to Thee, O right hand of the most Highest.    (1) John xii. 27.   (2) Psalm xl. 16.      CHAPTER XXX    Of seeking divine help, and the confidence of obtaining grace    \"My Son, I the Lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.(1)  Come unto Me, when it is not well with thee.    \"This it is which chiefly hindereth heavenly consolation, that  thou too slowly betakest thyself unto prayer.  For before thou  earnestly seekest unto Me, thou dost first seek after many means  of comfort, and refresheth thyself in outward things: so it cometh  to pass that all things profit thee but little until thou learn  that it is I who deliver those who trust in Me; neither beside Me  is there any strong help, nor profitable counsel, nor enduring  remedy.  But now, recovering courage after the tempest, grow thou  strong in the light of My mercies, for I am nigh, saith the Lord,  that I may restore all things not only as they were at the first,  but also abundantly and one upon another.    2. \"For is anything too hard for Me, or shall I be like unto one  who saith and doeth not?  Where is thy faith?  Stand fast and  with perseverance.  Be long-suffering and strong.  Consolation  will come unto thee in its due season.  Wait for Me; yea, wait; I  will come and heal thee.  It is temptation which vexeth thee, and  a vain fear which terrifieth thee.  What doth care about future  events bring thee, save sorrow upon sorrow?  Sufficient for the  day is the evil thereof.(2)  It is vain and useless to be  disturbed or lifted up about future things which perhaps will  never come.    3. \"But it is the nature of man to be deceived by fancies of this  sort, and it is a sign of a mind which is still weak to be so  easily drawn away at the suggestion of the enemy.  For he careth  not whether he deceive and beguile by true means or false;  whether he throw thee down by the love of the present or fear of  the future.  Therefore let not thy heart be troubled, neither let  it be afraid.  Believe in Me, and put thy trust in My mercy.(3)  When thou thinkest thyself far removed from Me, I am often the  nearer.  When thou reckonest that almost all is lost, then often  is greater opportunity of gain at hand.  All is not lost when  something goeth contrary to thy wishes.  Thou oughtest not to  judge according to present feeling, nor so to take or give way to  any grief which befalleth thee, as if all hope of escape were  taken away.    4. \"Think not thyself totally abandoned, although for the time I  have sent to thee some tribulation, or have even withdrawn some  cherished consolation; for this is the way to the Kingdom of  Heaven.  And without doubt it is better for thee and for all My  other servants, that ye should be proved by adversities, than  that ye should have all things as ye would.  I know thy hidden  thoughts: and that it is very needful for thy soul's health that  sometimes thou be left without relish, lest perchance thou be  lifted up by prosperity, and desirous to please thyself in that  which thou art not.  What I have given I am able to take away,  and to restore again at My good pleasure.    5. \"When I shall have given, it is Mine; when I shall have taken  away, I have not taken what is thine; for every good gift and  every perfect gift(4) is from me.  If I shall have sent upon thee  grief or any vexation, be not angry, nor let thy heart be sad; I  am able quickly to lift thee up and to change every burden into  joy.  But I am just and greatly to be praised, when I do thus  unto thee.    6. \"If thou rightly consider, and look upon it with truth, thou  oughtest never to be so sadly cast down because of adversity, but  rather shouldst rejoice and give thanks; yea, verily to count it  the highest joy that I afflict thee with sorrows and spare thee  not.  As My Father hath loved Me, so love I you;(5) thus have I  spoken unto My beloved disciples: whom I sent forth not unto  worldly joys, but to great strivings; not unto honours, but unto  contempt; not unto ease, but to labours; not unto rest, but to  bring forth much fruit with patience.  My son, remember these  words.\"    (1) Nahum i. 7.   (2) Matthew vi. 34.  (3) John xiv. 27; Psalm xiii. 5.   (4) James i. 17.  (5) John xv. 9.      CHAPTER XXXI    Of the neglect of every creature, that the Creator may be found    O Lord, I still need more grace, if I would arrive where neither  man nor any other creature may hinder me.  For so long as  anything keepeth me back, I cannot freely fly unto Thee.  He  desired eagerly thus to fly, who cried, saying, Oh that I had  wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest.  What is more peaceful than the single eye?  And what more free  than he that desireth nothing upon earth?  Therefore must a man  rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself, and  with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator  of all things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto  Thyself.  And except a man be freed from all creatures, he will  not be able to reach freely after Divine things.  Therefore few  are found who give themselves to contemplation, because few know  how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created  things.    2. For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul  and raise it above itself.  And except a man be lifted up in the  spirit, and freed from all creatures, and altogether united to  God, whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth  but little.  He who esteemeth anything great save the one only  incomprehensible, eternal, good, shall long time be little and  lie low.  For whatsoever is not God is nothing, and ought to be  counted for nothing.  Great is the difference between a godly  man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge  and given to books.  Far nobler is that doctrine which floweth  down from the divine fulness above, than that which is acquired  laboriously by human study.    3. Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not  strive to practice those things which are required thereunto.  It  is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and  external signs, and too little of thorough mortification.  I know  not how it is, and by what spirit we are led, and what we who  would be deemed spiritual are aiming at, that we give so great  labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless  things, and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at  all of our inward condition.    4. Ah, me!  Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of  doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination.  Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not  that all things belonging to us are so defiled.  For because all  flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came.  Since therefore our inmost affections are very corrupt, it  followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being  the index of a deficient inward strength.  Out of a pure heart  proceedeth the fruit of good living.    5. We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue  he acted, is not so narrowly considered.  We ask if he be strong,  rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer,  good workman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and  gentle, how devout and meditative, on these things many are  silent.  Nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man,  grace turneth its thought to the heart.  The former frequently  judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God, that it may not be  deceived.      CHAPTER XXXII    Of self-denial and the casting away all selfishness    \"My Son, thou canst not possess perfect liberty unless thou  altogether deny thyself.  All they are enslaved who are  possessors of riches, they who love themselves, the selfish, the  curious, the restless; those who ever seek after soft things, and  not after the things of Jesus Christ; those who continually plan  and devise that which will not stand.  For whatsoever cometh not  of God shall perish.  Hold fast the short and complete saying,  'Renounce all things, and thou shalt find all things; give up thy  lust, and thou shalt find rest.'  Dwell upon this in thy mind,  and when thou art full of it, thou shalt understand all things.\"    2. O Lord, this is not the work of a day, nor children's play;  verily in this short saying is enclosed all the perfection of the  religious.    3. \"My son, thou oughtest not to be turned aside, nor immediately  cast down, because thou hast heard the way of the perfect.  Rather oughtest thou to be provoked to higher aims, and at the  least "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16534"],[0,"A Young Folks' History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (#20)"],[1,"did many of the Saints think of the call? 6.

While the Saints were in Winter Quarters during the winter of 1846-7 they  were busily preparing for the march to the mountains next spring. Men for  the advance company were selected, and on April 7, 1847, they began to move  out of Winter Quarters to a place westward, where they were to gather. Ten  days later the first or pioneer camp, was ready for marching. The idea was  to have twelve times twelve men, but one became sick and had to return, so  that left one hundred and forty-three. There were besides the men three  women and two children. They had seventy-two wagons, ninety-three horses,  fifty-two mules, sixty-six oxen, nineteen cows, seventeen dogs, and some  chickens.    For three months and seventeen days this company traveled westward over  plains and mountains. During the first part of their journey they sometimes  followed a wagon road to Oregon, and sometimes they made new roads. The  shallow rivers they forded, the deep ones they built bridges over, and the  large ones they crossed in ferry boats which they built. After these  ferries had been built the pioneers sometimes took over companies on their  way to Oregon and received provisions for their pay.    [Illustration: MAP OF PIONEER ROUTE.]    The map will show you the route they took better than can be told here.    The pioneers did not know exactly where they were to locate. It was to be  in some valley of the Rocky mountains where they could live in peace, free  from mobs. When President Young was asked as to their destination, all he  could say was that he would know the place when he should see it, and that  they should continue to travel the way the Spirit of the Lord directed  them.    On their journey they often met scouts and trappers. One of the best known  of these was Col. James Bridger. He had been all through the valley of the  Great Salt Lake, he said, and he told the pioneers that they could not live  there, as nothing would grow. So sure was he of this that he offered to  give a thousand dollars for the first bushel of corn they could raise in  that valley. President Young simply said, \"Wait a little and we will show  you.\"    When they left the plains and got up in the mountains some of them became  sick with the mountain fever. Among those ailing was President Young. He  became so bad that he could not travel, so when they were in Echo canyon he  instructed Orson Pratt to take the main company on and he with a few men  would remain for a few days.    The main company, therefore, went on down Echo canyon, up Weber valley, and  across the mountains, coming down into Salt Lake valley through Emigration  canyon. President Young had told them that when they got to the open  country on crossing the mountain they were to go to the north and stop at  the first convenient place for putting in their seeds. This the company  did, and on the 23rd of July they camped on the ground where now stands the  beautiful city and county building in Salt Lake City. After offering up  their thanks to God for his preserving care, they at once got out their  tools and began to work. The season was so far advanced that if they were  to raise anything they must hurry. When they tried to plow the land, they  found it so dry and hard that some of the plows were broken. What could  they do? Then the thought came to turn the water in the creek over the land  and soak it up. This was done, and then there was no trouble to plow and  plant. This was the beginning of irrigation in this western part of the  United States.    President Young and his party followed the next day. President Wilford  Woodruff was with him and we will let him tell of it:    \"On the 24th I drove my carriage, with President Young lying on a bed in  it, into the open valley. When we came out of the canyon into full view of  the valley, I turned the side of my carriage around, open to the west, and  President Young arose from his bed and took a look at the country. While  gazing on the scene before us, he was enwrapped in vision for several  minutes. He had seen the valley before in vision, and now he saw the future  glory of Zion and of Israel as they would be, planted in the valleys of  these mountains. When the vision had passed, he said:    \"'It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.'\"    On August 26th, President Young and a company of one hundred and seven  persons, started on the return trip to Winter Quarters. On the Sweetwater  river they met two large companies of Saints on the way to the valley,  following the trail of the pioneers. There was great rejoicing, as the  Saints now for the first time knew where they were to locate. These  companies arrived safely in Salt Lake valley in September and October.    President Young and company arrived at Winter Quarters October 31. All was  well with the Saints, and they were prospering.    And now a very important event took place. From the death of Joseph the  Prophet up to this time the Church had been led by the Twelve. Now it was  decided to reorganize the First Presidency, and at a meeting held in Winter  Quarters, December 5, 1847, the Twelve chose Brigham Young as President of  the Church. He chose Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his  counselors, and these now became the First Presidency. This action of the  Twelve was sustained at a conference of the Church on the 27th.    Thus the work prospered. Many meetings were held, and the Church was set in  order. Missionaries were sent to the world, and the Saints, now that they  had another gathering place, began to flock towards the new Zion in the  mountains. Winter Quarters was deserted and a new settlement founded across  the river. It was called Kanesville (now Council Bluffs) in honor of Thomas  L. Kane who did many kind acts for the Saints.    In the spring of 1848 the Saints on the Missouri river were busy getting  ready for the move to the mountains. They started about the beginning of  June, organized into three large companies, all led by President Young.  Altogether there were 2,417 people, 793 wagons, herds of horses and cattle,  a great many sheep, pigs, chickens, etc. Here was surely, if not a nation,  a whole city moving. They followed in the trail of the first companies and  arrived in Great Salt Lake valley in September and October.    Topics.--1. The march of the pioneers. 2. Arrival in Salt Lake valley. 3.

The 25th of July, 1847, came on a Sunday, therefore the pioneers rested and  held meetings.    Monday morning work began in earnest. Plowing and planting had to be  hurried. Exploring parties were also sent out in different directions to  become acquainted with the country.    On the evening of July 28th President Young, accompanied by the Apostles,  went some distance from the camp to select a spot from which to begin  building the city. Arriving at a good location, President Young stopped,  and, striking his cane in the earth, he said: \"Here will be the temple of  our God\"--and on that spot the temple stands today. It was then decided to  lay out the city north, east, south, and west from the temple site, in ten  acre blocks, the streets to be eight rods wide and the sidewalks twenty  feet. Some time after this it was named Great Salt Lake City.    You will call to mind that some of the Mormon Battalion, owing to sickness,  did not march through to California. This company, together with some  Saints from the state of Mississippi, arrived at the pioneer camp on July  29th, thus making quite an addition to the company. The first building of  any kind erected in the valley by the Saints was a bowery built on the  temple block by the Battalion men. This was used for some time in which to  hold meetings.    It was decided not to settle on the city lots at first, but build a fort  with houses in as a protection from the Indians. The houses were built of  logs, and stood in a row, close together, which formed one side of the  fort. The other three sides were built of adobe walls. The roofs of the  houses were made of soil. The windows and doors faced the inside. Though  better than living all the winter in tents and wagons, you may imagine  these houses were not very comfortable, especially when the rain came  through the roofs onto beds, tables, stoves, etc.    [Illustration: SALT LAKE VALLEY IN 1847.]    A conference was held in the bowery on Sunday, August 22nd, where  considerable business was attended to. The Salt Lake Stake of Zion was  organized, with John Smith as president. It was shortly after this that  President Young and his company went back to Winter Quarters.    The next addition to the settlement was the Mormon Battalion from  California.    At the coming of winter all moved into the fort. That season the winter was  mild, so "]]]
