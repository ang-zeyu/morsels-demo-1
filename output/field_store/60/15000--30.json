For such was the fact! I  allude to the charming invention in his last canto, in which he supposes  himself welcomed home after a long voyage. Gay imitated it very  pleasantly in an address to Pope on the conclusion of his Homer. Some of  the persons thus honoured by Ariosto were vexed, it is said, at not being  praised highly enough; others at seeing so many praised in their company;  some at being left out of the list; and some others at being mentioned at  all! These silly people thought it taking too great a liberty! The poor  flies of a day did not know that a god had taken them in hand to give  them wings for eternity. Happily for them the names of most of these  mighty personages are not known. One or two, however, took care to make  posterity laugh. Trissino, a very great man in his day, and the would-be  restorer of the ancient epic, had the face, in return for the poet's  too honourable mention of him, to speak, in his own absurd verses, of  \"Ariosto, with that _Furioso_ of his, which pleases the vulgar:\"      \"L' Ariosto    Con quel _Furioso_ suo the piace al volgo.\"    \"_His_ poem,\" adds Panizzi, \"has the merit of not having pleased any  body[57].\" A sullen critic, Sperone (the same that afterwards plagued  Tasso), was so disappointed at being left out, that he became the poet's  bitter enemy. He talked of Ariosto taking himself for a swan and \"dying  like a goose\" (the allusion was to the fragment he left called the _Five  Cantos_). What has become of the swan Sperone? Bernardo Tasso, Torquato's  father, made a more reasonable (but which turned out to be an unfounded)  complaint, that Ariosto had established a precedent which poets would  find inconvenient. And Macchiavelli, like the true genius he was,  expressed a good-natured and flattering regret that his friend Ariosto  had left him out of his list of congratulators, in a work which was \"fine  throughout,\" and in some places \"wonderful[58].\"    The great Galileo knew Ariosto nearly by heart[59].    He is a poet whom it may require a certain amount of animal spirits to  relish thoroughly. The _air_ of his verse must agree with you before you  can perceive all its freshness and vitality. But if read with any thing  like Italian sympathy, with allowance for times and manners, and with a  _sense_ as well as _admittance_ of the different kinds of the beautiful  in poetry (two very different things), you will be almost as much charmed  with the \"divine Ariosto\" as his countrymen have been for ages.      [Footnote 1: The materials for this notice have been chiefly collected  from the poet's own writings (rich in autobiographical intimation)  and from his latest editor Panizzi. I was unable to see this writer's  principal authority, Baruffaldi, till I corrected the proofs and the  press was waiting; otherwise I might have added two or three more  particulars, not, however, of any great consequence. Panizzi is, as  usual, copious and to the purpose; and has, for the first time I believe,  critically proved the regularity and connectedness of Ariosto's plots,  as well as the hollowness of the pretensions of the house of Este to be  considered patrons of literature. It is only a pity that his _Life  of Ariosto is_ not better arranged. I have, of course, drawn my own  conclusions respecting particulars, and sometimes have thought I had  reason to differ with those who have preceded me; but not, I hope, with a  presumption unbecoming a foreigner.]    [Footnote 2: See in his Latin poems the lines beginning, \"Haec me  verbosas suasit perdiscere leges.\"  _De Diversis Amoribus._]    [Footnote 3:      \"Mio padre mi caccio con spiedi e lancie,\" &c.                                                                _Satira_ vi.

Leo's privilege is the one that so long underwent the singular obloquy of  being a bull of excommunication against all who objected to the poem! a  misconception on the part of some ignorant man, or misrepresentation by  some malignant one, which affords a remarkable warning against taking  things on trust from one writer after another.

XXVII.--Having heard of this battle, the greatest part of Aquitania  surrendered itself to Crassus, and of its own accord sent hostages, in  which number were the Tarbelli, the Bigerriones, the Preciani, the  Vocasates, the Tarusates, the Elurates, the Garites, the Ausci, the  Garumni, the Sibuzates, the Cocosates. A few [and those] most remote  nations, relying on the time of the year, because winter was at hand,  neglected to do this.    XXVIII.--About the same time Caesar, although the summer was nearly  past, yet since, all Gaul being reduced, the Morini and the Menapii  alone remained in arms, and had never sent ambassadors to him [to make a  treaty] of peace, speedily led his army thither, thinking that that war  might soon be terminated. They resolved to conduct the war on a very  different method from the rest of the Gauls; for as they perceived that  the greatest nations [of Gaul] who had engaged in war, had been routed  and overcome, and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and  morasses, they removed themselves and all their property thither. When  Caesar had arrived at the opening of these forests, and had begun to  fortify his camp, and no enemy was in the meantime seen, while our men  were dispersed on their respective duties, they suddenly rushed out from  all parts of the forest, and made an attack on our men. The latter  quickly took up arms and drove them back again to their forests; and  having killed a great many, lost a few of their own men while pursuing  them too far through those intricate places.    XXIX.--During the remaining days after this, Caesar began to cut down  the forests; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the  soldiers, while unarmed and not foreseeing it, he placed together  (opposite to the enemy) all that timber which was cut down, and piled it  up as a rampart on either flank. When a great space had been, with  incredible speed, cleared in a few days, when the cattle [of the enemy]  and the rear of their baggage-train were already seized by our men, and  they themselves were seeking for the thickest parts of the forests,  storms of such a kind came on that the work was necessarily suspended,  and, through the continuance of the rains, the soldiers could not any  longer remain in their tents. Therefore, having laid waste all their  country, [and] having burnt their villages and houses, Caesar led back  his army and stationed them in winter-quarters among the Aulerci and  Lexovii, and the other states which had made war upon him last.        BOOK IV    I.-The following winter (this was the year in which Cn. Pompey and M.  Crassus were consuls), those Germans [called] the Usipetes, and likewise  the Tenchtheri, with a great number of men, crossed the Rhine, not far  from the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea. The  motive for crossing [that river] was that, having been for several years  harassed by the Suevi, they were constantly engaged in war, and hindered  from the pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the Suevi is by far the  largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans. They are said to  possess a hundred cantons, from each of which they yearly send from  their territories for the purpose of war a thousand armed men: the  others who remain at home, maintain [both] themselves and those engaged  in the expedition. The latter again, in their turn, are in arms the year  after: the former remain at home. Thus neither husbandry nor the art and  practice of war are neglected. But among them there exists no private  and separate land; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year  in one place for the purpose of residence. They do not live much on  corn, but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh, and are much  [engaged] in hunting; which circumstance must, by the nature of their  food, and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life (for  having from boyhood been accustomed to no employment, or discipline,  they do nothing at all contrary to their inclination), both promote  their strength and render them men of vast stature of body. And to such  a habit have they brought themselves, that even in the coldest parts  they wear no clothing whatever except skins, by reason of the scantiness  of which a great portion of their body is bare, and besides they bathe  in open rivers.    II.--Merchants have access to them rather that they may have persons to  whom they may sell those things which they have taken in war, than  because they need any commodity to be imported to them. Moreover, even  as to labouring cattle, in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure,  and which they procure at a great price, the Germans do not employ such  as are imported, but those poor and ill-shaped animals which belong to  their country; these, however, they render capable of the greatest  labour by daily exercise. In cavalry actions they frequently leap from  their horses and fight on foot; and train their horses to stand still in  the very spot on which they leave them, to which they retreat with great  activity when there is occasion; nor, according to their practice, is  anything regarded as more unseemly, or more unmanly, than to use  housings. Accordingly, they have the courage, though they be themselves  but few, to advance against any number whatever of horse mounted with  housings. They on no account permit wine to be imported to them, because  they consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue,  and are rendered effeminate by that commodity.    III.--They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation that the lands  about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent, inasmuch  as [they think] that by this circumstance is indicated that a great  number of nations cannot, withstand their power; and thus on one side of  the Suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred  miles. On the other side they border on the Ubii, whose state was large  and flourishing, considering the condition of the Germans, and who are  somewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest [of the  Germans], and that because they border on the Rhine, and are much  resorted to by merchants, and are accustomed to the manners of the  Gauls, by reason of their approximity to them. Though the Suevi, after  making the attempt frequently and in several wars, could not expel this  nation from their territories, on account of the extent and population  of their state, yet they made them tributaries, and rendered them less  distinguished and powerful [than they had ever been].    IV.--In the same condition were the Usipetes and the Tenchtheri (whom we  have mentioned above), who for many years resisted the power of the  Suevi, but being at last driven from their possessions, and having  wandered through many parts of Germany, came to the Rhine, to districts  which the Menapii inhabited, and where they had lands, houses, and  villages on either side of the river. The latter people, alarmed by the  arrival of so great a multitude, removed from those houses which they  had on the other side of the river, and having placed guards on this  side the Rhine, proceeded to hinder the Germans from crossing. They,  finding themselves, after they had tried all means, unable either to  force a passage on account of their deficiency in shipping, or cross by  stealth on account of the guards of the Menapii, pretended to return to  their own settlements and districts; and, after having proceeded three  days' march, returned; and their cavalry having performed the whole of  this journey in one night, cut off the Menapii, who were ignorant of,  and did not expect [their approach, and] who, having moreover been  informed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts, had without  apprehension returned to their villages beyond the Rhine. Having slain  these, and seized their ships, they crossed the river before that part  of the Menapii, who were at peace in their settlements over the Rhine,  were apprised of [their intention]; and seizing all their houses,  maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the  winter.    V.--Caesar, when informed of these matters, fearing the fickle  disposition of the Gauls, who are easily prompted to take up  resolutions, and much addicted to change, considered that nothing was to  be entrusted to them; for it is the custom of that people to compel  travellers to stop, even against their inclination, and inquire what  they may have heard, or may know, respecting any matter; and in towns  the common people throng around merchants and force them to state from  what countries they come, and what affairs they know of there. They  often engage in resolutions concerning the most important matters,  induced by these reports and stories alone; of which they must  necessarily instantly repent, since they yield to mere unauthorised  reports; and since most people give to their questions answers framed  agreeably to their wishes.    VI.--Caesar, being aware of their custom, in order that he might not  encounter a more formidable war, sets forward to the army earlier in the  year than he was accustomed to do. When he had arrived there, he  discovered that those things, which he had suspected would occur, had  taken place; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the  states, and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine, and had  been promised that all things which they desired should be provided by  the Gauls. Allured by this hope, the Germans were then making excursions  to greater distances, and had advanced to the territories of the  Eburones and the Condrusi, who are under the protection of the Treviri.  After summoning the chiefs of Gaul, Caesar thought proper to pretend  ignorance of the things which he had discovered; and having conciliated  and confirmed their minds, and ordered some cavalry to be raised,"]]]
