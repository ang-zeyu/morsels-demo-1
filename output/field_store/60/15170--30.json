It had seemed to Mr. and Mrs. Travilla, a very kind Providence that had  sent them an excellent tutor and housekeeper, in the persons of Mr. and  Mrs. Daly, their former guests at Viamede.    Since the winter spent together there, an occasional correspondence had  been kept up between the two families, and learning from it, that Mr. Daly  was again in need of a change of climate, and that, just as they were  casting about for some suitable persons to take charge of their house and  children during their contemplated absence from home, Elsie suggested to  her husband that the situations should be offered to him and his wife.    Mr. Travilla approved, the offer was made at once, and promptly and  thankfully accepted.    Frank Daly, now a fine lad of eleven, was invited to come with his  parents, and to share his father's instructions.    They had now been in the house for more than a week, and seemed eminently  suited to the duties they had undertaken; yet home was sadly changed to  the children, deprived for the first time in their lives of the parents  whom they so dearly loved, and who so thoroughly understood and  sympathized with them.    Eddie was growing very manly, was well advanced in his studies, easy and  polished in manner, and Vi and the younger ones looked up to him with  pride and respect, as the big brother who knew a great deal, and in papa's  absence would be their leader and protector.    He, on his part was fond and proud of them all, but more especially of  Elsie and Vi, who grew daily in beauty and grace.    \"You can't think how sorely I have missed Elsie this morning,\" Vi said,  breaking a slight pause in their talk, \"and yet I am glad she went too,  she will be such a comfort to mamma and Lily; and she promised me to write  every day; which of course mamma could not find time to do.\"    \"Yes; and her absence will give you an opportunity for practice in that  line, and in being motherly to Rosie,\" Eddie said with a smile.    \"To Herbie too,\" she answered; \"we are to meet in mamma's dressing-room  every morning just as usual, only it will be a strange half hour without  mamma; but we will say our texts to each other, talk them over and read  together.\"    \"Yes, I promised mamma that I would be with you. Which way now?\" he asked,  as they came to the crossroads.    \"To the Oaks. I want to see grandpa. A caress, or even a word or smile  from him, would do me good this morning.\"    \"He may not be up.\"    \"But I think he will; you know he likes to keep early hours.\"    Mr. Dinsmore was up and pacing the veranda thoughtfully to and fro, as the  young riders came in sight.    He welcomed them with a smile, and lifting Vi from her pony, held her  close to his heart as something very dear and precious.    \"My darling,\" he said, \"your face is sad this morning; and no wonder. Yet  cheer up, we will hope to see our dear travelers at home again in a few  weeks, our poor fading flower restored to bloom and beauty.\"    He made them sit down and regale themselves with some fine fresh oranges,  which he summoned a servant to bring; their grandma, aunt and uncle joined  them presently and they were urged to stay to breakfast, but declined.  \"The little ones must not be left alone this first morning without papa  and mamma.\"    On their return Rosie, a merry, healthy, romping child of five, with a  rich creamy complexion, dark hair and eyes, forming a strong contrast to  Vi's blonde beauty, came bounding to meet them.    \"O, Vi, I've been wanting you! you'll have to be mamma to us now, you  know, till our real own mamma comes back. And, Eddie, you'll have to be  the papa. Won't he, Vi? Come, let's all go to mamma's dress-room; my verse  is ready.\"    \"What is your text, Rosie?\" Violet asked when they had reached the room,  sitting down and drawing the child to her side.    \"Take me on your lap like mamma does and I'll say it.\"    \"Now then,\" Vi said, complying with the request.    \"'When my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up.'\"    \"Who taught you that, pet?\" asked Vi, with a slight tremble in her low  sweet tones.    \"Cousin Molly. I was crying for mamma and papa and she called me in there  and told me I mustn't cry, 'cause Jesus loves me and will never, never go  away from me.\"    \"That's like my text,\" said Herbert. \"Mamma gave it to me for to-day. 'I  will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.'\"    \"And mine,\" said Harold, \"Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of  the world,'\"    \"'This God is our God forever and ever; he will be our guide even unto  death,'\" repeated Vi feelingly.    \"That's a nice one,\" said Rosie.    \"Yes,\" said Eddie, \"and this is a nice one for us to remember just now in  connection with the dear ones on their journey, and for ourselves when we  go away. Yes, now, and at all times. 'Behold I am with thee, and will keep  thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this  land.'\"    \"Isn't the Bible the sweetest book!\" exclaimed Vi, \"the Book of books; it  has a comforting word for everybody and every time of need.\"    The breakfast bell rang.    \"Oh, dear!\" cried Rosie clinging to Violet, her bosom heaving with sobs,  \"how can we go to the table and eat without papa and mamma!\"    \"Don't cry, little pet, don't cry; you know they want us to be cheerful  and make it pleasant for Mr. and Mrs. Daly,\" the others said, and with a  great effort the child swallowed her sobs; then wiping away her tears,  suffered Vi to lead her down to the breakfast room.    Mrs. Daly met them there with a smiling face, and kind motherly greeting.  Mr. Daly had a pleasant word for each, and talked so entertainingly all  through the meal, that they had scarcely time for sad or lonely thoughts.    Family worship followed immediately after breakfast, as was the custom of  the house. Mr. Daly's prayer was short, comforting them all, and simple  enough for even little Rose to understand.    There was still time for a walk before school, but first Vi went to Molly  to ask how she was, and to carry her a letter from Dick which had come by  the morning mail.    Dick was in Philadelphia studying medicine. He and Molly corresponded  regularly and she knew no greater treat than a letter from him. Vi was  glad she could carry it to her this morning, it was so great a pleasure  to be the bearer of anything so welcome.    There were no pleasanter or better furnished rooms in the house than those  appropriated to the use of the poor, dependent crippled cousin. Molly  herself tastefully and becomingly dressed, blooming, bright and cheerful,  sat in an invalid chair by the open window. She was reading, and so  absorbed in her book that she did not hear the light step of her young  relative.    Vi paused in the doorway a moment, thinking what a pretty picture Molly  made--with her intellectual countenance, clear complexion, rosy cheeks,  bright eyes and glossy braids--framed in by the vine-wreathed window.    Molly looked up, and laying aside her book, \"Ah, Vi, this is kind!\" she  said. \"Come in, do; I'm ever so glad to see you.\"    \"And what of this?\" asked Vi, holding up the letter.    \"Oh, delightful! dear old fellow, to write so soon. I was not expecting it  till to-morrow.\"    \"I knew you'd be glad,\" Vi said, putting it into her hand, \"and now I'll  just kiss you good-morning and run away, that you may enjoy it fully  before lesson time.\"    Rosie's voice was summoning Vi. The children were in the veranda ready for  their morning walk, waiting only for \"Sister Vi.\"    \"Let's go to the Oaks,\" said Rosie, slipping her hand into Vi's; \"it's a  nice shady walk, and I like to throw pebbles into the water. But I'll feed  the fishes first. See what a bag full of crumbs mammy has given me.\"    Violet was very patient and indulgent toward the little pet sister, yet  obliged to cut short her sport with the pebbles and the fishes, because  the hour for lessons drew near.          CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.        \"The lilies faintly to the roses yield,       As on thy lovely cheek they struggling vie,       And thoughts are in thy speaking eyes revealed,       Pure as the fount the prophet's rod unseal'd.\"                                         --HOFFMAN.      \"Dr. Arthur lef' dis for you, Miss Wi'let,\" said one of the maids, meeting  her young mistress on the veranda and handing her a note.    \"Cousin Arthur? was he here?\"    \"Yes, miss. He axed for you, but hadn't no time to stop, not even to see  po' Miss Molly. 'Spect somebody's mighty sick.\"    Arthur Conly had entered the medical profession, and for the last two  years had been practicing in partnership with Dr. Barton.    Vi glanced over the note and hastened to Eddie, whom she found in the  schoolroom, its only occupant at the moment.    \"Here's a note from Isa, asking me to bring Rosie and come to Roselands  for the rest of the day, after lessons are done. She thinks I must feel  lonely. It is very kind, but what shall I do about it? Rosie would enjoy  going, but would it be kind to you or the boys, or Molly?\"    \"I might take the boys over to the Oaks, but I don't know--oh, I think  Molly would probably prefer solitude, as I happen to know that she has  some writing to do. Well, what now?\" seeing a hesitating, perplexed look  on Vi's face.    \"I cannot ask permission of papa or mamma.\"    \"No, of course not; we must go to Mr. Daly for that now.\"    \"I don't like it,\" she answered coloring; \"it does seem as if nobody has  the right to control us except our father and mother, and our  grandparents.\"    \"Only that they have given him the right for the present.\"    Mr. Daly came in at that instant, and Vi, placing the note in his hand,  said \"Will you please to look at this, sir, and tell me if I may accept  the invitation?\"    \"I see no objection,\" he said, returning it with a kindly smile, \"provided  your lessons are well recited.\"    Mr. Daly was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#20)"],[1,"it. I suppose he thinks the bridge was made for him and his cows.\"    5. \"Now I must go down to the big bridge, Andy, and I want you to go with  me. I'm afraid to go through all those dark woods by myself,\" said Jenny.    6. \"But I can't go, Jenny,\" said Andrew, \"it's nearly school time now.\"    7. Andrew was a Scotch boy, and a fine fellow. He was next to the head of  his school, and he was as good at play as he was at his book.    8. Jenny Murdock, his most particular friend, was a little girl who lived  very near Andrew's home. She had no brothers or sisters, but Andrew had  always been as good as a brother to her; and, therefore, when she stood by  the water's edge that morning, just ready to burst into tears, she thought  all her troubles over when she saw Andrew coming along the road.    9. He had always helped her out of her troubles before, and she saw no  reason why he should not do it now. She had crossed the creek in search of  wild flowers, and when she wished to return had found the bridge removed,  as Andrew supposed, by old Donald McKensie, who pastured his cows on this  side of the creek.    10. This stream was not very wide, nor very deep at its  edges, but the center it was four or five feet deep; and in the  spring the water ran very swiftly, so that wading across it,  either by cattle or men, was quite a difficult undertaking. As  for Jenny, she could not get across at all without a bridge,  and there was none nearer than the wagon bridge, a mile and  a half below.    11. \"You will go with me, Andy, won't you?\" said the little girl.    12. \"And be late to school?\" said he. \"I have not been late yet, you know,  Jenny.\"    13. \"Perhaps Dominie Black will think you have been sick or had to mind  the cows,\" said Jenny.    14. \"He won't think so unless I tell him,\" said Andrew, \"and you know I  won't do that.\"    15. \"If we were to run all the way, would you be too late?\" said Jenny.    16. \"If we were to run all the way to the bridge, and I were to run all  the way back, I should not get to school till after copy time. I expect  every minute to hear the school bell ring,\" said Andrew.    17. \"But what can I do, then?\" said poor little Jenny. \"I can't wait here  till school's out, and I don't want to go up to the schoolhouse, for all  the boys to laugh at me.\"    18. \"No,\" said Andrew, reflecting very seriously, \"I must take you home  some way or other. It won't do to leave you here, and, no matter where you  might stay, your mother would be very much troubled about you.\"    19. \"Yes,\" said Jenny, \"she would think I was drowned.\"    20. Time pressed, and Jenny's countenance became more and more overcast,  but Andrew could think of no way in which he could take the little girl  home without being late and losing his standing in the school.    21. It was impossible to get her across the stream at any place nearer  than the \"big bridge;\" he would not take her that way, and make up a false  story to account for his lateness at school, and he could not leave her  alone or take her with him.    22. What was to be done? While several absurd and impracticable plans were  passing through his brain, the school bell began to ring, and he must  start immediately to reach the schoolhouse in time.    23. And now his anxiety and perplexity became more intense than ever; and  Jenny, looking up into his troubled countenance, began to cry.    24. Andrew, who had never before failed to be at the school door before  the first tap of the bell, began to despair. Was there nothing to be done?    25. Yes! a happy thought passed through his mind. How strange that he  should not have thought of it before! He would ask Dominie Black to let  him take Jenny home. What could be more sensible and straightforward than  such a plan?    26. Of course, the good old schoolmaster gave Andrew the desired  permission, and everything ended happily. But the best thing about the  whole affair was the lesson that the young Scotch boy learned that day.    27. The lesson was this: when we are puzzling our brains with plans to  help ourselves out of trouble, let us always stop a moment in our  planning, and try to think if there is not some simple way out of the  difficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. If we do  this, we shall probably find a way more easy and satisfactory than any  which we can devise.      DEFINITIONS.--8. Par-tic'u-lar, not ordinary, worthy of partic-ular  attention, chief. 13. Dom'i-nie, the Scotch name for school-master. 18.  Re-flect'ing, thinking earnestly. 20 Over-cast', cov-ered with gloom. 21.  Ac-count', to state the reasons. 22. Im--prac'ti-ca-ble, not possible. 23.  Anx-i'e-ty, care, trouble of mind. 27. De-vise', plan, contrive.      EXERCISES.--Why could not Jenny cross the stream? Whom did she ask to help  her? What can you tell about Andrew? Who was Jenny Murdock? What did Jenny  wish Andrew to do? Why could he not go with her? Would it have been right  for Andrew to have told an untruth even to help Jenny out of trouble? What  did he finally do? What does this lesson teach us to do in case of  trouble?        LI. THE GOLDEN RULE. (139)    1. To act with integrity and good faith was such a habit with Susan that  she had never before thought of examining the Golden Rule: \"All things  whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" But  the longer she reflected upon it, the stronger was her conviction that she  did not always obey the precept; at length, she appealed to her mother for  its meaning.    2. \"It implies,\" said her mother, \"in the first place, a total destruction  of all selfishness: for a man who loves himself better than his neighbors,  can never do to others as he would have others do to him. We are bound not  only to do, but to feel, toward others as we would have others feel toward  us. Remember, it is much easier to reprove the sin of others than to  overcome temptation when it assails ourselves.    3. \"A man may be perfectly honest and yet very selfish; but the command  implies something more than mere honesty; it requires charity as well as  integrity. The meaning of the command is fully explained in the parable of  the Good Samaritan. The Levite, who passed by the wounded man without  offering him assistance, may have been a man of great honesty; but he did  not do unto the poor stranger as he would have wished others to do unto  him.\"    4. Susan pondered carefully and seriously on what her mother had said.  When she thought over her past conduct, a blush of shame crept to her  cheeks, and a look of sorrow into her eyes, as many little acts of  selfishness and unkindness came back to her memory. She resolved that for  the future, both in great things and small, she would remember and follow  the Golden Rule.    5. It was not long after this that an opportunity occurred of trying  Susan's principles. One Saturday evening when she went, as usual, to  farmer Thompson's inn, to receive the price of her mother's washing for  the boarders, which amounted to five dollars, she found the farmer in the  stable yard.    6. He was apparently in a terrible rage with some horse dealers with whom  he had been bargaining. He held in his hand an open pocketbook, full of  bills; and scarcely noticing the child as she made her request, except to  swear at her, as usual, for troubling him when he was busy, he handed her  a bank note.    7. Glad to escape so easily, Susan hurried out of the gate, and then,  pausing to pin the money safely in the folds of her shawl, she discovered  that he had given her two bills instead of one. She looked around; nobody  was near to share her discovery; and her first impulse was joy at the  unexpected prize.    8. \"It is mine, all mine,\" said she to herself; \"I will buy  mother a new cloak with it, and she can give her old one to  sister Mary, and then Mary can go to the Sunday school with  me next winter. I wonder if it will not buy a pair of shoes for  brother Tom, too.\"    9. At that moment she remembered that he must have given it to her by  mistake; and therefore she had no right to it. But again the voice of the  tempter whispered, \"He gave it, and how do you know that he did not intend  to make you a present of it? Keep it; he will never know it, even if it  should be a mistake; for he had too many such bills in that great  pocketbook to miss one.\"    10. While this conflict was going on in her mind between good and evil,  she was hurrying homeward as fast as possible. Yet, before she came in  sight of her home, she had repeatedly balanced the comforts which the  money would buy against the sin of wronging her neighbor.    11. As she crossed the little bridge over the narrow creek before her  mother's door, her eye fell upon a rustic seat which they had occupied  during the conversation I have before narrated. Instantly the words of  Scripture, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so  to them,\" sounded in her ears like a trumpet.    12. Turning suddenly round, as if flying from some unseen peril, the child  hastened along the road with breathless speed until she found herself once  more at farmer Thompson's gate. \"What do you want now?\" asked the gruff  old fellow, as he saw her again at his side.    13. \"Sir, you paid me two bills, instead of one,\" said she, trembling in  every limb. \"Two bills? did I? let me see; well, so I did; but did you  just find it out? Why did you not bring it back sooner?\" Susan blushed and  hung her head.    14. \"You wanted to keep it, I suppose,\" said he. \"Well, I am glad your  mother was more honest than you, or I should have been five dollars poorer  and none the wiser.\" \"My mother knows nothing about it, sir,\" said Susan;  \"I brought it back before I went home.\"    15. The old man looked at the child, and, as he saw the tears rolling down  her checks, he seemed touched by her distress. Putting his band in his  pocket, he drew out a shilling and offered it to her.    16. "]]]
