[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1361"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Giant Cannon; Or, The Longest Shots on Record (#20)"],[1,"is the limit for doing things, sometimes.\"    \"Bless my timetable! but I agree with you,\" put in Mr. Damon.  \"But at  last we are on the way, in spite of delays.\"    This conversation took place on board one of Uncle Sam's warships,  which the President had designated to take Tom's giant cannon to the  Panama Canal.    The big gun had been lashed to the deck of the vessel, and was well  protected from the weather. In the hold the parts of the disappearing  carriage, which Tom had at last succeeded in having made, were securely  stowed. In another part of the warship were the big projectiles, some  arranged to be fired as solid shots, and others with a bursting charge.  There was also a good supply of the powerful explosive, and Tom had  taken extraordinary precautions so that it could not be tampered with.  Koku had been detailed as a sort of guard over it, and to relieve him  was a trustworthy sergeant of marines.    \"If anyone tries to dope that powder now, and spoil my test at Panama,\"  declared Tom, \"he'll wish he'd never tried it.\"    \"Especially if Koku gets hold of him,\" added Ned, grimly.    \"But I don't believe there is any danger,\" went on the young inventor.  \"I spoke about what had happened, and the ordnance board took extra  precautions to see that none but men and officers who could be  implicitly trusted had anything to do with this expedition.\"    \"You don't really believe anything like treachery would be attempted;  do you, Tom?\"    \"I don't know what to say. Certainly I can't see why anyone connected  with Uncle Sam would want to throw cold water on a plan to fortify the  canal, even if an outsider has invented the gun--I mean someone like  myself, not connected with the army or navy.\"    \"If it's anything it's jealousy,\" declared Ned, \"That General Waller--\"    \"There you go again, Ned. Let's not talk about it. Come on forward and  see what progress we are making.\"    It must not be supposed that to get the big gun aboard the vessel,  arrange for a new supply of the explosive, and for many of the great  projectiles, had been easy work. It was a task that taxed the skill and  strength of Tom and his friends to the utmost.    There had been wearying delays, especially in the matter of making the  disappearing carriage. At times it seemed as if the required  projectiles would never be finished. The powder, too, gave trouble, for  sometimes batches would be turned out that were utterly worthless.    But Tom never gave up, even when it seemed that some of the failures  were purposely made. Ned declared that there was a conspiracy against  his chum, but Tom could not see it that way.  It was due to a  combination of circumstances, he insisted.    But finally the gun had been put aboard the ship, having been  transported from the proving ground in the valley, and they were now en  route to Panama. There the giant cannon was to be set up, and tried  again. If it came up to expectations it was to be finally adopted as  the official gun for the protection of the big canal, and Tom would  receive a substantial reward.    \"And I'm confident that it will make good,\" said the young inventor to  his chum, as they paced the deck of the vessel. \"In fact, I'm so sure I  have practically engaged the Universal Steel Company to hold itself in  readiness to make several more of the guns.\"    \"But suppose Uncle Sam decides against the cannon on this second test?\"    \"Well, then I've lost out, that's all,\" declared Tom, philosophically.  \"But I don't believe they will.\"    \"It certainly is a giant cannon,\" remarked Ned, as he paused to look at  the prostrate monster, lashed to the deck, with its wrappings of  tarpaulins. \"It looks bigger here than it did when you fired the shot  that saved the town, Tom.\"    \"Yes, I suppose it does, by contrast. But let's go down and see how the  powder and shells are standing the trip. I told the captain to have  them securely lashed, so if we struck rough weather, and the vessel  rolled, they wouldn't carry away.\"    \"Especially the powder,\" put in Ned. \"If that starts to banging  around--well, I'd rather be somewhere else.\"    \"Bless my rain gauge!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Please don't say such things.  You make me nervous. You're as bad as that steel foreman.\"    \"All right, I'll be better,\" promised Ned, with a laugh.    The two chums found that every precaution had been taken in regard to  the projectiles and powder. Koku was on guard, the giant regarding the  boxes of explosive with a calm but determined eye. It would not be well  for any unauthorized hand to tamper with them.    \"Am dere anyt'ing I kin do fo' yo'-all, Massa Tom?\" inquired Eradicate,  as the young inventor and Ned prepared to go on deck again. The aged  colored man had insisted on coming as a sort of personal bodyguard to  Tom, and the latter had not the heart to refuse him. Eradicate was  desperately jealous of the giant.    \"Huh!\" Eradicate had said, \"anybody kin sit an' look at a lot ob dem  powder boxes; but 'tain't everybody what kin wait on Massa Tom. I kin,  an' I'se gwine t' do it.\" And so he had.    It was planned to proceed directly to Colon, the eastern terminus of  the canal, from New York, stopping at Santiago to transact some  government business there. The big gun was to be mounted on a barbette  near the Gatun locks, pointing out to sea, and the trial shots would be  fired over the water.    Eventually the gun would be so mounted as to swing in a circle, so as  to command the land as well as the water; and, in fact, if the  government decided to adopt Tom's giant cannon as the official  protective arm of the canal, they would all be so mounted. For, of  course, it might be possible for land as well as sea forces to attack  and try to capture the big ditch.    The first few days of the voyage were pleasant enough. The weather was  fine, and Tom was kept busy explaining to many of the officers aboard  the ship the principles of his gun, powder and projectiles. Members of  the ordnance board, who had been detailed to witness the test, were  also much interested as Tom modestly described his work on the giant  cannon.    At Santiago de Cuba, when Tom and Ned were standing near the gangway,  watching the officers returning from shore leave, for the ship was to  proceed soon, after a two days' stay, the young inventor started as he  noticed a military man walking aboard.    \"Look, Ned!\" he exclaimed, in a low voice.    \"Where?\"    \"At that man--an officer in civilian dress, I should judge--haven't you  seen him before?\"    \"I have, Tom. Now, where was it? I seem to remember his face; and yet  he wasn't dressed like this the last time I saw him.\"    \"I guess not, Ned. He had on a uniform then.\"    \"By jinks! I have it. That German officer--von Brunderger!  That's he!\"    \"You're right, Ned. And he's got his servant with him, I guess,\" and  Tom nodded toward a stolid German who was carrying the other's suitcase.    \"I wonder what he's doing aboard here?\" went on our hero's chum.    \"We'll soon know,\" spoke Tom. \"He's seen us and is nodding. We might as  well go meet him.\"    \"Ah, my good friend, Tom Swift!\" exclaimed General von Brunderger,  genially, as he grasped the hands of Tom and Ned. \"I am glad to see you  both again.\" He seemed to mean it, though he had not been especially  cordial to them at the first gun test.  \"Take my grip below,\" he said  in German to the man, \"and, Rudolph, find Lieutenant Blake and inform  him that I am on board.  I have been invited to go to Panama by  Lieutenant Blake,\" he added to Tom. \"I have never seen the big ditch  that you wonderful Americans have so nearly finished.\"    \"It is going to be a big thing,\" spoke Tom. \"I am proud that my gun is  going to help protect it.\"    \"Ah, so you were successful, then?\" and his voice expressed surprise.  \"I had not heard. And the big gun; is he here?\" Though speaking very  good English, von Brunderger occasionally lapsed into the idioms of his  Fatherland.    \"Yes, it's on board,\" said Tom. \"Are you going to Panama for any  special purpose?\"    Ned declared afterward that the German started as Tom asked this  question, but if he did the young inventor scarcely noticed it. In an  instant, however, von Brunderger was composed again.    \"I go but to see the big ditch before the water is let in,\" he replied.  \"And since your gun is to have a test I shall be glad to witness that.  You see, I am commissioned by my Kaiser to learn all that you Americans  will allow me to in reference to your ways of doing things--in the  army, the navy and in the pursuit of peace. After all, preparation for  war is the best means of securing peace. Your officers have been more  than kind and I have taken advantage of the offer to go to Panama.  Lieutenant Blake said the ship would stop here, and, as I had business  in Cuba, I came and waited. I am delighted to see you both again.\"    He went below, leaving Tom and Ned staring at one another.    \"Well, what do you think of it?\" asked Ned.    \"I don't see anything to be worried about,\" declared Tom. \"It's true  that a German once tried to make trouble for me, but this von  Brunderger is all right, as far as I can learn. He has the highest  references, and is an accredited representative of the Kaiser. You are  too suspicious, Ned, just as you were in the case of General Waller.\"    \"Maybe so.\"    From Santiago, swinging around the island of Jamaica, the warship took  her way, with the big gun, to Colon. When half way across the Caribbean  Sea they encountered rough weather.    The storm broke without any unusual preliminaries, but quickly  increased to a hurricane, and when night fell it saw the big ship  rolling and tossing in a tempestuous sea. Tom was anxious about his  big gun, but the captain assured him that double lashings would make it  perfectly safe.    Tom and Ned had seen little of the German officer that day, nor, in  fact, since he came aboard. He kept much in the quarters of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#20)"],[1," this motive spread to unmarried  as well as married women. A woman on the west coast of Africa must always  be chaste because she is first the property of her parents and afterwards  of her husband,[54] and even in the seventeenth century of Christendom so  able a thinker as Bishop Burnet furnished precisely the same reason for  feminine chastity.[55] This conception probably constituted the chief and  most persistent element furnished to the complex emotion of modesty by the  barbarous stages of human civilization.    This economic factor necessarily involved the introduction of a new moral  element into modesty. If a woman's chastity is the property of another  person, it is essential that she shall be modest in order that men may not  be tempted to incur the penalties involved by the infringement of property  rights. Thus modesty is strictly inculcated on women in order that men may  be safeguarded from temptation. The fact was overlooked that modesty is  itself a temptation. Immodesty being, on this ground, disapproved by men,  a new motive for modesty is furnished to women. In the book which the  Knight of the Tower, Landry, wrote in the fourteenth century, for the  instruction of his daughters, this factor of modesty is naively revealed.  He tells his daughters of the trouble that David got into through the  thoughtlessness of Bathsheba, and warns them that \"every woman ought  religiously to conceal herself when dressing and washing, and neither out  of vanity nor yet to attract attention show either her hair, or her neck,  or her breast, or any part which ought to be covered.\" Hinton went so far  as to regard what he termed \"body modesty,\" as entirely a custom imposed  upon women by men with the object of preserving their own virtue. While  this motive is far from being the sole source of modesty, it must  certainly be borne in mind as an inevitable outcome of the economic factor  of modesty.    In Europe it seems probable that the generally accepted conceptions of  mediaeval chivalry were not without influence in constituting the forms in  which modesty shows itself among us. In the early middle ages there seems  to have been a much greater degree of physical familiarity between the  sexes than is commonly found among barbarians elsewhere. There was  certainly considerable promiscuity in bathing and indifference to  nakedness. It seems probable, as Durkheim points out,[56] that this state  of things was modified in part by the growing force of the dictates of  Christian morality, which regarded all intimate approaches between the  sexes as sinful, and in part by the influence of chivalry with its  aesthetic and moral ideals of women, as the representative of all the  delicacies and elegancies of civilization. This ideal was regarded as  incompatible with the familiarities of the existing social relationships  between the sexes, and thus a separation, which at first existed only in  art and literature, began by a curious reaction to exert an influence on  real life.    The chief new feature--it is scarcely a new element--added to modesty when  an advanced civilization slowly emerges from barbarism is the elaboration  of its social ritual.[57] Civilization expands the range of modesty, and  renders it, at the same time, more changeable. The French seventeenth  century, and the English eighteenth, represent early stages of modern  European civilization, and they both devoted special attention to the  elaboration of the minute details of modesty. The frequenters of the Hotel  Rambouillet, the _precieuses_ satirized by Moliere, were not only engaged  in refining the language; they were refining feelings and ideas and  enlarging the boundaries of modesty.[58] In England such famous and  popular authors as Swift and Sterne bear witness to a new ardor of modesty  in the sudden reticences, the dashes, and the asterisks, which are found  throughout their works. The altogether new quality of literary prurience,  of which Sterne is still the classical example, could only have arisen on  the basis of the new modesty which was then overspreading society and  literature. Idle people, mostly, no doubt, the women in _salons_ and  drawing-rooms, people more familiar with books than with the realities of  life, now laid down the rules of modesty, and were ever enlarging it, ever  inventing new subtleties of gesture and speech, which it would be immodest  to neglect, and which are ever being rendered vulgar by use and ever  changing.        It was at this time, probably, that the custom of inventing an      arbitrary private vocabulary of words and phrases for the purpose      of disguising references to functions and parts of the body      regarded as immodest and indecent, first began to become common.      Such private slang, growing up independently in families, and      especially among women, as well as between lovers, is now almost      universal. It is not confined to any European country, and has      been studied in Italy by Niceforo (_Il Gergo_, 1897, cap. 1 and      2), who regards it as a weapon of social defence against an      inquisitive or hostile environment, since it enables things to be      said with a meaning which is unintelligible to all but the      initiated person. While it is quite true that the custom is      supported by the consciousness of its practical advantages, it      has another source in a desire to avoid what is felt to be the      vulgar immodesty of direct speech. This is sufficiently shown by      the fact that such slang is mostly concerned with the sacro-pubic      sphere. It is one of the chief contributions to the phenomena of      modesty furnished by civilization. The claims of modesty having      effected the clothing of the body, the impulse of modesty finds a      further sphere of activity--half-playful, yet wholly      imperative--in the clothing of language.        Modesty of speech has, however, a deep and primitive basis,      although in modern Europe it only became conspicuous at the      beginning of the eighteenth century. \"All over the world,\" as      Dufour put it, \"to do is good, to say is bad.\" Reticences of      speech are not adequately accounted for by the statement that      modesty tends to irradiate from the action to the words      describing the action, for there is a tendency for modesty to be      more deeply rooted in the words than in the actions. \"Modest      women,\" as Kleinpaul truly remarks, \"have a much greater horror      of saying immodest things than of doing them; they believe that      fig-leaves were especially made for the mouth.\" (Kleinpaul,      _Sprache ohne Worte_, p. 309.) It is a tendency which is linked      on to the religious and ritual feeling which we have already      found to be a factor of modesty, and which, even when applied to      language, appears to have an almost or quite instinctive basis,      for it is found among the most primitive savages, who very      frequently regard a name as too sacred or dangerous to utter.      Among the tribes of Central Australia, in addition to his      ordinary name, each individual has his sacred or secret name,      only known to the older and fully initiated members of his own      totemic group; among the Warramunga, it is not permitted to women      to utter even a man's ordinary name, though she knows it.      (Spencer and Gillen, _Northern Tribes of Central Australia_, p.      581.) In the mysterious region of sex, this feeling easily takes      root. In many parts of the world, men use among themselves, and      women use among themselves, words and even languages which they      may not use without impropriety in speaking to persons of the      opposite sex, and it has been shown that exogamy, or the fact      that the wife belongs to a different tribe, will not always      account for this phenomenon. (Crawley, _The Mystic Rose_, p. 46.)      A special vocabulary for the generative organs and functions is      very widespread. Thus, in northwest Central Queensland, there is      both a decent and an indecent vocabulary for the sexual parts; in      Mitakoodi language, for instance, _me-ne_ may be used for the      vulva in the best aboriginal society, but _koon-ja_ and _pukkil_,      which are names for the same parts, are the most blackguardly      words known to the natives. (W. Roth, _Ethnological Studies Among      the Queensland Aborigines_, p. 184.) Among the Malays, _puki_ is      also a name for the vulva which it is very indecent to utter, and      it is only used in public by people under the influence of an      obsessive nervous disorder. (W. Gilman Ellis, \"Latah,\" _Journal      of Mental Science_, Jan., 1897.) The Swahili women of Africa have      a private metaphorical language of their own, referring to sexual      matters (Zache, _Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1899, Heft 2-3, pp.      70 et seq.), and in Samoa, again, young girls have a euphemistic      name for the penis, _aualuma_, which is not that in common use      (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, 1899, Heft 1, p. 31); exactly the      same thing is found in Europe, to-day, and is sometimes more      marked among young peasant women than among those of better      social class, who often avoid, under all circumstances, the      necessity for using any definite name.        Singular as it may seem, the Romans, who in their literature      impress us by their vigorous and naked grip of the most private      facts of life, showed in familiar intercourse a dread of obscene      language--a dread ultimately founded, it is evident, on religious      grounds--far exceeding that which prevails among ourselves to-day      in civilization. \"It is remarkable,\" Dufour observes, \"that the      prostitutes of ancient Rome would have blushed to say an indecent      word in public. The little tender words used between lovers and      their mistresses were not less correct and innocent when the      mistress was"]]]
