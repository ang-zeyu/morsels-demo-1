If his sacrifice had been accepted graciously by  God, and Cain's not, it was because his deeds were good, and his  brother's wicked.[16]    But this was not the only cause of Cain's hatred toward Abel.  Partly love for a woman brought about the crime. To ensure the  propagation of the human race, a girl, destined to be his wife,  was born together with each of the sons of Adam. Abel's twin  sister was of exquisite beauty, and Cain desired her.[17]  Therefore he was constantly brooding over ways and means of  ridding himself of his brother.    The opportunity presented itself ere long. One day a sheep  belonging to Abel tramped over a field that had been planted by  Cain. In a rage, the latter called out, \"What right hast thou to  live upon my land and let thy sheep pasture yonder?\" Abel  retorted: \"What right hast thou to use the products of my sheep,  to make garments for thyself from their wool? If thou wilt take  off the wool of my sheep wherein thou art arrayed, and wilt pay  me for the flesh of the flocks which thou hast eaten, then I will  quit thy land as thou desirest, and fly into the air, if I can do  it.\" Cain thereupon said, \"And if I were to kill thee, who is  there to demand thy blood of me?\" Abel replied: \"God, who brought  us into the world, will avenge me. He will require my blood at  thine hand, if thou shouldst slay me. God is the Judge, who will  visit their wicked deeds upon the wicked, and their evil deeds  upon the evil. Shouldst thou slay me, God will know thy secret,  and He will deal out punishment unto thee.\"    These words but added to the anger of Cain, and he threw himself  upon his brother.[18] Abel was stronger than he, and he would  have got the worst of it, but at the last moment he begged for  mercy, and the gentle Abel released his hold upon him. Scarcely  did he feel himself free, when he turned against Abel once more,  and slew him. So true is the saying, \"Do the evil no good, lest  evil fall upon thee.\"[19]      THE PUNISHMENT OF CAIN    The manner of Abel's death was the most cruel conceivable. Not  knowing what injury was fatal, Cain pelted all parts of his body  with stones, until one struck him on the neck and inflicted  death.    After committing the murder, Cain resolved to flee, saying, \"My  parents will demand account of me concerning Abel, for there is  no other human being on earth.\" This thought had but passed  through his mind when God appeared unto him, and addressed him in  these words: \"Before thy parents thou canst flee, but canst thou  go out from My presence, too? 'Can any hide himself in secret  places that I shall not see him?' Alas for Abel that he showed  thee mercy, and refrained from killing thee, when he had thee in  his power! Alas that he granted thee the opportunity of slaying  him!\"    Questioned by God, \"Where is Abel thy brother?\" Cain answered:  \"Am I my brother's keeper? Thou art He who holdest watch over all  creatures, and yet Thou demandest account of me! True, I slew  him, but Thou didst create the evil inclination in me. Thou  guardest all things; why, then, didst Thou permit me to slay him?  Thou didst Thyself slay him, for hadst Thou looked with a  favorable countenance toward my offering as toward his, I had had  no reason for envying him, and I had not slain him.\" But God  said, \"The voice of thy brother's blood issuing from his many  wounds crieth out against thee,[20] and likewise the blood of all  the pious who might have sprung from the loins of Abel.\"    Also the soul of Abel denounced the murderer, for she could find  rest nowhere. She could neither soar heavenward, nor abide in the  grave with her body, for no human soul had done either  before.[21] But Cain still refused to confess his guilt. He  insisted that he had never seen a man killed, and how was he to  suppose that the stones which he threw at Abel would take his  life? Then, on account of Cain, God cursed the ground, that it  might not yield fruit unto him.[22] With a single punishment both  Cain and the earth were chastised, the earth because it retained  the corpse of Abel, and did not cast it above ground.[23]    In the obduracy of his heart, Cain spake: \"O Lord of the world!  Are there informers who denounce men before Thee? My parents are  the only living human beings, and they know naught of my deed.  Thou abidest in the heavens, and how shouldst Thou know what  things happen on earth?\" God said in reply: \"Thou fool! I carry  the whole world. I have made it, and I will bear it\"--a reply  that gave Cain the opportunity of feigning repentance. \"Thou  bearest the whole world,\" he said, \"and my sin Thou canst not  bear?[24] Verily, mine iniquity is too great to be borne! Yet,  yesterday Thou didst banish my father from Thy presence, to-day  Thou dost banish me. In sooth, it will be said, it is Thy way to  banish.\"[25]    Although this was but dissimulation, and not true repentance, yet  God granted Cain pardon, and removed the half of his chastisement  from him. Originally, the decree had condemned him to be a  fugitive and a wanderer on the earth. Now he was no longer to  roam about forever, but a fugitive he was to remain. And so much  was hard enough to have to suffer, for the earth quaked under  Cain, and all the animals, the wild and the tame, among them the  accursed serpent, gathered together and essayed to devour him in  order to avenge the innocent blood of Abel. Finally Cain could  bear it no longer, and, breaking out in tears, he cried: \"Whither  shall I go from Thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Thy  presence?\"[26] To protect him from the onslaught of the beasts,  God inscribed one letter of His Holy Name upon his forehead, and  furthermore He addressed the animals: \"Cain's punishment shall  not be like unto the punishment of future murderers. He has shed  blood, but there was none to give him instruction. Henceforth,  however, he who slays another shall himself be slain.\" Then God  gave him the dog as a protection against the wild beasts, and to  mark him as a sinner, He afflicted him with leprosy.    Cain's repentance, insincere though it was, bore a good result.  When Adam met him, and inquired what doom had been decreed  against him, Cain told how his repentance had propitiated God,  and Adam exclaimed, \"So potent is repentance, and I knew it not!\"  Thereupon he composed a hymn of praise to God, beginning with the  words, \"It is a good thing to confess thy sins unto the  Lord!\"[29]    The crime committed by Cain had baneful consequences, not for  himself alone, but for the whole of nature also. Before, the  fruits which the earth bore unto him when he tilled the ground  had tasted like the fruits of Paradise. Now his labor produced  naught but thorns and thistles.[29] The ground changed and  deteriorated at the very moment of Abel's violent end. The trees  and the plants in the part of the earth whereon the victim lived  refused to yield their fruits, on account of their grief over  him, and only at the birth of Seth those that grew in the portion  belonging to Abel began to flourish and bear again. But never did  they resume their former powers. While, before, the vine had  borne nine hundred and twenty-six different varieties of fruit,  it now brought forth but one kind. And so it was with all other  species. They will regain their pristine powers only in the world  to come.[30]    Nature was modified also by the burial of the corpse of Abel. For  a long time it lay there exposed, above ground, because Adam and  Eve knew not what to do with it. They sat beside it and wept,  while the faithful dog of Abel kept guard that birds and beasts  did it no harm. On a sudden, the mourning parents observed how a  raven scratched the earth away in one spot, and then hid a dead  bird of his own kind in the ground. Adam, following the example  of the raven, buried the body of Abel, and the raven was rewarded  by God. His young are born with white feathers, wherefore the old  birds desert them, not recognizing them as their offspring. They  take them for serpents. God feeds them until their plumage turns  black, and the parent birds return to them. As an additional  reward, God grants their petition when the ravens pray for  rain.[31]      THE INHABITANTS OF THE SEVEN EARTHS    When Adam was cast out of Paradise, he first reached the lowest  of the seven earths, the Erez, which is dark, without a ray of  light, and utterly void. Adam was terrified, particularly by the  flames of the ever-turning sword, which is on this earth. After  he had done penance, God led him to the second earth, the Adamah,  where there is light reflected from its own sky and from its  phantom-like stars and constellations. Here dwell the  phantom-like beings that issued from the union of Adam with the  spirits. They are always sad; the emotion of joy is not known to  them. They leave their own earth and repair to the one inhabited  by men, where they are changed into evil spirits. Then they  return to their abode for good, repent of their wicked deeds, and  till the ground, which, however, bears neither wheat nor any  other of the seven species.[34] In this Adamah, Cain, Abel, and  Seth were born. After the murder of Abel, Cain was sent back to  the Erez, where he was frightened into repentance by its darkness  and by the flames of the ever-turning sword. Accepting his  penitence, God permitted him to ascend to the third earth, the  Arka, which receives some light from the sun. The Arka was  surrendered to the Cainites forever, as their perpetual domain.  They till the ground, and plant trees, but they have neither  wheat nor any other of the seven species.    Some of the Cainites are giants, some of them are dwarfs. They  have two heads, wherefore they can never arrive at a decision;  they are always at loggerheads with themselves.[34] It may happen  that they are pious now, only to be inclined to do evil the next  moment.    In the Ge, the fourth earth, live"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#20)"],[1,"forth untimely births, Joseph and Pharaoh both  rolled down off their thrones, and Joseph's three hundred  heroes lost their teeth, and their heads remained forever  immobile, facing backward, as they had turned them to discover  the cause of the tumult. Yet the brethren did not venture  to approach close to Joseph, they were too greatly  ashamed of their behavior toward their brother.[281] He  sought to calm them, saying, \"Now be not grieved, nor  angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God did  send me before you to preserve life.\"    Even such kind words of exhortation did not banish their  fear, and Joseph continued to speak, \"As little as I harbor  vengeful thoughts in my heart against Benjamin, so little  do I harbor them against you.\"And still his brethren were  ill at case, and Joseph went on, \"Think you that it is possible  for me to inflict harm upon you? If the smoke of ten  candles could not extinguish one, how can one extinguish  ten?\"    At last the brethren were soothed, and they went up to  Joseph,[282] who knew each by name, and, weeping, he embraced  and kissed them all in turn. The reason why he wept  was that his prophetic spirit showed him the descendants of  his brethren enslaved by the nations.[283] Especially did he  weep upon Benjamin's neck, because he foresaw the destruction  decreed for the two Temples to be situated in the allotment  of Benjamin. And Benjamin also wept upon Joseph's  neck, for the sanctuary at Shiloh, in the territory of Joseph  which was likewise doomed to destruction.[284]    Pharaoh was well pleased with the report of the reconciliation  between Joseph and the Hebrews, for he had feared  that their dissensions might cause the ruin of Egypt, and he  sent his servants to Joseph, that they take part in his joy.  Also he sent word to Joseph that it would please him well if  his brethren took up their abode in Egypt, and he promised  to assign the best parts of the land to them for their  dwelling-place.[285]    Not all the servants of Pharaoh were in agreement with  their master concerning this invitation to the Hebrews.  Many among them were disquieted, saying, \"If one of the  sons of Jacob came hither, and he was advanced to a high  position over our heads, what evil will happen to us when  ten more come hither?\"[286]    Joseph gave all his brethren two changes of raiment, one  for use on the ordinary days of the week and one for use  on the Sabbath, for, when the cup was found with Benjamin,  they had rent their clothes, and Joseph would not have  his brethren go about in torn garments.[287] But to Benjamin  he gave five changes of raiment, though not in order to  distinguish him above his brethren. Joseph remembered  only too well what mischief his father had caused by giving  him the coat of many colors, thereby arousing the envy of  his brethren. He desired only to intimate that Mordecai, a  descendant of Benjamin, would once be arrayed in five royal  garments.[288]    Joseph presented his brethren, apparelled in their gold and  silver embroidered clothes, before Pharaoh, who was well  pleased to become acquainted with them when he saw that  they were men of heroic stature and handsome appearance.[289]  He gave them wagons, to bring their families down  into Egypt, but as they were ornamented with images of  idols, Judah burnt them,[290] and Joseph replaced them with  eleven other wagons, among them the one he had ridden in  at his accession to office, to view the land of Egypt. This  was to be used by his father on his journey to Egypt. For  each of his brothers' children, he sent raiments, and also one  hundred pieces of silver for each, but for each of the children  of Benjamin he sent ten changes of raiment. And for  the wives of his brethren he gave them rich garments of  state, such as were worn by the wives of the Pharaohs, and  also ointments and aromatic spices. To his sister Dinah he  sent silver and gold embroidered clothes, and myrrh, aloes,  and other perfumes, and such presents he gave also to the  wife and the daughters-in-law of Benjamin. For themselves  and for their wives the brethren received all sorts of precious  stones and jewelled ornaments, like those that are worn by  the Egyptian nobility.    Joseph accompanied his eleven brethren to the frontier,  and there he took leave of them with the wish that they and  all their families come down to Egypt,[291] and he enjoined  upon them, besides, three maxims to be observed by travellers:  Do not take too large steps; do not discuss Halakic  subjects, that you lose not your way; and enter the city at  the latest with the going down of the sun.[292]      JACOB RECEIVES THE GLAD TIDINGS    In blithe spirits the sons of Jacob journeyed up to the  land of Canaan, but when they reached the boundary line,  they said to one another, \"How shall we do? If we appear  before our father and tell him that Joseph is alive, he will be  greatly frightened, and he will not be inclined to believe  us.\" Besides, Joseph's last injunction to them had been to  take heed and not startle their father with the tidings of joy.    On coming close to their habitation, they caught sight of  Serah, the daughter of Asher, a very beautiful maiden, and  very wise, who was skilled in playing upon the harp. They  summoned her unto them and gave her a harp, and bade her  play before Jacob and sing that which they should tell her.  She sat down before Jacob, and, with an agreeable melody,  she sang the following words, accompanying herself upon  the harp: \"Joseph, my uncle, liveth, he ruleth over the  whole of Egypt, he is not dead!\" She repeated these words  several times, and Jacob grew more and more pleasurably  excited. His joy awakened the holy spirit in him, and he  knew that she spoke the truth.[293] The spirit of prophecy  never visits a seer when he is in a state of lassitude or in a  state of grief; it comes only together with joy. All the  years of Joseph's separation from him Jacob had had no  prophetic visions, because he was always sad, and only when  Serah's words reawakened the feeling of happiness in his  heart, the prophetic spirit again took possession of him.[294]  Jacob rewarded her therefor with the words, \"My daughter,  may death never have power over thee, for thou didst revive  my spirit.\" And so it was. Serah did not die, she entered  Paradise alive. At his bidding, she repeated the words she  had sung again and again, and they gave Jacob great joy  and delight, so that the holy spirit waxed stronger and  stronger within him.    While he was sitting thus in converse with Serah, his sons  appeared arrayed in all their magnificence, and with all the  presents that Joseph had given them, and they spake to  Jacob, saying: \"Glad tidings! Joseph our brother liveth!  He is ruler over the whole land of Egypt, and he sends thee  a message of joy.\" At first Jacob would not believe them,  but when they opened their packs, and showed him the presents  Joseph had sent to all, he could not doubt the truth of  their words any longer.[295]    Joseph had had a premonition that his father would refuse  to give his brethren credence, because they had tried to deceive  him before, and \"it is the punishment of the liar that  his words are not believed even when he speaks the truth.\"  He had therefore said to them, \"If my father will not believe  your words, tell him that when I took leave of him, to see  whether it was well with you, he had been teaching me the  law of the heifer whose neck is broken in the valley.\" When  they repeated this, every last vestige of Jacob's doubt  disappeared, and he said: \"Great is the steadfastness of my  son Joseph. In spite of all his sufferings he has remained  constant in his piety.[296] Yea, great are the benefits that  the Lord hath conferred upon me. He saved me from the  hands of Esau, and from the hands of Laban, and from the  Canaanites who pursued after me. I have tasted many joys,  and I hope to see more, but never did I hope to set eyes upon  Joseph again, and now I shall go down to him and behold  him before my death.\"[297]    Then Jacob and the members of his family put on the  clothes Joseph had sent, among them a turban for Jacob,  and they made all preparations to journey down into Egypt  and dwell there with Joseph and his family. Hearing of his  good fortune, the kings and the grandees of Canaan came  to wait upon Jacob and express sympathy with him in his  joy, and he prepared a three days' banquet for them.[298]    Jacob, however, would not go down into Egypt without  first inquiring whether it was the will of God that he should  leave the Holy Land.[299] He said, \"How can I leave the land  of my fathers, the land of my birth, the land in which the  Shekinah dwells, and go into an unclean land, inhabited by  slaves of the sons of Ham, a land wherein there is no fear of  God?\"[300] Then he brought sacrifices in honor of God, in  the expectation that a Divine vision would descend upon  him and instruct him whether to go down into Egypt or  have Joseph come up to Canaan. He feared the sojourn  in Egypt, for he remembered the vision he had had at  Beth-el on leaving his father's house,[301] and he said to God:  \"I resemble my father. As he was greedy in filling his maw,  so am I, and therefore I would go down into Egypt in consequence  of the famine. As my father preferred one son to  the other, so had I a favorite son, and therefore I would go  down into Egypt to see Joseph. But in this I do not resemble  my father, he had only himself to provide for, and  my house consists of seventy souls, and therefore am I compelled  to go down into Egypt. The blessing which my father  gave me was not fulfilled in me, but in my son Joseph, whom  peoples serve, and before whom nations bow down.\"[302]    Then the Shekinah addressed Jacob, calling his name  twice in token of love,[303] and bidding him not to fear the  Egyptian slavery foretold for the descendants"]]]
