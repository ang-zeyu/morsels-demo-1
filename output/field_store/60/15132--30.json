NOTE.--All these have the function of adjectives; but in the last  analysis of the expressions, _such_, _many_, _not_, etc., might be  considered as adverbs modifying the article.      [Sidenote: _With_ few _or_ little.]    196. The adjectives _few_ and _little_ have the negative meaning of  _not much_, _not many_, without the article; but when _a_ is put  before them, they have the positive meaning of _some_. Notice the  contrast in the following sentences:--         Of the country beyond the Mississippi _little_ more was known       than of the heart of Africa.--MCMASTER         To both must I of necessity cling, supported always by the hope       that when _a little_ time, _a few_ years, shall have tried me       more fully in their esteem, I may be able to bring them       together.--_Keats's Letters_.         _Few_ of the great characters of history have been so differently       judged as Alexander.--SMITH, _History of Greece_    [Sidenote: _With adjectives, changed to nouns_.]    197. When _the_ is used before adjectives with no substantive  following (Sec. 181 and note), these words are adjectives used as  nouns, or pure nouns; but when _an_ or _a_ precedes such words, they  are always nouns, having the regular use and inflections of nouns; for  example,--         Such are the words _a brave_ should use.--COOPER.         In the great society of wits, John Gay deserves to be _a       favorite_, and to have a good place.--THACKERAY         Only the name of one obscure epigrammatist has been embalmed for       use in the verses of _a rival_.--PEARSON.

(2) Which of the above uses it has.      Exercise.    Parse the articles in the following:--         1. It is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or bottling       a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole       atmosphere are ours.         2. Aristeides landed on the island with a body of Hoplites,       defeated the Persians and cut them to pieces to a man.         3. The wild fire that lit the eye of an Achilles can gleam no       more.         4. But it is not merely the neighborhood of the cathedral that is       mediaeval; the whole city is of a piece.         5. To the herdsman among his cattle in remote woods, to the       craftsman in his rude workshop, to the great and to the little, a       new light has arisen.         6. When the manners of Loo are heard of, the stupid become       intelligent, and the wavering, determined.         7. The student is to read history actively, and not passively.         8. This resistance was the labor of his life.         9. There was always a hope, even in the darkest hour.         10. The child had a native grace that does not invariably coexist       with faultless beauty.         11. I think a mere gent (which I take to be the lowest form of       civilization) better than a howling, whistling, clucking,       stamping, jumping, tearing savage.         12. Every fowl whom Nature has taught to dip the wing in water.         13. They seem to be lines pretty much of a length.         14. Only yesterday, but what a gulf between now and then!         15. Not a brick was made but some man had to think of the making       of that brick.         16. The class of power, the working heroes, the Cortes, the       Nelson, the Napoleon, see that this is the festivity and       permanent celebration of such as they; that fashion is funded       talent.          VERBS AND VERBALS..          VERBS.      [Sidenote: _Verb,--the word of the sentence._]    199. The term _verb_ is from the Latin _verbum_ meaning _word_:  hence it is _the_ word of a sentence. A thought cannot be expressed  without a verb. When the child cries, \"Apple!\" it means, _See_ the  apple! or I _have_ an apple! In the mariner's shout, \"A sail!\" the  meaning is, \"Yonder _is_ a sail!\"    Sentences are in the form of declarations, questions, or commands; and  none of these can be put before the mind without the use of a verb.    [Sidenote: _One group or a group of words._]    200. The verb may not always be a single word. On account of the  lack of inflections, _verb phrases_ are very frequent. Hence the verb  may consist of:    (1) _One word_; as, \"The young man _obeyed_.\"    (2) _Several words of verbal nature, making one expression_; as, (_a_)  \"Some day it _may be considered_ reasonable,\" (_b_) \"Fearing lest he  _might have been anticipated_.\"    (3) _One or more verbal words united with other words to compose one  verb phrase_: as in the sentences, (_a_) \"They knew well that this  woman _ruled over_ thirty millions of subjects;\" (_b_) \"If all the  flummery and extravagance of an army _were done away with_, the money  could be made to go much further;\" (_c_) \"It is idle cant to pretend  anxiety for the better distribution of wealth until we can devise  means by which this preying upon people of small incomes _can be put a  stop to_.\"    In (_a_), a verb and a preposition are used as one verb; in (_b_), a  verb, an adverb, and a preposition unite as a verb; in (_c_), an  article, a noun, a preposition, are united with verbs as one verb  phrase.    [Sidenote: _Definition and caution._]    201. A verb is a word used as a predicate, to say something to or  about some person or thing. In giving a definition, we consider a verb  as one word.    Now, it is indispensable to the nature of a verb that it is \"a word  used as a predicate.\" Examine the sentences in Sec. 200: In (1),  _obeyed_ is a predicate; in (2, _a_), _may be considered_ is a unit in  doing the work of one predicate; in (2, _b_), _might have been  anticipated_ is also one predicate, but _fearing_ is not a predicate,  hence is not a verb; in (3, _b_), _to go_ is no predicate, and not a  verb; in (3, _c_), _to pretend_ and _preying_ have something of  verbal nature in expressing action in a faint and general way, but  cannot be predicates.    In the sentence, \"_Put_ money in thy purse,\" _put_ is the predicate,  with some word understood; as, \"Put _thou_ money in thy purse.\"        VERBS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO MEANING AND USE.    TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS.      [Sidenote: _The nature of the transitive verb._]    202. By examining a few verbs, it may be seen that not all verbs are  used alike. All do not express action: some denote state or condition.  Of those expressing action, all do not express it in the same way; for  example, in this sentence from Bulwer,--\"The proud lone _took_ care to  conceal the anguish she _endured_; and the pride of woman _has_ an  hypocrisy which _can deceive_ the most penetrating, and _shame_ the  most astute,\"--every one of the verbs in Italics has one or more words  before or after it, representing something which it influences or  controls. In the first, lone _took_ what? answer, _care_; _endured_  what? _anguish_; etc. Each influences some object, which may be a  person, or a material thing, or an idea. _Has_ takes the object  _hypocrisy_; _can deceive_ has an object, _the most penetrating_;  (can) _shame_ also has an object, _the most astute_.    In each case, the word following, or the object, is necessary to the  completion of the action expressed in the verb.    All these are called transitive verbs, from the Latin _transire_,  which means _to go over_. Hence      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    203. A transitive verb is one which must have an object to complete  its meaning, and to receive the action expressed.    [Sidenote: _The nature of intransitive verbs._]    204. Examine the verbs in the following paragraph:--         She _sprang up_ at that thought, and, taking the staff which       always guided her steps, she _hastened_ to the neighboring shrine       of Isis. Till she _had been_ under the guardianship of the kindly       Greek, that staff _had sufficed_ to conduct the poor blind girl       from corner to corner of Pompeii.--BULWER    In this there are some verbs unlike those that have been examined.  _Sprang_, or _sprang up_, expresses action, but it is complete in  itself, does not affect an object; _hastened_ is similar in use; _had  been_ expresses condition, or state of being, and can have no object;  _had sufficed_ means _had been sufficient_, and from its meaning  cannot have an object.    Such verbs are called intransitive (not crossing over). Hence    [Sidenote: _Definition._]    205. An intransitive verb is one which is complete in itself, or  which is completed by other words without requiring an object.      [Sidenote: _Study_ use, _not_ form, _of verbs here._]    206. Many verbs can be either transitive or intransitive, according to  their use in the sentence, It can be said, \"The boy _walked_ for two  hours,\" or \"The boy _walked_ the horse;\" \"The rains _swelled_ the  river,\" or \"The river _swelled_ because of the rain;\" etc.    The important thing to observe is, many words must be distinguished as  transitive or intransitive by _use_, not by _form_.      207. Also verbs are sometimes made transitive by prepositions.  These may be (1) compounded with the verb; or (2) may follow the verb,  and be used as an integral part of it: for example,--         Asking her pardon for having _withstood_ her.--SCOTT.         I can wish myself no worse than to have it all to _undergo_ a       second time.--KINGSLEY.         A weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes, as of a child that       has _outgrown_ its playthings.--HAWTHORNE.         It is amusing to walk up and down the pier and _look at_ the       countenances passing by.--B. TAYLOR.         He was at once so out of the way, and yet so sensible, that I       loved, _laughed at_, and pitied him.--GOLDSMITH.

Loading their guns as they came the blacks ran to succor their  fellow, and at Usanga's command they spread into a thin line that  presently entirely surrounded the tree into which their comrade  had vanished.    Usanga called but received no reply; then he advanced slowly with  rifle at the ready, peering up into the tree. He could see no  one--nothing. The circle closed in until fifty blacks were searching  among the branches with their keen eyes. What had become of their  fellow? They had seen him rise into the tree and since then many  eyes had been fastened upon the spot, yet there was no sign of him.  One, more venturesome than his fellows, volunteered to climb into  the tree and investigate. He was gone but a minute or two and  when he dropped to earth again he swore that there was no sign of  a creature there.    Perplexed, and by this time a bit awed, the blacks drew slowly  away from the spot and with many backward glances and less laughing  continued upon their journey until, when about a mile beyond the  spot at which their fellow had disappeared, those in the lead saw  him peering from behind a tree at one side of the trail just in  front of them. With shouts to their companions that he had been  found they ran forwards; but those who were first to reach the  tree stopped suddenly and shrank back, their eyes rolling fearfully  first in one direction and then in another as though they expected  some nameless horror to leap out upon them.    Nor was their terror without foundation. Impaled upon the end of  a broken branch the head of their companion was propped behind the  tree so that it appeared to be looking out at them from the opposite  side of the bole.    It was then that many wished to turn back, arguing that they  had offended some demon of the wood upon whose preserve they had  trespassed; but Usanga refused to listen to them, assuring them  that inevitable torture and death awaited them should they return  and fall again into the hands of their cruel German masters. At  last his reasoning prevailed to the end that a much-subdued and  terrified band moved in a compact mass, like a drove of sheep,  forward through the valley and there were no stragglers.    It is a happy characteristic of the Negro race, which they hold  in common with little children, that their spirits seldom remain  depressed for a considerable length of time after the immediate  cause of depression is removed, and so it was that in half an hour  Usanga's band was again beginning to take on to some extent its  former appearance of carefree lightheartedness. Thus were the heavy  clouds of fear slowly dissipating when a turn in the trail brought  them suddenly upon the headless body of their erstwhile companion  lying directly in their path, and they were again plunged into the  depth of fear and gloomy forebodings.    So utterly inexplicable and uncanny had the entire occurrence been  that there was not a one of them who could find a ray of comfort  penetrating the dead blackness of its ominous portent. What had  happened to one of their number each conceived as being a wholly  possible fate for himself--in fact quite his probable fate. If such  a thing could happen in broad daylight what frightful thing might  not fall to their lot when night had enshrouded them in her mantle  of darkness. They trembled in anticipation.    The white girl in their midst was no less mystified than they; but  far less moved, since sudden death was the most merciful fate to  which she might now look forward. So far she had been subjected  to nothing worse than the petty cruelties of the women, while, on  the other hand, it had alone been the presence of the women that  had saved her from worse treatment at the hands of some of the  men--notably the brutal, black sergeant, Usanga. His own woman  was of the party--a veritable giantess, a virago of the first  magnitude--and she was evidently the only thing in the world of  which Usanga stood in awe. Even though she was particularly cruel  to the young woman, the latter believed that she was her sole  protection from the degraded black tyrant.    Late in the afternoon the band came upon a small palisaded village  of thatched huts set in a clearing in the jungle close beside  a placid river. At their approach the villagers came pouring out,  and Usanga advanced with two of his warriors to palaver with the  chief. The experiences of the day had so shaken the nerves of the  black sergeant that he was ready to treat with these people rather  than take their village by force of arms, as would ordinarily have  been his preference; but now a vague conviction influenced him  that there watched over this part of the jungle a powerful demon  who wielded miraculous power for evil against those who offended  him. First Usanga would learn how these villagers stood with this  savage god and if they had his good will Usanga would be most  careful to treat them with kindness and respect.    At the palaver it developed that the village chief had food,  goats, and fowl which he would be glad to dispose of for a proper  consideration; but as the consideration would have meant parting  with precious rifles and ammunition, or the very clothing from their  backs, Usanga began to see that after all it might be forced upon  him to wage war to obtain food.    A happy solution was arrived at by a suggestion of one of his  men--that the soldiers go forth the following day and hunt for the  villagers, bringing them in so much fresh meat in return for their  hospitality. This the chief agreed to, stipulating the kind and  quantity of game to be paid in return for flour, goats, and fowl,  and a certain number of huts that were to be turned over to the  visitors. The details having been settled after an hour or more  of that bickering argument of which the native African is so fond,  the newcomers entered the village where they were assigned to huts.    Bertha Kircher found herself alone in a small hut close to the palisade  at the far end of the village street, and though she was neither  bound nor guarded, she was assured by Usanga that she could not  escape the village without running into almost certain death in the  jungle, which the villagers assured them was infested by lions of  great size and ferocity. \"Be good to Usanga,\" he concluded, \"and  no harm will befall you. I will come again to see you after the  others are asleep. Let us be friends.\"    As the brute left her the girl's frame was racked by a convulsive  shudder as she sank to the floor of the hut and covered her face  with her hands. She realized now why the women had not been left  to guard her. It was the work of the cunning Usanga, but would not  his woman suspect something of his intentions? She was no fool and,  further, being imbued with insane jealousy she was ever looking  for some overt act upon the part of her ebon lord. Bertha Kircher  felt that only she might save her and that she would save her if  word could be but gotten to her. But how?    Left alone and away from the eyes of her captors for the first time  since the previous night, the girl immediately took advantage of  the opportunity to assure herself that the papers she had taken  from the body of Hauptmann Fritz Schneider were still safely sewn  inside one of her undergarments.    Alas! Of what value could they now ever be to her beloved country?  But habit and loyalty were so strong within her that she still clung  to the determined hope of eventually delivering the little packet  to her chief.    The natives seemed to have forgotten her existence--no one came  near the hut, not even to bring her food. She could hear them at  the other end of the village laughing and yelling and knew that  they were celebrating with food and native beer--knowledge which  only increased her apprehension. To be prisoner in a native village  in the very heart of an unexplored region of Central Africa--the  only white woman among a band of drunken Negroes! The very thought  appalled her.  Yet there was a slight promise in the fact that she  had so far been unmolested--the promise that they might, indeed,  have forgotten her and that soon they might become so hopelessly  drunk as to be harmless.    Darkness had fallen and still no one came. The girl wondered if  she dared venture forth in search of Naratu, Usanga's woman, for  Usanga might not forget that he had promised to return. No one was  near as she stepped out of the hut and made her way toward the part  of the village where the revelers were making merry about a fire.  As she approached she saw the villagers and their guests squatting  in a large circle about the blaze before which a half-dozen naked  warriors leaped and bent and stamped in some grotesque dance.  Pots of food and gourds of drink were being passed about among  the audience. Dirty hands were plunged into the food pots and the  captured portions devoured so greedily that one might have thought  the entire community had been upon the point of starvation. The  gourds they held to their lips until the beer ran down their chins  and the vessels were wrested from them by greedy neighbors. The  drink had now begun to take noticeable effect upon most of them,  with the result that they were beginning to give themselves up to  utter and licentious abandon.    As the girl came nearer, keeping in the shadow of the huts, looking  for Naratu she was suddenly discovered by one upon the edge of the  crowd--a huge woman, who rose, shrieking, and came toward her. From  her aspect the white girl thought that the woman meant literally  to tear her to pieces. So utterly wanton and uncalled-for was the  attack that it found the girl entirely unprepared, and what would  have happened had not a warrior interfered may only be guessed.  And"]]]
