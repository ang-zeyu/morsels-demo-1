One man gave four fowls, three large baskets of maize,  pumpkins, eland's fat--a fine male, as seen by his horns,--and pressed  us to stay, that he might see our curiosities as well as others. He  said that at one day's distance south of him all sorts of animals, as  buffaloes, elands, elephants, hippopotami, and antelopes, could be  shot.    _8th August, 1866._--We came to the Lake at the confluence of the  Misinje, and felt grateful to That Hand which had protected us thus  far on our journey. It was as if I had come back to an old home I  never expected again to see; and pleasant to bathe in the delicious  waters again, hear the roar of the sea, and dash in the rollers. Temp.  71 deg. at 8 A.M., while the air was 65 deg. I feel quite exhilarated.    The headman here, Mokalaose, is a real Manganja, and he and all his  people exhibit the greater darkness of colour consequent on being in a  warm moist climate; he is very friendly, and presented millet,  porridge, cassava, and hippopotamus meat boiled and asked if I liked  milk, as he had some of Mataka's cattle here. His people bring sanjika  the best Lake fish, for sale; they are dried on stages over slow  fires, and lose their fine flavour by it, but they are much prized  inland. I bought fifty for a fathom of calico; when fresh, they taste  exactly like the best herrings, _i.e._ as we think, but voyagers' and  travellers' appetites are often so whetted as to be incapable of  giving a true verdict in matters of taste.    [It is necessary to explain that Livingstone knew of an Arab  settlement on the western shore of the Lake, and that he hoped to  induce the chief man Jumbe to give him a passage to the other side.]    _10th August, 1866._--I sent Seyed Majid's letter up to Jumbe, but the  messenger met some coast Arabs at the Loangwa, which may be seven  miles from this, and they came back with him, haggling a deal about  the fare, and then went off, saying that they would bring the dhow  here for us. Finding that they did not come, I sent Musa, who brought  back word that they had taken the dhow away over to Jumbe at Kotakota,  or, as they pronounce it, Ngotagota. Very few of the coast Arabs can  read; in words they are very polite, but truthfulness seems very  little regarded. I am resting myself and people--working up journal,  lunars, and altitudes--but will either move south or go to the Arabs  towards the north soon.    Mokalaose's fears of the Waiyau will make him welcome Jumbe here, and  then the Arab will some day have an opportunity of scattering his  people as he has done those at Kotakota. He has made Losewa too hot  for himself. When the people there were carried off by Mataka's  people, Jumbe seized their stores of grain, and now has no post to  which he can go there. The Loangwa Arabs give an awful account of  Jumbe's murders and selling the people, but one cannot take it all in;  at the mildest it must have been bad. This is all they ever do; they  cannot form a state or independent kingdom: slavery and the  slave-trade are insuperable obstacles to any permanence inland; slaves  can escape so easily, all therefore that the Arabs do is to collect as  much money as they can by hook and by crook, and then leave the  country.    We notice a bird called namtambwe, which sings very nicely with a  strong voice after dark here at the Misinje confluence.    _11th August, 1866._--Two headmen came down country from villages  where we slept, bringing us food, and asking how we are treated; they  advise our going south to Mukate's, where the Lake is narrow.    _12th-14th August, 1866._--Map making; but my energies were sorely  taxed by the lazy sepoys, and I was usually quite tired out at night.  Some men have come down from Mataka's, and report the arrival of an  Englishman with cattle for me, \"he has two eyes behind as well as two  in front:\" this is enough of news for awhile!    Mokalaose has his little afflictions, and he tells me of them. A wife  ran away, I asked how many he had; he told me twenty in all: I then  thought he had nineteen too many. He answered with the usual reason,  \"But who would cook for strangers if I had but one?\"    We saw clouds of \"kungu\" gnats on the Lake; they are not eaten here.  An ungenerous traveller coming here with my statement in his hand,  and finding the people denying all knowledge of how to catch and cook  them, might say that I had been romancing in saying I had seen them  made into cakes in the northern part of the Lake; when asking here  about them, a stranger said, \"They know how to use them in the north;  we do not.\"    Mokalaose thinks that the Arabs are afraid that I may take their dhows  from them and go up to the north. He and the other headmen think that  the best way will be to go to Mukate's in the south. All the Arabs  flee from me, the English name being in their minds inseparably  connected with recapturing slavers: they cannot conceive that I have  any other object in view; they cannot read Seyed Majid's letter.    _21st August, 1866._--Started for the Loangwa, on the east side of the  Lake; hilly all the way, about seven miles. This river may be twenty  yards wide near its confluence; the Misinje is double that: each has  accumulated a promontory of deposit and enters the Lake near its apex.  We got a house from a Waiyau man on a bank about forty feet above the  level of Nyassa, but I could not sleep for the manoeuvres of a crowd  of the minute ants which infested it. They chirrup distinctly; they  would not allow the men to sleep either, though all were pretty tired  by the rough road up.    _22nd August, 1866._--We removed to the south side of the Loangwa,  where there are none of these little pests.    _23rd August, 1866._--Proposed to the Waiyau headman to send a canoe  over to call Jumbe, as I did not believe in the assertions of the  half-caste Arab here that he had sent for his. All the Waiyau had  helped me, and why not he? He was pleased with this, but advised  waiting till a man sent to Losewa should return.    _24th August, 1866._--A leopard took a dog out of a house next to  ours; he had bitten a man before, but not mortally. _29th August,  1866._--News come that the two dhows have come over to Losewa  (Losefa). The Mazitu had chased Jumbe up the hills: had they said, on  to an island, I might have believed them.    _30th August,1866._--The fear which the English have inspired in the  Arab slave-traders is rather inconvenient. All flee from me as if I  had the plague, and I cannot in consequence transmit letters to the  coast, or get across the Lake. They seem to think that if I get into a  dhow I will be sure to burn it. As the two dhows on the Lake are used  for nothing else but the slave-trade, their owners have no hope of my  allowing them to escape, so after we have listened to various lies as  excuses, we resolve to go southwards, and cross at the point of  departure of the Shire from the Lake. I took lunars several times on  both sides of the moon, and have written a despatch for Lord  Clarendon, besides a number of private letters.    _3rd September, 1866._--Went down to confluence of the Misinje and  came to many of the eatable insect \"kungu,\"--they are caught by a  quick motion of the hand holding a basket. We got a cake of these same  insects further down; they make a buzz like a swarm of bees, and are  probably the perfect state of some Lake insect.    I observed two beaches of the Lake: one about fifteen feet above the  present high-water mark, and the other about forty above that; but  between the two the process of disintegration, which results from the  sudden cold and heat in these regions, has gone on so much that seldom  is a well-rounded smoothed one seen; the lower beach is very well  marked.    The strike of large masses of foliated gneiss is parallel with the  major axis of the Lake, and all are tilted on edge. Some are a little  inclined to the Lake, as if dipping to it westwards, but others are as  much inclined the opposite way, or twisted.    I made very good blue ink from the juice of a berry, the fruit of a  creeper, which is the colour of port wine when expressed. A little  ferri carb. ammon., added to this is all that is required.    The poodle dog Chitane is rapidly changing the colour of its hair. All  the parts corresponding to the ribs and neck are rapidly becoming red;  the majority of country dogs are of this colour.    The Manganja, or Wa-nyassa, are an aboriginal race; they have great  masses of hair, and but little, if any, of the prognathous in the  profile. Their bodies and limbs are very well made, and the  countenance of the men is often very pleasant. The women are very  plain and lumpy, but exceedingly industrious in their gardens from  early morning till about 11 A.M., then from 3 P.M. till dark, or  pounding corn and grinding it: the men make twine or nets by day, and  are at their fisheries in the evenings and nights. They build the  huts, the women plaster them.    A black fish, the Nsaka, makes a hole, with raised edges, which, with  the depth from which they are taken, is from fifteen to eighteen  inches, and from two to three feet broad. It is called by the natives  their house. The pair live in it for some time, or until the female  becomes large for spawning; this operation over, the house is left.    I gave Mokalaose some pumpkin seed and peas. He took me into his  house, and presented a quantity of beer. I drank a little, and seeing  me desist from taking more, he asked if I wished a servant-girl to  \"_pata mimba_.\" Not knowing what was meant, I offered the girl the  calabash of beer, and told her to drink, but this was not the  intention. He asked if I did not wish more; and then took the vessel,  and as he drank the girl performed the operation on himself. Placing  herself in front, she put both hands round his waist below the short  ribs, and pressing gradually drew them round to his belly in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#20)"],[1," England.  Of these, Guy, lord of Cognac, became proprietor of many estates.  William, called from the Cistercian abbey in which he was born William  of Valence, secured, with the hand of Joan of Munchensi, a claim to the  great inheritance that was soon to be scattered by the extinction of  the male line of the house of Marshal. Aymer of Valence, a very  unclerical churchman, obtained in 1250 his election as bishop of  Winchester, though his youth and the hostility of his chapter delayed  his consecration for ten years. Alice their sister found a husband of  high rank in the young John of Warenne, Earl of Warenne or Surrey,  while a daughter of Hugh XI. married Robert of Ferrars, Earl of Ferrars  or Derby. Others of their kindred flocked to the land of promise. Any  Poitevin was welcome, even if not a member of the house of Lusignan.  Thus the noble adventurer John du Plessis, came over to England,  married the heiress of the Neufbourg Earls of Warwick, and in 1247 was  created Earl of Warwick. The alien invasion took a newer and more  grievous shape.    The expenses of the war were still to be paid; and in 1244 Henry  assembled a council, declaring that, as he had gone to Gascony on the  advice of his barons, they were bound to make him a liberal grant  towards freeing him from the debts which he had incurred beyond sea.  Prelates, earls, and barons each deliberated apart, and a joint  committee, composed of four members of each order, drew up an  uncompromising reply. The king had not observed the charters; previous  grants had been misapplied, and the abeyance of the great offices of  state made justice difficult and good administration impossible. The  committee insisted that a justiciar, a chancellor, and a treasurer  should forthwith be appointed. This was the last thing that the jealous  king desired. Helpless against a united council, he strove to break up  the solidarity between its lay and clerical elements by laying a papal  order before the prelates to furnish him an adequate subsidy. The leader  of the bishops was now Grosseteste, who from this time until his death  in 1253 was the pillar of the opposition. \"We must not,\" he declared,  \"be divided from the common counsel, for it is written that if we be  divided we shall all die forthwith.\" At last a committee of twelve  magnates was appointed to draw up a plan of reform. The unanimity of all  orders was shown by the co-operation on this body of prelates such as  Boniface of Savoy with patriots of the stamp of Grosseteste and Walter  of Cantilupe, while among the secular lords, Richard of Cornwall and  'Simon of Leicester worked together with baronial leaders like Norfolk  and Richard of Montfichet, a survivor of the twenty-five executors of  Magna Carta. The obstinacy of the king may well have driven the estates  into drawing up the remarkable paper constitution preserved for us by  Matthew Paris.[1] By it the execution of the charters and the  supervision of the administration were to be entrusted to four  councillors, chosen from among the magnates, and irremovable except with  their consent. It is unlikely that the scheme was ever carried out; but  its conception shows an advance in the claims of the opposition, and  anticipates the policy of restraining an incompetent ruler by a  committee responsible to the estates, which, for the next two centuries,  was the popular specific for royal maladministration. For the moment  neither side gained a decided victory. Though the barons persisted in  their refusal of an extraordinary grant, they agreed to pay an aid to  marry the king's eldest daughter to the son of Frederick II.        [1] _Chron. Maj_., iv., 366-68.    Further demands arose from the quarrel between Innocent IV.' and the  emperor. A new papal envoy, Master Martin, came to England to extort  from the clergy money to enable Innocent to carry on his war against  Frederick. The lords told Martin that if he did not quit the realm  forthwith he would be torn in pieces. In terror he prayed for a safe  conduct. \"May the devil give you a safe conduct to hell,\" was the only  reply that the angry Henry vouchsafed. Even his complaisance was  exhausted by Master Martin.    On July 26, 1245, a few weeks before Martin's expulsion, Innocent IV.  opened a general council at Lyons, in which Frederick was deposed from  the imperial dignity. Grosseteste, the chief English prelate to attend  the gathering, was drawn in conflicting directions by his zeal for pope  against emperor and by his dislike of curialist exactions. This  attitude of the bishop is reflected in the remonstrance, in the name of  the English people, laid before Innocent, declaring the faithfulness of  England to the Holy See and the wrongs with which her fidelity had been  requited. The increasing demands for money, the intrusion of aliens  into English cures, and Martin's exactions were set forth at length.  Innocent refused to entertain the petition, forced all the bishops at  Lyons to join in the deprivation of the emperor, and required every  English bishop to seal with his own seal the document by which John had  pledged the nation to a yearly tribute. No one could venture to stand  up against the successor of St. Peter, and so, despite futile  remonstrance, Innocent still had it all his own way. In 1250  Grosseteste again met Innocent face to face at Lyons, and urged him to  \"put to flight the evils and purge the abominations\" which the Roman  see had done so much to foster. But this outspoken declaration was  equally without result. Bold as were Grosseteste's words, he fully  accepted the curialist theory which regarded the pope as the universal  bishop, the divinely appointed source of all ecclesiastical  jurisdiction. He could therefore do no more than protest. If the pope  chose to disregard him, there was nothing to be done but wait patiently  for better times. The plague of foreign ecclesiastics was still to  torment the English Church for many a year.    The king's difficulties were increased by fresh troubles in Scotland  and Wales. The friendship between Henry and his brother-in-law,  Alexander II., was weakened by the death of the Queen of Scots and by  Alexander's marriage to a French lady in 1239. At last, in 1244,  relations were so threatening that the English levies were mustered for  a campaign at Newcastle. However, on the mediation of Richard of  Cornwall, Alexander bound himself not to make alliances with England's  enemies, and the trouble passed away. In Wales the difficulties were  more complicated. Llewelyn ap Iorwerth died in 1240, full of years and  honour. In the last years of his reign broken health and the revolts of  his eldest son Griffith made the old chieftain anxious for peace with  England, as the best way of securing the succession to all his  dominions of David, his son by Joan of Anjou. Henry III., anxious that  David as his nephew should inherit the principality, granted a  temporary cessation of hostilities. After Llewelyn's death David was  accepted as Prince of Snowdon, and made his way to Gloucester, where he  performed homage, and was dubbed knight by his uncle. Next year,  however, hostilities broke out, and Henry, disgusted with his nephew,  made a treaty with the wife of Griffith, Griffith himself being David's  prisoner. In 1241 Henry led an expedition from Chester into North  Wales, and forced David to submit. He surrendered Griffith to his  uncle's safe keeping and promised to yield his principality to Henry if  he died without a son. Three years later Griffith broke his neck in an  attempt to escape from the Tower. The death of his rival emboldened  David to take up a stronger line against his uncle. A fresh Welsh  expedition was necessary for the summer of 1245, in which the English  advanced to the Conway, but were speedily forced to retire. David held  his own until his death, without issue, in March, 1246, threw open the  question of the Welsh succession.          CHAPTER IV.    POLITICAL RETROGRESSION AND NATIONAL PROGRESS.      The ten years from 1248 to 1258 saw the continuance of the  misgovernment, discontent, and futile opposition which have already  been sufficiently illustrated. The history of those years must be  sought not so much in the relations of the king and his English  subjects as in Gascony, in Wales, in the crusading revival, and in the  culmination of the struggle of papacy and empire. In each of these  fields the course of events reacted sharply upon the domestic affairs  of England, until at last the failures of Henry's foreign policy gave  unity and determination to the party of opposition whose first  organised success, in 1258, ushered in the Barons' War.    The relations between England and France remained anomalous. Formal  peace was impossible, since France would yield nothing, and the English  king still claimed Normandy and Aquitaine. Yet neither Henry nor Louis  had any wish for war. They had married sisters: they were personally  friendly, and were both lovers of peace. In such circumstances it was  not hard to arrange truces from time to time, so that from 1243 to the  end of the reign there were no open hostilities. In 1248 the friendly  feeling of the two courts was particularly strong. Louis was on the eve  of departure for the crusade and many English nobles had taken the  cross. Henry, who was himself contemplating a crusade, was of no mind  to avail himself of his kinsman's absence to disturb his realm.    The French could afford to pass over Henry's neglect to do homage, for  Gascony seemed likely to emancipate itself from the yoke of its English  dukes without any prompting from Paris. After the failure of 1243, a  limited amount of territory between the Dordogne and the Pyrenees alone  acknowledged Henry. This narrower Gascony was a thoroughly feudalised  land: the absentee dukes had little authority, domain, or revenue: and  the chief lordships were held by magnates, whose relations "]]]
