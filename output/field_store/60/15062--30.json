Dry half a pound of good brown sugar, pound it and mix it with two  pounds of flour, and sift it; add two spoonsful of yeast, and as much  new milk as will make it like bread: when well risen, knead in half a  pound of butter, make it in cakes the size of a half dollar, and fry  them a light brown in boiling lard.           *       *       *       *       *    RISEN CAKE.

In my own case, a dysentery  followed the fever, and reduced me to a mere skeleton. The dry belly-ache  is another dangerous disease, accompanied by general languor, a decrease of  appetite, a viscous expectoration, and fixed pain in the stomach. Opium is  considered an efficacious medicine in this disease, and is administered  with great perseverance, accompanied by frequent fomentations. An infusion  of ginger drank in the morning has frequently good effects. Flannel assists  excretion, and is found beneficial. _Tetanos_ is also another disease  peculiar to Africa, and is a kind of spasm and convulsive contraction, for  which opium is the usual remedy.    The Guinea worm is another disease among the natives, which is productive  of tumours upon the body and limbs, productive of great pain, and is a  contagious disease. This, however, is a subject without my province, and  which has been ably treated upon by gentlemen, whose profession fully  qualified them for the investigation. In addition to the many valuable  treatises upon tropical diseases, from high authority, I would recommend  Dr. Winterbottom's publication to the reader, as, embracing highly  important local information upon the diseases of the Windward Coast.    I have only touched on those which have more immediately come within my  personal observation. Too much care cannot be taken by Europeans in  drinking, and even washing in the waters of Africa, which should always  undergo a filtering preparation, and I am persuaded that great  circumspection should be used in this respect: these and other precautions,  with a generous, but regular system of living, would no doubt tend to  diminish the fatal tendency of diseases in Africa.    Without doubt, a series of professional observations and enquiry into the  temperature and periodical variations of the climate of Africa, and its  diseases, would be attended with the most important advantages to the  science of physic, and might ultimately prove of incalculable consequence  in preserving the valuable lives of our brave soldiers and sailors, exposed  to all the ravages of tropical climates. Advantages that are well worth the  attention of government, which would train up a body of physicians and  surgeons, initiated into the mysteries of the diseases peculiar to those  countries, which might tend to preserve a large portion of human beings of  the utmost consequence and importance to the state; and it might form a  part in the organization of colonial establishments, to attach thereto an  institution of this nature.        CHAPTER X.          _The Author visits the Isles de Loss.--Remarks on those Islands.--Touches  at the River Scarcies.--Arrives at the Colony of Sierra Leone.--Embarks for  the West Indies--Lands at the Colony of Demerory.--Some Observations on the  Productions of that Colony, Berbice, and Essequibo, and on the Importance  of Dutch Guiana to the United Kingdom, in a political and commercial View._      On the 4th of July, I rejoined the Minerva at the Palm Trees, and on the  5th we weighed and passed the bar of the Rio Pongo, steering our course for  the Isles de Loss; and on the 6th came to an anchor off Factory Island.    The Isles de Loss, in the Portuguese language meaning Islands of Idols, are  so called from the idolatrous customs of the natives, and are seven in  number; Tammara, Crawford's, Factory, Temba, White's, Goat, and Kid  islands. Tammara is the largest, but very difficult of approach, and has  few inhabitants; Crawford's has two factories for trade, belonging to  gentlemen formerly in the service of the Sierra Leone Company; and Factory  Island has an American establishment, conducted by a Mr. Fisk, These are  the principal (the others being little more than barren rocks), and they  abound in vegetation and natural productions. Squilly, or the sea onion, to  which great medicinal qualities are ascribed, grows in great abundance in  these islands, and might be procured in almost any quantity. Dr. Lewis, in  the _Materia Medica_, or _Edinburgh Dispensary_, describes the peculiar  qualities of this root.    The positions of these islands are excellent for trade, but exposed to the  predatory excursions of the enemy, who have frequently pillaged the  factories established in Crawford's Island.    On the 9th we again got under weigh, steering our course for the entrance  into the river Scarcies. The night was attended by tremendous peals of  thunder, lightning, and torrents of rain: we continued off and on until the  12th, when we arrived outside Mattacont Island, bearing E. by S. and the  Isles de Loss in sight. At 2 P.M. I accompanied Captain Brown, with five  hands, in the pinnace, with the intention of running into the Scarcies  river. We sailed with a fresh breeze in expectation of gaining the entrance  by the approach of night; but we were obliged to anchor in the open sea,  amidst the most awful peals of thunder, while the whole heaven displayed  nothing but vivid flashes of lightning. Amidst this tremendous scene,  exposed to the mercy of the waves, with the prospect of being deluged by  rain, we secured our little bark and ourselves, in the best manner our  circumstances would admit, and committed ourselves to the all protecting  care and disposal of Providence. The mantle of night was soon spread around  us, the scene was grand and solemn, and we were at length hushed to rest by  the jar of elements, and the murmurs of the ocean. We awoke to contemplate  an azure sky, and the all-bountiful mercy of the Creator, in preserving us  from such imminent danger, to pursue our destination through breakers,  shoals, and sands.    At day-light, with a breeze from the land, we weighed, and steered our  course S.S.E. for the Scarcies bar, but the wind shifting to the S.E. and  the ebb tide running strong, we were nearly driven out of sight of land; we  were therefore obliged again to anchor, and wait the change of tide.  Trusting to a sea breeze that had just set in, it being slack water, we  again weighed: the serenity of the weather did not long continue, but soon  increased to a brisk gale, accompanied by thunder, lightning and rain; we  were driven with great impetuosity through the narrow channel between the  bar and the shore, and from the shallowness of the water, the rollers  continually broke over our heads, threatening our destruction every moment.  Providentially we surmounted these dangers, and at 5 P.M. entered the  river, which is interspersed with islands and picturesque objects, that  could not be viewed without interest. I have been thus minute in describing  this excursive voyage, that others, whose business may hereafter lead them  to this river, may profit by the difficulties we experienced in this  critical and dangerous passage. We were obliged to come to an anchorage in  the river during the night, under a very violent rain, and the next day  arrived at Robart, the factory of Mr. Aspinwall.    This gentleman, whom a previous acquaintance had induced me to visit,  received us with great hospitality and kindness. From a residence of  upwards of 32 years on the coast, he possesses much intelligence and  valuable information relative to this part of Africa, and I am indebted to  him not only on this, but on former occasions, for many interesting  particulars.    The factories of trade in this river are,         Mr. Aspinwall,      Robart.   Boatswain,          A black chief and trader, above Robart.   Mr. Lewis,          Rocoopa, attached to Bance Island.   Mr. Gordon,         Thomas's Island, ditto.        With a variety of small factories attached to those of Mr. Aspinwall.    On the 15th we took leave of Mr. Aspinwall, and embarked on board a  schooner he had the kindness to furnish us with; and after a very tedious  and tempestuous passage, arrived at Sierra Leone on the 21st, having had  contrary winds to contend with; whereas with a favourable breeze, the  passage is usually performed in a few hours.    Here I was attacked with the epidemic fever of Africa, and experienced the  medical assistance and friendship I have previously noticed.    In an exceedingly exhausted state, but much recovered, I again embarked on  board the Minerva, where I had a second attack of the fever, accompanied by  dysentery, which reduced me to the lowest state of existence; and after one  of the most distressing and disagreeable voyages I ever experienced, we  arrived in Demerary roads after a passage of 71 days, and, by the  providence of the Almighty, we escaped both disease and the enemy.    A few hours after we came to an anchor I went on shore, and I verily  believe that the passengers and spectators suspected they had received a  visitation from the world of spirits. When I reached the house of Mr. Colin  McCrea, Captain Brown's consignee, the unaffected and gentlemanlike  reception I met with, both from him and his lady, with their subsequent  kind conduct, can never be effaced from my memory. Captain Brown soon  joined us, and in the most engaging terms we were invited to become inmates  with Mr. McCrea and his partner, which we availed ourselves of during our  stay in Demerary. A few days after, I became acquainted with Mr. Alexander  McCrea, brother to my kind host, and as soon as my health would permit,  visited him at his plantation, the Hope, 11 miles from Stabroke, the  capital of the colony of Demerary. In this society, and from other  quarters, I was favoured with various information upon the situation of the  colonies in Dutch Guiana, and their importance in a political and  commercial point of view.    The colonial produce of Demerary, Essequibo, and Berbice, chiefly consists  in sugar, coffee, cotton, rum, and molasses; but the richness and fertility  of the soil is capable of raising any tropical production; new sources  being daily unfolded, of the"]]]
