A yellow precipitate was then thrown down, as you perceive  is the case now; and this, carefully washed and cleansed, gave us that  body [pointing to a specimen of the chloride of platinum and ammonium],  the other elements, or nearly all, being ejected.  This substance being  heated, gave us what we call platinum sponge, or platinum in the metallic  state, so finely divided as to form a kind of heavy mass or sponge, which,  at the time that Dr. Wollaston first sent it forth, was not fusible for  the market or in the manufacturers' workshops, inasmuch as the temperature  required was so high, and there were no furnaces that could bring the mass  into a globule, and cause the parts to adhere together. Most of our metals  that we obtain from nature, and work in our shops, are brought at last  into a mass by fusion.  I am not aware that there is in the arts or  sciences any other than iron which is not so.  Soft iron we do not bring  together by fusion, but by a process which is analogous to the one that  was followed in the case of platinum, namely, welding; for these divided  grains of spongy platinum having been well washed and sunk in water for  the purpose of excluding air, and pressed together, and heated, and  hammered, and pressed again, until they come into a pretty close, dense,  compact mass, did so cohere, that when the mass was put into the furnace  of charcoal, and raised to a high temperature, the particles, at first  infinitely divided--for they were chemically divided--adhered the one to  the other, each to all the rest, until they made that kind of substance  which you see here, which will bear rolling and expansion of every kind.  No other process than that has hitherto been adopted for the purpose of  obtaining this substance from the particles by solution, precipitation,  ignition, and welding. It certainly is a very fine thing to see that we  may so fully depend upon the properties of the various substances we have  to deal with; that we can, by carrying out our processes, obtain a  material like this, allowing of division and extension under a rolling  mill--a material of the finest possible kind, the parts being held  together, not with interstices, not with porosity, but so continuous that  no fluids can pass between them; and, as Dr. Wollaston beautifully shewed,  a globule of platinum fused by the voltaic battery and the oxy-hydrogen  blowpipe, when drawn into a wire, was not sounder or stronger than this  wire made by the curious coalescence of the particles by the sticking  power that they had at high temperatures. This is the process adopted by  Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, to whose great kindness I am indebted for  these ingots and for the valuable assistance I have received in the  illustrations.    The treatment, however, that I have to bring before you is of another  kind; and it is in the hope that we shall be able before long to have such  a thing as the manufacture of platinum of this kind, that I am encouraged  to come before you, and tell you how far Deville has gone in the matter,  and to give you illustrations of the principles on which he proceeds. I  think it is but fair that you should see an experiment shewing you the way  in which we get the adhesion of platinum. Probably you all know of the  welding of iron: you go into the smith's shop, and you see him put the  handle of a poker on to the stem, and by a little management and the  application of heat he makes them one.  You have no doubt seen him put the  iron into the fire and sprinkle a little sand upon it.  He does not know  the philosophy he calls into play when he sprinkles a little sand over the  oxide of iron, but he has a fine philosophy there, or practises it, when  he gets his welding. I can shew you here this beautiful circumstance of  the sticking together of the particles up to the fullest possible  intensity of their combination. If you were to go into the workshops of  Mr. Matthey, and see them hammering and welding away, you would see the  value of the experiment I am about to shew you. I have here some  platinum-wire.  This is a metal which resists the action of acids, resists  oxidation by heat, and change of any sort; and which, therefore, I may  heat in the atmosphere without any flux. I bend the wire so as to make the  ends cross: these I make hot by means of the blowpipe, and then, by giving  them a tap with a hammer, I shall make them into one piece. Now that the  pieces are united, I shall have great difficulty in pulling them apart,  though they are joined only at the point where the two cylindrical  surfaces came together. And now I have succeeded in pulling the wire  apart, the division is not at the point of welding, but where the force of  the pincers has cut it, so that the junction we have effected is a  complete one. This, then, is the principle of the manufacture and  production of platinum in the old way.    The treatment which Deville proposes to carry out, and which he has  carried out to a rather large extent in reference to the Russian supply of  platinum, is one altogether by heat, having little or no reference to the  use of acids. That you may know what the problem is, look at this table,  which gives you the composition of such a piece of platinum ore as I  shewed you just now. Wherever it comes from, the composition is as  complicated, though the proportions vary:--    Platinum, . . . . . 76.4  Iridium,. . . . . .  4.3  Rhodium,. . . . . .  0.3  Palladium,. . . . .  1.4  Gold, . . . . . . .  0.4  Copper, . . . . . .  4.1  Iron, . . . . . . . 11.7  Osmide of Iridium,.  0.5  Sand, . . . . . . .  1.4                     -----                     100.5    This refers to the Uralian ore. In that state of combination, as shewn in  the table, the iridium and osmium are found combined in crystals,  sometimes to the amount of 0.5 per cent., and sometimes 3 or 4 per cent.  Now, this Deville proposes to deal with in the dry way, in the place of  dealing with it by any acid.    I have here another kind of platinum; and I shew it to you for this  reason. The Russian Government, having large stores of platinum in their  dominions, have obtained it in a metallic state, and worked it into coin.  The coin I have in my hand is a twelve silver rouble piece. The rouble is  worth three shillings, and this coin is, therefore, of the value of  thirty-six shillings. The smaller coin is worth half that sum; and the  other, half of that. The metal, however, is unfit for coinage. When you  have the two metals, gold and silver, used for coinage, you have a little  confusion in the value of the two in the market; but when you have three  precious metals (for you may call platinum a precious metal) worked into  coin, they will be sure to run counter to one another. Indeed, the case  did happen, that the price of platinum coin fixed by the Government was  such, that it was worth while to purchase platinum in other countries, and  make coin of it, and then take it into that country and circulate it. The  result was, that the Russian Government stopped the issue. The composition  of this coin is--platinum, 97.0; iridium, 1.2; rhodium, 0.5; palladium,  0.25; a little copper, and a little iron. It is, in fact, bad platinum: it  scales, and it has an unfitness for commercial use and in the laboratory,  which the other well-purified platinum has not. It wants working over  again.    Now, Deville's process depends upon three points,--upon intense heat,  blowpipe action, and the volatility of certain metals. We know that there  are plenty of metals that are volatile; but this, I think, is the first  time that it has been proposed to use the volatility of certain  metals--such as gold and palladium--for the purpose of driving them off  and leaving something else behind. He counts largely upon the volatility  of metals which we have not been in the habit of considering volatile, but  which we have rather looked upon as fixed; and I must endeavour to  illustrate these three points by a few experiments. Perhaps I can best  show you what is required in the process of heating platinum by using that  source of heat which we have here, and which seems to be almost  illimitable--namely, the voltaic battery; for it is only in consequence of  the heat that the voltaic battery affects the platinum. By applying the  two extremities of the battery to this piece of platinum-wire, you will  see what result we shall obtain. You perceive that we can take about this  heating agent wherever we like, and deal with it as we please, limiting it  in any way. I am obliged to deal carefully with it; but even that  circumstance will have an interest for you in watching the experiment.  Contact is now made. The electric current, when compressed into thin  conducting-wires offering resistance, evolves heat to a large extent; and  this is the power by which we work. You see the intense glow immediately  imparted to the wire; and if I applied the heat continuously, the effect  of the current would be to melt the wire. As soon as the contact is  broken, the wire resumes its former appearance; and now that we make  contact again, you perceive the glow as before. [The experiment was  repeated several times in rapid succession.] You can see a line of light,  though you can scarcely perceive the wire; and now that it has melted with  the great heat, if you examine it, you will perceive that it is indeed a  set of irregularities from end to end--a set of little spheres, which are  strung upon an axis of platinum running through it. It is that wire which  Mr. Grove described as being produced at the moment when fusion of the  whole mass is commencing. In the same manner, if I take a tolerably thick  piece of platinum, and subject it to the heat that can be produced by this  battery, you will see the brilliancy of the effect produced. I shall put  on a pair of spectacles for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],[0,"The Religions of India (#20)"],[1,"na, Dyaus, etc., are of  more recent growth in dignity, yet there remains a considerable number  of divinities, the hymns in whose honor, dating from the latest  period, seem to show that the power they celebrate had been but lately  admitted into the category of those gods that deserved special  worship. Consequently new gods would be a misleading term,  as it should be applied to the plainer products of theological  speculation and abstraction rather than to Indra and his peers, not to  speak of those newest pantheistic gods, as yet unknown. The  designation popular must be understood, then, to apply to the gods  most frequently, most enthusiastically revered (for in a stricter  sense the sun was also a popular god); and reference is had in using  this word to the greater power and influence of these gods, which is  indicated by the fact that the hymns to Agni and Indra precede all  others in the family books, while the Soma-hymns are collected for the  most part into one whole book by themselves.    But there is another factor that necessitates a division between the  divinities of sun and heaven and the atmospheric and earthly gods  which are honored so greatly; and this factor is explanatory of the  popularity of these gods. In the case of the older divinities it is  the spiritualization of a sole material appearance that is revered; in  the case of the popular gods, the material phenomenon is reduced to a  minimum, the spirituality behind the phenomenon is exalted, and that  spirituality stands not in and for itself, but as a part of a union of  spiritualities. Applying this test to the earlier gods the union will  be found to be lacking. The sun's spiritual power is united with  Indra's, but the sun is as much a physical phenomenon as a  spirituality, and always remains so. On the other hand, the equation  of Varunic power with Indraic never amalgamated the two; and these are  the best instances that can be chosen of the older gods. For in the  case of others it is self-evident. Dyaus and Dawn are but material  phenomena, slightly spiritualized, but not joined with the  spirit-power of others.    Many have been the vain attempts to go behind the returns of Vedic  hymnology and reduce Indra, Agni, and Soma to terms of a purely  naturalistic religion. It cannot be done. Indra is neither sun,  lightning, nor storm; Agni is neither hearth-fire nor celestial fire;  Soma is neither planet nor moon.    Each is the transient manifestation of a spirituality lying behind and  extending beyond this manifestation. Here alone is the latch-key of  the newer, more popular religion. Not merely because Indra was a  'warrior god,' but because Indra and Fire were one; because of the  mystery, not because of the appearance, was he made great at the hands  of the priests. It is true, as has been said above, that the idol of  the warriors was magnified because he was such; but the true cause of  the greatness ascribed to him in the hymns lay in the secret of his  nature, as it was lauded by the priest, not in his form, as it was  seen by the multitude. Neither came first, both worked together; but  had it not been for the esoteric wisdom held by the priests in  connection with his nature, Indra would have gone the way of other  meteorological gods; whereas he became chiefest of the gods, and, as  lord of strength, for a time came nearest to the supreme power.      INDRA.    Indra has been identified with 'storm,' with the 'sky,' with the  'year'; also with 'sun' and with 'fire' in general.[2] But if he be  taken as he is found in the hymns, it will be noticed at once that he  is too stormy to be the sun; too luminous to be the storm; too near to  the phenomena of the monsoon to be the year or the sky; too rainy to  be fire; too alien from every one thing to be any one thing. He is too  celestial to be wholly atmospheric; too atmospheric to be celestial;  too earthly to be either. A most tempting solution is that offered by  Bergaigne, who sees in Indra sun or lightning. Yet does this  explanation not explain all, and it is more satisfactory than others  only because it is broader; while it is not yet broad enough. Indra,  in Bergaigne's opinion, stands, however, nearer to fire than to  sun.[3] But the savant does not rest content with his own explanation:  \"Indra est peut-etre, de tous les dieux vediques, celui qui resiste le  plus longtemps a un genre d'analyse qui, applique a la plupart des  autres, les resout plus ou moins vite en des personnifications des  elements, soit des phenomenes naturels, soit du culte\" (ibid. p. 167).    Dyaus' son, Indra, who rides upon the storm and hurls the lightnings  with his hands; who 'crashes down from heaven' and 'destroys the  strongholds' of heaven and earth; whose greatness 'fills heaven and  earth'; whose 'steeds are of red and gold'; who 'speaks in thunder,'  and 'is born of waters and cloud'; behind whom ride the storm-gods;  with whom Agni (fire) is inseparably connected; who 'frees the waters  of heaven from the demon,' and 'gives rain-blessings and wealth' to  man--such a god, granted the necessity of a naturalistic  interpretation, may well be thought to have been lightning itself  originally, which the hymns now represent the god as carrying. But in  identifying Indra with the sun there is more difficulty. In none of  the early hymns is this suggested, and the texts on which Bergaigne  relies besides being late are not always conclusive. \"Indra clothes  himself with the glory of the sun\"; he \"sees with the eye of the  sun\"--such texts prove little when one remembers that the sun is the  eye of all the gods, and that to clothe ones' self with solar glory is  far from being one with the sun. In one other, albeit a late verse,  the expression 'Indra, a sun,' is used; and, relying on such texts,  Bergaigne claims that Indra is the sun. But it is evident that this is  but one of many passages where Indra by implication is compared to the  sun; and comparisons do not indicate allotropy. So, in ii. II. 20,  which Bergaigne gives as a parallel, the words say expressly \"Indra  [did so and so] _like a sun_.\"[4] To rest a building so important on a  basis so frail is fortunately rare with Bergaigne. It happens here  because he is arguing from the assumption that Indra primitively was a  general luminary. Hence, instead of building up Indra from early  texts, he claims a few late phrases as precious confirmation of his  theory.[5] What was Indra may be seen by comparing a few citations  such as might easily be amplified from every book in the Rig Veda.    According to the varying fancies of the poets, Indra is armed with  stones, clubs, arrows, or the thunderbolt (made for him by the  artificer, Tvashtar), of brass or of gold, with many edges and points.  Upon a golden chariot he rides to battle, driving two or many red or  yellow steeds; he is like the sun in brilliancy, and like the dawn in  beauty; he is multiform, and cannot really be described; his divine  name is secret; in appearance he is vigorous, huge; he is wise and  true and kind; all treasures are his, and he is a wealth-holder, vast  as four seas; neither his greatness nor his generosity can be  comprehended; mightiest of gods is he, filling the universe; the  heavens rest upon his head; earth cannot hold him; earth and heaven  tremble at his breath; he is king of all; the mountains are to him as  valleys; he goes forth a bull, raging, and rushes through the air,  whirling up the dust; he breaks open the rain-containing clouds, and  lets the rain pour down; as the Acvins restore the light, so he  restores the rain; he is (like) fire born in three places; as the  giver of rain which feeds, he creates the plants; he restores or  begets Sun and Dawn (after the storm has passed);[6] he creates (in  the same way) all things, even heaven and earth; he is associated with  Vishnu and P[=u]shan (the sun-gods), with the Acvins, with the Maruts  (storm-gods) as his especial followers, and with the artisan Ribhus.  With Varuna he is an Aditya, but he is also associated with another  group of gods, the Vasus (x. 66. 3), as Vasupati, or 'lord of the  Vasus.' He goes with many forms (vi. 47. 18).[7]    The luminous character[8] of Indra, which has caused him to be  identified with light-gods, can be understood only when one remembers  that in India the rainy season is ushered in by such displays of  lightning that the heavens are often illuminated in every direction at  once; and not with a succession of flashes, but with contemporaneous  ubiquitous sheets of light, so that it appears as if on all sides of  the sky there was one lining of united dazzling flame. When it is said  that Indra 'placed light in light,' one is not to understand, with  Bergaigne, that Indra is identical with the sun, but that in day  (light) Indra puts lightning (x. 54. 6; Bergaigne ii. p. 187).    Since Indra's lightning[9] is a form of fire, there is found in this  union the first mystic dualism of two distinct gods as one. This comes  out more in Agni-worship than in Indra-worship, and will be treated  below. The snake or dragon killed by Indra is Vritra, the restrainer,  who catches and keeps in the clouds the rain that is falling to earth.  He often is called simply the snake, and as the Budhnya Snake, or  snake of the cloud-depths, is possibly the Python (=Budh-nya).[10]  There is here a touch of primitive belief in an old enemy of man--the  serpent! But the Budhnya Snake has been developed in opposite ways,  and has contradictory functions.[11]    Indra, however, is no more the lightning than he is the sun. One poet  says that he is like the sun;[12] another, that he is like the  lightning (viii. 93. 9), which he carries in his arms (viii. 12. 7);  another, that he is like the light of dawn (x. 89. 12). So various are  the activities, so many the phenomena, that with him first the seer is  obliged to look back of all these phenomena and find in them one  "]]]
