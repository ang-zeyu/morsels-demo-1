A meeting was accordingly held at Annapolis, in September, 1786;  but as commissioners from only five states attended, viz., New York, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia, the commissioners deemed  it unadvisable to proceed to business relating to an object in which all  the states were concerned; but they united in a report to the several  states and to congress, in which they recommended the calling of a  general convention of delegates from all the states, to meet in  Philadelphia on the 2d Monday of May, 1787, with a view not only to the  regulation of commerce, but to such other amendments of the articles of  confederation as were necessary to render them \"adequate to the  exigencies of the union.\"    Sec.11. In pursuance of this recommendation, congress, in February, 1787,  passed a resolution for assembling a convention. All the states, except  Rhode Island, appointed delegates, who met pursuant to appointment; and  framed the present constitution of the United States. They also  recommended it to be laid by congress before the several states, to be  by them considered and ratified in conventions of representatives of the  people. Conventions were accordingly called for this purpose in all the  states, except Rhode Island, and the constitution was ratified by all of  them in which conventions had been called, except North Carolina.    Sec.12. The constitution was to go into effect if ratified by nine states.  The ninth state, New Hampshire, sent its ratification to congress in  July, 1788; and measures were taken by congress to put the new  constitution into operation. Ratifications were received from North  Carolina and Rhode Island the year after the organization of the new  government.          Chapter XXVIII.    Nature of the Union under the Constitution.        Sec.1. Having given, in the preceding chapter, a sketch of the union under  the confederation, we shall next show the nature of the union under the  present constitution, commencing with a brief comparison of the leading  features of the two systems of government.    Sec.2. The former union was a mere confederacy. A _confederacy_ is a  league, a federal compact. The word _federal_ is from the Latin _fadus_,  a league, or alliance. Hence a confederacy is a combination or union of  two or more parties, whether persons or states, for their mutual benefit  and assistance. And let it be here particularly noted, that this union  was a union of states, _as states_. The articles of confederation were  framed by congress, whose members were appointed by the state  legislatures, and, when framed, were submitted to the state legislatures  for ratification.    Sec.3. On the other hand, the union under the constitution is a union, not  of the states, as such, but of the _people of the states_. Thus it is  expressed in the preamble to the constitution: \"We, the people of the  United States, in order to form a more perfect union, ... do ordain and  establish this constitution for the United States of America.\" And the  constitution was submitted for ratification, not to the state  legislatures, but to conventions whose members were elected by the  people for that purpose.    Sec.4. The states under the confederation were independent, not only of  each other, but of the general government. True, they agreed, for their  common defense and mutual welfare, to do certain things; and certain  other things they agreed not to do, but delegated to congress the power  to do them; but, as we have seen, congress had not the power to compel  the states to obey its requisitions. By the constitution, the states  have given up a greater portion of their sovereignty to the general  government, which has power, in certain cases, to control the state  governments, and to enforce its laws upon them and upon individuals.    Sec.5. Again, under the confederation, as in confederacies generally, the  states were equal. They were entitled to an equal number of delegates in  the congress, in which they voted by states, each state having one vote;  that is, if a majority of the delegates of a state voted in favor of or  against a proposed measure, the vote of the state was so counted; and a  proposition having in its favor a majority of the states, was carried.  Every state was entitled to seven delegates; but there must be at least  two delegates present and voting, in order to give a state vote; and if  an equal number of the delegates of a state voted for and against a  proposition, the state was said to be divided, and to have no vote.    Sec.6. Under the constitution there are two branches of congress, in one of  which the number of representatives of each state is in proportion to  its population; in the other, (the senate,) the states are equally  represented, on the principle of the confederation, though by two  senators only. But the vote in both is taken, not by states as under the  confederation, but _per capita_, that is, by the head or poll, the vote  of each member counting one.    Sec.7. The articles of confederation were framed by congress, the members  of which were appointed by the state legislatures; and the articles,  when framed, were submitted for ratification to the state legislatures.  The constitution was framed by a convention of delegates from the  states appointed for that purpose; and was ratified, not by the state  legislatures, but by state conventions whose members were elected by the  people of the several states.    Sec.8. The former union, as has been remarked, was a mere Confederacy,  composed of independent states, and united simply for purposes of  defense and their mutual safety. In most respects they had no more  political connection than so many different nations. The people of a  state were not, properly speaking, citizens of the United States, but  only citizens of the state in which they lived. But by the constitution,  the people of the states were incorporated into a nation; and a citizen  of a state is also a citizen of the United States. The government of the  confederation, although sometimes called the national government, was  not really such, nor was it generally so regarded, as appears from the  proceedings of the convention that framed the constitution.    Sec.9. Among the earliest proceedings of the convention was the offering of  a resolution, declaring that \"a national government ought to be formed,  consisting of legislative, judiciary, and executive.\" This resolution  was strongly opposed by a large portion of the delegates, because it  proposed to establish a _national_ government. They were in favor of  continuing the confederation with a slight enlargement of the powers of  congress, so as to give that body the power to lay and collect taxes,  and to regulate commerce. But the friends of a national government  prevailed; and we have now a complete government, consisting of the  three departments, legislative, executive, and judicial.    Sec.10. Under the confederation, there was no executive to execute the  ordinances of congress; nor a national judiciary, the state courts being  used for all judicial purposes. There was only a legislature; and that  consisted of a single body, called the congress, appointed by the state  legislatures, and having scarcely power enough to entitle it to the name  of legislature.    Sec.11. But, although the present government, with these three departments  of power, and controlling, in matters of general concern, the action of  the state governments and of individuals, is properly a national  government; yet it is not wholly such, but partly national and partly  federal; some of the federal features of the confederation having been  retained in the constitution, as will appear on a further examination of  this instrument. Hence the union is still called, with propriety, the  _federal union_, and the government the _federal government_.          Chapter XXIX.    Legislative Department. House of Representatives.        Sec.1. The first article of the constitution describes the manner in which  the legislature is formed, and prescribes its principal powers. It  declares, \"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a  congress of the United States, which shall consist of a senate and house  of representatives.\" Members of the old congress were appointed by the  state legislatures for one year, and might be recalled by them at any  time. Representatives are now chosen for two years. It was thought that  a single session was too short a term for men in general to acquire the  knowledge and experience necessary to a right performance of the  responsible duties of a representative. Besides, measures are often left  unfinished at the close of a session; and those who have once examined  their merits and demerits, can dispose of them more promptly than new  members.    Sec.2. The same clause declares that \"the electors in each state shall have  the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of  the state legislature.\" The qualifications of electors were various in  the different states. (Chap. VI, Sec.8.) In some of them, owners of  property, or tax-payers, in others, freeholders only, were voters. In  some, only the latter voted for the higher officers; in a few, suffrage  was almost universal. It was presumed that no state would object to its  own rule for electing the popular branch of its legislature. It is  proper that a representative should be chosen directly by those whose  wants he is to make known, and whose rights he is to guard.    Sec.3. A representative must, at the time of his election, \"have attained  the age of twenty-five years; and have been seven years a citizen of the  United States;\" and he must \"be an inhabitant of the state in which he  is chosen.\" Few young men, on attaining the age of majority, have the  knowledge, or experience, or wisdom, which is requisite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#20)"],[1,"the game-keeper. Moreover I now put a new construction  upon Hawkins' sly amusement when I had inquired about the \"shooting\"  in the neighborhood.    I began to grow keenly interested, and:    \"Surely you took some steps in the matter?\" I asked.    \"Oh, ah. My son Jim did. He lay for days for that there Gipsy  Hawkins--but Hawkins was too wise for him.\"    \"But,\" said I, \"you could legally have claimed damages.\"    \"Maybe,\" was the reply; \"but I reckon they'd have asked what my son  Jim was doing in the Park. Oh, ah, I reckon they would.\"    This point of view had not hitherto presented itself to me, but that  it was a just one I did not doubt.    \"What is the object of all this?\" I asked. \"Does Lady Coverly object  to any one entering the grounds?\"    \"'Tain't Lady Coverly,\" confided the old man; \"it's that there black  doctor.\"    \"What black doctor?\" I exclaimed.    \"Him they call Doctor Greefe.\"    \"Oh,\" said I, \"you call him the black doctor. Is he a negro?\"    \"He's black,\" was the reply, \"black he is although his hair is white.  Oh, ah, there's black blood in him all right.\"    \"And what has he to do with the man-traps in the Park?\"    \"Has 'em put there--has 'em put there, he does.\"    \"But what for? Surely the property belongs not to Dr. Greefe but to  Lady Coverly.\"    \"Belongs to her! Her own soul don't belong to her!\"    I was conscious of a growing excitement. I thought that I was about to  learn the very fact which I was seeking, and accordingly:    \"What is the age of Lady Burnham Coverly?\" I asked.    \"Lady Burnham? Well, let me see; she were not more'n about  twenty-five, I reckon, when Sir Burnham first brought her to the Park.  Them was the days, them was. These parts 'as changed cruel since I was  a young man. Then it was soon after as Sir Burnham went off to Egypt  for government, and eleven years afore he come back again.\"    \"Did Lady Burnham accompany him to Egypt?\" I asked, interestedly.    \"Oh, ah, for sure she did. Poor Mr. Roger was born in Egypt. It was  eight years come October they returned home to Park, and six years  come September poor young Mr. Roger died.\"    \"Then Lady Coverly must be something over forty years of age,\" said I  musingly.    One of my theories, a wild one, I must confess, was shattered by this  piece of information. In short I had conceived the idea (and the news  that Lady Coverly had resided for some years in Egypt had strengthened  it) that the woman in the case was none other than the mistress of  Friar's Park! Her antipathy towards the late baronet had seemed to  suggest a motive for the crime. But it was impossible to reconcile the  figure of this lonely and bereaved woman with that of the  supernormally agile visitant to my cottage in London, in short, with  the possessor of those dreadful green eyes. I determined to try a new  tack, and remembering that the real object of my journey to Upper  Crossleys was to learn particulars respecting the early death of Roger  Coverly:    \"Did Mr. Roger Coverly die in England?\" I inquired.    \"Oh, no, sir; he died in foreign parts, but they brought him home to  bury him, they did.\"    \"Do you know of what he died?\"    \"Oh, ah. I have heard tell it was some foreign fever like--took him  off sudden, and him only a lad. It killed poor Sir Burnham, it did.\"    \"Then Sir Burnham died shortly afterwards?\"    \"Two years afterwards, and these parts has never been the same since.\"    \"But what has Dr. Greefe to do with all this?\"    \"Ah, now you're asking. Seven years ago he settled here in the big  house up by the Park; part of the Park estate it is; and there he's  been ever since, him and his black servant.\"    \"Black servant!\" I exclaimed.    \"Oh, ah, real black he is--not half-and-half like his master, but as  black as a lump o' coal, an' ugly--oh, ah, he's ugly right enough.  Goes up to the Abbey Inn of a night he do, him and that there Gipsy  Hawkins, the prettiest pair o' rascals in Upper Crossleys. Drove all  the decent folk away from the place, and Martin keeps the best beer  about here, too. If I was Martin,\" continued the ancient, truculently,  \"I'd know what to say to them two, I would; aye, and what to do to  'em,\" he added with great ferocity.    \"Oh,\" said I; for this unexpected clearing up of so many minor  mysteries had rather taken me aback. \"Then Dr. Greefe is not popular?\"    \"Popular!\" echoed the old man.    He drained his tankard and set it down on the table with a bang.    \"He's been the ruin o' these parts, he has. He's worse than the  turnip-fly.\"    \"But in what way is he responsible for these evils of which you  complain?\"    The old man peered into his empty mug with a glance of such eloquence  that I could not mistake its import. Accordingly, I caused it to be  refilled, thus preventing any check in the flow of his eloquence, and:    \"In what way?\" he asked, his voice raised in a high quavering note. He  laughed, and his laughter was pitched in the same time-worn key. \"That  doctor is a blot on the country. When Sir Burnham was alive--and afore  he went to Egypt--it was different; although, mind you, it's my  belief--oh, ah, it is indeed--that him coming here had as much to do  with Sir Burnham's death as the loss of his son what I told you  about. That's my belief.\"    I took a sip from my replenished mug, and:    \"I cannot understand,\" I said, \"why the presence of Dr. Greefe should  have brought about the death of Sir Burnham or the death of anybody  else.\"    \"No,\" said the old man, cunningly; \"you can't, eh? Well, there be  things none of us can understand and things some of us can. If you  ever clap eyes on that there black doctor, like enough this'll be one  of the things you'll be able to understand.\"    With the idea of drawing yet more intimate confidences:    \"You suggest that Dr. Greefe had some hold upon the late Sir Burnham?\"    \"I don't suggest nothing.\"    \"Some hold upon Lady Burnham, then?\"    \"Oh, ah, like enough.\"    \"Don't think,\" I added solicitously, \"that I doubt the truth of your  statements in any way, but what could this black doctor, as you call  him, have to gain by persecuting these people?\"    \"There be things,\" replied my aged friend, \"what none of us can  understand, but there be things that all of us do. Oh, ah, there be;  and all of us in these parts knows as Upper Crossleys ain't been the  same since that black doctor settled here. Besides, first Mr. Roger  went, then Sir Burnham went. Now I do read in this 'ere paper as  another of 'em is gone.\"    He held up two gnarled and twitching fingers crossed before him.    \"Did you ever hear tell of the evil eye?\" he asked, and peered at me  cunningly. He took a long drink from his mug. \"But maybe you'll laugh  at _that_,\" he added.    \"I am in no way disposed to laugh at anything you have told me,\" I  assured him; \"and as to the evil eye, I have certainly heard of such a  thing, although I must admit, and I am glad to admit, that I have  never met with it.\"    \"I do trust, sir,\" responded the ancient, \"that such a kind-hearted  gent may never meet with it. Ah, I do trust that you never may, which  is to say, so to speak, as I do trust as you'll never meet that black  doctor. If ever a man, had the evil eye, that black doctor's got it,  and old Mother Shale what lives in the cottage on the heath down  against the windmill, she warned me, she did, three days after he come  here. 'Mr. Corder,' she says, 'that black doctor has the evil eye!'  And never was a truer word spoke. He's been the bane and blight of  this 'ere place, he has.\"    He paused from sheer lack of breath, and having allowed him some  little interval of repose:    \"But what has the evil eye to do with the laying of man-traps and the  shooting of visitors who may chance to cross the estate?\" I inquired.    \"Ah, that's it! But the evil eye, I'm told, goes with the evil heart,  and that man's heart's as black as his face. Blacker,\" he added, on  second thoughts.    \"Yet you have no positive evidence that Dr. Greefe is responsible for  the setting of these man-traps and the attitude of Hawkins?\"    \"Nobody has,\" declared my acquaintance earnestly. \"If anybody had,  we'd have had the law on him long ago.\"    \"And is Lady Burnham often seen about?\" I inquired.    \"Never!\" was the reply. \"She ain't passed the gates of the Park this  twelve months and more.\"    He looked about him covertly, and:    \"It's my belief,\" he affirmed, lowering his quavering voice almost to  a whisper, \"that she'll never pass them gates again alive.\"    \"Oh,\" said I. \"This seems to be a very cheerful neighborhood. Yet in  spite of your wishes on my behalf, I must confess I should like a  glimpse of this black doctor. Does he practice about here?\"    \"Practice? Is it likely?\"    \"Then he has private means?\"    \"His house belongs to the estate,\" was the reply; \"and you can't tell  me he ever pays any rent. As to his means I don't know nothing about  that.\"    I gathered little more of interest from my acquaintance of \"The  Threshers,\" but indeed I had gathered enough, and as I wended my way  back to the Abbey Inn, I was turning over in my mind the extraordinary  story that he had related to me concerning Dr. Damar Greefe.    Clearly the man lived the life of a pariah and I knew not whether to  pity him or otherwise. In an ignorant community it is a dreadful thing  to earn such a reputation as that which evidently attached to the  Eurasian doctor; and this talk of the evil eye took me back  automatically to the early days of this quaint spot, where, cut off  from the larger things of life, the simple folk continued to hold the  same beliefs which had stirred their forefathers. In those remote  times when the white brethren from the neighboring Abbey had held  absolute sway in that country-side, the life history of one accused, as  Dr. Damar Greefe was now accused, of possessing the evil eye, would  very probably have terminated upon a pile of faggots, by order of  Mother Church."]]]
