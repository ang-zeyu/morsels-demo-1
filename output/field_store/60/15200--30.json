Hofmann has that kind of natural technic; so has d'Albert. Of  course I have to practise technic; I would not allow it to lapse; I love  the piano too much to neglect any part of the work. An artist owes it to  himself and the public to keep himself up in perfect condition--for he  must never offer the public anything but the best. I only mean to say I  do not have to work at it as laboriously as some others have to do.  However, I practise technic daily, and will add that I find I can do a  great deal in a short time. When on tour I try to give one hour a day to  it, not more.\"    Speaking of the action of fingers, Mr. Bachaus continued:    \"Why, yes, I raise my fingers whenever and wherever necessary--no more.  Do you know Breithaupt? Well, he does not approve of such technical  exercises as these (illustrating); holding down some fingers and lifting  others, for technical practise, but I do. As for the metronome, I  approve of it to cultivate the sense of rhythm in those who are lacking  in this particular sense. I sometimes use it myself, just to see the  difference between the mechanical rhythm and the musical rhythm--for  they are not always the same by any means.    \"Do you know these Technical Exercises of Brahms? I think a great deal  of them, and, as you see, carry them around with me; they are excellent.    \"You ask me about octaves. It is true they are easy for me now, but I  can remember the time when they were difficult. The only alternative is  to work constantly at them. Of course they are more difficult for small  hands; so care must be taken not to strain nor over-tire the hand. A  little at a time, in frequent doses, ought in six months to work  wonders. Rowing a boat is good to develop wrists for octave playing.    \"You ask if I can tell how I obtain power. That is a very difficult  question. Why does one child learn to swim almost immediately, while  another cannot master it for a long time? To the first it comes  naturally--he has the _knack_, so to speak. And it is just so with the  quality of power at the piano. It certainly is not due to physique, nor  to brute strength, else only the athlete would have sufficient power.  No, it is the 'knack,' or rather it is the result of relaxation, as you  suggest.    \"Take the subject of velocity. I never work for that special thing as  some do. I seldom practise with great velocity, for it interferes with  clearness. I prefer to play more slowly, giving the greatest attention  to clearness and good tone. By pursuing this course I find that when I  need velocity I have it.    \"I am no pedagogue and have no desire to be one. I have no time for  teaching; my own studies and concert work fill all my days. I do not  think that one can both teach and play successfully. If I were teaching  I should no doubt acquire the habit of analyzing and criticizing the  work of others; of explaining and showing just how a thing should be  done. But I am not a critic nor a teacher, so I do not always know how I  produce effects. I play 'as the bird sings,' to quote an old German  song.      MODERN PIANO MUSIC    \"Your MacDowell has written some nice music, some pretty music; I am  familiar with his Concerto in D minor, some of the short pieces and the  Sonatas. As for modern piano concertos there are not many, it is quite  true. There is the Rachmaninoff, the MacDowell I mentioned, the D minor  of Rubinstein, and the Saint-Saens in G minor. There is also a Concerto  by Neitzel, which is a most interesting work; I do not recall that it  has been played in America. I have played it on the other side, and I  may bring it out here during my present tour. This Concerto is a fine  work, into which the author has put his best thought, feeling and  power.\"      A BRAHMS CONCERTO    As I listened to the eloquent reading of the Brahms second Concerto,  which Mr. Bachaus gave soon afterward with the New York Symphony, I was  reminded of a memorable event which occurred during my student days in  Berlin. It was a special concert, at which the honored guest and soloist  was the great Brahms himself. Von Buelow conducted the orchestra, and  Brahms played his second Concerto. The Hamburg master was not a  virtuoso, in the present acceptance of the term: his touch on the piano  was somewhat hard and dry; but he played the work with commendable  dexterity, and made an imposing figure as he sat at the piano, with his  grand head and his long beard. Of course his performance aroused immense  enthusiasm; there was no end of applause and cheering, and then came a  huge laurel wreath. I mentioned this episode to Mr. Bachaus a few days  later.    \"I first played the Brahms Concerto in Vienna under Hans Richter; he had  counseled me to study the work. The Americans are beginning to admire  and appreciate Brahms; he ought to have a great vogue here.    \"In studying such a work, for piano and orchestra, I must not only know  my own part but all the other parts--what each instrument is doing. I  always study a concerto with the orchestral score, so that I can see it  all before me.\"          XXIII    ALEXANDER LAMBERT    AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN TEACHERS      Among American teachers Alexander Lambert takes high rank. For over  twenty-five years he has held aloft the standard of sound musicianship  in the art of teaching and playing. A quarter of a century of thorough,  conscientious effort along these lines must have left its impress upon  the whole rising generation of students and teachers in this country,  and made for the progress and advancement of American art.    It means much to have a native-born teacher of such high aims living and  working among us; a teacher whom no flattery nor love of gain can  influence nor render indifferent to the high aim ever in view. There is  no escaping a sound and thorough course of study for those who come  under Mr. Lambert's supervision. Scales must be, willingly or  unwillingly, the daily bread of the player; the hand must be put in  good shape, the finger joints rendered firm, the arms and body supple,  before pieces are thought of. Technical study must continue along the  whole course, hand in hand with piece playing; technic for its own sake,  outside the playing of compositions. And why not? Is the technic of an  art ever quite finished? Can it ever be laid away on the shelf and  considered complete? Must it not always be kept in working order?    \"Have you not seen many changes in the aims of students, and in the  conditions of piano teaching in New York, during the years you have  taught here?\" I asked Mr. Lambert, in the course of a recent  conversation.    \"Some changes, it is true, I have seen,\" he answered; \"but I must also  say that the conditions attending piano teaching in America are  peculiar. We have some excellent teachers here, teachers who can hold  their own anywhere, and are capable of producing finished artists. Yet  let a pupil go to the best teacher in this country, and the chances are  that he or she is still looking forward to 'finishing' with some  European artist. They are not satisfied until they have secured the  foreign stamp of approval. While this is true of the advanced pianist,  it is even more in evidence in the mediocre player. He, too, is  dreaming of the 'superior advantages,' as he calls them, of European  study. He may have no foundation to build upon--may not even be able to  play a scale correctly, but still thinks he must go abroad!    \"You ask if I think students can obtain just as good instruction here as  in Europe? That is a little difficult to answer off-hand. I fully  believe we have some teachers in America as able as any on the other  side; in some ways they are better. For one thing they are morally  better--I repeat, _morally_ better. For another they are more thorough:  they take more interest in their pupils and will do more for them. When  such a teacher is found, he certainly deserves the deep respect and  gratitude of the American student. But alas, he seldom experiences the  gratitude. After he has done everything for the pupil--fashioned him  into a well-equipped artist, the student is apt to say: 'Now I will go  abroad for lessons with this or that famous European master!' What is  the result? He may never amount to anything--may never be heard of  afterward. On the other hand, I have pupils coming to me, who have been  years with some of the greatest foreign masters, yet who are full of  faults of all kinds, faults which it takes me years to correct. Some of  them come with hard touch, with tense position and condition of arms and  body, with faulty pedaling, and with a lack of knowledge of some of the  fundamental principles of piano playing.      POWER WITHOUT EFFORT    \"How do I teach them to acquire power with little effort? Relaxation is  the whole secret. Your arm is really quite heavy, it weighs  considerable. Act on this principle then: let the arms fall with their  full weight on the keys, and you will have all the power you need,  provided the fingers are rounded and firm. That is the other half of the  secret. The finger joints must be firm, especially the third joint. It  stands to reason there can be no power, no brilliancy when this joint is  wavering and wobbling.    \"I teach arched hand position, and, for children and beginners, decided  finger action; the fingers are to be raised, in the beginning, though  not too high. Some teachers may not teach finger action, because they  say artists do not use it. But the artist, if questioned, would tell you  he had to learn finger action in the beginning. There are so many stages  in piano playing. The beginner must raise his fingers in order to  acquire finger development and a good, clear touch. In the middle stage  he has secured enough finger control to play the same passage with less  action, and still perform it with sufficient clearness;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#20)"],[1,"and  what nightmares of haunting Fear, man has slowly emerged--and is  even now only slowly emerging; by remembering also that the ancient  ceremonies and rituals of Magic and Fear remained on and were cultivated  by the multitude in each nation long after the bolder and nobler spirits  had attained to breathe a purer air; by remembering that even to the  present day in each individual the Old and the New are for a long period  thus intricately intertangled. It is hard to believe that the practice  of human and animal sacrifice (with whatever revolting details) should  have been cultivated by nine-tenths of the human race over the globe  out of sheer perversity and without some reason which at any rate to  the perpetrators themselves appeared commanding and convincing. To-day  (1918) we are witnessing in the Great European War a carnival of human  slaughter which in magnitude and barbarity eclipses in one stroke all  the accumulated ceremonial sacrifices of historical ages; and when  we ask the why and wherefore of this horrid spectacle we are told,  apparently in all sincerity, and by both the parties engaged, of the  noble objects and commanding moralities which inspire and compel it. We  can hardly, in this last case, disbelieve altogether in the genuineness  of the plea, so why should we do so in the former case? In both cases we  perceive that underneath the surface pretexts and moralities Fear is and  was the great urging and commanding force.     (1) Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 3.      The truth is that Sin and Sacrifice represent--if you once allow for the  overwhelming sway of fear--perfectly reasonable views of human conduct,  adopted instinctively by mankind since the earliest times. If in a  moment of danger or an access of selfish greed you deserted your brother  tribesman or took a mean advantage of him, you 'sinned' against him; and  naturally you expiated the sin by an equivalent sacrifice of some kind  made to the one you had wronged. Such an idea and such a practice were  the very foundation of social life and human morality, and must have  sprung up as soon as ever, in the course of evolution, man became  CAPABLE of differentiating himself from his fellows and regarding his  own conduct as that of a 'separate self.' It was in the very conception  of a separate self that 'sin' and disunity first began; and it was  by 'sacrifice' that unity and harmony were restored, appeasement and  atonement effected.    But in those earliest times, as I have already indicated more than once,  man felt himself intimately related not only to his brother tribesman,  but to the animals and to general Nature. It was not so much that he  THOUGHT thus as that he never thought OTHERWISE! He FELT subconsciously  that he was a part of all this outer world. And so he adopted for his  totems or presiding spirits every possible animal, as we have seen,  and all sorts of nature-phenomena, such as rain and fire and water and  clouds, and sun, moon and stars--which WE consider quite senseless and  inanimate. Towards these apparently senseless things therefore he felt  the same compunction as I have described him feeling towards his brother  tribesmen. He could sin against them too. He could sin against his  totem-animal by eating it; he could sin against his 'brother the ox' by  consuming its strength in the labor of the plough; he could sin against  the corn by cutting it down and grinding it into flour, or against the  precious and beautiful pine-tree by laying his axe to its roots and  converting it into mere timber for his house. Further still, no doubt he  could sin against elemental nature. This might be more difficult to be  certain of, but when the signs of elemental displeasure were not to be  mistaken--when the rain withheld itself for months, or the storms and  lightning dealt death and destruction, when the crops failed or evil  plagues afflicted mankind--then there could be little uncertainty that  he had sinned; and Fear, which had haunted him like a demon from the  first day when he became conscious of his separation from his fellows  and from Nature, stood over him and urged to dreadful propitiations.    In all these cases some sacrifice in reparation was the obvious thing.  We have seen that to atone for the cutting-down of the corn a human  victim would often be slaughtered. The corn-spirit clearly approved of  this, for wherever the blood and remains of the victim were strewn the  corn always sprang up more plentifully. The tribe or human group made  reparation thus to the corn; the corn-spirit signified approval. The  'sin' was expiated and harmony restored. Sometimes the sacrifice was  voluntarily offered by a tribesman; sometimes it was enforced, by lot  or otherwise; sometimes the victim was a slave, or a captive enemy;  sometimes even an animal. All that did not so much matter. The main  thing was that the formal expiation had been carried out, and the wrath  of the spirits averted.    It is known that tribes whose chief food-animal was the bear felt it  necessary to kill and cat a bear occasionally; but they could not do  this without a sense of guilt, and some fear of vengeance from the great  Bear-spirit. So they ate the slain bear at a communal feast in which  the tribesmen shared the guilt and celebrated their community with their  totem and with each other. And since they could not make any reparation  directly to the slain animal itself AFTER its death, they made their  reparation BEFORE, bringing all sorts of presents and food to it for a  long anterior period, and paying every kind of worship and respect to  it. The same with the bull and the ox. At the festival of the Bouphonia,  in some of the cities of Greece as I have already mentioned, the actual  bull sacrificed was the handsomest and most carefully nurtured that  could be obtained; it was crowned with flowers and led in procession  with every mark of reverence and worship. And when--as I have already  pointed out--at the great Spring festival, instead of a bull or a goat  or a ram, a HUMAN victim was immolated, it was a custom (which can be  traced very widely over the world) to feed and indulge and honor the  victim to the last degree for a WHOLE YEAR before the final ceremony,  arraying him often as a king and placing a crown upon his head, by way  of acknowledgment of the noble and necessary work he was doing for the  general good.    What a touching and beautiful ceremony was that--belonging especially  to the North of Syria, and lands where the pine is so beneficent and  beloved a tree--the mourning ceremony of the death and burial of Attis!  when a pine-tree, felled by the axe, was hollowed out, and in the hollow  an image (often itself carved out of pinewood) of the young Attis was  placed. Could any symbolism express more tenderly the idea that the  glorious youth--who represented Spring, too soon slain by the rude tusk  of Winter--was himself the very human soul of the pine-tree? (1) At some  earlier period, no doubt, a real youth had been sacrificed and his body  bound within the pine; but now it was deemed sufficient for the maidens  to sing their wild songs of lamentation; and for the priests and male  enthusiasts to cut and gash themselves with knives, or to sacrifice  (as they did) to the Earth-mother the precious blood offering of their  virile organs--symbols of fertility in return for the promised and  expected renewal of Nature and the crops in the coming Spring. For  the ceremony, as we have already seen, did not end with death and  lamentation, but led on, perfectly naturally, after a day or two to a  festival of resurrection, when it was discovered--just as in the case of  Osiris--that the pine-tree coffin was empty, and the immortal life had  flown. How strange the similarity and parallelism of all these things to  the story of Jesus in the Gospels--the sacrifice of a life made in order  to bring salvation to men and expiation of sins, the crowning of the  victim, and arraying in royal attire, the scourging and the mockery, the  binding or nailing to a tree, the tears of Mary, and the resurrection  and the empty coffin!--or how not at all strange when we consider in  what numerous forms and among how many peoples, this same parable  and ritual had as a matter of fact been celebrated, and how it had  ultimately come down to bring its message of redemption into a somewhat  obscure Syrian city, in the special shape with which we are familiar.     (1) See Julius Firmicus, who says (De Errore, c. 28): \"in sacris  Phrygiis, quae Matris deum dicunt, per annos singulos arbor pinea  caeditur, et in media arbore simulacrum uvenis subligatur. In Isiacis  sacris de pinea arbore caeditur truncus; hujus trunci media pars  subtiliter excavatur, illis de segminibus factum idolum Osiridis  sepelitur. In Prosperpinae sacris caesa arbor in effigiem virginis  formaraque componitur, et cum intra civitatem fuerit illata, quadraginta  noctibus piangitur, quadragesima vero nocte comburitur.\"      Though the parable or legend in its special Christian form bears with it  the consciousness of the presence of beings whom we may call gods, it is  important to remember that in many or most of its earlier forms, though  it dealt in 'spirits'--the spirit of the corn, or the spirit of the  Spring, or the spirits of the rain and the thunder, or the spirits of  totem-animals--it had not yet quite risen to the idea of gods. It  had not risen to the conception of eternal deities sitting apart and  governing the world in solemn conclave--as from the slopes of Olympus  or the recesses of the Christian Heaven. It belonged, in fact, in its  inception, to the age of Magic. The creed of Sin and Sacrifice, or of  Guilt and Expiation--whatever we like to call it--was evolved perfectly  naturally out of the human mind when brought face to face with Life  and Nature) at some early stage of its self-consciousness. It was  essentially the result of "]]]
