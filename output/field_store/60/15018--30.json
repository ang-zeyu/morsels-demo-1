They are offering an  immense reward however--a very pleasant sum, indeed. I have had a short  note from Radcot Hall informing me of the amount, and that's all. Probably  they fancy that I may take the case up as a speculation, but that is a  great mistake. I'm not a beginner, and I must be commissioned in a regular  manner, hit or miss, if I am to deal with the case. I've quite enough  commissions going now, and no time to waste hunting for a problematical  reward.\"    But we were nearer a clue to the Quinton jewels than we then supposed.    We talked of other things, and presently rose and left the restaurant,  strolling quietly toward home. Some little distance from the Strand, and  near our own door, we passed an excited Irishman--without doubt an  Irishman by appearance and talk--who was pouring a torrent of angry  complaints in the ears of a policeman. The policeman obviously thought  little of the man's grievances, and with an amused smile appeared to be  advising him to go home quietly and think no more about it. We passed on  and mounted our stairs. Something interesting in our conversation made me  stop for a little while at Hewitt's office door on my way up, and, while I  stood there, the Irishman we had seen in the street mounted the stairs. He  was a poorly dressed but sturdy-looking fellow, apparently a laborer, in a  badly-worn best suit of clothes. His agitation still held him, and without  a pause he immediately burst out:    \"Which of ye jintlemen will be Misther Hewitt, sor?\"    \"This is Mr. Hewitt,\" I said. \"Do you want him?\"    \"It's protecshin I want, sor--protecshin! I spake to the polis, an' they  laff at me, begob. Foive days have I lived in London, an' 'tis nothin' but  battle, murdher, an' suddhen death for me here all day an' ivery day! An'  the polis say I'm dhrunk!\"    He gesticulated wildly, and to me it seemed just possible that the police  might be right.    \"They say I'm drunk, sor,\" he continued, \"but, begob, I b'lieve they think  I'm mad. An' me being thracked an' folleyed an' dogged an' waylaid an'  poisoned an' blandandhered an' kidnapped an' murdhered, an' for why I do  not know!\"    \"And who's doing all this?'    \"Sthrangers, sor--sthrangers. 'Tis a sthranger here I am mesilf, an' fwy  they do it bates me, onless I do be so like the Prince av Wales or other  crowned head they thry to slaughter me. They're layin' for me in the  sthreet now, I misdoubt not, and fwat they may thry next I can tell no  more than the Lord Mayor. An' the polis won't listen to me!\"    This, I thought, must be one of the very common cases of mental  hallucination which one hears of every day--the belief of the sufferer  that he is surrounded by enemies and followed by spies. It is probably the  most usual delusion of the harmless lunatic.    \"But what have these people done?\" Hewitt asked, looking rather  interested, although amused. \"What actual assaults have they committed,  and when? And who told you to come here?\"    \"Who towld me, is ut? Who but the payler outside--in the street below! I  explained to 'um, an' sez he: 'Ah, you go an' take a slape,' sez he; 'you  go an' take a good slape, an' they'll be all gone whin ye wake up.' 'But  they'll murdher me,' sez I. 'Oh, no!' sez he, smilin' behind av his ugly  face. 'Oh, no, they won't; you take ut aisy, me frind, an' go home!' 'Take  it aisy, is ut, an' go home!' sez I; 'why, that's just where they've been  last, a-ruinationin' an' a-turnin' av the place upside down, an' me strook  on the head onsensible a mile away. Take ut aisy, is ut, ye say, whin all  the demons in this unholy place is jumpin' on me every minut in places  promiscuous till I can't tell where to turn, descendin' an' vanishin'  marvelious an' onaccountable? Take ut aisy, is ut?' sez I. 'Well, me  frind,' sez he, 'I can't help ye; that's the marvelious an' onaccountable  departmint up the stairs forninst ye. Misther Hewitt ut is,' sez he, 'that  attinds to the onaccountable departmint, him as wint by a minut ago. You  go an' bother him.' That's how I was towld, sor.\"    Hewitt smiled.    \"Very good,\" he said; \"and now what are these extraordinary troubles of  yours? Don't declaim,\" he added, as the Irishman raised his hand and  opened his mouth, preparatory to another torrent of complaint; \"just say  in ten words, if you can, what they've done to you.\"    \"I will, sor. Wan day had I been in London, sor--wan day only, an' a low  scutt thried to poison me dhrink; next day some udther thief av sin shoved  me off av a railway platform undher a train, malicious and purposeful;  glory be, he didn't kill me! but the very docther that felt me bones  thried to pick me pockut, I du b'lieve. Sunday night I was grabbed  outrageous in a darrk turnin', rowled on the groun', half strangled, an'  me pockuts nigh ripped out av me trousies. An' this very blessed mornin'  av light I was strook onsensible an' left a livin' corpse, an' my lodgin's  penethrated an' all the thruck mishandled an' bruk up behind me back. Is  that a panjandhery for the polis to laff at, sor?\"    Had Hewitt not been there I think I should have done my best to quiet the  poor fellow with a few soothing words and to persuade him to go home to  his friends. His excited and rather confused manner, his fantastic story  of a sort of general conspiracy to kill him, and the absurd reference to  the doctor who tried to pick his pocket seemed to me plainly to confirm my  first impression that he was insane. But Hewitt appeared strangely  interested.    \"Did they steal anything?\" he asked.    \"Divil a shtick but me door-key, an' that they tuk home an' lift in the  door.\"    Hewitt opened his office door.    \"Come in,\" he said, \"and tell me all about this. You come, too, Brett.\"    The Irishman and I followed him into the inner office, where, shutting the  door, Hewitt suddenly turned on the Irishman and exclaimed sharply: \"_Then  you've still got it_?\"    He looked keenly in the man's eyes, but the only expression there was one  of surprise.    \"Got ut?\" said the Irishman. \"Got fwhat, sor? Is ut you're thinkin' I've  got the horrors, as well as the polis?\"    Hewitt's gaze relaxed. \"Sit down, sit down!\" he said. \"You've still got  your watch and money, I suppose, since you weren't robbed?\"    \"Oh, that? Glory be, I have ut still! though for how long--or me own head,  for that matter--in this state of besiegement, I can not say.\"    \"Now,\" said Hewitt, \"I want a full, true, and particular account of  yourself and your doings for the last week. First, your name?\"    \"Leamy's my name, sor--Michael Leamy.\"    \"Lately from Ireland?\"    \"Over from Dublin this last blessed Wednesday, and a crooil bad  poundherin' tit was in the boat, too--shpakin'av that same.\"    \"Looking for work?\"    \"That is my purshuit at prisint, sor.\"    \"Did anything noticeable happen before these troubles of yours  began--anything here in London or on the journey?\"    \"Sure,\" the Irishman smiled, \"part av the way I thraveled first-class by  favor av the gyard, an' I got a small job before I lift the train.\"    \"How was that? Why did you travel first-class part of the way?\"    \"There was a station fwhere we shtopped afther a long run, an' I got down  to take the cramp out av me joints, an' take a taste av dhrink. I  over-shtayed somehow, an', whin I got to the train, begob, it was on the  move. There was a first-class carr'ge door opin right forninst me, an'  into that the gyard crams me holus-bolus. There was a juce of a foine  jintleman sittin' there, an' he stares at me umbrageous, but I was not  dishcommoded, bein' onbashful by natur'. We thravelled along a heap av  miles more, till we came near London. Afther we had shtopped at a station  where they tuk tickets we wint ahead again, an' prisintly, as we rips  through some udther station, up jumps the jintleman opposite, swearin'  hard undher his tongue, an' looks out at the windy. 'I thought this train  shtopped here,' sez he.\"    \"Chalk Farm,\" observed Hewitt, with a nod.    \"The name I do not know, sor, but that's fwhat he said. Then he looks at  me onaisy for a little, an' at last he sez: 'Wud ye loike a small job, me  good man, well paid?'    \"'Faith,' sez I, ''tis that will suit me well.'    \"'Then, see here,' sez he, 'I should have got out at that station, havin'  particular business; havin' missed, I must sen' a telegrammer from Euston.  Now, here's a bag,' sez he, 'a bag full of imporrtant papers for my  solicitor--imporrtant to me, ye ondershtand, not worth the shine av a  brass farden to a sowl else--an' I want 'em tuk on to him. Take you this  bag,' he sez, 'an' go you straight out wid it at Euston an' get a cab. I  shall stay in the station a bit to see to the telegrammer. Dhrive out av  the station, across the road outside, an' wait there five minuts by the  clock. Ye ondershtand? Wait five minuts, an, maybe I'll come an' join ye.  If I don't 'twill be bekase I'm detained onexpected, an' then ye'll dhrive  to my solicitor straight. Here's his address, if ye can read writin',' an'  he put ut on a piece av paper. He gave me half-a-crown for the cab, an' I  tuk his bag.\"    \"One moment--have you the paper with the address now?\"    \"I have not, sor. I missed ut afther the blayguards overset me yesterday;  but the solicitor's name was Hollams, an' a liberal jintleman wid his  money he was, too, by that same token.\"    \"What was his address?\"    \"'Twas in Chelsea, and 'twas Gold or Golden something, which I know by the  good token av fwhat he gave me; but the number I misremember.\"    Hewitt turned to his directory. \"Gold Street is the place, probably,\" he  said, \"and it seems to be a street chiefly of private houses. You would be  able to point out the house if you were taken there, I suppose?\"    \"I should that, sor; indade, I was thinkin' av goin'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11255"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#20)"],[1,"old. I try to live as good as my age.  Every year I try to live a little better, 'A little sweeter as the years  go by.'\"          Interviewer: Samuel S. Taylor  Person interviewed: Cyrus Bellus                      1320 Pulaski Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 73      [HW: Made Own Cloth]    \"I was born in Mississippi in 1865 in Jefferson County. It was on the  tenth of March. My father's name was Cyrus Bellus, the same as mine. My  mother's name was Matilda Bellus.    \"My father's master was David Hunt. My father and mother both belonged  to him. They had the same master. I don't know the names of my  grandfather and mother. I think they were Jordons. No, I know my  grandmother's name was Annie Hall, and my grandfather's name was Stephen  Hall. Those were my mother's grandparents. My father's father was named  John Major and his mother was named Dinah Major. They belonged to the  Hunts. I don't know why the names was different. I guess he wasn't their  first master.      Slave Sales, Whippings, Work    \"I have heard my folks talk about how they were traded off and how they  used to have to work. Their master wouldn't allow them to whip his  hands. No, it was the mistress that wouldn't allow them to be whipped.  They had hot words about that sometimes.    \"The slaves had to weave cotton and knit sox. Sometimes they would work  all night, weaving cloth, and spinning thread. The spinning would be  done first. They would make cloth for all the hands on the place.    \"They used to have tanning vats to make shoes with too. Old master  didn't know what it was to buy shoes. Had a man there to make them.    \"My father and mother were both field hands. They didn't weave or spin.  My grandmother on my mother's side did that. They were supposed to  pick--the man, four hundred pounds of cotton, and the woman three  hundred. And that was gittin' some cotton. If they didn't come up to the  task, they was took out and give a whipping. The overseer would do the  thrashing. The old mistress and master wouldn't agree on that whipping.      Fun    \"The slaves were allowed to get out and have their fun and play and  'musement for so many hours. Outside of those hours, they had to be  found in their house. They had to use fiddles. They had dancing just  like the boys do now. They had knockin' and rasslin' and all such like  now.      Church    \"So for as serving God was concerned, they had to take a kettle and turn  it down bottom upward and then old master couldn't hear the singing and  prayin'. I don't know just how they turned the kettle to keep the noise  from goin' out. But I heard my father and mother say they did it. The  kettle would be on the inside of the cabin, not on the outside.      House, Furniture, Food    \"The slaves lived in log houses instead of ones like now with  weather-boarding. The two ends duffed in. They always had them so they  would hold a nice family. Never had any partitions to make rooms. It was  just a straight long house with one window and one door.    \"Provisions were weighed out to them. They were allowed four pounds of  meat and a peck of meal for each working person. They only provided for  the working folks. If I had eight in a family, I would just get the same  amount. There was no provisions for children.    \"But all the children on the place were given something from the big  house. The working folks ate their breakfast before daylight in the log  cabin where they lived. They ate their supper at home too. They was  allowed to get back home by seven or eight o'clock. The slaves on my  place never ate together. I don't know anything about that kind of  feeding.    \"They had nurses, old folks that weren't able to work any longer. All  the children would go to the same place to be cared for and the old  people would look after them. They wasn't able to work, you know. They  fed the children during the day.      How Freedom Came    \"My father and mother and grandmother said the overseer told them that  they were free. I guess that was in 1865, the same year I was born. The  overseer told them that they didn't have any owner now. They was free  folks. The boss man told them too--had them to come up to the big house  and told them they had to look out for themselves now because they were  free as he was.      Right After the War    \"Right after emancipation, my folks were freed. The boss man told them  they could work by the day or sharecrop or they could work by groups. A  group of folks could go together and work and the boss man would pay  them so much a day. I believe they worked for him a good while--about  seven or eight years at least. They was in one of the groups.      Earliest Recollections    \"My own earliest recollections was of picking cotton in one of those  squads--the groups I was telling you about. After that, the people got  to renting land and renting stock for themselves. They sharecropped  then. It seems to me that everybody was satisfied. I don't remember any  one saying that he was cheated or beat out of anything.      Schooling    \"We had a public school to open in Jefferson County, Mississippi. We  called it Dobbins Bridge. There was a bridge about a mile long built  across the creek. We had two colored women for teachers. Their names was  Mary Howard and Hester Harris. They only used two teachers in that  school. I attended there three years to those same two women.    \"We had a large family and I quit to help take care of it.      Ku Klux    \"I don't think there was much disturbance from the Ku Klux on that  plantation. The colored folks didn't take much part in politics.      Later Life    \"I stopped school and went to work for good at about fifteen years. I  worked at the field on that same plantation I told you about. I worked  there for just about ten years. Then I farmed at the same place on  shares. I stayed there till I was 'bout twenty-six years old. Then I  moved to Wilderness Place in the Cotton Belt in Mississippi. I farmed  there for two years.    \"I farmed around Greenville, Mississippi for a while. Then I left  Greenville and came to Arkansas. I come straight to Little Rock. The  first thing I did I went into the lumber grading. I wasn't trained to  it, but I went into it at the request of the men who employed me. I  stayed in that eight years. I learned the lumber grading and checking.  Checking is seeing the size and width and length and kind of lumber and  seeing how much of it there is in a car without taking it out, you know.    \"I married about 1932. My wife is dead. We never had any children.    \"I haven't worked any now in five years. I have been to the hospital in  the east end. I get old age assistance--eight dollars and commodities.\"          Interviewer: Mrs. Bernice Bowden  Person interviewed: Bob Benford                      209 N. Maple Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 79      \"Slavery-time folks? Here's one of em. Near as I can get at it, I'se  seventy-nine. I was born in Alabama. My white folks said I come from  Perry County, Alabama, but I come here to this Arkansas country when I  was small.    \"My old master was Jim Ad Benford. He was good to us. I'm goin' to tell  you we was better off then than now. Yes ma'am, they treated us right.  We didn't have to worry bout payin' the doctor and had plenty to eat.    \"I recollect the shoemaker come and measured my feet and directly he'd  bring me old red russet shoes. I thought they was the prettiest things I  ever saw in my life.    \"Old mistress would say, 'Come on here, you little niggers' and she'd  sprinkle sugar on the meat block and we'd just lick sugar.    \"I remember the soldiers good, had on blue suits with brass buttons.    \"I'se big enough to ride old master's hoss to water. He'd say, 'Now,  Bob, don't you run that hoss' but when I got out of sight, I was bound  to run that hoss a little.    \"I didn't have to work, just stayed in the house with my mammy. She was  a seamstress. I'm tellin' you the truth now. I can tell it at night as  well as daytime.    \"We lived in Union County. Old master had a lot of hands. Old mistress'  name was Miss Sallie Benford. She just as good as she could be. She'd  come out to the quarters to see how we was gettin' along. I'd be so glad  when Christmas come. We'd have hog killin' and I'd get the bladders and  blow em up to make noise--you know. Yes, lady, we'd have a time.    \"I recollect when Marse Jim broke up and went to Texas. Stayed there  bout a year and come back. [HW: migration?]    \"When the war was over I recollect they said we was free but I didn't  know what that meant. I was always free.    \"After freedom mammy stayed there on the place and worked on the shares.  I don't know nothin' bout my father. They said he was a white man.    \"I remember I was out in the field with mammy and had a old mule. I  punched him with a stick and he come back with them hoofs and kicked me  right in the jaw--knocked me dead. Lord, lady, I had to eat mush till I  don't like mush today. That was old Mose--he was a saddle mule.    \"Me? I ain't been to school a day in my life. If I had a chance to go I  didn't know it. I had to help mammy work. I recollect one time when she  was sick I got into a fight and she cried and said, 'That's the way you  does my child' and I know she died next week.    \"After that I worked here and there. I remember the first run I worked  for was Kinch McKinney of El Dorado.    \"I remember when I was just learnin' to plow, old mule knew five hundred  times more than I did. He was graduated and he learnt me.    \"I made fifty-seven crops in my lifetime. Me and Hance Chapman--he was  my witness when I married--we made four bales that year. That was in  1879. His father got two bales and Hance and me got two. I made money  every year. Yes ma'am, I have made some money in my day.
