[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16726"],[0,"Four Weird Tales (#20)"],[1," Lady Statham! At first the name had disappointed him. So many folk wear  titles, as syllables in certain tongues wear accents--without them being  mute, unnoticed, unpronounced. Nonentities, born to names, so often  claim attention for their insignificance in this way. But this woman,  had she been Jemima Jones, would have made the name distinguished and  select. She was a big and sombre personality. Why was it, he wondered  afterwards, that for a moment something in him shrank, and that his  mind, metaphorically speaking, flung up an arm in self-protection? The  instinct flashed and passed. But it seemed to him born of an automatic  feeling that he must protect--not himself, but the woman from the man.  There was confusion in it all; links were missing. He studied her  intently. She was a woman who had none of the external feminine signals  in either dress or manner, no graces, no little womanly hesitations and  alarms, no daintiness, yet neither anything distinctly masculine. Her  charm was strong, possessing; only he kept forgetting that he was  talking to a--woman; and the thing she inspired in him included, with  respect and wonder, somewhere also this curious hint of dread. This  instinct to protect her fled as soon as it was born, for the interest of  the conversation in which she so quickly plunged him obliterated all  minor emotions whatsoever. Here, for the first time, he drew close to  Egypt, the Egypt he had sought so long. It was not to be explained. He  _felt_ it.    Beginning with commonplaces, such as \"You like Egypt? You find here what  you expected?\" she led him into better regions with \"One finds here what  one brings.\" He knew the delightful experience of talking fluently on  subjects he was at home in, and to some one who understood. The feeling  at first that to this woman he could not say mere anythings, slipped  into its opposite--that he could say everything. Strangers ten minutes  ago, they were at once in deep and intimate talk together. He found his  ideas readily followed, agreed with up to a point--the point which  permits discussion to start from a basis of general accord towards  speculation. In the excitement of ideas he neglected the uncomfortable  note that had stirred his caution, forgot the warning too. Her mind,  moreover, seemed known to him; he was often aware of what she was going  to say before he actually heard it; the current of her thoughts struck a  familiar gait, and more than once he experienced vividly again the odd  sensation that it all had happened before. The very sentences and  phrases with which she pointed the turns of her unusual ideas were never  wholly unexpected.    For her ideas were decidedly unusual, in the sense that she accepted  without question speculations not commonly deemed worth consideration at  all, indeed not ordinarily even known. Henriot knew them, because he had  read in many fields. It was the strength of her belief that fascinated  him. She offered no apologies. She knew. And while he talked, she  listening with folded arms and her black eyes fixed upon his own,  Richard Vance watched with vigilant eyes and listened too, ceaselessly  alert. Vance joined in little enough, however, gave no opinions, his  attitude one of general acquiescence. Twice, when pauses of slackening  interest made it possible, Henriot fancied he surprised another quality  in this negative attitude. Interpreting it each time differently, he yet  dismissed both interpretations with a smile. His imagination leaped so  absurdly to violent conclusions. They were not tenable: Vance was  neither her keeper, nor was he in some fashion a detective. Yet in his  manner was sometimes this suggestion of the detective order. He watched  with such deep attention, and he concealed it so clumsily with an  affectation of careless indifference.    There is nothing more dangerous than that impulsive intimacy strangers  sometimes adopt when an atmosphere of mutual sympathy takes them by  surprise, for it is akin to the false frankness friends affect when  telling \"candidly\" one another's faults. The mood is invariably  regretted later. Henriot, however, yielded to it now with something like  abandon. The pleasure of talking with this woman was so unexpected, and  so keen.    For Lady Statham believed apparently in some Egypt of her dreams. Her  interest was neither historical, archaeological, nor political. It was  religious--yet hardly of this earth at all. The conversation turned upon  the knowledge of the ancient Egyptians from an unearthly point of view,  and even while he talked he was vaguely aware that it was _her_ mind  talking through his own. She drew out his ideas and made him say them.  But this he was properly aware of only afterwards--that she had  cleverly, mercilessly pumped him of all he had ever known or read upon  the subject. Moreover, what Vance watched so intently was himself, and  the reactions in himself this remarkable woman produced. That also he  realised later.    His first impression that these two belonged to what may be called the  \"crank\" order was justified by the conversation. But, at least, it was  interesting crankiness, and the belief behind it made it even  fascinating. Long before the end he surprised in her a more vital form  of his own attitude that anything _may_ be true, since knowledge has  never yet found final answers to any of the biggest questions.    He understood, from sentences dropped early in the talk, that she was  among those few \"superstitious\" folk who think that the old Egyptians  came closer to reading the eternal riddles of the world than any  others, and that their knowledge was a remnant of that ancient Wisdom  Religion which existed in the superb, dark civilization of the sunken  Atlantis, lost continent that once joined Africa to Mexico. Eighty  thousand years ago the dim sands of Poseidonis, great island adjoining  the main continent which itself had vanished a vast period before, sank  down beneath the waves, and the entire known world to-day was descended  from its survivors.    Hence the significant fact that all religions and \"mythological\" systems  begin with a story of a flood--some cataclysmic upheaval that destroyed  the world. Egypt itself was colonised by a group of Atlantean priests  who brought their curious, deep knowledge with them. They had foreseen  the cataclysm.    Lady Statham talked well, bringing into her great dream this strong,  insistent quality of belief and fact. She knew, from Plato to Donelly,  all that the minds of men have ever speculated upon the gorgeous legend.  The evidence for such a sunken continent--Henriot had skimmed it too in  years gone by--she made bewilderingly complete. He had heard Baconians  demolish Shakespeare with an array of evidence equally overwhelming. It  catches the imagination though not the mind. Yet out of her facts, as  she presented them, grew a strange likelihood. The force of this woman's  personality, and her calm and quiet way of believing all she talked  about, took her listener to some extent--further than ever before,  certainly--into the great dream after her. And the dream, to say the  least, was a picturesque one, laden with wonderful possibilities. For as  she talked the spirit of old Egypt moved up, staring down upon him out  of eyes lidded so curiously level. Hitherto all had prated to him of the  Arabs, their ancient faith and customs, and the splendour of the  Bedouins, those Princes of the Desert. But what he sought, barely  confessed in words even to himself, was something older far than this.  And this strange, dark woman brought it close. Deeps in his soul, long  slumbering, awoke. He heard forgotten questions.    Only in this brief way could he attempt to sum up the storm she roused  in him.    She carried him far beyond mere outline, however, though afterwards he  recalled the details with difficulty. So much more was suggested than  actually expressed. She contrived to make the general modern scepticism  an evidence of cheap mentality. It was so easy; the depth it affects to  conceal, mere emptiness. \"We have tried all things, and found all  wanting\"--the mind, as measuring instrument, merely confessed  inadequate. Various shrewd judgments of this kind increased his respect,  although her acceptance went so far beyond his own. And, while the label  of credulity refused to stick to her, her sense of imaginative wonder  enabled her to escape that dreadful compromise, a man's mind in a  woman's temperament. She fascinated him.    The spiritual worship of the ancient Egyptians, she held, was a  symbolical explanation of things generally alluded to as the secrets of  life and death; their knowledge was a remnant of the wisdom of Atlantis.  Material relics, equally misunderstood, still stood to-day at Karnac,  Stonehenge, and in the mysterious writings on buried Mexican temples and  cities, so significantly akin to the hieroglyphics upon the Egyptian  tombs.    \"The one misinterpreted as literally as the other,\" she suggested, \"yet  both fragments of an advanced knowledge that found its grave in the sea.  The Wisdom of that old spiritual system has vanished from the world,  only a degraded literalism left of its undecipherable language. The  jewel has been lost, and the casket is filled with sand, sand, sand.\"    How keenly her black eyes searched his own as she said it, and how oddly  she made the little word resound. The syllable drew out almost into  chanting. Echoes answered from the depths within him, carrying it on and  on across some desert of forgotten belief. Veils of sand flew everywhere  about his mind. Curtains lifted. Whole hills of sand went shifting into  level surfaces whence gardens of dim outline emerged to meet the  sunlight.    \"But the sand may be removed.\" It was her nephew, speaking almost for  the first time, and the interruption had an odd effect, introducing a  sharply practical element. For the tone expressed, so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#20)"],[1," element or simple substance diffused  generally through nature, and its different combinations are essential  to animal life and combustion. It is, in fact, the most active agent  in nature, and the principle of acidity and combustion. So wholesome  and necessary is oxygen to life, that it is often called vital air.         _Agent_, an actor; a person or thing possessing the faculty       of action.         _Essential_, necessary.      What are the properties of Nitrogen or Azote?    Nitrogen is a substance also generally diffused through nature, and  particularly in animal bodies, and causes great changes in those  absorbing or exposed to it. This gas, combined with oxygen and  hydrogen, produces neither light, heat, nor combustion, but serves to  dilute the others: of itself, it is hurtful to animal life. Nitrogen  makes the principal part of the salt we call _nitre_.      What is meant by Combustion?    The decomposition of bodies by the action of fire; the union of  combustible bodies with the oxygen of the atmosphere. The greater  access the air has to a burning body, the more rapid and complete is  the process.         _Combustible_, capable of taking fire.         _Access_, the means or liberty of approach to anything.      Are all bodies equally combustible?    No; some are more so than others, and burn with a bright flame; as  wood, dry vegetables, resins, oils, fats, &c.; others with difficulty,  and without any sensible flame, as soot, coal, the ashes of plants,  &c. There are bodies, also, which are incombustible--that is,  incapable of taking fire, as some alkalies, earths, &c.      What is Caloric?    Caloric is that invisible agent which produces the sensation of heat.  It exists in all bodies; it is a force we are ever in want of, and  thus it is hid in everything around us, and penetrates all matter,  however different may be its nature or properties.      What is meant by Gas?    All highly elastic fluids are called gases. Some are salutary, but  many extremely noxious, especially such as those arising from the  putrefaction of animal bodies; the burning of charcoal; corrupted air  at the bottom of mines, cellars, &c. The inflammable gas, which lights  our streets, churches, shops, &c., is procured chiefly from coal,  burnt in furnaces for the purpose the gas being passed through metal  pipes, conveyed underground to the places where the light is required:  escaping at the orifice prepared for it, it is lighted when wanted,  and burns with, a brilliant flame. This gas consists of hydrogen and  carbon; and the oxygen of the air, combined with the hydrogen, causes  light as long as hydrogen and oxygen exist and combine.         _Salutary_, wholesome, healthful.         _Noxious_, hurtful, unwholesome.         _Putrefaction_, decay.         _Orifice_, opening, hole.    [Illustration: DIAMOND CUTTING AND POLISHING.]      What is Hydrogen?    One of the most abundant principles in nature; one part of it, and  eight of oxygen, form water. It is only met with in a gaseous form;  it is also very inflammable, and is the gas called the fire-damp, so  often fatal to miners; it is the chief constituent of oils, fats,  spirits, &c.; and is produced by the decomposition of water.         _Constituent_, that which forms an essential part of       anything.      What is Chalk?    A white fossil substance, by some reckoned a stone, but of a friable  kind, which cannot, therefore, be polished as marble; by others, more  properly ranked among the earths. It is of two sorts, one a hard dry  chalk, used for making lime; the other a soft, unctuous kind, used in  manuring land, &c. Chalk always contains quantities of flint-stone,  and the fossil remains of shells, coral, animal bones, marine plants,  &c.; from which circumstance there can be no doubt that _chalk is the  deposited mud of a former ocean_. The chemical name of chalk is  carbonate of lime. It effervesces strongly with an acid.         _Effervesce_, to froth or foam up.         _Deposited_, placed on anything.      Where is Chalk found?    In large beds or strata in the earth. Chalk, on account of its  abundance in England, forms an important feature in the scenery and  geology of that country; it causes the whiteness of its sea-cliffs.  Scotland and Wales are entirely without chalk. The white chalk is  found, with interruptions, over a space above eleven hundred miles  long, extending from the north of Ireland, through England, France,  Belgium, Germany, Poland, and Southern Russia, to the Crimea, with a  breadth of more than eight hundred miles. The Island of Crete, now  called Candia, situated in the Mediterranean, was formerly noted for  its chalk. This substance is very useful in many of the arts and  manufactures.      Where is the Crimea?    The peninsula of the Crimea is a part of Russia, lying on the Black  Sea, by which it is bounded on the west and south.      Are there any other kinds of this earth besides the common white  chalk?    Yes; there are various kinds of chalk, distinguished by their  different colors, as white, black, red, &c., found in various parts of  the world, of great use to the painter, both in oil and water colors,  and for drawing on paper, &c.      What is Marble?    A kind of stone remarkable for its hardness and firm grain, and for  being susceptible of the finest polish. It is dug in great masses from  pits or quarries; and is much used in ornamental buildings, and for  statues, altars, tombs, chimney-pieces, &c. The word is derived from  the French _marbre_, marble. Marble is supposed to be formed, deep  within the bowels of the earth, from a loose and porous carbonate of  lime, subjected to enormous heat and pressure.         _Susceptible_, easily admitting anything additional.         _Porous_, full of holes, or interstices.      Are there different sorts of this Stone?    Marbles are of many different kinds, usually named either from their  color or country; some of one simple color, as white, or black; others  streaked or variegated with different colors. They are classified as  ancient and modern: the ancient are those found in quarries now lost  or inaccessible to us, and of which there are only some wrought pieces  remaining;--the modern, those from quarries still open, and out of  which blocks of marble continue to be taken.      In what countries is Marble found?    The United States, Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,  and many other countries, produce marbles of different colors and  qualities; some more beautiful, valuable, and more highly esteemed  than others, as those of Egypt, Italy, &c. Those, also, of different  places in the same country frequently differ from each other in  quality and appearance Of the European marbles, that of Italy is the  most valuable.      What kind appears to have been held in the greatest esteem by the  ancients?    A beautiful white marble, called the Parian; of which the Grecian  statues were mostly made. By some, it is supposed to have taken its  name from the Isle of Paros, in the Mediterranean; but by others from  Parius, a famous statuary, who made it celebrated by cutting in it a  statue of Venus. Parian marble is often mentioned by ancient authors.         _Statues_, figures of men, animals, &c., cut in stone or       marble.         _Statuary_, one who makes statues.      Who was Venus?    The goddess of love and beauty, who was an object of adoration in the  idolatrous ages, when men ignorantly knelt down and worshipped stocks  and stones, which their own hands had fashioned after the likeness of  things on the earth, or imaginary creations of their fancy;--or,  again, the sun, moon, and stars, instead of the one and only true God.  In those times, every nation had its peculiar deities, to whom were  paid divine rites and honors, and to whose names costly temples were  dedicated: these deities were divided into two classes, superior and  inferior. Venus was one of the Grecian goddesses, supposed by them to  have sprung from the froth of the sea. Kings and celebrated warriors,  and sages too, after death, frequently received divine honors; as  Confucius, the founder of the Chinese empire, who, after death, was  worshipped by that people as a god. Romulus, the first king of Rome,  likewise, was thus adored by the Romans; and many similar instances of  the same species of idolatry amongst other nations might be recorded.         _Deities_, fabulous gods or goddesses.         _Idolatrous_, given to the worship of idols.         _Superior_, higher in rank.         _Inferior_, of a lower rank.         _Sage_, a wise man.          CHAPTER XIV.    GOLD, SILVER, LEAD, TIN, PLATINA, SULPHUR, GEMS OR PRECIOUS  STONES, AS DIAMONDS, RUBIES, EMERALDS, TURQUOIS, PEARLS,  MOTHER-OR-PEARLS, AND IVORY.      What is Gold?    The purest and most precious of metals: it is sometimes found in solid  masses, as in California, Peru, Hungary, &c.; in a shape resembling  the branches of plants; in thin plates covering other bodies, as in  Siberia; sometimes in a crystal form. It, however, generally occurs in  a metallic state, and most commonly in the form of grains.      What is it called when found in a perfect metallic form?    Native gold: it is, however, seldom met with perfectly pure, being  frequently alloyed with silver, copper, iron, or platina; sometimes  concealed in other minerals; from which, if sufficiently abundant, it  is extracted by art.      Where and in what manner is Gold generally found?    All parts of the earth afford gold; though with great difference in  point of purity and abundance. It is chiefly obtained from mines. Many  rivers contain gold in their sands, especially those of California and  Guinea. Gold mines are of rare occurrence in Europe, but the metal is  found in some of its rivers; among its mines, those of Upper Hungary  are the most considerable. China and Japan are rich in this metal;  many parts of Asia also possess it."]]]
