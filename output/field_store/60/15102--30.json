His nature  leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but  the embellishment of his early life, or a song piped in the intervals  of the acts. He seeks for fame, for fortune, for space in the world's  thoughts, and dominion over his fellow-men. But a woman's whole life  is a history of the affections. The heart is her world; it is there  her ambition strives for empire; it is there her ambition seeks for  hidden treasures. She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she  embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked  her case is hopeless, for it is bankruptcy of the heart.    6. WOMAN'S LOVE.--Woman's love is stronger than death; it rises  superior to adversity, and towers in sublime beauty above the  niggardly selfishness of the world. Misfortune cannot suppress it;  enmity cannot alienate it; temptation cannot enslave it. It is  the guardian angel of the nursery and the sick bed; it gives an  affectionate concord to the partnership of life and interest,  circumstances cannot modify it; it ever remains the same to sweeten  existence, to purify the cup of life, on the rugged pathway to the  grave, and melt to moral pliability the brittle nature of man. It is  the ministering spirit of home, hovering in soothing caresses over the  cradle, and the death-bed of the household, and filling up the urn of  all its sacred memories.    7. A LADY'S COMPLEXION.--He who loves a lady's complexion, form and  features, loves not her true self, but her soul's old clothes. The  love that has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers and dies.  The love that is fed with presents always requires feeding. Love, and  love only, is the loan for love. Love is of the nature of a burning  glass, which, kept still in one place, fireth; changed often, it doth  nothing. The purest joy we can experience in one we love, is to see  that person a source of happiness to others. When you are with the  person loved, you have no sense of being bored. This humble and  trivial circumstance is the great test--the only sure and abiding test  of love.    8. TWO SOULS COME TOGETHER.--When two souls come together, each  seeking to magnify the other, each in subordinate sense worshiping  the other, each help the other; the two flying together so that each  wing-beat of the one helps each wing-beat of the other--when two souls  come together thus, they are lovers. They who unitedly move themselves  away from grossness and from earth, toward the throne of crystaline  and the pavement golden, are, indeed, true lovers.

LOVE IS A TONIC AND A REMEDY FOR DISEASE, MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER,  CREATES INDUSTRY, ETC.        \"All thoughts, all passions, all desires.    Whatever stirs this mortal frame,    Are ministers of Love,    And feed his sacred flame.\"      1. It is a physiological fact long demonstrated that persons  possessing a loving disposition borrow less of the cares of life, and  also live much longer than persons with a strong, narrow and selfish  nature. Persons who love scenery, love domestic animals, show great  attachment for all friends; love their home dearly and find interest  and enchantment in almost everything have qualities of mind and heart  which indicate good health and a happy disposition.    2. Persons who love music and are constantly humming or whistling a  tune, are persons that need not be feared, they are kind-hearted  and with few exceptions possess a loving disposition. Very few good  musicians become criminals.    3. Parents that cultivate a love among their children will find  that the same feeling will soon be manifested in their children's  disposition. Sunshine in the hearts of the parents will blossom in the  lives of the children. The parent who continually cherishes a feeling  of dislike and rebellion in his soul, cultivating moral hatred against  his fellow-man, will soon find the same things manifested by his  son. As the son resembles his father in looks so he will to a certain  extent resemble him in character. Love in the heart of the parent  will beget kindness and affection in the heart of a child. Continuous  scolding and fretting in the home will soon make love a stranger.    4. If you desire to cultivate love, create harmony in all your  feelings and faculties. Remember that all that is pure, holy and  virtuous in love flows from the deepest fountain of the human soul.  Poison the fountain and you change virtue to vice, and happiness to  misery.    5. Love strengthens health, and disappointment cultivates disease. A  person in love will invariably enjoy the best of health. Ninety-nine  per cent. of our strong constitutioned men, now in physical ruin, have  wrecked themselves on the breakers of an unnatural love. Nothing but  right love and a right marriage will restore them to health.    6. All men feel much better for going a courting, providing they  court purely. Nothing tears the life out of man more than lust, vulgar  thoughts and immoral conduct. The libertine or harlot has changed  love, God's purest gift to man, into lust. They cannot acquire love in  its purity again, the sacred flame has vanished forever. Love is pure,  and cannot be found in the heart of a seducer.    7. A woman is never so bright and full of health as when deeply in  love. Many sickly and frail women are snatched from the clutches of  some deadly disease and restored to health by falling in love.    8. It is a long established fact that married persons are healthier  than unmarried persons; thus it proves that health and happiness  belong to the home. Health depends upon mind. Love places the mind  into a delightful state and quickens every human function, makes the  blood circulate and weaves threads of joy into cables of domestic  love.    9. An old but true proverb: \"A true man loving one woman will speak  well of all women. A true woman loving one man will speak well of all  men. A good wife praises all men, but praises her husband most. A good  man praises all women, but praises his wife most.\"    10. Persons deeply in love become peculiarly pleasant, winning and  tender. It is said that a musician can never excel or an artist do  his best until he has been deeply in love. A good orator, a great  statesman or great men in general are greater and better for having  once been thoroughly in love. A man who truly loves his wife and home  is always a safe man to trust.    11. Love makes people look younger in years. People in unhappy homes  look older and more worn and fatigued. A woman at thirty, well courted  and well married, looks five or ten years younger than a woman of the  same age unhappily married. Old maids and bachelors always look older  than they are. A flirting widow always looks younger than an old maid  of like age.    12. Love renders women industrious and frugal, and a loving husband  spends lavishly on a loved wife and children, though miserly towards  others.    13. Love cultivates self-respect and produces beauty. Beauty in walk  and beauty in looks; a girl in love is at her best; it brings out  the finest traits of her character, she walks more erect and is more  generous and forgiving; her voice is sweeter and she makes happy all  about her. She works better, sings better and is better.    14. Now in conclusion, a love marriage is the best life insurance  policy; it pays dividends every day, while every other insurance  policy merely promises to pay after death. Remember that statistics  demonstrate that married people outlive old maids and old bachelors by  a goodly number of years and enjoy healthier and happier lives.

MULTIPLYING THE RACE.--Some means for multiplying our race is  necessary to prevent its extinction by death. Propagation and death  appertain to man's earthly existence. If the Deity had seen fit to  bring every member of the human family into being by a direct act of  creative power, without the agency of parents, the present wise and  benevolent arrangements of husbands and wives, parents and  children, friends and neighbors, would have been superseded, and all  opportunities for exercising parental and connubial love, in which  so much enjoyment is taken, cut off. But the domestic feelings and  relations, as now arranged, must strike every philosophical observer  as inimitably beautiful and perfect--as the offspring of infinite  Wisdom and Goodness combined.    2. AMATIVENESS AND ITS COMBINATIONS constitute their origin,  counterpart, and main medium of manifestation. Its primary function  is connubial love. From it, mainly, spring those feelings which  exist between the sexes as such and result in marriage and offspring.  Combined with the higher sentiments, it gives rise to all those  reciprocal kind feelings and nameless courtesies which each sex  manifests towards the other; refining and elevating both, promoting  gentility and politeness, and greatly increasing social and general  happiness.    3. RENDERS MEN MORE POLITE TO WOMEN.--So far from being in the least  gross or indelicate, its proper exercise is pure, chaste, virtuous,  and even an ingredient in good manners. It is this which renders men  always more polite towards women than to one another, and more refined  in their society, and which makes women more kind, grateful, genteel  and tender towards men than women. It makes mothers love their  sons more than their daughters, and fathers more attached to their  daughters.

Being simple and sincere, they do not escape the need for legends;  I might almost say that, being honest, they do not escape the need  for lies.  But their mood is not historic, they do not wish to grapple  with the past; they do not love its complexities; nor do they  understand the enthusiasm for its details and even its doubts.  Now in all this the Moslems of a place like Jerusalem are the very  opposite of the Christians of Jerusalem.  The Christianity of Jerusalem is  highly historic, and cannot be understood without historical imagination.  And this is not the strong point perhaps of those among us who generally  record their impressions of the place.  As the educated Englishman  does not know the history of England, it would be unreasonable  to expect him to know the history of Moab or of Mesopotamia.  He receives the impression, in visiting the shrines of Jerusalem,  of a number of small sects squabbling about small things.  In short, he has before him a tangle of trivialities, which include  the Roman Empire in the West and in the East, the Catholic Church  in its two great divisions, the Jewish race, the memories of Greece  and Egypt, and the whole Mahometan world in Asia and Africa.  It may be that he regards these as small things; but I should be glad  if he would cast his eye over human history, and tell me what are  the large things.  The truth is that the things that meet to-day in  Jerusalem are by far the greatest things that the world has yet seen.  If they are not important nothing on this earth is important,  and certainly not the impressions of those who happen to be bored  by them.  But to understand them it is necessary to have something  which is much commoner in Jerusalem than in Oxford or Boston;  that sort of living history which we call tradition.    For instance, the critic generally begins by dismissing these conflicts  with the statement that they are all about small points of theology.  I do not admit that theological points are small points.  Theology is only  thought applied to religion; and those who prefer a thoughtless religion  need not be so very disdainful of others with a more rationalistic taste.  The old joke that the Greek sects only differed about a single  letter is about the lamest and most illogical joke in the world.  An atheist and a theist only differ by a single letter; yet theologians  are so subtle as to distinguish definitely between the two.  But though I do not in any case allow that it is idle to be concerned  about theology, as a matter of actual fact these quarrels are not  chiefly concerned about theology.  They are concerned about history.  They are concerned with the things about which the only human sort  of history is concerned; great memories of great men, great battles  for great ideas, the love of brave people for beautiful places,  and the faith by which the dead are alive.  It is quite true that with  this historic sense men inherit heavy responsibilities and revenges,  fury and sorrow and shame.  It is also true that without it men die,  and nobody even digs their graves.    The truth is that these quarrels are rather about patriotism than  about religion, in the sense of theology.  That is, they are just such  heroic passions about the past as we call in the West by the name  of nationalism; but they are conditioned by the extraordinarily  complicated position of the nations, or what corresponds to the nations.  We of the West, if we wish to understand it, must imagine ourselves  as left with all our local loves and family memories unchanged,  but the places affected by them intermingled and tumbled about by some  almost inconceivable convulsion.  We must imagine cities and landscapes  to have turned on some unseen pivots, or been shifted about by some  unseen machinery, so that our nearest was furthest and our remotest  enemy our neighbour.  We must imagine monuments on the wrong sites,  and the antiquities of one county emptied out on top of another.  And we must imagine through all this the thin but tough threads  of tradition everywhere tangled and yet everywhere unbroken.  We must picture a new map made out of the broken fragments of the old map;  and yet with every one remembering the old map and ignoring the new.  In short we must try to imagine, or rather we must try to hope,  that our own memories would be as long and our own loyalties  as steady as the memories and loyalties of the little crowd  in Jerusalem; and hope, or pray, that we could only be as rigid,  as rabid and as bigoted as are these benighted people.  Then perhaps we might preserve all our distinctions of truth  and falsehood in a chaos of time and space.    We have to conceive that the Tomb of Napoleon is in the middle  of Stratford-on-Avon, and that the Nelson Column is erected  on the field of Bannockburn; that Westminster Abbey has taken  wings and flown away to the most romantic situation on the Rhine,  and that the wooden \"Victory\" is stranded, like the Ark on Ararat,  on the top of the Hill of Tara; that the pilgrims to the shrine  of Lourdes have to look for it in the Island of Runnymede,  and that the only existing German statue of Bismarck is to be found  in the Pantheon at Paris.  This intolerable topsy-turvydom is no  exaggeration of the way in which stories cut across each other and sites  are imposed on each other in the historic chaos of the Holy City.  Now we in the West are very lucky in having our nations normally  distributed into their native lands; so that good patriots can talk  about themselves without perpetually annoying their neighbours.  Some of the pacifists tell us that national frontiers and divisions  are evil because they exasperate us to war.  It would be far truer  to say that national frontiers and divisions keep us at peace.  It would be far truer to say that we can always love each  other so long as we do not see each other.  But the people  of Jerusalem are doomed to have difference without division.  They are driven to set pillar against pillar in the same temple,  while we can set city against city across the plains of the world.  While for us a church rises from its foundations as naturally  as a flower springs from a flower-bed, they have to bless the soil  and curse the stones that stand on it.  While the land we love  is solid under our feet to the earth's centre, they have to see  all they love and hate lying in strata like alternate night and day,  as incompatible and as inseparable.  Their entanglements are tragic,  but they are not trumpery or accidental.  Everything has a meaning;  they are loyal to great names as men are loyal to great nations;  they have differences about which they feel bound to dispute to the death;  but in their death they are not divided.    Jerusalem is a small town of big things; and the average modern  city is a big town full of small things.  All the most important  and interesting powers in history are here gathered within the area  of a quiet village; and if they are not always friends, at least they  are necessarily neighbours.  This is a point of intellectual interest,  and even intensity, that is far too little realised.  It is a matter  of modern complaint that in a place like Jerusalem the Christian  groups do not always regard each other with Christian feelings.  It is said that they fight each other; but at least they meet each other.  In a great industrial city like London or Liverpool, how often do they  even meet each other?  In a large town men live in small cliques,  which are much narrower than classes; but in this small town they  live at least by large contacts, even if they are conflicts.  Nor is it really true, in the daily humours of human life, that they  are only conflicts.  I have heard an eminent English clergyman from  Cambridge bargaining for a brass lamp with a Syrian of the Greek Church,  and asking the advice of a Franciscan friar who was standing smiling  in the same shop.  I have met the same representative of the Church  of England, at a luncheon party with the wildest Zionist Jews,  and with the Grand Mufti, the head of the Moslem religion.  Suppose the same Englishman had been, as he might well have been,  an eloquent and popular vicar in Chelsea or Hampstead.  How often  would he have met a Franciscan or a Zionist?  Not once in a year.  How often would he have met a Moslem or a Greek Syrian?  Not once  in a lifetime.  Even if he were a bigot, he would be bound  in Jerusalem to become a more interesting kind of bigot.  Even if his opinions were narrow, his experiences would be wide.  He is not, as a fact, a bigot, nor, as a fact, are the other  people bigots, but at the worst they could not be unconscious bigots.  They could not live in such uncorrected complacency as is possible  to a larger social set in a larger social system.  They could not  be quite so ignorant as a broad-minded person in a big suburb.  Indeed there is something fine and distinguished about the very delicacy,  and even irony, of their diplomatic relations.  There is something  of chivalry in the courtesy of their armed truce, and it is a great  school of manners that includes such differences in morals.    This is an aspect of the interest of Jerusalem which can easily  be neglected and is not easy to describe.  The normal life  there is intensely exciting, not because the factions fight,  but rather because they do not fight.  Of the abnormal crisis  when they did fight, and the abnormal motives that made them fight,  I shall have something to say later on.  But it was true for a great  part of the time that what was picturesque and thrilling was not  the war but the peace.  The sensation of being in this little town  is rather like that of being at a great international congress.  It is like that moving and glittering social satire, in which  diplomatists can join in"]]]
