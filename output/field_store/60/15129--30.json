Columbine recoiled from  his look as well as touch.    \"You keep out of this or I'll teach you who's boss here,\" he said,  stridently.    \"You're going too far!\" burst out Columbine.    Meanwhile Wilson had laboriously climbed down out of the wagon, and,  utilizing his crutch, he hobbled to where Belllounds had thrown the  reins, and stooped to pick them up. Belllounds shoved Columbine farther  back, and then he leaped to confront the cowboy.    \"I've got you now, Moore,\" he said, hoarse and low. Stripped of all  pretense, he showed the ungovernable nature of his temper. His face grew  corded and black. The hand he thrust out shook like a leaf. \"You  smooth-tongued liar! I'm on to your game. I know you'd put her against  me. I know you'd try to win her--less than a week before her  wedding-day.... But it's not for that I'm going to beat hell out of you!  It's because I hate you! Ever since I can remember my father held you up  to me! And he sent me to--to--he sent me away because of you. By God!  that's why I hate you!\"    All that was primitive and violent and base came out with strange  frankness in Belllounds's tirade. Only when calm could his mind be  capable of hidden calculation. The devil that was in him now  seemed rampant.    \"Belllounds, you're mighty brave to stack up this way against a  one-legged man,\" declared the cowboy, with biting sarcasm.    \"If you had two club-feet I'd only be the gladder,\" yelled Belllounds,  and swinging his arm, he slapped Moore so that it nearly toppled him  over. Only the injured foot, coming down hard, saved him.    When Columbine saw that, and then how Wilson winced and grew deathly  pale, she uttered a low cry, and she seemed suddenly rooted to the spot,  weak, terrified at what was now inevitable, and growing sick and cold  and faint.    \"It's a damn lucky thing for you I'm not packing a gun,\" said Moore,  grimly. \"But you knew--or you'd never hit me--you coward.\"    \"I'll make you swallow that,\" snarled Belllounds, and this time he swung  his fist, aiming a heavy blow at Moore.    Then the cowboy whirled aloft the heavy crutch. \"If you hit at me again  I'll let out what little brains you've got. God knows that's little  enough!... Belllounds, I'm going to call you to your face--before this  girl your bat-eyed old man means to give you. You're not drunk. You're  only ugly--mean. You've got a chance now to lick me because I'm  crippled. And you're going to make the most of it. Why, you cur, I could  come near licking you with only one leg. But if you touch me again I'll  brain you!... You never were any good. You're no good now. You never  will be anything but Buster Jack--half dotty, selfish as hell,  bull-headed and mean!... And that's the last word I'll ever waste  on you.\"    \"I'll kill you!\" bawled Belllounds, black with fury.    Moore wielded the crutch menacingly, but as he was not steady on his  feet he was at the disadvantage his adversary had calculated upon.  Belllounds ran around the cowboy, and suddenly plunged in to grapple  with him. The crutch descended, but to little purpose. Belllounds's  heavy onslaught threw Moore to the ground. Before he could rise  Belllounds pounced upon him.    Columbine saw all this dazedly. As Wilson fell she closed her eyes,  fighting a faintness that almost overcame her. She heard wrestling,  threshing sounds, and sodden thumps, and a scattering of gravel. These  noises seemed at first distant, then grew closer. As she gazed again  with keener perception, Moore's horse plunged away from the fiercely  struggling forms that had rolled almost under his feet. During the  ensuing moments it was an equal battle so far as Columbine could tell.  Repelled, yet fascinated, she watched. They beat each other, grappled  and rolled over, first one on top, then the other. But the advantage of  being uppermost presently was Belllounds's. Moore was weakening. That  became noticeable more and more after each time he had wrestled and  rolled about. Then Belllounds, getting this position, lay with his  weight upon Moore, holding him down, and at the same time kicking with  all his might. He was aiming to disable the cowboy by kicking the  injured foot. And he was succeeding. Moore let out a strangled cry, and  struggled desperately. But he was held and weighted down. Belllounds  raised up now and, looking backward, he deliberately and furiously  kicked Moore's bandaged foot; once, twice, again and again, until the  straining form under him grew limp. Columbine, slowly freezing with  horror, saw all this. She could not move. She could not scream. She  wanted to rush in and drag Jack off of Wilson, to hurt him, to kill him,  but her muscles were paralyzed. In her agony she could not even look  away. Belllounds got up astride his prostrate adversary and began to  beat him brutally, swinging heavy, sodden blows. His face then was  terrible to see. He meant murder.    Columbine heard approaching voices and the thumping of hasty feet. That  unclamped her cloven tongue. Wildly she screamed. Old Bill Belllounds  appeared, striding off the porch. And the hunter Wade came running  down the path.    \"Dad! he's killing Wilson!\" cried Columbine.    \"Hyar, you devil!\" roared the rancher.    Jack Belllounds got up. Panting, disheveled, with hair ruffled and face  distorted, he was not a pleasant sight for even the father. Moore lay  unconscious, with ghastly, bloody features, and his bandaged foot showed  great splotches of red.    \"My Gawd, son!\" gasped Old Bill. \"You didn't pick on this hyar crippled  boy?\"    The evidence was plain, in Moore's quiet, pathetic form, in the panting,  purple-faced son. Jack Belllounds did not answer. He was in the grip of  a passion that had at last been wholly unleashed and was still  unsatisfied. Yet a malignant and exultant gratification showed in  his face.    \"That--evens us--up, Moore,\" he panted, and stalked away.    By this time Wade reached the cowboy and knelt beside him. Columbine  came running to fall on her knees. The old rancher seemed stricken.    \"Oh--Oh! it was terrible--\" cried Columbine. \"Oh--he's so white--and the  blood--\"    \"Now, lass, that's no way for a woman,\" said Wade, and there was  something in his kind tone, in his look, in his presence, that calmed  Columbine. \"I'll look after Moore. You go get some water an' a towel.\"    Columbine rose to totter into the house. She saw a red stain on the hand  she had laid upon the cowboy's face, and with a strange, hot, bursting  sensation, strong and thrilling, she put that red place to her lips.  Running out with the things required by Wade, she was in time to hear  the rancher say, \"Looks hurt bad, to me.\"    \"Yes, I reckon,\" replied Wade.    While Columbine held Moore's head upon her lap the hunter bathed the  bloody face. It was battered and bruised and cut, and in some places, as  fast as Wade washed away the red, it welled out again.    Columbine watched that quiet face, while her heart throbbed and swelled  with emotions wholly beyond her control and understanding. When at last  Wilson opened his eyes, fluttering at first, and then wide, she felt a  surge that shook her whole body. He smiled wanly at her, and at Wade,  and then his gaze lifted to Belllounds.    \"I guess--he licked me,\" he said, in weak voice. \"He kept kicking my  sore foot--till I fainted. But he licked me--all right.\"    \"Wils, mebbe he did lick you,\" replied the old rancher, brokenly, \"but  I reckon he's damn little to be proud of--lickin' a crippled  man--thet way.\"    \"Boss, Jack'd been drinking,\" said Moore, weakly. \"And he sure had--some  excuse for going off his head. He caught me--talking sweet to  Columbine ... and then--I called him all the names--I could lay my  tongue to.\"    \"Ahuh!\" The old man seemed at a loss for words, and presently he turned  away, sagging in the shoulders, and plodded into the house.    The cowboy, supported by Wade on one side, with Columbine on the other,  was helped to an upright position, and with considerable difficulty was  gotten into the wagon. He tried to sit up, but made a sorry showing  of it.    \"I'll drive him home an' look after him,\" said Wade. \"Now, Miss Collie,  you're upset, which ain't no wonder. But now you brace. It might have  been worse. Just you go to your room till you're sure of  yourself again.\"    Moore smiled another wan smile at her. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.    \"What for? Me?\" she asked.    \"I mean I'm sorry I was so infernal unlucky--running into you--and  bringing all this distress--to you. It was my fault. If I'd only  kept--my mouth shut!\"    \"You need not be sorry you met me,\" she said, with her eyes straight  upon his. \"I'm glad.... But oh! if your foot is badly hurt I'll  never--never--'    \"Don't say it,\" interrupted Wilson.    \"Lass, you're bent on doin' somethin',\" said Wade, in his gentle voice.    \"Bent?\" she echoed, with something deep and rich in her voice. \"Yes, I'm  bent--_bent_ like your name--to speak my mind!\"    Then she ran toward the house and up on the porch, to enter the  living-room with heaving breast and flashing eyes. Manifestly the  rancher was berating his son. The former gaped at sight of her and the  latter shrank.    \"Jack Belllounds,\" she cried, \"you're not half a man.... You're a coward  and a brute!\"    One tense moment she stood there, lightning scorn and passion in her  gaze, and then she rushed out, impetuously, as she had come.        CHAPTER VIII    Columbine did not leave her room any more that day. What she suffered  there she did not want any one to know. What it cost her to conquer  herself again she had only a faint conception of. She did conquer,  however, and that night made up the sleep she had lost the night before.    Strangely enough, she did not feel afraid to face the rancher and his  son. Recent happenings had not only changed her, but had seemed to give  her strength. When she presented herself at the breakfast-table Jack was  absent."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#20)"],[1,"the difference of vices and virtues to be seen; and  will have us learn that God is wise, just, true, chaste. God's goodness  also to mankind is beheld, because by this means he preserves the  society of men, and therefore he preserves it that thence the Church may  be gathered, and will have polities to be the Church's inns. Of these  divine and immoveable laws, which are testimonies of God, and the chief  rule of manners, the magistrate is to be keeper in punishing all that  violate them. For the voice of the law, without punishment and  execution, is of small avail to bridle and restrain men; therefore it is  said by Paul, _The power should be a terror to evil works, and an honor  to the good._ And antiquity rightly said, _The magistrate is the keeper  of the law, both of the first and second table,_ so far as appertains to  _good order_. And though many in their governments neglect the glory of  God, yet this ought to be their chief care, to hear and embrace the true  doctrine touching the Son of God, and to foster the churches, as the  psalm saith, _And now understand, ye kings, and be instructed, ye judges  of the earth._ Again, _Open your gates, ye princes_, i.e., Open your  empires to the gospel, and afford harbor to the Son of God. And Isa.  xlix.: _And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and queens_, i.e.,  commonwealths, _shall be thy nursing-mothers_, i.e., of the Church, they  shall afford lodgings to churches and pious studies. And kings and  princes themselves shall be members of the Church, and shall rightly  understand doctrine, shall not help those that establish false doctrine,  and exercise unjust cruelty, but shall be mindful of this saying, \"I  will glorify them that glorify me.\" And Daniel exhorteth the king of  Babylon unto the acknowledgment of God's wrath, and to clemency towards  the exiled Church, when he saith, \"Break off thy sins by righteousness,  and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.\" And since they are  among the chief members of the Church, they should see that judgment be  rightly exercised in the Church, as Constantine, Theodosius, Arcadius,  Marcianus, Charles the Great, and many pious kings, took care that the  judgments of the Church should be rightly exercised, &c.    Thus those of the presbyterian judgment are willing to give to Caesar  those things that are Caesar's, even about matters of religion, that the  magistrate may see, it is far from their intention in the least degree  to intrench upon his just power, by asserting the spiritual power, which  Christ hath seated in his church officers, distinct from the  magistratical power: but as for them of the independent judgment, and  their adherents, they divest the magistrate of such power.[31]      SECTION II.    II. Some power on the other hand touching religion and church affairs,  is utterly denied to the civil magistrate, as no way belonging to him at  all by virtue of his office of magistracy. Take it thus:    Jesus Christ, our Mediator, now under the New Testament, hath committed  no spiritual power at all, magisterial or ministerial, properly,  internally, formally, or virtually ecclesiastical, nor any exercise  thereof, for the government of his Church, to the political magistrate,  heathen or Christian, as the subject or receptacle thereof by virtue of  his magistratical office.    For explication hereof briefly thus: 1. What is meant by  spiritual power, magisterial and ministerial, is laid down in the  general nature of the government, Chap. III. And, That all magisterial  lordly power over the Church, belongs peculiarly and only to Jesus  Christ our Mediator, Lord of all, is proved, Chap. V. Consequently, the  civil magistrate can challenge no such power, without usurpation upon  Christ's prerogative. We hence condemn the Pope as Antichrist, while he  claims to be Christ's vicar-general over Christ's visible Church on  earth. So that all the question here will be about the ministerial  power, whether any such belong to the civil magistrate. 2. What is meant  by power, properly, internally, formally, or virtually ecclesiastical?  Thus conceive: These several terms are purposely used, the more clearly  and fully to distinguish power purely ecclesiastical, which is denied to  the magistrate, from power purely political about ecclesiastical  objects, which is granted to him; which is called ecclesiastical, not  properly, but improperly; not internally, but externally; not formally,  but only objectively, as conversant about ecclesiastical objects. Nor  hath he any such ecclesiastical power in him virtually, i.e. so as to  convey and give it to any other under him. He may grant and protect the  public exercise of that power within his dominions; but designation of  particular persons to the office and power, is from the Church; the  donation of the office and power only from Christ himself. So that  magistracy doth not formally nor virtually comprehend in it  ecclesiastical power for church government; for a magistrate, as a  magistrate, hath no inward ecclesiastical power at all belonging to him.    For confirmation of this proposition, consider these ensuing arguments.    _Argum_. 1st. The keys of the kingdom of heaven were never given by  Christ to the civil magistrate, as such: therefore he cannot be the  proper subject of church government as a magistrate. We may thus reason:    _Major_. No power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven was ever given by  Christ to the civil magistrate, as a magistrate.    _Minor_. But all formal power of church government is at least part of  the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven.    _Conclusion_. Therefore no formal power of church government was ever  given by Christ to the civil magistrate, as a magistrate.    The major proposition is evident.    1. Because when Christ gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven, he makes  no mention at all of the civil magistrate directly or indirectly,  expressly or implicitly, as the recipient subject thereof. Compare Matt.  xvi. 19, and xviii. 18, John ii. 21-23, with Matt. xxvii. 18-20. 2.  Because, in Christ's giving the keys of the kingdom of heaven, he makes  express mention of church officers,[32] which are really and essentially  different from the civil magistrate, viz. of Peter, in name of all the  rest, Matt. xvi. 18, 19, and of the rest of the apostles as the  receptacle of the keys with him, Matt. xviii. 18, all the disciples save  Thomas being together, he gave them the same commission in other words,  John xx. 20-24, and Matt. xxviii. 18-20. Now if Christ should have given  the keys, or any power thereof to the magistrate, as a magistrate, he  must consequently have given them only to the magistrate, and then how  could he have given them to his apostles, being officers in the Church  really distinct from the magistrate?    3. Because Jesus Christ, in giving the keys of the kingdom, gave not any  one sort, act, part, or piece of the keys severally, but the whole power  of the keys, all the sorts and acts thereof jointly. Therefore it is  said, _I give the keys of the kingdom_--and _whatsoever thou shalt  bind--whatsoever thou shalt loose--whose soever sins ye remit--whose  soever sins ye retain_--Matt. xvi. 19, John xx. 23. So that here is not  only key, but keys given at once, viz. key of doctrine, and the key of  discipline; or the key of order, and the key of jurisdiction; not only  binding or retaining, but loosing or remitting of sins, viz. all acts  together conferred in the keys. Now if Christ gave the keys to the  magistrate, then he gave all the sorts of keys and all the acts thereof  to him: if so, the magistrate may as well preach the word, and dispense  the sacraments, &c., (as Erastus would have him,) as dispense the  censures, &c., (for Christ joined all together in the same commission,  and by what warrant are they disjoined?) and if so, what need of  pastors, teachers, &c.,, in the Church? Let the civil magistrate do all.  It is true, the ruling elder (which was after added) is limited only to  one of the keys, viz. the _key of discipline_, 1 Tim. v. 17; but this  limitation is by the same authority that ordained his office.    4. Because if Christ gave the keys to the civil magistrate as such, then  to every magistrate, whether Jewish, heathenish, or Christian: but not  to the Jewish magistrate; for the sceptre was to depart from him, and  the Jewish polity to be dissolved, and even then was almost extinct. Not  to the heathenish magistrate, for then those might be properly and  formally church governors which were not church members; and if the  heathen magistrate refused to govern the Church, (when there was no  other magistrate on earth,) she must be utterly destitute of all  government, which are grossly absurd. Nor, finally, to the Christian  magistrate, for Christ gave the keys to officers then in being; but at  that time no Christian magistrate was in being in the world. Therefore  the keys were given by Christ to no civil magistrate, as such, at all.    The minor, viz. But all formal power of church government is at least  part of the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven is clear. If we  take church government largely, as containing both doctrine, worship,  and discipline, it is the whole power of the keys; if strictly, as  restrained only to discipline, it is at least part of the power. For,  1st, Not only the power of order, but also the power of jurisdiction, is  contained under the word keys; otherwise it should have been said key,  not keys; church government therefore is at least part of the power of  the keys. 2d, The word key, noting a stewardly power, as appears, Isa.  xxii. 22, (as Erastians themselves will easily grant,) may as justly be  extended in the nature of it to signify the ruling power by  jurisdiction, as the teaching power by doctrine; in that the office of a  steward in the household, who bears the keys, consists in governing,  ordering,"]]]
