But the fact was  that he had been so cowed by his beating that he was afraid to openly  attack her, lest she should get Nanahboozhoo to help her again and it might  be worse for him than it was at his first meeting. But he treasured up  revengeful feelings in his heart and resolved that at some time or other he  would dreadfully punish her.    \"Some years passed by, and the older children, next to Waubenoo, were able  to do most of the hunting and fishing as well as to be on guard against  any of the evil doings of Gray Wolf. Thus they were able, in a measure, to  repay their sister, whom they dearly loved, although they were so  thoughtless, for all her great kindness to them.    \"One fall there came to the village a splendid Indian hunter. He was of the  same tribe, but lived with his people, most of the time, at a distant part  of the country. He was so pleased with this village, where dwelt Waubenoo,  that he decided to remain for the winter and hunt. He was such a very  pleasant fellow and such a great hunter that he soon made many friends.  Gray Wolf was the only man who seemed to hate him, and he was even so rash  as to insult him openly in an Indian gathering.    \"Soquaatum, for this was the young warrior's name, stood the insults of  Gray Wolf for some time, then, when he saw that some of the young hunters  began to think he was afraid of Gray Wolf, he suddenly sprang at him and  knocked him down, and then seizing him by his belt, he shook him as easily  and thoroughly as a wildcat would a rabbit. Then he threw him from him and  sat down among the people as though nothing had happened.    \"That evening, when he and the relatives with whom he lived were seated  around the fire in the wigwam, he heard for the first time the story of  Waubenoo: of her great industry, her love for her little brothers and  sisters, and how she had been threatened by Gray Wolf and then befriended  by Nanahboozhoo.    \"This story very much interested Soquaatum, and especially as in his  hunting he had met her younger brother, now a fine strapping hunter, and  had become very fond of him, although he was much younger. So he resolved  that as soon as he could he would visit her wigwam and seek her  acquaintance.\"    \"Ho! Ho! So this is to be a love story,\" said Sagastao.    \"Be quiet, do,\" said his sister. \"All love stories do not end well.  Remember, there was Gray Wolf!\"    Souwanas profited by the interruption, for it gave him an opportunity to  light his pipe with flint and steel, and he then resumed the story.    \"Soon after Soquaatum arrayed himself in his most attractive costume and  called at the tent of Waubenoo. His excuse was that he wanted to see her  brother and arrange some hunting excursion.    \"Waubenoo, who had often heard her brother speak of his great skill as a  hunter, and had also heard how easily and thoroughly he had handled Gray  Wolf, received him most kindly and at once made him welcome.    \"Well, it is not surprising that he should soon fall in love with Waubenoo,  and so pleased was she with his manner, as well as his attractive  appearance, that she became very fond of him, and it was not many days  after their first meeting before it was noised abroad that Soquaatum and  Waubenoo were lovers.    \"Soquaatum remained until about the middle of the winter. Then he returned  to his distant home to make all preparations for receiving his wife, for  whom he was to come in the spring.    \"Gray Wolf was, of course, furious when he heard that Waubenoo was to be  married, and to the man who had humiliated him in the presence of so many  people. Though angry and revengeful, he was at heart a cowardly fellow, and  now that Waubenoo's brother was full-grown he was afraid of him, as well as  of Soquaatum while he was in the neighborhood. But his fears did not  prevent him from thinking of schemes for revenge which, however, came to  nothing, because the friends of Waubenoo were so vigilant and well  prepared.    \"At length one of his plans succeeded, and this is how it happened:    \"Gray Wolf enlisted a young Indian who was equally bad with himself to help  him. As Soquaatum had now been gone for some weeks to his home, which was  far east from that region, Gray Wolf and his wicked companion went a good  long distance--many miles--in that direction. There they made a hunting  lodge and laid their plans to capture Waubenoo. Then Gray Wolf's companion  went back and remained secreted near the wigwam of Waubenoo. One night he  saw her two brothers leave, about midnight, for some distant traps that  would take them all day to reach.    \"As soon as this bad fellow was satisfied that they were well out of sight  and hearing he rushed up to the tent of Waubenoo and hastily aroused her  from her sleep. He had arrayed himself as though he was gaining on her,  she began calling: 'Soquaatum! Soquaatum!' Alas! he was far away, but there  was another who, fortunately, was near. Nanahboozhoo had been out hunting  and he had a sled which he was dragging, loaded with game. He was surprised  as he heard this calling, 'Soquaatum! Soquaatum!' and as he continued  listening it became hoarse and then only like a whisper. He could stand it  no longer; he rushed through the woods and there he saw Waubenoo, dashing  along on snow-shoes, calling in a low whisper: 'Soquaatum! Soquaatum!'  while not a hundred feet behind her was Gray Wolf, yelling in triumph that  he would soon capture her. Unfortunately Nanahboozhoo was not in a very  good humor that day. He had heard of some little children that had been  tattling about him, and he had heard that the children in the tent of  Waubenoo had told about his visit.    \"However, when he saw who it was that was in danger, and heard her cry to  him for help when she saw him, and especially when he saw who it was that  was after her, he quickly turned Waubenoo into a bird and without any  trouble she quickly flew up into a tree out of the reach of danger.    \"Ever since that Waubenoo has been the Whisky Jack, and if you will listen  to Whisky Jack when he is not scolding or clamoring at your camp for food  his voice is like that of the lost Indian maiden, with a bad cold, calling  for her lover.\"    \"What did Nanahboozhoo do to Gray Wolf?\" said Sagastao.    \"Hush,\" said Minnehaha. \"Don't you know Nanahboozhoo doesn't like to have  children talk about him?\"    This excessive caution on the part of the little girl vastly amused  Souwanas. Then he told them that Nanahboozhoo turned Gray Wolf into a dog  and made him draw home his heavy load of meat.          CHAPTER XV.      A Novel Race: the Wolverine and the Rock--How the  Wolverine's Legs were Shortened--A Punishment for  Conceit.    There was great excitement one morning among the children in the schoolroom  when Mary came in with the word that some hunters with their dog sleds had  called, and that they had with them a great wolverine which had been killed  in the woods not very far away. The children ran out to look at it.    Now the wolverine is known to be such a cunning, clever animal that the  killing of one is quite an event among the Indians, and the lucky hunter  who succeeds in destroying one is the hero of the hour. A man may on one  hunting trip kill several bears or wolves, or many other animals, and there  is not much said about it, but to kill a wolverine, that pest and scourge  of the hunters, is indeed a feat that any man is proud of.    \"Why is it called a wolverine?\" asked Sagastao.    \"Because it was once like a wolf, and had small feet and long legs, but now  its legs are short and its feet are very large.\"    \"What shortened its legs and made its feet become so large?\" asked  Sagastao.    It was too cold a day to remain any longer outside looking at the  wolverine, or to learn more about it, so the children were obliged to  return to their warm schoolroom, where their lessons were resumed.    It was evident, however, that both Sagastao and Minnehaha were ready with a  couple of questions for Mary, and it was not long after school hours that  they sought her and asked:    \"Mary, what was it that shortened the legs of the wolverine? and what made  his feet so big?\"    \"The wolverine,\" replied Mary, \"was once the finest of all the different  kinds of wolves. He had the softest and nicest of fur. His legs were long,  and his feet were firm and handsome, but he was an awfully conceited  fellow. He fancied he was the handsomest creature in existence and looked  down with contempt on all the other kinds of wolves. He used to go to the  side of the clear transparent lake, where he could see his shadow reflected  in the water, and he would strut up and down and say: 'O dear, what a  lovely creature I am!'    \"It is true he was very clever in many ways. He was so swift that he could  run down even the antelope and the elk, and at all the great animal  gatherings, where the different creatures met in council, he was the  swiftest there, and easily won the chief prizes at the great races which  the animals used to hold. Indeed, he won so many races that at length he  could get no animal to compete with him. He even tried to get up races with  the birds, but they laughed at him for his conceit.    \"One day he happened to be hunting among the mountains. Near the top of  one he saw a large ball-like rock, standing there apart from the other big  rocks. Coming up close to this great round rock he said to it:    \"'Was that you I saw walking just now?'    \"'No; I cannot walk, I have lain here for a long time,' said the rock.    \"The wolverine retorted that he was sure he had seen the rock walking.    \"This made the rock angry and he told the wolverine that he was telling a  falsehood. Then the saucy wolverine replied:    \"'You need not speak to me in that way, for I have seen you walking.'    \"Then the wolverine ran off a little distance and challenged the rock to  catch him. But the rock did not reply"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10956"],[0,"Indian speeches (1907-1909) (#20)"],[1,"  that--        \"For the future, fitness is to be the criterion of eligibility.\"    I need not quote the famous paragraph in the Queen's Proclamation of  1858. Every Member of the House who takes an interest in India, knows  that by heart. Now, the noble Marquess says that his anxiety is that  nothing shall be done to impair the efficiency of the Viceroy's  Council. I share that anxiety with all my heart. I hope the noble  Marquess will do me the justice to remember that in these plans I have  gone beyond the Government of India, in resolving that a permanent  official majority shall remain in the Viceroy's Council. Lord  MacDonnell said the other day:--        \"I believe you cannot find any individual native gentleman who is      enjoying general confidence, who would be able to give advice and      assistance to the Governor-General in Council.\"    Well, for that matter, it has been my lot twice to fill the not very  exhilarating post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, and I do not believe  I can truly say I ever met in Ireland a single individual native  gentleman who \"enjoyed general confidence.\" And yet I received at  Dublin Castle most excellent and competent advice. Therefore I am not  much impressed by that argument. The question is whether there is no  one of the 300 millions of the population of India, who is competent  to be the officially-constituted adviser of the Governor-General in  Council in the administration of Indian affairs. You make an Indian  a judge of the High Court, and Indians have even been acting Chief  Justices. As to capacity, who can deny that they have distinguished  themselves as administrators of native States, where a very full  demand is made on their resources, intellectual and moral? It is said  that the presence of an Indian member would cause restraint in the  language of discussion. For a year and a half we have had two Indians  on the Council of India, and we have none of us ever found the  slightest restraint.    Then there is the question, What are you going to do about the Hindu  and the Mahomedan? When Indians were first admitted to the High  Courts, for a long time the Hindus were more fit and competent than  the Mahomedans; but now I am told the Mahomedans have their full  share. The same sort of operation would go on in quinquennial periods  in respect of the Viceroy's Council. Opinion amongst the great  Anglo-Indian officers now at home is divided, but I know at least one,  not at all behind Lord MacDonnell in experience or mental grasp, who  is strongly in favour of this proposal. One circumstance that cannot  but strike your Lordships as remarkable, is the comparative absence of  hostile criticism of this idea by the Anglo-Indian Press, and, as I  am told, in Calcutta society. I was apprehensive at one time that it  might be otherwise. I should like to give a concrete illustration of  my case. The noble Marquess opposite said the other day that there was  going to be a vacancy in one of the posts on the Viceroy's Executive  Council--that is, the legal member's time would soon be up. Now,  suppose there were in Calcutta an Indian lawyer of large practice and  great experience in his profession--a man of unstained professional  and personal repute, in close touch with European society, and much  respected, and the actual holder of important legal office. Am I to  say to this man--\"In spite of all these excellent circumstances to  your credit; in spite of your undisputed fitness; in spite of the  emphatic declaration of 1833 that fitness is to be the criterion  of eligibility; in spite of the noble promise in Queen Victoria's  Proclamation of 1858--a promise of which every Englishman ought to be  for ever proud if he tries to adhere to it, and ashamed if he tries to  betray or to mock it--in spite of all this, usage and prejudice are  so strong, that I dare not appoint you, but must instead fish up a  stranger to India from Lincoln's Inn or the Temple?\" Is there one of  your Lordships who would envy the Secretary of State, who had to hold  language of that kind to a meritorious candidate, one of the King's  equal subjects? I press it on your Lordships in that concrete way.  Abstract general arguments are slippery. I do not say there is no  force in them, but there are deeper questions at issue to which both I  and the Governor-General attach the greatest importance. My Lords, I  thank you for your attention, and I beg to move the Second Reading.          VIII      INDIAN PROBATIONERS    (OXFORD. JUNE 13, 1909)    [The Vice Chancellor of Oxford University and the teachers of the  Indian Civil Service probationers gave a dinner to the probationers  on Saturday at the New Masonic Hall, Oxford, to meet the Secretary of  State for India. The Vice Chancellor was in the chair]    It is a great honour that it should fall to me to be the first  Secretary of State to address this body of probationers and others.  Personally I am always delighted at any reason, good or bad, that  brings me to Oxford. A great deal of Cherwell water has flowed under  Magdalen Bridge, since I was an undergraduate here, and I have a  feeling of nostalgia, when I think of Oxford and come to Oxford. The  reminiscences of one's younger days are apt to have in older times an  ironical tinge, but that is not for any of you to-day to consider. I  am glad to know that of the fifty odd members of the Civil Service who  are going out this autumn, not less than half are Oxford men, nearly  all of them, Oxford bred, and even the three or four who are not  Oxford bred, are practically, so far as can be, Oxford men. Now I will  go a little wider. An Indian Minister is rather isolated in the  public eye, amid the press and bustle of the political energies,  perplexities, interests, and partisan passions that stir and  concentrate attention on our own home affairs. Yet let me assure you  that there is no ordinary compensation for that isolation in the  breast of an Indian Minister. He finds the richest compensation in  the enormous magnitude and endless variety of all the vast field of  interests, present and still more future, that are committed to his  temporary charge. Though his charge may be temporary, I should think  every Secretary of State remembers that even in that fugitive span he  may either do some good or, if he is unhappy, he may do much harm.    This week London has been enormously excited by the Imperial Press  Conference. I was rather struck by the extraordinarily small  attention, almost amounting to nothing, that was given to the Dominion  that you here are concerned with. No doubt an Imperial Conference  raises one or two very delicate questions, as to whether common  citizenship is to be observed, or whether the relations between India  and the Colonies should remain what they are. I am not going to  expatiate upon that to-night, but it did occur to me in reading all  these proceedings that the part of Hamlet was rather omitted, because  India after all is the only real Empire. You there have an immense  Dominion, an almost countless population, governed by foreign rulers.  That is what constitutes an Empire. I observed it all with a rather  grim feeling in my mind, that, if anything goes wrong in India, the  whole of what we are talking about now, the material and military  conditions of the Empire as a whole, might be strangely altered and  convulsed. One of the happy qualities of youth--and there is no  pleasure greater than to see you in that blissful stage, for one who  has passed beyond, long beyond it--is not to be, I think I am right,  in a hurry, not to be too anxious either for the present or future  measure of the responsibilities of life and a career. You will forgive  me if I remind you of what I am sure you all know--that the civil  government of 230,000,000 persons in British India is in the hands of  some 1,200 men who belong to the Indian Civil Service. Let us follow  that. Any member of a body so small must be rapidly placed in a  position of command, and it is almost startling to me, when I look  round on the fresh physiognomies of those who are going out, and the  not less fresh physiognomies of those who have returned, to think of  the contrast between your position, and that, we will say, of some of  your Oxford contemporaries who are lawyers, and who have to spend ever  so many years in chambers in Lincoln's Inn or the Temple waiting for  briefs that do not come. Contrast your position with that of members  who enter the Home Civil Service, an admirable phalanx; but still for  a very long time a member who enters that service has to pursue the  minor and slightly mechanical routine of Whitehall. You will not  misunderstand me, because nobody knows better than a Minister how  tremendous is the debt that he owes to the permanent officials of  his department. Certainly I have every reason to be the last man to  underrate that. Well, any of you may be rapidly placed in a position  of real command with inexorable responsibilities. I am speaking in the  presence of men who know better than I do, all the details, but it  is true that one of you in a few years may be placed in command of a  district and have 1,000,000 human beings committed to his charge. He  may have to deal with a famine; he may have to deal with a riot; he  may take a decision on which the lives of thousands of people may  depend. Well, I think that early call to responsibility, to a display  of energy, to the exercise of individual decision and judgment is what  makes the Indian Civil Service a grand career. And that is what  has produced an extraordinary proportion of remarkable men in that  service.    There is another elevating thought, that I should suppose is present  to all of you. To those who are already in important posts and those  who are by-and-by going to take them up. The good name of England is  in your keeping.
