Some, perhaps,  may think the sense of seeing doth furnish them with the idea of pure  space; but it is plain from what we have elsewhere shown, that the ideas  of space and distance are not obtained by that sense. See the Essay  concerning Vision.    117. What is here laid down seems to put an end to all those disputes and  difficulties that have sprung up amongst the learned concerning the  nature of pure Space. But the chief advantage arising from it is that we  are freed from that dangerous dilemma, to which several who have employed  their thoughts on that subject imagine themselves reduced, to wit, of  thinking either that Real Space is God, or else that there is something  beside God which is eternal, uncreated, infinite, indivisible, immutable.  Both which may justly be thought pernicious and absurd notions. It is  certain that not a few divines, as well as philosophers of great note,  have, from the difficulty they found in conceiving either limits or  annihilation of space, concluded it must be divine. And some of late have  set themselves particularly to show the incommunicable attributes of God  agree to it. Which doctrine, how unworthy soever it may seem of the  Divine Nature, yet I do not see how we can get clear of it, so long as we  adhere to the received opinions.    118. THE ERRORS ARISING FROM THE DOCTRINES OF ABSTRACTION AND EXTERNAL  MATERIAL EXISTENCES, INFLUENCE MATHEMATICAL REASONINGS.--Hitherto of  Natural Philosophy: we come now to make some inquiry concerning  that other great branch of speculative knowledge, to wit, Mathematics.  These, how celebrated soever they may be for their clearness and  certainty of demonstration, which is hardly anywhere else to be  found, cannot nevertheless be supposed altogether free from mistakes, if  in their principles there lurks some secret error which is common to the  professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind. Mathematicians,  though they deduce their theorems from a great height of evidence, yet  their first principles are limited by the consideration of quantity: and  they do not ascend into any inquiry concerning those transcendental  maxims which influence all the particular sciences, each part whereof,  Mathematics not excepted, does consequently participate of the errors  involved in them. That the principles laid down by mathematicians are  true, and their way of deduction from those principles clear and  incontestible, we do not deny; but, we hold there may be certain  erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of Mathematics, and  for that reason not expressly mentioned, though tacitly supposed  throughout the whole progress of that science; and that the ill effects  of those secret unexamined errors are diffused through all the branches  thereof. To be plain, we suspect the mathematicians are as well as other  men concerned in the errors arising from the doctrine of abstract general  ideas, and the existence of objects without the mind.    119. Arithmetic has been thought to have for its object abstract ideas of  Number; of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes, is  supposed no mean part of speculative knowledge. The opinion of the pure  and intellectual nature of numbers in abstract has made them in esteem  with those philosophers who seem to have affected an uncommon fineness  and elevation of thought. It has set a price on the most trifling  numerical speculations which in practice are of no use, but serve only  for amusement; and has therefore so far infected the minds of some, that  they have dreamed of mighty mysteries involved in numbers, and attempted  the explication of natural things by them. But, if we inquire into our  own thoughts, and consider what has been premised, we may perhaps  entertain a low opinion of those high flights and abstractions, and look  on all inquiries, about numbers only as so many difficiles nugae, so far  as they are not subservient to practice, and promote the benefit of life.    120. Unity in abstract we have before considered in sect. 13, from which  and what has been said in the Introduction, it plainly follows there is  not any such idea. But, number being defined a \"collection of units,\" we  may conclude that, if there be no such thing as unity or unit in  abstract, there are no ideas of number in abstract denoted by the numeral  names and figures. The theories therefore in Arithmetic, if they are  abstracted from the names and figures, as likewise from all use and  practice, as well as from the particular things numbered, can be supposed  to have nothing at all for their object; hence we may see how entirely  the science of numbers is subordinate to practice, and how jejune and  trifling it becomes when considered as a matter of mere speculation.    121. However, since there may be some who, deluded by the specious show  of discovering abstracted verities, waste their time in arithmetical  theorems and problems which have not any use, it will not be amiss if we  more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence; and this will  plainly appear by taking a view of Arithmetic in its infancy, and  observing what it was that originally put men on the study of that  science, and to what scope they directed it. It is natural to think that  at first, men, for ease of memory and help of computation, made use of  counters, or in writing of single strokes, points, or the like, each  whereof was made to signify an unit, i.e., some one thing of whatever  kind they had occasion to reckon. Afterwards they found out the more  compendious ways of making one character stand in place of several  strokes or points. And, lastly, the notation of the Arabians or Indians  came into use, wherein, by the repetition of a few characters or figures,  and varying the signification of each figure according to the place it  obtains, all numbers may be most aptly expressed; which seems to have  been done in imitation of language, so that an exact analogy is observed  betwixt the notation by figures and names, the nine simple figures  answering the nine first numeral names and places in the former,  corresponding to denominations in the latter. And agreeably to those  conditions of the simple and local value of figures, were contrived  methods of finding, from the given figures or marks of the parts, what  figures and how placed are proper to denote the whole, or vice versa. And  having found the sought figures, the same rule or analogy being observed  throughout, it is easy to read them into words; and so the number becomes  perfectly known. For then the number of any particular things is said to  be known, when we know the name of figures (with their due arrangement)  that according to the standing analogy belong to them. For, these signs  being known, we can by the operations of arithmetic know the signs of any  part of the particular sums signified by them; and, thus computing in  signs (because of the connexion established betwixt them and the distinct  multitudes of things whereof one is taken for an unit), we may be able  rightly to sum up, divide, and proportion the things themselves that we  intend to number.    122. In Arithmetic, therefore, we regard not the things, but the signs,  which nevertheless are not regarded for their own sake, but because they  direct us how to act with relation to things, and dispose rightly of  them. Now, agreeably to what we have before observed of words in general  (sect. 19, Introd.) it happens here likewise that abstract ideas are  thought to be signified by numeral names or characters, while they do not  suggest ideas of particular things to our minds. I shall not at present  enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject, but only  observe that it is evident from what has been said, those things which  pass for abstract truths and theorems concerning numbers, are in reality  conversant about no object distinct from particular numeral things,  except only names and characters, which originally came to be considered  on no other account but their being signs, or capable to represent aptly  whatever particular things men had need to compute. Whence it follows  that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise, and to as  good purpose as if a man, neglecting the true use or original intention  and subserviency of language, should spend his time in impertinent  criticisms upon words, or reasonings and controversies purely verbal.    123. From numbers we proceed to speak of Extension, which, considered as  relative, is the object of Geometry. The infinite divisibility of finite  extension, though it is not expressly laid down either as an axiom or  theorem in the elements of that science, yet is throughout the same  everywhere supposed and thought to have so inseparable and essential a  connexion with the principles and demonstrations in Geometry, that  mathematicians never admit it into doubt, or make the least question of  it. And, as this notion is the source from whence do spring all those  amusing geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the  plain common sense of mankind, and are admitted with so much reluctance  into a mind not yet debauched by learning; so it is the principal  occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which renders the study of  Mathematics so difficult and tedious. Hence, if we can make it appear  that no finite extension contains innumerable parts, or is infinitely  divisible, it follows that we shall at once clear the science of Geometry  from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever  been esteemed a reproach to human reason, and withal make the attainment  thereof a business of much less time and pains than it hitherto has been.    124. Every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object  of our thought is an idea existing only in the mind, and consequently  each part thereof must be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#18)"],[1,"vulgar those for real things which are perceived by the senses?    HYL.  For the present, I have no inclination to the answering part. I  would much rather see how you can get over what follows. Pray are not the  objects perceived by the SENSES of one, likewise perceivable to  others present? If there were a hundred more here, they would all see the  garden, the trees, and flowers, as I see them. But they are not in the  same manner affected with the ideas I frame in my IMAGINATION. Does not  this make a difference between the former sort of objects and the latter?    PHIL.  I grant it does. Nor have I ever denied a difference between the  objects of sense and those of imagination. But what would you infer from  thence? You cannot say that sensible objects exist unperceived, because  they are perceived by many.    HYL.  I own I can make nothing of that objection: but it hath led me  into another. Is it not your opinion that by our senses we perceive only  the ideas existing in our minds?    PHIL.  It is.    HYL.  But the SAME idea which is in my mind cannot be in yours, or in  any other mind. Doth it not therefore follow, from your principles, that  no two can see the same thing? And is not this highly, absurd?    PHIL.  If the term SAME be taken in the vulgar acceptation, it is  certain (and not at all repugnant to the principles I maintain) that  different persons may perceive the same thing; or the same thing or idea  exist in different minds. Words are of arbitrary imposition; and, since  men are used to apply the word SAME where no distinction or variety is  perceived, and I do not pretend to alter their perceptions, it follows  that, as men have said before, SEVERAL SAW THE SAME THING, so they may,  upon like occasions, still continue to use the same phrase, without any  deviation either from propriety of language, or the truth of things. But,  if the term SAME be used in the acceptation of philosophers, who  pretend to an abstracted notion of identity, then, according to their  sundry definitions of this notion (for it is not yet agreed wherein that  philosophic identity consists), it may or may not be possible for divers  persons to perceive the same thing. But whether philosophers shall think  fit to CALL a thing the SAME or no, is, I conceive, of small  importance. Let us suppose several men together, all endued with the same  faculties, and consequently affected in like sort by their senses, and  who had yet never known the use of language; they would, without  question, agree in their perceptions. Though perhaps, when they came to  the use of speech, some regarding the uniformness of what was perceived,  might call it the SAME thing: others, especially regarding the  diversity of persons who perceived, might choose the denomination of  DIFFERENT things. But who sees not that all the dispute is about a  word? to wit, whether what is perceived by different persons may yet  have the term SAME applied to it? Or, suppose a house, whose walls or  outward shell remaining unaltered, the chambers are all pulled down, and  new ones built in their place; and that you should call this the SAME,  and I should say it was not the SAME house.--would we not, for all  this, perfectly agree in our thoughts of the house, considered in itself?  And would not all the difference consist in a sound? If you should say,  We differed in our notions; for that you super-added to your idea of the  house the simple abstracted idea of identity, whereas I did not; I would  tell you, I know not what you mean by THE ABSTRACTED IDEA OF IDENTITY;  and should desire you to look into your own thoughts, and be sure you  understood yourself.--Why so silent, Hylas? Are you not yet satisfied men  may dispute about identity and diversity, without any real difference in  their thoughts and opinions, abstracted from names? Take this farther  reflexion with you: that whether Matter be allowed to exist or no, the  case is exactly the same as to the point in hand. For the Materialists  themselves acknowledge what we immediately perceive by our senses to be  our own ideas. Your difficulty, therefore, that no two see the same  thing, makes equally against the Materialists and me.    HYL.  Ay, Philonous, but they suppose an external archetype, to  which referring their several ideas they may truly be said to perceive  the same thing.    PHIL.  And (not to mention your having discarded those archetypes) so  may you suppose an external archetype on my principles;--EXTERNAL, _I_  MEAN, TO YOUR OWN MIND: though indeed it must be' supposed to exist in  that Mind which comprehends all things; but then, this serves all the  ends of IDENTITY, as well as if it existed out of a mind. And I am sure  you yourself will not say it is less intelligible.    HYL.  You have indeed clearly satisfied me--either that there is no  difficulty at bottom in this point; or, if there be, that it makes  equally against both opinions.    PHIL.  But that which makes equally against two contradictory opinions  can be a proof against neither.    HYL.  I acknowledge it. But, after all, Philonous, when I consider  the substance of what you advance against SCEPTICISM, it amounts to no  more than this: We are sure that we really see, hear, feel; in a word,  that we are affected with sensible impressions.    PHIL.  And how are WE concerned any farther? I see this cherry, I feel  it, I taste it: and I am sure NOTHING cannot be seen, or felt, or  tasted: it is therefore real. Take away the sensations of softness,  moisture, redness, tartness, and you take away the cherry, since it is  not a being distinct from sensations. A cherry, I say, is nothing but a  congeries of sensible impressions, or ideas perceived by various senses:  which ideas are united into one thing (or have one name given them) by  the mind, because they are observed to attend each other. Thus, when the  palate is affected with such a particular taste, the sight is affected  with a red colour, the touch with roundness, softness, &c. Hence, when I  see, and feel, and taste, in such sundry certain manners, I am sure the  cherry exists, or is real; its reality being in my opinion nothing  abstracted from those sensations. But if by the word CHERRY, you mean  an unknown nature, distinct from all those sensible qualities, and by its  EXISTENCE something distinct from its being perceived; then, indeed, I  own, neither you nor I, nor any one else, can be sure it exists.    HYL.  But, what would you say, Philonous, if I should bring the very  same reasons against the existence of sensible things IN A MIND, which  you have offered against their existing IN A MATERIAL SUBSTRATUM?    PHIL.  When I see your reasons, you shall hear what I have to say to  them.    HYL.  Is the mind extended or unextended?    PHIL.  Unextended, without doubt.    HYL.  Do you say the things you perceive are in your mind?    PHIL.  They are.    HYL.  Again, have I not heard you speak of sensible impressions?    PHIL.  I believe you may.    HYL.  Explain to me now, O Philonous! how it is possible there should be  room for all those trees and houses to exist in your mind. Can extended  things be contained in that which is unextended? Or, are we to imagine  impressions made on a thing void of all solidity? You cannot say objects  are in your mind, as books in your study: or that things are imprinted on  it, as the figure of a seal upon wax. In what sense, therefore, are we to  understand those expressions? Explain me this if you can: and I shall  then be able to answer all those queries you formerly put to me about my  SUBSTRATUM.    PHIL.  Look you, Hylas, when I speak of objects as existing in the mind,  or imprinted on the senses, I would not be understood in the gross  literal sense; as when bodies are said to exist in a place, or a seal to  make an impression upon wax. My meaning is only that the mind comprehends  or perceives them; and that it is affected from without, or by some being  distinct from itself. This is my explication of your difficulty; and how  it can serve to make your tenet of an unperceiving material SUBSTRATUM  intelligible, I would fain know.    HYL.  Nay, if that be all, I confess I do not see what use can be made  of it. But are you not guilty of some abuse of language in this?    PHIL.  None at all. It is no more than common custom, which you know is  the rule of language, hath authorised: nothing being more usual, than for  philosophers to speak of the immediate objects of the understanding as  things existing in the mind. 'Nor is there anything in this but what is  conformable to the general analogy of language; most part of the mental  operations being signified by words borrowed from sensible things; as is  plain in the terms COMPREHEND, reflect, DISCOURSE, &C., which,  being applied to the mind, must not be taken in their gross, original  sense.    HYL.  You have, I own, satisfied me in this point. But there still  remains one great difficulty, which I know not how you will get over.  And, indeed, it is of such importance that if you could solve all others,  without being able to find a solution for this, you must never expect to  make me a proselyte to your principles.    PHIL.  Let me know this mighty difficulty.    HYL.  The Scripture account of the creation is what appears to me  utterly irreconcilable with your notions. Moses tells us of a creation: a  creation of what? of ideas? No, certainly, but of things, of real things,  solid corporeal substances. Bring your principles to agree with this, and  I shall perhaps agree with you.    PHIL.  Moses mentions the sun, moon, and stars, earth and sea, plants  and animals. That all these do really exist, and were in the beginning  created by God, I make no question. If by IDEAS you mean fictions  and fancies of the mind, then these are no ideas. If by IDEAS you mean  immediate objects of the understanding, or sensible things, which cannot  exist unperceived, or out of a "]]]
