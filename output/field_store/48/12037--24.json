Unlike the Adelie, which, as we have seen, chooses the warmest and  lightest months of the year for the rearing of its young, the Emperor  performs this duty in the darkest, coldest, and most tempestuous time.  The only reason that has been suggested for this custom is that many  months must pass before the chicks are fully fledged. Were they hatched  in December (midsummer) as are Adelies, autumn would find them still  unfledged, and probably they would perish in consequence, whereas, being  hatched in the early spring, they are fostered by their parents until  the warmer weather begins, and then have the entire summer in which to  accomplish their change of plumage.      [Illustration: Fig. 73. AN EMPEROR PENGUIN (Page 134)]    The only Emperor rookery known to man at the present day was discovered  by Lieuts. Royds and Skelton, of Captain Scott's first Antarctic  expedition, on the sea-ice beneath Cape Crozier. Here in the dark days  of July this extraordinary bird lays its one egg upon the ice.    In the winter of 1911 a very brave journey was made to this spot by a  party of Captain Scott's officers, consisting of Dr. Wilson, Lieut.  Bowers and Mr. Cherry-Garrard. The experiences of this little band were  so terrible that it is remarkable they ever returned to tell of them.  Temperatures of -78 deg. F. were encountered, and the most severe blizzards  at lower temperatures than any sledging-party had yet endured. Under  these truly terrible conditions the Emperors lay their eggs and hatch  their young.    The mortality under such circumstances is very high, as one would  expect. Avalanches of ice fall from the cliffs above, crushing many of  the parent birds, and causing hundreds of eggs to be deserted. As Dr.  Wilson stated, the ice cliffs beneath which these remarkable animals sat  were so unstable that no man in his senses would camp for a single night  beneath them. In spite of this, evidence showed that after an avalanche  of ice blocks from above, which had caused some of the Emperors to leave  their eggs on the ice and bolt in terror, many of them had returned and  continued to sit on the eggs which had been frozen and killed by the  frost in their absence, continuing to do so long after they were  completely rotten. Indeed, in their desire for something to hatch, some  who had been deprived of their eggs, were seen to be attempting to  incubate pieces of ice in their place, and, unlike Adelies, they seem  ever ready to snatch and foster the young of their neighbours.    The first time the rookery at Cape Crozier was visited, not above one  thousand birds occupied it. On the second occasion their numbers were  far short of this. By the springtime only one out of ten or twelve birds  are seen to be rearing young, so it is obvious other rookeries await  discovery in other parts, as there are a large number of Emperors to be  seen along the Antarctic coasts.      [Illustration: Fig. 74. PROFILE OF AN EMPEROR (Page 134)]    When in the _Terra Nova_ we made our way along the face of the great  Barrier to the eastward, we saw large numbers of Emperors, especially to  the extreme eastward where a heavy hang of pack-ice blocked our further  passage, and I have little doubt that future exploration will disclose a  rookery or rookeries in this direction.    Again, in the spring of 1912, when nearing the end of a sledge journey  from the northward to Cape Evans we passed large gatherings of Emperor  penguins on some very old sea-ice under the Barrier's edge, along the  southern end of McMurdo Sound, and it seems not at all unlikely that  they may breed here too. Unfortunately we were unable at that time to  make detours, so had to leave the question unsettled, but if they do  breed here, they must have far to go to get food during those winters  when the sea-ice does not break out of the Sound.    The growth of the Emperor chick is slow, when compared with the  mushroom-like rate at which the Adelie youngster increases its  substance.    Approximately the egg is laid at the beginning of July and hatched out  some seven or eight weeks later. During the period of incubation, which  duty is shared by all, male and female alike, the egg is held in a loose  fold of skin at the lower part of the abdomen, the skin of the adults  being worn bare of feathers in this region.    When hatched out, the chick is coveted by every unoccupied adult, and so  desperate at times are the struggles for its possession that very  frequently it gets injured or killed by its would-be foster parents. Dr.  Wilson has estimated the mortality among the chicks before they shed  their down at 77 per cent. and thinks that half this number are killed  by kindness. Very often, in fact, they will crawl under projecting  ledges of ice, or anywhere to escape the attentions of half a dozen or  so of adults, all bearing down upon them together, only to meet and  struggle for their possession, during which process the innocent cause  may get trampled and clawed to death. So strong is the maternal instinct  of the Emperor, that frozen and lifeless chicks are carried about and  nursed until their down is worn away. In fact, the scientists who  visited the rookery were unable to get good specimens of dead chicks, as  all of these had been treated in this way.    Fortunately the Emperor chick escapes the depredation of the Skua gull,  which plays such havoc in the Adelie rookeries, because the Skua does  not come south until the summer, by which time the Emperor chicks are  well grown. As in the case of the Adelies, the black throat is not  acquired until the second moult. When this has taken place, the bird  looks remarkably handsome. The bill, which is curved and tapering, is  bluish black, but the posterior half of the mandible is coloured a  beautiful lilac. The head and throat are black, whilst on each side of  the neck is a patch of vivid orange feathers. The rest of the body is  marked in the same way as the Adelie.    The mortality among the chicks being so very high, the probability is  that the life of the adult is long, as otherwise the species could  hardly survive. Dr. Herbert Klugh has calculated that the Emperor  penguin lives for thirty-five years.    Evidence goes to show that the young birds spend their immaturity on the  pack-ice, as all those sighted and collected on the pack at any distance  to the northward have been immature, and no immature birds have been  seen along the coasts at any time during the summer.    The food of the Emperor mainly consists of fish and crustaceans. There  are invariably many small pebbles in the stomach. Like Adelies they must  of course have open water within reach in order to get food, and in the  neighbourhood of Cape Crozier this is always to be found, as the rapid  tide there keeps the sea from freezing in over a considerable area, so  that probably they never have to walk more than a mile or two to get  food.    The cry of the Emperor is very loud and travels far across the ice. When  sledging over the sea-ice in the spring, in the neighbourhood of Cape  Adare, a curious sound was heard at times, reminding one strongly of the  \"overtone\" notes of a ship's steam horn. The sounds puzzled us at the  time, but I think now that most probably they were made by Emperor  penguins.    The egg of the Emperor is white, pyriform in shape, and weighs just  under 1 lb.    My own experience of these birds being limited I do not intend to enter  deeply into the subject. The only surviving member of the band who  visited Cape Crozier during the winter is Mr. Cherry-Garrard, and it is  much to be hoped that some day he will write us an account of what he  saw there. In the meantime for further details of the habits and  morphology of the species, the reader is referred to Dr. Wilson's work,  published in the second volume of the British Museum Reports, on the  National Antarctic Expedition 1901-1904.

Dona Juana:--Seeing that it has come to our notice, and that we have  seen by experience, that, owing to the pilots not being so expert as is  necessary, nor so well instructed in what they ought to know, so as to  be competent to rule and govern the ships that navigate in the voyage  over the Ocean Sea to our islands and mainland which we possess in the  Indies; and that through their default, either in not knowing how to  rule and govern, or through not knowing how to find the altitude by the  quadrant or astrolabe, nor the methods of calculating it, have happened  many disasters, and those who have sailed under their governance have  been exposed to great danger, by which our Lord has been ill-served, as  well as our finances, while the merchants who trade thither have received  much hurt and loss. And for a remedy to the above, and because it is  necessary, as well for that navigation as for other voyages by which,  with the help of our Lord, we hope to make new discoveries in other lands,  that there should be persons who are more expert and better instructed,  and who know the things necessary for such navigation, so that those  who are under them may go more safely, it is our will and pleasure, and  we order that all the pilots of our kingdoms and lordships, who are now  or shall hereafter be appointed as pilots in the said navigation to the  islands and mainland that we possess in the parts of the Indies, and in  other parts of the Ocean Sea, shall be instructed and shall know what  it is necessary for them to know respecting the quadrant and astrolabe,  in order that, by uniting theory with practice, they may be able to  make good use of them in the said voyages made to the said parts, and,  without such knowledge, no one shall go in the said ships as pilots,  nor receive pay as pilots, nor may the masters receive them on board ship,  until they have first been examined by you, Amerigo Despuchi, our Chief  Pilot, and they shall be given by you a certificate of examination  and approval touching the knowledge of each one. Holding the said  certificates, we order that they shall be taken and received as expert  pilots by whoever is shown them, for it is our pleasure that you shall  be examiner of the said pilots.      In order that those who have not the knowledge may more easily learn,  we order that you are to teach them, in your house in Seville, all  those things that they ought to know, you receiving payment for your  trouble. And as it may happen that now, in the beginning, there may be a  scarcity of passed pilots, and some ships may be detained for the want  of them, causing loss and harm to the citizens of the said islands, as  well as to merchants and other persons who trade thither, we order you,  the said Amerigo, and we give you licence that you may select the most  efficient pilots from among those who have been there, that for one or  two voyages, or for a certain period, they may supply what is necessary,  while those others acquire the knowledge that they have to learn, so  that there may be time for them to learn what is needed.    It is also reported to us that there are many charts, by different  masters, on which are delineated the lands and islands of the Indies, to  us belonging, which by our order have recently been discovered, and that  these charts differ very much one from another, as well in the routes  as in the delineations of coasts, which may cause much inconvenience. In  order that there may be uniformity, it is our pleasure, and we order that  there shall be made a general chart (_Padron General_), and that it may  be more accurate, we order our officers of the House of _Contratacion_  at Seville that they shall assemble all the ablest pilots that are to  be found in the country at the time, and that, in the presence of you,  Amerigo Despuchi, our Chief Pilot, a _padron_ of all the lands and  islands of the Indies that have hitherto been discovered belonging to our  kingdoms and lordships shall be made; and that for it, after consulting  and reasoning with those pilots, and in accord with you, the said Chief  Pilot, a general _padron_ shall be constructed, which shall be called  the _Padron Real_, by which all pilots shall be ruled and governed, and  that it shall be in the possession of the aforesaid our officers, and  of you, our Chief Pilot; and that no pilot shall use any other chart,  but only one which has been taken from the _Padron Real_, on pain of a  fine of fifty _dobles_ towards the works of the House of _Contratacion_  of the Indies in the city of Seville.    We further order all the pilots of our kingdoms and lordships who,  from this time forward, shall go to the said our lands of the Indies,  discovered or to be discovered, that, when they find new lands, islands,  bays, or harbours, or anything else, that they make a note of them for  the said _Padron Real_, and on arriving in Castille that they shall give  an account to you, the said our Chief Pilot, and to the officers of the  House of _Contratacion_ of Seville, that all may be delineated properly  on the said _Padron Real_, with the object that navigators may be better  taught and made expert in navigation. We further order that none of  our pilots who navigate the Ocean Sea, from this time forward, shall  go without their quadrant and astrolabe and the rules for working them,  under the penalty that those who do not comply be rendered incompetent  to exercise the said employment during our pleasure, and they shall not  resume such employment without our special licence, paying a fine of  10,000 maravedis towards the works of the said House of _Contratacion_  at Seville. Amerigo Despuchi shall use and exercise the said office of  our Chief Pilot, and you are empowered to do so, and you shall do all  the things contained in this letter, and which appertain to the said  office; and by this our letter, and by its copy attested by the public  notary, we order the Prince Charles, our very dear and well-beloved  son, the Infantes, Dukes, Prelates, Counts, Marquises, Ricos-Hombres,  Masters of Orders, Members of Council, and Judges of our Courts  and Chancelleries, and the other priors, commanders, sub-commanders,  castellans of our castles and forts, the magistrates, officers of justice,  knights, esquires, officers, and good men of all the cities, towns,  and villages of our kingdoms and lordships, and all captains of ships,  master mariners, pilots, mates, and all other persons whom our letter  concerns or may concern, that you have and hold as our Chief Pilot,  and consent and allow him to"]]]
