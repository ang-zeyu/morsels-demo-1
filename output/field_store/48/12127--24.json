[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#18)"],[1," demonstrates to us, that during the life of an animal every part of  its living substance is undergoing a perpetual change; all its  component parts, assuming the form of lifeless compounds, are thrown  off by the skin, lungs, and urinary system, altered more or less by  the secretory organs. This change in the living body is intimately  connected with the process of respiration; it is, in truth,  occasioned by the oxygen of the atmosphere in breathing, which  combines with all the various matters within the body. At every  inspiration a quantity of oxygen passes into the blood in the lungs,  and unites with its elements; but although the weight of the oxygen  thus daily entering into the body amounts to 32 or more ounces, yet  the weight of the body is not thereby increased. Exactly as much  oxygen as is imbibed in inspiration passes off in expiration, in the  form of carbonic acid and water; so that with every breath the  amount of carbon and hydrogen in the body is diminished. But the  emaciation--the loss of weight by starvation--does not simply depend  upon the separation of the carbon and hydrogen; but all the other  substances which are in combination with these elements in the  living tissues pass off in the secretions. The nitrogen undergoes a  change, and is thrown out of the system by the kidneys. Their  secretion, the urine, contains not only a compound rich in nitrogen,  namely urea, but the sulphur of the tissues in the form of a  sulphate, all the soluble salts of the blood and animal fluids,  common salt, the phosphates, soda and potash. The carbon and  hydrogen of the blood, of the muscular fibre, and of all the animal  tissues which can undergo change, return into the atmosphere. The  nitrogen, and all the soluble inorganic elements are carried to the  earth in the urine.    These changes take place in the healthy animal body during every  moment of life; a waste and loss of substance proceeds continually;  and if this loss is to be restored, and the original weight and  substance repaired, an adequate supply of materials must be  furnished, from whence the blood and wasted tissues may be  regenerated. This supply is obtained from the food.    In an adult person in a normal or healthy condition, no sensible  increase or decrease of weight occurs from day to day. In youth the  weight of the body increases, whilst in old age it decreases. There  can be no doubt that in the adult, the food has exactly replaced the  loss of substance: it has supplied just so much carbon, hydrogen,  nitrogen, and other elements, as have passed through the skin,  lungs, and urinary organs. In youth the supply is greater than the  waste. Part of the elements of the food remain to augment the bulk  of the body. In old age the waste is greater than the supply, and  the body diminishes. It is unquestionable, that, with the exception  of a certain quantity of carbon and hydrogen, which are secreted  through the skin and lungs, we obtain, in the solid and fluid  excrements of man and animals, all the elements of their food.    We obtain daily, in the form of urea, all the nitrogen taken in the  food both of the young and the adult; and further, in the urine, the  whole amount of the alkalies, soluble phosphates and sulphates,  contained in all the various aliments. In the solid excrements are  found all those substances taken in the food which have undergone no  alteration in the digestive organs, all indigestible matters, such  as woody fibre, the green colouring matter of leaves ( chlorophyle),  wax, &c.    Physiology teaches us, that the process of nutrition in animals,  that is, their increase of bulk, or the restoration of wasted parts,  proceeds from the blood. The purpose of digestion and assimilation  is to convert the food into blood. In the stomach and intestines,  therefore, all those substances in the food capable of conversion  into blood are separated from its other constituents; in other  words, during the passage of the food through the intestinal canal  there is a constant absorption of its nitrogen, since only azotised  substances are capable of conversion into blood; and therefore the  solid excrements are destitute of that element, except only a small  portion, in the constitution of that secretion which is formed to  facilitate their passage. With the solid excrements, the phosphates  of lime and magnesia, which were contained in the food and not  assimilated, are carried off, these salts being insoluble in water,  and therefore not entering the urine.    We may obtain a clear insight into the chemical constitution of the  solid excrements without further investigation, by comparing the  faeces of a dog with his food. We give that animal flesh and  bones--substances rich in azotised matter--and we obtain, as the  last product of its digestion, a perfectly white excrement, solid  while moist, but becoming in dry air a powder. This is the phosphate  of lime of the bones, with scarcely one per cent. of foreign organic  matter.    Thus we see that in the solid and fluid excrements of man and  animals, all the nitrogen--in short, all the constituent ingredients  of the consumed food, soluble and insoluble, are returned; and as  food is primarily derived from the fields, we possess in those  excrements all the ingredients which we have taken from it in the  form of seeds, roots, or herbs.    One part of the crops employed for fattening sheep and cattle is  consumed by man as animal food; another part is taken directly--as  flour, potatoes, green vegetables, &c.; a third portion consists of  vegetable refuse, and straw employed as litter. None of the  materials of the soil need be lost. We can, it is obvious, get back  all its constituent parts which have been withdrawn therefrom, as  fruits, grain and animals, in the fluid and solid excrements of man,  and the bones, blood and skins of the slaughtered animals. It  depends upon ourselves to collect carefully all these scattered  elements, and to restore the disturbed equilibrium of composition in  the soil. We can calculate exactly how much and which of the  component parts of the soil we export in a sheep or an ox, in a  quarter of barley, wheat or potatoes, and we can discover, from the  known composition of the excrements of man and animals, how much we  have to supply to restore what is lost to our fields.    If, however, we could procure from other sources the substances  which give to the exuviae of man and animals their value in  agriculture, we should not need the latter. It is quite indifferent  for our purpose whether we supply the ammonia (the source of  nitrogen) in the form of urine, or in that of a salt derived from  coal-tar; whether we derive the phosphate of lime from bones,  apatite, or fossil excrements (the coprolithes).    The principal problem for agriculture is, how to replace those  substances which have been taken from the soil, and which cannot be  furnished by the atmosphere. If the manure supplies an imperfect  compensation for this loss, the fertility of a field or of a country  decreases; if, on the contrary, more are given to the fields, their  fertility increases.    An importation of urine, or of solid excrements, from a foreign  country, is equivalent to an importation of grain and cattle. In a  certain time, the elements of those substances assume the form of  grain, or of fodder, then become flesh and bones, enter into the  human body, and return again day by day to the form they originally  possessed.    The only real loss of elements we are unable to prevent is of the  phosphates, and these, in accordance with the customs of all modern  nations, are deposited in the grave. For the rest, every part of  that enormous quantity of food which a man consumes during his  lifetime ( say in sixty or seventy years), which was derived from  the fields, can be obtained and returned to them. We know with  absolute certainty, that in the blood of a young or growing animal  there remains a certain quantity of phosphate of lime and of the  alkaline phosphates, to be stored up and to minister to the growth  of the bones and general bulk of the body, and that, with the  exception of this very small quantity, we receive back, in the solid  and fluid excrements, all the salts and alkaline bases, all the  phosphate of lime and magnesia, and consequently all the inorganic  elements which the animal consumes in its food.    We can thus ascertain precisely the quantity, quality, and  composition of animal excrements, without the trouble of analysing  them. If we give a horse daily 4 1/2 pounds' weight of oats, and 15  pounds of hay, and knowing that oats give 4 per cent. and hay 9 per  cent. of ashes, we can calculate that the daily excrements of the  horse will contain 21 ounces of inorganic matter which was drawn  from the fields. By analysis we can determine the exact relative  amount of silica, of phosphates, and of alkalies, contained in the  ashes of the oats and of the hay.    You will now understand that the constituents of the solid parts of  animal excrements, and therefore their qualities as manure, must  vary with the nature of the creature's food. If we feed a cow upon  beetroot, or potatoes, without hay, straw or grain, there will be no  silica in her solid excrements, but there will be phosphate of lime  and magnesia. Her fluid excrements will contain carbonate of potash  and soda, together with compounds of the same bases with inorganic  acids. In one word, we have, in the fluid excrements, all the  soluble parts of the ashes of the consumed food; and in the solid  excrements, all those parts of the ashes which are insoluble in  water.    If the food, after burning, leaves behind ashes containing soluble  alkaline phosphates, as is the case with bread, seeds of all kinds,  and flesh, we obtain from the animal by which they are consumed a  urine holding in solution these phosphates. If, however, the ashes  of food contain no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#18)"],[1,"ormonism,\" the  Representatives' Hall was tendered the brethren for holding religious  service, on Sunday, and Elder Taylor and Orson Hyde were appointed by  the Prophet to preach, the latter in the forenoon, the former in the  afternoon.    In all these vexatious prosecutions Elder Taylor stood very near the  Prophet, and ably defended him through the editorial columns of the  _Times and Seasons_ and the _Neighbor_.    In the meantime the phenomenal growth of the Church, the prosperity of  the Saints in Nauvoo, and the rapid progress of the city, while very  gratifying to the founders of both Church and city, attracted to the  body religious and municipal a class of men that were very undesirable.  Adventurers seeking for place and power and wealth; demagogues who by  fulsome flattery of the people hoped to attain through their political  influence a realization of their ambitious dreams; knaves who by  falsely professing conversion, thought to cover up corrupt, licentious  lives, and thrive by villainy; thieves and counterfeiters who saw their  opportunity to live by roguery, and steal on the credit of the Mormons,  of whom the people of Illinois were too ready to believe anything that  savored of evil, because prejudiced against their religion--all these  characters were attracted to Nauvoo by the prosperity that reigned  there; and their ungodly conduct hastened the evil day of the city's  destruction.    Chief among these reckless adventurers was John C. Bennett, a man of  learning and intellectual ability but a moral leper. He was guilty of  the most infamous, licentious practices, and seduced several women by  representing that promiscuous intercourse of the sexes was a doctrine  believed in by the Latter-day Saints and that there was no harm in it.  He also said that Joseph Smith and other Church leaders both sanctioned  and practiced such wickedness; that Joseph only denounced such things  in public so vehemently because of the prejudice of the people, and the  trouble that might arise in his own house.    For this conduct he was excommunicated from the Church, compelled to  resign the Mayorship of the city, expelled from the Masonic Lodge,  chastised by the Legion, and his infamy published to the world and  denounced.    This filled him with bitterness against the Saints, and especially  against the Prophet. He at once set on foot measures that he hoped  would bring him a terrible revenge. He succeeded in getting the  Missourians to issue a new warrant for his arrest on the old charge of  \"theft, arson and murder,\" and a new requisition for his arrest was  granted by Governor Ford, of Illinois.    The warrants were served on the Prophet in Lee County, some two hundred  miles from Nauvoo. The officers who arrested him sought to drag him  immediately into Missouri, but in this they failed, as Joseph through  some friends obtained a writ of _habeas corpus_, and the legality of  the warrant was enquired into by the municipal court of Nauvoo. The  court also went behind the writ and tried the case _exparte_ on its  merits, and discharged the accused for want of subsistence in the  warrant on which he was arrested, as well as upon the merits of the  case.    Elder Taylor in an editorial in the _Neighbor_ of July 5th 1843, thus  deals with the course pursued by Missouri in these several instances of  persecution against the Prophet:    \"It has fallen to our lot of late years to keep an account of any  remarkable circumstances that might transpire in and about this and  adjoining states; as well as of distant provinces and nations. Among  the many robberies, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes,  fires, mobs, wars, etc., which we have had to record, there is one  circumstance of annual occurrence which it has always fallen to our  lot to chronicle. We allude not to the yearly inundation of the Nile,  nor the frequent eruptions of Vesuvius or AEtna, but to the boiling over  of Tophet, _alias_ the annual overflow of the excrescence of Missouri.  Not indeed, like the Nile, over-flowing its parched banks, invigorating  its alluvial soil and causing vegetation to teem forth in its richest  attire; but like the sulphurous flame that burns unnoticed in the  bowels of a volcano; kept alive by the combustion of its own native  element, until it can contain itself no longer within the limits of its  crater; it bursts beyond its natural bounds; spreads its sulphurous  lava all around, leaving naught but desolation in its path,--destroying  alike the cot of the husbandman, and the palace of the noble, in one  grand sweep; covering vegetation with its fiery lava, and turning the  garden into a bed of cinders. So Missouri has her annual ebulitions,  and must belch forth her sulphurous lava and seek to overwhelm others;  and as it happens that we are so unfortunate as to live near the  borders of this monster, we must ever and anon, be smutted with the  soot that flies off from her burning crater.    \"Without entering here into the particulars of the bloody deeds, the  high-handed oppression, the unconstitutional acts, the deadly and  malicious hate, the numerous murders and the wholesale robberies  of that people, we will proceed to notice one of the late acts of  Missouri, or of the governor of that state, towards us. We allude to  the late arrest of Joseph Smith.\"    Then follows an account of the arrests of the Prophet and the manner in  which he was released from the officers as already briefly stated in  this chapter; he dwells at some length on the events of the last arrest  made near Dixon, detailing the cruelty and brutality of the officers.  He then concludes:    \"Why Governor Ford should lend his assistance in a vexatious  prosecution of this kind we are at a loss to determine. He possesses a  discretionary power in such cases, and has a right to use his judgment,  as the chief magistrate of this state; and knowing, as he does, that  the whole proceedings connected with this affair are illegal, we think  that in justice he ought to have leaned to the side of the oppressed  and innocent, particularly when the persecuted and prosecuted were  citizens of his own state who had a right to his sympathies and to be  shielded by his paternal care, as the father of this state. Does not  his excellency know, and do not all the citizens of the state know,  that the Mormons have been robbed, pillaged and plundered in Missouri  without any redress? That the Mormons _en masse_ were exterminated from  that state without any legal pretext whatever? How, then, could they  have any legal claim upon Joseph Smith or any Mormon? Have the Mormons  ever obtained any redress for injuries received in Missouri? No. Is  there any prospect of their receiving any remuneration for their loss,  or redress for their grievances? No. When a demand was make upon the  governor of Missouri, by Governor Carlin of this state for the persons  who kidnapped several Mormons, were they given up by that state? No.  Why then should our executive feel so tenacious in fulfilling all the  nice punctillios of law, when the very state that is making these  demands has robbed, murdered and exterminated by wholesale, without  law, and is merely making use of it at present as a cat's paw to  destroy the innocent and murder those that they have already persecuted  nearly to the death.    \"It is impossible that the State of Missouri should do justice with her  coffers groaning with the spoils of the oppressed, and her hands yet  reeking with the blood of the innocent. Shall she yet gorge her bloody  maw with other victims? Shall Joseph Smith be given into her hands  illegally? Never! _No, never!!_ No, NEVER!!!\"    He afterwards published in the _Neighbor_ full details of this  _exparte_ trial with the affidavits of the several witnesses given  _in extenso_. Those affidavits make up an indictment against the  State of Missouri which brings the hot blush of shame to the cheek  of every lover of his country's institutions. In their treatment of  the Latter-day Saints the leading officials of Missouri were guilty  not only of high-handed oppression, but of such high crimes and  misdemeanors as would have hung them had they met the just penalty of  their misdeeds. But as those who suffered were members of an unpopular  Church, the atrocious and bloody deeds of that state were passed by and  no one felt called upon to demand justice in behalf of the oppressed;  and those powers that were appealed to for redress of grievances--the  President and congress of the United States--claimed to have no power  to interfere. Mobocracy had triumphed in Missouri, and there was no  power in the government to call Missouri to an account for her wrong  doing.    At the time of the Prophet's arrest at Dixon there was an exciting  political campaign in progress in that part of Illinois where Nauvoo  was located, for representative to congress, and also for county  officers. Two parties were in the field, Whigs and Democrats; each  anxious to obtain the Mormon vote. The Democrats accused the Whigs of  being the instigators of this last arrest of Joseph Smith, at that  particular juncture, that Governor Ford, a Democrat, might be compelled  to issue a warrant for his arrest and thus influence the Saints against  the Democrats; and in proof of this referred to the fact that John  C. Bennett, at whose instance, doubtless, this last warrant for the  arrest of the Prophet was gotten up in Missouri, was the special pet  of what was called the \"Whig junto\" in Springfield; that a special  session of the circuit court was called in Daviess County, Missouri,  in order to have the warrant act at the proper juncture; that Cyrus  Walker, the Whig candidate for Congress, was within six miles of Dixon  when the Prophet was arrested; that he refused to act as council for  him only on the condition that he pledged him his vote (that pledge  Walker was pleased to consider as binding to his interest"]]]
