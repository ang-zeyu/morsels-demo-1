But one thing, senor, troubles me  more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your  worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go  and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this  poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I  think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies,  and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle  of the street they won't know her any more than they would my father.\"    \"Perhaps, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"the enchantment does not go so  far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power  of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the  first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by  commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them  in this respect.\"    \"I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\" said  Sancho; \"and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;  and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the  misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea  is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as  well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own  course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\"    Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a  cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages  and figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as  carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt  or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote's  eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel  with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to  all appearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god  called Cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows;  there was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or  helmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along  with these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces. All  this, unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and  struck terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote  was glad of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting  itself to him, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to  face any danger, he planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud  and menacing tone, exclaimed, \"Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever  thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who  these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon's  boat than an ordinary cart.\"    To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, \"Senor, we are  players of Angulo el Malo's company; we have been acting the play of 'The  Cortes of Death' this morning, which is the octave of Corpus Christi, in  a village behind that hill, and we have to act it this afternoon in that  village which you can see from this; and as it is so near, and to save  the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go in the costumes in  which we perform. That lad there appears as Death, that other as an  angel, that woman, the manager's wife, plays the queen, this one the  soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I am one of the principal  characters of the play, for in this company I take the leading parts. If  you want to know anything more about us, ask me and I will answer with  the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up to everything.\"    \"By the faith of a knight-errant,\" replied Don Quixote, \"when I saw this  cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me; but I  declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if  illusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep your  festival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can render  you a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child I was  fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor's art.\"    While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a  mummers' dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown  ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew  approaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the  ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the  bells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite of  Don Quixote's efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he  set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy  ever gave any promise of.    Sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off  Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him  he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante, who had come  down with his master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante's vivacity  and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted his beast to go and help  Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on Dapple, and  beating him with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain  of the blows, made him fly across the fields towards the village where  they were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessed Dapple's career  and his master's fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need he  should attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good  servant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for  his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come  down on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of  death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his  own eyes than on the least hair of his ass's tail. In this trouble and  perplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than  he liked, and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him,  \"Senor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.\"    \"What devil?\" asked Don Quixote.    \"The one with the bladders,\" said Sancho.    \"Then I will recover him,\" said Don Quixote, \"even if he be shut up with  him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me, Sancho, for  the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make good the loss  of Dapple.\"    \"You need not take the trouble, senor,\" said Sancho; \"keep cool, for as I  now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his old  quarters;\" and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, in  imitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the  town, and the ass came back to his master.    \"For all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"it will be well to visit the  discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it were  the emperor himself.\"    \"Don't think of it, your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"take my advice and  never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have  known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;  remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours  and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they  are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or most of whom in  dress and appearance look like princes.\"    \"Still, for all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"the player devil must not go  off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.\"    So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,  shouting out as he went, \"Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to  teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of  knights-errant for steeds.\"    So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and  understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker's intention  was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the  devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god Cupid  stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line,  prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles. Don  Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted  arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began  to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to  himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack  this well-ordered squadron, said to him, \"It would be the height of  madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops  from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the  world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one  should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to  attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person,  with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not  make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all  these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a  single knight-errant.\"    \"Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"which  may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. I cannot  and must not draw sword, as I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#18)"],[1,"his life, and no man was to repeat them  or sing the verses, but if any sung them, the man who uttered  them was to fall without atonement.    Both Gunnar and Njal gave each other their words that no such  matters should ever happen that they would not settle among  themselves; and this pledge was well kept ever after, and they  were always friends.

OF GIZUR THE WHITE AND GEIR THE PRIEST    There was a man named Gizur the White; he was Teit's son;  Kettlebjorn the Old's son, of Mossfell. (1)  Bishop Isleif was  Gizur's son.  Gizur the White kept house at Mossfell, and was a  great chief.  That man is also named in this story whose name was  Geir the Priest; his mother was Thorkatla, another daughter of  Kettlebjorn the Old of Mossfell.  Geir kept house at Lithe.  He  and Gizur backed one another in every matter.  At that time Mord  Valgard's son kept house at Hof on the Rangrivervales; he was  crafty and spiteful.  Valgard his father was then abroad, but his  mother was dead.  He was very envious of Gunnar of Lithend.  He  was wealthy, so far as goods went, but had not many friends.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  Teit's mother's name was Helga.  She was a daughter of Thord       Longbeard, who was the son of Hrapp, who was the son of       Bjorn the Rough-footed, who was the son of Grim, the Lord of       Sogn in Norway.  Gizur's mother's name was Olof.  She was a       daughter of Lord Baudvar, Viking-Kari's son.        47. OF OTKELL IN KIRKBY    There was a man named Otkell; he was the son of Skarf, the son of  Hallkell, who fought with Grim of Grimsness, and felled him on  the holm. (1)  This Hallkell and Kettlebjorn the Old were  brothers.    Otkell kept house at Kirkby; his wife's name was Thorgerda; she  was a daughter of Mar, the son of Runolf, the son of Naddad of  the Faroe Isles.  Otkell was wealthy in goods.  His son's name  was Thorgeir; he was young in years, and a bold dashing man.    Skamkell was the name of another man; he kept house at another  farm called Hof (2); he was well off for money, but he was a  spiteful man and a liar; quarrelsome too, and ill to deal with.  He was Otkell's friend.  Hallkell was the name of Otkell's  brother; he was a tall strong man, and lived there with Otkell;  their brother's name was Hallbjorn the White; he brought out to  Iceland a thrall, whose name was Malcolm; he was Irish, and had  not many friends.    Hallbjorn went to stay with Otkell, and so did his thrall  Malcolm.  The thrall was always saying that he should think  himself happy if Otkell owned him.  Otkell was kind to him, and  gave him a knife and belt, and a full suit of clothes, but the  thrall turned his hand to any work that Otkell wished.    Otkell wanted to make a bargain with his brother for the thrall;  he said he would give him the thrall, but said, too, that he was  a worse treasure than he thought.  But as soon as Otkell owned  the thrall, then he did less and less work.  Otkell often said  outright to Hallbjorn, that he thought the thrall did little  work; and he told Otkell that there was worse in him yet to  come.    At that time came a great scarcity, so that men fell short both  of meat and hay, and that spread over all parts of Iceland.  Gunnar shared his hay and meat with many men; and all got them  who came thither, so long as his stores lasted.  At last it came  about that Gunnar himself fell short both of hay and meat.  Then  Gunnar called on Kolskegg to go along with him; he called too on  Thrain Sigfus' son, and Lambi Sigurd's son.  They fared to  Kirkby, and called Otkell out.  He greeted them, and Gunnar said,  \"It so happens that I am come to deal with thee for hay and meat,  if there be any left.\"    Otkell answers, \"There is store of both, but I will sell thee  neither.\"    \"Wilt thou give me them then,\" says Gunnar, \"and run the risk of  my paying thee back somehow?\"    \"I will not do that either,\" says Otkell.    Skamkell all the while was giving him bad counsel.    Then Thrain Sigfus' son, said, \"It would serve him right if we  take both hay and meat and lay down the worth of them instead.\"    Skamkell answered, \"All the men of Mossfell must be dead and gone  then, if ye, sons of Sigfus, are to come and rob them.\"    \"I will have no hand in any robbery,\" says Gunnar.    \"Wilt thou buy a thrall of me?\" says Otkell.    \"I'll not spare to do that,\" says Gunnar.  After that Gunnar  bought the thrall, and fared away as things stood.    Njal hears of this, and said, \"Such things are ill done, to  refuse to let Gunnar buy; and it is not a good outlook for others  if such men as he cannot get what they want.\"    \"What's the good of thy talking so much about such a little  matter,\" says Bergthora; \"far more like a man would it be to let  him have both meat and hay, when thou lackest neither of them.\"    \"That is clear as day,\" says Njal, \"and I will of a surety supply  his need somewhat.\"    Then he fared up to Thorolfsfell, and his sons with him, and they  bound hay on fifteen horses; but on five horses they had meat.  Njal came to Lithend, and called Gunnar out.  He greeted them  kindly.    \"Here is hay and meat,\" said Njal, \"which I will give thee; and  my wish is, that thou shouldst never look to any one else than to  me if thou standest in need of anything.\"    \"Good are thy gifts,\" says Gunnar, \"but methinks thy friendship  is still more worth, and that of thy sons.\"    After that Njal fared home, and now the spring passes away.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  That is, slew him in a duel.  (2)  Mord Valgard's son lived at the other farm called Hof.        48. HOW HALLGERDA MAKES MALCOLM STEAL FROM KIRKBY    Now Gunnar is about to ride to the Thing, but a great crowd of  men from the Side (1) east turned in as guests at his house.    Gunnar bade them come and be his guests again, as they rode back  from the Thing; and they said they would do so.    Now they ride to the Thing, and Njal and his sons were there.  That Thing was still and quiet.    Now we must take up the story, and say that Hallgerda comes to  talk with Malcolm the thrall.    \"I have thought of an errand to send thee on,\" she says; \"thou  shalt go to Kirkby.\"    \"And what shall I do there?\" he says.    \"Thou shalt steal from thence food enough to load two horses, and  mind and have butter and cheese; but thou shalt lay fire in the  storehouse, and all will think that it has arisen out of  heedlessness, but no one will think that there has been theft.\"    \"Bad have I been,\" said the thrall, \"but never have I been a  thief.\"    \"Hear a wonder!\" says Hallgerda, \"thou makest thyself good, thou  that hast been both thief and murderer; but thou shalt not dare  to do aught else than go, else will I let thee be slain.\"    He thought he knew enough of her to be sure that she would so do  if he went not; so he took at night two horses and laid  packsaddles on them, and went his way to Kirkby.  The house-dog  knew him and did not bark at him, and ran and fawned on him.  After that he went to the storehouse and loaded the two horses  with food out of it, but the storehouse he burnt, and the dog he  slew.    He went up along by Rangriver, and his shoe-thong snapped; so he  takes his knife and makes the shoe right, but he leaves the knife  and belt lying there behind him.    He fares till he comes to Lithend; then he misses the knife, but  dares not to go back.    Now he brings Hallgerda the food, and she showed herself well  pleased at it.    Next morning when men came out of doors at Kirkby there they saw  great scathe.  Then a man was sent to the Thing to tell Otkell;  he bore the loss well, and said it must have happened because the  kitchen was next to the storehouse; and all thought that that was  how it happened.    Now men ride home from the Thing, and many rode to Lithend.  Hallgerda set food on the board, and in came cheese and butter.  Gunnar knew that such food was not to be looked for in his house,  and asked Hallgerda whence it came?    \"Thence,\" she says; \"whence thou mightest well eat of it;  besides, it is no man's business to trouble himself with  housekeeping.\"    Gunner got wroth and said, \"Ill indeed is it if I am a partaker  with thieves;\" and with that he gave her a slap on the cheek.    She said she would bear that slap in mind and repay it if she  could.    So she went off and he went with her, and then all that was  on the board was cleared away, but flesh-meat was brought in  instead, and all thought that was because the flesh was thought  to have been got in a better way.    Now the men who had been at the Thing fare away.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  That is, from the sea-side or shore, the long narrow strip       of habitable land between the mountains and the sea in the       south-east of Iceland.        49. OF SKAMKELL'S EVIL COUNSEL    Now we must tell of Skamkell.  He rides after some sheep up along  Rangriver, and he sees something shining in the path.  He finds a  knife and belt, and thinks he knows both of them.  He fares with  them to Kirkby; Otkell was out of doors when Skamkell came.  He  spoke to him and said, \"Knowest thou aught of these pretty  things?\"    \"Of a surety,\" says Otkell, \"I know them.\"    \"Who owns them?\" asks Skamkell.    \"Malcolm the thrall,\" says Otkell.    \"Then more shall see and know them than we two,\" says Skamkell,  \"for true will I be to thee in counsel.\"    They showed them to many men, and all knew them.  Then Skamkell  said, \"What counsel wilt thou now take?\"    \"We shall go and see Mord Valgard's son,\" answers Otkell, \"and  seek counsel of him.\"    So they went to Hof, and showed the pretty things to Mord, and  asked him if he knew them?    He said he knew them well enough, but what was there in that?  \"Do you think you have a right to look for anything at Lithend?\"    \"We think it hard for us,\""]]]
