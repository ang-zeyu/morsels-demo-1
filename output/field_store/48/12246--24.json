From their hovel on the St. Charles, they surveyed a field of  labor whose vastness might tire the wings of thought itself; a scene  repellent and appalling, darkened with omens of peril and woe. They were  an advance-guard of the great army of Loyola, strong in a discipline  that controlled not alone the body and the will, but the intellect, the  heart, the soul, and the inmost consciousness. The lives of these early  Canadian Jesuits attest the earnestness of their faith and the intensity  of their zeal; but it was a zeal bridled, curbed, and ruled by a guiding  hand. Their marvellous training in equal measure kindled enthusiasm and  controlled it, roused into action a mighty power, and made it as  subservient as those great material forces which modern science has  learned to awaken and to govern. They were drilled to a factitious  humility, prone to find utterance in expressions of self-depreciation  and self-scorn, which one may often judge unwisely, when he condemns  them as insincere. They were devoted believers, not only in the  fundamental dogmas of Rome, but in those lesser matters of faith which  heresy despises as idle and puerile superstitions. One great aim  engrossed their lives. \"For the greater glory of God\"--ad majorem Dei  gloriam--they would act or wait, dare, suffer, or die, yet all in  unquestioning subjection to the authority of the Superiors, in whom they  recognized the agents of Divine authority itself.          CHAPTER II.    LOYOLA AND THE JESUITS.    Conversion of Loyola â¢ Foundation of the Society of Jesus â¢ Preparation  of the Novice â¢ Characteristics of the Order â¢ The Canadian Jesuits    It was an evil day for new-born Protestantism, when a French  artilleryman fired the shot that struck down Ignatius Loyola in the  breach of Pampeluna. A proud noble, an aspiring soldier, a graceful  courtier, an ardent and daring gallant was metamorphosed by that stroke  into the zealot whose brain engendered and brought forth the mighty  Society of Jesus. His story is a familiar one: how, in the solitude of  his sick-room, a change came over him, upheaving, like an earthquake,  all the forces of his nature; how, in the cave of Manresa, the mysteries  of Heaven were revealed to him; how he passed from agonies to  transports, from transports to the calm of a determined purpose. The  soldier gave himself to a new warfare. In the forge of his great  intellect, heated, but not disturbed by the intense fires of his zeal,  was wrought the prodigious enginery whose power has been felt to the  uttermost confines of the world.    Loyola's training had been in courts and camps: of books he knew little  or nothing. He had lived in the unquestioning faith of one born and bred  in the very focus of Romanism; and thus, at the age of about thirty, his  conversion found him. It was a change of life and purpose, not of  belief. He presumed not to inquire into the doctrines of the Church. It  was for him to enforce those doctrines; and to this end he turned all  the faculties of his potent intellect, and all his deep knowledge of  mankind. He did not aim to build up barren communities of secluded  monks, aspiring to heaven through prayer, penance, and meditation, but  to subdue the world to the dominion of the dogmas which had subdued him;  to organize and discipline a mighty host, controlled by one purpose and  one mind, fired by a quenchless zeal or nerved by a fixed resolve, yet  impelled, restrained, and directed by a single master hand. The Jesuit  is no dreamer: he is emphatically a man of action; action is the end of  his existence.    It was an arduous problem which Loyola undertook to solve,--to rob a man  of volition, yet to preserve in him, nay, to stimulate, those energies  which would make him the most efficient instrument of a great design. To  this end the Jesuit novitiate and the constitutions of the Order are  directed. The enthusiasm of the novice is urged to its intensest pitch;  then, in the name of religion, he is summoned to the utter abnegation of  intellect and will in favor of the Superior, in whom he is commanded to  recognize the representative of God on earth. Thus the young zealot  makes no slavish sacrifice of intellect and will; at least, so he is  taught: for he sacrifices them, not to man, but to his Maker. No limit  is set to his submission: if the Superior pronounces black to be white,  he is bound in conscience to acquiesce. [1]    [1] Those who wish to know the nature of the Jesuit virtue of obedience  will find it set forth in the famous Letter on Obedience of Loyola.    Loyola's book of Spiritual Exercises is well known. In these exercises  lies the hard and narrow path which is the only entrance to the Society  of Jesus. The book is, to all appearance, a dry and superstitious  formulary; but, in the hands of a skilful director of consciences, it  has proved of terrible efficacy. The novice, in solitude and darkness,  day after day and night after night, ponders its images of perdition and  despair. He is taught to hear, in imagination, the howlings of the  damned, to see their convulsive agonies, to feel the flames that burn  without consuming, to smell the corruption of the tomb and the fumes of  the infernal pit. He must picture to himself an array of adverse armies,  one commanded by Satan on the plains of Babylon, one encamped under  Christ about the walls of Jerusalem; and the perturbed mind, humbled by  long contemplation of its own vileness, is ordered to enroll itself  under one or the other banner. Then, the choice made, it is led to a  region of serenity and celestial peace, and soothed with images of  divine benignity and grace. These meditations last, without  intermission, about a month, and, under an astute and experienced  directorship, they have been found of such power, that the Manual of  Spiritual Exercises boasts to have saved souls more in number than the  letters it contains.    To this succeed two years of discipline and preparation, directed, above  all things else, to perfecting the virtues of humility and obedience.  The novice is obliged to perform the lowest menial offices, and the most  repulsive duties of the sick-room and the hospital; and he is sent  forth, for weeks together, to beg his bread like a common mendicant. He  is required to reveal to his confessor, not only his sins, but all those  hidden tendencies, instincts, and impulses which form the distinctive  traits of character. He is set to watch his comrades, and his comrades  are set to watch him. Each must report what he observes of the acts and  dispositions of the others; and this mutual espionage does not end with  the novitiate, but extends to the close of life. The characteristics of  every member of the Order are minutely analyzed, and methodically put on  record.    This horrible violence to the noblest qualities of manhood, joined to  that equivocal system of morality which eminent casuists of the Order  have inculcated, must, it may be thought, produce deplorable effects  upon the characters of those under its influence. Whether this has been  actually the case, the reader of history may determine. It is certain,  however, that the Society of Jesus has numbered among its members men  whose fervent and exalted natures have been intensified, without being  abased, by the pressure to which they have been subjected.    It is not for nothing that the Society studies the character of its  members so intently, and by methods so startling. It not only uses its  knowledge to thrust into obscurity or cast out altogether those whom it  discovers to be dull, feeble, or unwilling instruments of its purposes,  but it assigns to every one the task to which his talents or his  disposition may best adapt him: to one, the care of a royal conscience,  whereby, unseen, his whispered word may guide the destiny of nations; to  another, the instruction of children; to another, a career of letters or  science; and to the fervent and the self-sacrificing, sometimes also to  the restless and uncompliant, the distant missions to the heathen.    The Jesuit was, and is, everywhere,--in the school-room, in the library,  in the cabinets of princes and ministers, in the huts of savages, in the  tropics, in the frozen North, in India, in China, in Japan, in Africa,  in America; now as a Christian priest, now as a soldier, a  mathematician, an astrologer, a Brahmin, a mandarin, under countless  disguises, by a thousand arts, luring, persuading, or compelling souls  into the fold of Rome.    Of this vast mechanism for guiding and governing the minds of men, this  mighty enginery for subduing the earth to the dominion of an idea, this  harmony of contradictions, this moral Proteus, the faintest sketch must  now suffice. A disquisition on the Society of Jesus would be without  end. No religious order has ever united in itself so much to be admired  and so much to be detested. Unmixed praise "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#18)"],[1,"and when those are connected with  variometers and variable condensers, and with a proper aerial, you  will have a highly efficient receptor that will work over all ranges  of wave lengths. The smallest size coils cost about $1.50 apiece and  the mounting costs about $6 or $7 each.    The A Battery Potentiometer.--This device is simply a resistance like  the rheostat described in connection with the preceding vacuum tube  receiving sets but it is wound to 200 or 300 ohms resistance as  against 1-1/2 to 6 ohms of the rheostat. It is, however, used as well  as the rheostat. With a vacuum tube detector, and especially with one  having a gas-content, a potentiometer is very necessary as it is only  by means of it that the potential of the plate of the detector can be  accurately regulated. The result of proper regulation is that when the  critical potential value is reached there is a marked increase in the  loudness of the sounds that are emitted by the head phones.    As you will see from A in Fig. 51 it has three taps. The two taps  which are connected with the ends of the resistance coil are shunted  around the A battery and the third tap, which is attached to the  movable contact arm, is connected with the B battery tap, see B, at  which this battery gives 18 volts. Since the A battery gives 6 volts  you can vary the potential of the plate from 18 to 24 volts. The  potentiometer must never be shunted around the B battery or the latter  will soon run down. A potentiometer costs a couple of dollars.    [Illustration: (A) Fig. 51.--The Use of the Potentiometer.]    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--For this regenerative set you  will need: (1) a _honeycomb_ or other compact _three-coil tuner_, (2)  two _variable_ (_.001_ and _.0005 mfd_.) _condensers_; (3) a _.00025  mfd. fixed condenser_; (4) a _1/2 to 2 megohm grid leak_; (5) a _tube  detector_; (6) a _6 volt A battery_; (7) _a rheostat_; (8) a  _potentiometer_; (9) an _18_ or _20 volt B battery_; (10) a _fixed  condenser_ of _.001 mfd. fixed condenser_; and (11) a _pair of 2000  ohm head phones_.    To wire up the parts connect the leading-in wire of the aerial with  the primary coil, which is the middle one of the tuner, and connect  the other terminal with the ground. Connect the ends of the secondary  coil, which is the middle one, with the posts of the variable  condenser and connect one of the posts of the latter with one post of  the fixed .00025 mfd. condenser and the other post of this with the  grid; then shunt the grid leak around it. Next connect the other post  of the variable condenser to the - or _negative_ electrode of the _A  battery_; the + or _positive_ electrode of this to one terminal of the  detector filament and the other end of the latter to the electrode of  the A battery.    Now connect one end of the tickler coil with the detector plate and  the other post to the fixed .001 mfd. condenser, then the other end of  this to the positive or carbon pole of the B battery.    This done shunt the potentiometer around the A battery and run a wire  from the movable contact of it (the potentiometer) over to the 18 volt  tap, (see B, Fig. 51), of the B battery.    Finally, shunt the head phones and the .001 mfd. fixed condenser and  you are ready to try out conclusions.    A Regenerative Audio Frequency Amplifier Receiving Set.--The use of  amateur regenerative cascade audio frequency receiving sets is getting  to be quite common. To get the greatest amplification possible with  amplifying tubes you have to keep a negative potential on the grids.  You can, however, get very good results without any special charging  arrangement by simply connecting one post of the rheostat with the  negative terminal of the filament and connecting the _low potential_  end of the secondary of the tuning coil with the - or negative  electrode of the A battery. This scheme will give the grids a negative  bias of about 1 volt. You do not need to bother about these added  factors that make for high efficiency until after you have got your  receiving set in working order and understand all about it.    The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.--Exactly the same parts are  needed for this set as the one described above, but in addition you  will want: (1) two more _rheostats_; (2) _two_ more sets of B 22-1/2  _volt batteries_; (3) _two amplifier tubes_, and (4) _two audio  frequency transformers_ as described in Chapter IX and pictured at A  in Fig. 46.    To wire up the parts begin by connecting the leading-in wire to one  end of the primary of the tuning coil and then connect the other end  of the coil with the ground. A variable condenser of .001 mfd.  capacitance can be connected in the ground wire, as shown in Fig. 52,  to good advantage although it is not absolutely needed. Now connect  one end of the secondary coil to one post of a _.001 mfd._ variable  condenser and the other end of the secondary to the other post of the  condenser.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.--Regenerative Audio Frequency Amplifier  Receiving Set.]    Next bring a lead (wire) from the first post of the variable condenser  over to the post of the first fixed condenser and connect the other  post of the latter with the grid of the detector tube. Shunt 1/2 to 2  megohm grid leak resistance around the fixed condenser and then  connect the second post of the variable condenser to one terminal of  the detector tube filament. Run this wire on over and connect it with  the first post of the second rheostat, the second post of which is  connected with one terminal of the filament of the first amplifying  tube; then connect the first post of the rheostat with one end of the  secondary coil of the first audio frequency transformer, and the other  end of this coil with the grid of the first amplifier tube.    Connect the lead that runs from the second post of variable condenser  to the first post of the third rheostat, the second post of which is  connected with one terminal of the second amplifying tube; then  connect the first post of the rheostat with one end of the secondary  coil of the second audio frequency transformer and the other end of  this coil with the grid of the second amplifier tube.    This done connect the - or negative electrode of the A battery  with the second post of the variable condenser and connect the + or  positive electrode with the free post of the first rheostat, the other  post of which connects with the free terminal of the filament of the  detector. From this lead tap off a wire and connect it to the free  terminal of the filament of the first amplifier tube, and finally  connect the end of the lead with the free terminal of the filament of  the second amplifier tube.    Next shunt a potentiometer around the A battery and connect the  third post, which connects with the sliding contact, to the negative  or zinc pole of a B battery, then connect the positive or  carbon pole of it to the negative or zinc pole of a second B  battery and the positive or carbon pole of the latter with one end of  the primary coil of the second audio frequency transformer and the  other end of it to the plate of the first amplifying tube. Run the  lead on over and connect it to one of the terminals of the second  fixed condenser and the other terminal of this with the plate of the  second amplifying tube. Then shunt the headphones around the  condenser.    Finally connect one end of the tickler coil of the tuner with the  plate of the detector tube and connect the other end of the tickler to  one end of the primary coil of the first audio frequency transformer  and the other end of it to the wire that connects the two B  batteries together.          CHAPTER XI    SHORT WAVE REGENERATIVE RECEIVING SETS      A _short wave receiving set_ is one that will receive a range of  wave lengths of from 150 to 600 meters while the distance over which  the waves can be received as well as the intensity of the sounds  reproduced by the headphones depends on: (1) whether it is a  regenerative set and (2) whether it is provided with amplifying tubes.    High-grade regenerative sets designed especially for receiving amateur  sending stations that must use a short wave length are built on the  regenerative principle just like those described in the last chapter  and further amplification can be had by the use of amplifier tubes as  explained in Chapter IX, but the new feature of these sets is the use  of the _variocoupler_ and one or more _variometers_. These tuning  devices can be connected up in different ways and are very popular  with amateurs at the present time.    Differing from the ordinary loose coupler the variometer has no  movable contacts while the variometer is provided with taps so that  you can connect it up for the wave length you want to receive. All you  have to do is to tune the oscillation circuits to each other is to  turn the _rotor_, which is the secondary coil, around in the _stator_,  as the primary coil is called in order to get a very fine variation of  the wave length. It is this construction that makes _sharp tuning_  with these sets possible, by which is meant that all wave lengths are  tuned out except the one which the receiving set is tuned for.    A Short Wave Regenerative Receiver--With One Variometer and Three  Variable Condensers.--This set also includes a variocoupler and a  _grid coil_. The way that the parts are connected together makes it a  simple and at the same time a very efficient regenerative receiver for  short waves. While this set can be used without shielding the parts  from each other the best results are had when shields are used.    The parts you need for this set include: (1) one _variocoupler_; (2)  one _.001 microfarad variable condenser_; (3) one _.0005 microfarad  variable condenser_; (4) one _.0007 microfarad variable condenser_;  (5) _one 2 megohm grid leak_; (6) one _vacuum tube detector_; (7) one  _6 volt A battery_; (8) one _6 ohm_, 1-1/2"]]]
