It may have been, too, that the organization was not quite correctly  planned. You see, if practically everybody is on the committees, it is  awfully hard to try to find men to canvass, and it is not allowable for  the captains and the committee men to canvass one another, because their  gifts are spontaneous. So the only thing that the different groups  could do was to wait round in some likely place--say the bar parlour  of Smith's Hotel--in the hope that somebody might come in who could be  canvassed.    You might ask why they didn't canvass Mr. Smith himself, but of course  they had done that at the very start, as I should have said. Mr. Smith  had given them two hundred dollars in cash conditional on the lunches  being held in the caff of his hotel; and it's awfully hard to get a  proper lunch I mean the kind to which a Bishop can express regret at not  being there--under a dollar twenty-five. So Mr. Smith got back his own  money, and the crowd began eating into the benefactions, and it got  more and more complicated whether to hold another lunch in the hope of  breaking even, or to stop the campaign.    It was disappointing, yes. In spite of all the success and the sympathy,  it was disappointing. I don't say it didn't do good. No doubt a lot of  the men got to know one another better than ever they had before. I have  myself heard Judge Pepperleigh say that after the campaign he knew  all of Pete Glover that he wanted to. There was a lot of that kind of  complete satiety. The real trouble about the Whirlwind Campaign was that  they never clearly understood which of them were the whirlwind and who  were to be the campaign.    Some of them, I believe, took it pretty much to heart. I know that Henry  Mullins did. You could see it. The first day he came down to the lunch,  all dressed up with the American Beauty and the white waistcoat. The  second day he only wore a pink carnation and a grey waistcoat. The third  day he had on a dead daffodil and a cardigan undervest, and on the last  day, when the high school teachers should have been there, he only wore  his office suit and he hadn't even shaved. He looked beaten.    It was that night that he went up to the rectory to tell the news to  Dean Drone. It had been arranged, you know, that the rector should not  attend the lunches, so as to let the whole thing come as a surprise;  so that all he knew about it was just scraps of information about the  crowds at the lunch and how they cheered and all that. Once, I believe,  he caught sight of the Newspacket with a two-inch headline: A QUARTER  OF A MILLION, but he wouldn't let himself read further because it would  have spoilt the surprise.    I saw Mullins, as I say, go up the street on his way to Dean Drone's.  It was middle April and there was ragged snow on the streets, and the  nights were dark still, and cold. I saw Mullins grit his teeth as he  walked, and I know that he held in his coat pocket his own cheque for  the hundred, with the condition taken off it, and he said that there  were so many skunks in Mariposa that a man might as well be in the Head  Office in the city.    The Dean came out to the little gate in the dark,--you could see the  lamplight behind him from the open door of the rectory,--and he shook  hands with Mullins and they went in together.          SIX. The Beacon on the Hill    Mullins said afterward that it was ever so much easier than he thought  it would have been. The Dean, he said, was so quiet. Of course if Mr.  Drone had started to swear at Mullins, or tried to strike him, it would  have been much harder. But as it was he was so quiet that part of the  time he hardly seemed to follow what Mullins was saying. So Mullins  was glad of that, because it proved that the Dean wasn't feeling  disappointed as, in a way, he might have.    Indeed, the only time when the rector seemed animated and excited in the  whole interview was when Mullins said that the campaign had been ruined  by a lot of confounded mugwumps. Straight away the Dean asked if those  mugwumps had really prejudiced the outcome of the campaign. Mullins  said there was no doubt of it, and the Dean enquired if the presence  of mugwumps was fatal in matters of endeavour, and Mullins said that  it was. Then the rector asked if even one mugwump was, in the Christian  sense, deleterious. Mullins said that one mugwump would kill anything.  After that the Dean hardly spoke at all.    In fact, the rector presently said that he mustn't detain Mullins too  long and that he had detained him too long already and that Mullins must  be weary from his train journey and that in cases of extreme weariness  nothing but a sound sleep was of any avail; he himself, unfortunately,  would not be able to avail himself of the priceless boon of slumber  until he had first retired to his study to write some letters; so that  Mullins, who had a certain kind of social quickness of intuition, saw  that it was time to leave, and went away.    It was midnight as he went down the street, and a dark, still night.  That can be stated positively because it came out in court afterwards.  Mullins swore that it was a dark night; he admitted, under examination,  that there may have been the stars, or at least some of the less  important of them, though he had made no attempt, as brought out on  cross-examination, to count them: there may have been, too, the electric  lights, and Mullins was not willing to deny that it was quite possible  that there was more or less moonlight. But that there was no light that  night in the form of sunlight, Mullins was absolutely certain. All that,  I say, came out in court.    But meanwhile the rector had gone upstairs to his study and had seated  himself in front of his table to write his letters. It was here always  that he wrote his sermons. From the window of the room you looked  through the bare white maple trees to the sweeping outline of the church  shadowed against the night sky, and beyond that, though far off, was  the new cemetery where the rector walked of a Sunday (I think I told you  why): beyond that again, for the window faced the east, there lay, at no  very great distance, the New Jerusalem. There were no better things that  a man might look towards from his study window, nor anything that could  serve as a better aid to writing.    But this night the Dean's letters must have been difficult indeed to  write. For he sat beside the table holding his pen and with his head  bent upon his other hand, and though he sometimes put a line or two on  the paper, for the most part he sat motionless. The fact is that Dean  Drone was not trying to write letters, but only one letter. He was  writing a letter of resignation. If you have not done that for forty  years it is extremely difficult to get the words.    So at least the Dean found it. First he wrote one set of words and then  he sat and thought and wrote something else. But nothing seemed to suit.    The real truth was that Dean Drone, perhaps more than he knew himself,  had a fine taste for words and effects, and when you feel that a  situation is entirely out of the common, you naturally try, if you have  that instinct, to give it the right sort of expression.    I believe that at the time when Rupert Drone had taken the medal  in Greek over fifty years ago, it was only a twist of fate that had  prevented him from becoming a great writer. There was a buried author in  him just as there was a buried financier in Jefferson Thorpe. In fact,  there were many people in Mariposa like that, and for all I know you may  yourself have seen such elsewhere. For instance, I am certain that Billy  Rawson, the telegraph operator at Mariposa, could easily have invented  radium. In the same way one has only to read the advertisements of Mr.  Gingham, the undertaker, to know that there is still in him a poet,  who could have written on death far more attractive verses than the  Thanatopsis of Cullen Bryant, and under a title less likely to offend  the public and drive away custom. He has told me this himself.    So the Dean tried first this and then that and nothing would seem to  suit. First of all he wrote:    \"It is now forty years since I came among you, a youth full of life and  hope and ardent in the work before me--\" Then he paused, doubtful of the  accuracy and clearness of the expression, read it over again and again  in deep thought and then began again:    \"It is now forty years since I came among you, a broken and melancholy  boy, without life or hope, desiring only to devote to the service of  this parish such few years as might remain of an existence blighted  before it had truly begun--\" And then again the Dean stopped. He read  what he had written; he frowned; he crossed it through with his pen.  This was no way to write, this thin egotistical strain of complaint.  Once more he started:    \"It is now forty years since I came among you, a man already tempered  and trained, except possibly in mathematics--\" And then again the rector  paused and his mind drifted away to the memory of the Anglican professor  that I spoke of, who had had so little sense of his higher mission as to  omit the teaching of logarithms. And the rector mused so long that  when he began again it seemed to him that it was simpler and better to  discard the personal note altogether, and he wrote:    \"There are times, gentlemen, in the life of a parish, when it comes to  an epoch which brings it to a moment when it reaches a point--\"    The Dean stuck fast again, but refusing this time to be beaten went  resolutely on:    \"--reaches a point where the circumstances of the moment make the epoch  such as to focus the life of the parish in that time.\"    Then the Dean saw that he was beaten, and he knew that he not only  couldn't manage the parish but couldn't say so in proper English, and of  the two the last was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#18)"],[1," itself was finished with slips and seats so calculated that by  slipping the seats a little the congregation could change their faces  toward either pulpit they chose; for in some cases the high Priesthood  would administer, and in other cases the lesser Priesthood would  administer. The room was also divided into four compartments by means  of curtains or veils hanging from the ceiling over head down to the  floor, which could be rolled up at pleasure, so that the house could  be used all in one or divided into four rooms and used for different  purposes. Thus the house was constructed to suit and accommodate the  different quorums of the Priesthood and worship peculiar to the  Church. The first story or lower room was dedicated for divine worship  alone. The second story was finished similar in form to the first, but  was designed wholly for instructing the Priesthood, and was supplied  with tables and seats instead of slips. In the attic, five rooms were  finished for the convenience of schools and for different quorums of  the Church to meet in. There was no baptismal font in this temple, the  ordinance of baptism for the dead not having been revealed.    \"At the time of dedication the first story was finished, also the  attic, but the second story was in an unfinished condition.    \"At the dedication an address was delivered by Elder Rigdon, from  Matthew 8th chap., 18th, 19th and 20th verses--more particularly the  20th. He spoke two hours and a half. The tenor of his discourse went  to show the toils, sufferings, privations, and hardships the brethren  and sisters had to endure while building this house, and compared it  with the sufferings of the Saints in the days of the Savior. After the  address the voice of the assembly was taken in reference to receiving  and upholding the several presidents of the different quorums in their  standing. The vote was unanimously in the affirmative in every  instance. A hymn was sung, and then we had an interesting address from  President Joseph Smith, and closed with a dedication prayer written by  the Prophet.    \"During the ceremonies of the dedication, an angel appeared and sat  near President Joseph Smith, sen., and Frederick G. Williams, so that  they had a fair view of his person. He was a very tall personage,  black eyes, white hair, and stoop shouldered; his garment was whole,  extending to near his ankles; on his feet he had sandals. He was sent  as a messenger to accept of the dedication. The Priesthood was  organized according to the proper order. During the whole of the  dedication each quorum was placed in its respective station.  Everything was conducted in the best of order, and profound silence  maintained.\"    The Temple having been dedicated, the Apostles and Elders received  their endowments, according to the promise of the Lord in Missouri.  Says Heber:    \"We had been commanded to prepare ourselves for a solemn assembly. At  length the time arrived for this assembly to meet; previous to which  the Prophet Joseph exhorted the Elders to solemnize their minds, by  casting away every evil from them, in thought, word and deed, and to  let their hearts become sanctified, because they need not expect a  blessing from God without being duly prepared for it, for the Holy  Ghost would not dwell in unholy temples. This meeting took place soon  after the house of the Lord had been dedicated. * * *    \"When the Prophet Joseph had finished the endowments of the First  Presidency, the Twelve and the Presiding Bishops, the First Presidency  proceeded to lay hands upon each one of them to seal and confirm the  anointing; and at the close of each blessing the whole of the quorums  responded to it with a loud shout of Hosanna! Hosanna! etc.    \"While these things were being attended to the beloved disciple John  was seen in our midst by the Prophet Joseph, Oliver Cowdery and  others. After this all the quorums arose in order, together with the  three Presidencies; and the Twelve then presented themselves  separately and individually before the First Presidency, with hands  uplifted towards heaven, and asked of God whatever they felt to  desire; and after each individual petition the whole of the quorums  answered aloud Amen! Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! To God and the Lamb,  forever and ever, amen and amen!    \"The 6th day of April being the day appointed for fasting and prayer,  all the Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons, numbering about four  hundred, met together in the House of the Lord to attend to further  ordinances; none being permitted to enter but official members who had  previously received their washings and anointings. Water being  provided, the First Presidency, after girding themselves with towels,  proceeded to wash the feet of the Twelve. After they got through the  Twelve girded themselves and washed the feet of the Seventies. They  then took their seats, each quorum seating themselves in their  respective places and continued in fasting and prayer, prophesying and  exhortation until evening. A sufficient quantity of bread having been  provided to feed this whole assembly, it was broken by the First  Presidency of the Church and Twelve, after which the congregation  knelt while a benediction was pronounced upon it by the First  Presidency; and afterwards the Twelve took it and administered to the  congregation. Then wine, also being provided, was blessed by the First  Presidency and in like manner served to the congregation by the  Twelve. This order of things is similar to that which was attended to  by the Savior, amongst His disciples, previous to His ascension. The  meeting continued on through the night; the spirit of prophecy was  poured out upon the assembly, and cloven tongues of fire sat upon  them; for they were seen by many of the congregation. Also angels  administered to many, for they were also seen by many.    \"This continued several days and was attended by a marvelous spirit of  prophecy. Every man's mouth was full of prophesying, and for a number  of days or weeks our time was spent in visiting from house to house,  administering bread and wine, and pronouncing blessings upon each  other to that degree, that from the external appearances one would  have supposed that the last days had truly come, in which the Spirit  of the Lord was poured out upon all flesh, as far as the Church was  concerned, for the sons and daughters of Zion were full of  prophesying. In this prophesying great blessings were pronounced upon  the faithful, and also great cursings upon the ungodly, or upon those  who had smitten us. During this time many great and marvelous visions  were seen, one of which I will mention which Joseph the Prophet had  concerning the Twelve. His anxiety was and had been very great for  their welfare, when the following vision was manifested to him, as  near as I can recollect:    \"He saw the Twelve going forth, and they appeared to be in a far  distant land. After some time they unexpectedly met together,  apparently in great tribulation, their clothes all ragged, and their  knees and feet sore. They formed into a circle, and all stood with  their eyes fixed upon the ground. The Savior appeared and stood in  their midst and wept over them, and wanted to show Himself to them,  but they did not discover Him. He (Joseph) saw until they had  accomplished their work, and arrived at the gate of the celestial  city; there Father Adam stood and opened the gate to them, and as they  entered he embraced them one by one and kissed them. He then led them  to the throne of God, and then the Savior embraced each one of them  and kissed them, and crowned each one of them in the presence of God.  He saw that they all had beautiful heads of hair and all looked alike.  The impression this vision left on Brother Joseph's mind was of so  acute a nature, that he never could refrain from weeping while  rehearsing it.\"    \"I continued through the winter,\" says Heber, \"some of the time going  to school, and the residue laboring with my hands, until May, 1836,  when I enquired of the Prophet Joseph if I should go on a mission to  preach, or go to school; he replied I might do either, for the Lord  would bless me in the course I should pursue. Accordingly, on the 10th  of May I left Kirtland and proceeded to Fairport, where I took  steamboat and arrived in Buffalo the next day. From that place I  passed on to the northeast, preaching where doors were open, and  baptizing for the remission of sins such as believed.    \"June 13th, I arrived at Sackett's Harbor. I had the pleasure of  meeting Brothers Luke Johnson and Orson Pratt, who were laboring with  all their might for the cause of God in that region.    \"From that place I went on the steamer _United States_ to Ogdensburg,  St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., and from thence passed on about three miles  from the village, when I was stopped by a shower of rain, which drove  me into the house of Mr. Chapin for shelter, and making known my  calling, the people immediately desired a meeting, and called in their  neighbors, when I preached to them for about an hour. Many staid until  midnight, and before I was up the next morning they called upon me  requesting I should preach again that day in the school house, which I  did, and at night it was again thronged with those who were eager to  hear. The second morning they likewise called on me, and would not let  me go until they knew the truth of my testimony, for by this time the  country round was in an uproar of excitement. On the fourth morning I  was called out of bed, and baptized three. I remained seven days  preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of Heaven, and baptized and  confirmed seven. The promise was fulfilled, for those who believed  spoke in tongues, and the sick were healed. A woman named Davis had  been confined to her bed for five years, not able to do anything  during that time, and scarcely able to sit up, who was given up to die  by the doctors."]]]
