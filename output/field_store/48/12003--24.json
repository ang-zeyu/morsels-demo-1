This belief rests on the common conviction that          mind and matter cooperate both visibly and invisibly,          hence that matter is intelligent.                            Poor post-mortem evidence    81:1    There is not so much evidence to prove intercommuni-          cation between the so-called dead and the living, as there  81:3    is to show the sick that matter suffers and has          sensation; yet this latter evidence is destroyed by          the Mind-science. If Spiritualists understood the  81:6    Science of being, their belief in mediumship would vanish.                             No proof of immortality            At the very best and on its own theories, spiritualism          can only prove that certain individuals have a continued  81:9    existence after death and maintain their affili-          ation with mortal flesh; but this fact affords          no certainty of everlasting life. A man's assertion that  81:12   he is immortal no more proves him to be so, than the op-          posite assertion, that he is mortal, would prove immor-          tality a lie. Nor is the case improved when alleged spirits  81:15   teach immortality. Life, Love, Truth, is the only proof          of immortality.                         Mind's manifestations immortal            Man in the likeness of God as revealed in Science can-  81:18   not help being immortal. Though the grass seemeth to          wither and the flower to fade, they reappear.          Erase the figures which express number, silence  81:21   the tones of music, give to the worms the body          called man, and yet the producing, governing, divine          Principle lives on, - in the case of man as truly as in  81:24   the case of numbers and of music, - despite the so-called          laws of matter, which define man as mortal. Though          the inharmony resulting from material sense hides the  81:27   harmony of Science, inharmony cannot destroy the divine          Principle of Science. In Science, man's immortality de-          pends upon that of God, good, and follows as a necessary  81:30   consequence of the immortality of good.                                Reading thoughts            That somebody, somewhere, must have known the          deceased person, supposed to be the communicator, is  82:1    evident, and it is as easy to read distant thoughts as near.          We think of an absent friend as easily as we do of one  82:3    present. It is no more difficult to read the          absent mind than it is to read the present.          Chaucer wrote centuries ago, yet we still read his thought  82:6    in his verse. What is classic study, but discernment of          the minds of Homer and Virgil, of whose personal exist-          ence we may be in doubt?                            Impossible intercommunion    82:9    If spiritual life has been won by the departed, they          cannot return to material existence, because different          states of consciousness are involved, and one  82:12   person cannot exist in two different states of          consciousness at the same time. In sleep we          do not communicate with the dreamer by our side despite  82:15   his physical proximity, because both of us are either un-          conscious or are wandering in our dreams through differ-          ent mazes of consciousness.    82:18   In like manner it would follow, even if our departed          friends were near us and were in as conscious a state of          existence as before the change we call death, that their  82:21   state of consciousness must be different from ours. We          are not in their state, nor are they in the mental realm          in which we dwell. Communion between them and  82:24   ourselves would be prevented by this difference. The          mental states are so unlike, that intercommunion is as          impossible as it would be between a mole and a human  82:27   being. Different dreams and different awakenings be-          token a differing consciousness. When wandering in          Australia, do we look for help to the Esquimaux in their  82:30   snow huts?            In a world of sin and sensuality hastening to a          greater development of power, it is wise earnestly to  83:1    consider whether it is the human mind or the divine          Mind which is influencing one. What the prophets of  83:3    Jehovah did, the worshippers of Baal failed to do; yet          artifice and delusion claimed that they could equal the          work of wisdom.    83:6    Science only can explain the incredible good and evil          elements now coming to the surface. Mortals must find          refuge in Truth in order to escape the error of these latter  83:9    days. Nothing is more antagonistic to Christian Science          than a blind belief without understanding, for such a          belief hides Truth and builds on error.                                 Natural wonders    83:12   Miracles are impossible in Science, and here Science          takes issue with popular religions. The scientific mani-          festation of power is from the divine nature  83:15   and is not supernatural, since Science is an          explication of nature. The belief that the universe, in-          cluding man, is governed in general by material laws, but  83:18   that occasionally Spirit sets aside these laws, - this be-          lief belittles omnipotent wisdom, and gives to matter the          precedence over Spirit.                             Conflicting standpoints    83:21   It is contrary to Christian Science to suppose that life          is either material or organically spiritual. Between          Christian Science and all forms of superstition  83:24   a great gulf is fixed, as impassable as that be-          tween Dives and Lazarus. There is mortal mind-reading          and immortal Mind-reading. The latter is a revelation  83:27   of divine purpose through spiritual understanding, by          which man gains the divine Principle and explanation of          all things. Mortal mind-reading and immortal Mind-  83:30   reading are distinctly opposite standpoints, from which          cause and effect are interpreted. The act of reading          mortal mind investigates and touches only human beliefs.  84:1    Science is immortal and coordinate neither with the          premises nor with the conclusions of mortal beliefs.                              Scientific foreseeing    84:3    The ancient prophets gained their foresight from a          spiritual, incorporeal standpoint, not by foreshadowing          evil and mistaking fact for fiction, - predict-  84:6    ing the future from a groundwork of corpo-          reality and human belief. When sufficiently advanced          in Science to be in harmony with the truth of being, men  84:9    become seers and prophets involuntarily, controlled not          by demons, spirits, or demigods, but by the one Spirit.          It is the prerogative of the ever-present, divine Mind, and  84:12   of thought which is in rapport with this Mind, to know          the past, the present, and the future.            Acquaintance with the Science of being enables us to  84:15   commune more largely with the divine Mind, to foresee          and foretell events which concern the universal welfare,          to be divinely inspired, - yea, to reach the range of fetter-  84:18   less Mind.                               The Mind unbounded            To understand that Mind is infinite, not bounded by          corporeality, not dependent upon the ear and eye for  84:21   sound or sight nor upon muscles and bones          for locomotion, is a step towards the Mind-          science by which we discern man's nature and existence.  84:24   This true conception of being destroys the belief of spirit-          ualism at its very inception, for without the concession of          material personalities called spirits, spiritualism has no  84:27   basis upon which to build.                             Scientific foreknowing            All we correctly know of Spirit comes from God, divine          Principle, and is learned through Christ and Christian  84:30   Science. If this Science has been thoroughly          learned and properly digested, we can know          the truth more accurately than the astronomer can read  85:1    the stars or calculate an eclipse. This Mind-reading          is the opposite of clairvoyance. It is the illumination of  85:3    the spiritual understanding which demonstrates the ca-          pacity of Soul, not of material sense. This Soul-sense          comes to the human mind when the latter yields to the  85:6    divine Mind.                               Value of intuition            Such intuitions reveal whatever constitutes and per-          petuates harmony, enabling one to do good, but not  85:9    evil. You will reach the perfect Science of          healing when you are able to read the human          mind after this manner and discern the error you would  85:12   destroy. The Samaritan woman said: \"Come, see a          man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this          the Christ?\"    85:15   It is recorded that Jesus, as he once journeyed with his          students, \"knew their thoughts,\" - read them scientifi-          cally. In like manner he discerned disease and healed  85:18   the sick. After the same method, events of great mo-          ment were foretold by the Hebrew prophets. Our          Master rebuked the lack of this power when he said:  85:21   \"O ye hypocrites! ye can discern the face of the sky;          but can ye not discern the signs of the times?\"                              Hypocrisy condemned            Both Jew and Gentile may have had acute corporeal  85:24   senses, but mortals need spiritual sense.

Among the subjects of the Vatican we do not find any  ascribed to Vincenzio, but we may perhaps assign to him the history of  Moses in Horeb, which Taja, on mere conjecture, ascribes to the bold  pencil of Raffaele del Colle, who was employed by Raffaello in the  Farnesina, and in the Hall of Constantine, under Giulio. Of this artist  and his successors we have spoken in the first book, where we have made  some additions to the account of Vasari.    Timoteo della Vite, of Urbino, after some years spent at Bologna in  studying under Francesco Francia, returned to his native city, and from  thence repaired to the academy which his countryman and relation  Raffaello had opened in the Vatican. He assisted Raffaello at the Pace,  in the fresco of the Sybils, of which he retained the cartoons; and  after some time, from some cause or other, he returned to Urbino, and  there passed the remainder of his days. He brought with him to Rome, a  method of painting which partook much of the manner of the early  masters, as may be seen in some of his Madonnas, at the palace  Bonaventura, and the chapter of Urbino; and in a Discovery of the Cross  in the church of the conventuals of Pesaro. He improved his style under  Raffaello, and acquired much of his grace, attitudes, and colour, though  he always remained a limited inventor, with a certain timidity of touch,  more correct than vigorous. The picture of the Conception at the  Osservanti of Urbino, and the Noli me Tangere, in the church of S.  Angelo, at Cagli, are the best pieces that remain of Timoteo. Pietro  della Vite, who is supposed to have been his brother, painted in the  same style, but in an inferior manner. This Pietro is, perhaps, the  relative and heir of Raffaello, whom Baldinucci mentions in his fifth  volume. The same writer affirms, at the end of his fourth volume, that  the artists of Urbino included amongst the scholars of Raffaello one  Crocchia, and assign to him a picture at the Capuchins in Urbino, of  which I have no further knowledge.    Benvenuto Tisi, of Ferrara, or as he is generally called, Il Garofalo,  also studied only a little time under Sanzio; but it was sufficient to  enable him to become, as we shall notice hereafter, the chief of the  Ferrarese School. He imitated Raffaello in design, in the character of  his faces, and in expression, and considerably also in his colouring,  although he added something of a warmer and stronger cast, derived from  his own school. Rome, Bologna, and other cities of Italy, abound with  his pictures from the lives of the apostles. They are of various merit,  and are not wholly painted by himself. In his large pictures he stands  more alone, and many of these are to be found in the Chigi gallery. The  Visitation in the Palazzo Doria, is one of the first pieces in that rich  collection. This artist was accustomed, in allusion to his name, to mark  his pictures with a violet, which the common people in Italy call  garofalo. It does not appear from Vasari, Titi, and Taja, that Garofalo  had any share in the works which were executed by Raffaello and his  scholars.    Gaudenzio Ferrari is mentioned by Titi, as an assistant of Raffaello in  the story of Psyche, and we shall advert to him again in another book as  chief of the Milanese School. Orlandi, on the credit of some more modern  writers, asserts, that he worked with Raffaello also at Torre Borgia;  and before that time, he considers him to have been a scholar of Scotto  and Perugino. In Florence, and in other places in Lower Italy, some  highly finished pictures are attributed to him, which partake of the  preceding century, though they do not seem allied to the school of  Perugino. Of these pictures we shall resume our notice hereafter; at  present it may be sufficient to remark, that in Lombardy, where he  resided, there is not a picture in that style to be found with his name  attached to it. He is always Raffaellesque, and follows the chiefs of  the Roman School.    Vasari also notices Jacomone da Faenza. This artist assiduously studied  the works of Raffaello, and from long practice in copying them, became  himself an inventor. He flourished in Romagna, and it was from him that  a Raffaellesque taste was diffused throughout that part of Italy. He is  also mentioned by Baldinucci, and we shall endeavour to make him better  known in his proper place.    Besides the above mentioned scholars and assistants of Raffaello,  several others are enumerated by writers, of whom we may give a short  notice. Il Pistoja, a scholar of Il Fattore, and probably employed by  him in the works of Sanzio, as Raffaellino del Colle was with Giulio, is  mentioned as a scholar of Raffaello by Baglione, and, on the credit of  that writer, also by Taja. We mentioned him among the Tuscans, and shall  further notice him in Naples, where we shall also find Andrea da  Salerno, head of that school, whom Dominici proves to be a scholar of  Raffaello.    In the _Memorie di Monte Rubbiano_, edited by Colucci, at page 10,  Vincenzo Pagani, a native of that country, is mentioned as a pupil of  the same master. There remains of him in the collegiate church there, a  most beautiful picture of the Assumption; and the Padre Civalli points  out another in Fallerone and two at Sarnano, in the church of his  religious fraternity, much extolled, and in a Raffaellesque manner, if  we are to credit report. This painter, of whom, in Piceno, I find traces  to the year 1529, again appears in Umbria in 1553, where Lattanzio his  son, being elected a magistrate of Perugia, he transferred himself  thither, and was employed to paint the altarpiece of the Cappella degli  Oddi, in the church of the Conventuals, as we have already mentioned.  According to the conditions of the contract, Paparelli had a share with  him in this work, and he must be considered as an assistant of Vincenzo,  both because he is named as holding the second place, and because he is  reported by Vasari on other occasions, as having been an assistant. But  as history mentions nothing relative to this picture, except the  contract, we shall content ourselves with observing, that this  praiseworthy artist, who was passed over in silence for so many years,  still painted in the year 1553. Whether he was a scholar of Raffaello,  or whether this was a tradition which arose in his own country in  progress of time, supported only on the consideration of his age and his  style, is a point to be decided by proofs of more authority than those  we possess. I agree with the Sig. Arciprete Lazzari, when, writing of F.  Bernardo Catelani of Urbino, who painted in Cagli the picture of the  great altar in the church of the Capucins, he says, that he had there  exhibited the style of the school of Raffaello, but he does not consider  him his scholar.    It has been asserted, that Marcantonio Raimondi painted some pictures  from the sketches of Raffaello, in a style which excited the admiration  of the designer himself; but this appears doubtful, and is so considered  by Malvasia. L'Armenini also assigns to this school, Scipione Sacco, a  painter of Cesena, and Orlandi, Don Pietro da Bagnaja, whom we shall  mention in the Romagna School. Some have added to it Bernardino Lovino,  and others Baldassare Peruzzi, a supposition which we shall shew to be  erroneous. Padre della Valle has more recently revived an opinion, that  Correggio may be ranked in the same school, and that he was probably  employed in the gallery, and might have painted the subject of the Magi,  attributed by Vasari to Perino. This is conjectured from the peculiar  smile of the mother and the infant. But these surmises and conjectures  we may consider as the chaff of that author, who has nevertheless  presented us with much substantial information. We shall now advert to  the foreigners of this school. Bellori has enumerated, among the  imitators of Raffaello, Michele Cockier, or Cocxie, of Malines, of whom  there remain some pictures in fresco in the church dell'Anima. Being  afterwards in Flanders, where several works of Raffaello were engraved  by Cock, he was accused of plagiarism, but still maintained a  considerable reputation; as to a fertile invention he added a graceful  style of execution. Many of his best pictures passed into Spain, and  were there purchased at great prices. Palomino acquaints us with another  excellent scholar of Sanzio, Pier Campanna, of Flanders, who, although  he could not entirely divest himself of the hardness of his native  school, was still highly esteemed in his day. He resided twenty years in  Italy, and was employed in Venice by the Patriarch Grimani, for whom he  painted several portraits, and the celebrated picture of the Magdalen  led by Saint Martha to the Temple, to hear the preaching of Christ. This  picture, which was bequeathed by the Patriarch to a friend, after a  lapse of many years, passed into the hands of Mr. Slade, an English  gentleman. Pier Campanna distinguished himself in Bologna, by painting a  triumphal arch on the arrival of Charles V., by whom he was invited to  Seville, where he resided a considerable time, painting and instructing  pupils, among whom is reckoned Morales, who, from his countrymen, had  the appellation of the divine. He was accustomed to paint small  pictures, which were eagerly sought after by the English, and  transferred to their country, where they are highly prized. Of his  altarpieces, several remain in Seville, and we may mention the  Purification, in the Cathedral, and the Deposition at S. Croce, as the  most esteemed. Murillo, who was himself a truly noble artist, greatly  admired and studied this latter picture, which, even after we have seen  the masterpieces of the Italian School, still excites our astonishment  and admiration. This artist, to some one, who, in his latter years,  inquired why he so often repaired to this"]]]
