Moses was a priest and lawgiver, and had to do with the temporal and  spiritual affairs of his subjects. Moses sought to unite church and  state, in obedience to the command of God. Joshua was also a priest  and ruler, and united both temporal and spiritual interests in his  government. David was a priest and king, and likewise Solomon, his  son. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were as much directed, by God, in  their temporal concerns or movements as they were in their spiritual  devotions. Jesus Christ came to establish a temporal kingdom fully  as much as a spiritual kingdom. Both Jews and Romans suspected his  designs, and charged him with the crime of treason. They said that he  called himself a King. Some will say that he explicitly declared that  His kingdom was not of this world. True: He did make this declaration;  but what does it prove? It proves simply, that this world was not  the father, author, or origin of His kingdom. His kingdom was from  _heaven_, and He had come here for the very important purpose of  establishing it on the _earth_. He called it kingdom of heaven, in  distinction from kingdoms that were of earthly origin.    It is strange, indeed, that the sectarian clergy should borrow the  idea that His kingdom was not a temporal kingdom as well as spiritual.  It was the prayer of His heart, and the prayer that He taught His  disciples, that God would establish His kingdom on earth, and cause  His will to be done here as it is done in heaven. Consequently, he  organized the kingdom here after the pattern of heaven, with all proper  officers, and laws suited to every temporal and spiritual occasion, and  then gave commandment that all nations should yield allegiance to the  laws and authorities established, and also submit themselves to the  ordinances of His Kingdom. And being in possession of living teachers,  even the word of inspired men, they (all mankind, if they would obey)  would be thoroughly furnished to \"_every good word and work_.\" In  other words, they would know how to act in every calling and sphere of  business, whether temporal or spiritual.    Jesus Christ did not design that his servants should fight one another,  or fight and conquer mankind into allegiance to Him. The world would  act on these principles through disobedience, but his disciples would  not, because they were shown a better way to universal dominion and  government.    The priesthood being an office of great responsibility, is guarded  rigidly against intruders. Man may lawfully desire this office, but  he has no right to take it of himself, but he must first be called  and appointed to it as Aaron was, by God, through a prophetic voice.  Neither is man required to study, and artificially qualify himself for  receiving it. God takes men as they are, and with the gift of priestly  office He bestows the requisite qualifications. The ordination of  heaven put upon the head of any man, however ignorant, is a voucher for  requisite qualification and blessing. Every man is thereby thoroughly  furnished for the discharge of all the duties of his respective  calling. They are not all apostles, however, neither are all prophets  or pastors. But every one has his calling of God, and in the legitimate  sphere of that calling he acts as God, and in the authority of God.    Some have authority only to baptize unto repentance for remission of  sins, as John the Baptist. Such can confer no more authority than  they possess in themselves. Others have authority to bless, and whom  they bless are blessed in very deed. They have similar authority to  curse, and whom they curse are cursed in very deed. Jacob blessed his  sons, and the heavens sealed and confirmed the same upon their heads.  Paul cursed Elymas, the sorcerer, with blindness, and the same curse  was sealed and confirmed upon him immediately. Elisha cursed Gehazi,  his servant, and leprosy cleaved to him from that time. Elijah shut  up the windows of heaven that it rained not for the space of three  years and six months, by the same delegated power, and again they were  opened at his voice. He was a man of like passions with ourselves. All  men are not ordained to this power, and when they are not, they are  wholly incapable of exercising it. It is office that gives recognition  and legality to a deed of conveyance and ownership. It is divine  appointment and official calling that gives efficacy to the priesthood.  But many generations have contented themselves to preach and support  preachers who have no divine appointment.    The consequence is, that men have been self-appointed to the ministry  and spread dissention and confusion abroad. The knowledge of the true  and living God has gradually receded from the earth, and darkness,  even gross darkness, covered the people. The ordinances that impart  healing virtue and the power and light of truth, have either been  changed or abolished. The apostolic office has been counted as a thing  out of date, and the spiritual gifts as being done away. The religious  world has been too much like King Saul. After he had been forsaken of  God, and the power and Spirit of his anointing given to David, this  unhappy monarch resorted to every miserable device, (even to the aid of  witches), in order to obtain knowledge and influence. But the curse of  disobedience followed him to the day of his death.    The religious sects, in like manner, have resorted to seminaries  and the polish of schools--also to the theological comments of  time-honoured fathers, (who were as ignorant as themselves) ever  learning, yet never coming to the knowledge of truth. Bibles have  been translated again and again; learned volumes have been written  in explanation, and even wars have been instigated by the supposed  defenders of the faith, and the earth crimsoned by human gore. All  these evils and curses have arisen from a spurious priesthood.    In view of these things, is it not time, sir, to let God resume the  reins of government and once more establish a holy priesthood, which  shall be after the calling of Aaron, and after the order and power of  endless life. That this may be the unfeigned choice of all who seek  after God, is the continued prayer of    Your old friend and servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER X.    ON GATHERING.    _Liverpool, October 13_, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--You have doubtless been ready to ask, time and  again, why this GATHERING together of such large bodies of Saints? Why  can they not stay in their former residences, like other christians?  And may they not do more good to their fellow-men by scattering about  amongst the people promiscuously? Why, go away off to some distant  part of the earth? is not the Almighty God to be found as much in one  place as another? Furthermore, says one, it is exceedingly dangerous to  community at large to allow any large body of people, of the same faith  and doctrine, to assemble themselves in any one place, their influence  being rendered formidable by reason of concentration and union.    My dear sir, have not cogitations like these passed through your  mind, and been reiterated in your hearing more than once, concerning  Latter-day Saints? Delusion! delusion! is reiterated on many sides.  What can these Latter-day Saints mean--selling out their possessions at  so great a sacrifice, and leaving a comfortable and pleasant home for a  far distant land, even crossing the wide Atlantic! Has there been the  like fanaticism since the time of the crusades? On the land, hundreds  of wagons, yea thousands in all, are seen rolling their whitened canvas  over the wide prairies, accompanied by their flocks and herds; and on  the ocean a multitude of ships are wafting the inhabitants of distant  islands and continents to the same destination!    Now, I propose to meet these inquiries and reflections promptly and  fairly. In the first place, if the church is guided by the spirit of  revelation, God, the author of all true revelation, knows what is good  for his people, and He will not require them to _gather_ without good  and sufficient reasons. For the church that is not guided by the spirit  of sacred inspiration, is guided by mammon or the devil; for every  church will serve God or mammon. Well, says one, I don't believe that  God ever did, or ever will, require people to gather together and leave  their country and kindred. Aye, indeed; but you believe the Bible, I  trust, which informs you not only how God _has_ gathered his people  in different periods of the world, but also, that He will gather them  together in the dispensation of the fulness of times.    Do I need to remind you, sir, that God required Abraham to rise up and  leave his country and kindred, and go in search of a country that he  should afterwards show him. He was obedient, and went from one country  to another, the Lord being his counsellor and guide. The ancient  saints and prophets generally were \"strangers\" in consequence of being  called to leave their home and country. Their obedience to such a  call, through faith, constituted them heirs of an inheritance. Abraham  became an heir of the country which he was not permitted to possess in  time, but he will hold the same in eternity, with a city built upon it  according to the counsel of God.    In the dispensation given to Moses, he was required to gather the  people out of all the land of Egypt, and take them to the land  of Canaan; and what was very remarkable, he was required to slay  and destroy the inhabitants, in order to make room for the great  _gathering_ of the Hebrews. The children of God and the people of this  world cannot dwell together; they are always contrary one to the other.    What fellowship hath Christ with Belial, or believers with unbelievers?  The Egyptians could have no fellowship with the Hebrews after they  were told that a prophet had sprung up among them. The Hebrews told  a marvellous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#18)"],[1," as  a _municipium_, while Livy also casually implies its possession of the  Latin franchise. Such _obiter dicta_ do not go for very much. Scholars  sometimes get astray in these times from forgetting that, not only  casual sayings, but even formal documents, may sometimes err. Thus  not long ago we saw a solemn paper in which a public officer, bound to  accuracy, a clerk of the peace, had to describe several towns in the  West of England. We here read of \"the county of the city of Bristol,\"  the \"borough of Gloucester,\" the \"borough of Bath,\" and the \"borough of  Taunton.\" An inquirer some ages hence might be misled into forgetting  that Bath is a \"city\" and Gloucester even a \"county of a city.\" May  we not sometimes get wrong about _municipia_ and Latin colonies from  the same kind of cause? Ferentinum was not, in the strict sense, a  _municipium_, but an allied Hernican commonwealth. In the like sort,  we once saw an official document from a high sheriff calling on the  electors of a county to elect, not a \"knight of the shire,\" as they  had done for six hundred years, but a hitherto unheard-of being called  a \"member of Parliament.\" Is it not possible then that Livy, and  even Cicero, may sometimes use a wrong phrase in talking of tribes,  _curiae_, and centuries, in ages long before their own day?    The walls then, though called \"Roman\" in a vague sense--that is, it  would seem, simply not primaeval, like those of Cori and Segni--are  doubtless Hernican in the sense of being built while Ferentinum was  still a separate Hernican community. The walls that we see are most  likely the walls over which the unlucky quaestor threw himself. The  walls of the _arx_, where we read the legend of Hirtius and Lollius,  connect the Hernican town with later times. Just at the point where the  inscription is they are carried up to form the Bishop's palace, and  from the middle of one side rises the bell-tower of the cathedral--a  very good example of the usual Romanesque type of such buildings.  The church of Ferentino is small and unpretending, and a good deal  damaged within, but it still keeps its main features, not only its  bell-tower, but its west front, its apses, its ranges of windows. A  little restoration, in the true sense of the word, would soon make  it into as good a specimen of its own class as could be needed. But,  unless we altogether misunderstood the words of one of its own clergy,  antiquity and simplicity are not esteemed at Ferentino. The little  minster is convicted of the crime of being old, a charge which, except  by comparison with the walls beneath it, cannot be denied. Only, if  the church be an offender on this score, how fearful must be the crime  of the walls? Unless we misunderstood in the most amazing way what  we heard with our own ears, the church of Ferentino, convicted of the  crime of old age, is sentenced to destruction. A new church is actually  begun; when it is finished the old one is to go. Happily the new one as  yet stands still for want of funds; let us hope that funds may refuse  to drop in till a wiser Bishop and Chapter shall rule at Ferentino.    The church at Ferentino is dedicated to Saint Ambrose, who may be seen  there in the worldly garb of the unbaptized prefect, before the infant  voice greeted him as Bishop of Milan. And in the inner buildings of the  _arx_--buildings most worthy of a visit on their own account--strange  tales lurk of the sufferings of the saint, which seem to find no place  either in history or in received legend. Among other things he was  thrown into a boiling caldron. Down below is another church _Santa  Maria Maggiore_, some centuries younger than the cathedral, and a  very pretty example of its style; which, as far as we know, no one  designs to destroy. Singularly graceful, but singularly un-Italian,  it strikes by the power of contrast, as it rises above the walls, or  as we go up to it from the gate which shares its surname. A few other  ecclesiastical and domestic scraps may also be picked up in the city  of the rock. The primitive remains are the great object in all these  places; but it is always a gain when the walls shelter something which  has an interest of another kind. The walls of the stout-hearted people  who chose rather to be citizens of Ferentinum than citizens of Rome  lose nothing by having been turned to an unlooked-for use as the holy  places of their successors, perhaps descendants, of another age and  another creed.          III. Alatri.      The tale of those Hernican cities, fenced in with primaeval walls, among  which we have been lately sojourning, is worthily brought to an end at  Alatri. Among its immediate Hernican fellows that town must certainly  claim the highest place; it might on some grounds claim the highest  place, even if we throw in Old-Latin and Volscian rivals. Yet it is  the one which has the least history. There is very little to say about  it, except that Alatrium, like Ferentinum, was faithful to Rome, but  preferred to keep its separate Hernican being rather than accept the  proffered reward of Roman citizenship. It therefore doubtless remained  a distinct commonwealth down to the Social War. And here at least  there can be no question about dates. Alatri is not especially rich  in mediaeval antiquities; it has still less claim to be called rich  in Roman antiquities. Nor does it supply us with the work of more or  less Romanized Hernicans, like the censors of Ferentinum. At Alatri  nearly everything that we care about is strictly primaeval. We cannot  reasonably doubt that both the circuits of wall at which we now look  were there in the days of Spurius Cassius, and were by no means new  then.    Alatri seems to have been somewhat of an out-of-the-way place in  all ages. Not lying on any of the great roads of Italy, it has no  place in the Itineraries, and now it lies much further than Anagni  or Ferentino--nay, even than Cori and Norba, from common tracks of  going and from the common haunts of men. Yet it cannot be looked  on as seriously inaccessible; it may at least be reached without  calling in the help of asses and mules. The party whose track we are  now following--a party, be it noticed, numbering two ladies among  them--reached Alatri in a carriage from Frosinone, having slept there  after seeing Ferentino. The old Hernican town of Frusino had scant  justice done to it by our wayfarers; as no man or book had pointed  it out as a seat of primitive walls, it was treated merely as a  resting-place between the wonders of Ferentino and the wonders of  Alatri. Frosinone was slept in, but was not examined; yet a glance from  its railway station, the point which connects Alatri with the modern  world, shows that it at least possesses a by no means contemptible  bell-tower. From Frosinone then our travellers made their way to  Alatri, and, as Alatri gradually rose before them, they were for  a while puzzled, perhaps for a while even disappointed, with what  they saw. But it was not for lack of a striking object to crown the  Alatrian hill-top. Of all the walls of our series, the inner range of  the walls of Alatri, the walls which fence in the _arx_, are the most  prominent in a distant view. Even the circuit of empty Norba, beyond  our immediate range, hardly outdoes these defences of a still inhabited  town. At Alatri indeed the primaeval walls are so prominent that in the  distant view no one would suspect them of being primaeval walls at all.  They are still so nearly perfect that they can and do discharge what  may be looked on as a survival of their original function. They still  fence in the innermost and loftiest quarter of the town, where, as  in so many other cases, the ancient citadel has become the episcopal  precinct. But at Alatri the episcopal precinct puts on a distinct and  central character which is rarely found in Italian cities. The _arx_  is not in a corner, but in the middle; the lower town, fenced in by the  wall of its own outer circuit, lies around it on every side. The _arx_  forms an open, lofty, and airy platform, looking forth from every point  of the compass on the mountains which keep watch around--on the little  towns, Veroli among them, perched here and there on their heights--on  the houses and churches of Alatri, covering the slope of the hill  which the _arx_ crowns. It is seldom that we find in an Italian town a  church or any other building standing in this way free on a commanding  site, not hemmed in on any side by parasitical buildings. These  hill-towns are perhaps better off in this respect than most others;  at Anagni, at Ferentino, the cathedral churches stand grandly on their  heights, comparatively free from all buildings except their own proper  companions. But there is not the wide, open space around them which  surrounds the church of Alatri. One cannot help wishing that some more  worthy building, either the primaeval temple itself or some more fitting  successor, occupied so noble a site, a site in truth which needs--let  us say either the Parthenon of Athens or the Parthenon of Lincoln to  do it justice. But the only thing that can be said for the cathedral  church of Alatri is that the lower part of its wall is part of the  _cella_ of the primaeval temple. Here we have something even more than  can be seen at Segni. We know not what may have been added in the way  of a pillared front; but it is plain that, as far as the main walls are  concerned, the building which was transformed into a Christian church  was actually the house of pagan worship itself. And it was a house  going back, not to dated Emperors or consuls, but to the unrecorded  age which reared these cities great and fenced up to heaven. There  is the terrace, there is the wall of the _cella_, wrought of the same  wonderful masonry as the walls of the surrounding _arx_, as the walls  of the yet again surrounding city. It is strange indeed to see the  ordinary rites of"]]]
