I'll tell  you a story, only be quiet a little while.\"    It took Peggy's utmost effort to keep the little wriggler still for the  hour from five to six. Then, however, her shrill, \"Merry Ch'is'mus!\"  roused the household. Protests were of no avail. Minna was the only  granddaughter. Dark as it was, people must get up.    Peggy must dress Minna and then hurry down to help get breakfast--not  so easy a task with Minna ever at one's heels. The quick-moving sprite  seemed to be everywhere--into the sugar-bowl, the cooky jar, the  steaming teakettle--before one could turn about. Urged on by the  impatient little girl, the grown-ups made short work of breakfast.    After the meal, according to time-honoured Brower custom, they formed  in procession, single file, Minna first, then Ben with Baby Robin. They  each held aloft a sprig of holly, and they all kept time as they sang,  \"God rest you, merry gentlemen,\" in their march from the dining-room to  the office. And there they must form in circle about the tree, and dance  three times round, singing \"The Christmas-tree is an evergreen,\" before  they could touch a single present.    The presents are done up according to custom, packages of every shape  and size, but all in white paper and tied with red ribbon, and all  marked for somebody with somebody else's best love. They all fall to  opening, and the babies' shouts are not the only ones to be heard.    Passers-by smile indulgently at the racket, remembering that all the  Browers are home for Christmas, and the Browers were ever a jovial  company.    Peggy gazes at her gifts quietly, but with shining eyes--little gold  cuff pins from Hazen, just like Arna's; a set of furs from Mabel and  Ben; but she likes Arna's gift best of all, a complete set of her  favourite author.    But much as they would like to linger about the Christmas tree, Peggy  and her mother, at least, must remember that the dishes must be washed  and the beds made, and that the family must get ready for church. Peggy  does not go to church, and nobody dreams how much she wants to go. She  loves the Christmas music. No hymn rings so with joy as:    Jerusalem triumphs, Messiah is king.    The choir sings it only once a year, on the Christmas morning. Besides,  her chum Esther will be at church, and Peggy has been too busy to go to  see her since she came home from boarding-school for the holidays. But  somebody must stay at home, and that somebody who but Peggy? Somebody  must baste the turkey and prepare the vegetables and take care of the  babies.    Peggy is surprised to find how difficult it is to combine dinner-getting  with baby-tending. When she opens the oven-door, there is Minna's head  thrust up under her arm, the inquisitive little nose in great danger by  reason of sputtering gravy.    \"Minna,\" protests Peggy, \"you mustn't eat another bit of candy!\" and  Minna opens her mouth in a howl, prolonged, but without tears and  without change of colour. Robin joins in, he does not know why. Peggy is  a doting aunt, but an honest one. She is vexed by a growing conviction  that Mabel's babies are sadly spoiled. Peggy is ashamed of herself;  surely she ought to be perfectly happy playing with Minna and Robin.  Instead, she finds that the thing she would like best of all to be doing  at this moment, next to going to church, would be to be lying on her  father's couch in the office, all by herself, reading.    The dinner is a savoury triumph for Peggy and her mother. The gravy and  the mashed potato are entirely of Peggy's workmanship, and Peggy has had  a hand in most of the other dishes, too, as the mother proudly tells.  How that merry party can eat! Peggy is waitress, and it is long before  the passing is over, and she can sit down in her own place. She is  just as fond of the unusual Christmas good things as are the rest,  but somehow, before she is well started at her turkey, it is time for  changing plates for dessert, and before she has tasted her nuts and  raisins the babies have succumbed to sleepiness, and it is Peggy who  must carry them upstairs for their nap--just in the middle of one of  Hazen's funniest stories, too.    And all the time the little sister is so ready, so quickly serviceable,  that somehow nobody notices--nobody but the doctor. It is he who finds  Peggy, half as hour later, all alone in the kitchen. The mother and the  older daughters are gathered about the sitting-room hearth, engaged in  the dear, delicious talk about the little things that are always left  out of letters.    The doctor interrupts them.    \"Peggy is all alone,\" he says.    \"But we're having such a good talk,\" the mother pleads, \"and Peggy will  be done in no time! Peggy is so handy!\"    \"Well, girls?\" is all the doctor says, with quiet command in his eyes,  and Peggy is not left to wash the Christmas dishes all alone. Because  she is smiling and her cheeks are bright, her sisters do not notice that  her eyes are wet, for Peggy is hotly ashamed of certain thoughts and  feelings that she cannot down. She forgets them for a while, however,  sitting on the hearth-rug, snuggled against her father's knee in the  Christmas twilight.    Yet the troublesome thoughts came back in the evening, when Peggy sat  upstairs in the dark with Minna, vainly trying to induce the excited  little girl to go to sleep, while bursts of merriment from the family  below were always breaking in upon the two in their banishment.    There was another restless night of it with the little niece, and  another too early waking. Everybody but Minna was sleepy enough, and  breakfast was a protracted meal, to which the \"children\" came down  slowly one by one. Arna did not appear at all, and Peggy carried up to  her the daintiest of trays, all of her own preparing. Arna's kiss of  thanks was great reward. It was dinner-time before Peggy realized it,  and she had hoped to find a quiet hour for her Latin.    The dreadful regent's examination was to come the next week, and Peggy  wanted to study for it. She had once thought of asking Arna to help her,  but Arna seemed so tired.    In the afternoon Esther came to see her chum, and to take her  home with her to spend the night. The babies, fretful with  after-Christmas-crossness, were tumbling over their aunt, and sadly  interrupting confidences, while Peggy explained that she could not go  out that evening. All the family were going to the church sociable, and  she must put the babies to bed.    \"I think it's mean,\" Esther broke in. \"Isn't it your vacation as well as  theirs? Do make that child stop pulling your hair!\"    If Esther's words had only not echoed through Peggy's head as they did  that night! \"But it is so mean of me, so mean of me, to want my own  vacation!\" sobbed Peggy in the darkness. \"I ought just to be glad  they're all at home.\"    Her self-reproach made her readier than ever to wait on them all the  next morning. Nobody could make such buckwheat cakes as could Mrs.  Brower; nobody could turn them as could Peggy. They were worth coming  from New York and Baltimore and Ohio to eat. Peggy stood at the griddle  half an hour, an hour, two hours. Her head was aching. Hazen, the latest  riser, was joyously calling for more.    At eleven o'clock Peggy realized that she had had no breakfast herself,  and that her mother was hurrying her off to investigate the lateness of  the butcher. Her head ached more and more, and she seemed strangely slow  in her dinner-getting and dish-washing. Her father was away, and there  was no one to help in the clearing-up. It was three before she had  finished.    Outside the sleigh-bells sounded enticing. It was the first sleighing of  the season. Mabel and Ben had been off for a ride, and Arna and Hazen,  too. How Peggy longed to be skimming over the snow instead of polishing  knives all alone in the kitchen. Sue Cummings came that afternoon to  invite Peggy to her party, given in Esther's honour. Sue enumerated six  other gatherings that were being given that week in honour of Esther's  visit home. Sue seemed to dwell much on the subject. Presently Peggy,  with hot cheeks, understood why. Everybody was giving Esther a party,  everybody but Peggy herself. Esther's own chum, and all the other girls,  were talking about it.    Peggy stood at the door to see Sue out, and watched the sleighs fly by.  Out in the sitting-room she heard her mother saying, \"Yes, of course we  can have waffles for supper. Where's Peggy?\" Then Peggy ran away.    In the wintry dusk the doctor came stamping in, shaking the snow from  his bearskins. As always, \"Where's Peggy?\" was his first question.    Peggy was not to be found, they told him. They had been all over the  house, calling her. They thought she must have gone out with Sue. The  doctor seemed to doubt this. He went through the upstairs rooms, calling  her softly. But Peggy was not in any of the bedrooms, or in any of the  closets, either. There was still the kitchen attic to be tried.    There came a husky little moan out of its depths, as he whispered,  \"Daughter!\" He groped his way to her, and sitting down on a trunk,  folded her into his bearskin coat.    \"Now tell father all about it,\" he said. And it all came out with  many sobs--the nights and dawns with Minna, the Latin, the sleighing,  Esther's party, breakfast, the weariness, the headache; and last the  waffles, which had moved the one unbearable thing.    \"And it is so mean of me, so mean of me!\" sobbed Peggy. \"But, oh, daddy,  I do want a vacation!\"    \"And you shall have one,\" he answered.    He carried her straight into her own room, laid her down on her own bed,  and tumbled Hazen's things into the hall. Then he went downstairs and  talked to his family.    Presently the mother came stealing in, bearing a glass of medicine the  doctor-father had sent. Then she undressed Peggy and put her to bed as  if she had been a baby, and sat by, smoothing her hair, until she fell  asleep.

But I cannot do that. His place is  here. There is a great work for him to do. He....\"    The Sumatran paused to chuckle, and then leaned forward in a  confidential attitude.    \"I will suggest a request you make to General Kashomia as part of your  reward,\" he said. \"Ask that you be allowed to fly in one of his bombing  planes on the day the blow falls. When you come over Singapore you  will see a sight no man may ever see again. The approach of the first  Japanese bomber will be the signal for my R.A.F. friend. Everything  is planned. His hand will push a cleverly hidden detonating plunger  and the buried fuel stores here on Singapore Island, the ammunition  stores, the hidden water reservoirs, and many other things will explode  in one blinding flash that will make Singapore shake from one end of  the Island to the other. Yes, from the very hangars of R.A.F. Base my  friend will push the plunger that will.... But why try to describe the  sight it will be? There are not enough words. However, I suggest that  you request General Kashomia to let you view the sight from a Japanese  bomber in the air. It will be something you will never forget.  Something to tell your Fuehrer when you return to Germany in triumph.  And now, get what rest you can, and study well that map. Meanwhile  I will fetch you food and drink to sustain your strength during the  journey ahead.\"    Dave just nodded as the Sumatran glanced questioningly at him and rose  to his feet. Words he might say gagged in his throat. His head whirled  in an invisible mass of white flame, and every ounce of blood seemed  to drain from his body. The words that had passed from Serrangi's lips  during the last half hour, or so, were so stunning, so brain numbing  that he could hardly force thoughts to register. It was like something  he might be reading out of a book thriller. Not something that was to  happen in real life. It couldn't be ... but it was. Doom, terrible  certain doom, hovered over Britain's mighty armed outpost of Singapore.  Hovered above it to come crashing down when a certain Japanese general  at Raja, in Burma, gave the signal.    \"It can't happen!\" Dave said fiercely to himself as Serrangi glided  past him toward the rear of the rug shop. \"Dear God, please, it mustn't  happen!\"          CHAPTER TWELVE    _Wings of Chaos_      Dave pressed himself flat to the ground, and dug his fingers into the  soft earth as though to prevent some invisible force from catching him  up and tossing him off into space. All about was pitch darkness save  for a few hangar lights on the far side of Singapore's R.A.F. Base.  High overhead billions and billions of stars winked solemnly down on a  world seemingly gone stark raving mad with war. In the distance there  was sound, but it was so jumbled and so indistinct that it had no  meaning for listening ears. For a brief instant Dave closed his eyes  tight and pressed his face hard against the warm ground. Then he raised  his head and turned it toward Freddy Farmer who hugged the ground right  at his side.    \"You're fully awake, aren't you, Freddy?\" he whispered. \"This wouldn't  be any cockeyed nightmare I'm going through, would it?\"    \"A blasted fine chance of that!\" the English youth replied with a  groan. \"I'm trying to make up my mind whether we're completely balmy,  or just off our toppers. This is a mad business, Dave! Insane!\"    \"You're not telling me a thing!\" Dawson breathed and squinted across  the night blackened R.A.F. Base at the faint hangar lights. \"But the  heck of it is, we walked right into it, and we can't walk right out  again!\"    \"If we could only get to the Raffles Hotel, and contact that agent  of Bostworth's, and get some word to him!\" Freddy Farmer said with a  bitter sigh.    \"I know,\" Dave grunted. \"But Serrangi is no dummy no matter how you  look at it. We haven't been out of his sight since we walked into  the rug shop almost three hours ago. I had hoped he was going to let  us come out here on our own. Maybe then we could have slipped by the  Raffles and gotten some word to Bostworth. Nix, though! Serrangi came  out with us in that Nineteen-Six jallopy, and showed us the path  through the brush up to the edge of the field, here. And a funny  sensation in the middle of my back tells me that he's back there a ways  _still_ keeping an eye on us. We sure picked something this time, pal.  We picked a pip, and I ain't kidding.\"    \"But if only Bostworth knew...!\" Freddy began and let the rest trail  off.    \"Knew what?\" Dave murmured. \"That's the point! What could we really  tell him that would make sense? Darn little, pal. Less than that, in  fact. Serrangi tells us that at a given signal some rat at R.A.F.  Base is going to blow lots of things sky high. He tells us that a Jap  General has a hidden field with plenty planes up near Raja, in Burma.  At the right time the Jap is going to blow the whistle, and things are  supposed to pop in lots of places. And in my pocket I've got what looks  like a pencil, only it's rolled up code data Serrangi gave us to give  to General Kashomia. There you are.\"    \"Well?\" Freddy Farmer grunted. \"Isn't that a lot?\"    \"It's nothing when you pick it apart,\" Dave said. \"Figure it out. We  don't know who the R.A.F. rat is, and Bostworth doesn't. Maybe there is  a Jap general up at Raja with flocks of planes. So what? Is Bostworth  going to send R.A.F. planes up there on our say-so to blast them out?  Declare war on Japan, just like that? Fat chance! The British don't do  things that way. Also, we don't know where the hidden field really is  until we see the flare signals the Japs are to send up. Yeah! Burmese  would get kind of sore if the British flew all over their country  dumping bombs, trying to blast somebody they _think_ is there. And  here's a point, too. We don't know the striking date. It may be right  after we get there ... and whether we get there, or not! Chances are,  by the time Bostworth could induce Far East High Command to swing into  action the Japs might be swinging their sneak haymaker. And this code  data I've got in my pocket. Think Serrangi would have trusted us with  it _if_ there was even the slimmest chance that British Intelligence  could break the code in time. Nuts! So what have we got?\"    \"You're right!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"Blasted little. Really nothing,  when you come to look at it. But I hate to think of turning over that  code data to General Kashomia! No doubt it's complete information of  our strength, and such, here in the Far East. Probably high military  secrets we've guarded for years.\"    \"At least,\" Dave grunted. \"And it puts us right behind the eight ball.  We've _got_ to turn it over to General Kashomia. Nothing happens until  we do. And _we_ can't do anything until something _does_ happen. We've  sort of got to pay out more rope, and pray we can take up the slack  fast when we have to. If you get what I mean?\"    \"Yes, but what a chance we've got to take!\" Freddy said in a voice that  trembled slightly. \"If we fail, Dave.... I mean, if things go through  as the blasted Japs seem to be planning, the blood of Singapore will be  on our hands. It will be because we failed. It...!\"    Dave stuck out an elbow and jabbed the English youth in the side.    \"Cut it!\" he hissed. \"That's not Freddy Farmer talking! Let's beat  our brains out after we've failed. And, pal, that's something you and  I just ain't going to up and do. Not while we can stand up and keep  punching. So, heave that kind of talk in the river, Mister!\"    Dave felt pressure on his arm, and heard Freddy's emotion choked voice.    \"Thanks, Dave. I'm all right, now. I wish you'd kick me, and hard.\"    \"I'll take a rain check on that invite,\" Dave said with a chuckle. \"But  forget it, Freddy. Heck! You'd up and leave me flat, if you knew some  of the thoughts that have been breezing around in _my_ head. So skip  it. I guess it's this waiting that's getting us. I wish Serrangi's boys  would hurry up and start the fireworks so's we can get started. You  know, this sort of thing is darn near getting to be a habit.\"    \"What is?\" Freddy wanted to know.    \"Posing as Axis agents, and swiping a British plane,\" Dave said.  \"Remember that time when we were on convoy patrol, and had to waltz off  with that Catalina? We were plenty lucky then, and I've got a hunch  we're going to have to be twice as lucky this time.\"[2]    [Footnote 2: _Dave Dawson On Convoy Patrol._]    \"Lucky to get off without British bullets in our backs,\" Freddy Farmer  murmured. \"And lucky if _all_ the gas tanks are filled. It will  certainly be a blasted mess if our gas gives out and we have to force  land somewhere in Thailand, or Burma.\"    Dave didn't make any reply to that for the simple reason there wasn't  anything to be said. Perhaps the most pronounced fear of all regarding  the wild, crazy venture into which they were plunging blindly was  the fear of their fuel running out on them before they had reached  the hidden airdrome in the wild Burmese mountains. If it was to be a  Wellington or Whitley bomber they were to take aloft there wouldn't be  any worry at all. But stealing a bomber was definitely out. It took  time to get those babies off the ground, and possible British fighter  planes giving chase could catch a bomber in short order. So it had to  be the fastest two seater type at the Base. And as luck would have it  they had spotted the six Bristol \"Taurus\" powered Fairey \"Albacores\"  on the tarmac but a few seconds after they had reached the place  where they now hugged the ground. They could make the distance in an  Albacore. It might be close, but everything would be in their favor.  They could get one off fast, they could gain altitude in the night sky  fast, and an Albacore had a"]]]
