[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#18)"],[1," that account alone does he make us laugh. [Footnote: When  the humorist laughs at himself, he is really acting a double part; the  self who laughs is indeed conscious, but not the self who is laughed  at.] Profoundly comic sayings are those artless ones in which some vice  reveals itself in all its nakedness: how could it thus expose itself  were it capable of seeing itself as it is? It is not uncommon for a  comic character to condemn in general terms a certain line of conduct  and immediately afterwards afford an example of it himself: for  instance, M. Jourdain's teacher of philosophy flying into a passion  after inveighing against anger; Vadius taking a poem from his pocket  after heaping ridicule on readers of poetry, etc. What is the object of  such contradictions except to help us to put our finger on the  obliviousness of the characters to their own actions? Inattention to  self, and consequently to others, is what we invariably find. And if we  look at the matter closely, we see that inattention is here equivalent  to what we have called unsociability. The chief cause of rigidity is  the neglect to look around--and more especially within oneself: how can  a man fashion his personality after that of another if he does not  first study others as well as himself? Rigidity, automatism,  absent-mindedness and unsociability are all inextricably entwined; and  all serve as ingredients to the making up of the comic in character.    In a word, if we leave on one side, when dealing with human  personality, that portion which interests our sensibility or appeals to  our feeling, all the rest is capable of becoming comic, and the comic  will be proportioned to the rigidity. We formulated this idea at the  outset of this work. We have verified it in its main results, and have  just applied it to the definition of comedy. Now we must get to closer  quarters, and show how it enables us to delimitate the exact position  comedy occupies among all the other arts. In one sense it might be said  that all character is comic, provided we mean by character the  ready-made element in our personality, that mechanical element which  resembles a piece of clockwork wound up once for all and capable of  working automatically. It is, if you will, that which causes us to  imitate ourselves. And it is also, for that very reason, that which  enables others to imitate us. Every comic character is a type.  Inversely, every resemblance to a type has something comic in it.  Though we may long have associated with an individual without  discovering anything about him to laugh at, still, if advantage is t  taken of some accidental analogy to dub him with the name of a famous  hero of romance or drama, he will in our eyes border upon the  ridiculous, if only for a moment. And yet this hero of romance may not  be a comic character at all. But then it is comic to be like him. It is  comic to wander out of one's own self. It is comic to fall into a  ready-made category. And what is most comic of all is to become a  category oneself into which others will fall, as into a ready-made  frame; it is to crystallise into a stock character.    Thus, to depict characters, that is to say, general types, is the  object of high-class comedy. This has often been said. But it is as  well to repeat it, since there could be no better definition of comedy.  Not only are we entitled to say that comedy gives us general types, but  we might add that it is the ONLY one of all the arts that aims at the  general; so that once this objective has been attributed to it, we have  said all that it is and all that the rest cannot be. To prove that such  is really the essence of comedy, and that it is in this respect opposed  to tragedy, drama and the other forms of art, we should begin by  defining art in its higher forms: then, gradually coming down to comic  poetry, we should find that this latter is situated on the border-line  between art and life, and that, by the generality of its  subject-matter, it contrasts with the rest of the arts. We cannot here  plunge into so vast a subject of investigation; but we needs must  sketch its main outlines, lest we overlook what, to our mind, is  essential on the comic stage.    What is the object of art? Could reality come into direct contact with  sense and consciousness, could we enter into immediate communion with  things and with ourselves, probably art would be useless, or rather we  should all be artists, for then our soul would continually vibrate in  perfect accord with nature. Our eyes, aided by memory, would carve out  in space and fix in time the most inimitable of pictures. Hewn in the  living marble of the human form, fragments of statues, beautiful as the  relics of antique statuary, would strike the passing glance. Deep in  our souls we should hear the strains of our inner life's unbroken  melody,--a music that is ofttimes gay, but more frequently plaintive  and always original. All this is around and within us, and yet no whit  of it do we distinctly perceive. Between nature and ourselves, nay,  between ourselves and our own consciousness a veil is interposed: a  veil that is dense and opaque for the common herd,--thin, almost  transparent, for the artist and the poet. What fairy wove that veil?  Was it done in malice or in friendliness? We had to live, and life  demands that we grasp things in their relations to our own needs. Life  is action. Life implies the acceptance only of the UTILITARIAN side of  things in order to respond to them by appropriate reactions: all other  impressions must be dimmed or else reach us vague and blurred. I look  and I think I see, I listen and I think I hear, I examine myself and I  think I am reading the very depths of my heart. But what I see and hear  of the outer world is purely and simply a selection made by my senses  to serve as a light to my conduct; what I know of myself is what comes  to the surface, what participates in my actions. My senses and my  consciousness, therefore, give me no more than a practical  simplification of reality. In the vision they furnish me of myself and  of things, the differences that are useless to man are obliterated, the  resemblances that are useful to him are emphasised; ways are traced out  for me in advance, along which my activity is to travel. These ways are  the ways which all mankind has trod before me. Things have been  classified with a view to the use I can derive from them. And it is  this classification I perceive, far more clearly than the colour and  the shape of things. Doubtless man is vastly superior to the lower  animals in this respect. It is not very likely that the eye of a wolf  makes any distinction between a kid and a lamb; both appear t o the  wolf as the same identical quarry, alike easy to pounce upon, alike  good to devour. We, for our part, make a distinction between a goat and  a sheep; but can we tell one goat from another, one sheep from another?  The INDIVIDUALITY of things or of beings escapes us, unless it is  materially to our advantage to perceive it. Even when we do take note  of it--as when we distinguish one man from another--it is not the  individuality itself that the eye grasps, i.e., an entirely original  harmony of forms and colours, but only one or two features that will  make practical recognition easier.    In short, we do not see the actual things themselves; in most cases we  confine ourselves to reading the labels affixed to them. This tendency,  the result of need, has become even more pronounced under the influence  of speech; for words--with the exception of proper nouns--all denote  genera. The word, which only takes note of the most ordinary function  and commonplace aspect of the thing, intervenes between it and  ourselves, and would conceal its form from our eyes, were that form not  already masked beneath the necessities that brought the word into  existence. Not only external objects, but even our own mental states,  are screened from us in their inmost, their personal aspect, in the  original life they possess. When we feel love or hatred, when we are  gay or sad, is it really the feeling itself that reaches our  consciousness with those innumerable fleeting shades of meaning and  deep resounding echoes that make it something altogether our own? We  should all, were it so, be novelists or poets or musicians. Mostly,  however, we perceive nothing but the outward display of our mental  state. We catch only the impersonal aspect of our feelings, that aspect  which speech has set down once for all because it is almost the same,  in the same conditions, for all men. Thus, even in our own individual,  individuality escapes our ken. We move amidst generalities and symbols,  as within a tilt-yard in which our force is effectively pitted against  other forces; and fascinated by action, tempted by it, for our own  good, on to the field it has selected, we live in a zone midway between  things and ourselves, externally to things, externally also to  ourselves. From time to time, however, in a fit of absentmindedness,  nature raises up souls that are more detached from life. Not with that  intentional, logical, systematical detachment--the result of reflection  and philosophy--but rather with natural detachment, one innate in the  structure of sense or consciousness, which at once reveals itself by a  virginal manner, so to speak, of seeing, hearing or thinking. Were this  detachment complete, did the soul no longer cleave to action by any of  its perceptions, it would be the soul of an artist such as the world  has never yet seen. It would excel alike in every art at the same time;  or rather, it would fuse them all into one. It would perceive all  things in their native purity: the forms, colours, sounds of the  physical world as well as the subtlest movements of the inner life. But  this is asking too much of nature. Even for such of us as she has made  artists, it is by accident, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#18)"],[1,"try to catch me, as you have  done,\" replied the butterfly.    \"And they mock me, and jeer at me through the window,\" continued the  mandarin, bitterly. \"Therefore, they are your enemies and mine! But  with your aid and the help of the magic book we shall have a fine  revenge for their insults.\"    \"I don't care much for revenge,\" said the butterfly. \"They are but  children, and 'tis natural they should wish to catch such a  beautiful creature as I am.\"    \"Nevertheless, I care! and you must obey me,\" retorted the mandarin,  harshly. \"I, at least, will have my revenge.\"    Then he stuck a drop of molasses upon the wall beside the  butterfly's head and said:    \"Eat that, while I read my book and prepare my magic formula.\"    So the butterfly feasted upon the molasses and the mandarin studied  his book, after which he began to mix a magic compound in the tin  cup.    When the mixture was ready he released the butterfly from the wall  and said to it:    \"I command you to dip your two front feet into this magic compound  and then fly away until you meet a child. Fly close, whether it be a  boy or a girl, and touch the child upon its forehead with your feet.  Whosoever is thus touched, the book declares, will at once become a  pig, and will remain such forever after. Then return to me and dip  you legs afresh in the contents of this cup. So shall all my  enemies, the children, become miserable swine, while no one will  think of accusing me of the sorcery.\"    \"Very well; since such is your command, I obey,\" said the butterfly.  Then it dipped its front legs, which were the shortest of the six,  into the contents of the tin cup, and flew out of the door and away  over the houses to the edge of the town. There it alighted in a  flower garden and soon forgot all about its mission to turn children  into swine.    In going from flower to flower it soon brushed the magic compound  from its legs, so that when the sun began to set and the butterfly  finally remembered its master, the mandarin, it could not have  injured a child had it tried.    But it did not intend to try.    \"That horrid old Chinaman,\" it thought, \"hates children and wishes  to destroy them. But I rather like children myself and shall not  harm them. Of course I must return to my master, for he is a  magician, and would seek me out and kill me; but I can deceive him  about this matter easily enough.\"    When the butterfly flew in at the door of the mandarin's laundry he  asked, eagerly:    \"Well, did you meet a child?\"    \"I did,\" replied the butterfly, calmly. \"It was a pretty,  golden-haired girl--but now 'tis a grunting pig!\"    \"Good! Good! Good!\" cried the mandarin, dancing joyfully about the  room. \"You shall have molasses for your supper, and to-morrow you  must change two children into pigs.\"    The butterfly did not reply, but ate the molasses in silence. Having  no soul it had no conscience, and having no conscience it was able  to lie to the mandarin with great readiness and a certain amount of  enjoyment.    Next morning, by the mandarin's command, the butterfly dipped its  legs in the mixture and flew away in search of children.    When it came to the edge of the town it noticed a pig in a sty, and  alighting upon the rail of the sty it looked down at the creature  and thought.    \"If I could change a child into a pig by touching it with the magic  compound, what could I change a pig into, I wonder?\"    Being curious to determine this fine point in sorcery the butterfly  fluttered down and touched its front feet to the pig's nose.  Instantly the animal disappeared, and in its place was a  shock-headed, dirty looking boy, which sprang from the sty and ran  down the road uttering load whoops.    \"That's funny,\" said the butterfly to itself. \"The mandarin would be  very angry with me if he knew of this, for I have liberated one more  of the creatures that bother him.\"    It fluttered along after the boy, who had paused to throw stones at  a cat. But pussy escaped by running up a tree, where thick branches  protected her from the stones. Then the boy discovered a  newly-planted garden, and trampled upon the beds until the seeds  were scattered far and wide, and the garden was ruined. Next he  caught up a switch and struck with it a young calf that stood  quietly grazing in a field. The poor creature ran away with piteous  bleats, and the boy laughed and followed after it, striking the  frightened animal again and again.    \"Really,\" thought the butterfly, \"I do not wonder the mandarin hates  children, if they are all so cruel and wicked as this one.\"    The calf having escaped him the boy came back to the road, where he  met two little girls on their way to school. One of them had a red  apple in her hand, and the boy snatched it away and began eating it.  The little girl commenced to cry, but her companion, more brave and  sturdy, cried out:    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you nasty boy!\"    At this the boy reached out and slapped her pretty face, whereupon  she also began to sob.    Although possessed of neither soul nor conscience, the butterfly had  a very tender heart, and now decided it could endure this boy no  longer.    \"If I permitted him to exist,\" it reflected, \"I should never forgive  myself, for the monster would do nothing but evil from morning 'til  night.\"    So it flew directly into his face and touched his forehead with its  sticky front feet.    The next instant the boy had disappeared, but a grunting pig ran  swiftly up the road in the direction of its sty.    The butterfly gave a sigh of relief.    \"This time I have indeed used the mandarin's magic upon a child,\" it  whispered, as it floated lazily upon the light breeze; \"but since  the child was originally a pig I do not think I have any cause to  reproach myself. The little girls were sweet and gentle, and I would  not injure them to save my life, but were all boys like this  transformed pig, I should not hesitate to carry out the mandarin's  orders.\"    Then it flew into a rose bush, where it remained comfortably until  evening. At sundown it returned to its master.    \"Have you changed two of them into pigs?\" he asked, at once.    \"I have,\" replied the butterfly. \"One was a pretty, black-eyed baby,  and the other a freckle-faced, red-haired, barefooted newboy.\"    \"Good! Good! Good!\" screamed the mandarin, in an ecstasy of delight.  \"Those are the ones who torment me the most! Change every newboy you  meet into a pig!\"    \"Very well,\" answered the butterfly, quietly, and ate its supper of  molasses.    Several days were passed by the butterfly in the same manner. It  fluttered aimlessly about the flower gardens while the sun shone,  and returned at night to the mandarin with false tales of turning  children into swine. Sometimes it would be one child which was  transformed, sometimes two, and occasionally three; but the mandarin  always greeted the butterfly's report with intense delight and gave  him molasses for supper.    One evening, however, the butterfly thought it might be well to vary  the report, so that the mandarin might not grow suspicious; and when  its master asked what child had been had been changed into a pig  that day the lying creature answered:    \"It was a Chinese boy, and when I touched him he became a black  pig.\"    This angered the mandarin, who was in an especially cross mood. He  spitefully snapped the butterfly with his finger, and nearly broke  its beautiful wing; for he forgot that Chinese boys had once mocked  him and only remembered his hatred for American boys.    The butterfly became very indignant at this abuse from the mandarin.  It refused to eat its molasses and sulked all the evening, for it  had grown to hate the mandarin almost as much as the mandarin hated  children.    When morning came it was still trembling with indignation; but the  mandarin cried out:    \"Make haste, miserable slave; for to-day you must change four  children into pigs, to make up for yesterday.\"    The butterfly did not reply. His little black eyes were sparkling  wickedly, and no sooner had he dipped his feet into the magic  compound than he flew full in the mandarin's face, and touched him  upon his ugly, flat forehead.    Soon after a gentleman came into the room for his laundry. The  mandarin was not there, but running around the place was a  repulsive, scrawny pig, which squealed most miserably.    The butterfly flew away to a brook and washed from its feet all  traces of the magic compound. When night came it slept in a rose  bush."]]]
