And when Orpheus saw it he groaned, and struck his hands together.  And  'Little will it help us,' he cried, 'to escape the jaws of the whirlpool;  for in that cave lives Scylla, the sea-hag with a young whelp's voice; my  mother warned me of her ere we sailed away from Hellas; she has six  heads, and six long necks, and hides in that dark cleft.  And from her  cave she fishes for all things which pass by--for sharks, and seals, and  dolphins, and all the herds of Amphitrite.  And never ship's crew boasted  that they came safe by her rock, for she bends her long necks down to  them, and every mouth takes up a man.  And who will help us now?  For  Hera and Zeus hate us, and our ship is foul with guilt; so we must die,  whatever befalls.'    Then out of the depths came Thetis, Peleus' silver-footed bride, for love  of her gallant husband, and all her nymphs around her; and they played  like snow-white dolphins, diving on from wave to wave, before the ship,  and in her wake, and beside her, as dolphins play.  And they caught the  ship, and guided her, and passed her on from hand to hand, and tossed her  through the billows, as maidens toss the ball.  And when Scylla stooped  to seize her, they struck back her ravening heads, and foul Scylla  whined, as a whelp whines, at the touch of their gentle hands.  But she  shrank into her cave affrighted--for all bad things shrink from good--and  _Argo_ leapt safe past her, while a fair breeze rose behind.  Then Thetis  and her nymphs sank down to their coral caves beneath the sea, and their  gardens of green and purple, where live flowers bloom all the year round;  while the heroes went on rejoicing, yet dreading what might come next.    After that they rowed on steadily for many a weary day, till they saw a  long high island, and beyond it a mountain land.  And they searched till  they found a harbour, and there rowed boldly in.  But after awhile they  stopped, and wondered, for there stood a great city on the shore, and  temples and walls and gardens, and castles high in air upon the cliffs.  And on either side they saw a harbour, with a narrow mouth, but wide  within; and black ships without number, high and dry upon the shore.    Then Ancaios, the wise helmsman, spoke, 'What new wonder is this?  I know  all isles, and harbours, and the windings of all seas; and this should be  Corcyra, where a few wild goat-herds dwell.  But whence come these new  harbours and vast works of polished stone?'    But Jason said, 'They can be no savage people.  We will go in and take  our chance.'    So they rowed into the harbour, among a thousand black-beaked ships, each  larger far than _Argo_, toward a quay of polished stone.  And they  wondered at that mighty city, with its roofs of burnished brass, and long  and lofty walls of marble, with strong palisades above.  And the quays  were full of people, merchants, and mariners, and slaves, going to and  fro with merchandise among the crowd of ships.  And the heroes' hearts  were humbled, and they looked at each other and said, 'We thought  ourselves a gallant crew when we sailed from Iolcos by the sea; but how  small we look before this city, like an ant before a hive of bees.'    Then the sailors hailed them roughly from the quay, 'What men are  you?--we want no strangers here, nor pirates.  We keep our business to  ourselves.'    But Jason answered gently, with many a flattering word, and praised their  city and their harbour, and their fleet of gallant ships.  'Surely you  are the children of Poseidon, and the masters of the sea; and we are but  poor wandering mariners, worn out with thirst and toil.  Give us but food  and water, and we will go on our voyage in peace.'    Then the sailors laughed, and answered, 'Stranger, you are no fool; you  talk like an honest man, and you shall find us honest too.  We are the  children of Poseidon, and the masters of the sea; but come ashore to us,  and you shall have the best that we can give.'    So they limped ashore, all stiff and weary, with long ragged beards and  sunburnt cheeks, and garments torn and weather-stained, and weapons  rusted with the spray, while the sailors laughed at them (for they were  rough-tongued, though their hearts were frank and kind).  And one said,  'These fellows are but raw sailors; they look as if they had been  sea-sick all the day.'  And another, 'Their legs have grown crooked with  much rowing, till they waddle in their walk like ducks.'    At that Idas the rash would have struck them; but Jason held him back,  till one of the merchant kings spoke to them, a tall and stately man.    'Do not be angry, strangers; the sailor boys must have their jest.  But  we will treat you justly and kindly, for strangers and poor men come from  God; and you seem no common sailors by your strength, and height, and  weapons.  Come up with me to the palace of Alcinous, the rich sea-going  king, and we will feast you well and heartily; and after that you shall  tell us your name.'    But Medeia hung back, and trembled, and whispered in Jason's ear, 'We are  betrayed, and are going to our ruin, for I see my countrymen among the  crowd; dark-eyed Colchi in steel mail-shirts, such as they wear in my  father's land.'    'It is too late to turn,' said Jason.  And he spoke to the merchant king,  'What country is this, good sir; and what is this new-built town?'    'This is the land of the Phaeaces, beloved by all the Immortals; for they  come hither and feast like friends with us, and sit by our side in the  hall.  Hither we came from Liburnia to escape the unrighteous Cyclopes;  for they robbed us, peaceful merchants, of our hard-earned wares and  wealth.  So Nausithous, the son of Poseidon, brought us hither, and died  in peace; and now his son Alcinous rules us, and Arete the wisest of  queens.'    So they went up across the square, and wondered still more as they went;  for along the quays lay in order great cables, and yards, and masts,  before the fair temple of Poseidon, the blue-haired king of the seas.  And round the square worked the ship-wrights, as many in number as ants,  twining ropes, and hewing timber, and smoothing long yards and oars.  And  the Minuai went on in silence through clean white marble streets, till  they came to the hall of Alcinous, and they wondered then still more.  For the lofty palace shone aloft in the sun, with walls of plated brass,  from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and the doors were of silver  and gold.  And on each side of the doorway sat living dogs of gold, who  never grew old or died, so well Hephaistos had made them in his forges in  smoking Lemnos, and gave them to Alcinous to guard his gates by night.  And within, against the walls, stood thrones on either side, down the  whole length of the hall, strewn with rich glossy shawls; and on them the  merchant kings of those crafty sea-roving Phaeaces sat eating and  drinking in pride, and feasting there all the year round.  And boys of  molten gold stood each on a polished altar, and held torches in their  hands, to give light all night to the guests.  And round the house sat  fifty maid-servants, some grinding the meal in the mill, some turning the  spindle, some weaving at the loom, while their hands twinkled as they  passed the shuttle, like quivering aspen leaves.    And outside before the palace a great garden was walled round, filled  full of stately fruit-trees, gray olives and sweet figs, and  pomegranates, pears, and apples, which bore the whole year round.  For  the rich south-west wind fed them, till pear grew ripe on pear, fig on  fig, and grape on grape, all the winter and the spring.  And at the  farther end gay flower-beds bloomed through all seasons of the year; and  two fair fountains rose, and ran, one through the garden grounds, and one  beneath the palace gate, to water all the town.  Such noble gifts the  heavens had given to Alcinous the wise.    So they went in, and saw him sitting, like Poseidon, on his throne, with  his golden sceptre by him, in garments stiff with gold, and in his hand a  sculptured goblet, as he pledged the merchant kings; and beside him stood  Arete, his wise and lovely queen, and leaned against a pillar as she spun  her golden threads.    Then Alcinous rose, and welcomed them, and bade them sit and eat; and the  servants brought them tables, and bread, and meat, and wine.    But Medeia went on trembling toward Arete the fair queen, and fell at her  knees, and clasped them, and cried, weeping, as she knelt--    'I am your guest, fair queen, and I entreat you by Zeus, from whom  prayers come.  Do not send me back to my father to die some dreadful  death; but let me go my way, and bear my burden.  Have I not had enough  of punishment and shame?'    'Who are you, strange maiden? and what is the meaning of your prayer?'    'I am Medeia, daughter of Aietes, and I saw my countrymen here to-day;  and I know that they are come to find me, and take me home to die some  dreadful death.'    Then Arete frowned, and said, 'Lead this girl in, my maidens; and let the  kings decide, not I.'    And Alcinous leapt up from his throne, and cried, 'Speak, strangers, who  are you?  And who is this maiden?'    'We are the heroes of the Minuai,' said Jason; 'and this maiden has  spoken truth.  We are the men who took the golden fleece, the men whose  fame has run round every shore.  We came hither out of the ocean, after  sorrows such as man never saw before.  We went out many, and come back  few, for many a noble comrade have we lost.  So let us go, as you should  let your guests go, in peace; that the world may say, \"Alcinous is a just  king.\"'    But Alcinous frowned, and stood deep in thought; and at last he spoke--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#18)"],[1," (aside). Hereabouts, they say, I shall find him. Ha! What  faces are these? Should they be--if these--they must be the men! Yes,  'tis they,'tis they! I will accost them.    SCHWARZ. Take heed! Who goes there?    KOSINSKY. Pardon, sirs. I know not whether I am going right or wrong.    CHARLES. Suppose right, whom do you take us to be?    KOSINSKY. Men!    SCHWEITZER. I wonder, captain, whether we have given any proof of that?    KOSINSKY. I am in search of men who can look death in the face, and let  danger play around then like a tamed snake; who prize liberty above life  or honor; whose very names, hailed by the poor and the oppressed, appal  the boldest, and make tyrants tremble.    SCHWEITZER (to the Captain). I like that fellow. Hark ye, friend! You  have found your men.    KOSINSKY. So I should think, and I hope soon to find them brothers.  You can direct me to the man I am looking for. 'Tis your captain, the  great Count von Moor.    SCHWEITZER (taking him warmly by the hand). There's a good lad. You  and I must be chums.    CHARLES (coming nearer). Do you know the captain?    KOSINSKY. Thou art he!--in those features--that air--who can look at  thee, and doubt it? (Looks earnestly at him for some time). I have  always wished to see the man with the annihilating look, as he sat on  the ruins of Carthage.* That wish is realized.       *[Alluding to Caius Marius. See Plutarch's Lives.]    SCHWEITZER. A mettlesome fellow!--    CHARLES. And what brings you to me?    KOSINSKY. Oh, captain! my more than cruel fate. I have suffered  shipwrecked on the stormy ocean of the world; I have seen all my fondest  hopes perish; and nought remains to me but a remembrance of the bitter  past, which would drive me to madness, were I not to drown it by  directing my energies to new objects.    CHARLES. Another arraignment of the ways of Providence! Proceed.    KOSINSKY. I became a soldier. Misfortune still followed me in the  army. I made a venture to the Indies, and my ship was shivered on the  rocks--nothing but frustrated hopes! At last, I heard tell far and wide  of your valiant deeds, incendiarisms, as they called them, and I came  straightway hither, a distance of thirty leagues, firmly resolved to  serve under you, if you will deign to accept my services. I entreat  thee, noble captain, refuse me not!    SCHWEITZER (with a leap into the air). Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Roller  replaced ten hundred-fold! An out-and-out brother cut-throat for our  troop.    CHARLES. What is your name?    KOSINSKY. Kosinsky.    CHARLES. What? Kosinsky! And do you know that you are but a  thoughtless boy, and are embarking on the most weighty passage of your  life as heedlessly as a giddy girl? You will find no playing at bowls  or ninepins here, as you probably imagine.    KOSINSKY. I understand you, sir. I am,'tis true, but four-and-twenty  years old, but I have seen swords glittering, and have heard balls  whistling around me.    CHARLES. Indeed, young gentleman? And was it for this that you took  fencing lessons, to run poor travellers through the body for the sake of  a dollar, or stab women in the back? Go! go! You have played truant to  your nurse because she shook the rod at you.    SCHWEITZER. Why, what the devil, captain! what are you about? Do you  mean to turn away such a Hercules? Does he not look as if he could  baste Marechal Saxe across the Ganges with a ladle?    CHARLES. Because your silly schemes miscarry, you come here to turn  rogue and assassin! Murder, boy, do you know the meaning of that word?  You may have slumbered in peace after cropping a few poppy-heads, but to  have a murder on your soul--    KOSINSKY. All the murders you bid me commit be upon my head!    CHARLES. What! Are you so nimble-witted? Do you take measure of a man  to catch him by flattery? How do you know that I am not haunted by  terrific dreams, or that I shall not tremble on my death-bed?--How much  have you already done of which you have considered the responsibility?    KOSINSKY. Very little, I must confess; excepting this long journey to  you, noble count--    CHARLES. Has your tutor let the story of Robin Hood--get into your  hands? Such careless rascals ought to be sent to the galleys. And has  it heated your childish fancy, and infected you with the mania of  becoming a hero? Are you thirsting for honor and fame? Would you buy  immortality by deeds of incendiarism? Mark me, ambitious youth! No  laurel blooms for the incendiary. No triumph awaits the victories of  the bandit--nothing but curses, danger, death, disgrace. Do you see the  gibbet yonder on the hill?    SPIEGEL (going up and down indignantly). Oh, how stupid! How  abominably, unpardonably stupid! That's not the way. I went to work  in a very different manner.    KOSINSKY. What should he fear, who fears not death?    CHARLES. Bravo! Capital! You have made good use of your time at  school; you have got your Seneca cleverly by heart. But, my good  friend, you will not be able with these fine phrases to cajole nature  in the hour of suffering; they will never blunt the biting tooth of  remorse. Ponder on it well, my son! (Takes him by the hand.) I advise  you as a father. First learn the depth of the abyss before you plunge  headlong into it. If in this world you can catch a single glimpse of  happiness--moments may come when you-awake,--and then--it may be too  late. Here you step out as it were beyond the pale of humanity--you  must either be more than human or a demon. Once more, my son! if but  a single spark of hope glimmer for you elsewhere, fly this fearful  compact, where nought but despair enters, unless a higher wisdom has so  ordained it. You may deceive yourself--believe me, it is possible to  mistake that for strength of mind which in reality is nothing more than  despair. Take my counsel! mine! and depart quickly.    KOSINSKY. No! I will not stir. If my entreaties fail to move you, hear  but the story of my misfortunes. And then you will force the dagger  into my hand as eagerly as you now seek to withhold it. Seat yourselves  awhile on the grass and listen.    CHARLES. I will hear your story.    KOSINSKY. Know, then, that I am a Bohemian nobleman. By the early  death of my father I became master of large possessions. The scene of  my domain was a paradise; for it contained an angel--a maid adorned with  all the charms of blooming youth, and chaste as the light of heaven.  But to whom do I talk of this? It falls unheeded on your cars--ye never  loved, ye were never beloved--    SCHWEITZER. Gently, gently! The captain grows red as fire.    CHARLES. No more! I'll hear you some other time--to-morrow,--or  by-and-by, or--after I have seen blood.    KOSINSKY. Blood, blood! Only hear on! Blood will fill your whole  soul. She was of citizen birth, a German--but her look dissolved all  the prejudices of aristocracy. With blushing modesty she received the  bridal ring from my hand, and on the morrow I was to have led my AMELIA  to the altar. (CHARLES rises suddenly.) In the midst of my intoxicating  dream of happiness, and while our nuptials were preparing, an express  summoned me to court. I obeyed the summons. Letters were shown me  which I was said to have written, full of treasonable matter. I grew  scarlet with indignation at such malice; they deprived me of my sword,  thrust me into prison, and all my senses forsook me.    SCHWEITZER. And in the meantime--go on! I already scent the game.    KOSINSKY. There I lay a whole month, and knew not what was taking  place. I was full of anxiety for my Amelia, who I was sure would suffer  the pangs of death every moment in apprehension of my fate. At last the  prime minister makes his appearance,--congratulates me in honey-sweet  words on the establishment of my innocence,--reads to me a warrant of  discharge,--and returns me my sword. I flew in triumph to my castle, to  the arms of my Amelia, but she had disappeared! She had been carried  off, it was said, at midnight, no one knew whither, and no eye had  beheld her since. A suspicion instantly flashed across my mind. I  rushed to the capital--I made inquiries at court--all eyes were upon  me,--no one would give me information. At last I discovered her through  a grated window of the palace--she threw me a small billet.    SCHWEITZER. Did I not say so?    KOSINSKY. Death and destruction! The contents were these! They had  given her the choice between seeing me put to death, and becoming the  mistress of the prince. In the struggle between honor and love she  chose the latter, and (with a bitter smile) I was saved.    SCHWEITZER. And what did you do then?    KOSINSKY. Then I stood like one transfixed with a thunderbolt! Blood  was my first thought, blood my last! Foaming at the mouth, I ran to my  quarters, armed myself with a two-edged sword, and, with all haste,  rushed to the minister's house, for he--he alone--had been the fiendish  pander. They must have observed me in the street, for, as I went up, I  found all the doors fastened. I searched, I enquired. He was gone,  they said, to the prince. I went straight thither, but nobody there  would know anything about him. I return, force the doors, find the base  wretch, and was on the point when five or six servants suddenly rushed  on me from behind, and wrenched the weapon from my hands.    SCHWEITZER (stamping the ground). And so the fellow got off clear, and  you lost your labor?    KOSINSKY. I was arrested, accused, criminally prosecuted, degraded,  and--mark this--transported beyond the frontier, as a special favor. My  estates were confiscated to the minister, and Amelia remained in the  clutches of the tiger, where she weeps and mourns away her life, while  my vengeance must keep a fast, and crouch submissively to the yoke of  despotism.    SCHWEITZER (rising and whetting his sword). That is grist to our mill,  captain! There is something here for the incendiaries!    CHARLES (who has been walking up and down in violent"]]]
