He writ  an excellent Latyne Satyre since published; by which he excuseth and  expoundeth the precipitation of our acquaintance, so suddenly come  to her perfection; Sithence it must continue so short a time, and  begun so late (for we were both growne men, and he some yeares older  than my selfe) there was no time to be lost. And it was not to bee  modelled or directed by the paterne of regular and remisse  [Footnote: Slight, languid.] friendship, wherein so many precautions  of a long and preallable conversation [Footnote: Preceding  intercourse.] are required. This hath no other Idea than of it  selfe, and can have no reference but to itselfe. It is not one  especiall consideration, nor two, nor three, nor foure, nor a  thousand: It is I wot not what kinde of quintessence, of all this  commixture, which having seized all my will, induced the same to  plunge and lose it selfe in his, which likewise having seized all  his will, brought it to lose and plunge it selfe in mine, with a  mutuall greedinesse, and with a semblable concurrance. I may truly  say, lose, reserving nothing unto us, that might properly be called  our owne, nor that was either his or mine. When Lelius in the  presence of the Romane Consuls, who after the condemnation of  Tiberius Gracchus, pursued all those that had beene of his  acquaintance, came to enquire of Caius Blosius (who was one of his  chiefest friends) what he would have done for him, and that he  answered, \"All things.\" \"What, all things?\" replied he. \"And what if  he had willed thee to burne our Temples?\" Blosius answered, \"He  would never have commanded such a thing.\" \"But what if he had done  it?\" replied Lelius. The other answered, \"I would have obeyed him.\"  If hee were so perfect a friend to Gracchus as Histories report, he  needed not offend the Consuls with this last and bold confession,  and should not have departed from the assurance hee had of Gracchus  his minde. But yet those who accuse this answer as seditious,  understand not well this mysterie: and doe not presuppose in what  termes he stood, and that he held Gracchus his will in his sleeve,  both by power and knowledge. They were rather friends than Citizens,  rather friends than enemies of their countrey, or friends of  ambition and trouble. Having absolutely committed themselves one to  another, they perfectly held the reines of one anothers inclination:  and let this yoke be guided by vertue and conduct of reason (because  without them it is altogether impossible to combine and proportion  the same). The answer of Blosius was such as it should be. If their  affections miscarried, according to my meaning, they were neither  friends one to other, nor friends to themselves. As for the rest,  this answer sounds no more than mine would doe, to him that would in  such sort enquire of me; if your will should command you to kill  your daughter, would you doe it? and that I should consent unto it:  for, that beareth no witnesse of consent to doe it: because I am not  in doubt of my will, and as little of such a friends will. It is not  in the power of the worlds discourse to remove me from the  certaintie I have of his intentions and judgments of mine: no one of  its actions might be presented unto me, under what shape soever, but  I would presently finde the spring and motion of it. Our mindes have  jumped [Footnote: Agreed.] so unitedly together, they have with so  fervent an affection considered of each other, and with like  affection so discovered and sounded, even to the very bottome of  each others heart and entrails, that I did not only know his, as  well as mine owne, but I would (verily) rather have trusted him  concerning any matter of mine, than my selfe. Let no man compare any  of the other common friendships to this. I have as much knowledge of  them as another, yea of the perfectest of their kinde: yet wil I not  perswade any man to confound their rules, for so a man might be  deceived. In these other strict friendships a man must march with  the bridle of wisdome and precaution in his hand: the bond is not so  strictly tied but a man may in some sort distrust the same. Love him  (said Chilon) as if you should one day hate him againe. Hate him as  if you should love him againe. This precept, so abhominable in this  soveraigne and mistris Amitie, is necessarie and wholesome in the  use of vulgar and customarie friendships: toward which a man must  employ the saying Aristotle was wont so often repeat, \"Oh you my  friends, there is no perfect friend.\"    In this noble commerce, offices and benefits (nurses of other  amities) deserve not so much as to bee accounted of: this confusion  so full of our wills is cause of it: for even as the friendship I  beare unto my selfe, admits no accrease, [Footnote: Increase.] by  any succour I give my selfe in any time of need, whatsoever the  Stoickes allege; and as I acknowledge no thanks unto my selfe for  any service I doe unto myselfe, so the union of such friends, being  truly perfect, makes them lose the feeling of such duties, and hate,  and expell from one another these words of division, and difference:  benefit, good deed, dutie, obligation, acknowledgement, prayer,  thanks, and such their like. All things being by effect common  betweene them; wils, thoughts, judgements, goods, wives, children,  honour, and life; and their mutual agreement, being no other than  one soule in two bodies, according to the fit definition of  Aristotle, they can neither lend or give ought to each other. See  here the reason why Lawmakers, to honour marriage with some  imaginary resemblance of this divine bond, inhibite donations  between husband and wife; meaning thereby to inferre, that all  things should peculiarly bee proper to each of them, and that they  have nothing to divide and share together. If in the friendship  whereof I speake, one might give unto another, the receiver of the  benefit should binde his fellow. For, each seeking more than any  other thing to doe each other good, he who yeelds both matter and  occasion, is the man sheweth himselfe liberall, giving his friend  that contentment, to effect towards him what he desireth most. When  the Philosopher Diogenes wanted money, he was wont to say that he  redemanded the same of his friends, and not that he demanded it: And  to show how that is practised by effect, I will relate an ancient  singular example. Eudamidas the Corinthiam had two friends:  Charixenus a Sycionian, and Aretheus a Corinthian; being upon his  death-bed, and very poore, and his two friends very rich, thus made  his last will and testament: \"To Aretheus, I bequeath the keeping of  my mother, and to maintaine her when she shall be old: To Charixenus  the marrying of my daughter, and to give her as great a dowry as he  may: and in case one of them shall chance to die before, I appoint  the survivor to substitute his charge, and supply his place.\" Those  that first saw this testament laughed and mocked at the same; but  his heires being advertised thereof, were very well pleased, and  received it with singular contentment. And Charixenus, one of them,  dying five daies after Eudamidas, the substitution being declared in  favour of Aretheus, he carefully and very kindly kept and maintained  his mother, and of five talents that he was worth he gave two and a  halfe in marriage to one only daughter he had, and the other two and  a halfe to the daughter of Eudamidas, whom he married both in one  day. This example is very ample, if one thing were not, which is the  multitude of friends: For, this perfect amity I speake of, is  indivisible; each man doth so wholly give himselfe unto his friend,  that he hath nothing left him to divide else-where: moreover he is  grieved that he is not double, triple, or quadruple, and hath not  many soules, or sundry wils, that he might conferre them all upon  this subject. Common friendships may bee divided; a man may love  beauty in one, facility of behaviour in another, liberality in one,  and wisdome in another, paternity in this, fraternity in that man,  and so forth: but this amitie which possesseth the soule, and swaies  it in all sovereigntie, it is impossible it should be double. If two  at one instant should require helpe, to which would you run? Should  they crave contrary offices of you, what order would you follow?  Should one commit a matter to your silence, which if the other knew  would greatly profit him, what course would you take? Or how would  you discharge your selfe? A singular and principall friendship  dissolveth all other duties, and freeth all other obligations. The  secret I have sworne not to reveale to another, I may without  perjurie impart it unto him, who is no other but my selfe. It is a  great and strange wonder for a man to double himselfe; and those  that talke of tripling know not, nor cannot reach into the height of  it. \"Nothing is extreme that hath his like.\" And he who shal  presuppose that of two I love the one as wel as the other, and that  they enter-love [Footnote: Love mutually.] one another, and love me  as much as I love them: he multiplied! in brotherhood, a thing most  singular, and a lonely one, and than which one alone is also the  rarest to be found in the world. The remainder of this history  agreeth very wel with what I said; for, Eudamidas giveth us a grace  and favor to his friends to employ them in his need: he leaveth them  as his heires of his liberality, which consisteth in putting the  meanes into their hands to doe him good. And doubtlesse the force of  friendship is much more richly shewen in his deed than in Aretheus.  To conclude, they are imaginable effects to him that hath not tasted  them; and which makes me wonderfully to honor the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#18)"],[1,"ody, renewed annually,  called the Nomothetae, whose duty it also was to revise the whole of  the laws, and keep them consistent with one another. In the English  Constitution there is great difficulty in introducing any arrangement  which is new both in form and in substance, but comparatively little  repugnance is felt to the attainment of new purposes by an adaptation  of existing forms and traditions. It appears to me that the means  might be devised of enriching the Constitution with this great  improvement through the machinery of the House of Lords. A commission  for preparing bills would in itself be no more an innovation on the  Constitution than the Board for the administration of the Poor Laws,  or the Inclosure Commission. If, in consideration of the great  importance and dignity of the trust, it were made a rule that every  person appointed a member of the Legislative Commission, unless  removed from office on an address from Parliament, should be a peer  for life, it is probable that the same good sense and taste which  leave the judicial functions of the peerage practically to the  exclusive care of the law lords would leave the business of  legislation, except on questions involving political principles and  interests, to the professional legislators; that bills originating in  the Upper House would always be drawn up by them; that the government  would devolve on them the framing of all its bills; and that private  members of the House of Commons would gradually find it convenient,  and likely to facilitate the passing of their measures through the two  houses, if, instead of bringing in a bill and submitting it directly  to the house, they obtained leave to introduce it and have it referred  to the Legislative Commission; for it would, of course, be open to the  House to refer for the consideration of that body not a subject  merely, but any specific proposal, or a Draft of a Bill _in extenso_,  when any member thought himself capable of preparing one such as ought  to pass; and the House would doubtless refer every such draft to the  commission, if only as materials, and for the benefit of the  suggestions it might contain, as they would, in like manner, refer  every amendment or objection which might be proposed in writing by any  member of the House after a measure had left the commissioners' hands.  The alteration of bills by a committee of the whole House would cease,  not by formal abolition, but by desuetude; the right not being  abandoned, but laid up in the same armoury with the royal veto, the  right of withholding the supplies, and other ancient instruments of  political warfare, which no one desires to see used, but no one likes  to part with, lest they should any time be found to be still needed in  an extraordinary emergency. By such arrangements as these, legislation  would assume its proper place as a work of skilled labor and special  study and experience; while the most important liberty of the nation,  that of being governed only by laws assented to by its elected  representatives, would be fully preserved, and made more valuable by  being detached from the serious, but by no means unavoidable drawbacks  which now accompany it in the form of ignorant and ill-considered  legislation.    Instead of the function of governing, for which it is radically unfit,  the proper office of a representative assembly is to watch and control  the government; to throw the light of publicity on its acts; to compel  a full exposition and justification of all of them which any one  considers questionable; to cinsure them if found condemnable, and, if  the men who compose the government abuse their trust, or fulfill it in  a manner which conflicts with the deliberate sense of the nation, to  expel them from office, and either expressly or virtually appoint  their successors. This is surely ample power, and security enough for  the liberty of the nation. In addition to this, the Parliament has an  office not inferior even to this in importance; to be at once the  nation's Committee of Grievances and its Congress of Opinions; an  arena in which not only the general opinion of the nation, but that of  every section of it, and, as far as possible, of every eminent  individual whom it contains, can produce itself in full light and  challenge discussion; where every person in the country may count upon  finding somebody who speaks his mind as well or better than he could  speak it himself--not to friends and partisans exclusively, but in the  face of opponents, to be tested by adverse controversy; where those  whose opinion is overruled, feel satisfied that it is heard, and set  aside not by a mere act of will, but for what are thought superior  reasons, and commend themselves as such to the representatives of the  majority of the nation; where every party or opinion in the country  can muster its strength, and be cured of any illusion concerning the  number or power of its adherents; where the opinion which prevails in  the nation makes itself manifest as prevailing, and marshals its hosts  in the presence of the government, which is thus enabled and compelled  to give way to it on the mere manifestation, without the actual  employment of its strength; where statesmen can assure themselves, far  more certainly than by any other signs, what elements of opinion and  power are growing and what declining, and are enabled to shape their  measures with some regard not solely to present exigencies, but to  tendencies in progress. Representative assemblies are often taunted by  their enemies with being places of mere talk and _bavardage_. There  has seldom been more misplaced derision. I know not how a  representative assembly can more usefully employ itself than in talk,  when the subject of talk is the great public interests of the country,  and every sentence of it represents the opinion either of some  important body of persons in the nation, or of an individual in whom  some such body have reposed their confidence. A place where every  interest and shade of opinion in the country can have its cause even  passionately pleaded, in the face of the government and of all other  interests and opinions, can compel them to listen, and either comply,  or state clearly why they do not, is in itself, if it answered no  other purpose, one of the most important political institutions that  can exist any where, and one of the foremost benefits of free  government. Such \"talking\" would never be looked upon with  disparagement if it were not allowed to stop \"doing\"; which it never  would, if assemblies knew and acknowledged that talking and discussion  are their proper business, while _doing_, as the result of discussion,  is the task not of a miscellaneous body, but of individuals specially  trained to it; that the fit office of an assembly is to see that those  individuals are honestly and intelligently chosen, and to interfere no  further with them, except by unlimited latitude of suggestion and  criticism, and by applying or withholding the final seal of national  assent. It is for want of this judicious reserve that popular  assemblies attempt to do what they can not do well--to govern and  legislate--and provide no machinery but their own for much of it, when  of course every hour spent in talk is an hour withdrawn from actual  business. But the very fact which most unfits such bodies for a  council of legislation, qualifies them the more for their other  office--namely, that they are not a selection of the greatest  political minds in the country, from whose opinions little could with  certainty be inferred concerning those of the nation, but are, when  properly constituted, a fair sample of every grade of intellect among  the people which is at all entitled to a voice in public affairs.  Their part is to indicate wants, to be an organ for popular demands,  and a place of adverse discussion for all opinions relating to public  matters, both great and small; and, along with this, to check by  criticism, and eventually by withdrawing their support, those high  public officers who really conduct the public business, or who appoint  those by whom it is conducted. Nothing but the restriction of the  function of representative bodies within these rational limits will  enable the benefits of popular control to be enjoyed in conjunction  with the no less important requisites (growing ever more important as  human affairs increase in scale and in complexity) of skilled  legislation and administration. There are no means of combining these  benefits except by separating the functions which guaranty the one  from those which essentially require the other; by disjoining the  office of control and criticism from the actual conduct of affairs,  and devolving the former on the representatives of the Many, while  securing for the latter, under strict responsibility to the nation,  the acquired knowledge and practiced intelligence of a specially  trained and experienced Few.    The preceding discussion of the functions which ought to devolve on  the sovereign representative assembly of the nation would require to  be followed by an inquiry into those properly vested in the minor  representative bodies, which ought to exist for purposes that regard  only localities. And such an inquiry forms an essential part of the  present treatise; but many reasons require its postponement, until we  have considered the most proper composition of the great  representative body, destined to control as sovereign the enactment of  laws and the administration of the general affairs of the nation.
