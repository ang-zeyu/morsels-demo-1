The kitchens are very large and numerous, they  contain many cauldrons of copper, and several officials who cook the  food of the elephants and horses; which, it must be said, is rice,  chick-peas, and other vegetables. In all this there is much order  and arrangement, and if the knight to whom the king has given a  horse cares for it and treats it well, they take away that one and  give him another and a better one; and if he is negligent, they take  his away and give him another that is worse. And thus all the king's  horses and elephants are well fed and cared for, at his cost: and  the grandees, to whom he gives a great quantity of them, act in the  same manner with their knights. These horses live but a short time;  they are not bred in this country, for all of them are brought there  from the kingdom of Ormuz and that of Cambay, and on that account,  and for the great need of them, they are worth so much money. This  king has more than a hundred thousand men, both horse and foot, to  whom he gives pay: and fully five or six thousand women, to whom  also he gives pay. And wherever there is war, according to the  number of men-at-arms whom he sends there, he likewise sends with  them a quantity of women; because they say that it is not possible  to bring together an army, nor carry on war well, without women.  These women are like enchantresses, and are great dancers; they play  and sing, and pirouette. And whenever the king's officers take and  enrol any man, they strip him and look what marks he has got on his  body, and measure what his stature is, and set it all down in  writing, and from whence he comes, and the names of his father and  mother: and so he remains enrolled with all these particulars in the  pay books. And after being enrolled, it is with difficulty that he  can again obtain permission to go to his country; and if he flies  and is taken, he runs great danger, and is very ill treated. Among  these men-at-arms there are many knights, who arrive there from many  parts to take service, and these do not cease to live in their  creeds. In this kingdom there are three sects of Gentiles, and each  one of them is distinguished from the others, and their customs are  different. In the first place, the king and the grandees, and lords  and chief people of the men-at-arms, can marry more than one wife,  especially the grandees, who can maintain them: their children are  their heirs. The wives are bound to burn themselves and to die with  their husbands when they decease, because when the people die, their  bodies are burned, both of men and women. And the wives burn  themselves alive with them to honour them, in this manner: that is  to say, if she is a poor woman of little rank, when the body of the  husband is borne out to be burned in an open space outside the city,  where there is a great fire, and whilst the body of the husband is  being consumed, the wife casts herself, of her own will, into the  fire, and burns there with him. And if she is some honourable woman,  and of much property, and whether she be a young woman of beautiful  presence, or old, when her husband dies, the relations all go to the  before mentioned open space, and make a wide grave as deep as a  man's height, and fill it with sandal and other wood, and place the  dead body within and burn it; and his wife, or wives, weep for him,  and then, should she desire to honour her husband, she asks for a  term of a certain number of days to go and be burnt with him. And  they bid all her relations, and those of her husband, come and do  her honour, and give her a festal reception. And in this manner all  collect together, and entertain and pay court to her, and she spends  what she possesses among her relations and friends, in feasting and  singing, in dances and playing on musical instruments, and  amusements of jugglers. And when the term fixed has ended, she  dresses herself in her richest stuffs, and adorns herself with many  precious jewels, and the rest of her property she divides amongst  her children, relations, and friends, and then mounts a horse, with  a great sound of music, and a large following. The horse must be  grey, or very white if possible, for her to be seen better. And so  they conduct her through the whole city; paying court to her as far  as the place where the body of her husband was burned; and in the  same grave they place much wood, with which they light a very great  fire, and all round it they make a gallery with three or four steps,  whither she ascends with all her jewels and robes; and when she is  upon the top she takes three turns round it, and raises her hands to  heaven, and worships towards the east three times. And having ended  this, she calls her relations and friends, and to each she gives a  jewel of those which she wears: and all this with a very cheerful  demeanour, not as though she were about to die. And after she has  given them away, and there only remains a small cloth with which she  is covered from the waist downwards, she says to the men, \"See,  gentlemen, how much you owe to your wives, who, whilst enjoying  their freedom, burn themselves alive with their husbands.\" And to  the women she says, \"See, ladies, how much you owe to your husbands,  for in this manner you ought to accompany them even in death.\" And  when she has concluded uttering these words, they give her a pitcher  full of oil, and she places it on her head and says her prayer, and  takes three more turns and worships to the east, and casts the  pitcher of oil into the pit where the fire is: and she springs into  it, after the pitcher, with as much good will as though she were  jumping into a pool of water. And the relations have ready for this  occasion many pitchers and pots full of oil and butter, and dry  wood, which they immediately throw in, so that so great a flame is  at once kindled, that she is suddenly reduced to ashes. And  afterwards they collect these ashes, and cast them into flowing  rivers. All perform this in general, and if any women do not choose  to do this, their relations take them, shave their heads, and turn  them out of their houses and families with disgrace. And so they  wander through the world as lost ones. And those of this sort to  whom they may wish to show favour, are sent to the houses of prayer  of the idols, to serve and gain for that temple with their bodies,  if they are young women. And of these houses there are many, which  contain fifty or a hundred women of this sort; and others, who of  their own accord, being unmarried, place themselves there.[181]  These have to play and sing, for certain hours of the day, before  their idols, and the rest of the time they work for themselves.    So also when the king dies, four or five hundred women burn  themselves with him in the same manner, and they throw themselves  suddenly into the pit and fire where they burn the body of the king:  for the pit and fire are very large, and a great quantity can be  burned in it, with great abundance of wood, sandal, brasil, eagle  wood, aloes wood, and much oil of sesame and butter to make the wood  burn well. So great is the haste of those who wish to burn  themselves first, that it is something wonderful, and many men,  confidants of the king, burn themselves with him. These people eat  meat, fish, and all other viands, only cow is forbidden them by  their creed. There is another sect of Gentiles who are called  Bramans, who are priests and directors of the houses of prayer.  These do not eat meat or fish, they marry only one wife, and if she  dies they do not marry again: their children inherit their property.  They wear over the shoulder three threads as a sign of being  Bramans. These do not die for any cause, or crime which they may  commit; they are very free and easy, and are very much venerated  amongst the people. They enjoy amongst them large alms from the  kings, lords, and honourable people, with which they maintain  themselves; and many of them are rich, and others live in the houses  of prayer which there are about the country, after the manner of  monasteries. These temples also have great revenues. These people  are great eaters, and do no work except in order to eat: and they at  any time go eight leagues to satisfy themselves with food, which  they can eat on the road. Their food is rice, butter, sugar,  vegetables, and milk. In this country there is another sect of  people, who are like Bramans: they wear round their necks hung with  silk cords and wrapped in coloured cloth, a stone of the size of an  egg, and they say that it is their god. These people are much  venerated and honoured in this country; they do them no harm for any  offence which they may commit, out of reverence for that stone,  which they call tabaryne.[182] Neither do these people eat flesh nor  fish; they go safely in all countries, and they transport from one  kingdom to another much merchandise and money of the merchants, on  account of their greater security from thieves. And there are some  of them who deal in merchandise with their tani bar ine round their  necks. These likewise marry only one woman, and if they die before  their wives, they bury these alive in this manner.[183] It must be  said, that they make a grave for her a little deeper than she is  tall, and put her in it standing, and while she is quite alive they  throw in earth all around her, and press it down with their feet  until she is walled in with earth much pressed down, which reaches  to her neck, and then they put some large stones above her, and  leave her there alive covered with earth until she dies;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#18)"],[1,"   \"Then I hope it will be on one of those days that you play father.\"    \"I hope so, too,\" I said.    \"You hope so?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But don't you want to win?\"    \"I should prefer to please you.\"    \"Really, how very unselfish of you, Mr. Garnet,\" she replied, with a  laugh. \"I had no idea that such chivalry existed. I thought a golfer  would sacrifice anything to win a game.\"    \"Most things.\"    \"And trample on the feelings of anybody.\"    \"Not everybody,\" I said.    At this point the professor joined us.        CHAPTER XV    THE ARRIVAL OF NEMESIS    Some people do not believe in presentiments. They attribute that  curious feeling that something unpleasant is going to happen to such  mundane causes as liver, or a chill, or the weather. For my own part, I  think there is more in the matter than the casual observer might  imagine.    I awoke three days after my meeting with the professor at the  club-house, filled with a dull foreboding. Somehow I seemed to know  that that day was going to turn out badly for me. It may have been  liver or a chill, but it was certainly not the weather. The morning was  perfect,--the most glorious of a glorious summer. There was a haze over  the valley and out to sea which suggested a warm noon, when the sun  should have begun the serious duties of the day. The birds were singing  in the trees and breakfasting on the lawn, while Edwin, seated on one  of the flower-beds, watched them with the eye of a connoisseur.  Occasionally, when a sparrow hopped in his direction, he would make a  sudden spring, and the bird would fly away to the other side of the  lawn. I had never seen Edwin catch a sparrow. I believe they looked on  him as a bit of a crank, and humoured him by coming within springing  distance, just to keep him amused. Dashing young cock-sparrows would  show off before their particular hen-sparrows, and earn a cheap  reputation for dare-devilry by going within so many years of Edwin's  lair, and then darting away. Bob was in his favourite place on the  gravel. I took him with me down to the Cob to watch me bathe.    \"What's the matter with me to-day, Robert, old son?\" I asked him, as I  dried myself.    He blinked lazily, but contributed no suggestion.    \"It's no good looking bored,\" I went on, \"because I'm going to talk  about myself, however much it bores you. Here am I, as fit as a  prize-fighter, living in the open air for I don't know how long, eating  good plain food--bathing every morning--sea-bathing, mind you--and yet  what's the result? I feel beastly.\"    Bob yawned, and gave a little whine.    \"Yes,\" I said, \"I know I'm in love. But that can't be it, because I was  in love just as much a week ago, and I felt all right then. But isn't  she an angel, Bob? Eh? Isn't she? And didn't you feel bucked when she  patted you? Of course you did. Anybody would. But how about Tom Chase?  Don't you think he's a dangerous man? He calls her by her Christian  name, you know, and behaves generally as if she belonged to him. And  then he sees her every day, while I have to trust to meeting her at odd  times, and then I generally feel such a fool I can't think of anything  to talk about except golf and the weather. He probably sings duets with  her after dinner, and you know what comes of duets after dinner.\"    Here Bob, who had been trying for some time to find a decent excuse for  getting away, pretended to see something of importance at the other end  of the Cob, and trotted off to investigate it, leaving me to finish  dressing by myself.    \"Of course,\" I said to myself, \"It may be merely hunger. I may be all  right after breakfast. But at present I seem to be working up for a  really fine fit of the blues. I feel bad.\"    I whistled to Bob, and started for home. On the beach I saw the  professor some little distance away, and waved my towel in a friendly  manner. He made no reply.    Of course, it was possible that he had not seen me; but for some reason  his attitude struck me as ominous. As far as I could see, he was  looking straight at me, and he was not a short-sighted man. I could  think of no reason why he should cut me. We had met on the links on the  previous morning, and he had been friendliness itself. He had called me  \"me dear boy,\" supplied me with a gin and gingerbeer at the clubhouse,  and generally behaved as if he had been David and I Jonathan. Yet in  certain moods we are inclined to make mountains out of molehills, and I  went on my way, puzzled and uneasy, with a distinct impression that I  had received the cut direct.    I felt hurt. What had I done that Providence should make things so  unpleasant for me? It would be a little hard, as Ukridge would have  said, if, after all my trouble, the professor had discovered some fresh  grievance against me. Perhaps Ukridge had been irritating him again. I  wished he would not identify me so completely with Ukridge. I could not  be expected to control the man. Then I reflected that they could hardly  have met in the few hours between my parting from the professor at the  club-house and my meeting with him on the beach. Ukridge rarely left  the farm. When he was not working among the fowls, he was lying on his  back in the paddock, resting his massive mind.    I came to the conclusion that after all the professor had not seen me.    \"I'm an idiot, Bob,\" I said, as we turned in at the farm gate, \"and I  let my imagination run away with me.\"    Bob wagged his tail in approval of the sentiment.    Breakfast was ready when I got in. There was a cold chicken on the  sideboard, devilled chicken on the table, a trio of boiled eggs, and a  dish of scrambled eggs. As regarded quantity Mrs. Beale never failed us.    Ukridge was sorting the letters.    \"Morning, Garny,\" he said. \"One for you, Millie.\"    \"It's from Aunt Elizabeth,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, looking at the envelope.    I had only heard casual mention of this relative hitherto, but I had  built up a mental picture of her partly from remarks which Ukridge had  let fall, but principally from the fact that he had named the most  malignant hen in our fowl-run after her. A severe lady, I imagined with  a cold eye.    \"Wish she'd enclose a cheque,\" said Ukridge. \"She could spare it.  You've no idea, Garny, old man, how disgustingly and indecently rich  that woman is. She lives in Kensington on an income which would do her  well in Park Lane. But as a touching proposition she had proved almost  negligible. She steadfastly refuses to part.\"    \"I think she would, dear, if she knew how much we needed it. But I  don't like to ask her. She's so curious, and says such horrid things.\"    \"She does,\" agreed Ukridge, gloomily. He spoke as one who had had  experience. \"Two for you, Garny. All the rest for me. Ten of them, and  all bills.\"    He spread the envelopes out on the table, and drew one at a venture.    \"Whiteley's,\" he said. \"Getting jumpy. Are in receipt of my favour of  the 7th inst. and are at a loss to understand. It's rummy about these  blighters, but they never seem able to understand a damn thing. It's  hard! You put things in words of one syllable for them, and they just  goggle and wonder what it all means. They want something on account.  Upon my Sam, I'm disappointed with Whiteley's. I'd been thinking in  rather a kindly spirit of them, and feeling that they were a more  intelligent lot than Harrod's. I'd had half a mind to give Harrod's the  miss-in-baulk and hand my whole trade over to these fellows. But not  now, dash it! Whiteley's have disappointed me. From the way they write,  you'd think they thought I was doing it for fun. How can I let them  have their infernal money when there isn't any? Here's one from  Dorchester. Smith, the chap we got the gramophone from. Wants to know  when I'm going to settle up for sixteen records.\"    \"Sordid brute!\"    I wanted to get on with my own correspondence, but Ukridge held me with  a glittering eye.    \"The chicken-men, the dealer people, you know, want me to pay for the  first lot of hens. Considering that they all died of roop, and that I  was going to send them back anyhow after I'd got them to hatch out a  few chickens, I call that cool. I mean to say, business is business.  That's what these fellows don't seem to understand. I can't afford to  pay enormous sums for birds which die off quicker than I can get them  in.\"    \"I shall never speak to Aunt Elizabeth again,\" said Mrs. Ukridge  suddenly.    She had dropped the letter she had been reading, and was staring  indignantly in front of her. There were two little red spots on her  cheeks.    \"What's the matter, old chap?\" inquired Ukridge affectionately,  glancing up from his pile of bills and forgetting his own troubles in  an instant. \"Buck up! Aunt Elizabeth been getting on your nerves again?  What's she been saying this time?\"    Mrs. Ukridge left the room with a sob. Ukridge sprang at the letter.    \"If that demon doesn't stop writing her infernal letters and upsetting  Millie, I shall strangle her with my bare hands, regardless of her age  and sex.\" He turned over the pages of the letter till he came to the  passage which had caused the trouble. \"Well, upon my Sam! Listen to  this, Garny, old horse. 'You tell me nothing regarding the success of  this chicken farm of yours, and I confess that I find your silence  ominous. You know my opinion of your husband. He is perfectly helpless  in any matter requiring the exercise of a little common-sense and  business capability.'\" He stared at me, amazed. \"I like that! 'Pon my  soul, that is really rich! I could have believed almost anything of  that blighted female, but I did think she had a reasonable amount of  intelligence. Why, you know that it's just in matters requiring  common-sense and business capability that I come out really strong.\"    \"Of course, old man,\" I replied dutifully. \"The woman's a fool.\"    \"That's what she calls me two lines further on. No wonder Millie was  upset. Why can't these cats"]]]
