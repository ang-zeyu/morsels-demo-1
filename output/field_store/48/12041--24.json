Unnerved, we made room: the q-b  cried again: in came the host with a subtle smile and a pin and an air  of benevolence, and tamed the brute.    What else was there to eat? There was a piece of fried pork for me, and  boiled eggs for the q-b. As we were proceeding with these, in came the  remainder of the night's entertainment: three station officials, two in  scarlet peaked caps, one in a black-and-gold peaked cap. They sat down  with a clamour, in their caps, as if there was a sort of invisible  screen between us and them. They were young. The black cap had a lean  and sardonic look: one of the red-caps was little and ruddy, very young,  with a little mustache: we called him the _maialino_, the gay little  black pig, he was so plump and food-nourished and frisky. The third was  rather puffy and pale and had spectacles. They all seemed to present us  the blank side of their cheek, and to intimate that no, they were not  going to take their hats off, even if it were dinner-table and a strange  _signora_. And they made rough quips with one another, still as if we  were on the other side of the invisible screen.    Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said  Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,  it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than  _fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their  caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the  soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what  was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they  pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,  cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then.    And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I  heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from  their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the  treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking  vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to  dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And  the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was  led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary  matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of  bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue  against his palate. As children we used to call this \"clapping\".    \"Mother, she's clapping!\" I would yell with anger, against my sister.  The German word is schmatzen.    So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and  bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.    At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the  beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and  cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked  all.    The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard  crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The  _maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had  got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch  white. He was a swell with this white bread.    Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we  going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone.    \"I _like_ Sardinia,\" cried the q-b.    \"Why?\" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out.    \"Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,\" said I.    \"Why?\" he asked sarcastically.    \"They are more open--more honest.\" He seemed to turn his nose down.    \"The padrone is a Sicilian,\" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block  of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,  well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much  headway.    \"You've seen Cagliari?\" the black-cap said to me, like a threat.    \"Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!\" cried the q-b,  who travels with a vial of melted butter ready for her parsnips.    \"Yes--Cagliari is _so-so_--Cagliari is very fair,\" said the black cap.  \"_Cagliari e discreto._\" He was evidently proud of it.    \"And is Mandas nice?\" asked the q-b.    \"In what way nice?\" they asked, with immense sarcasm.    \"Is there anything to see?\"    \"Hens,\" said the _maialino_ briefly. They all bristled when one asked if  Mandas was nice.    \"What does one do here?\" asked the q-b.    \"_Niente!_ At Mandas one does _nothing_. At Mandas one goes to bed when  it's dark, like a chicken. At Mandas one walks down the road like a pig  that is going nowhere. At Mandas a goat understands more than the  inhabitants understand. At Mandas one needs socialism....\"    They all cried out at once. Evidently Mandas was more than flesh and  blood could bear for another minute to these three conspirators.    \"Then you are very bored here?\" say I.    \"Yes.\"    And the quiet intensity of that naked yes spoke more than volumes.    \"You would like to be in Cagliari?\"    \"Yes.\"    Silence, intense, sardonic silence had intervened. The three looked at  one another and made a sour joke about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned  to me.    \"Can you understand Sardinian?\" he said.    \"Somewhat. More than Sicilian, anyhow.\"    \"But Sardinian is more difficult than Sicilian. It is full of words  utterly unknown to Italian--\"    \"Yes, but,\" say I, \"it is spoken openly, in plain words, and Sicilian is  spoken all stuck together, none of the words there at all.\"    He looks at me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite  easy to understand Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question  of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and  downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want  to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an  over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his  mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen  minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of  them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The  Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I  bump up against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for  example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow  Socialism whole: much too ancient and ruse not to be sophisticated about  any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder  acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with  him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.    \"Where do you find such white bread?\" say I to the black cap, because he  is proud of it.    \"It comes from my home.\" And then he asks about the bread of Sicily. Is  it any whiter than _this_--the Mandas rock. Yes, it is a little whiter.  At which they gloom again. For it is a very sore point, this bread.  Bread means a great deal to an Italian: it is verily his staff of life.  He practically lives on bread. And instead of going by taste, he now,  like all the world, goes by eye. He has got it into his head that bread  should be white, so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the  loaf a shadow falls on his soul. Nor is he altogether wrong. For  although, personally, I don't like white bread any more, yet I do like  my brown bread to be made of pure, unmixed flour. The peasants in  Sicily, who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown  bread, ah, it is amazing how fresh and sweet and _clean_ their loaf  seems, so perfumed as home-bread used all to be before the war. Whereas  the bread of the commune, the regulation supply, is hard, and rather  coarse and rough, so rough and harsh on the palate. One gets tired to  death of it. I suspect myself the maize meal mixed in. But I don't know.  And finally the bread varies immensely from town to town, from commune  to commune. The so-called just and equal distribution is all my-eye. One  place has abundance of good sweet bread, another scrapes along, always  stinted, on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff. And the poor suffer  bitterly, really, from the bread-stinting, because they depend so on  this one food. They say the inequality and the injustice of distribution  comes from the Camorra--la grande Camorra--which is no more nowadays  than a profiteering combine, which the poor hate. But for myself, I  don't know. I only know that one town--Venice, for example--seems to  have an endless supply of pure bread, of sugar, of tobacco, of  salt--while Florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the  stinting of these supplies--which are all government monopoly, doled out  accordingly.    We said Good-night to our three railway friends, and went up to bed. We  had only been in the room a minute or two, when the brown woman tapped:  and if you please, the black-cap had sent us one of his little white  loaves. We were really touched. Such delicate little generosities have  almost disappeared from the world.    It was a queer little bread--three-cornered, and almost as hard as ships  biscuit, made of starch flour. Not strictly bread at all.           *       *       *       *       *    The night was cold, the blankets flat and heavy, but one slept quite  well till dawn. At seven o'clock it was a clear, cold morning, the sun  not yet up. Standing at the bedroom window looking out, I could hardly  believe my eyes it was so like England, like Cornwall in the bleak  parts, or Derbyshire uplands. There was a little paddock-garden at the  back of the Station, rather tumble-down, with two sheep in it. There  were several forlorn-looking out-buildings, very like Cornwall. And then  the wide, forlorn country road stretched away between borders of grass  and low, drystone walls, towards a grey stone farm with a tuft of trees,  and a naked stone village in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#18)"],[1,"stood a  tent, and, as the pursuers stumbled among the cords, he escaped behind  Ottigny's house, sprang through the breach in the western rampart, and  fled for the woods.    Le Moyne had been one of the guard. Scarcely had he thrown himself into  a hammock which was slung in his room, when a savage shout, and a wild  uproar of shrieks, outcries, and the clash of weapons, brought him to  his feet. He rushed by two Spaniards in the doorway, ran behind the  guard-house, leaped through an embrasure into the ditch, and escaped to  the forest.    Challeux, the carpenter, was going betimes to his work, a chisel in  his hand. He was old, but pike and partisan brandished at his back gave  wings to his flight. In the ecstasy of his terror, he leaped upward,  clutched the top of the palisade, and threw himself over with the  agility of a boy. He ran up the hill, no one pursuing, and, as he neared  the edge of the forest, turned and looked back. From the high ground  where he stood, he could see the butchery, the fury of the conquerors,  and the agonizing gestures of the victims. He turned again in horror,  and plunged into the woods. As he tore his way through the briers  and thickets, he met several fugitives escaped like himself. Others  presently came up, haggard and wild, like men broken loose from the jaws  of death. They gathered together and consulted. One of them, known as  Master Robert, in great repute for his knowledge of the Bible, was for  returning and surrendering to the Spaniards. \"They are men,\" he said;  \"perhaps, when their fury is over, they will spare our lives; and, even  if they kill us, it will only be a few moments' pain. Better so, than to  starve here in the woods, or be torn to pieces by wild beasts.\"    The greater part of the naked and despairing company assented, but  Challeux was of a different mind. The old Huguenot quoted Scripture,  and called the names of prophets and apostles to witness, that, in the  direst extremity, God would not abandon those who rested their faith  in Him. Six of the fugitives, however, still held to their desperate  purpose. Issuing from the woods, they descended towards the fort, and,  as with beating hearts their comrades watched the result, a troop of  Spaniards rushed out, hewed them down with swords and halberds, and  dragged their bodies to the brink of the river, where the victims of the  massacre were already flung in heaps.    Le Moyne, with a soldier named Grandehemin, whom he had met in his  flight, toiled all day through the woods and marshes, in the hope of  reaching the small vessels anchored behind the bar. Night found them in  a morass. No vessel could be seen, and the soldier, in despair, broke  into angry upbraidings against his companion,--saying that he would go  back and give himself up. Le Moyne at first opposed him, then yielded.  But when they drew near the fort, and heard the uproar of savage revelry  that rose from within, the artist's heart failed him. He embraced his  companion, and the soldier advanced alone. A party of Spaniards came out  to meet him. He kneeled, and begged for his life. He was answered by  a death-blow; and the horrified Le Moyne, from his hiding-place in the  thicket, saw his limbs hacked apart, stuck on pikes, and borne off in  triumph.    Meanwhile, Menendez, mustering his followers, had offered thanks to  God for their victory; and this pious butcher wept with emotion as he  recounted the favors which Heaven had showered upon their enterprise.  His admiring historian gives it in proof of his humanity, that, after  the rage of the assault was spent, he ordered that women, infants, and  boys under fifteen should thenceforth be spared. Of these, by his own  account, there were about fifty. Writing in October to the King, he  says that they cause him great anxiety, since he fears the anger of God  should he now put them to death in cold blood, while, on the other hand,  he is in dread lest the venom of their heresy should infect his men.    A hundred and forty-two persons were slain in and around the fort,  and their bodies lay heaped together on the bank of the river. Nearly  opposite was anchored a small vessel, called the \"Pearl,\" commanded by  Jacques Ribaut, son of the Admiral. The ferocious soldiery, maddened  with victory and drunk with blood, crowded to the water's edge, shouting  insults to those on board, mangling the corpses, tearing out their eyes,  and throwing them towards the vessel from the points of their daggers.  Thus did the Most Catholic Philip champion the cause of Heaven in the  New World.    It was currently believed in France, and, though no eye-witness attests  it, there is reason to think it true, that among those murdered at  Fort Caroline there were some who died a death of peculiar ignominy.  Menendez, it is affirmed, hanged his prisoners on trees, and placed  over them the inscription, \"I do this, not as to Frenchmen, but as to  Lutherans.\"    The Spaniards gained a great booty in armor, clothing, and provisions.  \"Nevertheless,\" says the devout Mendoza, after closing his inventory of  the plunder, \"the greatest profit of this victory is the triumph which  our Lord has granted us, whereby His holy Gospel will be introduced  into this country, a thing so needful for saving so many souls from  perdition.\" Again he writes in his journal, \"We owe to God and His  Mother, more than to human strength, this victory over the adversaries  of the holy Catholic religion.\"    To whatever influence, celestial or other, the exploit may best be  ascribed, the victors were not yet quite content with their success. Two  small French vessels, besides that of Jacques Ribaut, still lay within  range of the fort. When the storm had a little abated, the cannon were  turned on them. One of them was sunk, but Ribaut, with the others,  escaped down the river, at the mouth of which several light craft,  including that bought from the English, had been anchored since the  arrival of his father's squadron.    While this was passing, the wretched fugitives were flying from the  scene of massacre through a tempest, of whose persistent violence all  the narratives speak with wonder. Exhausted, starved, half naked,--for  most of them had escaped in their shirts,--they pushed their toilsome  way amid the ceaseless wrath of the elements. A few sought refuge in  Indian villages; but these, it is said, were afterwards killed by the  Spaniards. The greater number attempted to reach the vessels at the  mouth of the river. Among the latter was Le Moyne, who, notwithstanding  his former failure, was toiling through the mazes of tangled forests,  when he met a Belgian soldier, with the woman described as Laudonniere's  maid-servant, who was wounded in the breast; and, urging their flight  towards the vessels, they fell in with other fugitives, including  Laudonniere himself. As they struggled through the salt marsh, the  rank sedge cut their naked limbs, and the tide rose to their waists.  Presently they descried others, toiling like themselves through the  matted vegetation, and recognized Challeux and his companions, also in  quest of the vessels. The old man still, as he tells us, held fast to  his chisel, which had done good service in cutting poles to aid the  party to cross the deep creeks that channelled the morass. The united  band, twenty-six in all, were cheered at length by the sight of a  moving sail. It was the vessel of Captain Mallard, who, informed of the  massacre, was standing along shore in the hope of picking up some of  the fugitives. He saw their signals, and sent boats to their rescue; but  such was their exhaustion, that, had not the sailors, wading to their  armpits among the rushes, borne them out on their shoulders, few could  have escaped. Laudonniere was so feeble that nothing but the support of  a soldier, who held him upright in his arms, had saved him from drowning  in the marsh.    On gaining the friendly decks, the fugitives counselled together. One  and all, they sickened for the sight of France.    After waiting a few days, and saving a few more stragglers from the  marsh, they prepared to sail. Young Ribaut, though ignorant of his  father's fate, assented with something more than willingness; indeed,  his behavior throughout had been stamped with weakness and poltroonery.  On the twenty-fifth of September they put to sea in two vessels; and,  after a voyage the privations of which were fatal to many of them, they  arrived, one party at Rochelle, the other at Swansea, in Wales.          CHAPTER VIII    1565.    MASSACRE OF THE HERETICS.    In suspense and fear, hourly looking seaward for the dreaded fleet of  Jean Ribaut, the chaplain Mendoza and his brother priests held watch and  ward at St. Augustine in the Adelantado's absence. Besides the celestial  guardians whom they ceased not to invoke, they had as protectors  Bartholomew Menendez, the brother of the Adelantado, and about a  hundred soldiers. Day and night they toiled to throw up earthworks and  strengthen their position.    A week elapsed, when they saw a man running towards them, shouting as he  ran.    Mendoza went to meet him.    \"Victory! victory!\" gasped the breathless messenger. \"The French fort is  ours!\" And he flung his arms about the chaplain's neck.'    \"To-day,\" writes the priest in his journal, \"Monday, the twenty-fourth,  came our good general himself, with fifty soldiers, very tired, Like all  those who were with him. As soon as they told me he was coming, I ran to  my lodging, took a new cassock, the best I had, put on my surplice, and  went out to meet him with a crucifix in my hand; whereupon he, like a  gentleman and a good Christian, kneeled down with all his followers,  and gave the Lord a thousand thanks for the great favors he had received  from Him.\"    In solemn procession, with four priests in front chanting Te Deum, the  victors entered St. Augustine in triumph.    On the twenty-eighth, when the"]]]
