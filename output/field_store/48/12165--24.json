However, you must remember that part of the gang got  away, so all I can say positively is that we didn't see, or hear about,  any thionite. There was some gossip, of course: but you know there  always is.\"    \"Of course. Thanks, Sid.\" Jill could feel the brilliant Martian's  mental gears whirl and click. Then he went into such a flashing  exchange of thought with the Venerian that the girl lost track in  seconds.    \"One more question, Miss Samms?\" DalNalten asked. \"Have you detected  any indications that there may be some connection between either Ossmen  or Morgan and any officer or executive of Interstellar Spaceways?\"    \"_Spaceways!_ Isaacson?\" Jill caught her breath. \"Why ... nobody even  thought of such a thing--at least, nobody ever mentioned it to me--I  never thought of making any such tests.\"    \"The possibility occurred to me only a moment ago, at your mention of  thionite. The connection, if any exists, will be exceedingly difficult  to trace. But since most, if not all, of the parties involved will  probably be included in your Operation Mateese, and since a finding,  either positive or negative, would be tremendously significant, we feel  emboldened to ask you to keep this point in mind.\"    \"Why, of course I will. I'll be very glad to.\"    \"We thank you for your courtesy and your help. One or both of us will  get in touch with you from time to time, now that we know the pattern  of your personality. May immortal Grolossen speed the healing of your  father's wound.\"          CHAPTER 7      Late that night--or, rather, very early the following morning--Senator  Morgan and his Number One secretary were closeted in the former's  doubly spy-ray-proofed office. Morgan's round, heavy, florid face had  perhaps lost a little of its usual color; the fingers of his left hand  drummed soundlessly upon the glass top of his desk. His shrewd gray  eyes, however, were as keen and as calculating as ever.    \"This thing smells, Herkimer ... it _reeks_ ... but I can't figure  any of the angles. That operation was _planned_. Sure fire, it  _couldn't_ miss. Right up to the last split second it worked perfectly.  Then--blooie! A flat bust. The Patrol landed and everything was under  control. There _must_ have been a leak somewhere--but where in hell  could it have been?\"    \"There couldn't have been a leak, Chief; it doesn't make sense.\"  The secretary uncrossed his long legs, recrossed them in the other  direction, threw away a half-smoked cigarette, lit another. \"If there'd  been any kind of a leak they would have done a lot more than just  kill the low man on the ladder. You know as well as I do that Rocky  Kinnison is the hardest-boiled character this side of hell. If he had  known anything, he would have killed everybody in sight, including you  and me. Besides, if there had been a leak, he would not have let Samms  get within ten thousand miles of the place--that's one sure thing.  Another is he wouldn't have waited until after it was all over to get  his army there. No, Chief, there couldn't have been a leak. Whatever  Samms or Kinnison found out--probably Samms, he's a hell of a lot  smarter than Kinnison is, you know--he learned right there and then. He  must have seen Brainerd start to pull his gun.\"    \"I thought of that. I'd buy it, except for one fact. Apparently you  didn't time the interval between the shots and the arrival of the  tanks.\"    \"Sorry, Chief.\" Herkimer's face was a study in chagrin. \"I made a bad  slip there.\"    \"I'll say you did. One minute and fifty eight seconds.\"    \"_What!_\"    Morgan remained silent.    \"The patrol is fast, of course ... and always ready ... and they would  yank the stuff in on tractor beams, not under their own power ... but  even so ... five minutes, is my guess, Chief. Four and a half, absolute  minimum.\"    \"Check. And where do you go from there?\"    \"I see your point. I don't. That blows everything wide open. One set of  facts says there was a leak, which occurred between two and a half and  three minutes before the signal was given. I ask you, Chief, does that  make sense?\"    \"No. That's what is bothering me. As you say, the facts seem to be  contradictory. Somebody must have learned something before anything  happened; but if they did, why didn't they do more? And Murgatroyd.  If they didn't know about him, why the ships--especially the big  battlewagons? If they did think he might be out there somewhere, why  didn't they go and find out?\"    \"Now I'll ask one. Why didn't our Mr. Murgatroyd do something? Or  wasn't the pirate fleet supposed to be in on this? Probably not,  though.\"    \"My guess would be the same as yours. Can't see any reason for having  a fleet cover a one-man operation, especially as well-planned a one as  this was. But that's none of our business. These Lensmen are. I was  watching them every second. Neither Samms nor Kinnison did anything  whatever during that two minutes.\"    \"Young Kinnison and Northrop each left the hall about that time.\"    \"I know it. So they did. Either one of them _could_ have called the  Patrol--but what has that to do with the price of beef C. I. F.  Valeria?\"    Herkimer refrained tactfully from answering the savage question. Morgan  drummed and thought for minutes, then went on slowly:    \"There are two, and only two, possibilities; neither of which seem even  remotely possible. It was--_must_ have been--either the Lens or the  girl.\"    \"The girl? Act your age, Senator. I knew where _she_ was, and what she  was doing, every second.\"    \"That was evident.\" Morgan stopped drumming and smiled cynically. \"I'm  getting a hell of a kick out of seeing you taking it, for a change,  instead of dishing it out.\"    \"Yes?\" Herkimer's handsome face hardened. \"That game isn't over, my  friend.\"    \"That's what _you_ think,\" the Senator jibed. \"Can't believe that any  woman _can_ be Herkimer-proof, eh? You've been working on her for six  weeks now, instead of the usual six hours, and you haven't got anywhere  yet.\"    \"I will, Senator.\" Herkimer's nostrils flared viciously. \"I'll get her,  one way or another, if it's the last thing I ever do.\"    \"I'll give you eight to five you don't; and a six-month time limit.\"    \"I'll take five thousand of that. But what makes you think that she's  anything to be afraid of? She's a trained psychologist, yes; but so am  I; and I'm older and more experienced than she is. That leaves that  yoga stuff--her learning how to sit cross-legged, how to contemplate  her navel, and how to try to get in tune with the infinite. How do you  figure _that_ puts her in my class?\"    \"I told you, I don't. Nothing makes sense. But she is Virgil Samms'  daughter.\"    \"What of it? You didn't gag on George Olmstead--you picked him yourself  for one of the toughest jobs we've got. By blood he's just about as  close to Virgil Samms as Virgilia is. They might as well have been  hatched out of the same egg.\"    \"Physically, yes. Mentally and psychologically, no. Olmstead is a  realist, a materialist. He wants his reward in this world, not the  next, and is out to get it. Furthermore, the job will probably kill  him, and even if it doesn't, he will never be in a position of trust  or where he can learn much of anything. On the other hand, Virgil Samms  is--but I don't need to tell you what _he_ is like. But you don't seem  to realize that she's just like him--she isn't playing around with you  because of your overpowering charm....\"    \"Listen, Chief. She didn't know anything and she didn't do anything. I  was dancing with her all the time, as close as that,\" he clasped his  hands tightly together, \"so I know what I'm talking about. And if you  think she could _ever_ learn anything from me, skip it. You know that  nobody on Earth, or anywhere else, can read my face; and besides, she  was playing coy right then--wasn't even looking at me. So count her  out.\"    \"We'll have to, I guess.\" Morgan resumed his quiet drumming. \"If there  were any possibility that she pumped you I'd send you to the mines, but  there's no sign ... that leaves the Lens. It has seemed, right along,  more logical than the girl--but a lot more fantastic. Been able to find  out anything more about it?\"    \"No. Just what they've been advertising. Combination radio-phone,  automatic language-converter, telepath, and so on. Badge of the top  skimmings of the top-bracket cops. But I began to think, out there on  the floor, that they aren't advertising everything they know.\"    \"So did I. You tell me.\"    \"Take the time zero minus three minutes. Besides the five Lensmen--and  Jill Samms--the place was full of top brass; scrambled eggs all over  the floor. Commodores and lieutenant-Commodores from all continental  governments of the Earth, the other planets, and the colonies, all  wearing full-dress side-arms. Nobody knew anything then; we agree on  that. But within the next few seconds, somebody found out something  and called for help. One of the Lensmen could possibly have done that  without showing signs. BUT--at zero time all four Lensmen had their  guns out--and _not_ Lewistons, please note--and were shooting; whereas  none of the other armed officers knew that anything was going on until  after it was all over. That puts the finger on the Lens.\"    \"That's the way I figured it. But the difficulties remain unchanged.  _How?_ Mind-reading?\"    \"Space-drift!\" Herkimer snorted. \"My mind can't be read.\"    \"Nor mine.\"    \"And besides, if they could read minds, they wouldn't have waited  until the last possible split second to do it, unless ... say, wait a  minute!... Did Brainerd act or look nervous, toward the last? I wasn't  to look at him, you know.\"    \"Not nervous, exactly; but he did get a little tense.\"    \"There you are, then. Hired murderers aren't smart. A Lensman saw  him tighten up and got suspicious. Turned in the alarm on general  principles. Warned the others to keep on their toes. But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#18)"],[1,"in Nature is chiefly the result of physical and  chemical changes, but there is reason for believing that the  physical and chemical processes are, to a slight extent at least,  assisted by bacterial life.    A more important factor of soil fertility is its nitrogen content,  without which it is completely barren. The origin of these  nitrogen ingredients has been more or less of a puzzle. Fertile  soil everywhere contains nitrates and other nitrogen compounds,  and in certain parts of the world there are large accumulations of  these compounds, like the nitrate beds of Chili. That they have  come ultimately from the free atmospheric nitrogen seems certain,  and various attempts have been made to explain a method of this  nitrogen fixation. It has been suggested that electrical  discharges in the air may form nitric acid, which would readily  then unite with soil ingredients to form nitrates. There is little  reason, however, for believing this to be a very important factor  But in the soil bacteria we find undoubtedly an efficient agency m  this nitrogen fixation. As already seen, the bacteria are able to  seize the free atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into nitrite  and nitrates. We have also learned that they can act in connection  with legumes and some other plants, enabling them to fix  atmospheric nitrogen and store it m their roots. By these two  means the nitrogen ingredient in the soil is prevented from  becoming exhausted by the processes of dissipation constantly  going on. Further, by some such agency must we imagine the  original nitrogen soil ingredient to have been derived. Such an  organic agency is the only one yet discerned which appears to have  been efficient in furnishing virgin soil with its nitrates, and we  must therefore look upon bacteria as essential to the original  fertility of the soil. But in another direction still does the  farmer depend directly upon bacteria The most important factor in  the fertility of the soil is the part of it called humus. This  humus is very complex, and never alike in different soils It  contains nitrogen compounds in abundance, together with sulphates,  phosphates, sugar, and many other substances. It is this which  makes the garden soil different from sand, or the rich soil  different from the sterile soil. If the soil is cultivated year  after year, its food ingredients are slowly but surely exhausted.  Something is taken from the humus each year, and unless this be  replaced the soil ceases to be able to support life. To keep up a  constant yield from the soil the farmer understands that he must  apply fertilizers more or less constantly.    This application of fertilizers is simply feeding the crops. Some  of these fertilizers the farmer purchases, and knows little or  nothing as to their origin. The most common method of feeding the  crops is, however, by the use of ordinary barnyard manure. The  reason why this material contains plant food we can understand,  since it is made of the undigested part of food, together with all  the urea and other excretions of animals, and contains, therefore,  besides various minerals, all of the nitrogenous waste of animal  life. These secretions are not at first fit for plant food. The  farmer has learned by experience that such excretions, before they  are of any use on his fields, must undergo a process of slow  change, which is sometimes called ripening. Fresh manure is  sometimes used on the fields, but it is only made use of by the  plants after the ripening process has occurred. Fresh animal  excretions are of little or no value as a fertilizer. The farmer,  therefore, commonly allows it to remain in heaps for some time,  and it undergoes a slow change, which gradually converts it into a  condition in which it can be used by plants. This ripening is  readily explained by the facts already considered The fresh animal  secretions consist of various highly complex compounds of  nitrogen, and the ripening is a process of their decomposition.  The proteids are broken to pieces, and their nitrogen elements  reduced to the form of nitrates, leucin, etc, or even to ammonia  or free nitrogen. Further, a second process occurs, the process of  oxidation of these nitrogen compounds already noticed, and the  ammonia and nitrites resulting from the decomposition are built  into nitrates. In short, in this ripening manure the processes  noticed in the first part of this chapter are taking place, by  which the complex nitrogenous bodies are first reduced and then  oxidized to form plant food. The ripening of manure is both an  analytical and a synthetical process. By the analysis, proteids  and other bodies are broken into very simple compounds, some of  them, indeed, being dissipated into the air, but other portions  are retained and then oxidized, and these latter become the real  fertilizing materials. Through the agency of bacteria the compost  heap thus becomes the great source of plant food to the farmer.  Into this compost heap he throws garbage, straw, vegetable and  animal substances in general, or any organic refuse which may be  at hand. The various bacteria seize it all, and cause the  decomposition which converts it into plant food again. The rotting  of the compost heap is thus a gigantic cultivation of bacteria.    This knowledge of the ripening process is further teaching the  farmer how to prevent waste. In the ordinary decomposition of the  compost heap not an inconsiderable portion of the nitrogen is lost  in the air by dissipation as ammonia or free nitrogen. Even his  nitrates may be thus lost by bacterial action. This portion is  lost to the farmer completely, and he can only hope to replace it  either by purchasing nitrates in the form of commercial  fertilizers, or by reclaiming it from the air by the use of the  bacterial agencies already noticed. With the knowledge now at his  command he is learning to prevent this waste. In the decomposition  one large factor of loss is the ammonia, which, being a gas, is  readily dissipated into the air. Knowing this common result of  bacterial action, the scientist has told the farmer that, by  adding certain common chemicals to his decomposing manure heap,  chemicals which will readily unite with ammonia, he may retain  most of the nitrogen in this heap in the form of ammonia salts,  which, once formed, no longer show a tendency to dissipate into  the air. Ordinary gypsum, or superphosphates, or plaster will  readily unite with ammonia, and these added to the manure heap  largely counteract the tendency of the nitrogen to waste, thus  enabling the farmer to put back into his soil most of the nitrogen  which was extracted from it by his crops and then used by his  stock. His vegetable crops raise the nitrates into proteids. His  animals feed upon the proteids, and perform his work or furnish  him with milk. Then his bacteria stock take the excreted or refuse  nitrogen, and in his manure heap turn it back again into nitrates  ready to begin the circle once more. This might go on almost  indefinitely were it not for two facts, the farmer sends  nitrogenous material off his farm in the milk or grains or other  nitrogenous products, which he sells, and the decomposition  processes, as we have seen, dissipate some of the nitrogen into  the air as free nitrogen.    To meet this emergency and loss the farmer has another method of  enriching the soil, again depending upon bacteria. This is the so-  called green manuring. Here certain plants which seize nitrogen  from the air are cultivated upon the field to be fertilized, and,  instead of harvesting a crop, it is ploughed into the soil. Or  perhaps the tops may be harvested, the rest being ploughed into  the soil. The vegetable material thus ploughed in lies over a  season and enriches the soil. Here the bacteria of the soil come  into play in several directions. First, if the crop sowed be a  legume, the soil bacteria assist it to seize the nitrogen from the  air. The only plants which are of use in this green manuring are  those which can, through the agency of bacteria, obtain nitrogen  from the air and store it in their roots. Second, after the crop  is ploughed into the soil various decomposing bacteria seize upon  it, pulling the compounds to pieces. The carbon is largely  dissipated into the air as carbonic dioxide, where the next  generation of plants can get hold of it. The minerals and the  nitrogen remain in the soil. The nitrogenous portions go through  the same series of decomposition and synthetical changes already  described, and thus eventually the nitrogen seized from the air by  the combined action of the legumes and the bacteria is converted  into nitrates, and will serve for food for the next set of plants  grown on the same soil. Here is thus a practical method of using  the nitrogen assimilation powers of bacteria, and reclaiming  nitrogen from the air to replace that which has been lost. Thus it  is that the farmer's nitrogen problem of the fertile soil appears  to resolve itself into a proper handling of bacteria. These  organisms have stocked his soil in the first place. They convert  all of his compost heap wastes into simple bodies, some of which  are changed into plant foods, while others are at the same time  lost. Lastly, they may be made to reclaim this lost nitrogen, and  the fanner, so soon as he has requisite knowledge of these facts,  will be able to keep within his control the supply of this  important element. The continued fertility of the soil is thus a  gift from the bacteria.    BACTERIA AS SOURCES OF TROUBLE TO THE FARMER.    While the topics already considered comprise the most important  factors in agricultural bacteriology, the farmer's relations to  bacteria do not end here. These organisms come incidentally into  his life in many ways. They are not always his aids as they are in  most of the instances thus far cited. They produce disease in his  cattle, as"]]]
