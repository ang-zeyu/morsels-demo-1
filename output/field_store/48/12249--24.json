'They have a few technical privileges, which it  would be a matter of some little time to explain.'    'It must be very pleasant to be a prefect at St Austin's,' said Sir  Alfred nastily. 'Very pleasant indeed. Might I ask, Mr Perceval, if the  technical privileges to which you refer include--smoking?'    The Head started as if, supposing such a thing possible, someone had  pinched him. He did not know what to make of the question. From the  expression on his face his visitor did not appear to be perpetrating a  joke.    'No,' he said sharply, 'they do not include smoking.'    'I merely asked because this was found by my keeper on the boy when he  caught him.'    He produced a small silver match-box. The Head breathed again. The  reputation of the School-prefect, though shaky, was still able to come  up to the scratch.    'A match-box is scarcely a proof that a boy has been smoking, I think,'  said he. 'Many boys carry matches for various purposes, I believe. I  myself, though a non-smoker, frequently place a box in my pocket.'    For answer Sir Alfred laid a bloated and exceedingly vulgar-looking  plush tobacco-pouch on the table beside the match-box.    'That also,' he observed, 'was found in his pocket by my keeper.'    He dived his hand once more into his coat. 'And also this,' he said.    And, with the air of a card-player who trumps his opponent's ace, he  placed on the pouch a pipe. And, to make the matter, if possible,  worse, the pipe was not a new pipe. It was caked within and coloured  without, a pipe that had seen long service. The only mitigating  circumstance that could possibly have been urged in favour of the  accused, namely that of 'first offence', had vanished.    'It is pleasant,' said Sir Alfred with laborious sarcasm, 'to find a  trespasser doing a thing which has caused the dismissal of several  keepers. Smoking in my woods I--will--not--permit. I will not have my  property burnt down while I can prevent it. Good evening, Mr Perceval.'  With these words he made a dramatic exit.    For some minutes after he had gone the Head remained where he stood,  thinking. Then he went across the room and touched the bell.    'Parker,' he said, when that invaluable officer appeared, 'go across to  Mr Ward's House, and tell him I wish to see Plunkett. Say I wish to see  him at once.'    'Yessir.'    After ten minutes had elapsed, Plunkett entered the room, looking  nervous.    'Sit down, Plunkett.'    Plunkett collapsed into a seat. His eye had caught sight of the smoking  apparatus on the table.    The Head paced the room, something after the fashion of the tiger at  the Zoo, whose clock strikes lunch.    'Plunkett,' he said, suddenly, 'you are a School-prefect.'    'Yes, sir,' murmured Plunkett. The fact was undeniable.    'You know the duties of a School-prefect?'    'Yes, sir.'    'And yet you deliberately break one of the most important rules of the  School. How long have you been in the habit of smoking?'    Plunkett evaded the question.    'My father lets me smoke, sir, when I'm at home.'    (A hasty word in the reader's ear. If ever you are accused of smoking,  please--for my sake, if not for your own--try to refrain from saying  that your father lets you do it at home. It is a fatal mistake.)    At this, to employ a metaphor, the champagne of the Head's wrath, which  had been fermenting steadily during his late interview, got the better  of the cork of self-control, and he exploded. If the Mutual Friend ever  has grandchildren he will probably tell them with bated breath the  story of how the Head paced the room, and the legend of the things he  said. But it will be some time before he will be able to speak about it  with any freedom. At last there was a lull in the storm.    'I am not going to expel you, Plunkett. But you cannot come back after  the holidays. I will write to your father to withdraw you.' He pointed  to the door. Plunkett departed in level time.    'What did the Old 'Un want you for?' asked Dallas, curiously, when he  returned to the study.    Plunkett had recovered himself by this time sufficiently to be able to  tell a lie.    'He wanted to tell me he'd heard from my father about my leaving.'    'About your leaving!' Dallas tried to keep his voice as free as  possible from triumphant ecstasy.    'Are you leaving? When?'    'This term.'    'Oh!' said Dallas. It was an uncomfortable moment. He felt that at  least some conventional expression of regret ought to proceed from him.    'Don't trouble to lie about being sorry,' said Plunkett with a sneer.    'Thanks,' said Dallas, gratefully, 'since you mention it, I rather  think I won't.'          [14]    THE LONG RUN      Vaughan came up soon afterwards, and Dallas told him the great news.  They were neither of them naturally vindictive, but the Mutual Friend  had been a heavy burden to them during his stay in the House, and they  did not attempt to conceal from themselves their unfeigned pleasure at  the news of his impending departure.    'I'll never say another word against Mr Plunkett, senior, in my life,'  said Vaughan. 'He's a philanthropist. I wonder what the Mutual's going  to do? Gentleman of leisure, possibly. Unless he's going to the  'Varsity.'    'Same thing, rather. I don't know a bit what he's going to do, and I  can't say I care much. He's going, that's the main point.'    'I say,' said Vaughan. 'I believe the Old Man was holding a sort of  reception tonight. I know he had Thomson over to his House. Do you  think there's a row on?'    'Oh, I don't know. Probably only wanted to see if he was all right  after the mile. By Jove, it was a bit of a race, wasn't it?' And the  conversation drifted off into matters athletic.    There were two persons that night who slept badly. Jim lay awake until  the College clock had struck three, going over in his mind the various  points of his difficulties, on the chance of finding a solution of  them. He fell asleep at a quarter past, without having made any  progress. The Head, also, passed a bad night. He was annoyed for many  reasons, principally, perhaps, because he had allowed Sir Alfred Venner  to score so signal a victory over him. Besides that, he was not easy in  his mind about Jim. He could not come to a decision. The evidence was  all against him, but evidence is noted for its untrustworthiness. The  Head would have preferred to judge the matter from his knowledge of  Jim's character. But after the Plunkett episode he mistrusted his  powers in that direction. He thought the matter over for a time, and  then, finding himself unable to sleep, got up and wrote an article for  a leading review on the subject of the Doxology. The article was  subsequently rejected--which proves that Providence is not altogether  incapable of a kindly action--but it served its purpose by sending its  author to sleep.    Barrett, too, though he did not allow it to interfere with his  slumbers, was considerably puzzled as to what he ought to do about the  cups which he had stumbled upon in the wood. He scarcely felt equal to  going to the Dingle again to fetch them, and yet every minute he  delayed made the chances of their remaining there more remote. He  rather hoped that Reade would think of some way out of it. He had a  great respect for Reade's intellect, though he did not always show it.  The next day was the day of the Inter-House cross-country race. It was  always fixed for the afternoon after Sports Day, a most inconvenient  time for it, as everybody who had exerted or over-exerted himself the  afternoon before was unable to do himself justice. Today, contrary to  general expectation, both Drake and Thomson had turned out. The knowing  ones, however, were prepared to bet anything you liked (except cash),  that both would drop out before the first mile was over. Merevale's  pinned their hopes on Welch. At that time Welch had not done much  long-distance running. He confined himself to the hundred yards and the  quarter. But he had it in him to do great things, as he proved in the  following year, when he won the half, and would have beaten the great  Mitchell-Jones record for the mile, but for an accident, or rather an  event, which prevented his running. The tale of which is told  elsewhere.    The course for the race was a difficult one. There were hedges and  brooks to be negotiated, and, worst of all, ploughed fields. The first  ploughed field usually thinned the ranks of the competitors  considerably. The distance was about ten miles.    The race started at three o'clock. Jim and Welch, Merevale's first  string, set the pace from the beginning, and gradually drew away from  the rest. Drake came third, and following him the rest of the Houses in  a crowd.    Welch ran easily and springily; Jim with more effort. He felt from the  start that he could not last. He resolved to do his best for the honour  of the House, but just as the second mile was beginning, the first of  the ploughed fields appeared in view, stretching, so it appeared to  Jim, right up to the horizon. He groaned.    'Go on, Welch,' he gasped. 'I'm done.'    Welch stopped short in his stride, and eyed him critically.    'Yes,' he said, 'better get back to the House. You overdid it  yesterday. Lie down somewhere. G'bye.' And he got into his stride  again. Jim watched his figure diminish, until at last it was a  shapeless dot of white against the brown surface. Then he lay down on  his back and panted.    It was in this attitude that Drake found him. For a moment an almost  irresistible wish seized him to act in the same way. There was an  unstudied comfort about Jim's pose which appealed to him strongly. His  wind still held out, but his legs were beginning to feel as if they did  not belong to him at all. He pulled up for an instant.    'Hullo,' he said, 'done up?'    For reply Jim merely grunted.    'Slacker,' said Drake. 'Where's Welch?'

Reece helped himself, and gave them a brief description of the late  interview.    'I'm not surprised,' said Gethryn, 'I thought Monk would be getting at  me somehow soon. I shall _have_ to slay that chap someday. What  ought I to do, do you think?'    'My dear chap,' said Marriott, 'there's only one thing you can do. Cut  the lot of them out of the team, and fill up with substitutes.'    Reece nodded approval.    'Of course. That's what you must do. As a matter of fact, I told them  you would. I've given you a reputation. You must live up to it.'    'Besides,' continued Marriott, 'after all it isn't such a crusher, when  you come to think of it. Only four of them are really certainties for  their places, Monk, Danvers, Waterford, and Saunders. The rest are  simply tail.'    Reece nodded again. 'Great minds think alike. Exactly what I told them,  only they wouldn't listen.'    'Well, whom do you suggest instead of them? Some of the kids are jolly  keen and all that, but they wouldn't be much good against Baynes and  Lorimer, for instance.'    'If I were you,' said Marriott, 'I shouldn't think about their batting  at all. I should go simply for fielding. With a good fielding side we  ought to have quite a decent chance. There's no earthly reason why you  and Reece shouldn't put on enough for the first wicket to win all the  matches. It's been done before. Don't you remember the School House  getting the cup four years ago when Twiss was captain? They had nobody  who was any earthly good except Twiss and Birch, and those two used to  make about a hundred and fifty between them in every match. Besides,  some of the kids can bat rather well. Wilson for one. He can bowl,  too.'    'Yes,' said the Bishop, 'all right. Stick down Wilson. Who else?  Gregson isn't bad. He can field in the slips, which is more than a good  many chaps can.'    'Gregson's good,' said Reece, 'put him down. That makes five. You might  have young Lee in too. I've seen him play like a book at his form net  once or twice.'    'Lee--six. Five more wanted. Where's a House list? Here we are. Now.  Adams, Bond, Brown, Burgess. Burgess has his points. Shall I stick him  down?'    'Not presume to dictate,' said Marriott, 'but Adams is streets better  than Burgess as a field, and just as good a bat.'    'Why, when have you seen him?'    'In a scratch game between his form and another. He was carting all  over the shop. Made thirty something.'    'We'll have both of them in, then. Plenty of room. This is the team so  far. Wilson, Gregson, Lee, Adams, and Burgess, with Marriott, Reece,  and Gethryn. Jolly hot stuff it is, too, by Jove. We'll simply walk  that tankard. Now, for the last places. I vote we each select a man,  and nobody's allowed to appeal against the other's decision. I lead off  with Crowinshaw. Good name, Crowinshaw. Look well on a score sheet.'    'Heave us the list,' said Marriott. 'Thanks. My dear sir, there's only  one man in the running at all, which his name's Chamberlain. Shove down  Joseph, and don't let me hear anyone breathe a word against him. Come  on, Reece, let's have your man. I bet Reece selects some weird rotter.'    Reece pondered.    'Carstairs,' he said.    'Oh, my very dear sir! Carstairs!'    'All criticism barred,' said the Bishop.    'Sorry. By the way, what House are we drawn against in the first  round?'    'Webster's.'    'Ripping. We can smash Webster's. They've got nobody. It'll be rather a  good thing having an easy time in our first game. We shall be able to  get some idea about the team's play. I shouldn't think we could  possibly get beaten by Webster's.'    There was a knock at the door. Wilson came in with a request that he  might fetch a book that he had left in the study.    'Oh, Wilson, just the man I wanted to see,' said the Bishop. 'Wilson,  you're playing against Webster's next week.'    'By Jove,' said Wilson, 'am I really?'    He had spent days in working out on little slips of paper during school  his exact chances of getting a place in the House team. Recently,  however, he had almost ceased to hope. He had reckoned on at least  eight of the senior study being chosen before him.    'Yes,' said the Bishop, 'you must buck up. Practise fielding every  minute of your spare time. Anybody'll hit you up catches if you ask  them.'    'Right,' said Wilson, 'I will.'    'All right, then. Go, and tell Lee that I want to see him.'    'Lee,' said the Bishop, when that worthy appeared, 'I wanted to see  you, to tell you you're playing for the House against Webster's.  Thought you might like to know.'    'By Jove,' said Lee, 'am I really?'    'Yes. Buck up with your fielding.'    'Right,' said Lee.    'That's all. If you're going downstairs, you might tell Adams to come  up.'    For a quarter of an hour the Bishop interviewed the junior members of  his team, and impressed on each of them the absolute necessity of  bucking up with his fielding. And each of them protested that the  matter should receive his best consideration.    'Well, they're keen enough anyway,' said Marriott, as the door closed  behind Carstairs, the last of the new recruits, 'and that's the great  thing. Hullo, who's that? I thought you had worked through the lot.  Come in!'    A small form appeared in the doorway, carrying in its right hand a  neatly-folded note.    'Monk told me to give you this, Gethryn.'    'Half a second,' said the Bishop, as the youth made for the door.  'There may be an answer.'    'Monk said there wouldn't be one.'    'Oh. No, it's all right. There isn't an answer.'    The door closed. The Bishop laughed, and threw the note over to Reece.    'Recognize it?'    Reece examined the paper.    'It's a fair copy. The one Monk showed me was rather smudged. I suppose  they thought you might be hurt if you got an inky round-robin.  Considerate chap, Monk.'    'Let's have a look,' said Marriott. 'By Jove. I say, listen to this  bit. Like Macaulay, isn't it?'    He read extracts from the ultimatum.    'Let's have it,' said Gethryn, stretching out a hand.    'Not much. I'm going to keep it, and have it framed.'    'All right. I'm going down now to put up the list.'    When he had returned to the study, Monk and Danvers came quietly  downstairs to look at the notice-board. It was dark in the passage, and  Monk had to strike a light before he could see to read.    'By George,' he said, as the match flared up, 'Reece was right. He  has.'    'Well, there's one consolation,' commented Danvers viciously, 'they  can't possibly get that cup now. They'll have to put us in again soon,  you see if they don't.'    ''M, yes,' said Monk doubtfully.          [14]    NORRIS TAKES A SHORT HOLIDAY      'It's all rot,' observed Pringle, 'to say that they haven't a chance,  because they have.'    He and Lorimer were passing through the cricket-field on their way back  from an early morning visit to the baths, and had stopped to look at  Leicester's House team (revised version) taking its daily hour of  fielding practice. They watched the performance keenly and critically,  as spies in an enemy's camp.    'Who said they hadn't a chance?' said Lorimer. 'I didn't.'    'Oh, everybody. The chaps call them the Kindergarten and the Kids'  Happy League, and things of that sort. Rot, I call it. They seem to  forget that you only want two or three really good men in a team if the  rest can field. Look at our crowd. They've all either got their  colours, or else are just outside the teams, and I swear you can't rely  on one of them to hold the merest sitter right into his hands.'    On the subject of fielding in general, and catching in particular,  Pringle was feeling rather sore. In the match which his House had just  won against Browning's, he had put himself on to bowl in the second  innings. He was one of those bowlers who manage to capture from six to  ten wickets in the course of a season, and the occasions on which he  bowled really well were few. On this occasion he had bowled  excellently, and it had annoyed him when five catches, five soft,  gentle catches, were missed off him in the course of four overs. As he  watched the crisp, clean fielding which was shown by the very smallest  of Leicester's small 'tail', he felt that he would rather have any of  that despised eight on his side than any of the School House lights  except Baynes and Lorimer.    'Our lot's all right, really,' said Lorimer, in answer to Pringle's  sweeping condemnation. 'Everybody has his off days. They'll be all  right next match.'    'Doubt it,' replied Pringle. 'It's all very well for you. You bowl to  hit the sticks. I don't. Now just watch these kids for a moment. Now!  Look! No, he couldn't have got to that. Wait a second. Now!'    Gethryn had skied one into the deep. Wilson, Burgess, and Carstairs all  started for it.    'Burgess,' called the Bishop.    The other two stopped dead. Burgess ran on and made the catch.    'Now, there you are,' said Pringle, pointing his moral, 'see how those  two kids stopped when Gethryn called. If that had happened in one of  our matches, you'd have had half a dozen men rotting about underneath  the ball, and getting in one another's way, and then probably winding  up by everybody leaving the catch to everybody else.'    'Oh, come on,' said Lorimer, 'you're getting morbid. Why the dickens  didn't you think of having our fellows out for fielding practice, if  you're so keen on it?'    'They wouldn't have come. When a chap gets colours, he seems to think  he's bought the place. You can't drag a Second Eleven man out of his  bed before breakfast to improve his fielding. He thinks it can't be  improved. They're a heart-breaking crew.'    'Good,' said Lorimer, 'I suppose that includes me?'    'No. You're a model man. I have seen you hold a catch now and then.'    'Thanks. Oh, I say, I gave in the poem yesterday. I hope the deuce it  won't get the"]]]
