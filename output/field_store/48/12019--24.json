We shall consider in due order each of the three causes here  enumerated. It may appear that the conditions set forth in these  specifications are more properly to be regarded as effects or results,  than as causes, incident to the general apostasy,--that they are in  the nature of evidences or proofs of a departure from the original  constitution of the Church, rather than specific causes by which the  fact of apostasy is to be explained or accounted for. Cause and  effect, however, are sometimes very intimately associated, and  resulting conditions may furnish the best demonstration of causes in  operation. Each of the conditions given above as a specific cause of  the progressive apostasy was, at its inception, an evidence of  existing unsoundness, and an active cause of the graver results that  followed. Each succeeding manifestation of the spirit of apostasy was  at once the result of earlier disaffection, and the cause of later and  more pronounced developments.      NOTES.    1. _Inordinate Zeal Manifested by Some of the Early Christians_: \"The  sober discretion of the present age will more readily censure than  admire, but can more easily admire than imitate, the fervor of the  first Christians; who, according to the lively expression of Sulpicius  Severus, desired martyrdom with more eagerness than his own  contemporaries solicited a bishopric. The epistles which Ignatius  composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of Asia,  breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary feelings of  human nature. He earnestly beseeches the Romans that when he should be  exposed in the amphitheatre, they would not by their kind but  unreasonable intercession, deprive him of the crown of glory, and he  declares his resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which  might be employed as the instruments of his death. Some stories are  related of the courage of martyrs who actually performed what Ignatius  had intended: who exasperated the fury of the lions, pressed the  executioner to hasten his office, cheerfully leaped into the fires  which were kindled to consume them, and discovered a sensation of joy  and pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite torture.\"--(Gibbon,  \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" ch. XVI.)    2. _Internal Dissensions During Time of Peace_. As stated in the text,  the early part of Diocletian's reign--the period immediately preceding  the outburst of the last great persecution to which the Christians  were subjected--was a time of comparative freedom from opposition, and  this period was characterized by internal disturbances and dissensions  within the Church. Illustrative of the tolerance shown by the emperor  before he became hostile to the Church, and the accompanying decline  of spiritual earnestness among the Christians themselves, Gibbon says:  \"Diocletian and his colleagues frequently conferred the most important  offices on those persons who avowed their abhorrence of the worship of  the gods, but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of  the state. The bishops held an honorable rank in the respective  provinces, and were treated with distinction and respect, not only by  the people, but by the magistrates themselves. Almost in every city  the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the increasing  multitudes of proselytes; and in their place more stately and  capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the  faithful. The corruption of manners and principles so forcibly  lamented by Eusebius, may be considered not only as a consequence, but  as a proof, of the liberty which the Christians enjoyed and abused  under the reign of Diocletian. Prosperity had relaxed the nerves of  discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice prevailed in every congregation.  The presbyters aspired to the episcopal office, which every day became  an object more worthy of their ambition. The bishops who contended  with each other for ecclesiastical preeminence, appeared by their  conduct to claim a secular and tyrannical power in the church; and the  lively faith which still distinguished the Christians from the  Gentiles, was shown much less in their lives than in their  controversial writings.\"--(Gibbon, \"Decline and Fall of the Roman  Empire,\" ch. XVI.)    3. _The Effect of Peace on the Early Church_. \"Disastrous as the  persecutions of the early Christian centuries were, still more  mischievous to the Church were those periods of tranquillity which  intervened between the outbursts of rage which prompted them. Peace  may have her victories no less renowned than those of war; and so,  too, she has her calamities, and they are not less destructive than  those of war. War may destroy nations, but ease and luxury mankind  corrupt--the body and the mind. Especially is peace dangerous to the  church. Prosperity relaxes the reins of discipline; people feel less  and less the need of a sustaining providence; but in adversity the  spirit of man feels after God, and he is correspondingly more devoted  to the service of religion. We shall find the early Christians no  exception to the operation of this influence of repose. Whenever it  was accorded them, either through the mercy or the indifference of the  emperors, internal dissensions, the intrigues of aspiring prelates,  and the rise of heresies, characterized those periods.\"--(B. H.  Roberts, \"A New Witness for God,\" p. 70.)    4. _Schisms and Heresies in the Early Church_. Eusebius, whose  writings date from the early part of the fourth century, cites the  writings of Hegesippus, who lived in the first quarter of the second  century, as follows: \"The same author [Hegesippus] also treats of the  beginning of the heresies that arose about this time, in the following  words: 'But after James the Just had suffered martyrdom, as our Lord  had for the same reason, Simeon, the son of Cleophas, our Lord's  uncle, was appointed the second bishop [of Jerusalem] whom all  proposed as the cousin of our Lord. Hence they called the Church as  yet a virgin, for it was not yet corrupted by vain discourses.  Thebuthis made a beginning, secretly to corrupt it on account of his  not being made bishop. He was one of those seven sects among the  Jewish people. Of these also was Simeon, whence sprang the sect of  Simonians; also Cleobius, from whence came the Cleobians; also  Dositheus, the founder of the Dositheans. From these also sprung the  Gortheonians from Gortheoeus; and also Masbotheans from Masbothoeus.  Hence also the Meandrians, the Marcionists, and Carpocratians and  Valentinians, and Basilidians, and the Saturnillians, every one  introducing his own peculiar opinions, one differing from the other.  From these sprung the false Christs and the false prophets and false  apostles, who divided the unity of the Church by the introduction of  corrupt doctrines against God and against His Christ.\"--(Eusebius,  \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Book IV, ch. 22.)    5. _Early Decline of the Church_: Milner, summing up the conditions  attending the Church at the end of the second century, says: \"And here  we close the view of the second century, which, for the most part  exhibited proofs of divine grace, as strong, or nearly so, as the  first. We have seen the same unshaken and simple faith of Jesus, the  same love of God and of the brethren; and--that in which they  singularly excelled modern Christians--the same heavenly spirit and  victory over the world. But a dark shade is enveloping these divine  glories. The Spirit of God is grieved already by the ambitious  intrusions of self-righteous, argumentative refinements, and Pharisaic  pride; and though it be more common to represent the most sensible  decay of godliness as commencing a century later, to me it seems  already begun.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent. II, ch. 9.)    Mosheim, writing of conditions attending the closing years of the  third century, says: \"The ancient method of ecclesiastical government  seemed in general still to subsist, while, at the same time, by  imperceptible steps, it varied from the primitive rule and degenerated  toward the form of a religious monarchy. * * * This change in the form  of ecclesiastical government was soon followed by a train of vices,  which dishonored the character and authority of those to whom the  administration of the Church was committed. For, though several yet  continued to exhibit to the world illustrative examples of primitive  piety and Christian virtue, yet many were sunk in luxury and  voluptuousness, puffed up with vanity, arrogance and ambition,  possessed with a spirit of contention and discord, and addicted to  many other vices that cast an undeserved reproach upon the holy  religion of which they were the unworthy professors and ministers.  This is testified in such an ample manner by the repeated complaints  of many of the most respectable writers of this age, that truth will  not permit us to spread the veil, which we should otherwise be  desirous to cast over such enormities among an order so sacred. The  bishops assumed in many places a princely authority, particularly  those who had the greatest number of churches under their inspection,  and who presided over the most opulent assemblies. They appropriated  to their evangelical function the splendid ensigns of temporal  majesty. A throne, surrounded with ministers, exalted above his equals  the servant of the meek and humble Jesus; and sumptuous garments  dazzled the eyes and the minds of the multitude into an ignorant  veneration of their arrogated authority. The example of the bishops  was ambitiously imitated by the presbyters, who, neglecting the sacred  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#18)"],[1,"to tell his wife  everything that happened, and in this way they avoided any  misunderstanding. \"Well, sir,\" remarked another gentleman present, not  to be outdone in generosity, \"you are not so open and frank as I am, for  I tell my wife a good many things that never happen.\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed a  third, \"I am under no necessity to keep my wife informed regarding my  affairs. She can find out five times as much as I know myself without  the least trouble.\"    \"How,\" said a gentleman to a friend who wished to convey a matter of  importance to a lady without communicating directly with her, \"how can  you be certain of her reading the letter, seeing that you have directed  it to her husband?\" \"That I have managed without the possibility of  failure,\" was the answer; \"she will open it to a certainty, for I have  put the word 'private' in the corner.\"    These anecdotes put in a lively way the well-known fact that it is  impossible for married people to keep secrets the one from the other.  But even to make the attempt is to enter upon ground so dangerous that  scarcely any amount of cautious driving will prevent a catastrophe.  Unless husband and wife trust each other all in all the result will be  much the same as if they trusted not at all.    We believe that the Delilahs are few who would sell their Samsons to the  Philistines when these Samsons have told them the secret source of their  great strength. Still, there are secrets entrusted to the clergyman, the  physician, the lawyer, the legislator to betray which, even to a wife,  would be dishonourable and disgraceful.    A case beautifully illustrating this difficult point in matrimonial  relations occurs in the memoirs of Lady Fanshawe, wife of Sir Richard  Fanshawe, who was a faithful Royalist during the civil war. Soon after  Lady Fanshawe's marriage, she was instigated by some crafty ladies of  the court to obtain from her husband a knowledge of some secret  political events. The matter is best described in her own words: \"And  now I thought myself a perfect queen, and my husband so glorious a  crown, that I more valued myself to be called by his name than born a  princess, for I knew him very wise and very good, and his soul doted on  me; upon which confidence I will tell you what happened. My Lady Rivers,  a brave woman, and one that had suffered many thousand pounds' loss for  the King, and whom I had a great reverence for, and she a kindness for  me as a kinswoman--in discourse she tacitly commended the knowledge of  State affairs, and that some women were very happy in a good  understanding thereof, as my Lady Aubingny, Lady Isabel Thynne, and  divers others, and yet none was at first more capable than I; that in  the night she knew there came a post from Paris from the Queen, and that  she would be extremely glad to hear what the Queen commanded the King  in order to his affairs; saying, if I would ask my husband privately, he  would tell me what he found in the packet, and I might tell her. I that  was young and innocent, and to that day had never in my mouth, what  news?--began to think there was more in inquiring into public affairs  than I thought of, and that it being a fashionable thing, would make me  more beloved of my husband, if that had been possible, than I was. When  my husband returned home from council, after welcoming him, as his  custom ever was, he went with his handful of papers into his study for  an hour or more; I followed him: he turned hastily and said, 'What  would'st thou have, my life?' I told him, 'I heard the Prince had  received a packet from the Queen, and I guessed it was that in his  hands, and I desired to know what was in it.' He smilingly replied, 'My  love, I will immediately come to thee; pray thee go, for I am very  busy.' When he came out of his closet I revived my suit; he kissed me  and talked of other things. At supper, I would eat nothing; he as usual  sat by me, and drank often to me, which was his custom, and was full of  discourse to company that was at table. Going to bed I asked again, and  said I could not believe he loved me, if he refused to tell me all he  knew; but he answered nothing, but stopped my mouth with kisses. So we  went to bed; I cried, and he went to sleep. Next morning early, as his  custom was, he was called to rise, but began to discourse with me first;  to which I made no reply; he rose, came on the other side of the bed and  kissed me, and drew the curtain softly and went to court. When he came  home to dinner, he presently came to me as was usual, and when I had  him by the hand, I said, 'Thou dost not care to see me troubled;' to  which he, taking me in his arms, answered, 'My dearest soul, nothing  upon earth can afflict me like that; and when you asked me of my  business, it was wholly out of my power to satisfy thee, for my life and  fortune shall be thine, and every thought of my heart in which the trust  I am in may not be revealed; but my honour is my own, which I cannot  preserve if I communicate the Prince's affairs; and pray thee with this  answer rest satisfied.' So great was his reason and goodness, that upon  consideration it made my folly appear to me so vile, that from that day  until the day of his death, I never thought fit to ask him any business  but what he communicated freely to me, in order to his estate and  family.\"    When a man comes home tired, hungry, and put out about something that  has gone wrong in business, this is not the time for his wife to order  him to stand and deliver his secret troubles. Rather, she should give  him a well-cooked dinner and say little or nothing. Later on in the  evening, when he is rested and has smoked a pipe of peace, he will be  only too glad to give her his confidence in return for her sympathetic  treatment of him. It seems to me that there is more of vulgar  familiarity than of confidence in a man and wife at all times opening  each other's letters. A sealed letter is sacred; and all persons like to  have the first reading of their own letters. Why should a close  relationship abrogate respectful courtesy?    Artemus Ward tells us that when he was at Salt Lake he was introduced to  Brigham Young's mother-in-law. \"I can't exactly tell you how many there  is of her, but it's a good deal.\" Married people require to drive gently  when there is in the way the stumbling-block of \"a good deal\" of  mother-or other relations-in-law. Certainly Adam and Eve were in  paradise in this respect. \"When I want a nice snug day all to myself,\"  says an ingenuous wife, \"I tell George dear mother is coming, and then I  see nothing of him till one in the morning.\" \"Are your domestic  relations agreeable?\" was the question put to an unhappy-looking  specimen of humanity. \"Oh, my domestic relations are all right; it is my  wife's relations that are causing the trouble.\" It is true we read in  the _Graphic_ a year or two ago an exception to the usual dislike to  mothers-in-law, but the exception was scarcely reassuring. A  well-dressed young woman of nineteen informed a magistrate that her own  mother had run away with her husband. This _mater pulchrior_ came to  stay with her _filia pulchra_, won the affections of the husband, and,  at last, withdrew him from his hearth and home. Still it is the duty of  people to keep on terms of at least friendly neutrality with their  relations-in-law. Where there is disunion there are generally faults on  both sides.    We know of a working-man who on the eve of his marriage signed a promise  to abstain from intoxicating liquor. He put the document into a frame  and presented it to his wife after the wedding as a marriage settlement.  And certainly there cannot be a better marriage settlement than for a  young husband to settle his habits.    The young husband or wife who is in the least degree careless in the use  of intoxicating drinks should read the following account which Mr. Gough  gives of a case which he met in one of the convict prisons of America.  \"I was attracted, while speaking to the prisoners in the chapel, by the  patient, gentle look of one of the convicts who sat before me, whose  whole appearance was that of a mild-tempered, quiet man. After the  service, one of the prison officers, in reply to my question, stated  that this same man was serving out a life term. I asked what was the  possible crime for which he was serving a life term in a State prison.  'Murder.' 'Murder?' 'Yes, he murdered his wife.' Having asked if I might  have an interview with him, my request was granted, and I held a  conversation with him. 'My friend, I do not wish to ask you any  questions that will be annoying; but I was struck by your appearance,  and was so much surprised when I heard of your crime, that I thought I  would like to ask you a question. May I?' 'Certainly, sir.' 'Then why  did you commit the crime? What led you to it?' Then came such a pitiful  story. He said: 'I loved my wife, but I drank to excess. She was a good  woman; she never complained; come home when or how I might, she never  scolded. I think I never heard a sharp word from her. She would  sometimes look at me with such a pitying look that went to my heart;  sometimes it made me tender, and I would cry, and promise to do better;  at other times it would make me angry. I almost wished she would scold  me, rather than look at me with that patient earnestness. I knew I was  breaking her heart; but I was a slave to drink. Though I loved her, I  knew I was killing her. One day I came home drunk, and as I entered the  room I saw her sitting at the table, her face resting on her hand. Oh,  my God! I think I see her now! As I came in she lifted up her face;  there were tears there; but she smiled and said, \"Well, William.\" I  remember just enough to know that I was mad. The devil entered into me.  I rushed into the kitchen, seized my gun, and deliberately shot her as  she sat by that table. I am in prison for life, and have no desire"]]]
