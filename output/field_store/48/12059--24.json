Exploring the same clump of trees in society, perfectly  agreed as to whither their next flitting shall be, no one showing any  disposition to remain when the rest are departing, molesting no one,  and suffering as far as it can be ascertained no persecution, they  furnish a charming example of a happy family. Nomad in their habits,  save that they indulge in no questionable cravings for their  neighbours' property, they satisfy their wants with the natural  produce of any convenient halting-place, when they have exhausted  which they take their flight, in skirmishing order, but generally in a  straight line, and strictly following the lead of their chief, to some  other station; and when overtaken by night, they halt and encamp where  chance has left them. Their only requisite is, in summer, the branch  of a tree; in winter, some sheltered place where they can huddle  together, and sleep until the next day's sun calls them to resume  their erratic course.[6] Their food, during those journeys, consists  of caterpillars, small beetles, and the pupA| of insects generally, and  this diet they seem never or very rarely to vary.[7] The ripest fruits  do not tempt them to prolong their stay in a garden, and insects that  crawl on earth are in two senses beneath their notice. Their rapid  progress from tree to tree has been compared to a flight of arrows.  Singular as is their flight, they are no less amusing while employed  in hunting for food, as they perform all the fantastic vagaries of the  Tits, and their long straight tails add much to the grotesqueness of  their attitudes. Seen near at hand, their appearance may be called  comical. Their abundant loose feathers, the prevailing hue of which is  grey, suggest the idea of old age, and, together with the short hooked  beak, might give a caricaturist a hint of an antiquated human face,  enveloped in grey hair. Many of the provincial names of the bird are  associated with the ridiculous; thus, Long-tailed Mufflin, Long-tail  Mag, Long-tail Pie, Poke-pudding, Hack-muck, Bottle Tom, Mum-ruffin,  and Long-pod, pet names though they are, are also whimsical, and  prepare one beforehand for the information that their owner is 'just a  little eccentric'. But whatever be their name, I never hear the  well-known '_zit, zit_', the pass-word which keeps them together, and  which always accompanies their journeyings, without stopping to watch  the little family on their flight.    The nest of this species is of most exquisite workmanship and  beautiful texture. Its form is that of a large cocoon broadest at the  base, or that of a fir cone. It is sometimes fastened to the stem of a  tree, sometimes placed in a fork, but more frequently built into the  middle of a thick bush, so that it can only be removed by cutting away  the branches to which it is attached. The outer surface is composed  principally of the white lichen which is most abundant in the  neighbourhood, and so is least likely to attract attention. All the  scraps are woven together with threads of fine wool; the dome is  felted together, and made rain-proof by a thick coating of moss and  lichen, wool and the web of spiders' eggs. The walls are of moss. The  interior is a spherical cell, lined with a profusion of feathers. A  softer or warmer bed it would be hard to imagine. At the distance of  about an inch from the top is a circular opening scarcely large enough  to admit one's thumb. In this luxurious couch, which it has cost the  female bird some three weeks of patient industry to complete, she lays  ten or twelve eggs, which all in good time are developed into as many  Bottle Tits; but by what skilful management the ten or twelve long  tails are kept unruffled, and are finally brought to light as straight  as arrows, I can offer no opinion. Nests are occasionally found  containing as many as eighteen eggs. In these cases it has been  affirmed that two or more females share a common nursery, and incubate  together. Certainly it is difficult to imagine how a single pair can  manage to supply with food so many hungry young birds, but there is no  direct evidence of their being two distinct broods.       [6] The name proposed for the Long-tailed Tit, by Dr. Leuch,         _Mecistura vagans_, is most appropriate. \"Long-tailed         Wanderer,\" for such is its import, describes the most         striking outward characteristic of the bird, and its         unvarying habit.       [7] A young friend informed me that he had once shot one, with a         beechnut in its mouth. This it must have picked up from the         ground, as the season was winter.        THE GREAT TIT, OX-EYE OR TOMTIT     PARUS MAJOR        Head, throat, and a line passing down the centre of the      breast, black; back olive-green; cheeks and a spot on the nape      white; breast and abdomen yellow. Length six inches; breadth      nine. Eggs white, speckled with light rusty.    As this bird is no larger than a Sparrow, its surname 'Great' must be  understood to denote only its superiority in size to other birds of  the same family. It is, however, great-hearted, as far as boldness and  bravery entitle it to this epithet, being ready to give battle to  birds far its superiors in size, foremost to join in mobbing an  intrusive Owl, and prepared to defend its nest against robbers of all  kinds. Its powers of locomotion are considerable, as it is strong in  flight, active on the ground, and as a climber is surpassed by few  rivals. Its stout and much-curved hind claw gives it great facility in  clinging to the twigs and branches of trees, sides of ricks, and even  the walls of houses. Such situations it resorts to in quest of its  favourite food, caterpillars and pupA| of all kinds, and it is most  amusing to watch it while thus engaged. Attitude seems to be a matter  of no consequence; it can cling with perfect security to anything but  a smooth surface. On trees it hangs from the branches, with its back  either downwards, or turned sideways, and explores crevices in walls  with as little regard to the vertical position of the surface to which  it clings, as if it were examining a hole in the level ground. Its  efforts to disengage a chrysalis from its cocoon are very  entertaining. One scarcely knows which most to admire, the tenacity of  its grasp, the activity with which it turns its head and body, or the  earnestness and determination with which it clears away every obstacle  until it has secured the prize. It does not, however, limit its food  to insects; it is accused of feeding occasionally on the buds of  fruit-trees, but it is doubtful whether the bird has any other object  in attacking these, than that of hunting out the insects that infest  them. It is said also to be very fond of nuts, which it sticks into  crevices in the bark of trees, and cracks by repeated blows of its  beak. Whether it has this power, I do not know; but that it will _eat_  nuts of every kind, it is easy to prove by fastening the kernels of  filberts or walnuts to the trunks of trees by means of stout pins.  Tits, great and little, and Nuthatches, if there be any in the  neighbourhood, will soon discover them, and if once attracted may thus  be induced to pay daily visits to so productive a garden. A Great Tit  of unusual intelligence, which frequents my garden at the present  time, has been frequently observed to draw up by its claws a walnut  suspended by a string from the bough of an apple-tree, and to rifle  its contents, being itself all the while leisurely perched on the  twig, and keeping the nut firm by a dexterous use of its claws. A  charge, amounting to a grave accusation against the Great Tit, and one  which cannot be palliated by the plea that he has accomplices, is,  that when driven by hunger and he has the opportunity, he attacks  other small and weakly birds, splits their skulls by means of his  strong, sharp beak, and picks out their brains. One story in  particular I find, of a Great Tit having been placed in a well-filled  aviary. In the course of a single night, he had killed every one of  his companions, with the exception of a Quail, and when he was  discovered, he was in the very act of dealing to this the _coup de  grAcce_. His skill and discrimination in pecking holes in the sunniest  side of ripe apples and pears are well known; but to this reward for  his services in destroying caterpillars he is justly entitled.    The Great Tit builds its nest generally in the hole of a tree,  employing as materials moss and leaves, and, for the lining, hair and  feathers; but as its habits lead it to our gardens, it comes into  close contact with human beings and becomes familiar with them. Hence  it occasionally builds its nest in quaint places, which bear ever so  distant a resemblance to its natural haunts. An unused pump affords it  an excellent harbour; and the drawer of an old table, left in an  outhouse, has been found thus occupied.    The notes of the Great Tit are various, but not musical. Its spring  song must be familiar to every one; though not every one who hears it  knows who is the musician. It consists of but two notes, repeated  frequently, and sounding as if made by a bird alternately drawing in  and sending out its breath; both together give a fair imitation of the  sharpening of a saw. Besides this, it indulges in a variety of chirps,  twitters, and cheeps, some angry, some deprecatory, and some pert,  which a practised ear only can refer to their proper author.        THE BLUE TIT, ALSO CALLED TOMTIT     PARUS COERAsLEUS        Crown of the head blue, encircled with white; cheeks white,      bordered with dark blue; back olive-green; wings and tail      bluish; greater coverts and secondaries tipped with white;      breast and abdomen yellow, traversed by a dark blue line.      Length four inches and a half; breadth seven inches and a      half. Eggs as in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#18)"],[1,"enough, only a short while later we had an exactly similar  adventure with a rhino, as owing to the tortuous nature of the path, we  walked right into it before we were aware. Like the lion, however, it  was more frightened than we, and charged away from us through the  jungle.    For about two hours we pursued our journey into the plateau, and saw  and heard a wonderful variety of game, including giraffe, rhino,  bush-buck, the lesser kudu, zebra, wart-hog, baboons and monkeys, and  any number of paa, the last being of a redder colour than those of the  Tsavo valley. Of natives or of human habitations, however, we saw no  signs, and indeed the whole region was so dry and waterless as to be  quite uninhabitable. The animals that require water have to make a  nightly journey to and from the Sabaki, which accounts for the  thousands of animal paths leading from the plateau to the river.    By this time we were all beginning to feel very tired, and the bhisti's  stock of water was running low. I therefore climbed the highest tree I  could find in order to have a good look round, but absolutely nothing  could I see in any direction but the same flat thorny wilderness,  interspersed here and there with a few green trees; not a landmark of  any sort or kind as far as the eye could reach; a most hopeless,  terrible place should one be lost in it, with certain death either by  thirst or by savage beasts staring one in the face. Clearly, then, the  only thing to do was to return to the river; and in order to accomplish  this before dark it was necessary that no time should be lost. But we  had been winding in and out so much through the animal paths that it  was no easy matter to say in which direction the Sabaki lay. First I  consulted my Wa Kamba followers as to the route back, they simply shook  their heads. Then I asked Mahina, who pointed out a direction exactly  opposite to that which I felt confident was the right one. Mabruki, of  course, knew nothing, but volunteered the helpful and cheering  information that we were lost and would all be killed by lions. In  these circumstances, I confirmed my own idea as to our way by comparing  my watch and the sun, and gave the order to start at once. For two  solid hours, however, we trudged along in the fearful heat without  striking a single familiar object or landmark. Mabruki murmured loudly;  even Mahina expressed grave doubts as to whether the \"Sahib\" had taken  the right direction; only the Wa Kamba stalked along in reassuring  silence. For some time we had been following a broad white rhino path,  and the great footmarks, of one of these beasts were fresh and plainly  visible in the dust. He had been travelling in the opposite direction  to us, and I felt sure that he must have been returning from drinking  in the river. I accordingly insisted on our keeping to this path, and  very soon, to my great relief, we found that we were at the edge of the  escarpment, a couple of miles away from the place where we had made the  ascent. Here a halt was called; a sheet was spread over some of the  stunted trees, and under its shade we rested for half an hour, had some  food, and drank the last of our water. After this we pushed on with  renewed vigour, and arrived at the Sabaki in good time before sundown,  having bagged a couple of guinea-fowl and a paa on the way to serve for  dinner. After the long and fatiguing day my bathe in a clear shady pool  was a real delight, but I might not have enjoyed it quite so much if I  had known then of the terrible fate which awaited one of my followers  in the same river the next day. By the time I got back to camp supper  was ready and fully appreciated. The tireless Mahina had also collected  some dry grass for my bed, and I turned in at once, with my rifle  handy, and slept the sleep of the just, regardless of all the wild  beasts in Africa.    At dawn Mabruki roused me with a cup of steaming hot coffee and some  biscuits, and a start was at once made on our return journey to Tsavo.  The place where we had struck the Sabaki the previous evening was some  miles further down the stream than I had ever been before, so I decided  to take advantage of the Masai trail along its bank until the Tsavo  River was reached. I did not think we should meet with any further  adventure on our way home, but in the wilds the unexpected is always  happening. Shortly after we started one of the Wa Kamba went down to  the river's edge to fill his calabash with water, when a crocodile  suddenly rose up out of the stream, seized the poor fellow and in a  moment had dragged him in. I was on ahead at the time and so did not  witness the occurrence, but on hearing the cries of the others I ran  back as quickly as possible--too late, however, to see any sign of  either crocodile or native. Mahina philosophically remarked that after  all it was only a washenzi (savage), whose loss did not much matter;  and the other three Wa Kamba certainly did not appear to be affected by  the incident, but calmly possessed themselves of their dead companion's  bow and quiver of poisoned arrows, and of the stock of meat which he  had left on the bank.    I have since learned that accidents of this kind are of fairly frequent  occurrence along the banks of these rivers. On one occasion while I was  in the country a British officer had a very lucky escape. He was  filling his water bottle at the river, when one of these brutes caught  him by the hand and attempted to draw him in.  Fortunately one of his  servants rushed to his assistance and managed to pull him out of the  crocodile's clutches with the loss only of two of his fingers.    As we made our way up the Sabaki, we discovered a beautiful waterfall  about a hundred and fifty feet high--not a sheer drop, but a series of  cascades. At this time the river was in low water, and the falls  consequently did not look their best; but in flood time they form a  fine sight, and the thunder of the falling water can then be plainly  heard at Tsavo, over seven miles away, when the wind is in the right  direction. We crossed the river on the rocks at the head of these  falls, and after some hours' hard marching reached camp without further  incident.          CHAPTER XIV    THE FINDING OF THE MAN-EATERS' DEN      There were some rocky-looking hills lying to the south-west of Tsavo  which I was particularly anxious to explore, so on one occasion when  work had been stopped for the day owing to lack of material, I set off  for them, accompanied by Mahina and a Punjaubi coolie, who was so stout  that he went by the name of Moota (i.e. \"Fattie\"). In the course of my  little excursions round Tsavo I gradually discovered that I was nearly  always able to make my way to any required point of the compass by  following certain well-defined animal paths, which I mapped out bit by  bit during my explorations. On this occasion, for instance, as soon as  we had crossed the river and had struck into the jungle, we were  fortunate enough to find a rhino path leading in the right direction,  which greatly facilitated our progress. As we were making our way along  this path through the dry bed of a nullah, I happened to notice that  the sandy bottom sparkled here and there where the sunbeams penetrated  the dense foliage. This at once filled my head with thoughts of  precious stones, and as the spot looked likely enough, I started to dig  vigorously at the gravel with my hunting knife. After a few minutes of  this work, I came across what I at first took to be a magnificent  diamond sparkling in the damp sand: it was about half an inch long, and  its facets looked as if they had been cut by an Amsterdam expert. I  tested the stone on my watch glass and found that it cut my initials  quite easily, and though I knew that quartz would do this as well, it  did not seem to me to have either the general appearance or angles of  any quartz I had ever seen. For a moment or two I was greatly delighted  with my discovery, and began to have rosy dreams of a diamond mine; but  I am sorry to say that on closer examination and testing I was forced  to the conclusion that my find was not a diamond, though unlike any  other mineral I had ever come across.    My hopes of rapidly becoming a millionaire having thus been dashed to  the ground, we proceeded on our way, getting further and further into  the depths of a gloomy forest. A little distance on, I noticed through  a break in the trees a huge rhino standing in full view near the edge  of a ravine. Unfortunately he caught sight of us as well, and before I  could take aim, he snorted loudly and crashed off through the tangled  undergrowth. As I followed up this ravine, walking stealthily along in  the delightful shade of the overhanging palms, I observed on my left a  little nullah which opened out of the main channel through a confused  mass of jungle and creeper. Through this tangle there was a  well-defined archway, doubtless made by the regular passage of rhino  and hippo, so I decided to enter and explore what lay beyond. I had not  gone very far when I came upon a big bay scooped out of the bank by the  stream when in flood and carpeted with a deposit of fine, soft sand, in  which were the indistinct tracks of numberless animals. In one corner  of this bay, close under an overhanging tree, stood a little sandy  hillock, and on looking over the top of this I saw on the other side a  fearsome-looking cave which seemed to run back for a considerable  distance under the rocky bank. Round the entrance and inside the cavern  I was thunderstruck to find a number of human bones, with here and  there a copper bangle such as the natives wear. Beyond all doubt, the  man-eaters' den! In this manner, and quite by accident, I stumbled upon  the lair of these once-dreaded \"demons\", which I had spent so many days  searching for through the exasperating and interminable jungle during  the time when they terrorised Tsavo.
