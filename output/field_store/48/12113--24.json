[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#18)"],[1,"\"the gospel of humanity.\" He wrote: \"Italy has been called a graveyard;  but a graveyard peopled by our mighty dead is nearer life than a land  that teems with living weaklings and braggarts;\" he showed Italians \"the  vision of their country, radiant, purified by suffering, moving as an  angel of light among the nations that thought her dead.\" Such words rang  like an inspiration, but Mazzini, studying the men with whom he had to  work, knew that such inspiration was not enough. They struck the note of  glory, but all revolutionists had heard that note; what was needed was  the call to self-sacrifice.    With this fundamental need firmly fixed in his mind Mazzini gave what  spare hours fell to the lot of a young Italian lawyer to the work of  writing to the independent journals. At first he leaned to the side of  caution, realizing how strict was the censorship of the Italian press,  but gradually he contrived to slip bolder and more inflammatory messages  into circulation under the censor's nose. He spoke of a new party that  should arise in a short time, and called it \"Young Italy,\" he expressed  deep sympathy with political exiles, he turned his literary criticisms  into studies of national development. Ultimately one of the papers for  which he wrote, the \"Indicatore Livornese,\" became too daring, and was  ended by the authorities. Mazzini then aimed higher, and gained credit  with the \"Antologia,\" the Edinburgh Review of Italy, by a series of  articles on the historical drama.    Meanwhile he was still studying the problem of giving a new religion  to the youth of Italy. He had joined the Society of the Carbonari, and  was learning that the plots and counter-plots of an unwieldy secret  society would accomplish no good end. There was too much ritual, too  little effort. The Carbonari had no definite plan, they were entirely  at the mercy of any chance leader of disaffection, each member only  knew one or two other members. Of a sudden the Revolution of July in  France fired liberals throughout Europe, Mazzini and his young friends  in Genoa immediately began active preparations for a military uprising.  Lead was being cast into bullets when the police of Genoa intervened and  Mazzini was placed under arrest. He had been suspected of revolutionary  sentiments for some time. The Governor of Genoa told Giuseppe's father  that he considered the son \"was gifted with some talent, and too fond  of walking by himself at night absorbed in thought. What on earth  has he at his age to think about? We don't like young people thinking  without our knowing the subject of their thoughts.\"    Mazzini was taken to the fortress of Savona, and there imprisoned  to await his trial. The commander of the fortress allowed the young  prisoner to keep his Bible, Tacitus, and Byron. From these hours of  solitary confinement sprang the youth's passionate regard for the  English poet, a man whose writings he later vehemently held were only to  be classed with Dante as an inspiration to Italians.    The government could prove nothing definite against him, but he was  thought too dangerous a man to be at large, and so was finally given  his choice between nominal imprisonment in a small town and exile.  France was throbbing with a new democracy, Paris was the center of  revolutionary propaganda, and so Mazzini chose exile there. Early in  1831 he parted from his family at Savona and started north. He felt that  he had come to the parting of the ways, and that henceforth his life  was to be absolutely given to the cause. For the first time he saw the  Alps, and his nature, always strongly susceptible to heroic scenery,  was deeply stirred. He watched the sunrise from Mont Cenis and wrote,  \"The first ray of light trembling on the horizon, vague and pale, like  a timid, uncertain hope, then the long line of fire cutting the blue  heaven, firm and decided as a promise;\" here was the poet soul free at  last to speak its message.    With the date of this first exile begins Mazzini's call to \"Young  Italy.\" He had recognized that his countrymen must waken to a new  religion, that their souls must be touched rather than their ambitions.  The youth of Italy would feel the call more strongly than the  middle-aged. \"Place,\" he said, \"the young at the head of the insurgent  masses; you do not know what strength is latent in those young bands,  what magic influence the voice of the young has on the crowd; you will  find in them a host of apostles for the new religion. But youth lives  on movement, grows great in enthusiasm and faith. Consecrate them with  a lofty mission, inflame them with emulation and praise; spread through  their ranks the word of fire, the word of inspiration; speak to them of  country, of glory, of power, of great memories.\" \"All great national  movements,\" he wrote later, \"begin with the unknown men of the people,  without influence except for the faith and will that counts not time or  difficulties.\" Mazzini was not diffident with regard to his own youthful  powers, nor was Cavour, five years Mazzini's junior, who wrote to a  friend at this time prophesying that he would one morning wake up Prime  Minister of Italy.    The most important feature of \"Young Italy\" was its religion, the  Carbonari had had none. Men were now told that they had a mission given  them by God, and that what had been before a mere personal right had  become a sacred duty. The second feature was the liberation of the poor,  a need which all former revolutionists had seemed to overlook. The  French Revolution had had no such substructure, the poets and dramatists  had idealized national rather than social liberty, but Mazzini saw that  the time had come for a further step, that Austria was not the only  enemy his people had to fear. He wrote, \"I see the people pass before my  eyes in the livery of wretchedness and political subjection, ragged and  hungry, painfully gathering the crumbs that wealth tosses insultingly  to it, or lost and wandering in riot and the intoxication of a brutish,  angry, savage joy; and I remember that these brutalized faces bear the  finger-print of God, the mark of the same mission as my own. I lift  myself to the vision of the future and behold the people rising in its  majesty, brothers in one faith, one bond of equality and love, one ideal  of citizen virtue that ever grows in beauty and might; the people of  the future, unspoilt by luxury, ungoaded by wretchedness, awed by the  consciousness of its rights and duties, and in the presence of that  vision my heart beats with anguish for the present and glorying for  the future.\" Mazzini gave \"Young Italy\" as its watchword \"God and the  People.\"    There can be no question but that \"Young Italy\" was strong where the  Carbonari had been weak, but both movements had of necessity many of  the same defects. Government espionage forced the new movement like  its predecessors to choose the devious courses of a secret society.  The restlessness of the age caused the new movement to take each  fitful start as a momentous signal. The strength of Austria was not  underestimated, but the weakness of the disunited Italian states was.  Diplomacy was disregarded; it was only many years later that Mazzini  the prophet learned the value of Cavour the statesman. \"Young Italy\"  was launched in a troublous sea, destined to encounter many storms, but  fated ultimately to spread abroad the seeds of the hope that was to  awaken republicans throughout all European countries.    Mazzini no sooner arrived in Lyons than he found himself in the center  of plots. The French government, still fresh from the days of July, was  in two minds; first they aided a band of Italian refugees who were  planning a raid into Savoy, then they faced about and scattered the  conspirators. Another plan was for a trip to Corsica, there to gather  arms to aid the insurgents in Romagna, but the funds for this attempt  were lacking. Mazzini gave up immediate action for the moment, and  locating at Marseilles started with a few youthful friends to organize  his great concerted movement. They had nothing but youth and audacity. A  contemporary (probably Enrico Mayer) described Mazzini at this time as  \"about 5 feet 8 inches high, and slightly made; he was dressed in black  Genoa velvet, with a large 'republican' hat; his long, curling black  hair, which fell upon his shoulders, the extreme freshness of his clear  olive complexion, the chiseled delicacy of his regular and beautiful  features, aided by his very youthful look and sweetness and openness of  expression, would have made his appearance almost too feminine, if it  had not been for his noble forehead, the power of firmness and decision  that was mingled with their gaiety and sweetness in the bright flashes  of his dark eyes and in the varying expression of his mouth, together  with his small and beautiful mustachios and beard. Altogether he was  at that time the most beautiful being, male or female, that I had ever  seen, and I have not since seen his equal.\"    Mazzini was proud of these early days when he looked back upon them  later. He wrote, \"We had no office, no helpers. All day, and a great  part of the night, we were buried in our work, writing articles and  letters, getting information from travelers, enlisting seamen, folding  papers, fastening envelopes, dividing our time between literary and  manual work. La Cecilia was compositor; Lamberti corrected the proofs;  another of us made himself literally porter, to save the expense of  distributing papers. We lived as equals and brothers; we had but one  thought, one hope, one ideal to reverence. The foreign republicans loved  and admired us for our tenacity and unflagging industry; we were often  in real want, but we were light-hearted in a way, and smiling because we  believed in the future.\" It was Mazzini's period of boundless hope.    Much of this hope throbbed through the literature that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#18)"],[1,"Carquinez Straits as its location, and  obtained from General Vallejo a title to a league of land, on  condition of building up a city thereon to bear the name of  Vallejo's wife.  This was Francisca Benicia; accordingly, the new  city was named \"Francisca.\"  At this time, the town near the mouth  of the bay was known universally as Yerba Buena; but that name was  not known abroad, although San Francisco was familiar to the whole  civilized world.  Now, some of the chief men of Yerba Buena,  Folsom, Howard, Leidesdorf, and others, knowing the importance of a  name, saw their danger, and, by some action of the ayuntamiento, or  town council, changed the name of Yerba Buena to \"San Francisco.\"  Dr. Semple was outraged at their changing the name to one so like  his of Francisca, and he in turn changed his town to the other name  of Mrs. Vallejo, viz., \"Benicia;\" and Benicia it has remained to  this day.  I am convinced that this little circumstance was big  with consequences.  That Benicia has the best natural site for a  commercial city, I am, satisfied; and had half the money and half  the labor since bestowed upon San Francisco been expended at  Benicia, we should have at this day a city of palaces on the  Carquinez Straits.  The name of \"San Francisco,\" however, fixed the  city where it now is; for every ship in 1848-'49, which cleared  from any part of the world, knew the name of San Francisco, but not  Yerba Buena or Benicia; and, accordingly, ships consigned to  California came pouring in with their contents, and were anchored  in front of Yerba Buena, the first town.  Captains and crews  deserted for the gold-mines, and now half the city in front of  Montgomery Street is built over the hulks thus abandoned.  But Dr.  Semple, at that time, was all there was of Benicia; he was captain  and crew of his ferry boat, and managed to pass our party to the  south side of Carquinez Straits in about two days.    Thence we proceeded up Amador Valley to Alameda Creek, and so on to  the old mission of San Jose; thence to the pueblo of San Jose,  where Folsom and those belonging in Yerba Buena went in that  direction, and we continued on to Monterey, our party all the way  giving official sanction to the news from the gold-mines, and  adding new force to the \"fever.\"    On reaching Monterey, we found dispatches from Commodore Shubrick,  at Mazatlan, which gave almost positive assurance that the war with  Mexico was over; that hostilities had ceased, and commissioners  were arranging the terms of peace at Guadalupe Hidalgo.  It was  well that this news reached California at that critical time; for  so contagious had become the \"gold-fever\" that everybody was  bound to go and try his fortune, and the volunteer regiment of  Stevenson's would have deserted en masse, had the men not been  assured that they would very soon be entitled to an honorable  discharge.    Many of our regulars did desert, among them the very men who had  escorted us faithfully to the mines and back.  Our servants also  left us, and nothing less than three hundred dollars a month would  hire a man in California; Colonel Mason's black boy, Aaron, alone  of all our then servants proving faithful.  We were forced to  resort to all manner of shifts to live.  First, we had a mess with  a black fellow we called Bustamente as cook; but he got the fever,  and had to go.  We next took a soldier, but he deserted, and  carried off my double-barreled shot-gun,  which I prized very  highly.  To meet this condition of facts, Colonel Mason ordered  that liberal furloughs should be given to the soldiers, and  promises to all in turn, and he allowed all the officers to draw  their rations in kind.  As the actual valve of the ration was very  large, this enabled us to live.  Halleck, Murray, Ord, and I,  boarded with Dona Augustias, and turned in our rations as pay for  our board.    Some time in September, 1848, the official news of the treaty of  peace reached us, and the Mexican War was over.  This treaty was  signed in May, and came to us all the way by land by a courier from  Lower California, sent from La Paz by Lieutenant-Colonel Burton.  On its receipt, orders were at once made for the muster-out of all  of Stevenson's regiment, and our military forces were thus reduced  to the single company of dragoons at Los Angeles, and the one  company of artillery at Monterey.  Nearly all business had ceased,  except that connected with gold; and, during that fall, Colonel  Mason, Captain Warner, and I, made another trip up to Sutter's  Fort, going also to the newly-discovered mines on the Stanislaus,  called \"Sonora,\" named from the miners of Sonora, Mexico, who had  first discovered them.  We found there pretty much the same state  of facts as before existed at Mormon Island and Coloma, and we  daily received intelligence of the opening of still other mines  north and south.    But I have passed over a very interesting fact.  As soon as we had  returned from our first visit to the gold-mines, it became  important to send home positive knowledge of this valuable  discovery.  The means of communication with the United States were  very precarious, and I suggested to Colonel Mason that a special  courier ought to be sent; that Second-Lieutenant Loeser had been  promoted to first-lieutenant, and was entitled to go home.  He was  accordingly detailed to carry the news.  I prepared with great care  the letter to the adjutant-general of August 17, 1848, which  Colonel Mason modified in a few Particulars; and, as it was  important to send not only the specimens which had been presented  to us along our route of travel, I advised the colonel to allow  Captain Folsom to purchase and send to Washington a large sample of  the commercial gold in general use, and to pay for the same out of  the money in his hands known as the \"civil fund,\" arising from  duties collected at the several ports in California.  He consented  to this, and Captain Folsom bought an oyster-can full at ten  dollars the ounce, which was the rate of value at which it was then  received at the custom house.  Folsom was instructed further to  contract with some vessel to carry the messenger to South America,  where he could take the English steamers as far east as Jamaica,  with a conditional charter giving increased payment if the vessel  could catch the October steamer.  Folsom chartered the bark La  Lambayecana, owned and navigated by Henry D. Cooke, who has since  been the Governor of the District of Columbia.  In due time this  vessel reached Monterey, and Lieutenant Loeser, with his report and  specimens of gold, embarked and sailed.  He reached the South  American Continent at Payta, Peru, in time; took the English  steamer of October to Panama, and thence went on to Kingston,  Jamaica, where he found a sailing vessel bound for New Orleans.  On  reaching New Orleans, he telegraphed to the War Department his  arrival; but so many delays had occurred that he did not reach  Washington in time to have the matter embraced in the President's  regular message of 1848, as we had calculated.  Still, the  President made it the subject of a special message, and thus became  \"official\" what had before only reached the world in a very  indefinite shape.  Then began that wonderful development, and the  great emigration to California, by land and by sea, of 1849 and  1850.    As before narrated, Mason, Warner, and I, made a second visit to  the mines in September and October, 1848.  As the winter season  approached, Colonel Mason returned to Monterey, and I remained for  a time at Sutter's Fort.  In order to share somewhat in the riches  of the land, we formed a partnership in a store at Coloma, in  charge of Norman S. Bestor, who had been Warner's clerk.  We  supplied the necessary money, fifteen hundred dollars (five hundred  dollars each), and Bestor carried on the store at Coloma for his  share.  Out of this investment, each of us realized a profit of  about fifteen hundred dollars.  Warner also got a regular leave of  absence, and contracted with Captain Sutter for surveying and  locating the town of Sacramento.  He received for this sixteen  dollars per day for his services as surveyor; and Sutter paid all  the hands engaged in the work.  The town was laid off mostly up  about the fort, but a few streets were staked off along the river  bank, and one or two leading to it.  Captain Sutter always  contended, however, that no town could possibly exist on the  immediate bank of the river, because the spring freshets rose over  the bank, and frequently it was necessary to swim a horse to reach  the boat-landing.  Nevertheless, from the very beginning the town  began to be built on the very river-bank, viz., First, Second, and  Third Streets, with J and K Streets leading back.  Among the  principal merchants and traders of that winter, at Sacramento, were  Sam Brannan and Hensley, Reading & Co.  For several years the site  was annually flooded; but the people have persevered in building  the levees, and afterward in raising all the streets, so that  Sacramento is now a fine city, the capital of the State, and stands  where, in 1848, was nothing but a dense mass of bushes, vines, and  submerged land.  The old fort has disappeared altogether.    During the fall of 1848, Warner, Ord, and I, camped on the bank of  the American River, abreast of the fort, at what was known as the  \"Old Tan-Yard.\"  I was cook, Ord cleaned up the dishes, and Warner  looked after the horses; but Ord was deposed as scullion because he  would only wipe the tin plates with a tuft of grass, according to  the custom of the country, whereas Warner insisted on having them  washed after each meal with hot water.  Warner was in consequence  promoted to scullion, and Ord became the hostler.  We drew our  rations in kind from the commissary at San Francisco, who sent them  up to us by a boat; and we were thus enabled to dispense a generous"]]]
