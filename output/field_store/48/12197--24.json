Afterwards this portion  straightens itself, and the cotyledons then free themselves from the  seed-coats. Thus we here have in different parts of the same organ widely  different kinds of movement and of sensitiveness; for the basal part is  geotropic, the upper part apogeotropic, and a portion near the blades  temporarily and spontaneously arches itself. The plumule is not developed  for some little time; and as it rises between the bases of the parallel and  closely approximate petioles of the cotyledons, which in breaking through  the ground have formed an almost open passage, it does not require to be  arched and is consequently always straight. Whether the plumule remains  buried and dormant for a time in its native country, and is thus protected  from the cold of winter, we do not know. The radicle, like that of the  Megarrhiza, grows into a tuber-like mass, which ultimately attains a great  size. So it is with Ipomoea pandurata, the germination of which, as Asa  Gray informs us, resembles that of I. leptophylla.    The following case is interesting in connection with  [page 85]  the root-like nature of the petioles. The radicle of a seedling was cut  off, as it was completely decayed, and the two now separated cotyledons  were planted. They emitted roots from their bases, and continued green and  healthy for two months. The blades of both then withered, and on removing  the earth the bases of the petioles (instead of the radicle) were found  enlarged into little tubers. Whether these would have had the power of  producing two independent plants in the following summer, we do not know.    In Quercus virens, according to Dr. Engelmann,* both the cotyledons and  their petioles are confluent. The latter grow to a length \"of an inch or  even more;\" and, if we understand rightly, penetrate the ground, so that  they must be geotropic. The nutriment within the cotyledons is then quickly  transferred to the hypocotyl or radicle, which thus becomes developed into  a fusiform tuber. The fact of tubers being formed by the foregoing three  widely distinct plants, makes us believe that their protection from animals  at an early age and whilst tender, is one at least of the advantages gained  by the remarkable elongation of the petioles of the cotyledons, together  with their power of penetrating the ground like roots under the guidance of  geotropism.    The following cases may be here given, as they bear on our present subject,  though not relating to seedlings. The flower-stem of the parasitic Lathraea  squamaria, which is destitute of true leaves, breaks through the ground as  an arch;** so does the flower-    * 'Transact. St. Louis Acad. Science,' vol. iv. p. 190.    ** The passage of the flower-stem of the Lathraea through the ground cannot  fail to be greatly facilitated by the extraordinary quantity of water  secreted at this period of the year by the subter-  [[page 86]]  ranean scale-like leaves; not that there is any reason to suppose that the  secretion is a special adaptation for this purpose: it probably follows  from the great quantity of sap absorbed in the early spring by the  parasitic roots. After a long period without any rain, the earth had become  light-coloured and very dry, but it was dark-coloured and damp, even in  parts quite wet, for a distance of at least six inches all round each  flower-stem. The water is secreted by glands (described by Cohn, 'Bericht.  Bot. Sect. der Schlesischen Gesell.,' 1876, p. 113) which line the  longitudinal channels running through each scale-like leaf. A large plant  was dug up, washed so as to remove the earth, left for some time to drain,  and then placed in the evening on a dry glass-plate, covered with a  bell-glass, and by next morning it had secreted a large pool of water. The  plate was wiped dry, and in the course of the succeeding 7 or 8 hours  another little pool was secreted, and after 16 additional hours several  large drops. A smaller plant was washed and placed in a large jar, which  was left inclined for an hour, by which time no more water drained off. The  jar was then placed upright and closed: after 23 hours two drachms of water  were collected from the bottom, and a little more after 25 additional  hours. The flower-stems were now cut off, for they do not secrete, and the  subterranean part of the plant was found to weigh 106.8 grams (1611  grains), and the water secreted during the 48 hours weighed 11.9 grams (183  grains),--that is, one-ninth of the whole weight of the plant, excluding  the flower-stems. We should remember that plants in a state of nature would  probably secrete in 48 hours much more than the above large amount, for  their roots would continue all the time absorbing sap from the plant on  which they were parasitic.  [page 86]    stem of the parasitic and leafless Monotropa hypopitys. With Helleborus  niger, the flower-stems, which rise up independently of the leaves,  likewise break through the ground as arches. This is also the case with the  greatly elongated flower-stems, as well as with the petioles of Epimedium  pinnatum. So it is with the petioles of Ranunculus ficaria, when they have  to break through the ground, but when they arise from the summit of the  bulb above ground, they are from the first quite straight; and this is a  fact which deserves notice. The rachis of the bracken fern (Pteris  aquilina), and of some, probably many, other ferns, likewise rises above  ground under the form of an arch. No doubt other analogous instances could  be found by careful search. In all ordinary cases of bulbs, rhizomes,  [page 87]  root-stocks, etc., buried beneath the ground, the surface is broken by a  cone formed by the young imbricated leaves, the combined growth of which  gives them force sufficient for the purpose.    With germinating monocotyledonous seeds, of which, however, we did not  observe a large number, the plumules, for instance, those of Asparagus and  Canna, are straight whilst breaking through the ground. With the Gramineae,  the sheath-like cotyledons are likewise straight; they, however, terminate  in a sharp crest, which is white and somewhat indurated; and this structure  obviously facilitates their emergence from the soil: the first true leaves  escape from the sheath through a slit beneath the chisel-like apex and at  right angles to it. In the case of the onion (Allium cepa) we again meet  with an arch; the leaf-like cotyledon being abruptly bowed, when it breaks  through the ground, with the apex still enclosed within the seed-coats. The  crown of the arch, as previously described, is developed into a white  conical protuberance, which we may safely believe to be a special  adaptation for this office.    The fact of so many organs of different kinds--hypocotyls and epicotyls,  the petioles of some cotyledons and of some first leaves, the cotyledons of  the onion, the rachis of some ferns, and some flower-stems--being all  arched whilst they break through the ground, shows how just are Dr.  Haberlandt's* remarks on the importance of the arch to seedling plants. He  attributes its chief importance to the upper, young, and more tender parts  of the hypocotyl    * 'Die Schutzeinrichtungen in der Entwickelung der Keimpflanze,' 1877. We  have learned much from this interesting essay, though our observations lead  us to differ on some points from the author.  [page 88]    or epicotyl, being thus saved from abrasion and pressure whilst breaking  through the ground. But we think that some importance may be attributed to  the increased force gained by the hypocotyl, epicotyl, or other organ by  being at first arched; for both legs of the arch increase in length, and  both have points of resistance as long as the tip remains enclosed within  the seed-coats; and thus the crown of the arch is pushed up through the  earth with twice as much force as that which a straight hypocotyl, etc.,  could exert. As soon, however, as the upper end has freed itself, all the  work has to be done by the basal leg. In the case of the epicotyl of the  common bean, the basal leg (the apex having freed itself from the  seed-coats) grew upwards with a force sufficient to lift a thin plate of  zinc, loaded with 12 ounces. Two more ounces were added, and the 14 ounces  were lifted up to a very little height, and then the epicotyl yielded and  bent to one side.    With respect to the primary cause of the arching process, we long thought  in the case of many seedlings that this might be attributed to the manner  in which the hypocotyl or epicotyl was packed and curved within the  seed-coats; and that the arched shape thus acquired was merely retained  until the parts in question reached the surface of the ground. But it is  doubtful whether this is the whole of the truth in any case. For instance,  with the common bean, the epicotyl or plumule is bowed into an arch whilst  breaking through the seed-coats, as shown in Fig. 59 (p. 92). The plumule  first protrudes as a solid knob (e in A), which after twenty-four hours'  growth is seen (e in B) to be the crown of an arch. Nevertheless, with  several beans which germinated in damp air, and had otherwise been treated  in an unnatural manner, little  [page 89]  plumules were developed in the axils of the petioles of both cotyledons,  and these were as perfectly arched as the normal plumule; yet they had not  been subjected to any confinement or pressure, for the seed-coats were  completely ruptured, and they grew in the open air. This proves that the  plumule has an innate or spontaneous tendency to arch itself.    In some other cases the hypocotyl or epicotyl protrudes from the seed at  first only slightly bowed; but the bowing afterwards increases  independently of any constraint. The arch is thus made narrow, with the two  legs, which are sometimes much elongated, parallel and close together, and  thus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Midway (#18)"],[1,"die, and I said  horribly cruel things to her.\"    \"Who--Mrs. Chatterton?\" said the boy, opening his dark eyes; \"why, you  couldn't have said cruel things to her, Polly. Don't be foolish,  child.\" He spoke as he would to Phronsie's terror, and smiled into her  face. But it did not reassure Polly.    \"Jasper, you don't know; you can't guess what dreadful things I said,\"  cried poor overwhelmed Polly, clasping her hands tightly together at  the mere thought of the words she had uttered.    \"Then she must have said dreadful things to you,\" said the boy.    \"She--but, oh, Jasper! that doesn't make it any better for me,\" said  Polly. \"Don't stop me; I am going to see if they won't let me do  something for her.\"    \"There are ever so many people up there now,\" said Jasper. \"Your  mother, and Hortense, and two or three maids. What in the world could  you do, Polly? Come down into the library, and tell us all about it.\"    But Polly broke away from him with an \"Oh! I must do something for  her,\" speeding on until she softly worked her way into the sick room.    Mrs. Pepper was busy with the doctor in the further part of the room,  and Polly stood quite still for a moment, wishing she were one of the  maids, to whom a bit of active service was given. She could not longer  endure her thoughts in silence, and gently going up to her mother's  side, with a timorous glance at the bed, as she passed it, she begged,  \"Mamsie, can't I do something for her?\"    Mrs. Pepper glanced up quickly. \"No--yes, you can; take this  prescription down to Oakley's to be prepared.\"    Polly seized the bit of paper from Dr. Valentine's hand, and hurried  out. Again she glanced fearfully at the bed, but the curtain on that  side was drawn so that only the outline of the figure could be seen.  She was soon out on the street, the movement through the fresh air  bringing back a little color to her cheek and courage to her heart.  Things did not seem quite so bad if she only might do something for the  poor sick woman that could atone for the wretched work she had done; at  least it would be some comfort if the invalid could be helped by her  service.    Thus revolving everything in her mind, Polly did not hear her name  called, nor rapid footsteps hurrying after.    \"Wait!\" at last cried a voice; \"O, dear me! what is the matter, Polly?\"  Alexia Rhys drew herself up flushed and panting at Polly's side.    \"I'm on the way to the apothecary's,\" said Polly, without looking  around.    \"So I should suppose,\" said Alexia; \"O, dear! I'm so hot and tired. Do  go a bit slower, Polly.\"    \"I can't,\" said Polly. \"She's very sick, and I must get this just as  soon as I can.\" She waved the prescription at her, and redoubled her  speed.    \"Who?\" gasped Alexia, stumbling after as best she could.    \"Mrs. Chatterton,\" said Polly, a lump in her throat as she uttered the  name.    \"O, dear me! that old thing,\" cried Alexia, her enthusiasm over the  errand gone.    \"Hush!\" said Polly hoarsely; \"she may die. She has had bad news.\"    \"What?\" asked Alexia; the uncomfortable walk might be enlivened by a  bit of stray gossip; \"what is it, Polly? What news?\"    \"A telegram,\" said Polly. \"Her favorite nephew was drowned at sea.\"    \"Oh! I didn't know she had any favorite nephew. Doesn't she fight with  everybody?\"    \"Do be quiet,\" begged Polly. \"No; that is, perhaps, other people are  not kind to her.\"    \"Oh!\" said Alexia, in a surprised voice. \"Well, I think she's perfectly  and all-through-and-through horrid, so! Don't race like this through  the streets, Polly. You'll get there soon enough.\"    But Polly turned a deaf ear, and at last the prescription was handed  over the counter at Oakley's, and after what seemed an endless time to  Polly, the medicine was given to her.    \"Now as soon as you carry that thing home,\" observed Alexia, glancing  at the white parcel in Polly's hand, \"I hope you'll come with us girls.  That's what I ran after you for.\"    \"What girls?\" asked Polly.    \"Why, Philena and the Cornwalls; we are going to have a sleighing party  to-night, and a supper at Lilly Drexell's. Mrs. Cornwall chaperones the  thing.\"    Polly was surprised to feel her heart bound. It hadn't seemed as if it  could ever be moved by any news of girlish frolics, but that its dull  ache must go on forever.    \"Oh! I can't,\" she cried the next moment. \"I must stay at home, and  help take care of Mrs. Chatterton.\"    \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Alexia in a provoked tone; \"you are not wanted  there, Polly Pepper; the idea, with that great house full of servants.\"    \"Well, I shall not go,\" declared Polly sharply; \"you needn't ask me,  Alexia. I shall stay home till she gets well.\"    \"You little idiot!\" cried Alexia, thoroughly out of temper. But as this  produced no effect on Polly, she began to wheedle and coax. \"Now,  Polly, do be reasonable. You know we can't go without you; you wouldn't  spoil the whole thing; you know you wouldn't. I shall just tell the  Cornwalls that you are coming,\" and she turned off to the corner of the  avenue.    \"Indeed you will not,\" called Polly after her. \"Don't you dare do that,  Alexia Rhys,\" she said, with flashing eyes.    \"You are the most uncomfortable girl I ever saw,\" cried Alexia,  stopping, to come slowly back. \"You spoil every bit of fun with your  absurd notions. I'm quite, quite put out with you, Polly.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said poor Polly, fairly longing for the snow-revel, and  dismayed at disappointing the girls.    \"No, you're not,\" pouted Alexia, \"and I shall tell them all so,\" and  she broke away and ran off in the opposite direction.    Polly was met at the door by Mrs. Pepper, who grasped the packet of  medicine quickly.    \"Isn't there anything else I can do, Mamsie?\" begged Polly.    \"No; sit down and rest; you're hot and tired, you've run so.\"    \"I'm not tired,\" said Polly, not daring to ask \"Is she better?\"    \"Well, you must be,\" said Mrs. Pepper, hurrying off, \"going all the way  down to Oakley's.\"    So Polly had nothing to do but to sit out in the hall, and listen and  watch all the movements in the sick room, every one of which but  increased her terror. At least she could bear it no longer, and as Dr.  Valentine came out, putting on his gloves, she rushed after him.    \"Oh! will she die?\" she begged; \"please do tell me, sir?\"    \"Die? no indeed, I hope not,\" said Dr. Valentine. \"She has had a severe  shock to her nerves and her age is against her, but she is coming  around all right, I trust. Why, Polly, I thought better things of you,  my girl.\" He glanced down into the distressed face with professional  disfavor.    \"I'm so glad she won't die,\" breathed Polly, wholly lost to his opinion  of her; and her face gleamed with something of her old brightness.    \"I didn't know you were so fond of her,\" observed Dr. Valentine grimly;  \"indeed, to speak truthfully, I have yet to learn that anybody is fond  of her, Polly.\"    \"Now if you really want to help her,\" he continued thoughtfully,  pulling his beard, as Polly did not answer, \"I can give you one or two  hints that might be of use.\"    \"Oh! I do, I do,\" cried Polly with eagerness.    \"It will be tiresome work,\" said Dr. Valentine, \"but it will be a piece  of real charity, and perhaps, Polly, it's as well for you to begin now  as to wait till you can belong to forty charity clubs, and spend your  time going to committee meetings.\" And he laughed not altogether  pleasantly. How was Polly to know that Mrs. Valentine was immersed up  to her ears in a philanthropic sea with the smallest possible thought  for the doctor's home? \"Now that maid,\" said the physician, dropping  his tone to a confidential one, \"is as well as the average, but she's  not the one who is to amuse the old lady. It's that she needs more than  medicine, Polly. She actually requires diversion.\"    Poor Polly stood as if turned to stone. Diversion! And she had thrown  away all chance of that.    \"She is suffering for the companionship of some bright young nature,\"  Dr. Valentine proceeded, attributing the dismay written all over the  girl's face to natural unwillingness to do the service. \"After she gets  over this attack she needs to be read to for one thing; to be told the  news; to be made to forget herself. But of course, Polly,\" he said  hastily, buttoning his top coat, and opening the outer door, \"it's too  much to ask of you; so think no more about it, child.\"          XII    NEW WORK FOR POLLY      It was Saturday morning, and Polly ran upstairs with a bright face, the  morning Journal in her hand. \"I'm going to stay with Mrs. Chatterton,  Hortense,\" she announced to that functionary in the dressing-room.    \"And a comfairte may it gif to you,\" said Hortense, with a vicious  shake of the silk wrapper in her hand, before hanging it in its place.  \"Madame has the tres diablerie, cross as de two steeks, what you call  it, dis morning.\"    Polly went softly into the room, closing the door gently after her. In  the shadow of one corner of the large apartment, sat Mrs. Chatterton  under many wrappings in the depths of an invalid's chair. Polly went up  to her side.    \"Would you like to have me read the news, Mrs. Chatterton?\" she asked  gently.    Mrs. Chatterton turned her head and looked at her. \"No,\" she was about  to say shortly, just as she had repulsed many little offers of Polly's  for the past few days; but somehow this morning the crackling of the  fresh sheet in the girl's hand, suggestive of crisp bits of gossip, was  too much for her to hear indifferently, especially as she was in a  worse state of mind than usual over Hortense and her bad temper.    \"You may sit down and read a little, if you like,\" she said  ungraciously. So Polly, happy as a queen at the permission, slipped  into a convenient chair, and began at once. She happened fortunately on  just the right things for the hungry ears; a description of a large  church wedding, the day before; two or three bits about society people "]]]
