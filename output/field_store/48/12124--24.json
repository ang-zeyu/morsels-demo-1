To attend this school I had to travel on foot, and  sometimes with bare feet at that, about six miles. This I did once  a week, besides visiting and preaching in five or six branches a  week.    While thus engaged, and in answer to our correspondence with the  Prophet, Joseph Smith, at Kirtland, Ohio, the following revelation  was sent to us by him, dated August, 1833:    \"Verily I say unto you, my friends, I speak unto you with my  voice, even the voice of my Spirit; that I may show unto you my  will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion; many of whom are  truly humble, and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to  find truth; verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such for  they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, showeth mercy unto all the  meek, and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be justified when  I shall bring them into judgment.    \"Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I the  Lord am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion; and  also with my servant, Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me; and  inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me, he shall continue to  preside over the school in the land of Zion until I shall give unto  him other commandments; and I will bless him with a multiplicity of  blessings in expounding all Scriptures and mysteries to the  edification of the school and of the Church in Zion, and to the  residue of the school I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy;  nevertheless, there are those that must needs be chastened, and  their works shall be made known. The axe is laid at the root of the  trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be  hewn down and cast into the fire; I, the Lord have spoken it.  Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are  honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing  to observe their covenants by sacrifice; yea, every sacrifice which  I, the Lord, shall command, they are all accepted of me, for I, the  Lord will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which  is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream that yieldeth much  precious fruit.    \"Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that an house should  be built unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the pattern which I  have given you; yea, let it be built speedily by the tithing of my  people; behold, this is the tithing and the sacrifice which I, the  Lord, require at their hands; that there may be an house built unto  me for the salvation of Zion, for a place of thanksgiving for all  saints, and for a place of instruction for all those who are called  to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and  offices, that they may be perfected in the understanding of their  ministry in theory, in principle, and in doctrine in all things  pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth, the keys of which  kingdom have been conferred upon you.    \"And inasmuch as my people build an house unto me in the name of  the Lord, and do nor suffer any unclean thing to come into it that  it be not defiled, My glory shall rest upon it; yea, and my  presence shall be there; for I will come into it, and all the pure  in heart that shall come into it shall see God; but if it be  defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be there  for I will not come into unholy temples.    \"And now behold, if Zion do these things she shall prosper and  spread herself and become very glorious, very great, and very  terrible; and the nations of the earth shall honor her and shall  say, surely Zion is the city of our God; and surely Zion cannot  fall, neither be moved out of her place; for God is there, and the  hand of the Lord is there, and He hath sworn by the power of His  might to be her salvation and her high tower; therefore, verily  thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion, THE PURE  IN HEART; therefore let Zion rejoice while all the wicked shall  mourn; for behold, and lo! vengeance cometh speedily upon the  ungodly as the whirlwind, and who shall escape it? The Lord's  scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof  shall vex all people; yet it shall not be stayed until the Lord  come; for the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their  abominations and all their wicked works; nevertheless, Zion shall  escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded  her; but if she observes not to do whatsoever I have commanded her,  I will visit her, according to all her works, with sore affliction;  with pestilence; with plague; with sword; with vengeance; with  devouring fire; nevertheless, let it be read this once in their  ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of their offering; and if she  sin no more none of these things shall come upon her, and I will  bless her with blessings, and multiply a multiplicity of blessings  upon her and upon her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord  your God. Amen.\"    This revelation was not complied with by the leaders and Church  in Missouri, as a whole; notwithstanding many were humble and  faithful. Therefore, the threatened judgment was poured out to the  uttermost, as the history of the five following years will show.    That portion of the inhabitants of Jackson County which did not  belong to the Church, became jealous of our growing influence and  numbers. Political demagogues were afraid we should rule the  county; and religious priests and bigots felt that we were powerful  rivals, and about to excel all other societies in the State in  numbers, and in power and influence.    These feelings, and the false statements and influences growing  out of them, gave rise to the organization of a company of outlaws,  whose avowed object was to drive the Church of the Saints from the  county.    These were composed of lawyers, magistrates, county officers,  civil and military; religious ministers, and great numbers of the  ignorant and uninformed portion of the population, whose prejudices  were easily aroused.    They commenced operations by assembling in great numbers,  destroying a printing office and its materials; demolishing  dwellings and stores, and plundering the contents and strewing them  in the street; cutting open feather beds, breaking furniture,  destroying fences and crops, whipping, threatening and variously  abusing men, women and children, etc.    The saints submitted to these outrages for a time in all  patience, without defence or resistance of any kind, supposing that  the public authorities would of course put a stop to them, as in  duty bound.    But they were soon convinced to the contrary, and were compelled  to take up arms for defence; and also to make the most vigorous  exertions to prosecute according to law. We assembled in small  bodies in different neighborhoods, and stood on guard during the  nights, being ready to march in a moment to any place of attack.    I had the command of about sixty men who were thus assembled in  the Colesville branch; and rendezvoused in some log buildings  during a very rainy time.    It was evening. I was out in the act of posting guards a short  distance from the dwellings, when two men assailed us, armed with  guns and pistols; and supposing it against our principles to make  any defence, they attacked the guards. I was without arms, but  stepped forward to interfere between them, when one of them drew  his gun backwards, and, with both hands, struck the barrel of it  across the top of my head. I staggered back, but did not fall; the  blood came streaming down my face, and I was for an instant stunned  by the blow; but, recovering myself, I called help from the house  and disarmed them, and put them under guard till morning. Their  arms were then restored, and they let go in peace.    The taking of these two men proved a Preventive against an  attack that night. They were the advance of a party of men who were  about to come upon the settlement, but were disconcerted by this  means.    On the next day, about sunset, myself and a Mr. Marsh set out on  horseback to visit the Circuit Judge at Lexington, a distance of  some forty miles. We were under the necessity of travelling the  most private paths across the country, in order to avoid our  enemies; but we had a most faithful pilot, an old resident of the  country, who knew every crook and turn of the different paths.    We had ridden but a few miles when it became so excessively dark  that we could not see each other, or distinguish any object. Our  pilot dismounted several times and tried to feel his way. We were  at last compelled to halt for some time, until it cleared and  became a little lighter; but the rain began to fall in torrents,  and continued all the latter part of the night. We soon became  drenched, and every thread about us perfectly wet; but still we  dare not stop for any refreshment or shelter, until day dawned,  when we found ourselves forty miles from home and at the door of a  friend, where we breakfasted and refreshed ourselves.    We then repaired to Lexington, and made oath before Judge Ryland  of the outrages committed upon us, but were refused a warrant. The  Judge advised us to fight and kill the outlaws whenever they came  upon us. We then returned to the place where we breakfasted, and,  night coming on, we retired to bed. Having been without sleep for  the three previous nights, and much of the time drenched with rain,  this, together with the severe wound I had received, caused me to  feel much exhausted. No sooner had sleep enfolded me in her kind  embrace than a vision opened before me.    I was in Jackson County; heard the sound of firearms and saw the  killed and wounded lying in their blood. At this I awoke from  slumber, and awaking Mr. Marsh and the family with whom we lodged,  I told them that I had seen and heard in my dream, and that I was  sure a battle had just occurred.    Next morning we pursued our journey homeward with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#18)"],[1,"it  enough.  I am always fidgety, always nervous.  My hands and feet  are always going.  Whenever I would see a boy it would always  come up in front of my eyes.  It was mostly when I saw boys.  If  she had explained it more it would not have come up that way.  I  know a girl who does that thing.  She's bad.  She does it with  boys too.  The people said so.  When I was little I imagined  there were some bad girls.  You can't tell, but you can guess a  little.  That boy had lots of things.  I don't know if he took  anything.  It was when I was about 4 until I was 8 that I played  with him.  These things never came up in my mind when I was  taking things.  It was only when I was not busy.  I was always  thinking about it when I haven't anything else to do.  These few  little words were not enough to explain.  I remember I asked my  aunt once.  I tried to put things together what I heard, and what  words about it meant.''    The above excerpts from many interviews with this girl represent  points upon which there is the least contradiction.  It is  obviously useless to give any more of her story because of the  variation from time to time.  Even on the last occasion when we  talked earnestly to her before she was taken to her new home, she  lied to us about a number of points.  Any attempt at an accurate  analysis of her impulse to steal seemed quite beyond the mark in  the light of her ever-ready fabrications.    The after-history of this case is of the utmost importance.  A  woman of strong character took Edna and surrounded her with new  interests.  Conference was had with us on the nature of the case.  For the next few months reports came that the girl was a liar  through and through and grave doubts were entertained of ultimate  success.  It was after she had been tried in her new environment  for 3 months that, seeing us again, she confessed that her  stories about her foster father were absolutely untrue.  From  about this time on there has been steady improvement.  No more  elaborate fabrications have been indulged in.  On several  occasions when Edna has been late from school she has lied about  it, but even that tendency for the last year has been nearly  obliterated.  A good deal of interest in boys has been  maintained, but not with any show of immorality.  There has been  nothing but normal flirting; accounting for the occasions when  Edna has been late from school.    At two or three periods during her new life Edna has engaged in  stealing.  She has taken articles for which she had no particular  use and has told lies about the matter.  The thieving has not  been a single event, but each time has seemed to represent a  state of mind she has been in, and for a week or so numerous  articles have been taken.  We warned her good friend to make a  study of her social and mental influences at such periods.  It  was found then that Edna was undergoing special stress on at  least one such occasion.  A young man had been making up to her,  and later she confided that this given period was one of great  turmoil because of the renewed arousal of many ideas about sex  affairs.  After this there was still more attempts to win Edna's  confidence about her daily experiences, including such as the  above.  There has been the gradual development of character, and  Edna is now, two years after she was taken from her bad  environment, only very occasionally guilty of falsifying, and she  is otherwise trustworthy.    Our study of the causative factors of this girl's delinquency and  particularly of her extraordinary lying led us to see that  perhaps all of the following have a part:  (a) Heredity.  Father  unknown.  Mother a free-living woman.  (b) Home conditions.  Mental and moral bad influences in the home life on account of  the foster mother conniving at stealing and being herself an  extreme liar.  (c) Psychic contagion from the atmosphere of lies  in which the girl has been brought up.  (d) Mental conflict  arising from the suspicion of her parentage, early acquaintance  with sex knowledge, and the irregular morale of her home life.  (e) Bad companions, including her foster mother's friends, and  boys and girls.    ---------------------------------------------------------------  Mental Conflict.

The facts  were known to only three or four people and she was terribly  worried about it all.  Upon her information the affair was taken  up by a group of professional men, one of them a lawyer of large  practical experience.  She aided in an investigation which  attempted to uncover the ``white slave'' feature of the case.  The data of verification proved most elusive.  Later, the young  woman implicated herself in a burglary, and altogether an  elaborate story of her life was evolved.  It was found that from  early years she had been a great fabricator.      While a first year student at a university Marie M. begged for an  interview with one of her instructors at his home and there, with  him and others, she told a detailed story of how some months  previously she had escaped a difficult situation by killing a  man.    The exceedingly long account which was given at intervals to  several professional men and enlarged upon in response to  inquiry, or as the occasion otherwise demanded, we are not  justified in taking space to retell.  This case figures, as a  whole, in somewhat anecdotal fashion among our others, we freely  confess; it is cited to show the extent to which apparently  purposeless fabrication can go.  It has been found impossible to  gain a satisfactory idea of the genesis of this young woman's  tendency, quite in contrast to the other cases we have cited.  It  forms the only instance where we have drawn from our experience  with merely partially studied cases.    Marie's story involved many items of her life since she was about  12 years of age.  A distant relative who had come to know her  whereabouts (she was an orphan living with friends) figured  extensively in her narrative.  This relative had hounded her in  an effort to get her to engage in an evil life.  His attentions  varied greatly; sometimes for months she was not bothered with  him.  Once when she was on her way to Milwaukee a gray haired man  approached her on the train, said he knew her relatives, they  were rather a bad lot of people, and he wanted to protect her  from them.  Then came a long account of being driven in a  carriage, changing her clothes in a hotel, having her picture  taken in an immodest costume, signing a paper at police  headquarters, and, at last, safely returning home, all guided by  the mysterious gray haired man.  Another trip led to an encounter  with a man who took her in an automobile under the promise of  meeting a friend.  Entering a building where men carried  revolvers and girls were given hypodermic injections, just as she  was about to receive the needle in her arm, she reached the man's  revolver and shot him in the back.  Events follow swiftly in her  tale, but all is thoroughly coherent, and a number of facts are  included which could be substantiated.  The professional men  could not help being impressed and spent much valuable time  before they felt convinced that it was a fabrication.  The exact  locations could not be discovered, but then Marie was a stranger  in the city.    When we saw her the whole story was reiterated with but few  changes, which, however, from the standpoint of testimony were  most important.  We soon found we could get direct testimony on  physical features which were provably untrue.  For instance, the  description of a certain hallway in a building where she had gone  with one of the men interested in the events was totally unlike  anything that existed there.  Then, too, certain embellishments,  which by this time included the payment of a large check to her  as hush money, a check which she as easily gave away again,  seemed altogether improbable.  Marie by this time was implicating  herself in a burglary with this relative, and some other curious  incidents were given.  In all of these, as we later found, there  was a central event about which her statements MIGHT have been  true.  There was such a burglary; she had said in previous years  that she was hounded by a man, and so on.  We, too, were struck  by the uselessness and lack of purpose in the lying--for we soon  felt assured that it was such.    Physically we found Marie to be a decidedly good specimen.  She  weighed about 140 lbs.  Strong and firm in carriage.  Vivacious  in expression.  The physical examination at the university had  shown her to be without notable defect of any kind.  We can  summarize Marie's characteristics by stating that from the  earliest age of which we can get satisfactory record, when she  was about 10 years old, she has been persistently addicted to  falsehoods.  Even then she made up, without any basis, stories  which puzzled many people.  It is much to the point that she has  been a great loser on account of this tendency; it has injured  her reputation on numerous occasions and destroyed many of her  good chances.  When she was about 15 it was noticed that she was  a great day-dreamer.  She thought she could write stories and  once began a novel.  Much more peculiar than this was the fact  that she repeatedly wrote letters to her"]]]
