The porpoise raised in sport  his dark, glistening back to the light of day, and plunged into  the cool depths as if playing off the \"amate sponde\" of the  Mediterranean; and sandpipers and curlews, the latter wild as  ever, paced the smooth, pure floor. The shoreline was backed by a  dark vegetable wall, here and there broken and fronted by single  trees, white mangroves tightly corded down, and raised on stilted  roots high above the tide. Between wood and wave lay powdered  sandstone of lively yellow, mixed with bright white quartz and  débris of pink shells. Upon the classic shores of Greece I should  have thought of Poseidon and the Nereids; but the lovely scene  was in unromantic Africa, which breeds no such visions of         \"The fair humanities of old religion.\"    Resuming our road, we passed the ruins of an \"Olako,\" the khámbí  of East Africa, a temporary encampment, whose few poles were  still standing under a shady tree. We then came upon a blockaded  lagoon; the sea-water had been imprisoned by a high bank which  the waves had washed up, and it will presently be released by  storms from the south-west. Near the water, even at half-ebb, we  find the floor firm and pleasant; it becomes loose walking at  high tide, and the ribbed banks are fatiguing to ascend and  descend under a hot sun and in reeking air. A seine would have  supplied a man-of-war in a few hours; large turtle is often  turned; in places young ones about the size of a dollar scuttled  towards the sea, and Hotaloya brought a nest of eggs, which,  however, were too high in flavour for the European palate. The  host of crabs lining the water stood alert, watching our  approach, and when we came within a hundred yards they hurried  sideways into the safer sea--the scene reminded me of the days  when, after \"tiffin,\" we used to \"már kankrás\" on the Clifton  Sands in the Unhappy Valley.    Presently we came to a remarkable feature of this coast, the  first specimen of which was seen at Point Ovindo in the Gaboon  River. The Iberian explorers called them \"Sernas,\" fields or  downs, opposed to Corôas, sand-dunes or hills. They are clearings  in the jungle made by Nature's hand, fenced round everywhere,  save on the sea side, by tall walls of dark vegetation.;  averaging perhaps a mile long by 200 yards broad, and broken by  mounds and terraces regular as if worked by art. These prairies  bear a green sward, seldom taller than three feet, and now ready  for the fire,--here and there the verdure is dotted by a tree or  two. It is universally asserted that they cannot be cultivated;  and, if this be true, the cause would be worth investigating. In  some places they are perfectly level, and almost flush with the  sea; in others they swell gently to perhaps 100 feet; in other  parts, again, they look like scarps and earth-works, remarkably  resembling the lower parasitic craters of a huge volcano; and  here and there they are pitted with sinks like the sea-board of  Loango. These savannahs (savánas) add an indescribable charm to  the Gaboon Coast, especially when the morning and evening suns  strike them with slanting rays, and compel them to stand out  distinct from the setting of eternal emerald. The aspect of the  downs is civilized as the banks of the Solent; and the coast  wants nothing to complete the \"fine, quiet old-country picture in  the wilds of Africa\" but herds of kine grazing upon leas shining  with a golden glory, or a country seat, backed by the noble  virgin forest, such a bosquet as Europe never knew.    After another hour's walk, which carried us about three miles, we  sighted in one of these prairillons a clump of seventeen huts. A  negro in European clothes, after prospecting the party through a  ship's glass, probably the gift of some slaver, came down to meet  us, and led the way to his \"town.\" Finding his guest an  Englishman, the host, who spoke a few words of French and  Portuguese, at once began to talk of his \"summer gîte\" where  pirogues were cut out, and boats were built; there were indeed  some signs of this industrie, but all things wore the true  Barracoon aspect. Two very fine girls were hid behind the huts,  but did not escape my factotum's sharp eyes; and several of the  doors were carefully padlocked: the pretty faces had been removed  when he returned. This coast does an active retail business with  São Thomé and the Ilha do Principe,--about Cape Lopez the \"ebony  trade\" still, I hear, flourishes on a small scale.    During our halt for breakfast at the barracoon, we were visited  by Petit Denis, a son of the old king. His village is marked upon  the charts some four miles south-south-east of his father's; but  at this season all the royalties, we are assured, affect the sea-  shore. He was dressed in the usual loin-wrap, under a broadcloth  coat, with the French official buttons. Leading me mysteriously  aside, he showed certificates from the officials at Le Plateau,  dating from 1859, recommending him strongly as a shipbroker for  collecting émigrants libres, and significantly adding, les nègres  ne manquent pas. Petit Denis's face was a study when I told him  that, being an Englishman, a dozen negroes were not worth to me a  single \"Njína.\" Slave cargoes of some eight to ten head are  easily canoed down the rivers, and embarked in schooners for the  islands: the latter sadly want hands, and should be assisted in  setting on foot a system of temporary immigration.    At 10.45 A.M. we resumed our march. The fiery sun had sublimated  black clouds, the northeast quarter looked ugly, and I wished to  be housed before the storm burst. The coast appeared populous; we  met many bushmen, who were perfectly civil, and showed no fear,  although some of them had probably never seen a white face. All  were armed with muskets, and carried the usual hunting talismans,  horns and iron or brass bells, hanging from the neck before and  behind. We crossed four sweet-water brooks, which, draining the  high banks, flowed fast and clear down cuts of loose, stratified  sand, sometimes five feet deep: the mouths opened to the north-  west, owing to the set of the current from the south-west, part  of the great Atlantic circulation running from the Antarctic to  the equator. Those which are not bridged with fallen trees must  be swum during the rains, as the water is often waist-deep. Many  streamlets, shown by their feathery fringes of bright green palm,  run along the shore before finding an outlet; they are excellent  bathing places, where the salt water can be washed off the skin.  The sea is delightfully tepid, but it is not without risk,--it  becomes deep within biscuit-toss, there is a strong under-tow,  and occasionally an ugly triangular fin may be seen cruizing  about in unpleasant proximity. As our naked feet began to  blister, we suddenly turned to the left, away from the sea; and,  after crossing about 100 yards of prairillon, one of the  prettiest of its kind, we found ourselves at Bwámánge, the  village of King Lángobúmo. It was then noon, and we had walked  about three hours and a half in a general south-south-west  direction.    His majesty's hut was at the entrance of the village, which  numbered five scattered and unwalled sheds. He at once led us to  his house, a large bamboo hall, with several inner sleeping rooms  for the \"Harím;\" placed couch, chair, and table, the civilization  of the slave-trade; brought wife No. 1 to shake hands, directed a  fowl to be killed, and, sitting down, asked us the news in  French. As a return for our information, he told us that the  Gorilla was everywhere to be found, even in the bush behind his  town. The rain coming down heavily, I was persuaded to pass the  night there, the king offering to beat the bush with us, to  engage hunters, and to find a canoe which would carry the party  to Sánga-Tánga, landing us at all the likely places. I agreed the  more willingly to the suggestion of a cruize, as my Mpongwe  fashionables, like the Congoese, and unlike the Yorubans, proved  to be bad and untrained walkers; they complained of sore feet,  and they were always anticipating attacks of fever.    When the delicious sea-breeze had tempered the heat, we set out  for the forest, and passed the afternoon in acquiring a certainty  that we had again been \"done.\" However, we saw the new guides,  and supplied them with ammunition for the next day. The evening  was still and close; the Ifúrú (sandflies) and the Nchúná (a red  gad-fly) were troublesome as usual, and at night the mosquitoes  phlebotomized us till we hailed the dawn.[FN#18] A delightful  bath of salt followed by fresh water, effectually quenched the  fiery irritation of these immundicities.    Wednesday, as we might have expected, was wasted, although the  cool and cloudy weather was perfection for a cruize. As we sat  waiting for a boat, a youth rushed in breathless, reporting that  he had just seen an \"ole man gorilla\" sitting in a tree hard by.  I followed him incredulously at first, but presently the crashing  of boughs and distant grunts, somewhat like huhh! huhh! huhh!  caused immense excitement. After half a day's hard work, which  resulted in nothing, I returned to Bwámánge, and met the \"boat-  king,\" whose capital was an adjacent settlement of three huts. He  was in rags, and my diary might have recorded, Reçu un roi dans  un très fichu état. He was accompanied by a young wife, with a  huge toupel, and a gang of slaves, who sat down and stared till  their eyes blinked and watered. For the loan of his old canoe he  asked the moderate sum of fifteen dollars per diem, which finally  fell to two dollars; but there was a suspicious reservation anent  oars, paddles and rudder, mast and sail.    Meanwhile the sanguine Selim compelled his guide to keep moving  in the direction of the gorilla's grunt, and explaining his  reluctance to advance by the fear of meeting the brute in the  dark."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#18)"],[1,"actories, and attribute dysentery to the use of  river-water. According to Mr. George Maxwell, the supply of the  lower bed has the quality of rotting cables, and the same  peculiarity was attributed to the Tanganyika.    Of late years no ship has ventured above Boma, and boats have  ascended with some difficulty, owing to the \"buffing stream.\" Yet  there is no reason why the waters should not be navigated, as  proposed in 1816, by small steamers of good power, and the strong  sea-breeze would greatly facilitate the passage. In older and  more enterprising days merchant-schooners were run high up the  Zaire. The master of a vessel stated to Tuckey that he \"had been  several voyages up to the distance of 140 miles from the mouth\"  without finding any difficulty.    Our course passed by Banza Chisalla where, as we had paid double,  there was a vain attempt to make us pay treble. Travelling up the  south-eastern reach, we passed a triangular insulated rock off  the southern bank, and then the \"diabolitos\" outlying Point Kilu,  opposite Banza Vinda on the other side. A second reach winding to  the north-east showed on the right Makula (Annan) River, and a  little further Munga-Mungwa (Woodhouslee); between them is the  terminus of the São Salvador road. On the northern bank where the  hills now become rounded mountains, 1,500 feet above the stream,  perches Chinimi the village of Manbuku Prata, who expects canoes  here to await his orders; and who was sorely offended because I  passed down without landing. The next feature of the chart,  Matádi \"Memcandi,\" is a rocky point, not an island. Turning a  projection, Point Makula (Clough Corner), we entered No. 3, elbow  bending southeast; on its concave northern side appeared the  settlement Vinda la Nzádi. This is the Vinda le Zally of Tuckey;  on the chart Veinde len Zally, and according to others Vinda de  Nzadi, or village of the Zaire River. It is probably the \"Benda\"  of the Introduction (p. xxxiv.); and as b and v sound alike in  Fiote, Cabinda, Cabenda or Kabendah is evidently Ca-vinda--great  village.    Our terminus that day was the usual resting-place of travellers,  \"Mfumba\" behind Nkumungu (Point) Kaziwa, a mass of granitoid  slabs, with a single tree for landmark. Opposite us was Sandi ya  Nzondo, which others call Sanga ya Ngondo; in the chart this one-  tree island is written \"Catlo Zonda,\" it is the first of two  similar formations. Oscar Rock, its western (down stream)  neighbour, had shared the fate of \"Soonga lem Paccula,\" (Zunga  chya Makula?) a stone placed in the map north-east of the Makula  or Annan debouchure; both were invisible, denoted only by swirls  in the water. We had taken seven hours to cover what we easily  ran down in two, and we slept comfortably with groan of rock and  roar of stream for lullaby.    September 7.--Our course now lay uninterruptedly along the left  bank, where the scenery became yet more Rhine-like, in natural  basins, reaches on the chart: here and there rugged uprocks  passably simulated ruined castles. The dwarf bays of yellow sand  were girt by a goodly vegetation, the palm and the calabash only  telling us that we were in Africa.    Our men pointed to the work of a Nguvu or hippopotamus, which  they say sometimes attacks canoes; they believe with Tuckey that  the river-horses cause irregularity of soundings by assembling  and trampling deep holes in the bed; but the Ngadi is a proof  that they do not, as M. du Chaillu supposes, exclusively affect  streams with shoals and shallows. The jacaré (crocodile) is known  especially to avoid the points where the current sweeps swiftly  past, yet no one will hang his hand over the canoe into the  water: we did not see any of these wretches, but at Boma Coxswain  Deane observed one about sixteen feet long.    Curls of smoke arose from the mountain-walls of the trough,  showing that the bush was being burned; and spired up from a  grassy palm-dotted plain, between two rocky promontories on the  left bank, the site of the Chacha or Wembo village: in a gap of  the herbage stood half-finished canoes, and a man was bobbing  with rod, line, and float. After an hour's paddling we halted for  breakfast under \"Alecto Rock,\" a sheer bluff of reddish schist,  150 feet high; here a white trident, inverted and placed ten feet  above the water, showed signs of H.M. Ship \"Alecto,\" (late)  Captain Hunt, whose boat passed up in 1855. The people call it  Chimbongolo. The river is now three quarters of a mile wide, and  the charming cove shows the brightest of sands and the densest of  vegetation waving in the cool land-wind.    Resuming our way at 9 P.M., we passed on the left \"Scylla Rocks,\"  then a wash, and beyond them four high and tree-clad heads off  the right bank. Three are islets, the Zunga chya Gnombe--of the  bull--formed by a narrow arm passing round them to the north:  other natives called them Zunga chya Umbinda, but all seem to  differ. These are the Gombac Islands of the chart, Hall Island  being the easternmost, and the northern passage between the three  horns and the main is called by us \"Gombac Creek.\" Half an hour  beyond was a mass of villages, in a large, grassy low-land of the  left bank, girt by mountains higher than those down stream. Some  outlying huts were called by the interpreters Suko Nkongo, and  formed the \"beach town\" of large interior settlements, Suko do  Wembo and Mbinda. Others said Lasugu or Sugo Nkongo, the Sooka  Congo of the charts: others again for \"Mbinda\" proposed \"Mpeso  Birimba.\" This is probably the place where according to the mail  of November, 73, diamonds were found, and having been submitted  to \"Dr. Basham (Dr. Bastian before mentioned), Director of the  Museum of Berlin,\" were pronounced to be of very fine water. It  is possible that the sandstone may afford precious stones like  the itacolumite of the Brazil (\"Highlands of the Brazil,\" i.  380), but the whole affair proved a hoax. In mid-stream rose No.  2, \"One-Tree Island,\" Zunga chya Nlemba or Shika chya Nzondo; in  Tuckey it is called Boola Beca or Blemba (the husband) Rock; the  old ficus dying at the head, was based upon a pedestal which  appeared groin-shaped from the east. Here the mirage was very  distinct, and the canoes seemed to fly, not to swim--         \"As when far out of sea a fleet descried,        Hangs in the clouds.\"     The northern bank shows a stony projection called by Maxwell  \"Fiddler's Elbow;\" it leads to the fourth reach, the second of  the north-eastern series; and the breadth of the stream, once  more a mountain lake, cannot be less than two miles.    I foresaw trouble in passing these settlements. Presently a  snake-like war canoe with hawser-holes like eyes, crept out from  the southern shore; a second fully manned lay in reserve, lurking  along the land, and armed men crowned the rocks jutting into the  stream. We were accosted by the first craft, in which upon the  central place of honour sat Mpeso Birimbá, a petty chief of Suko  Nkongo; a pert rascal of the French factory, habited in a red  cap, a green velvet waistcoat, and a hammock-shaped tippet of  pine-apple fibre; his sword was a short Sollingen blade. The  visit had the sole object of mulcting me in rum and cloth, and my  only wish was naturally to expend as little as possible in mere  preliminaries. The name of Manbuku Prata was duly thrown at him  with but little effect: these demands are never resisted by the  slave-dealers. After much noise and cries of \"Mwendi\" (miser,  skin-flint) on the part of the myrmidons, I was allowed to  proceed, having given up a cloth twenty-four yards long, and I  felt really grateful to the \"trade\" which had improved off all  the other riverine settlements. Beyond this point we saw nothing  but their distant smokes.    Before the second north-eastern reach, the interpreters exclaimed  \"Yellala falla\"--\"the cataract is speaking,\" and we could  distinctly hear the cheering roar. The stream now assumed the  aspect of Niagara below the Falls, and the circular eddies  boiling up from below, and showing distinct convexity, suggested  the dangerous \"wells\" of the northern seas. Passing the \"Three  Weird Sisters,\" unimportant rocks off, the right bank, we entered  upon the remarkably long stretch, extending upwards of five  miles, and, from its predominating growth, we proposed to call it  \"Palmyra Reach.\" The immediate river banks were clad with sedge,  and the broad leaves of the nymphæa, a plant like the calamus of  Asia, but here used only as a toothpick, began to oust the rushy  and flaggy growth of the lower bed. The pink balls of the spinous  mimosa, and bright flowers, especially the convolvulus and  ipomaea, illuminated the dull green. The grassy land at the foot  of the mountains was a mere edging, faced by outlying rocks, and  we were shown the site of a village long ago destroyed.    The Nteba, or palmyra nobilis, mixed here and there with a  glorious tamarind, bombax or calabash, forms a thin forest along  the reach, and rarely appears upon the upper hills, where we  should expect it. The people use both fruit and wine, preferring,  however, the liquor of the Ebah (oil palm-tree), and the autumnal  fires can hardly affect so sturdy a growth. The other trees are  the mfuma, cotton-tree or bombax (Pentandria truncospinoso,  Smith), much valued as a canoe: Merolla uses Mafuma, a plural  form, and speaks of its \"wonderful fine wool.\" The wild figs show  glorious stature, a truly noble growth, whose parents were sun  and water.    The birds were lank black clivers (Plotus), exceedingly wild; the  African roller (Coracias); halcyons of several species,  especially a white and black kingfisher, nimble and comely; many  swallows, horn-bills, and wild pigeons which made the bush  resound; ardeine birds, especially a heron, like the large Indian  \"kullum;\" kites, crows, \"whip-poor-wills,\" and a fine haliaetus,  which flies high and settles upon the loftiest"]]]
