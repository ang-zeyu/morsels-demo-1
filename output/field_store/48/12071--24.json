The furniture consisted of guns and swords hanging on the walls.    The owner is an old Kurd with some handsome sons with ruddy  complexions and auburn hair. The big house is the patriarchal roof,  where the patriarch, his sons, their wives and children, and their  animals, dwell together. The women, however, had all been got rid of  somehow. The old Kurd made a great fire on the dais, wood being  plentiful, and crouched over it. My bed was pitched near it, and  enclosed by some reed screens. With chairs and a table, with routes,  maps, writing materials, and a good lantern upon it, an excellent  dinner of soup and a leg of mutton, cooked at a bonfire in the middle  of the floor, and the sight of all the servants and _katirgis_ lying  round it, warm and comfortable, and the knowledge that we were above  the mud, the clouds of blinding smoke which were the only drawback  scarcely affected the cheerfulness and comfort of the blazing,  unstinted fire. The doorway gave not only ample ventilation but a  brilliant view of snow, and of myriads of frosty stars.    It was infinitely picturesque, with the fitful firelight falling on  the uncouth avenues of blackened tree-stumps, on big dogs, on  mild-eyed ox faces and long ass ears, on turbaned Indian heads, and on  a confused crowd of Turks, Kurds, and Persians, some cooking, some  sleeping, some smoking, while from the black depth beyond a startling  bray of an ass or the abortive shriek of a mule occasionally  proceeded, or a stray mule created a commotion by rushing in from the  snow outside.    I slept comfortably, till I was awakened early by various country  sounds--the braying of an ass into my ear (for I was within a few  inches of the stable), the crowing of cocks, and some hens picking up  crumbs upon my bed. The mules were loaded in the living-room. The  mercury was only 26 deg. at 9 A.M., and under cloudless sunshine the  powdery snow glittered and crackled. There were difficulties ahead, we  heard. The road heavily blocked with snow was only just open, and the  Persian post, which should have passed forty-eight hours before, had  not been heard of, showing that the snow is very deep farther on.    It was beautiful, that uplifted, silent world of snow and mountains,  on whose skirts for some miles grew small apple and pear trees, oak,  ash, and hawthorn, each twig a coral spray. In the deepest depression,  among great rocks, now masses of snow, tumbles a now partially  arrested stream, gleaming with icicles, one of the head-waters of the  Holwan. After getting through this picturesque forest of scrub, the  road emerges on the plateau of the Kirrind valley, the greatest  altitude of which is about 5800 feet. It is said to be irrigated and  fertile. It is now, as I describe it, a wide valley, without a tree or  bush, a rolling plain of snow from two to three feet deep, marked only  by lines made by birds' feet and the beating of the tips of birds'  wings, the track across it a corrugated trench, wide enough for one  mule, the sun brilliant, the sky blue, the surface of the snow  flashing light from millions of crystals with a glitter not to be  borne, all dazzling, \"glistering,\" silent,--a white world and a blue  heaven, with a sun \"shining in his strength,\"--light without heat.    It has been a tremendous day's march, only fourteen miles in seven and  a half hours of severe toil! The _katirgis_ asked us to keep together  in case of difficulties with caravans. Difficulties indeed! A mild  term! I was nearly smashed. I little knew what meeting a caravan in  these circumstances meant till we met the first sixty animals, each  laden with two heavy packing-cases. The question arises who is to  give way, and who is to drive his heavily-laden beasts off the track,  to struggle, flounder, and fall in three feet of snow, not to get up  again without being unloaded, and even then with difficulty.    The rub came on a bank near a stream where there was a deep drift. I  decided to give way, but nothing would induce my mule to face the  snow. An orderly was in front and Hadji behind. Down the track came  sixty animals, loaded with their great packing-cases. They could not  and would not give way, and the two caravans came into collision.  There were mules struggling and falling, loads overturned, muleteers  yelling and roaring, Hadji groaning \"God help us!\" my mule, a new one,  a big strong animal, unused to a bit, plunging and kicking, in the  middle of a \"free fight.\" I was struck hard on my ankle by a  packing-case and nearly knocked off. Still, down they came, in  apparently endless hordes; my mule plunged her bridle off, and kicked  most violently; there were yells all round. My snow spectacles were  knocked off and lost, then came another smash, in which I thought a  bone was broken. Fearing that I should be laid up with a broken limb  for weeks in some horrible caravanserai, and really desperate with the  danger and confusion, I called over and over again to Hadji to get off  and pull my mule into the snow or I should be killed! He did not stir,  but sat dazed on his pack moaning \"God help us!\" till he, the mule,  and the load were rolled over in the drift. The orderly contrived to  get the bridle on my mule, and to back his own in front of me, and as  each irrepressible animal rolled down the bank he gave its load a  push, which, nicely balanced as these loads are, made it swerve, and  saved me from further damage. Hadji had rolled off four times  previously, and the last I saw of him at that time and of the caravan  was a man, five mules, and their loads buried in the snow. The  personal results to me of what is euphemistically called a  \"difficulty,\" are my blue glasses gone, a number of bruises, a  badly-torn riding-skirt, and a bad cut, which bled profusely, and then  the blood froze.    A number of caravans snowed up for several days were _en route_, and  there were many similar encounters, and donkeys and mules falling with  their loads and rolling into the deep snow, and _katirgis_ coming to  blows over the right-of-way. If a donkey is forced off the track it  goes down at once. I unfortunately caught my foot in the pack of one  and rolled it over, and as it disappeared in the snow its pack and  saddle fell over its head and displayed the naked vertebrae of its poor  back.    This Kirrind valley must be fully twenty miles long by from two to  five broad, but there was only one village inhabited and two in ruins.  As we floundered along in the snow with our jaded animals, two  well-armed men on fine horses met and joined us, sent by the _Agha_  Abdul Rahim, son of the British agent at Kirmanshah, whose guests we  are to be. Following them was a _taktrawan_ or litter for me, a wooden  box with two side doors, four feet high, six feet long, and three feet  wide. At each end are long shafts, and between each pair of shafts a  superb mule, and each mule has a man to lead him. I could never use  such a thing except in case of a broken limb, but I am very grateful  to Abdul Rahim for sending it fifty-six miles.    The temperature fell with the sun; the snowy hills took on every shade  of rose and pink, and in a universal blush of tender colouring we  reached Kirrind. All of a sudden the colour died out, the rose-flushed  sky changed to blue-gray, and pallid wastes of unbroken snow  stretching into the gray distance made a glorious winter landscape.  We are now fairly in for the rigours of a Persian winter.    Kirrind, the capital of the Kirrind Kurds, is either grotesquely or  picturesquely situated in and around a narrow gap in a range of lofty  hills, through which the Ab-i-Kirrind rushes, after rising in a spring  immediately behind. The gap suggests the word jaws, and in these open  jaws rise one above another flat-roofed houses straggling down upon  the plain among vineyards, poplars, willows, fruit-trees, and immense  walnuts and gardens. There are said to be 900 houses, but many of them  are ruinous. The stream which bursts from the hills is divided into  innumerable streamlets, which must clothe these gardens with beauty.    A _far[=a]sh_ riding on ahead had engaged a house, so we avoided the  horrors of the immense caravanserai, crammed to-night with storm-bound  caravans. The house is rough, but has three adjoining rooms, and the  servants are comfortable. A fire, with its usual accompaniment of  stinging smoke, fails to raise the temperature of my room to the  freezing-point, yet it is quite possible to be comfortable and employ  oneself.    _Mahidasht, Jan. 24._--My room at Kirrind was very cold. The ink  froze. The mercury fell to 2 deg. below zero in it, and outside in the sun  was only 14 deg. at 8.30. There was a great Babel at starting. Some men  had sold four chickens for the high price of 2s. each, the current  price being 6d., and had robbed the servants of two, and they took one  of the mules, which was sent after us by an official. Slipping,  floundering, and falling in the deep snow, and getting entangled among  caravans, we rode all day over rolling levels. The distance seemed  interminable over the glittering plains, and the pain and stiffness  produced by the intense cold were hard to bear, and it was not  possible to change the cramped position by walking. The mercury fell  to 4 deg., as with tired animals we toiled up the slope on which Harunabad  stands.    A very large caravanserai and a village of sixty houses occupy the  site of a town built by Harun-al-Raschid on the upper waters of the  Kerkhah. It has the reputation of being one of the coldest places in  Persia, so cold that its Ilyat inhabitants desert it in winter,  leaving two or three men who make a business of supplying caravans.  Usually people come out of the villages in numbers as we arrive, but  we passed group after group of ruinous hovels without seeing a  creature. We obtained awfully cold rooms at a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#18)"],[1,"-Zaz, beyond which again rises the equally precipitous  range of the Kuh-i-Ruhbar. Near the Holiwar valley is a mountain  formed by a singular arrangement of rocky buttresses, surmounted by a  tooth-like rock, the Tuk-i-Karu, of which the guide told the legend  that in \"ancient times\" a merchant did a large trade in a tent at the  top of it, and before he died buried his treasure underneath it.    A very striking object from the top is the gorge or canyon, the  Tang-i-Bahrain, by which the Ab-i-Burujird leaves the plain of  Silakhor and enters upon its rough and fretted passage through  ravines, for the most part inaccessible except to practised Ilyat  mountaineers.    \"Had I come up to dig for the hidden treasure of Tuk-i-Karu?\" the  guide asked. \"Was I seeking gold? Or was I searching for medicine  plants to sell in Feringhistan?\"    The three days here have been rather lively. The information  concerning routes has been singularly contradictory. There is a path  which descends over 4000 feet to the Holiwar valley, through which,  for certain reasons, it is desirable to pass. Some say it is  absolutely impassable for laden mules, others that it can be traversed  with precautions, others again that they would not take even their  asses down; that there are shelving rocks, and that if a mule slipped  it would go down to ----. Hadji with much force urges that we should  descend to the plain, and go by a comparatively safe route to  Khuramabad, leave the heavy baggage there, and get a strong escort of  _sowars_ from the Governor for the country of the Pulawands. There is  much that is plausible in this plan, the Sahib approves of it, and the  Agha, with whom the decision rests, has taken it into very careful  consideration, but I am thoroughly averse to it, though I say nothing.    Hadji says he cannot risk his mules on the path down to the Holiwar  valley. I could have filled pages with the difficulties which have  been grappled with during the last few weeks of the journey as to  guides, routes, perils, etc., two or three hours of every day being  occupied in the attempt to elicit truth from men who, from either  inherent vagueness and inaccuracy or from a deliberate intention to  deceive, contradict both themselves and each other, but on this  occasion the difficulties have been greater than ever; the order of  march has been changed five times, and we have been obliged to remain  here because the Agha has not considered that the information he has  obtained has warranted him in coming to a decision.    Yesterday evening the balance of opinion was definitely against the  Holiwar route, and Hadji was so vehemently against it that he shook a  man who said it was passable. This morning the Sahib with a guide and  Abbas Ali examined the road. The Sahib thought it was passable. Abbas  Ali said that the mules would slip off the shelving rocks. All day  long there have been Lur visitors, some saying one thing, and some  another, but a dream last night reconciled Hadji to take the route,  and the Agha after carefully weighing the risks all round has decided  upon it.    All these pros and cons have been very interesting, and there have  been various little incidents. I have had many visitors and \"patients\"  from the neighbouring camp, and among them three of the men who fired  upon us.    The trifle of greatest magnitude was the illness of Aziz's mare, the  result of a kick from _Screw_. She had an enormous swelling from knee  to shoulder, could not sleep, and could hardly eat, and as she belongs  partly to Isfandyar Khan, Aziz Khan has been distracted about her, and  has distracted me by constant appeals to me to open what seemed an  abscess. I had not the courage for this, but it was done, and the cut  bled so profusely that a pad, a stone, and a bandage had to be  applied. Unfortunately there was no relief from this venture, and Aziz  \"worrited\" me out of my tent three times in the night to look at the  creature. Besides that, he had about twenty ailing people outside the  tent at 6 A.M., always sending to me to \"come at once.\"    He was told to wash the wound, but he would do nothing till I went out  with my appliances, very grudgingly, I admit. The sweet animal was  indeed suffering, and the swelling was much increased. A number of men  were standing round her, and when I told Aziz to remove the clot from  the wound, they insisted that she would bleed to death, and so the  pros and cons went on till Aziz said, \"The _Khanum_ shall do it, these  Feringhi _Hak[=i]ms_ know everything.\" To be regarded as a _Hak[=i]m_  on the slenderest possible foundation is distressing, but to be  regarded as a \"vet\" without any foundation at all is far worse.    However, the clot was removed, and though the wound was three inches  long there was still no relief, and Aziz said solemnly, \"Now do what  you think best.\" Very gradual pressure at the back of the leg brought  out a black solid mass weighing fully a pound. \"God is great!\"  exclaimed the bystanders. \"May God forgive your sins!\" cried Aziz, and  fell at my feet with a genuine impulse of gratitude. He insists that  \"a pound of flesh\" came out of the swelling. The wound is now syringed  every few hours, and Aziz is learning how to do this, and to dress it.  The mare can both eat and sleep, and will soon be well.    This evening Aziz said that fifteen _tumans_ would be the charge for  curing his mare, and that, he says, is my present to him. He told me  he wanted me to consider something very thoroughly, and not to answer  hastily. He said, \"We're a poor people, we have no money, but we have  plenty of food. We have women who take out bullets, but in all our  nation there is no _Hak[=i]m_ who knows the wisdom of the Feringhis.  Your medicines are good, and have healed many of our people, and  though a _Kafir_ we like you well and will do your bidding. The Agha  speaks of sending a _Hak[=i]m_ among us next year, but you are here,  and though you are old you can ride, and eat our food, and you love  our people. You have your tent, Isfandyar Khan will give you a horse  of pure pedigree, dwell among us till you are very old, and be our  _Hak[=i]m_, and teach us the wisdom of the Feringhis.\" Then, as if a  sudden thought had struck him, he added, \"And you can cure mules and  mares, and get much money, and when you go back to Feringhistan you'll  be very rich.\"    In nearly every camp I have an evening \"gossip\" with the guides and  others of the tribesmen, and, in the absence of news from the larger  world, have become intensely interested in Bakhtiari life as it is  pictured for me in their simple narratives of recent forays, of  growing tribal feuds and their causes, of blood feuds, and of bloody  fights, arising out of trivial disputes regarding camping-grounds,  right of pasture, right to a wounded bird, and things more trivial  still. They are savages at heart. They take a pride in bloodshed,  though they say they are tired of it and would like to live at peace,  and there would be more killing than there is were it not for the  aversion which some of them feel to the creation of a blood feud. When  they do fight, \"the life of a man is as the life of a sheep,\" as the  Persian proverb runs. Mirza says that among themselves their talk is  chiefly of guns and fighting. The affairs of the mountains are very  interesting, and so is the keen antagonism between the adherents of  the Ilkani and those of Isfandyar Khan.    Sometimes the conversation takes a religious turn. I think I wronged  Aziz Khan in an earlier letter. He is in his way much more religious  than I thought him. A day or two ago I was asking him his beliefs  regarding a future state, which he explained at much length, and which  involve progressive beatitudes of the spirit through a course of one  hundred years. He laid down times and seasons very definitely, and was  obviously in earnest, when two Magawe men who were standing by broke  in indignantly, saying, \"Aziz Khan, how dare you speak thus? These  things belong to God, the Judge, He knows, we don't--we see the spirit  fly away to judgment and we know no more. God is great, He alone  knows.\"    Apparently they have no idea generally of a future except that the  spirit goes either to heaven or hell, according to its works in the  flesh. Some say that they are told that there is an intermediate place  called _Barjakh_, known as the place of evil spirits, in which those  who have died in sin undergo a probation with the possibility of  beneficent results.    On asking what is meant by sin the replies all have the same  tendency,--cowardice, breaches of the seventh commandment (which,  however, seem to be so rare as scarcely to be taken into account,  possibly because of the death penalty attaching to them), disobedience  to a chief when he calls on them to go to war, fraternising with  Sunnis, who are \"accursed,\" betraying to an enemy a man of their own  tribe, and compassing the death of another by poison or evil  machinations.    On being asked what deeds are good, bravery is put first, readiness to  take up a tribal quarrel, charity, i.e. kindness to the poor, undying  hatred to the Caliph Omar, shown by ostracising the Sunnis, hatred of  _Kafirs_, and pilgrimages, especially to Mecca.    Death in battle ensures an immediate entrance into heaven, and this is  regarded as such a cause of rejoicing that not only is the _chapi_ or  national dance performed at a fighting man's grave, but if his death  at a distance has been lawful, _i.e._ if he has been killed in  fighting, they put up a rude temporary cenotaph with his gun, cap,  knife, pipe, and other things about it, and dance, sing, and rejoice.    Otherwise their burial rites are simple. The corpse is washed seven  times in water, certain Arabic formulas for the repose of the soul are  recited, and the body, clothed and wrapped in a winding-sheet, is  carried by four men to the burying-place on a bier"]]]
