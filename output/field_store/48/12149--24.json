While this fulfilment is evidenced by the whole  tenor of New Testament Scripture, a most direct and concise declaration  may be quoted with profit from the Nephite Scriptures, recorded by  holy men who officiated under Divine commission on the American  continent throughout a period of approximately six centuries before and  four centuries after the birth of Christ. The prophet Nephi who was  living at the time of our Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension,  incorporates in his record the words of the Resurrected Savior as  follows:    \"Behold I say unto you, that the law is fulfilled that was given unto  Moses. Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted  with my people Israel: therefore, the law in me is fulfilled, for I  have come to fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end. Behold, I do  not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not been fulfilled in  me, verily I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled.\" (Book of Mormon, 3  Nephi 15:4-6).    A studious reading of the four Gospels demonstrates that while our  Lord recognized the Jewish hierarchy as administrators of an existing  system of government, and complied with all lawful requirements thereof  as such applied to Himself, He proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom in  place of the Mosaic Law, and ordained men to a higher Priesthood than  that of Aaron under which the priests of the Jews claimed to operate.  He commissioned the Twelve Apostles (Matt. 10:1; Mark 3:14; Luke 6:13),  and afterward the Seventy (Luke 10:1). Unto the eleven Apostles who  had remained faithful the Lord gave the parting instruction, shortly  before His ascension: \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel  to every creature.\" The Apostles labored with devoted energy, \"And they  went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and  confirming the word with signs following.\" (See Mark 16:15-20).    The Apostles clearly understood that though the Master had passed from  earth He had left with them authority and commandment to build up the  Church as an established organization. One of their early official  acts was to fill the vacancy in their own body, which had been created  by the apostasy and death of Judas Iscariot. It is evident that they  considered the apostolic body to comprise twelve members and that the  needs of the Church required the organization to be made complete. By  official action Matthias was added to the eleven. (See Acts 1:21-26).    Under the administration of the Apostles and others who officiated  by their direction in positions of lesser authority, the Church of  Jesus Christ grew in membership and influence. For ten years or more  following our Lord's ascension, Jerusalem was the headquarters of  the Church, but branches were established in the outlying provinces,  and these branches, or local \"churches,\" were officered by bishops,  deacons, and other ministers, who were chosen and ordained by apostolic  authority.    We find, operating in their sacred callings in the Primitive Church,  apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, elders, bishops,  priests and deacons. The purpose of these several offices is declared  to be \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,  for the edifying of the body of Christ.\" (Eph. 4:12).    Every office so established is necessary to the development of  the Church, which has been aptly compared to a perfect body with  its several members, each adapted to particular function and all  coordinated for the common good. In an organization planned and  established through Divine wisdom, there are neither superfluities  nor parts wanting. Eye, ear, hand, and foot, each is essential to the  symmetry and physical perfection of the body; in the Church no one in  authority can rightly say to his fellow: \"I have no need of thee.\" (See  1 Cor. 12:12-21).    The Primitive Church was of comparatively short duration. The world  fell into spiritual darkness, and a restoration of power and commission  from the Heavens became necessary to the reestablishment of the Church  with its ancient blessings and privileges. The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints proclaims the imperative need of \"the same  organization that existed in the Primitive Church,\" and solemnly avers  that through the ministration of heavenly beings the Church of Jesus  Christ is restored to earth, for the salvation of mankind both living  and dead.        -- 29 --    WHEN DARKNESS COVERED THE EARTH    The Long Night of Apostasy    WE accept as fact the belief common to Christendom that the Church  of Christ was established under our Lord's personal direction and  that during the early period of apostolic administration the Church  was blessed with rapid growth and marvelous development. A question  of profound importance confronts us: Has the Church of Jesus Christ  maintained an organized existence upon the earth from the apostolic age  to the present?    We affirm that with the passing of the apostolic period the Church  drifted into a condition of apostasy, whereby succession in the Holy  Priesthood was broken; and that the Church as an earthly organization  operating under Divine direction and having authority to officiate in  spiritual ordinances ceased to exist among men. [1]    We affirm that this great apostasy, whereby the world was enshrouded  in spiritual darkness, was foretold by the Savior Himself while He  lived as a Man among men, and by His prophets both before and after the  period of His life in mortality.    The apostolic ministry continued in the Primitive Church for about  sixty years after the death of Christ, or nearly to the end of the  first century of the Christian Era. For some time thereafter the Church  existed as a unified body, officered by men duly invested by ordination  in the Holy Priesthood, though, even during the lifetime of some of the  Apostles, the leaven of apostasy and disintegration had been working.  Indeed, hardly had the Gospel seed been sown before the enemy of all  righteousness had started assiduously to sow tares in the field; and  so intimate was the growth of the two that any forcible attempt to  extirpate the tares would have imperiled the wheat. The evidences  of spiritual decline were observed with anguish by the Apostles  who, however, recognized the fulfilment of earlier prophecy in the  declension, and added their own inspired testimony to the effect that  even a greater falling away was imminent.    The apostasy progressed rapidly, in consequence of a cooperation  of disrupting forces without and within the Church. The dreadful  persecution to which the early Christians were subjected drove great  numbers of Christians to renounce their allegiance to Christianity,  thus causing a widespread apostasy from the Church. But far more  destructive was the contagion of evil that spread within the body,  manifesting its effects mainly in the following developments:    (1) The corrupting of the simple principles of the Gospel of Christ by  admixture with the so-called philosophical systems of the times.    (2) Unauthorized additions to the rites of the Church, and the  introduction of vital changes in essential ordinances.    (3) Unauthorized changes in Church organization and government.    The result of the degeneracy so produced was to bring about an actual  apostasy of the entire Church.    The Apostasy Predicted    Isaiah beheld in vision the condition of mankind during the darkness  of the spiritual night; and he pictures the earth as languishing in  desolation: \"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;  because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken  the everlasting covenant.\" (Isa. 24:1-6).    That the general transgression meant something more than a violation of  Mosaic statutes is evident from the fact that nowhere in Scripture is  the Law of Moses called an \"everlasting covenant,\" but to the contrary,  the covenant of the Gospel is clearly differentiated from the Law.    The prophet Amos foresaw the time of famine and thirst, the day of  futile search for the Word of God. \"Behold, the days come, saith the  Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread,  nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: And they  shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they  shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find  it.\" (Amos 8:11-12).    Christ specifically warned the disciples against the impending  departure from the truth: \"Take heed that no man deceive you\" said He,  \"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive  many.\" (Matt. 24:4, 5). And further: \"Then if any man shall say unto  you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall  arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and  wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the  very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say  unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in  the secret chambers; believe it not.\" (Verses 23-26).    The Apostles bore warning testimony to the same awful certainty. Paul  admonished the elders at Ephesus to be on their guard against the  wolves that would invade the fold, and against false teachers who would  assert themselves \"speaking perverse things to draw away disciples  after them.\" (See Acts 20:28-30). The same Apostle thus wrote to  Timothy: \"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times  some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,  and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their  conscience seared with a hot iron.\" (1 Tim. 4:1, 2; see also 2 Tim.  4:1-4; and 2 Thess. 2:3, 4).

Also from Saco, Maine:        January 20, 1834.        Brethren in the Lord,--I have baptized about forty in this section,      and there are more convinced of the truth, but are still lingering      on the threshold of the Church, and I think the Lord will gather      some of them into His kingdom. Brother Evan M. Greene labored with      me {41} from the 16th of January, 1833, till the October following;      while we were together, we baptized about one hundred and thirty.      Brethren, pray for me, that I may have words of wisdom, and a door      of utterance to declare the whole counsel of God, and rightly      divide the word of truth, giving to every man his portion in due      season; for my determination is, with the stick of Joseph [the Book      of Mormon] in one hand, and the stick of Judah [the Bible] in the      other, to labor diligently in this world, that my skirts may be      clear from the blood of all men, and I stand acquitted before the      bar of God.        I am yours in Christ        (Signed) John F. Boynton.    [Sidenote: Incidents in the Prophet's Journey through Western New York.]    We continued our journey, and, on the 28th of February stayed at a  stranger's, who entertained us very kindly; and on the first of March  arrived at Brother Lewis', in Westfield.    On the 2nd, which was the Sabbath, Brother Parley P. Pratt preached,  and I spoke in the evening; we had a good meeting. There is a small  church in this place, which seems strong in the faith. O may God keep  them in the faith, and save them, and lead them to Zion.    _March 3_.--We intended to start on our journey east, but concluded  to tarry another day. O may God bless us with the gift of utterance  to accomplish the journey and errand on which we are sent, and return  safe to the land of Kirtland, and find my family all well. O Lord,  bless my little children with health and long life, to do good in their  generation, for Christ's sake. Amen.    Since leaving Kirtland, we passed through Thompson, Springfield, Elk  Creek, Erie, Livonia, Silver Creek, Perrysburgh, Collins, China,  Warsaw, Geneseo, Centreville, Catlin and Spafford, before we arrived at  Westfield.    On the 4th instant, we continued our journey from Westfield,  accompanied by Elder Gould; and after a ride of thirty-three miles  arrived at Villanova, and tarried all night with a Brother McBride.    The next morning, March 5th, we went to Brother Nickerson's, and found  him and his household full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.    {42} We called the church together, and related unto them what had  happened to our brethren in Zion, and opened to them the prophecies  and revelations concerning the order of the gathering to Zion, and  the means of her redemption; and I prophesied to them, and the Spirit  of the Lord came mightily upon me, and with all readiness the young  and middle-aged volunteered for Zion. The same evening we held two  meetings, three or four miles distant from each other.    _March 6_.--We held another meeting at Brother Nickerson's. The few  unbelievers that attended were outrageous, and the meeting ended in  complete confusion.    _March 7_.--We proceeded on our journey, accompanied by Brother  Nickerson, leaving Brothers Gould and Matthews to prepare and gather  up the companies in the churches in that region, and meet us in Ohio,  ready to start for Zion on the first of May. We arrived after dark at  Ellicotville, the county seat of Cataraugus, and tried for lodgings at  every tavern in the place. It being court time we found no room; but  were obliged to ride on in the dark, through mud and rain; and, after  traveling about one mile, we found shelter, for which we paid more than  tavern fare.    On the 8th, we arrived at Palmersville, at the house of Elder McGown,  where we were invited to go to Esquire Walker's to spend the evening.  We found them very friendly and somewhat believing, and tarried all  night.    _Sunday, March 9_.--We preached in a school house, and had great  attention. We found a few disciples who were firm in the faith; and,  after meeting found many believing and could hardly get away from them,  and appointed a meeting in Freedom for Monday the 10th, and stayed at  Mr. Warren A. Cowdery's, where we were blessed with a full enjoyment of  temporal and spiritual blessings, even all we needed, or were worthy to  receive.    _Monday 10_.--Met our appointment, and preached to a great  congregation; and at evening again preached to an {43} overflowing  house. After meeting, I proposed if any wished to obey, and would  make it manifest, we would stay to administer to another meeting. A  young man of the Methodist order arose and testified his faith in the  fullness of the Gospel and desired to be baptized. We appointed another  meeting for the next day.    _Tuesday 11_.--Fulfilled our appointment and baptized Heman T. Hyde,  [3] after which we rode nine miles, and put up at Steward's tavern.    _Wednesday 12_.--We arrived at Father Bosley's, after a ride of  thirty-six miles.    _Thursday 13_.--I preached.    _Friday 14_.--At Father Beaman's. [4]    _March 15_.--While at Father Beaman's, Elders Rigdon and Wight arrived,  much to the joy of their souls and the Saints in Livonia.    {44} _Sunday 16_.--Elder Rigdon preached to a large congregation in  Geneseo, Elder Pratt preached in the afternoon of Monday, the 17th.    [Sidenote: The Conference at Avon, Livingston County.]    There was also the same day, March 17, a conference of Elders at Avon,  Livingston county, New York, at the house of Alvah Beaman, which I  attended. There were present also Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, Lyman  Wight, John Murdock, Orson Pratt and Orson Hyde, High Priests; and  six Elders. I stated that the object of the Conference was to obtain  young and middle-aged men to go and assist in the redemption of Zion,  according to the commandment; and for the Church to gather up their  riches, and send them to purchase lands according to the commandment of  the Lord; also to devise means, or obtain money for the relief of the  brethren in Kirtland, say two thousand dollars, which sum would deliver  the Church in Kirtland from debt; and also determine the course which  the several companies shall pursue, or the manner they shall journey  when they shall leave this place.    It was voted by the Council, that Fathers Bosley and Nickerson, Elder  McWithey, and Brother Roger Orton, should exert themselves to obtain  two thousand dollars, for the present relief of Kirtland. They all  agreed to do what they could to obtain it, firmly believing that it  could be accomplished by the first of April. It was also decided  that Elder Orson Hyde should tarry and preach in the regions round  about, till the money should be obtained, and then carry it with him  to Kirtland. It was also voted that I should return to Kirtland,  accompanied by Elders Sidney Rigdon and Lyman Wight. Elders John  Murdock and Orson Pratt were appointed to journey to Kirtland,  preaching by the way; and Elders Parley P. Pratt and Henry Brown to  visit the churches in Black River country, and obtain all the means  they could to help Zion.    _Tuesday, March 18_.--Tarried at Father Bosley's through the day. On  the 19th commenced my journey for {45} Kirtland, and stayed that night  at Brother McWithey's tavern.    _March 20_.--Continued our journey. Dined at Brother Joseph Holbrook's,  and at night tried three times to procure lodgings in the names of  disciples, but could not succeed. After night had commenced we found a  man, in China, named Reuben Wilson, who would keep us for money; thus  we learn there are more places for money than for the disciples of  Jesus, the Lamb of God.    _March 21_.--We came to the house of a man named Starks, six miles east  of Springville; and on the 22nd arrived at Brother Vinson Knight's  in Perrysburgh, Cataraugus county. On the 23rd we arrived at Father  Nickerson's, in Perrysburgh, where we held meeting. On the 24th, I was  not able to start, but felt determined to go the next morning.    _March 25_.--Journeyed from Father Nickerson's to Father Lewis', in  Westfield, accompanied by Father Nickerson. On the 26th, continued our  journey to Elk Creek, and stayed with Elder Hunt. The 27th, I came to  Springfield, where I found Elder Sidney Rigdon, who had come on by a  different route; and we arrived that night within sixteen miles of  Painesville. Arrived home at Kirtland on the 28th of March, finding my  family all well. The Lord be praised for this blessing!    _March 27_.--Remained at home and had great joy with my family. Sunday,  the 30th, was at home, except going to hear Elder Rigdon preach.    Footnotes    1. Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 103.    2. This Mount Pleasant branch of the Church, it will be remembered, was  organized by the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, in the October previous.  See vol. I, chap. 30.    3. Of this incident Elder Parley P. Pratt, who was the Prophet's  traveling companion on this mission, says: \"We baptized a young man  named Heman Hyde; his parents were Presbyterians, and his mother, on  account of the strength of her traditions, thought that we were wrong,  and told me afterwards that she would much rather have followed him  to an earthly grave than to have seen him baptized. Soon afterwards,  however, herself, her husband, and the rest of the family, with  some thirty of forty others, were all baptized and organized into a  branch of the Church--called the Freedom branch--from which nucleus  the light spread and souls were gathered into the fold in all the  regions round.
