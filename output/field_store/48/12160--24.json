In the following scene the weather          becomes fine again and twilight falls, followed at          the close by night._            [_Wotan and Brünnhilde, who lies stretched at his          feet, remain behind alone. A long solemn silence._    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Begins to raise her head a little, and,          commencing timidly, gains confidence as she          proceeds._          Was the offence        So shameful and foul    That to such shame the offender should be          doomed?        Was what I did        So base and so vile    That I must suffer abasement so low?        Was the dishonour        Truly so deep    That it must rob me of honour for aye?            [_She raises herself gradually to a kneeling          posture._          O speak, Father!        In my eye looking,        Calming thy rage,        Taming thy wrath,        Explain why so dark        This deed of mine    That in thy implacable anger    It costs thee thy favourite child!    WOTAN [_His attitude unchanged, gravely and gloomily._          Ask of thy deed,    And that will show thee thy guilt!    BRÜNNHILDE          I but fulfilled        Wotan's command.    WOTAN          By my command    Didst thou fight for the Walsung?    BRÜNNHILDE          Yea, lord of the lots,        So ran thy decree.    WOTAN          But I took back    The order, changed the decree!    BRÜNNHILDE          When Fricka had weaned        Thy will from its purpose;    In yielding what she desired    Thou wert a foe to thyself.    WOTAN [_Softly and bitterly._      I thought thou didst understand me,    And punished thy conscious revolt;        But coward and fool        I seemed to thee!    If I had not treason to punish    Thou wouldst be unworthy my wrath.    BRÜNNHILDE           I am not wise,     But I knew well this one thing--     That thy love was the Wälsung's;         I knew that, by discord         Drawn two ways,     This one thing thou hadst forgotten.         The other only         Couldst thou discern--         What so bitterly         Wounded thy heart:     That Siegmund might not be shielded.    WOTAN          And yet thou didst dare    To shield him, knowing 'twas so?    BRÜNNHILDE [_Beginning softly._          Because I the one thing        Had kept in my eye,        While by twofold desire        Divided wert thou,    Blindly thy back on him turning!        She who wards thy back        From the foe in the field,        She saw alone        What thou sawest not:--    Siegmund I beheld.        Bringing him doom        I approached;        I looked in his eyes,        Gave ear to his words.        I perceived the hero's        Bitter distress;        Loud the lament        Of the brave one resounded;        Uttermost love's        Most terrible pang,        Saddest of hearts        Defying all odds---        With my ear I heard,        My eye beheld    That which stirred the heart in my breast    With trouble holy and strange.        Shamed, astonished,        Shrinking I stood.        Then all my thought        Was how I could serve him;        Triumph and death        To share with Siegmund--        That seemed, that only,        The lot I could choose!        Faithful to him        Who taught my heart this love,        And set me        By the Wälsung's side as friend--    Most faithful to him--    Thy word I disobeyed.    WOTAN          So thou hast done    What I yearned so greatly to do--        What a twofold fate    Withheld from my desire!        So easy seemed to thee    Heart's delight in the winning,        When burning woe        In my heart flamed fierce,        When terrible anguish        Wrung my soul,        When, to save the world        That I loved, love's spring    In my tortured heart I imprisoned?        Against my own self        When I turned, to my torment,        From swooning pain        Arose in a frenzy,        When a wild longing        Burning like fire    The fearful design in me woke    In the ruins of my own world    My unending sorrow to bury,            [_Somewhat freely._          Thy heart was lapped        In blissful delight.        Trembling with rapture,        Drunken with joy,        Thy lips drank laughing        The draught of love,    While I drank of divine woe    Mixed with wormwood and gall.            [_Dryly and shortly._          By thy lightsome heart        Henceforth be guided:    From me thou hast turned away!        I must renounce thee;        Together no more    Shall we two whisper counsel;        Apart our paths lie,        Sundered for ever,    And so long as life lasts    I, the God, dare nevermore greet thee!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Simply._          Unfit was the foolish        Maid for thee,        Who, dazed by thy counsel,        Grasped not thy mind        When, to her, one counsel        Alone appeared plain--    To love what was loved by thee.        If I must forth        Where I shall not find thee,        If the fast-woven bond        Must be loosed,        And half thy being        Far from thee banished--    A half once thine and thine only,    O God, forget not that!--        Thy other self        Thou wilt not dishonour,        Dealing out shame        That will shame thee too;    Thine own honour were lowered,    Were I a target for scorn!    WOTAN          The lure of love        Thou hast followed fain:        Follow the man        Who shall wield its might!    BRÜNNHILDE      If I must go from Walhall,    No more in thy work be a sharer,        And if as my master        A man I must serve,        I braggart base        Abandon me not!        Not all unworthy        Be he who wins!    WOTAN      With Wotan no part hast thou--    He cannot fashion thy fate.    BRÜNNHILDE      By thee has been founded a race    Too glorious to bring forth a coward    One day must a matchless hero    From Walsung lineage spring.    WOTAN      Name not the Wälsungs to me!        Renouncing thee,        Them too I renounced;    Through envy they came to naught.    BRÜNNHILDE          She who turned from thee        Rescued the race;            [_With an air of secrecy._          Sieglinde bears        Fruit holy and high;        In pain and woe        Beyond woe known to woman        She will bring forth        What in fear she hides!    WOTAN           No shelter for her         Seek at my hand,     Nor for fruit that she may bear.    BRÜNNHILDE          The sword she has kept        That thou gavest Siegmund.

Await thou the lot        Cast and decreed;    I cannot choose it or change!        But now I must forth,        Fare from thee far;    Too long I stay by thy side.        I must turn from thee,        As thou didst from me;        I must not even        Know thy desire;        Thy doom alone    I must see fulfilled!    BRÜNNHILDE          And what is the doom        That I must suffer?    WOTAN          In slumber fast        Thou shalt be locked;    Wife thou shalt be to the man    Who finds and wakes thee from sleep!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Falls on her knees._          If fettering sleep        Fast must bind me,        An easy prey        To the basest coward,    This one thing that in deep anguish    I plead for thou must accord!        O shield thou the sleeper        With soul-daunting terrors,            [_Firmly._          That by a dauntless        Hero alone        Here on the rock        I may be found!    WOTAN          Too much thou askest--        Too big a boon!    [Illustration: Plate 32      WOTAN.      \"Appear, flickering fire,       Encircle the rock with thy flame!          Loge! Loge!

[_With wild ecstasy._          O cause a fire        To burn at thy bidding,        With flame fiercely flaring        Girdle the rock,        And may its tongue lick,        And may its tooth eat    The coward who, daring, rashly    Approaches the terrible spot!    WOTAN            [_Overcome and deeply stirred, turns quickly          towards Brünnhilde, raises her from her knees and          looks into her eyes with emotion._          Farewell, thou valiant,        Glorious child!        Thou the most holy        Pride of my heart,    Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!            [_Passionately._          Must we be parted?        Shall I never more        Give thee love's greeting?        Must thou no longer        Gallop beside me,    Nor bring me mead at banquet?        If I must lose thee,        Whom I have loved so,    The laughing delight of my eyes,        For thee there shall burn        A bridal fire brighter    Than ever yet burned for a bride!        Fiercely the flames        Shall flare round thy bed,        Flames dreadful, devouring,        Daunting all cowards;        Let cravens flee        From Brünnhilde's rock!

After he had  dried himself with the soft towels he went into the dressing-room and  took fresh linen from the drawers and put it on, finding that  everything fitted him exactly.  He examined the contents of the closets  and selected an elegant suit of clothing.  Strangely enough, everything  about it was shaggy, although so new and beautiful, and he sighed with  contentment to realize that he could now be finely dressed and still be  the shaggy man.  His coat was of rose-colored velvet, trimmed with  shags and bobtails, with buttons of blood-red rubies and golden shags  around the edges.  His vest was a shaggy satin of a delicate cream  color, and his knee-breeches of rose velvet trimmed like the coat.  Shaggy creamy stockings of silk, and shaggy slippers of rose leather  with ruby buckles, completed his costume, and when he was thus attired  the shaggy man looked at himself in a long mirror with great  admiration.  On a table he found a mother-of-pearl chest decorated with  delicate silver vines and flowers of clustered rubies, and on the cover  was a silver plate engraved with these words:      THE SHAGGY MAN:    HIS BOX OF ORNAMENTS      The chest was not locked, so he opened it and was almost dazzled by the  brilliance of the rich jewels it contained.  After admiring the pretty  things, he took out a fine golden watch with a big chain, several  handsome finger-rings, and an ornament of rubies to pin upon the breast  of his shaggy shirt-bosom.  Having carefully brushed his hair and  whiskers all the wrong way to make them look as shaggy as possible, the  shaggy man breathed a deep sigh of joy and decided he was ready to meet  the Royal Princess as soon as she sent for him.  While he waited he  returned to the beautiful sitting room and ate several of the  red-cheeked apples to pass away the time.    Meanwhile, Dorothy had dressed herself in a pretty gown of soft grey  embroidered with silver, and put a blue-and-gold suit of satin upon  little Button-Bright, who looked as sweet as a cherub in it.  Followed  by the boy and Toto--the dog with a new green ribbon around his  neck--she hastened down to the splendid drawing-room of the palace,  where, seated upon an exquisite throne of carved malachite and nestled  amongst its green satin cushions was the lovely Princess Ozma, waiting  eagerly to welcome her friend.          20.  Princess Ozma Of Oz      The royal historians of Oz, who are fine writers and know any number of  big words, have often tried to describe the rare beauty of Ozma and  failed because the words were not good enough.  So of course I cannot  hope to tell you how great was the charm of this little Princess, or  how her loveliness put to shame all the sparkling jewels and  magnificent luxury that surrounded her in this her royal palace.  Whatever else was beautiful or dainty or delightful of itself faded to  dullness when contrasted with Ozma's bewitching face, and it has often  been said by those who know that no other ruler in all the world can  ever hope to equal the gracious charm of her manner.    Everything about Ozma attracted one, and she inspired love and the  sweetest affection rather than awe or ordinary admiration.  Dorothy  threw her arms around her little friend and hugged and kissed her  rapturously, and Toto barked joyfully and Button-Bright smiled a happy  smile and consented to sit on the soft cushions close beside the  Princess.    \"Why didn't you send me word you were going to have a birthday party?\"  asked the little Kansas girl, when the first greetings were over.    \"Didn't I?\" asked Ozma, her pretty eyes dancing with merriment.    \"Did you?\" replied Dorothy, trying to think.    \"Who do you imagine, dear, mixed up those roads, so as to start you  wandering in the direction of Oz?\" inquired the Princess.    \"Oh!  I never 'spected YOU of that,\" cried Dorothy.    \"I've watched you in my Magic Picture all the way here,\" declared Ozma,  \"and twice I thought I should have to use the Magic Belt to save you  and transport you to the Emerald City.  Once was when the Scoodlers  caught you, and again when you reached the Deadly Desert. But the  shaggy man was able to help you out both times, so I did not interfere.\"    \"Do you know who Button-Bright is?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No; I never saw him until you found him in the road, and then only in  my Magic Picture.\"    \"And did you send Polly to us?\"    \"No, dear; the Rainbow's Daughter slid from her father's pretty arch  just in time to meet you.\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I've promised King Dox of Foxville and King  Kik-a-bray of Dunkiton that I'd ask you to invite them to your party.\"    \"I have already done that,\" returned Ozma, \"because I thought it would  please you to favor them.\"    \"Did you 'vite the Musicker?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"No; because he would be too noisy, and might interfere with the  comfort of others.  When music is not very good, and is indulged in all  the time, it is better that the performer should be alone,\" said the  Princess.    \"I like the Musicker's music,\" declared the boy, gravely.    \"But I don't,\" said Dorothy.    \"Well, there will be plenty of music at my celebration,\" promised Ozma;  \"so I've an idea Button-Bright won't miss the Musicker at all.\"    Just then Polychrome danced in, and Ozma rose to greet the Rainbow's  Daughter in her sweetest and most cordial manner.    Dorothy thought she had never seen two prettier creatures together than  these lovely maidens; but Polly knew at once her own dainty beauty  could not match that of Ozma, yet was not a bit jealous because this  was so.    The Wizard of Oz was announced, and a dried-up, little, old man,  clothed all in black, entered the drawing-room.  His face was cheery  and his eyes twinkling with humor, so Polly and Button-Bright were not  at all afraid of the wonderful personage whose fame as a humbug  magician had spread throughout the world.  After greeting Dorothy with  much affection, he stood modestly behind Ozma's throne and listened to  the lively prattle of the young people.    Now the shaggy man appeared, and so startling was his appearance, all  clad in shaggy new raiment, that Dorothy cried \"Oh!\" and clasped her  hands impulsively as she examined her friend with pleased eyes.    \"He's still shaggy, all right,\" remarked Button-Bright; and Ozma nodded  brightly because she had meant the shaggy man to remain shaggy when she  provided his new clothes for him.    Dorothy led him toward the throne, as he was shy in such fine company,  and presented him gracefully to the Princess, saying:    \"This, your Highness, is my friend, the shaggy man, who owns the Love  Magnet.\"    \"You are welcome to Oz,\" said the girl Ruler, in gracious accents.  \"But tell me, sir, where did you get the Love Magnet which you say you  own?\"    The shaggy man grew red and looked downcast, as he answered in a low  voice:    \"I stole it, your Majesty.\"    \"Oh, Shaggy Man!\" cried Dorothy.  \"How dreadful!  And you told me the  Eskimo gave you the Love Magnet.\"    He shuffled first on one foot and then on the other, much embarrassed.    \"I told you a falsehood, Dorothy,\" he said; \"but now, having bathed in  the Truth Pond, I must tell nothing but the truth.\"    \"Why did you steal it?\" asked Ozma, gently.    \"Because no one loved me, or cared for me,\" said the shaggy man, \"and I  wanted to be loved a great deal.  It was owned by a girl in Butterfield  who was loved too much, so that the young men quarreled over her, which  made her unhappy.  After I had stolen the Magnet from her, only one  young man continued to love the girl, and she married him and regained  her happiness.\"    \"Are you sorry you stole it?\" asked the Princess.    \"No, your Highness; I'm glad,\" he answered; \"for it has pleased me to  be loved, and if Dorothy had not cared for me I could not have  accompanied her to this beautiful Land of Oz, or met its kind-hearted  Ruler.  Now that I'm here, I hope to remain, and to become one of your  Majesty's most faithful subjects.\"    \"But in Oz we are loved for ourselves alone, and for our kindness to  one another, and for our good deeds,\" she said.    \"I'll give up the Love Magnet,\" said the shaggy man, eagerly; \"Dorothy  shall have it.\"    \"But every one loves Dorothy already,\" declared the Wizard.    \"Then Button-Bright shall have it.\"    \"Don't want it,\" said the boy, promptly.    \"Then I'll give it to the Wizard, for I'm sure the lovely Princess Ozma  does not need it.\"    \"All my people love the Wizard, too,\" announced the Princess, laughing;  \"so we will hang the Love Magnet over the gates of the Emerald City,  that whoever shall enter or leave the gates may be loved and loving.\"    \"That is a good idea,\" said the shaggy man; \"I agree to it most  willingly.\"    Those assembled now went in to dinner, which you can imagine was a  grand affair; and afterward Ozma asked the Wizard to give them an  exhibition of his magic.    The Wizard took eight tiny white piglets from an inside pocket and set  them on the table.  One was dressed like a clown, and performed funny  antics, and the others leaped over the spoons and dishes and ran around  the table like race-horses, and turned hand-springs and were so  sprightly and amusing that they kept the company in one roar of merry  laughter.  The Wizard had trained these pets to do many curious things,  and they were so little and so cunning and soft that Polychrome loved  to pick them up as they passed near her place and fondle them as if  they were kittens.    It was late when the entertainment ended, and they separated to go to  their rooms.    \"To-morrow,\" said Ozma, \"my invited guests will arrive, and you will  find among them some interesting and curious people, I promise you.  The next day will be my birthday, and the festivities will be held on  the broad green just outside the gates of the City, where all my people  can assemble without being crowded.\"    \"I hope the Scarecrow won't be"]]]
