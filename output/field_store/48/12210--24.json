Headaches of the real  kind did come later, and, as his habits changed not, the Brights which  first appeared at fifty-eight progressed without interruption to his  death at sixty.    Mrs. Beckman was a blonde, but for many years had been a badly faded  one. She was as singleminded in regard to her household as her husband  to his store. Neither had developed more than family and local  interests. She was the same age as her husband and had, without  question, worked faithfully, long hours, through the long years, in  homage to her sense of housekeeping duties. The coming of the  children, only, from time to time, kept her away from kitchen and  parlor for a few weeks. She had been to Atlanta but once during the  last ten years, not that Mr. Beckman willed it so--she could have had  vacations and attractive dresses, though for some reason, possibly the  \"fading\" which has been mentioned, he never urged her to go with him--  and she needed urging, for she honestly believed there was \"too much  to do\" at home. The habit of industry can become as inveterate as  habits of pleasure.    The two Beckman boys had the virtues of both father and mother. They  finished at the city high school, and at once went to work in the  store with such earnestness of purpose that they were quite prepared  to conduct the business, even better than the father had done, when he  became incapacitated.    We met the sister, Addie, in Stella's room and realized from her  discretion, manifested under stress, that she possessed elements of  character. She was a clear-skinned, high-strung blonde--thin-skinned  too, probably, for from childhood her hands rebelled at household  duties. The family thrift was hers, however, and from the limited  opportunities of the home town, she prepared herself for, and filled  well, for years, a position with a successful law firm. She later  married the senior member--a widower. His children and her high-strung  thin-skinnedness and lack of domestic propensities have not made her  as successful a home-builder as she was a stenographer.    Stella Beckman's early life was deeply influenced by many of the  surroundings which we have glimpsed. Hers was not a home of fine  ideals. Much that was common was always present. The table-talk was  almost competitive in nature, as, with the possible exception of the  mother, each one used \"I\" almost insistently, as a text for converse,  the three times a day they sat together. Even mutual interests were  largely obscured, much of the time, by personal ones, barring only the  subject of sickness. All forms of illness were themes commanding  instant and absorbing attention. Inordinate anxiety was felt by all  for the ills of the one; and for days the \"I\" would be forgotten if  any member of the home-circle was \"sick.\" And the concerns of the  patient, whether suffering from a cold, sore eyes, a sprained ankle,  or \"had her tonsils out,\" were discussed with minuteness of detail  worthy an International Conference. How the patient slept, what the  doctor said, the effect of the new medicine, how the heart was  standing the strain, what the visiting neighbors thought of the case,  in fact the whole subject of sickness held a morbid interest for each  member of the family. Sickness, no matter how slight, was with the  Beckmans ever an excuse for changing any or all plans. We might speak  of the discussion of illness as the Beckman family avocation.    Stella was a bright child, who, wisely directed and influenced, would  have taken a good education. She could have developed into a  particularly pleasing, capable, useful, possibly forceful woman. But  the emotional Stella was over-developed, until it obstructed the  growth of the reasoning Stella. Still we should call her a normal  small-town child, certainly until her last year in grammar-school. She  had some difficulty with her studies that spring because of her eyes.  Her lenses, fitted in Atlanta, seemed to make them worse. It was only  after she went to a noted specialist in Charleston that she was  relieved. It is significant that later these expensively obtained  glasses were discarded as \"too much trouble.\"    The summer Stella was thirteen, Grandmother Beckman came to spend her  last days in her son's home. The granddaughter had been named for her,  and Grandmother was frail and old and needed attention. Grandmother  also had some means. For over a year the young girl gave much of her  time to the old lady, and for over a year she was able to lead the  Beckman table-talk with her wealth of details about Grandma's  sickness. Stella's care of her charge was excellent, entirely lacking  in any selfish element. Death hesitated, when he finally called, and  for nearly a week the dying woman lay unconscious. These \"days of  strain\" and the death and funeral were, always after, mentioned by  Stella and her people as her \"first shock.\" For a time she was so  nervous and restless and her sleep so disturbed that the doctor gave  her hypnotics and advised her being sent away. She went to Atlanta for  two months, boarding in the home of a Methodist minister, who some  years before had been stationed in Rome. It was Stella's first  experience in a religious home. She had never been accustomed to  hearing the \"blessing\" said, and food referred to as \"God-given\"  seemed, at first, quite too sacred to swallow. And the effect of  morning worship--the seriously read Bible chapter, the earnest prayer,  with the entire family kneeling--affected her profoundly, and gave to  this godly home a sanctity which, at susceptible not-yet-fifteen,  awakened emotions so powerful that for days she walked as one in a  dream, one attracted by some wonderful vision which was drawing her,  unresisting, into its very self. Each day was a step closer, and at  prayer-meeting the Wednesday night before she returned home, she  announced her conversion, with an intensity of earnestness which could  but impress every hearer.    Stella Beckman went back to Rome filled with a zeal for the new  religious life which commanded the respect of even her religiously  careless father. Nor was it a flash in the pan. She joined the church.  She made her sister join the church, and to the church she gave four  years of remarkable devotion. Church interests were first, and one  Sunday the pastor publicly announced that for the twelve months past  Stella Beckman had not missed a single service in any branch of the  church's activities. She taught a Sunday-school class. She sang in the  choir. She was president of the Epworth League, and not only attended,  but always \"testified\" at mid-week prayer-meeting. Her church  interests took all her time. The foreign-missionary cause later laid a  gripping hold upon her, and arrangements were made, four years after  she went into the church, for her to go to a Missionary Training-  School.    Somehow things went wrong here. She had expected an almost sanctified  atmosphere. She was accustomed to being regarded as essentially  devout, but there was a sense of order in the school which she felt  was mechanical, class-room work seemed to be counted as important as  religious services, and her fervidly expressed religious experiences  appeared to reflect chill rather than the accustomed warmth of the  home prayer-meetings. Moreover, real lessons were assigned which no  amount of religious feeling or no intensity of personal praying made  easy. She hadn't studied for years; in fact, she had never learned to  do intellectual work studiously. And even these good religious  teachers did not hesitate to demand accurate recitations. She had been  accustomed for years to have preference shown, and here she was  treated only as one of many, and, humiliatingly, as one who was  failing to maintain the standards of the many. She fell behind in the  two most important studies, nor was her classwork in general good.  Whether she would have later proven capable of getting down to rock  bottom and meeting the demands of reason on a rational basis, we  cannot say, for the family hobby abruptly terminated her missionary  career. \"Mother dangerously sick with inflammatory rheumatism. Come at  once,\" the telegram said--and she hastily returned home to be met  with, what her history records as, \"my second shock.\" Her mother  WAS sick, and truly and genuinely suffering. The house was in  disorder. Weeks followed in which Stella's best strength was needed.  Her mother slowly mended, but never regained her old activity. The  doctor said a heart-valve was damaged, and the family thereafter were  never quite certain when the sudden end would come--an uncertainty  which was proven legitimate ten years later, when she died, almost  suddenly. Stella had met shock number two very well. The home-love and  welcome and the warmth of feeling she experienced in the home-church  were a never-admitted relief from the rigid exactions of the training-  school life, and did much to neutralize, for the time, her anxiety  about her mother and the \"strain of her care.\" It was a family which  ever advertised home-devotion, and so this call of home illness  completely obscured all other plans for three years. But home  responsibilities quite wrecked her church-going record. In fact, it  was unkindly whispered that Stella was \"backsliding.\" And these same  whispers found audible expression the summer she was twenty-two, when  attractive Lee Burnham, the judge's son, spent his summer vacation at  home, and \"took her buggy-riding every Sunday evening for over two  months.\"    Lee was only twenty-one, but his was a very romantic twenty-one, and  he filled Stella's ears with so many sweet nothings that she no longer  heeded the call of duty."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#18)"],[1,"an, and in tribes inhabiting the Rocky mountains, the      Mississippi valley, and Florida. The same osteological structure,      swarthy color, straight hair, meagre beard, obliquely cornered      eyes, prominent cheek bones, and thick lips, are common to them      all. * * * * * * Humboldt characterizes the nations of America      as one race, by their straight glossy hair, thin beard, swarthy      complexion and cranial formation. [40]    Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, professor of American archaeology and  linguistics in the University of Pennsylvania--than whom no higher  authority upon the subject can be quoted--says:        On the whole, the race is singularly uniform in its physical      traits, and individuals taken from any part of the continent could      easily be mistaken for inhabitants of numerous other parts. * * * *      * * The culture of the native Americans strongly attests the ethnic      unity of the race. This applies equally to the ruins and relics of      its vanished nations, as to the institutions of existing tribes.      Nowhere do we find any trace of foreign influence or instruction,      nowhere any arts or social systems to explain which we must evoke      the aid of teachers from the eastern hemisphere. * * * * American      culture, wherever examined, presents a family likeness which the      more careful observers of late years have taken pains to put in a      strong light. This was accomplished for governmental institutions      and domestic architecture by Lewis H. Morgan, for property rights      and the laws of war by A. F. Bandelier, for the social condition      of Mexico and Peru by Dr. Gustav Bruhl, and I may add for the      myths and other expressions of the religious sentiment by myself.      * * * The psychic identity of the Americans is well illustrated      in their languages. There are indeed indefinite discrepancies in      their lexicography and in their surface marphology; but in their      logical sub-structure, in what Willhelm von Humboldt called the      \"inner form,\" they are strikingly like. The points in which this is      especially apparent are in the development of pronominal forms, in      the abundance of generic particles, in the overweening preference      for concepts of action (verbs) rather than concepts of existence      (nouns), and in the consequent subordination of the latter to the      former in the proposition. [41]    Following the same general line of thought Nadaillac says:        The Indians, who were successively conquered by foreign invaders,      spoke hundreds of different dialects. Bancroft estimates that there      were six hundred between Alaska and Panama. Ameghino speaks of      eight hundred in South America. Most of these, however, are mere      derivatives from a single mother tongue like the Aymara and the      Guarani. We quote these figures for what they are worth. Philology      has no precise definition of what constitutes a language, and      any one can add to or deduct from the numbers given according      to the point of view from which he considers the matter. As an      illustration of this, it may be mentioned that some philologists      estimate the languages of North America at no less than thirteen      hundred, whilst Squier would reduce those of both continents to      four hundred. These dialects present a complete disparity in      their vocabulary side by side with great similarity of structure.      \"In America,\" says Humboldt, \"from the country of the Esquimaux      to the banks of the Orinoco, and thence to the frozen shores      of the Straits of Magellan, languages differing entirely in      their derivation have, if we may use the expression, the same      physiognomy. Striking analogies in grammatical construction have      been recognized, not only in the more perfect languages, such as      those of the Incas, the Aymara, the Guarani, and the Mexicans, but      also in languages which are extremely crude. Dialects, the roots      of which do not resemble each other more than the roots of the      Slavonian and Biscayan, show resemblances in structure similar to      those which are found between the Sanscrit, the Persian, the Greek,      and the Germanic languages.\" [42]    The fact that the different dialects, or languages, as some call them,  \"are mere derivatives from a single mother tongue,\" argues strongly, of  course, for ultimate race unity.    The following summary of evidences on the substantial unity of race in  American peoples is from Marcus Wilson, and will be found valuable:        Nor indeed is there any proof that the semi-civilized inhabitants      of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central America, were a race different      from the more savage tribes by which they were surrounded; but,      on the contrary, there is much evidence in favor of their common      origin, and in proof that the present tribes, or at least many of      them, are but the dismembered fragments of former nations. The      present natives of Yucatan and Central America, after a remove of      only three centuries from their more civilized ancestors, present      no diversities, in their natural capacities, to distinguish them      from the race of the common Indian. And if the Mexicans and the      Peruvians could have arisen from the savage state, it is not      impossible that the present rude tribes may have remained in it;      or, if the latter were once more civilized than at present, as      they have relapsed into barbarism, so others may have done. The      anatomical structure of the skeletons found within the ancient      mounds of the United States, does not differ more from that of      the present Indians than tribes of the latter, admitted to be of      the same race, differ from each other. In the physical appearance      of all the American aborigines, embracing the semi-civilized      Mexicans, the Peruvians, and the wandering savage tribes, there is      a striking uniformity; nor can any distinction of races here be      made. In their languages there is a general unity of structure, and      a great similarity in grammatical forms, which prove their common      origin; while the great diversity in the words of the different      languages, shows the great antiquity of the period of peopling      America. In the generally uniform character of their religious      opinions and rites, we discover original unity and an identity of      origin; while the diversities here found, likewise indicate the      very early period of the separation and dispersion of the tribes.      Throughout most of the American tribes have been found traces of      the pictorial delineations, and hieroglyphical symbols, by which      the Mexicans and the Peruvians communicated ideas, and preserved      the memory of events. The mythological traditions of the savage      tribes, and the semi-civilized nations, have general features      of resemblance--generally implying a migration from some other      country--containing distinct allusions to a deluge--and attributing      their knowledge of the arts to some fabulous teacher in remote      ages. Throughout nearly the whole continent, the dead were buried      in a sitting posture; the smoking of tobacco was a prevalent      custom, and the calumet, or pipe of peace, was everywhere deemed      sacred. And, in fine, the numerous and striking analogies between      the barbarous and the cultivated tribes, are sufficient to justify      the belief in their primitive relationship and common origin. * * *      * * * With regard to the opinion entertained by some, that colonies      from different European nations, and at different times, have been      established here, we remark, [43] that, if so, no distinctive      traces of them have ever been discovered; and there is a uniformity      in the physical appearance of all the American tribes, which      forbids the supposition of a mingling of different races. [44]    The well established fact, of race unity, is one more evidence for the  truth of the Book of Mormon to be added to that cumulative mass of  evidence we are here compiling, since unity of race is what the Book of  Mormon requires for the peoples of America.    VII.    _Did the Book of Mormon Antedate Works in English on American_  Antiquities, Accessible to Joseph Smith and His Associates.    In the presence of so many resemblances between native American  traditions and Book of Mormon historical incidents and Nephite customs,  I can understand how the question naturally arises in some minds  whether the ancient historical incidents, and the customs of American  peoples--purported to be recorded in the Book of Mormon,--whence the  traditions come, or is it from the native American traditions that the  alleged historical incidents and customs of the Book of Mormon come.  That is to say, was it possible for Joseph Smith or those associated  with him in bringing forth the Book of Mormon to have possessed such  a knowledge of American antiquities and traditions that they could  make their book's alleged historical incidents, and the customs of  its peoples, conform to the antiquities and traditions of the native  Americans? The question may appear foolish to those acquainted with the  character and environment of the Prophet; but to those not acquainted  with him or his environment the question may be of some force, and for  that reason it is considered here.    In the first place, then, it must be remembered how great the task  would be to become sufficiently acquainted with American antiquities  and traditions to make the Book of Mormon story and the alleged customs  of its people agree with the antiquities and traditions of the American  natives, in the striking manner in which we have found them to agree.  In the second place the youthfulness of the Prophet must be taken into  account--he was but twenty-five years of age when the Book of Mormon  was published,"]]]
