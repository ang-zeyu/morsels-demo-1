They constitute the expression of  numberless natural sights and sounds with which we are familiar,  although in a majority of cases the resemblance being but slight, and  to some one quality only, we are not conscious of the cause of the  expression.    It was principally with flowers, which excite more attention and give  more pleasure than most natural objects, that my mind was occupied in  this connection; for here it seemed to me that the effect was similar  to that produced on the mind by sweet human-like tones in bird music.  In other words, a very great if not the principal charm of the flower  was to be traced to the human associations of its colouring; and this  was, in some cases, more than all its other attractions, including  beauty of form, purity and brilliance of colour, and the harmonious  arrangement of colours; and, finally, fragrance, where such a quality  existed.    We see, then, that there is an intimate connection between the two  subjects--human associations in the colouring of flowers and in the  voices of birds; and that in both cases this association constitutes,  or is a principal element in, the expression. This connection, and the  fact that the present subject was suggested and appeared almost an  inevitable outcome of the one last discussed, must be my excuse for  introducing a chapter on flowers in a book on birds--or birds and man.  But an excuse is hardly needed. It must strike most readers that a  great fault of books on birds is, that there is too much about birds  in them, consequently that a chapter about something else, which has  not exactly been dragged in, may come as a positive relief.    As the word expression which occurs with frequency in this chapter was  not understood in the sense in which I used it on the first appearance  of the book, it may be well to explain that it is not used here in its  ordinary meaning as the quality in a face, or picture, or any work of  art, which indicates thought or feeling. Here the word has the meaning  given to it by writers on the aesthetic sense as descriptive of the  quality imparted to an object by its associations. These may be  untraceable: we may not be conscious and as a rule we are not  conscious that any such associations exist; nevertheless they are in  us all the time, and with what they add to an object may enhance and  even double its intrinsic beauty and charm.           *       *       *       *       *    I have somewhere read a very ancient legend, which tells that man was  originally made of many materials, and that at the last a bunch of  wild flowers was gathered and thrown into the mixture to give colour  to his eyes. It is a pretty story, but might have been better told,  since it is certain that flowers which have delicate and beautiful  flesh-tints are attractive mainly on that account, just as blue and  some purples delight us chiefly because of their associations with the  human iris. The skin, too, needed some beautiful colour, and there  were red as well as blue flowers in the bunch; and the red flowers  being most abundant in nature and in greater variety of tints, give us  altogether more pleasure than their beautiful rivals in our affection.    The blue flower is associated, consciously or not, with the human blue  eye; and as the floral blue is in all or nearly all instances pure and  beautiful, it is like the most beautiful human eye. This association,  and not the colour itself, strikes me as the true cause of the  superior attraction which the blue flower has for most of us. Apart  from association blue is less attractive than red, orange, and yellow,  because less luminous; furthermore green is the least effective  background for such a colour as blue in so small an object as a  flower; and, as a fact, we see that at a little distance the blue of  the flower is absorbed and disappears in the surrounding green, while  reds and yellows keep their splendour. Nevertheless the blue has a  stronger hold on our affections. As a human colour, blue comes first  in a blue-eyed race because it is the colour of the most important  feature, and, we may say, of the very soul in man.    Some purple flowers stand next in our regard on account of their  nearness in colour to the pure blue. The wild hyacinth, blue-bottle,  violet, and pansy, and some others, will occur to every one. These are  the purple flowers in which blue predominates, and on that account  have the same expression as the blue. The purples in which red  predominates are akin in expression to the reds, and are associated  with flesh-tints and blood. And here it may be noted that the blue and  blue-purple flowers, which have the greatest charm for us, are those  in which not only the colour of the eye but some resemblance in their  form to the iris, with its central spot representing the pupil,  appears. For example, the flax, borage, blue geranium, periwinkle,  forget-me-not, speedwell, pansy and blue pimpernel, are actually more  to us than some larger and handsomer blue flowers, such as the  blue-bottle, vipers' bugloss, and succory, and of blue flowers seen in  masses.    With regard to the numerous blue and purple-blue flowers which we all  admire, or rather for which we all feel so great an affection, we find  that in many cases their very names have been suggested by their human  associations--by their expression.    Love-in-a-mist, angels' eyes, forget-me-not, and heartsease, are  familiar examples. Heartsease and pansy both strike us as peculiarly  appropriate to one of our commonest and most universal garden flowers;  yet we see something besides the sympathetic and restful expression  which suggested these names in this flower--a certain suggestion of  demureness, in fact, reminding those who have seen Guido's picture of  the \"Adoration of the Virgin,\" of one of his loveliest angels whose  angelical eyes and face reveal some desire for admiration and love in  the spectator. And that expression, too, of the pansy named  Love-in-Idleness, has been described, coarsely or rudely it may be, in  some of its country names: \"Kiss me behind the garden gate,\" and,  better (or worse) still, \"Meet-her-i'-th'-entry-kiss-her-i'-th'-buttery.\"  Of this order of names are None-so-pretty and Pretty maids, Pretty  Betsy, Kiss-me-quick. Even such a name as Tears of the blood of Christ  does not sound extravagantly fanciful or startling when we look at the  glowing deep golden crimson of the wall flower; nor of a blue flower,  the germander speedwell, such names as The more I see you the more I  love you, and Angels' tears, and Tears of Christ, with many more.    A writer on our wild flowers, in speaking of their vernacular names of  this kind, has said: \"Could we penetrate to the original suggestive  idea that called forth its name, it would bring valuable information  about the first openings of the human mind towards nature; and the  merest dream of such a discovery invests with a strange charm the  words that could tell, if we could understand, so much of the  forgotten infancy of the human race.\"    What a roll of words and what a mighty and mysterious business is here  made of a very simple little matter! It is a charming example of the  strange helplessness, not to say imbecility, which affects most of  those who have been trained in our mind-killing schools; trained not  to think, but taught to go for anything and everything they desire to  know to the books. If the books in the British Museum fail to say why  our ancestors hundreds of years ago named a flower None-so-pretty or  Love-in-a-mist, why then we must be satisfied to sit in thick darkness  with regard to this matter until some heaven-born genius descends to  illuminate us! Yet I daresay there is not a country child who does not  occasionally invent a name for some plant or creature which has  attracted his attention; and in many cases the child's new name is  suggested by some human association in the object--some resemblance to  be seen in form or colour or sound. Not books but the light of nature,  the experience of our own early years, the look which no person not  blinded by reading can fail to see in a flower, is sufficient to  reveal all this hidden wonderful knowledge about the first openings of  the heart towards nature, during the remote infancy of the human race.    From this it will be seen that I am not claiming a discovery; that  what I have called a secret of the charm of flowers is a secret known  to every man, woman, and child, even to those of my own friends who  stoutly deny that they have any such knowledge. But I think it is best  known to children. What I am here doing is merely to bring together  and put in form certain more or less vague thoughts and feelings which  I (and therefore all of us) have about flowers; and it is a small  matter, but it happens to be one which no person has hitherto  attempted.    It may be that in some of my readers' minds--those who, like the  sceptical friends I have mentioned, are not distinctly conscious of  the cause or secret of the expression of a flower--some doubt may  still remain after what has been said of the blue and purple-blue  blossom. Such a doubt ought to disappear when the reds are considered,  and when it is found that the expression peculiar to red flowers  varies infinitely in degree, and is always greatest in those shades of  the colour which come nearest to the most beautiful flesh-tints.    When I say \"beautiful flesh-tints\" I am thinking of the aesthetic  pleasure which we receive from the expression, the associations, of  the red flower. The expression which delights is in the soft and  delicate shades; and in the texture which is sometimes like the  beautiful soft skin; but the expression would exist still in the case  of floral"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#18)"],[1,"number, and are  called Tarante, Muthil, Thidore, Mare, and Matthien; some on this side  some on the other, and some upon the equinoctial line.    \"One produces cloves, another nutmegs, and another cinnamon. All are  near to each other, but small and rather narrow.\"    The world to-day thinks little of spices, for commerce has made common  the luxuries of the Indian Ocean. Cloves, nutmegs, allspice, cinnamon,  ginger are found in every home in all civilized lands, and even children  make few inquiries about them.    This was not so in the early days of the Viceroys of India. Spices which  were gathered and sold by Arabian merchants, were held in Europe as a  gift of Arabia, and esteemed to be the greatest, or among the greatest  of luxuries. A ship laden with spices was hailed in the ports of the  Iberian peninsula as next to a ship freighted with gold, as the Golden  Hynde was welcomed in the days of Sir Francis Drake. It used to be said  that the odors of the spice ships from the East Indies could be breathed  through the breezes that wafted them toward the land.    The principal Spice Islands were the Moluccas, or the islands of the  East India Archipelago between Celebes on the west and New Guinea on the  east, Timor on the south and the open Pacific Sea on the north. They are  distributed over a wide ocean area. Of these the Moluccas form the  principal group. Here are the paradises of the seas.    It was to these islands where could be procured the products of \"Araby  the Blessed\" that Magellan had hoped to find a new way. There were  brighter shores than Spain, and to these he sought the shortest routes  over which ships could travel.    The Peruvian adventurers wished to find gold; the voyagers to the  Antilles, magical waters and new productions of the earth; but  Magellan's dream was of the spiceries of the Indian seas. They all found  what they sought, except Ponce de Leon, who hoped to find the Fountain  of Eternal Youth.    Transylvanus speaks of another wonderful bird that only alighted at  death, and whose feathers were believed to possess magic powers.    \"The kings of Marmin began to believe that souls were immortal a few  years ago, induced by no other argument than that they saw that a  certain most beautiful small bird never rested upon the ground nor upon  anything that grew upon it; but they sometimes saw it fall dead upon the  ground from the sky. And as the Mohammedans, who traveled to those parts  for commercial purposes, told them that this bird was born in Paradise,  and that Paradise was the abode of the souls of those who had died,  these kings (reguli) embraced the sect of Mohammed, because it promised  wonderful things concerning this abode of souls. But they call the bird  Mamuco Diata, and they hold it in such reverence and religious esteem  that they believe that by it their kings are safe in war, even though  they, according to custom, are placed in the forefront of battle.\"    He continues his narrative:    \"But, our men having carefully inspected the position of the Moluccas  and of each separate island, and also having inquired about the habits  of the kings, went to Thedori, because they learnt, that in that island  the supply of cloves was far above that of the others, and that its King  also surpassed the other kings in wisdom and humanity. So, having  prepared their gifts they land, and salute the King, and they offer the  presents as if they had been sent by Caesar. He, having received the  presents kindly, looks up to Heaven, and says:    \"'I have known now for two years from the course of the stars, that you  were coming to seek these lands, sent by the most mighty King of Kings.  Wherefore your coming is the more pleasant and grateful to me, as I had  been forewarned of it by the signification of the stars.    \"'And, as I know that nothing ever happens to any man which has not been  fixed long before by the decree of fate and the stars, I will not be the  one to attempt to withstand either the fates or the signification of the  stars, but willingly and of good cheer, will henceforth lay aside the  royal pomp and will consider myself as managing the administration of  this island only in the name of your King. Wherefore draw your ships  into port, and order the rest of your comrades to land; so that now at  last, after such a long tossing upon the seas, and so many dangers, you  may enjoy the pleasures of the land and refresh your bodies. And think  not but that you have arrived at your King's kingdom.'    \"Having said this, the King, laying aside his crown, embraced them one  by one, and ordered whatever food that land afforded to be brought. Our  men being overjoyed at this, returned to their comrades, and told them  what had happened. They, pleased above measure with the friendly  behavior and kindness of the King, take possession of the island. And  when their health was completely restored, in a few days, by the King's  munificence, they sent envoys to the other kings, to examine the wealth  of the islands, and to conciliate the other kings.\"    His description of the clove trees is very pleasing:    \"Tirante was the nearest, and also the smallest, of the islands; for it  has a circumference of a little more than six Italian miles. Matthien is  next to it, and it, too, is small. These three produce a great quantity  of cloves, but more every fourth year than the other three. These trees  only grow on steep rocks, and that so thickly as frequently to form a  grove. This tree is very like a laurel (or bay tree) in leaf, closeness  of growth, and height; and the gariophile, which they call clove from  its likeness to a nail (clavus), grows on the tip of each separate twig.  First a bud, and then a flower, just like the orange flower is produced.    \"The pointed part of the clove is fixed at the extreme end of the  branch, and then growing slightly longer, it forms a spike. It is at  first red, but soon gets black by the heat of the sun. The natives keep  the plantations of these trees separate, as we do our vines. They bury  the cloves in pits till they are taken away by the traders.\"    He also describes the cinnamon tree:    \"Muthil, the fourth island, is not larger than the rest, and it produces  cinnamon. The tree is full of shoots, and in other respects barren; it  delights in dryness, and is very like the tree which bears pomegranates.  The bark of this splits under the influence of the sun's heat, and is  stripped off the wood; and, after drying a little in the sun, it is  cinnamon.\"    Also the nutmeg tree:    \"Near to this is another island, called Bada, larger and more ample than  the Moluccas. In this grows the nutmeg, the tree of which is tall and  spreading, and is rather like the walnut tree, and its nut, too, grows  like the walnut; for it is protected by a double husk, at first like a  furry calix, and under this a thin membrane, which embraces the nutlike  network. This is called the Muscat flower with us, but by the Spaniards  mace, and is a noble and wholesome spice. The other covering is a woody  shell, like that of a hazelnut, and in that, as we have already said, is  the nutmeg.\"    And ginger:    \"Ginger grows here and there in each of the islands of the archipelago.  It sometimes grows by sowing, and sometimes spontaneously; but that  which is sown is the more valuable. Its grass is like that of the  saffron, and its root is almost the same too, and that is ginger.\"    While sailing among these bowery ocean gardens, and gathering their  odorous products, the poetic Maximilianus was presented with one of the  immortal birds that protected a hero in battle, \"the bird of God.\"    He thus speaks of the rare present:    \"Our men were kindly treated by the chiefs in turn, and they, too,  submitted freely to the rule of Caesar, like the King of Thidori. But the  Spaniards, who had but two ships, resolved to bring some of each  (spice) home, but to load the ships with cloves, because the crop of  that was the most abundant that year, and our ships could contain a  greater quantity of this kind of spice. Having, therefore, loaded the  ships with cloves, and having received letters and presents for Caesar  from the Kings, they make ready for their departure. The letters were  full of submission and respect. The gifts were Indian swords, and things  of that sort. But, best of all, the Mamuco Diata; that is, the bird of  God, by which they believe themselves to be safe and invincible in  battle. Of which five were sent, and one I obtained from the Captain  (_congran prieghi_), which I send to your reverence, not that your  reverence may think yourself safe from treachery and the sword by means  of it, as they profess to do, but that you may be pleased with its  rareness and beauty. I send also some cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves, to  show that our spices are not only not worse, but more valuable than  those which the Venetians and Portuguese bring, because they are  fresher.\"    He also relates the disasters which fell to one of the overloaded ships:    \"When our men had set sail from Thedori, one of the ships, and that the  larger one, having sprung a leak, began to make water, so that it became  necessary to put back to Thedori. When the Spaniards saw that this  mischief could not be remedied without great labor and much time, they  agreed that the other ship should sail to the Cape of Cattigara, and  afterward through the deep as far as possible from the coast of India,  lest it should be seen by the Portuguese, and until they saw the  promontory of Africa which projects beyond the tropic of Capricorn, and  to which the Portuguese have given the name of Good Hope; and from that  point the passage to Spain would be easy.    \"But as soon as the other ship was refitted it should direct its course  through the archipelago, and that vast ocean toward the shores of the  continent which we mentioned before, till it found that coast which was  in the"]]]
