In leaving 'Sordello' we emerge from the self-conscious stage of Mr.  Browning's imagination, and his work ceases to be autobiographic in the  sense in which, perhaps erroneously, we have hitherto felt it to be.  'Festus' and 'Salinguerra' have already given promise of the world of  'Men and Women' into which he will now conduct us. They will be inspired  by every variety of conscious motive, but never again by the old (real  or imagined) self-centred, self-directing Will. We have, indeed, already  lost the sense of disparity between the man and the poet; for the  Browning of 'Sordello' was growing older, while the defects of the poem  were in many respects those of youth. In 'Pippa Passes', published one  year later, the poet and the man show themselves full-grown. Each has  entered on the inheritance of the other.    Neither the imagination nor the passion of what Mr. Gosse so fitly calls  this 'lyrical masque'* gives much scope for tenderness; but the quality  of humour is displayed in it for the first time; as also a strongly  marked philosophy of life--or more properly, of association--from  which its idea and development are derived. In spite, however, of these  evidences of general maturity, Mr. Browning was still sometimes boyish  in personal intercourse, if we may judge from a letter to Miss Flower  written at about the same time.         * These words, and a subsequent paragraph, are quoted from       Mr. Gosse's 'Personalia'.      Monday night, March 9 (? 1841).    My dear Miss Flower,--I have this moment received your very kind  note--of course, I understand your objections. How else? But they are  somewhat lightened already (confess--nay 'confess' is vile--you will  be rejoiced to holla from the house-top)--will go on, or rather go  off, lightening, and will be--oh, where _will_ they be half a dozen years  hence?    Meantime praise what you can praise, do me all the good you can, you and  Mr. Fox (as if you will not!) for I have a head full of projects--mean  to song-write, play-write forthwith,--and, believe me, dear Miss Flower,  Yours ever faithfully, Robert Browning.    By the way, you speak of 'Pippa'--could we not make some arrangement  about it? The lyrics _want_ your music--five or six in all--how say you?  When these three plays are out I hope to build a huge Ode--but 'all  goeth by God's Will.'      The loyal Alfred Domett now appears on the scene with a satirical poem,  inspired by an impertinent criticism on his friend. I give its first two  verses:      On a Certain Critique on 'Pippa Passes'.    (Query--Passes what?--the critic's comprehension.)         Ho! everyone that by the nose is led,       Automatons of which the world is full,       Ye myriad bodies, each without a head,       That dangle from a critic's brainless skull,       Come, hearken to a deep discovery made,       A mighty truth now wondrously displayed.         A black squat beetle, vigorous for his size,       Pushing tail-first by every road that's wrong       The dung-ball of his dirty thoughts along       His tiny sphere of grovelling sympathies--       Has knocked himself full-butt, with blundering trouble,       Against a mountain he can neither double       Nor ever hope to scale.  So like a free,       Pert, self-conceited scarabaeus, he       Takes it into his horny head to swear       There's no such thing as any mountain there.    The writer lived to do better things from a literary point of view; but  these lines have a fine ring of youthful indignation which must have  made them a welcome tribute to friendship.    There seems to have been little respectful criticism of 'Pippa Passes';  it is less surprising that there should have been very little of  'Sordello'. Mr. Browning, it is true, retained a limited number of  earnest appreciators, foremost of whom was the writer of an admirable  notice of these two works, quoted from an 'Eclectic Review' of 1847, in  Dr. Furnivall's 'Bibliography'. I am also told that the series of poems  which was next to appear was enthusiastically greeted by some poets  and painters of the pre-Raphaelite school; but he was now entering on  a period of general neglect, which covered nearly twenty years of his  life, and much that has since become most deservedly popular in his  work.    'Pippa Passes' had appeared as the first instalment of 'Bells and  Pomegranates', the history of which I give in Mr. Gosse's words. This  poem, and the two tragedies, 'King Victor and King Charles' and 'The  Return of the Druses'--first christened 'Mansoor, the Hierophant'--were  lying idle in Mr. Browning's desk. He had not found, perhaps not very  vigorously sought, a publisher for them.      'One day, as the poet was discussing the matter with Mr. Edward Moxon,  the publisher, the latter remarked that at that time he was bringing out  some editions of the old Elizabethan dramatists in a comparatively  cheap form, and that if Mr. Browning would consent to print his poems  as pamphlets, using this cheap type, the expense would be very  inconsiderable. The poet jumped at the idea, and it was agreed that each  poem should form a separate brochure of just one sheet--sixteen pages  in double columns--the entire cost of which should not exceed twelve or  fifteen pounds. In this fashion began the celebrated series of 'Bells  and Pomegranates', eight numbers of which, a perfect treasury of fine  poetry, came out successively between 1841 and 1846. 'Pippa Passes'  led the way, and was priced first at sixpence; then, the sale being  inconsiderable, at a shilling, which greatly encouraged the sale;  and so, slowly, up to half-a-crown, at which the price of each number  finally rested.'      Mr. Browning's hopes and intentions with respect to this series are  announced in the following preface to 'Pippa Passes', of which, in later  editions, only the dedicatory words appear:      'Two or three years ago I wrote a Play, about which the chief matter I  care to recollect at present is, that a Pit-full of good-natured people  applauded it:--ever since, I have been desirous of doing something in  the same way that should better reward their attention. What follows  I mean for the first of a series of Dramatical Pieces, to come out at  intervals, and I amuse myself by fancying that the cheap mode in which  they appear will for once help me to a sort of Pit-audience again.  Of course, such a work must go on no longer than it is liked; and to  provide against a certain and but too possible contingency, let me  hasten to say now--what, if I were sure of success, I would try to say  circumstantially enough at the close--that I dedicate my best intentions  most admiringly to the author of \"Ion\"--most affectionately to Serjeant  Talfourd.'      A necessary explanation of the general title was reserved for the last  number: and does something towards justifying the popular impression  that Mr. Browning exacted a large measure of literary insight from his  readers.      'Here ends my first series of \"Bells and Pomegranates\": and I take the  opportunity of explaining, in reply to inquiries, that I only meant  by that title to indicate an endeavour towards something like an  alternation, or mixture, of music with discoursing, sound with sense,  poetry with thought; which looks too ambitious, thus expressed, so the  symbol was preferred. It is little to the purpose, that such is  actually one of the most familiar of the many Rabbinical (and Patristic)  acceptations of the phrase; because I confess that, letting authority  alone, I supposed the bare words, in such juxtaposition, would  sufficiently convey the desired meaning. \"Faith and good works\" is  another fancy, for instance, and perhaps no easier to arrive at: yet  Giotto placed a pomegranate fruit in the hand of Dante, and Raffaelle  crowned his Theology (in the 'Camera della Segnatura') with blossoms of  the same; as if the Bellari and Vasari would be sure to come after,  and explain that it was merely \"simbolo delle buone opere--il qual  Pomogranato fu pero usato nelle vesti del Pontefice appresso gli  Ebrei.\"'      The Dramas and Poems contained in the eight numbers of 'Bells and  Pomegranates' were:        I.

He saw her in mid-winter, hurrying out,  A slim shawled figure through the drifted snow,  To help him; saw her fall with a stifled cry,  Gashing herself upon that buried hook,  And struggling up, out of the blood-stained drift,  To greet him with a smile.                             \"For any soldier,  This wound,\" the surgeon muttered, \"would have meant  Six weeks in hospital.\"                          Not six days for her!  \"I am glad these nights were cloudy, and we lost  So little,\" was all she said.                               Sir John pulled out  Another stop. A little ironical march  Of flutes began to goose-step through the gloom.  He saw that first \"success\"! Ay, call it so!  The royal command,--the court desires to see  The planet Saturn and his marvellous rings  On Friday night. The skies, on Friday night,  Were black with clouds. \"Canute me no Canutes,\"  Muttered their new magician, and unpacked  His telescope. \"You shall see what you can see.\"  He levelled it through a window; and they saw  \"Wonderful! Marvellous! Glorious! Eh, what, what!\"  A planet of paper, with a paper ring,  Lit by a lamp, in a hollow of Windsor Park,  Among the ferns, where Herne the Hunter walks,  And Falstaff found that fairies live on cheese.  Thus all were satisfied; while, above the clouds--  The thunder of the pedals reaffirmed--  The Titan planet, every minute, rolled  Three hundred leagues upon his awful way.  Then, through that night, the _vox humana_spoke  With deeper longing than Lucretius knew  When, in his great third book, the somber chant  Kindled and soared on those exultant wings,  Praising the master's hand from which he, too,  --Father, discoverer, hero--caught the fire.  It spoke of those vast labours, incomplete,  But, through their incompletion, infinite  In beauty, and in hope; the task bequeathed  From dying hand to hand.                           Close to his grave  Like a _memento mori_ stood the hulk  Of that great weapon rusted and outworn,  Which once broke down the barriers of the sky.  _\"Perrupit claustra\"_; yes, and bridged their gulfs;  For, far beyond our solar scheme, it showed  The law that bound our planets binding still  Those coupled suns which year by year he watched  Around each other circling.                              Had our own  Some distant comrade, lost among the stars?  Should we not, one day, just as Kepler drew  His planetary music and its laws  From all those faithful records Tycho made,  Discern at last what vaster music rules  The vaster drift of stars from deep to deep;  Around what awful Poles, those wisps of light  Those fifteen hundred universes move?  One signal, even now, across the dark,  Declared their worlds confederate with our own;  For, carrying many secrets, which we now  Slowly decipher, one swift messenger comes  Across the abyss...  The light that, flashing through the immeasurable,  From universe to universe proclaims  The single reign of law that binds them all.  We shall break up those rays and, in their lines  And colours, read the history of their stars.  Year after year, the slow sure records grow.  Awaiting their interpreter. They shall see it,  Our sons, in that far day, the swift, the strong,  The triumphing young-eyed runners with the torch.    No deep-set boundary-mark in Space or Time  Shall halt or daunt them. Who that once has seen  How truth leads on to truth, shall ever dare  To set a bound to knowledge?                               \"Would that he knew\"  --So thought the visitant at that shadowy shrine--  \"Even as the maker of a song can hear  With the soul's ear, far off, the unstricken chords  To which, by its own inner law, it climbs,  Would that my father knew how younger hands  Completed his own planetary tune;  How from the planet that his own eyes found  The mind of man would plunge into the dark,  And, blindfold, find without the help of eyes  A mightier planet, in the depths beyond.\"    Then, while the reeds, with quiet melodious pace  Followed the dream, as in a picture passed,  Adams, the boy at Cambridge, making his vow  By that still lamp, alone in that deep night,  Beneath the crumbling battlements of St. John's,  To know why Uranus, uttermost planet known,  Moved in a rhythm delicately astray  From all the golden harmonies ordained  By those known measures of its sister-worlds.  Was there an unknown planet, far beyond,  Sailing through unimaginable deeps  And drawing it from its path?                                Then challenging chords  Echoed the prophecy that Sir John had made,  Guided by his own faith in Newton's law:  _We have not found it, but we feel it trembling  Along the lines of our analysis now  As once Columbus, from the shores of Spain,  Felt the new continent._                              Then, in swift fugues, began  A race between two nations for the prize  Of that new world.                     Le Verrier in France,  Adams in England, each of them unaware  Of his own rival, at the selfsame hour  Resolved to find it.                       Not by the telescope now!  Skies might be swept for aeons ere one spark  Among those myriads were both found and seen  To move, at that vast distance round our sun.  They worked by faith in law alone. They knew  The wanderings of great Uranus, and they knew  The law of Newton.                     By the midnight lamp,  Pencil in hand, shut in a four-walled room,  Each by pure thought must work his problem out,--  Given that law, to find the mass and place  Of that which drew their planet from his course.    There were no throngs to applaud them. Each alone,  Without the heat of conflict laboured on,  Consuming brain and nerve; for throngs applaud  Only the flash and tinsel of their day,  Never the quiet runners with the torch.  Night after night they laboured. Line on line  Of intricate figures, moving all in law,  They marshalled. Their long columns formed and marched  From battle to battle, and no sound was heard  Of victory or defeat. They marched through snows  Bleak as the drifts that broke Napoleon's pride  And through a vaster desert. They drilled their hosts  With that divine precision of the mind  To which one second's error in a year  Were anarchy, that precision which is felt  Throbbing through music.                           Month on month they toiled,  With worlds for ciphers. One rich autumn night  Brooding over his figures there alone  In Cambridge, Adams found them moving all  To one solution. To the unseeing eye  His long neat pages had no more to tell  Than any merchant's ledger, yet they shone  With epic splendour, and like trumpets pealed;  _Three hundred million leagues beyond the path  Of our remotest planet, drowned in night  Another and a mightier planet rolls;  In volume, fifty times more vast than earth,  And of so huge an orbit that its year  Wellnigh outlasts our nations. Though it moves  A thousand leagues an hour, it has not ranged  Thrice through its seasons since Columbus sailed,  Or more than once since Galileo died._    He took his proofs to Greenwich. \"Sweep the skies  Within this limited region now,\" he said.  \"You'll find your moving planet. I'm not more  Than one degree in error.\"                             He left his proofs;  But Airy, king of Greenwich, looked askance  At unofficial genius in the young,  And pigeon-holed that music of the spheres.  Nine months he waited till Le Verrier, too,  Pointed to that same region of the sky.  Then Airy, opening his big sleepy lids,  Bade Challis use his telescope,--too late,  To make that honour all his country's own;  For all Le Verrier's proofs were now with Galle  Who, being German, had his star-charts ready  And, in that region, found one needlepoint  Had moved. A monster planet!                               Honour to France!  Honour to England, too, the cry began,  Who found it also, though she drowsed at Greenwich.  So--as the French said, with some sting in it--  \"We gave the name of Neptune to our prize  Because our neighbour England rules the sea.\"  \"Honour to all,\" say we; for, in these wars,  Whoever wins a battle wins for all.  But, most of all, honour to him who found  The law that was a lantern to their feet,--  Newton, the first whose thought could soar beyond  The bounds of human vision and declare,  \"Thus saith the law of Nature and of God  Concerning things invisible.\"                                This new world  What was it but one harmony the more  In that great music which himself had heard,--  The chant of those reintegrated spheres  Moving around their sun, while all things moved  Around one deeper Light, revealed by law,  Beyond all vision, past all understanding.  Yet darkly shadowed forth for dreaming men  On earth in music...                       Music, all comes back  To music in the end.                       Then, in the gloom  Of the Octagon Chapel, the dreamer lifted up  His face, as if to all those great forebears.  The quivering organ rolled upon the dusk  His dream of that new symphony,--the sun  Chanting to all his planets on their way  While, stop to stop replying, height o'er height,  His planets answered, voices of a dream:    THE SUN      Light, on the far faint planets that attend me!      Light! But for me-the fury and the fire.    My white-hot maelstroms, the red storms that rend me      Can yield them still the harvest they desire,      I kiss with light their sunward-lifted faces.      With dew-drenched flowers I crown their dusky brows.    They praise me, lightly, from their pleasant places.      Their birds belaud me, lightly, from their boughs.      And men, on lute and lyre, have breathed their pleasure.      They have watched Apollo's golden chariot roll;    Hymned his bright wheels, but never mine that measure      A million leagues of flame from Pole to Pole.      Like harbour-lights the stars grow wide before me,      I draw my worlds ten thousand leagues a day.    Their far blue"]]]
