Their  armour, accoutrement, and drill thus became more complicated;  men-at-arms and lances were considered the only effective troops. But  their efficiency was counteracted by another result of stipendiary  warfare. Exempt from enthusiasm in any cause, their tactics became a  money question. To close a campaign by a series of brilliant successes  was to kill the goose that gave them the golden eggs: to carry havoc  into the adverse ranks was damaging to those who might be their next  paymasters or comrades. Sanguinary conflicts brought them danger  without advantage, whilst the capture of an opponent or a camp ensured  for them a rich prize. War was, in fact, a game which they were paid  to play, with no interest in the stakes beyond their individual  opportunities of plunder. Equally indifferent to past victories or  future fame, they cared little for beating the enemy, could they but  reach his baggage-waggons, or temporise until he could buy them off.  Battles, thus deprived of their dangers and stirring incidents, became  great prize-fights, in which the victors deserved no sympathy, and the  conquered required no commiseration. Gain was substituted for glory,  languor for gallantry, calculation for courage. Patriotism slumbered;  honesty of purpose and energy of action fell into disuse; the parties  in the match, careless of victory, manoeuvred only for stalemate.  Hence the political results of Italian campaigns were inconsiderable,  compared with the forces in the field, the time consumed, and the  resources expended. Impoverished states were generally left without  defenders and even wealthy belligerents were liable to a sudden and  immediate desertion by their hireling bands. Still more fatal were the  moral effects upon the people. The feudal system rendered every  occupier of the soil a soldier, ready to stand by his king and  country; and it transmitted to more peaceful times \"a bold peasantry,  their country's pride\" and best defenders. But it was otherwise with  the brave spirits of the Ausonian commonwealths; they were bound to  the banner of some privileged bandit, who served the best bidder,  whilst the mass of the community became indifferent to a native land  for which they were never called upon to hazard life or limb. The  stipendiaries fought for or against freedom, faith, country, and  comrades; the citizens endured their outrage or purchased their mercy.  In the end, the military were brutalised, whilst the civilians became  enervated. The former were made venal, the latter cowardly. The  master-mind of Machiavelli, after the French invasions of 1492-9, saw  these mischiefs, and would have remedied them by his plan for a civic  militia; but it was too late, and the degeneracy engrafted upon the  national character of Italy by the condottiere system still cankers it  to the core.           *       *       *       *       *    Although the states which grew up under these varying circumstances  are universally known as the Italian Republics, this phrase is  scarcely correct in our idiom. The leading peculiarity of mediaeval  Italy was the separate sovereignty of its petty principalities, and  towns of minor rank, in which democratic constitutions were but  incidental and transient distinctions, progressively disappearing as  the dark ages were succeeded by a cycle of golden radiance. The  Italian Republics might, therefore, be more aptly named the Italian  Communes or Commonwealths. This misnomer has also given rise to  somewhat confused views regarding the amount of liberty enjoyed in  these states, especially since their history has become known to us  from the pen of one whose democratic prepossessions, though clothed in  eloquence, are so tempered by benevolent philosophy as those of  Sismondi.    Liberty is a word of vague signification, both as to quality and  degree. In a political sense, it has at least three meanings: personal  freedom, self-government, national independence. Let us test the  application of each of these qualities to the Italian commonwealths.  Neither in them nor in any contemporary state, was freedom of person  known in name or in fact. Individuals had no guarantee against  oppression by their rulers, nor security from their powerful  neighbours; no great charter constituted for them a claim of right to  personal protection. In this respect there was little difference  between the subjects of a petty autocrat and those of a democratic  faction,--between the tyranny of one or of many: but in Venice, that  most prosperous and permanent of all the commonwealths, which Roscoe,  by a happy antithesis, has described as a \"republic of nobles with a  populace of slaves,\" and which especially arrogated _the_ republic as  its title, individual safety was at the lowest grade.    In most of the communities, self-government, or the sovereignty of the  people, had scarcely a reality as regarded the masses. Under the  seigneurs, when the hereditary principle was weak, it was oftener  supplemented or infringed by the sword than by the popular will. In  the few commonwealths which, during the fifteenth century, preserved  their democratic institutions, such as Florence and Siena, the guilds  and companies constituted indeed a quasi-representative system; but  these had generally fallen into the hands of privileged classes, and  even the shadow of power which clung to them was constantly torn away  by some ambitious burgher, or misused for the extermination of a rival  faction. Indeed, the most liberal of their constitutions corresponded  in the main to our own municipal machinery, limiting the privileges of  self-government to certain classes in the cities, and entirely  excluding from them the rural population. The value at which these  privileges were held may be estimated by the indifference of  immediately adjacent despotic states, whether languishing under the  savage tyranny of a Malatesta,[*15] or enjoying the beneficent sway of  a Montefeltro. Even when, outraged beyond endurance, they rose against  their oppressors, it was much more frequently to set up a new  autocrat, than to seize for themselves power which the example of  their democratic neighbours appears to have invested with no charm. We  may therefore fairly conclude that the self-governed citizens of  Ancona, Assisi, and San Marino, enjoyed no envied advantages over  those of the surrounding principalities, which unquestionably outshone  them in historical and literary illustration.    [Footnote *15: The Malatesti were, without doubt, just as great and  beloved as the Montefeltri. Sigismondo was as great and enthusiastic a  patron of the arts, and in contemporary opinion a greater soldier than  Federigo di Montefeltro. See EDWARD HUTTON, _op. cit._, p. 86 note 1.]    Since, then, the peculiar quality which infused extraordinary mental  vigour into the Italian commonwealths, and imparted to them a social  influence beyond their real importance, consisted neither in personal  security nor in self-sovereignty, it must have chiefly depended upon  the only remaining description of freedom, their nationality. By this  phrase we mean not that mere independence of foreign and barbarian  sway, which it was long the papal policy to vindicate by oceans of  blood and treasure, but the maintenance in each community of a  separate and supreme political status, frequently co-existent with  municipal franchises and local administration, but always  irresponsible to neighbours or to nominal over-lords, whether emperor  or pope. The elevation of sentiment which such a position infused,  both into communities and individuals, forms the noblest feature in  Italian mediaeval history. The honours, the privileges, and the  responsibilities of citizenship were thus maintained in more immediate  contact with those of the commonwealth, whereof the humblest might  boast himself a participator. Besides this, there ensued many  advantages of a more material description. By giving each small state  its own capital, the wealth and patronage belonging to a seat of  government, and in most instances to a court, were secured for it. The  residence of its sovereign and officials retained in home circulation  not only the revenues of the principality, but the income drawn by him  from foreign fiefs and from military adventures. It kept up a  permanent aristocracy of talent and genius as well as of rank and  wealth, such as it was the pride of most of these courts to encourage  and protect. The practical operation of these causes may be  illustrated from the condition of Romagna and La Marca during the  fifteenth century. About one half of the present papal territory there  was then divided among the following independent states:--      Ferrara,          held as a   Marquisate   by the   d'Este.

Or perhaps  their notion of regal prerogative, which extended so far as to admit its  right to mould the national law at its good pleasure, might go the  further length of ascribing to it a controlling power over the moral  statutes of right and wrong, and of pleading its sanction against the  menaces of Master Stubs. Or it may be that Master Stubs had failed to  convince them that they were wrong, even without an appeal to the royal  dispensation. Certain it is that, in spite of all that Master Stubs and  his brethren could say, the sway of the Lord of Misrule, and the revels  of his court continued to flourish with increasing splendor during this  reign, and, as we have seen, lost no portion of their magnificence  during the two next, although in that time had arisen the great champion  of the Puritans, Prynne, and against them and their practices had been  directed whole volumes of vituperation, and denounced large vials of  wrath.    In Scotland, however, where the reformation took a sterner tone than in  the southern kingdom, and where, as we have said, the irregularities  committed under cover of the Christmas and other ceremonials laid them  more justly open to its censure, the effect of this outcry was earlier  and far more sensibly felt; and even so early as the reign of Queen Mary  an act passed the Scottish Parliament whereby the Abbot of Unreason and  all his \"merrie disports\" were suppressed.    In England, it is true that, according to Sandys, an order of the common  council had issued as early as the beginning of _our_ Mary's reign  prohibiting the Lord Mayor or Sheriffs from entertaining a Lord of  Misrule in any of their houses; but this appears to have been merely on  financial grounds, with a view of reducing the corporation expenditure,  and to have extended no further.    It was not, however, until after the breaking out of the Civil War that  the persecution of the Puritans (who had long and zealously labored not  only to resolve the various ceremonials of the season into their pagan  elements, but even to prove that the celebration of the Nativity at all  was in itself idolatrous) succeeded to any extent in producing that  result which the war itself and the consequent disorganization of  society must in a great measure have effected even without the aid of a  fanatical outcry. In the very first year of that armed struggle the  earliest successful blow was struck against the festivities with which  it had been usual to celebrate this period of the year, in certain  ordinances which were issued for suppressing the performance of plays  and other diversions; and in the following year some of the shops in  London were for the first time opened on Christmas day, in obedience to  the feelings which connected any observance of it with the spirit of  popery. By the year 1647 the Puritans had so far prevailed that in  various places the parish officers were subjected to penalties for  encouraging the decking of churches and permitting divine service to be  performed therein on Christmas morning; and in the same year the  observance of the festival itself, with that of other holidays, was  formally abolished by the two branches of the legislature.    It was found impossible, however, by all these united means, to  eradicate the Christmas spirit from the land; and many of its customs  and festivities continued to be observed, not only in obscure places,  but even in towns, in spite of prohibition and in spite of the  disarrangement of social ties. The contest between the Puritan spirit  and the ancient spirit of celebration led to many contests; and we have  an account--in a little book of which we have seen a copy in the  British Museum, entitled \"Canterbury Christmas, or a True Relation of  the Insurrection in Canterbury\"--of the disturbances which ensued in  that city upon the Mayor's proclamation, issued in consequence of that  Parliamentary prohibition at the Christmas which followed. This said  proclamation, it appears, which was made by the city crier, was to the  effect \"that Christmas day and all other superstitious festivals should  be put downe and that a market should be kept upon Christmas day.\" This  order, it goes on to state, was \"very ill taken by the country,\" the  people of which neglected to bring their provisions into the town, and  gave other tokens of their displeasure of a less negative kind. For, a  few of the shopkeepers in the city, \"to the number of twelve at the  most,\" having ventured to open their shops in defiance of the general  feeling, \"they were commanded by the multitude to shut up again; but  refusing to obey, their ware was thrown up and down and they at last  forced to shut in.\"    Nor were the revilings of the Puritans against the lovers of Christmas  observances suffered to remain unanswered. Many a squib was directed  against the Roundheads; and the popular regret for the suppression of  their high festival was skilfully appealed to by Royalist politicians  and favorers of the ancient religion. The connection between the new  condition of things in Church and State and the extinction of all the  merriment of the land was carefully suggested in publications that  stole out in spite of penalties and were read in defiance of  prohibitions. As an example, that curious little tract from which we  have more than once quoted under the title of \"An Hue and Cry after  Christmas,\" bears the date of 1645; and we shall best give our readers  an idea of its character by setting out that title at length, as the  same exhibits a tolerable abstract of its contents. It runs thus: \"The  arraignment, conviction, and imprisoning of Christmas on St. Thomas day  last, and how he broke out of prison in the holidayes and got away,  onely left his hoary hair and gray beard sticking between two iron bars  of a window. With an Hue and Cry after Christmas, and a letter from Mr.  Woodcock, a fellow in Oxford, to a malignant lady in London. And divers  passages between the lady and the cryer about Old Christmas; and what  shift he was fain to make to save his life, and great stir to fetch him  back again. Printed by Simon Minc'd Pye for Cissely Plum-Porridge, and  are to be sold by Ralph Fidler Chandler at the signe of the Pack of  Cards in Mustard Alley in Brawn Street.\" Besides the allusions contained  in the latter part of this title to some of the good things that follow  in the old man's train, great pains are taken by the \"cryer\" in  describing him, and by the lady in mourning for him, to allude to many  of the cheerful attributes that made him dear to the people. His great  antiquity and portly appearance are likewise insisted upon. \"For age  this hoarie-headed man was of great yeares, and as white as snow. He  entered the Romish Kallendar, time out of mind, as old or very neer as  Father Mathusalem was,--one that looked fresh in the Bishops' time,  though their fall made him pine away ever since. He was full and fat as  any divine doctor on them all; he looked under the consecrated lawne  sleeves as big as Bul-beefe,--just like Bacchus upon a tunne of wine,  when the grapes hang shaking about his eares; but since the Catholike  liquor is taken from him he is much wasted, so that he hath looked very  thin and ill of late.\" \"The poor,\" says the \"cryer\" to the lady, \"are  sory for\" his departure; \"for they go to every door a-begging, as they  were wont to do (_good Mrs., Somewhat against this good time_); but Time  was transformed, _Away, be gone; here is not for you_.\" The lady,  however, declares that she for one will not be deterred from welcoming  old Christmas. \"No, no!\" says she; \"bid him come by night over the  Thames, and we will have a back-door open to let him in;\" and ends by  anticipating better prospects for him another year.    And by many a back-door was the old man let in to many a fireside during  the heaviest times of all that persecution and disgrace. On the  establishment of the Commonwealth, when the more settled state of things  removed some of the causes which had opposed themselves to his due  reception, the contests of opposition between the revived spirit of  festival and the increased sectarian austerity became more conspicuous.  There is an order of the Parliament in 1652 again prohibiting the  observance of Christmas day, which proves that the practice had revived;  and there are examples of the military having been employed to disperse  congregations assembled for that purpose. In the \"Vindication of  Christmas,\" published about this time, the old gentleman,"]]]
