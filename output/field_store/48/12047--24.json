At length, having searched in vain for any other signs of the colonists,  the English returned to the ships and set sail for Croatoan.    But now they encountered terrible storms.  Their ships were battered  this way and that, their sails were torn, their anchors lost.  And  at length in spite of all entreaties, the captain resolved to make  sail for England.  So John White never saw Croatoan, never knew what  had become of his dear ones.  And what happened to little Virginia  Dare, the first English girl to be born on the soil of the United  States, will never be known.  But years afterwards settlers were  told by the Indians that the white people left at Roanoke had gone  to live among the Indians.  For some years it was said they lived  in a friendly manner together.  In time, however, the medicine men  began to hate the Pale-faces, and caused them all to be slain,  except four men, one young woman, and three boys.  Was the young  woman perhaps Virginia Dare? No one can tell.    All Raleigh's attempts at founding a colony had thus come to nothing.  Still he did not despair.  Once again he sent out an expedition.  But  that too failed and the leader returned having done nothing.  Even  this did not break Raleigh's faith in the future of Virginia. \"I  shall yet live to see it an English nation,\" he said.    But although Raleigh's faith was as firm as before, his money was  gone.  He had spent enormous sums on his fruitless efforts to found  a colony.  Now he had no more to spend.    And now great changes came.  Good Queen Bess died and James of Scotland  reigned in her stead.  Raleigh fell into disgrace, was imprisoned  in the Tower, and after a short release was beheaded there.  Thus  an end came to all his splendid schemes.  Never before perhaps had  such noble devotion to King and country been so basely requited.  At the time it was said that \"never before was English justice so  injured or so disgraced\" as by the sentence of death passed upon  Raleigh.  No man is perfect, nor was Raleigh perfect.  But he was  a great man, and although all his plans failed we remember him as  the first great coloniser, the first Englishman to gain possession  of any part of North America.    PART II STORIES OF VIRGINIA    __________            Chapter 13 - The Adventures of Captain John Smith          Raleigh was the true father of England beyond the seas.  He was a  great statesman and patriot.  But he was a dreamer too and all his  schemes failed.  Other men followed him who likewise failed.  But  it would take too long to tell of them all, of Bartholomew Gosnold  who discovered and named Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod; of Bartholomew  Gilbert, brave Sir Humphrey's son, who was slain by Indians, and  of many more besides.    Again and again men tried to plant a colony on the shores of  America.  Again and again they failed.  But with British doggedness  they went on trying, and at length succeeded.    Raleigh lay in the Tower of London, a prisoner accused of treason.  All his lands were taken from him.  Virginia, which had been granted  to him by Queen Elizabeth was the King's once more to give to whom  he would.  So now two companies were formed, one of London merchants  called the London Company, one of Plymouth merchants called the  Plymouth Company.  And both these companies prayed King James to grant  them permission to found colonies in Virginia.  Virginia therefore  was divided into two parts; the right to found colonies in the  southern half being given to the London Company, the right to found  colonies in the northern half being given to the Plymouth Company  upon condition that the colonies founded must be one hundred miles  distant from each other.    These companies were formed by merchants.  They were formed for  trade, and in the hope of making money, in spite of the fact that  up to this time no man had made money by trying to found colonies.  in America, but on the contrary many had lost fortunes.    Of the two companies now formed it was only the London Company  which really did anything.  The Plymouth Company indeed sent out an  expedition which reached Virginia.  But the colony was a failure,  and after a year of hardships the colonists set sail for England  taking home with them such doleful accounts of their sufferings  that none who heard them ever wished to help to found a colony.    The expedition of the London Company had a better fate.  It was in  December, 1606, that the little fleet of three ships, the Susan  Constant, the Godspeed and the Discovery, put out from England,  and turned westward towards the New World.    With the expedition sailed Captain John Smith.  He was bronzed and  bearded like a Turk, a swaggering, longheaded lovable sort of man,  ambitious, too, and not given to submit his will to others.  Since  a boy of sixteen he had led a wandering adventurous life - a life  cramful of heroic deeds, of hairbreadth escapes of which we have  no space to tell here.  But I hope some day you will read his own  story of these days.  For he was a writer as well as a warrior, and  \"what his sword did his pen wrote.\" Every American boy and girl  should read his story, for he has been called the first American  writer.    Now with this saucy, swaggering fellow on board, troubles were not  far to seek.  The voyage was long and tedious.  For six weeks adverse  winds kept the little fleet prisoner in the English Channel within  sight of English shores, a thing trying to the tempers of men used  to action, and burning with impatience to reach the land beyond  the seas.  They lay idle with nothing to do but talk.  So they fell  to discussing matters about the colony they were to found.  And from  discussing they fell to disputing until it ended at length in a  bitter quarrel between Smith and another of the adventurers, Captain  Edward Wingfield.    Captain Wingfield was twice John Smith's age, and deemed that he knew  much better how a colony ought to be formed than this dictatorial  youth of twenty-seven.  He himself was just as dictatorial and  narrow into the bargain.  So between the two the voyage was by no  means peaceful.    Good Master Hunt, the preacher who went with the expedition, in  spite of the fact that he was so weak and ill that few thought he  would live, did his best to still the angry passions.    To some extent he succeeded.  And when a fair wind blew at length  the ships spread their sails to it and were soon out of sight of  England.  Two months of storm and danger passed before the adventurers  sighted the West Indies.  Here they went ashore on the island of  San Dominica.  Delighted once more to see land and escape from the  confinement of the ship, they stayed three weeks among the sunny  islands.  They hunted and fished, traded with the savages, boiled  pork in hot natural springs, feasted on fresh food and vegetables,  and generally enjoyed themselves.    But among all this merry-making Wingfield did not forget his anger  against John Smith.  Their quarrels became so bad that Wingfield  decided to end both quarrels and John Smith.  So he ordered a gallows  to be set up and, having accused Smith of mutiny, made ready to  hang him.  But John Smith stoutly defended himself.  Nothing could be  proved against him.  He laughed at the gallows, and as he quaintly  puts it \"could not be persuaded to use them.\"    Nevertheless, although nothing could be proved against him, there  were many who quite agreed that Captain John Smith was a turbulent  fellow.  So to keep him quiet they clapped him in irons and kept him  so until their arrival in Virginia.  After leaving the West Indies  the adventurers fell into more bad weather, and lost their course;  but finally they arrived safely in Chesapeake Bay.    They named the capes on either side Henry and Charles, in honour  of the two sons of their King.  Upon Cape Henry they set up a brass  cross upon which was carved \"Jacobus Rex\" and thus claimed the  land for England.  Then they sailed on up the river which they named  James River, in honour of the King himself.  Their settlement they  named Jamestown, also in his honour.  Jamestown has now disappeared,  but the two capes and the river are still called by the names given  them by these early settlers.    Before this expedition sailed the directors of the Company had  arranged who among the colonists were to be the rulers.  But for  some quaint reason they were not told.  Their names, together with  many instructions as to what they were to do, were put into a sealed  box, and orders were given that this box was not to be opened until  Virginia was reached.    The box was now opened, and it was found that John Smith was named  among the seven who were to form the council.  The others were much  disgusted at this, and in spite of all he could say, they refused  to have him in the council.  They did, however, set him free from  his fetters.  Of the council Wingfield was chosen President.  All  the others, except John Smith, took oath to do their best for the  colony.  Then at once the business of building houses was begun.  While the council drew plans the men dug trenches and felled trees  in order to clear space on which to pitch their tents, or otherwise  busied themselves about the settlement.    The Indians appeared to be friendly, and often came to look  on curiously at these strange doings.  And Wingfield thought them  so gentle and kindly that he would not allow the men to build any  fortifications except a sort of screen of interwoven boughs.    Besides building houses one of the colonists' first cares was  to provide themselves with a church.  But indeed it was one of the  quaintest churches ever known.  An old sail was stretched beneath  a group of trees to give shelter from the burning sun.  And to make  a pulpit a plank of wood was nailed between two trees which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#18)"],[1,"dwelling.  Lucien and Eliza were the performers in a piece called Alzire. The  ardor of their declamation, the freedom of their gestures, and above  all the indelicacy of the costume which they assumed, displeased  Napoleon exceedingly. As soon as the play was over he exclaimed,  \"It is a scandal. I ought not to suffer such indecencies. I will  give Lucien to understand that I will have no more of it.\" As  soon as Lucien entered the saloon, having resumed his usual dress,  Napoleon addressed him before the whole company, and requested him  in future to desist from all such representations. \"What!\" said  he, \"when I am endeavoring to restore purity of manners, my brother  and sister must needs exhibit themselves upon a platform, almost  in a state of nudity! It is an insult!\"    One day at this time Bourrienne, going from Malmaison to Ruel, lost  a beautiful watch. He proclaimed his loss by means of the bellman  at Ruel. An hour after, as he was sitting down to dinner, a peasant  boy brought him the watch, which he had found on the road. Napoleon  heard of the occurrence. Immediately he instituted inquiries  respecting the young man and the family. Hearing a good report of  them, he gave the three brothers employment, and amply rewarded  the honest lad. \"Kindness,\" says Bourrienne, \"was a very prominent  trait in the character of Napoleon.\"    If we now take a brief review of what Napoleon had accomplished  since his return from Egypt, it must be admitted that the records  of the world are to be searched in vain for a similar recital. No  mortal man before ever accomplished so much, or accomplished it so  well, in so short a time.    Let us for a moment return to his landing at Frejus on the 8th of  October, 1799, until he was chosen First Consul for life, in August,  1802, a period of not quite three years. Proceeding to Paris, almost  alone, he overthrew the Directory, and seized the supreme power;  restored order into the administration of government, established  a new and very efficient system for the collection of taxes, raised  public credit, and supplied the wants of the suffering army. By  great energy and humanity he immediately terminated the horrors of  that unnatural war which had for years, been desolating La Vendee.  Condescending to the attitude of suppliant, he implored of Europe  peace. Europe chose war. By a majestic conception of military  combinations, he sent Moreau with a vast army to the Rhime; stimulated  Massena to the most desperate strife at Genoa, and then, creating  as by magic, an army, from materials which excited but the ridicule  of his foes, he climbed, with artillery and horse, and all the  munitions of war, the icy pinnacles of the Alps, and fell like an  avalanche upon his foes upon the plain of Marengo. With far inferior  numbers, he snatched the victory from the victors; and in the  exultant hour of the most signal conquest, wrote again from the  field of blood imploring peace. His foes, humbled, and at his mercy,  gladly availed themselves of his clemency, and promised to treat.  Perfidiously, they only sought time to regain their strength. He  then sent Moreau to Hohenlinden, and beneath the walls of Vienna  extorted peace with continental Europe. England still prosecuted  the war. The first Consul, by his genius, won the heart of Paul  of Russia, secured the affection of Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden,  and formed a league of all Europe against the Mistress of the Seas.  While engaged in this work, he paid the creditors of the State,  established the Bank of France, overwhelmed the highway robbers  with utter destruction, and restored security in all the provinces;  cut magnificent communications over the Alps, founded hospitals  on their summits, surrounded exposed cities with fortifications,  opened canals, constructed bridges, created magnificent roads, and  commenced the compiliation of that civil code which will remain an  ever-during monument of his labors and his genius. In opposition  to the remonstrances of his best friends, he re-established  Christianity, and with it proclaimed perfect liberty of conscience.  Public works were every where established, to encourage industry.  Schools and colleges were founded Merit of every kind was stimulated  by abundant rewards. Vast improvements were made in Paris, and the  streets cleaned and irrigated. In the midst of all these cares,  he was defending France against the assaults of the most powerful  nation on the globe; and he was preparing, as his last resort, a vast  army, to carry the war into the heart of England. Notwithstanding  the most atrocious libels with which England was filled against him,  his fame shone resplendent through them all, and he was popular  with the English people. Many of the most illustrious of the English  statesmen advocated his cause. His gigantic adversary, William Pitt.  vanquished by the genius of Napoleon, was compelled to retire from  the ministry--and the world was at peace.    The difficulties, perplexities, embarrassments which were encountered  in those enterprises, were infinite. Says Napoleon, with that  magnanimity which history should recognize and applaud, \"We are  told that all the First Consul has to look to, was to do justice.  But to whom was he to do justice? To the proprietors whom the  revolution had violently despoiled of their properties, for this  only, that they had been faithful to their legitimate sovereign to  the principle of honor which they had inherited from their ancestors;  or to those new proprietors, who had purchased these domains,  adventuring their money on the faith of laws flowing from  an illegitimate authority? Was he to do justice to those royalist  soldiers, mutilated in the fields of Germany, La Vendee, and  Quiberon, arrayed under the white standard of the Bourbons, in the  firm belief that they were serving the cause of their king against  a usurping tyranny; or to the million of citizens, who, forming  around the frontiers a wall of brass, had so often saved their  country from the inveterate hostility of its enemies, and had borne  to so transcendent a height the glory of the French eagle? Was he  to do justice to that clergy, the model and the example of every  Christian virtue, stripped of its birthright, the reward of fifteen  hundred years of benevolence; or to the recent acquires, who had  converted the convents into workshops, the churches into warehouses,  and had turned to profane uses all that had been deemed most holy  for ages?\"    \"At this period,\" says Theirs, \"Napoleon appeared so moderate,  after having been so victorious, he showed himself so profound a  legislator, after having proved himself so great a commander, he  evinced so much love for the arts of peace, after having excelled  in the arts of war, that well might he excite illusions in France  and in the world. Only some few among the parsonages who were  admitted to his councils, who were capable of judging futurity by  the present, were filled with as much anxiety as admiration, on  witnessing the indefatigable activity of his mind and body, and  the energy of his will, and the impetuosity of his desires. They  trembled even at seeing him do good, in the way he did--so impatient  was he to accomplish it quickly, and upon an immense scale. The  wise and sagacious Tronchet, who both admired and loved him, and  looked upon him as the savior of France, said, nevertheless, one  day in a tone of deep feeling to Cambracers, 'This young man begins  like Caesar: I fear that he will end like him.`\"    The elevation of Napoleon to the supreme power for life was regarded  by most of the states of continental Europe with satisfaction, as  tending to diminish the dreaded influences of republicanism, and to  assimilate France with the surrounding monarchies. Even in England,  the prime Minister, Mr. Addington, assured the French embassador  of the cordial approbation of the British government of an event,  destined to consolidate order and power in France. The King of Prussia,  the Emperor Alexander, and the Archduke Charles of Austria, sent  him their friendly congratulations. Even Catharine, the haughty  Queen of Naples, mother of the Empress of Austria, being then at  Vienna, in ardent expression of her gratification to the French  embassador said, \"General Bonaparte is a great man. He has done me  much injury, but that shall not prevent me from acknowledging his  genius. By checking disorder in France, he has rendered a service  to all of Europe. He has attained the government of his country  because he is most worthy of it. I hold him out every day as a  pattern to the young princes of the imperial family. I exhort them  to study that extraordinary personage, to learn from him how to  direct nations, how to make the yoke of authority endurable, by  means of genius and glory.\"    But difficulties were rapidly rising between England and France.  The English were much disappointed in not finding that sale of  their manufactures which they had anticipated. The cotton and iron  manufactures were the richest branches of industry in England.  Napoleon, supremely devoted to the development of the manufacturing  resources of France, encouraged those manufactures by the almost  absolute prohibition of the rival articles. William Pitt and his  partisans, still retaining immense influence, regarded with extreme  jealousy the rapid strides which Napoleon was making to power, and  incessantly declaimed, in the journals, against the ambition of  France. Most of the royalist emigrants, who had refused to acknowledge  the new government, and were still devoted to the cause of the  Bourbons, had taken refuge in London. They had been the allies  with England in the long war against France. The English government  could not refrain from sympathizing with them in their sufferings.  It would have been ungenerous not to have done so. The emigrants  were many of them supported by pensions paid "]]]
