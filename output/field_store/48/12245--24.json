Drummond was wont to keep a swagger-stick by his  bedside for the better observance of law and order. Sheen possessed  himself of this swagger-stick, and reasoned with the sportive youth.  The rest of the dormitory looked on in interested silence. It was a  critical moment, and on his handling of it depended Sheen's victory or  defeat. If he did not keep his head he was lost. A dormitory is  merciless to a prefect whose weakness they have discovered.    Sheen kept his head. In a quiet, pleasant voice, fingering the  swagger-stick, as he spoke, in an absent manner, he requested his young  friend to re-make the bed--rapidly and completely. For the space of  five minutes no sound broke the silence except the rustle of sheets and  blankets. At the end of that period the bed looked as good as new.    \"Thanks,\" said Sheen gratefully. \"That's very kind of you.\"    He turned to the rest of the dormitory.    \"Don't let me detain you,\" he said politely. \"Get into bed as soon as  you like.\"    The dormitory got into bed sooner than they liked. For some reason the  colossal rag they had planned had fizzled out. They were thoughtful as  they crept between the sheets. Could these things be?           *       *       *       *       *    After much deliberation Sheen sent his letter to Drummond on the  following day. It was not a long letter, but it was carefully worded.  It explained that he had taken up boxing of late, and ended with a  request that he might be allowed to act as Drummond's understudy in the  House competitions.    It was late that evening when the infirmary attendant came over with  the answer.    Like the original letter, the answer was brief.    \"Dear Sheen,\" wrote Drummond, \"thanks for the offer. I am afraid I  can't accept it. We must have the best man. Linton is going to box for  the House in the Light-Weights.\"          XVII    SEYMOUR'S ONE SUCCESS      This polite epistle, it may be mentioned, was a revised version of the  one which Drummond originally wrote in reply to Sheen's request. His  first impulse had been to answer in the four brief words, \"Don't be a  fool\"; for Sheen's letter had struck him as nothing more than a  contemptible piece of posing, and he had all the hatred for poses which  is a characteristic of the plain and straightforward type of mind. It  seemed to him that Sheen, as he expressed it to himself, was trying to  \"do the boy hero\". In the school library, which had been stocked during  the dark ages, when that type of story was popular, there were numerous  school stories in which the hero retrieved a rocky reputation by  thrashing the bully, displaying in the encounter an intuitive but  overwhelming skill with his fists. Drummond could not help feeling that  Sheen must have been reading one of these stories. It was all very fine  and noble of him to want to show that he was No Coward After All, like  Leo Cholmondeley or whatever his beastly name was, in _The Lads of  St. Ethelberta's_ or some such piffling book; but, thought Drummond  in his cold, practical way, what about the house? If Sheen thought that  Seymour's was going to chuck away all chance of winning one of the  inter-house events, simply in order to give him an opportunity of doing  the Young Hero, the sooner he got rid of that sort of idea, the better.  If he wanted to do the Leo Cholmondeley business, let him go and chuck  a kid into the river, and jump in and save him. But he wasn't going to  have the house let in for twenty Sheens.    Such were the meditations of Drummond when the infirmary attendant  brought Sheen's letter to him; and he seized pencil and paper and  wrote, \"Don't be a fool\". But pity succeeded contempt, and he tore up  the writing. After all, however much he had deserved it, the man had  had a bad time. It was no use jumping on him. And at one time they had  been pals. Might as well do the thing politely.    All of which reflections would have been prevented had Sheen thought of  mentioning the simple fact that it was Joe Bevan who had given him the  lessons to which he referred in his letter. But he had decided not to  do so, wishing to avoid long explanations. And there was, he felt, a  chance that the letter might come into other hands than those of  Drummond. So he had preserved silence on that point, thereby wrecking  his entire scheme.    It struck him that he might go to Linton, explain his position, and ask  him to withdraw in his favour, but there were difficulties in the way  of that course. There is a great deal of red tape about the athletic  arrangements of a house at a public school. When once an order has gone  forth, it is difficult to get it repealed. Linton had been chosen to  represent the house in the Light-Weights, and he would carry out  orders. Only illness would prevent him appearing in the ring.    Sheen made up his mind not to try to take his place, and went through  the days a victim to gloom, which was caused by other things besides  his disappointment respecting the boxing competition. The Gotford  examination was over now, and he was not satisfied with his  performance. Though he did not know it, his dissatisfaction was due  principally to the fact that, owing to his isolation, he had been  unable to compare notes after the examinations with the others. Doing  an examination without comparing notes subsequently with one's rivals,  is like playing golf against a bogey. The imaginary rival against whom  one pits oneself never makes a mistake. Our own \"howlers\" stand out in  all their horrid nakedness; but we do not realise that our rivals have  probably made others far worse. In this way Sheen plumbed the depths of  depression. The Gotford was a purely Classical examination, with the  exception of one paper, a General Knowledge paper; and it was in this  that Sheen fancied he had failed so miserably. His Greek and Latin  verse were always good; his prose, he felt, was not altogether beyond  the pale; but in the General Knowledge paper he had come down heavily.  As a matter of fact, if he had only known, the paper was an  exceptionally hard one, and there was not a single candidate for the  scholarship who felt satisfied with his treatment of it. It was to  questions ten, eleven, and thirteen of this paper that Cardew, of the  School House, who had entered for the scholarship for the sole reason  that competitors got excused two clear days of ordinary school-work,  wrote the following answer:        See \"Encylopaedia Britannica,\" _Times_ edition.    If they really wanted to know, he said subsequently, that was the  authority to go to. He himself would probably misinform them  altogether.    In addition to the Gotford and the House Boxing, the House Fives now  came on, and the authorities of Seymour's were in no small perplexity.  They met together in Rigby's study to discuss the matter. Their  difficulty was this. There was only one inmate of Seymour's who had a  chance of carrying off the House Fives Cup. And that was Sheen. The  house was asking itself what was to be done about it.    \"You see,\" said Rigby, \"you can look at it in two ways, whichever you  like. We ought certainly to send in our best man for the pot, whatever  sort of chap he is. But then, come to think of it, Sheen can't very  well be said to belong to the house at all. When a man's been cut dead  during the whole term, he can't be looked on as one of the house very  well. See what I mean?\"    \"Of course he can't,\" said Mill, who was second in command at  Seymour's. Mill's attitude towards his fellow men was one of incessant  hostility. He seemed to bear a grudge against the entire race.    Rigby resumed. He was a pacific person, and hated anything resembling  rows in the house. He had been sorry for Sheen, and would have been  glad to give him a chance of setting himself on his legs again.    \"You see,\" he said, \"this is what I mean. We either recognise Sheen's  existence or we don't. Follow? We can't get him to win this Cup for us,  and then, when he has done it, go on cutting him and treating him as if  he didn't belong to the house at all. I know he let the house down  awfully badly in that business, but still, if he lifts the Fives Cup,  that'll square the thing. If he does anything to give the house a  leg-up, he must be treated as if he'd never let it down at all.\"    \"Of course,\" said Barry. \"I vote we send him in for the Fives.\"    \"What rot!\" said Mill. \"It isn't as if none of the rest of us played  fives.\"    \"We aren't as good as Sheen,\" said Barry.    \"I don't care. I call it rot letting a chap like him represent the  house at anything. If he were the best fives-player in the world I  wouldn't let him play for the house.\"    Rigby was impressed by his vehemence. He hesitated.    \"After all, Barry,\" he said, \"I don't know. Perhaps it might--you see,  he did--well, I really think we'd better have somebody else. The house  has got its knife into Sheen too much just at present to want him as a  representative. There'd only be sickness, don't you think? Who else is  there?\"    So it came about that Menzies was chosen to uphold the house in the  Fives Courts. Sheen was not surprised. But it was not pleasant. He was  certainly having bad luck in his attempts to do something for the  house. Perhaps if he won the Gotford they might show a little  enthusiasm. The Gotford always caused a good deal of interest in the  school. It was the best thing of its kind in existence at Wrykyn, and  even the most abandoned loafers liked to feel that their house had won  it. It was just possible, thought Sheen, that a brilliant win might  change the feelings of Seymour's towards him. He did not care for the  applause of the multitude more than a boy should, but he preferred it  very decidedly to the cut direct.    Things went badly for Seymour's. Never in the history of the house, or,  at any rate, in the comparatively recent history of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#18)"],[1," in portraiture of the  different members. These groups were hung upon the walls of the  chambers where meetings were held for social purposes in times of  peace. The men of highest rank are always given the most conspicuous  places in the pictures. The flag is generally the one bit of gorgeous  colour in the scene; but Franz Hals seized the opportunity to show his  wonderful skill in detail while painting the cuffs and ruffs worn by  these grandees. In all his work there is an impression of strength  rather than of beauty; it is the charm of expressiveness he is aiming  at, rather than the charm of grace and colour to which the Italian  school was devoted. He differed from that school, also, in his choice  of subjects, for he was distinctly and almost entirely a portrait  painter, and within his own limited range he is unsurpassed. A  wonderful collection of his works is to be seen in the Haarlem Town  Hall.      PLATE--THE NURSE AND THE CHILD    Considering the woeful life that Franz Hals led, it is amazing to  think that he of all artists is the best painter of good humour. He  puts a smile on the face of nearly every one of his \"leading  characters,\" whether it be a modest young girl, a hideous old woman, a  strolling musician, or a riotous soldier, and in every case the laugh  suits the subject. It may have been his own easygoing shiftlessness,  his way of casting care aside with a jest that enabled him to live so  long and to accomplish so much in spite of his poverty and other  misfortunes.    The roguish look upon the face of this baby of the house of Ilpenstein  makes it appear older than the pleasant faced nurse. The dress of the  child is such as Hals delighted to spend his talents upon. The picture  is in the Berlin Gallery.    Among his best known paintings are \"The Laughing Cavalier,\" \"The  Fool,\" \"The Man with the Sword,\" and \"Hille Bobbe. the Witch of  Haarlem.\"          XX    MEYNDERT HOBBEMA        _Dutch School_    1637-1709    _Pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael_    When a man becomes famous many people claim his acquaintance, and  often many places his birthplace. In Hobbema's case it has never been  decided whether he was born in the little town of Koeverdam, or in the  city of Haarlem or in Amsterdam. Nor is it quite certain when he was  born; but what he did afterward, we are all acquainted with.    No one knows much about the life of this artist, but his master was  doubtless his uncle, van Ruisdael. Hobbema was dead a hundred years  before the world acknowledged his genius, thus he reaped no reward for  hard work and ambition. He, like Rembrandt, died in great poverty, and  with nearly the same surroundings. Rembrandt died forsaken in  Roosegraft Street, Amsterdam, and Hobbema died in the same  locality. We must speak chiefly about his work, since we know little  of his personality or affairs.    If Boecklin's pictures seem to be composed of vertical lines, Hobbema's  are as startling in their positive vertical and horizontal lines  combined. We are not likely to find elevations or gentle, gradual  depressions in his landscapes, but straight horizons, long trunked,  straight limbed trees; and the landscape seems to be punctured here  and there by an upright house or a spire. It is startlingly beautiful,  and so characteristic that after seeing one or two of Hobbema's  pictures we are likely to know his work again wherever we may find it.    Hobbema got at the soul of a landscape. It was as if one painted a  face that was dear to one, and not only made it a good likeness but  also painted the person as one felt him to be--all the tenderness, or  maybe all the sternness.    It may be that Hobbema's failure to get money and honours, or at the  very least, kind recognition as a great artist, while he lived,  influenced his painting, and made him see mostly the sad side of  beauty, nor it is certain that his landscapes give one a strange  feeling of sadness and desolation, even when he paints a scene of  plenty and fulness.    The French have made a phrase for his kind of work, _paysage  intime_--meaning the beloved country--the one best known. It is a fine  phrase, and it was first used to describe Rousseau's and Corot's work;  but it especially applies to Hobbema's.    While this artist was not yet recognised, his uncle van Ruisdael was  known as a great artist. The family must have been rich in spirit that  gave so much genius to the world. Hobbema certainly loved his art  above all things, for he had no return during his lifetime, save what  was given by the joy of work. There are those who complain that  Hobbema was a poor colourist. True, he used little besides grays and a  peculiar green, which seemed especially to please him; but since that  colouring belonged to the subjects he chose, one cannot complain on  the ground that what he did was unsatisfying. For lack of knowledge  about him we can think of him as a man of moods, sad, desolate ones at  that; because his work is too extreme and uniform in its character for  us to believe his method was affected.      PLATE--THE AVENUE, MIDDELHARNIS, HOLLAND    This perhaps is one of the most characteristic of Hobbema's  pictures. Note a strange hopelessness in the scene, as well as  beauty. The tall and solemn trees, the high light upon the road,  suggesting to us all sorts of joys struggling through the  cheerlessness of life. What other artist would have chosen such a  corner of nature for a subject to paint? To quote a fine description:    \"He loved the country-side, studied it as a lover, and has depicted it  with such intimacy of truth that the road to Middelharnis seems as  real to-day as it did over a hundred years ago to the artist. We see  the poplars, with their lopped stems, lifting their bushy tops against  that wide, high sky which floats over a flat country, full of billowy  clouds as the sky near the North Sea is apt to be. Deep ditches skirt  the road, which drain and collect the water for purposes of  irrigation, and later on will join some deeper, wider canal, for  purposes of navigation. We get a glimpse on the right, of patient  perfection of gardening, where a man is pruning his grafted fruit  trees; farther on a group of substantial farm buildings. On the  opposite side of the road stretches a long, flat meadow, or \"polder,\"  up to the little village which nestles so snugly around its tall  church tower; the latter fulfilling also the purpose of a beacon, lit  by night, to guide the wayfarer on sea and land; scene of tireless  industry, comfortable prosperity, and smiling peace. ... Pride and  love of country breathe through the whole scene. To many of us the  picture smiles less than it thrills with sadness. Perhaps it speaks  thus only to those who find a kind of hurt in the revival of the  spring, which promises so much and may fulfill so little.\"    Hobbema's \"Watermill\" is very well-known and so are his \"Wooded  Landscape,\" and \"Haarlem's Little Forest.\"          XXI    WILLIAM HOGARTH        _School of Hogarth (English)_    1697-1764    William Hogarth, like Watteau, originated his own school; in short  there never was anybody like him. He was an editorial writer in  charcoal and paint, or in other words he had a story to tell every  time he made a picture, and there was an argument in it, a right and a  wrong, and he presented his point of view by making pictures.    English artists in literature and in painting have done some great  reformatory work. Charles Dickens overthrew some dreadful abuses by  writing certain novels. The one which has most interest for children  is the awful story of Dotheboys' Hall, which exposed the ill treatment  of pupils in a certain class of English schools. What Dickens and  Charles Reade did in literature, Hogarth undertook to do in  painting. He described social shams; painted things as they were, thus  making many people ashamed and possibly better.    Italians had always painted saints and Madonnas, but Hogarth pretended  to despise that sort of work, and painted only human beings. He did  not really despise Raphael, Titian, and their brother artists, but he  was so disgusted with the use that had been made of them and their  schools of art, to the entire exclusion of more familiar subjects,  that he turned satirist and ridiculed everything.    First of all, Hogarth was an engraver. He was born in London on the  10th December, 1697, and eighteen days later was baptised in the  church of St. Bartholemew the Great. His father was a school teacher  and a \"literary hack,\" which means that in literature he did whatever  he could find to do, reporting, editing, and so on.    Hogarth must early have known something of vagabond life, for his  father's life during his own youth must have brought him into  association with all sorts of people. He knew how madhouses were run,  how kings dined, how beggars slept in goods boxes, and many other  useful items.    Hogarth said of himself: \"Shows of all sorts gave me uncommon pleasure  when an infant, and mimicry, common to all children, was remarkable in  me.... My exercises, when at school, were more remarkable for the  ornaments which adorned them, than for the exercises themselves.\" He  became an engraver or silver-plater, being apprenticed to Mr. Ellis  Gamble, at the sign of the \"Golden Angel,\" Cranbourne Alley, Leicester  Fields.    Engraving on silver plate was all well enough, but Hogarth aspired to  become an engraver on copper, and he has said that this was about the  highest ambition he had while he was in Cranbourne Alley.    The shop-card which he engraved for Mr. Ellis Gamble may have been the  first significant piece of work he undertook. The card is still among  the Hogarth relics. He set up as an engraver on his own account,  though he did study a little in Sir James Thornhill's art school; but  whatever he learned he turned to characteristic account.    He continued to make shop-cards, shop-bills, and book-plates. Finally,  in "]]]
