[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4511"],[0,"The Life of the Bee (#18)"],[1," bees at a given moment to increase the size of their  dwellings. Three reasons may dictate this step: an extraordinary  harvest may call for larger receptacles, the workers may consider  the population to be sufficiently numerous, or it may have become  necessary that males should be born. Nor can we in such cases  refrain from wondering at the ingenious economy, the unerring,  harmonious conviction, with which the bees will pass from the small  to the large, from the large to the small; from perfect symmetry to,  where unavoidable, its very reverse, returning to ideal regularity  so soon as the laws of a live geometry will allow; and all the time  not losing a cell, not suffering a single one of their numerous  structures to be sacrificed, to be ridiculous, uncertain, or  barbarous, or any section thereof to become unfit for use. But I  fear that I have already wandered into many details that will have  but slender interest for the reader, whose eyes perhaps may never  have followed a flight of bees; or who may have regarded them only  with the passing interest with which we are all of us apt to regard  the flower, the bird or the precious stone, asking of these no more  than a slight superficial assurance, and forgetting that the most  trivial secret of the non-human object we behold in nature connects  more closely perhaps with the profound enigma of our origin and our  end, than the secret of those of our passions that we study the most  eagerly and the most passionately.    {60}    And I will pass over too--in my desire that this essay shall not  become too didactic--the remarkable instinct that induces the bees  at times to thin and demolish the extremity of their combs, when  these are to be enlarged or lengthened; though it must be admitted  that in this case the \"blind building instinct\" fails signally to  account for their demolishing in order that they may rebuild, or  undoing what has been done that it may be done afresh, and with more  regularity. I will content myself also with a mere reference to the  remarkable experiment that enables us, with the aid of a piece of  glass, to compel the bees to start their combs at a right angle;  when they most ingeniously contrive that the enlarged cells on the  convex side shall coincide with the reduced cells on the concave  side of the comb.    But before finally quitting this subject let us pause, though it be  but for an instant, and consider the mysterious fashion in which  they manage to act in concert and combine their labour, when  simultaneously carving two opposite sides of a comb, and unable  therefore to see each other. Take a finished comb to the light, fix  your eyes on the diaphanous wax; you will see, most clearly  designed, an entire network of sharply cut prisms, a whole system of  concordances so infallible that one might almost believe them to be  stamped on steel.    I wonder whether those who never have seen the interior of a hive  can form an adequate conception of the arrangement and aspect of the  combs. Let them imagine--we will take a peasant's hive, where the  bee is left entirely to its own resources--let them imagine a dome  of straw or osier, divided from top to bottom by five, six, eight,  sometimes ten, strips of wax, resembling somewhat great slices of  bread, that run in strictly parallel lines from the top of the dome  to the floor, espousing closely the shape of the ovoid walls.  Between these strips is contrived a space of about half an inch, to  enable the bees to stand and to pass each other. At the moment when  they begin to construct one of these strips at the top of the hive,  the waxen wall (which is its rough model, and will later be thinned  and extended) is still very thick, and completely excludes the fifty  or sixty bees at work on its inner face from the fifty or sixty  simultaneously engaged in carving the outer, so that it is wholly  impossible for one group to see the other, unless indeed their sight  be able to penetrate opaque matter. And yet there is not a hole that  is scooped on the inner surface, not a fragment of wax that is  added, but corresponds with mathematical precision to a protuberance  or cavity on the outer surface, and vice versa. How does this  happen? How is it that one does not dig too deep, another not deep  enough? Whence the invariable magical coincidence between the angles  of the lozenges? What is it tells the bees that at this point they  must begin, and at that point stop? Once again we must content  ourselves with the reply, that is no reply: \"It is a mystery of the  hive.\"    Huber has sought to explain this mystery by suggesting that the  pressure of the bees' hooks and teeth may possibly produce slight  projections, at regular intervals, on the opposite side of the comb;  or that they may be able to estimate the thickness of the block by  the flexibility, elasticity, or some other physical quality of the  wax; or again, that their antennae, which seem so well adapted for  the questioning of the finer, less evident side of things, may serve  as a compass in the invisible; or, lastly, that the position of  every cell may derive mathematically from the arrangement and  dimensions of the cells on the first row, and thus dispense with the  need for further measurement. But these explanations are evidently  insufficient; the first are mere hypotheses that cannot be verified,  the others do no more than transplant the mystery. And useful as it  may be to transplant mystery as often as we possibly can, it were  not wise to imagine that a mystery has ceased to be because we have  shifted its home.    {61}    Now let us leave these dreary building grounds, this geometrical  desert of cells. The combs have been started, and are becoming  habitable. Though it be here the infinitely little that, without  apparent hope, adds itself to the infinitely little; though our eye  with its limited vision look and see nothing, the work of wax,  halting neither by day nor by night, will advance with incredible  quickness. The impatient queen already has more than once paced the  stockades that gleam white in the darkness; and no sooner is the  first row of dwellings complete than she takes possession with her  escort of counsellors, guardians, or servants--for we know not  whether she lead or be led, be venerated or supervised. When the  spot has been reached that she, or her urgent advisers, may regard  as favourable, she arches her back, bends forward, and introduces  the extremity of her long spindle-shaped abdomen into one of the  cells; the-little eager heads of her escort meanwhile forming a  passionate circle around her, watching her with their enormous black  eyes, supporting her, caressing her wings, and waving their feverish  antennae as though to encourage, incite, or congratulate. You may  easily discover the spot where the queen shall be found by the sort  of starry cockade, or oval brooch perhaps of the imposing kind our  grandmothers used to wear, of which she forms the central stone. And  one may mention here the curious fact that the workers always avoid  turning their back on the queen. No sooner has she approached a  group than they will invariably arrange themselves so as to face her  with eyes and antennae, and to walk backwards before her. It is a  token of respect, or of solicitude, that, unlikely as it may seem,  is nevertheless constant and general. But to return to the queen.  During the slight spasm that visibly accompanies the emission of an  egg, one of her daughters will often throw her arms round her and  appear to be whispering to her, brow pressed to brow and mouth to  mouth. But the queen, in no wise disturbed by this somewhat bold  demonstration, takes her time, tranquilly, calmly, wholly absorbed  by the mission that would seem amorous delight to her rather than  labour. And after some seconds she will rise, very quietly, take a  step back, execute a slight turn on herself, and proceed to the next  cell, into which she will first, before introducing her abdomen, dip  her head to make sure that all is in order and that she is not  laying twice in the same cell; and in the meanwhile two or three of  her escort will have plunged into the cell she has quitted to see  whether the work be duly accomplished, and to care for, and tenderly  house, the little bluish egg she has laid.    From this moment, up to the first frosts of autumn, she does not  cease laying; she lays while she is being fed, and even in her  sleep, if indeed she sleeps at all, she still lays. She represents  henceforth the devouring force of the future, which invades every  corner of the kingdom. Step by step she pursues the unfortunate  workers who are exhaustedly, feverishly erecting the cradles her  fecundity demands. We have here the union of two mighty instincts;  and their workings throw into light, though they leave unresolved,  many an enigma of the hive.    It will happen, for instance, that the workers will distance her,  and acquire a certain start; whereupon, mindful of their duties as  careful housewives to provide for the bad days ahead, they hasten to  fill with honey the cells they have wrested from the avidity of the  species. But the queen approaches; material wealth must give way to  the scheme of nature; and the distracted workers are compelled with  all speed to remove the importunate treasure.    But assume them to be a whole comb ahead, and to have no longer  before them her who stands for the tyranny of days they shall none  of them see; we find then that they eagerly, hurriedly, build a zone  of large cells, cells for males; whose construction is very much  easier, and far more rapid. When the queen in her turn attains this  unthankful zone, she will regretfully lay a few eggs there, then  cease, pass beyond, and clamour for more workers' cells. Her  daughters obey; little by little they reduce the cells; and then the  pursuit starts afresh, till at last the insatiable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#18)"],[1,"are Christ's and Christ is God's. * * * * These shall dwell      in the presence of God and his Christ for ever and ever. These are      they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds      of heaven, to reign on the earth over his people. These are they      who shall have a part in the first resurrection. These are they who      shall come forth in the resurrection of the just. * * * These are      they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of      the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through      the shedding of his own blood. These are they whose bodies are      celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God,      the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written      of as being typical.\"[15]    _The Terrestrial Glory:_--This, the next lower degree, will be received  by many whose works do not merit the highest reward. We read of them:        \"These are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs      from that of the Church of the First-born who have received the      fulness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the      sun in the firmament. Behold, these are they who died without law,      and also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the      Son visited, and preached the Gospel unto them, that they might be      judged according to {98} men in the flesh, who received not the      testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it. These      are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by      the craftiness of men. These are they who receive of his glory,      but not of his fulness. These are they who receive of the presence      of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father; wherefore they      are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in      glory as the moon differs from the sun. These are they who are not      valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore they obtain not the      crown over the kingdom of our God.\"[16]    _The Telestial Glory:_--The revelation continues:        \"And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that      of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs from that of      the glory of the moon in the firmament. These are they who received      not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus. These are      they who deny not the Holy Spirit. These are they who are thrust      down to hell. These are they who shall not be redeemed from the      devil, until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ the      Lamb shall have finished his work.\"[17]    We learn further that the inhabitants of this kingdom are to be graded  among themselves, comprising as they do the unenlightened among the  varied opposing sects and divisions of men, and sinners of many types,  whose offenses are not those of utter perdition:        \"For as one star differs from another star in glory, even so      differs one from another in glory in the telestial world; for these      are they who are of Paul, and of Apollos, and of Cephas. These are      they who say they are some of one and some of another--some of      Christ and some of John, and {99} some of Moses, and some of Elias,      and some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch; but      received not the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither      the prophets, neither the everlasting covenant.\"[18]    The three kingdoms of widely differing glories are organized on an  orderly plan of gradation. We have seen that the telestial kingdom  comprises several subdivisions; this also is the case, we are told,  with the celestial;[19] and, by analogy, we conclude that a similar  condition prevails in the terrestrial. Thus the innumerable degrees  of merit amongst mankind are provided for in an infinity of graded  glories. The celestial kingdom is supremely honored by the personal  ministrations of the Father and the Son. The terrestrial kingdom will  be administered through the higher, without a fulness of glory. The  telestial is governed through the ministrations of the terrestrial, by  \"angels who are appointed to minister for them.\"[20]    Exaltation in the kingdom of God implies attainment to the graded  orders of the Holy Priesthood, and with these the ceremonies of the  endowment are directly associated.    _The Temple Endowment_, as administered in modern temples, comprises  instruction relating to the significance and sequence of past  dispensations, and the importance of the present as the greatest and  grandest era in human history. This course of instruction includes  a recital of the most prominent events of the creative period, the  condition of our first parents in the Garden of Eden, their {100}  disobedience and consequent expulsion from that blissful abode, their  condition in the lone and dreary world when doomed to live by labor  and sweat, the plan of redemption by which the great transgression may  be atoned, the period of the great apostasy, the restoration of the  Gospel with all its ancient powers and privileges, the absolute and  indispensable condition of personal purity and devotion to the right in  present life, and a strict compliance with Gospel requirements.    As will be shown, the temples erected by the Latter-day Saints provide  for the giving of these instructions in separate rooms, each devoted to  a particular part of the course; and by this provision it is possible  to have several classes under instruction at one time.    The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part  of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of  strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and  pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth  and the uplifting of the race; to maintain devotion to the cause of  truth; and to seek in every way to contribute to the great preparation  that the earth may be made ready to receive her King,--the Lord Jesus  Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each  obligation a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the  faithful observance of the conditions.    No jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting  and sanctifying. In every detail the endowment ceremony contributes  to covenants of morality of life, consecration of person to high  ideals, devotion to truth, patriotism to nation, and allegiance to  God. The blessings of the House of the Lord are restricted to no {101}  privileged class; every member of the Church may have admission to the  temple with the right to participate in the ordinances thereof, if he  comes duly accredited as of worthy life and conduct.    SEALING IN MARRIAGE    The Latter-day Saints regard the marriage ceremony performed  exclusively within temple precincts, as the one and only perfect  contract of matrimony.[21] They recognize the full legal validity and  moral obligation of any marriage entered into under the secular law;  but civil marriages and indeed all marriages made without the binding  authority of the Holy Priesthood they regard as contracts for this  life only, and therefore lacking the higher and superior elements of a  complete and perpetual union. They hold that the family relationships  of earth may be made lasting and binding beyond the veil of death. They  say that under the perfect law operative in the celestial worlds, the  earthly relation of husband and wife, parent and child, will endure in  full force and effect, provided such relationship has been sealed on  earth by the power and authority of the Holy Priesthood. The ordinary  rite of matrimony as established by secular law, and as prescribed by  sectarian rule, unites the man and the woman for this world only; the  higher law of marriage as divinely revealed joins the parties for time  and eternity.    \"Celestial Marriage\" is a term in current use among the Latter-day  Saints, though it does not occur in any revelation contained in the  standard works of the Church. {102} The Church adopts and validates  the scriptures of earlier dispensations with respect to marriage. It  holds that marriage is honorable[22] and ordained of God.[23] Under  the teachings of the Church, marriage is the duty of all who are not  debarred by physical or other effective disability from assuming the  responsibilities of the wedded state. The Latter-day Saints declare  that part of the birthright of every worthy man is to stand at the head  of a family as husband and father; and equally strong is the right of  every worthy woman to be an honored wife and mother.    The Church denounces as false and pernicious the teachings of misled  and morbid men who say that the union of the sexes is but a carnal  necessity inherited by man as an incident of his degraded nature; and  it repudiates the thought that celibacy is a superior condition more  pleasing to God. Concerning such false teachers the Lord has spoken in  this day:        \"Whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is      ordained of God unto man * * * that the earth might answer the end      of its creation, and that it might be filled with the measure of      man, according to his creation before the world was made.\"[24]    The Latter-day Saints affirm that perfect marriage provides for the  eternal relation of the sexes. With this people marriage is not merely  a contract for time, effective only as long as the parties shall live  on earth, but a solemn covenant of union which shall endure beyond the  {103} grave. In the complete ceremony of marriage as ordained by the  Church and as administered only within the temple halls, the man and  the woman are placed under covenant of mutual fidelity, not until death  do them part, but for time and for all eternity.    A contract as far-reaching as this, a covenant declared to be effective  not only throughout the"]]]
