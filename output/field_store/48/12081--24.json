They took their heads from life, and improved upon them  by general ideas of the beautiful. Hence Annibal's Madonnas, many of them  of a small size on copper, exhibit a peculiar and original beauty derived  from his studies; and the same may be said of Lodovico, who, in his softer  heads, often gives the portrait of a lady named Giacomazzi, celebrated for  her beauty at that time. The Caracci were extremely well-grounded in a  knowledge of anatomy, and of the naked figure; and it would be manifest  injustice not to give them credit for due estimation of Michelangiolo, whom  they also imitated. One of them indeed is known to have said, with some  acrimony towards the rival school, that Bonarruoti ought to have covered  his bones with a little flesh, in the manner of their own Tibaldi. It is  true they availed themselves less of the naked form in composition than the  Florentines, though more largely than the other schools. In their costume,  they were not so anxious to observe the exactness and richness of Paul  Veronese, as the grandeur of his folds and form; nor did any other school  give more ample flow of drapery, or arrange it with dignity more suitable  to the figures.    Yet Mengs denies that they were consummate colourists, though they studied  the Lombard and Venetian schools, an opinion confirmed by Lodovico's  paintings in oil, which are faded and almost gone. This arose, either from  the nature of his grounds, from too abundant use of oil, or from not  allowing due time between preparing his canvass and colouring it. The same  remark will not apply to his frescos, which, on a near view, exhibit a  boldness of hand equal almost to Paolo's; nor, in the opinion of Bellori,  was there any work which, in point of colouring, reflected higher credit on  the Caracci, and on the age, than their pictures in the Casa Magnani. They  boast a truth, force, mixture, and harmony of colours, such as to entitle  them also in this portion of the art to the praise of being reformers of  the age. They effectually banished those wretched yellows, and other weak,  washy tints, introduced from parsimony, in place of the azures and  different colours of higher price. In this Bellori accords most merit to  Annibal; declaring it was owing to him that Lodovico himself renounced his  first method of colouring, which was formed on that of Procaccini.    In action and expression they aimed at vivacity, but without ever losing  sight of propriety, of which they were extremely observant; and to which  they were ready to sacrifice any of the graces of the art. In taste of  invention and composition, they come near that of Raffaello. The Caracci  were not lavish of their figures, conceiving twelve sufficient for any  historical piece, except in crowds, or in battle-pieces, where they were  still moderate, in order to give greater relief to particular groups. That  they were competent to compose with judgment, learning, and variety, is  fully apparent from their sacred histories represented on altars, where  they avoided, as much as possible, the very trite representation of a  Madonna between various saints. This truth is still more remarkably shewn  in their profane histories, and in none better than those of Romulus, in  the family just before mentioned. The three relations there appear  universal in the art, as perspective, landscape, and ornamental painters,  masters of every style, and concentering in one point of view whatever is  most desirable in any single work. The three artists seem to disappear in  one; and the same is observed also in several galleries and churches of  Bologna. They followed the same maxims, and in the same studio designed in  union with one another, conferring and taking measures how best to complete  every work in hand. In several instances it still remains matter of doubt  whether pictures are to be attributed to Annibal or to Lodovico; and the  three scriptural histories of the Sampieri, in which the three relations  wished to display their respective powers, do not exhibit a diversity which  might essentially characterize their respective authors. Some indeed there  are who may detect in Lodovico a more general imitation of Titian, than is  observable in the cousins, Agostino inclining more to the taste of  Tintoretto, Annibal to that of Coreggio. It has sometimes been remarked  that the figures of the first of the three are light in form, those of the  third, robust; while those of Agostino hold a middle rank. At Bologna I  found Lodovico enjoying most repute for a certain elevation and grandeur;  Agostino for his inventive powers; Annibal for grace. Every one must judge,  however, according to his own views. It is now my duty to consider these  separately.    Lodovico, doubtless, rises into the sublime in many of his works at  Bologna. His picture of the \"_Probatica_\" so excellent both in point of  architecture and the design of the figures; that of S. Girolamo, who,  suspending his pen, turns towards heaven with a look and gesture so truly  impressive and dignified; his Limbo of holy fathers, which, as if to renew  his delight in it, he repeated in the cathedral of Piacenza, and sketched  also under a Crucifixion at Ferrara: these have ever been regarded in that  school as models of the sublime. Nevertheless, if we examine the  \"Assumption,\" at the Teresiani, the \"Paradise,\" at the Barnabiti, or the  \"S. George,\" in which is represented that admirable virgin, who is seen  seized with terror in the act of flight, it will be allowed that Annibal  himself could not have exhibited more grace in his drawing of young maidens  or of boys. More excelling, therefore, than great, Lodovico may be said to  be transcendant in every character; and it would even seem that he had  aimed at this boast in the two frescos that have perished, with which he  decorated, at S. Domenico, the chapel of the Lambertini. In one he  exhibited the holy founder, with S. Francis, in a manner very easy and  pleasing to the eye, with few lights and as few shades, but both powerful,  and with few folds in the drapery; the countenances full of piety; insomuch  that the whole performance, in the words of Malvasia, \"rose to a pitch of  grandeur not to be excelled.\" In the other piece he represented \"Charity,\"  in a style equally soft, graceful, and polished, and which was  subsequently, says the historian, esteemed \"the model and the rule of  modern painting.\" He proceeds to relate, that Albani, Guido, and  Domenichino all derived their sweetness from this source, in the same way,  most probably, that Cavedoni took his first style from the S. Domenico; and  from his Paul at the Conventuali Guercino acquired his grand power of  chiaroscuro. In short, if we may give credit to history, Lodovico in his  own school ranks like Homer among the Greeks, _fons ingeniorum_. Individual  artists in him have recognized what constituted the character of their own  knowledge, because in every branch of painting he was truly profound.[24]         Footnote 24: See Crespi's analysis of the two pictures at       the church of the Certosa, (p. 32,) one representing the       Scourging of Christ, the other his Crown of Thorns, where       the most beautiful art of disposing the light to produce the       desired effect is remarkable; with an exquisite effect of       perspective, and a degree of invention not to be surpassed       in representing the suffering of our Redeemer.    The masterly dignity of his character appears to most advantage in the  cloister of S. Michele in Bosco, where, assisted by his pupils, he  represented the actions of St. Benedict and St. Cecilia in thirty-seven  separate histories. By his hand is the Conflagration of Mount Cassino, and  some other portions; the remaining parts are by Guido, by Tiarini, by  Massari, by Cavedoni, by Spada, by Garbieri, by Brizio, and other young  artists. These paintings have been engraved, and are worthy of the  reformers of that age. On beholding what we may term this gallery by  different hands, we should be almost inclined to bestow upon the school of  Lodovico this trite eulogy; that from it, as from the Trojan horse, there  issued only princes. What does him still more honour is, that his relatives  themselves, down to the least and last, uniformly venerated him as a  preceptor, insomuch that Annibal, on the completion of the Farnese gallery,  invited him to Rome, as the adviser, arbiter, and umpire of that work. He  remained there less than two weeks, and then returning to his beloved  Bologna, he survived Agostino seventeen years, and Annibal ten. Being  separated from the two cousins, he employed himself at an advanced age in a  manner less studied, but still exemplary and masterly. Nor ought a few  slight inaccuracies of design to detract from the praise due to him,  inaccuracies which he fell into about this period, as in the drawing of the  hand of the Redeemer, in the act of calling St. Matthew to follow him, or  in the foot of the Madonna of the Annunciation painted at S. Pietro, a  fault which he saw too late, and it may be added, for which he died of  affliction. Other less well founded criticisms advanced against him by a  traveller have been fully rebutted and confuted by the Can. Crespi.[25]         Footnote 25: _Lettere Pittoriche_, tom. vii. lettera 4.    Agostino, occupied for the most part in engraving, painted but little, this  employment supplying him at once with the means of subsistence, and of  shining in the class of artists. Doubtless painting here sustained a loss,  deprived of a genius equally calculated as his relations to promote the  art. His powers of invention surpassed those of the other Caracci, and many  rank him foremost in point of design. It is certain that in his engraving  he corrected and improved upon the outlines of his originals.

DAUP: Ay, you have many plots! so you had one to make all the     wenches in love with me.
