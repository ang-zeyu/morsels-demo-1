At the last  words, he violently slapped his forehead with his hand, and cried out:    \"Imbecile! Imbecile!\"    \"You have rightly named yourself,\" said M. Lecoq. \"Imbecile! This proof  stares you right in the face, and you don't see it! This scratch is the  sole and only clew to work the case upon, and you must go and lose the  traces of it. If I find the guilty party, it will be by means of this  scratch; and I am determined that I will find him.\"    At a distance the Squirrel very bravely abused and defied M. Lecoq; but,  in his presence, he yielded to the influence which this extraordinary  man exercised upon all who approached him.    This exact information, these minute details of all his secret  movements, and even thoughts, so upset his mind that he could not think  where and how M. Lecoq had obtained them. Finally he said, humbly:    \"You must have been looking up this case, patron?\"    \"Probably I have; but I am not infallible, and may have overlooked some  important evidence. Take a seat, and tell me all you know.\"    M. Lecoq was not the man to be hoodwinked, so Fanferlot told the exact  truth, a rare thing for him to do. However as he reached the end of his  statement, a feeling of mortified vanity prevented his telling how he  had been fooled by Gypsy and the stout man.    Unfortunately for poor Fanferlot, M. Lecoq was always fully informed on  every subject in which he interested himself.    \"It seems to me, Master Squirrel, that you have forgotten something. How  far did you follow the empty coach?\"    Fanferlot blushed, and hung his head like a guilty school-boy.    \"Oh, patron!\" he cried, \"and you know about that too! How could you  have----\"    But a sudden idea flashed across his brain: he stopped short, bounded  off his chair, and cried:    \"Oh! I know now: you were the large gentleman with red whiskers.\"    His surprise gave so singular an expression to his face that M. Lecoq  could not restrain a smile.    \"Then it was you,\" continued the bewildered detective; \"you were the  large gentleman at whom I stared, so as to impress his appearance upon  my mind, and I never recognized you! Patron, you would make a superb  actor, if you would go on the stage; but I was disguised, too--very well  disguised.\"    \"Very poorly disguised; it is only just to you that I should let you  know what a failure it was, Fanferlot. Do you think that a heavy beard  and a blouse are a sufficient transformation? The eye is the thing to be  changed--the eye! The art lies in being able to change the eye. That is  the secret.\"    This theory of disguise explained why the lynx-eyed Lecoq never appeared  at the police-office without his gold spectacles.    \"Then, patron,\" said Fanferlot, clinging to his idea, \"you have been  more successful than Mme. Alexandre; you have made the little girl  confess? You know why she leaves the Archangel, why she does not wait  for M. de Clameran, and why she bought calico dresses?\"    \"She is following my advice.\"    \"That being the case,\" said the detective dejectedly, \"there is nothing  left for me to do, but to acknowledge myself an ass.\"    \"No, Squirrel,\" said M. Lecoq, kindly, \"you are not an ass. You  merely did wrong in undertaking a task beyond your capacity. Have you  progressed one step since you started this affair? No. That shows that,  although you are incomparable as a lieutenant, you do not possess the  qualities of a general. I am going to present you with an aphorism;  remember it, and let it be your guide in the future: _A man can shine in  the second rank, who would be totally eclipsed in the first_.\"    Never had Fanferlot seen his patron so talkative and good-natured.  Finding his deceit discovered, he had expected to be overwhelmed with  a storm of anger; whereas he had escaped with a little shower that had  cooled his brain. Lecoq's anger disappeared like one of those heavy  clouds which threaten in the horizon for a moment, and then are suddenly  swept away by a gust of wind.    But this unexpected affability made Fanferlot feel uneasy. He was afraid  that something might be concealed beneath it.    \"Do you know who the thief is, patron?\"    \"I know no more than you do, Fanferlot; and you seem to have made up  your mind, whereas I am still undecided. You declare the cashier to be  innocent, and the banker guilty. I don't know whether you are right or  wrong. I started after you, and have only reached the preliminaries of  my search. I am certain of but one thing, and that is, that a scratch  was on the safe-door. That scratch is my starting-point.\"    As he spoke, M. Lecoq took from his desk and unrolled an immense sheet  of drawing-paper.    On this paper was photographed the door of M. Fauvel's safe. The  impression of every detail was perfect. There were the five movable  buttons with the engraved letters, and the narrow, projecting brass  lock: The scratch was indicated with great exactness.    \"Now,\" said M. Lecoq, \"here is our scratch. It runs from top to bottom,  starting from the hole of the lock, diagonally, and, observe, from left  to right; that is to say, it terminates on the side next to the private  staircase leading to the banker's apartments. Although very deep at the  key-hole, it ends off in a scarcely perceptible mark.\"    \"Yes, patron, I see all that.\"    \"Naturally you thought that this scratch was made by the person who took  the money. Let us see if you were right. I have here a little iron box,  painted with green varnish like M. Fauvel's safe; here it is. Take a  key, and try to scratch it.\"    \"The deuce take it!\" he said after several attempts, \"this paint is  awfully hard to move!\"    \"Very hard, my friend, and yet that on the safe is still harder and  thicker. So you see the scratch you discovered could not have been made  by the trembling hand of a thief letting the key slip.\"    \"Sapristi!\" exclaimed Fanferlot, stupefied: \"I never should have thought  of that. It certainly required great force to make the deep scratch on  the safe.\"    \"Yes, but how was that force employed? I have been racking my brain  for three days, and only yesterday did I come to a conclusion. Let us  examine together, and see if our conjectures present enough chances of  probability to establish a starting-point.\"    M. Lecoq abandoned the photograph, and, walking to the door  communicating with his bedroom, took the key from the lock, and, holding  it in his hand, said:    \"Come here, Fanferlot, and stand by my side: there; very well. Now  suppose that I want to open this door, and you don't want me to open  it; when you see me about to insert the key, what would be your first  impulse?\"    \"To put my hands on your arm, and draw it toward me so as to prevent  your introducing the key.\"    \"Precisely so. Now let us try it; go on.\" Fanferlot obeyed; and the key  held by M. Lecoq, pulled aside from the lock, slipped along the door,  and traced upon it a diagonal scratch, from top to bottom, the exact  reproduction of the one in the photograph.    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" exclaimed Fanferlot in three different tones of  admiration, as he stood gazing in a revery at the door.    \"Do you begin to understand now?\" asked M. Lecoq.    \"Understand, patron? Why, a child could understand it now. Ah, what a  man you are! I see the scene as if I had been present. Two persons were  present at the robbery; one wished to take the money, the other wished  to prevent its being taken. That is clear, that is certain.\"    Accustomed to triumphs of this sort, M. Lecoq was much amused at  Fanferlot's enthusiasm.    \"There you go off, half-primed again,\" he said, good-humoredly: \"you  regard as sure proof a circumstance which may be accidental, and at the  most only probable.\"    \"No, patron, no! a man like you could not be mistaken: doubt no longer  exists.\"    \"That being the case, what deductions would you draw from our  discovery?\"    \"In the first place, it proves that I am correct in thinking the cashier  innocent.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Because, at perfect liberty to open the safe whenever he wished to  do so, it is not likely that he would have brought a witness when he  intended to commit the theft.\"    \"Well reasoned, Fanferlot. But on this supposition the banker would be  equally innocent: reflect a little.\"    Fanferlot reflected, and all of his animation vanished.    \"You are right,\" he said in a despairing tone. \"What can be done now?\"    \"Look for the third rogue, or rather the real rogue, the one who opened  the safe, and stole the notes, and who is still at large, while others  are suspected.\"    \"Impossible, patron--impossible! Don't you know that M. Fauvel and his  cashier had keys, and they only? And they always kept these keys in  their pockets.\"    \"On the evening of the robbery the banker left his key in the  secretary.\"    \"Yes; but the key alone was not sufficient to open the safe; the word  also must be known.\"    M. Lecoq shrugged his shoulders impatiently.    \"What was the word?\" he asked.    \"Gypsy.\"    \"Which is the name of the cashier's grisette. Now keep your eyes open.  The day you find a man sufficiently intimate with Prosper to be aware of  all the circumstances connected with this name, and at the same time on  a footing with the Fauvel family which would give him the privilege  of entering M. Fauvel's chamber, then, and not until then, will you  discover the guilty party. On that day the problem will be solved.\"    Self-sufficient and vain, like all famous men, M. Lecoq had never had a  pupil, and never wished to have one. He worked alone, because he hated  assistants, wishing to share neither the pleasures of success nor the  pain of defeat.    Thus Fanferlot, who knew his patron's character, was surprised to hear  him giving advice, who heretofore had only given orders.

[Illustration: Morphology of Fishes]          THE GAME FISHES OF THE PACIFIC COAST      Like in that portion of this work devoted to the game birds, this also  is written in popular language, avoiding, as far as possible, all  technical words and phrases, with the intention of furnishing a plain  description of the game fishes of the Coast which anyone, unlearned in  the science of ichthyology, may understand, and by which be able to  identify any of the fishes he may capture.    With fishes, like with birds, there are certain parts that must be  referred to in order to show wherein one species differs from  another. Wherever these parts have a common English name, that name  has been used. But as there are a few parts that can only be referred  to by their scientific names, a diagram has been added showing the  location of all parts referred to in the text.    In scope it treats only of such varieties as rise to the fly or are  caught by trolling with rod and reel, whether from the stream, lake,  bay or ocean, and furnish sport to the angler who fishes for the  exhilarating pleasure their capture affords.    The Pacific Coast is rich in game fishes, not only in the varieties  found in its lakes and streams, but as well in its bays and estuaries,  while the broad ocean furnishes varieties whose size and fighting  qualities are not surpassed, even if equaled, in any other part of the  world. To place in the hands of the young angler, and others who may  not have given the subject the necessary attention, a convenient  handbook by the aid of which even the novice may readily recognize the  species of fish he has landed, is the object of these pages.         *     *     *     *     *     *     *    All of the salmon, the trout, the chars, the white-fish and the lake  herring have been classed by the naturalist in one family and given  the name, =Salmonidae=; but it is only with three genera of the  subfamily, =Salmoninae= that we are concerned. These are the Pacific  salmon (=Oncorhynchus=), the true trout (=Salmo=) and the Eastern  trout and the dolly varden trout (=Salvelinus=). The Atlantic salmon  belong to the genus Salmo, the same as the true trout, and have but  one species (=Salmo salar=), which partake more of the habits of the  trout than do their Pacific cousins.      THE PACIFIC SALMON    (Oncorhynchus)    Notwithstanding the fact that the salmon is one of the most valuable  of all the food fishes, but little is known of its habits after it  leaves the stream in which it is hatched until it returns to spawn,  supposed to be from three to four years afterward. Whether they remain  near the mouths of the streams, or whether they migrate to distant  feeding grounds are questions that have never been solved. All of the  five species are caught with seins in Puget Sound in greater or less  numbers all the year round. From the action of those that spawn in the  Sacramento river it would seem that they migrate southward and far out  to sea, for on their return to spawn they enter Monterey Bay only on  its southern side, and following around it at no great distance from  the shore, leave it at the northern headlands and skirt the shore  northward until they reach the entrance to San Francisco Bay on their  way up the Sacramento river. Where the young fish make their habitat  from the time they drift down the stream in which they were spawned  until they return again to spawn has never been determined. They spawn  but once and die soon afterward. As I know that this last statement  will be disputed by some, for reasons best known to themselves, I will  quote from that excellent work by Evermann and Jordan, \"American Food  and Game Fishes.\" \"We have carefully,\" say these gentlemen, \"examined  the spawning habits of both forms of the red fish and chinook salmon  in the head waters of Salmon river, Idaho, during two entire seasons,  from the time the fish arrived in July until the end of September, by  which time all the fish had disappeared. A number of important  questions were settled by these investigations. In the first place it  was found that all of the fish arrived upon the spawning grounds in  perfect physical condition, so far as external appearances indicated;  no sores, bruises or other mutilations showing on any of more than  4000 fish examined. During the spawning, however, the majority became  more or less injured by rubbing against the gravel of the  spawning-beds, or by fighting with one another. Soon after done  spawning every one of them died, not only both forms of the red fish  but the chinook salmon as well. The dying is not due to the injuries  the fish received on the spawning-grounds; many were seen dying or  dead which showed no external or other injuries whatever. The dying of  the West Coast salmon is in no manner determined by distance from the  sea. Observations made by us and others elsewhere show that the  individuals of all species of the =Oncorhynchus= die after one  spawning, whether the spawning-beds are remote from the sea or only a  short distance from salt-water.\"    The angler's concern, however, is not so much with the procreative  habits of the salmon as it is with their behavior while feeding and  after being hooked.    Salmon are rarely caught by still fishing, but they will take the  spoon or a sardine or other small fish impaled upon the hook. They  take the bait generally with some hesitation, though at times they  strike it with all the impetuosity of the trout. Then the singing reel  calls for careful and immediate action on the part of the angler, for  the ten to forty pound fish on his light tackle is going to put up a  fight worthy of his skill. In his mad rush for liberty the gamy fish  gradually rises to the surface, and when at last checked by the skill  of the angler, he will often leap out of the water to a height of from  four to eight feet, his beautiful sides scintillating in the rays of  the sun, forming a picture to gladden the heart of the angler, for if  he be a true sportsman he will fish with such tackle only as will give  his adversary a fair chance in the fight and require the fullest  exercise of his own knowledge and skill to bring his fish to gaff. The  salmon is a strong fighter but his rushes do not last long for a fish  of its size. For this reason much of the sport of salmon fishing is  lost through the use of too heavy tackle.
