It was evident that many of the scholars,  as well as the audience, thought Ruth had failed.    \"Wait!\" exclaimed Miss Cramp, sharply. \"Did I pass that word to you,  Rosa?\"    \"No, ma'am; but I thought...\"    \"Never mind what you thought. You know the rule well enough,\" said  Miss Cramp. \"That will be your word, and I will give Ruth Fielding  another. Spell 'seraglio' again, Rosa.\"    \"'S e r a l g i o',\" spelled Rosa.    \"I thought in your haste to get ahead of Ruth you spelled it wrongly,  Rosa,\" said Miss Cramp, calmly. \"You may go down. Next--'Seraglio.'\"    Miss Ball went down in tears--angry tears--but there was not much  sympathy shown her by the audience, and little by her fellow-pupils.  It was soon seen that there was some sort of rivalry between Ruth and  Julia, and that the girl from the Red Mill had not been treated  fairly.    Oliver Shortsleeves became sadly twisted up after hearing those  immediately before him spell in succession \"schooner, tetrarch,  pibroch and anarchy\" and tried to spell \"architrave\" with so many  letters that he would have needed no more to have spelled it twice  over. So Ruth then became fourth in the line. She continued to spell  carefully and serenely. Nothing disturbed her poise, for she neither  looked around the room nor gave heed to anything that went on save  Miss Cramp's distinctly uttered words.    On and on went the steady voice of Miss Cramp. She bowled over one  pupil with \"microcosm,\" another the next minute with \"metonymy \";  \"nymphean\" and \"naphtha\" sent two more to their seats; while the  silent \"m\" in \"mnemonics\" cut a most fearful swath in the remainder,  so that after the smoke of that bomb was dissipated only Julia, Ruth,  and two others stood of all the class.    Julia Semple had darted many angry glances et Ruth since the cutting  down of her friend, Rosa Ball, and her flaunting of the girl from the  Red Mill, and her scornful looks, might easily have disturbed Ruth had  the latter not been wise enough to keep her own gaze fixed upon the  teacher.    Helen and Tom were delighted and plainly showed their enjoyment of  Ruth's success. Now, as the situation became more strained, the  audience applauded when one of the spellers overcame a more than  ordinarily difficult word. So that when the girl next to Ruth missed  \"tergiversation\" and it passed to the girl from the Red Mill, who  spelled it without hesitation, and correctly, Helen applauded softly,  while Tom audibly exclaimed: \"Good for Ruthie!\"    This did not make Julia Semple any more pleasant. She actually looked  across at Helen and Tom and scowled at them. It had already begun to  be whispered about the room that the match was easily Julia's--that  she was sure to win; and Mr. Semple, the chairman of the trustees, who  sat on the platform with the teacher, looked very well satisfied  indeed.    But Miss Cramp had come down now to the final words in the speller--  down to \"zenith\" and \"zoology.\" And still there were three standing.  Miss Cramp looked for a moment as though she would like to announce  the match a tie between the trio, for it was plain there would be hard  feelings engendered among some of the audience, as well as the pupils,  if the match continued. Her custom had been, however, to go on to the  bitter end--to spell down the very last one, and she could not easily  make a change in her method now.    A general sigh and whispering went around when she was seen to reach  for the academic dictionary which was always the foundation of the  tower of books upon the northeast corner of Miss Cramp's desk. She  opened the volume and shot out the word: \"Aperse.\"    The girl standing between Ruth and Julia staggered along until they  reached \"abstinence\"; she put an \"e\" instead of an \"i\" in the middle  syllable, and went down. But the audience applauded her. Julia Semple  began to hesitate now. The end was near. Perhaps she had never taken  the time to follow down the rows of words in the dictionary. At  \"acalycal\" she stumbled, started twice, then stopped and asked to have  it repeated.    \"'Acalycal,'\" said Miss Cramp, steadily.    \"'A c a l l y c a l,'\" stammered Julia.    \"Wrong,\" said Miss Cramp, dispassionately.    \"Next. 'Acalycal'?\"    Ruth spelled it with two 'l's' only and Miss Cramp looked up quickly.    \"Right,\" she said. \"You may step down, Julia. It has been our custom  to keep on until the winner is spelled down, too. Next word, Ruth:  'acalycine.'\"    But there was such a buzz of comment that Miss Cramp looked up again.  Julia Semple had seemed half stunned for the moment. Then she wheeled  on Ruth and said, in a sharp whisper:    \"I saw that Cameron girl spell it for you! She's been helping you all  the time! Everybody knows she's patronizing and helping you. Why,  you're wearing her old, cast-off clothes. You've got one of her  dresses on now! Pauper!\"    Ruth started back, her face turned red, then white, as though she had  been struck. The smarting tears started to her eyes, and blinded her.    \"Julia! take your seat instantly!\" said Miss Cramp, more sharply.  \"Ruth! spell 'acalycine.'\"    But Ruth could not open her lips. Had she done so she would have burst  into tears. And she could not have spelled the word right--nor any  other word right--at that moment. She merely shook her head and  followed Julia to her seat, stumblingly, while a dead silence fell  upon the room.      CHAPTER XX     UNCLE JABEZ IS MYSTERIOUS    Miss Cramp was in the habit of calling upon some trustee to speak at  the close of the exercises--usually Mr. Semple--and then there was a  little social time before the assemblage broke up. But the frown on  the chairman's face did not suggest that that gentleman had anything  very jovial to say at the moment, and the teacher closed the exercises  herself in a few words that were not at all personal to the winner of  the spelling-match.    When the stir of people moving about aroused Ruth, her only thought  was to get away from the schoolhouse. Perhaps not more than two dozen  people had distinctly heard what Julia so cruelly said to her; but it  seemed to the girl from the Red Mill as though everybody in that  throng knew that she was a charity child--that, as Julia said, the  very frock she had on belonged to somebody else.    And to Helen! She had never for a moment suspected that Helen had been  the donor of the three frocks. Of course everybody in the neighborhood  had known all the time that she was wearing Helen's cast-off clothing.  Everybody but Ruth herself would have recognized the dresses; she had  been in the neighborhood so short a time that, of course, she was not  very well acquainted with Helen's wardrobe.    At the moment she could not feel thankful to her chum. She could only  remember Julia's cutting words, and feel the sting to her pride that  she should have shown herself before all beholders the recipient of  her friend's alms.    Nobody spoke to her as she glided through the moving crowd and reached  the door. Miss Cramp was delayed in getting to her; Helen and Tom did  not see her go, for they were across the room and farthest from the  door. And so she reached the exit and slipped out.    The men and boys from outside thronged the tiny anteroom and the  steps. As she pushed through them one man said:    \"Why, here's the smart leetle gal that took Semple's gal down a peg--  eh? She'd oughter have a prize for that, that's what she ought!\"    But Ruth could not reply to this, although she knew it was meant  kindly. She went out into the darkness. There were many horses hitched  about the schoolhouse, but she reached the clear road in safety and  ran toward the Red Mill.    The girl came to the mill and went quietly into the kitchen. She had  got the best of her tears now, but Aunt Alviry's bright eyes  discovered at once that she was unhappy. Uncle Jabez did not even  raise his eyes when she came in.    \"What is the matter with my pretty leetle creetur?\" whispered the old  woman, creeping close to Ruth.    \"Nothing is the matter now,\" returned Ruth, in the same low tone.    \"Didn't you do well?\" asked the old woman, wistfully.    \"I won the spelling match,\" replied Ruth. \"I stood up longer than  anybody else.\"    \"Is that so!\" exclaimed Aunt Alvirah, with pride. \"I told ye so,  Ruthie. And ye beat that Semple gal?\"    \"She was the last one to fail before me,\" Ruth returned.    \"Well, well! D'ye hear that, Jabez? Our Ruth won the spellin'-match.\"    The miller did not raise his head from his accounts; only grunted and  nodded.    \"But something went wrong wi' ye, deary?\" persisted Aunt Alvirah,  watching Ruth's face closely.    \"Oh, Auntie! why didn't you tell me that Helen gave me the frocks?\"    \"Deary, deary, me!\" ejaculated Aunt Alvirah. \"How did you know?\"    \"Julia Semple told me--she told me before everybody!\" gasped Ruth,  fighting hard to keep back the tears. \"She called me a pauper! She  called it out before them all, and said that I wore Helen's cast-off  clothes!\"    \"The mean thing!\" said Aunt Alvirah, with more sharpness then she  usually expressed. \"Isn't that jest like the Semples? They're all that  way. Got mad with you because you beat her at spelling; eh?\"    \"Yes. But she has known it right along, of course.\"    \"Deary me!\" said Aunt Alvirah. \"Nobody supposed them frocks would be  reckernized--least of all Helen. She meant it kindly, Ruthie. It was  kindly meant.\"    \"I wish I'd worn my old black dress to rags!\" cried Ruth, who was too  hurt to be sensible or just. \"I suppose Helen meant it kindly. And you  did what you thought was right, Auntie. But all the girls have turned  up their noses at me--\"    \"Let 'em stay turned up--what do you care?\" suddenly growled Uncle  Jabez.    For the moment Ruth had forgotten his presence and she and Aunt  Alvirah had been talking more loudly. They both fell suddenly silent  and stared at him."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#18)"],[1,", with solemn faces, proceeded to the  tent where it was hoped the map would be found.  But though they went  through everything, and traced and retraced every place the professor  could remember having traversed about the canvas shelter, no signs of  the important document could be found.    \"I don't believe I dropped it out of my pocket,\" said the scientist,  for perhaps the twentieth time.    \"Then it was taken,\" declared Tom.    \"That's what I say!\" chimed in Ned.  \"And by some of Beecher's party!\"    \"Easy, my boy,\" cautioned Mr. Damon.  \"We don't want to make  accusations we can't prove.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed Professor Bumper.  \"But, though I am sorry to  say it of a fellow archaelogist, I can not help thinking Beecher had  something to do with the taking of my map.\"    \"But how could any of them get it?\" asked Mr. Damon.  \"You say you had  the map this morning, and certainly none of them has been in our camp  since dawn, though of course it is possible that some of them sneaked  in during the night.\"    \"It does seem a mystery how it could have been taken in open daylight,  while we were about camp together,\" said Tom.  \"But is the loss such a  grave one, Professor Bumper?\"    \"Very grave.  In fact I may say it is impossible to proceed with the  excavating without the map.\"    \"Then what are we to do?\" asked Ned.    \"We must get it back!\" declared Tom.    \"Yes,\" agreed the scientist, \"we can not work without it.  As soon as I  make a little further search, to make sure it could not have dropped in  some out-of-the-way place, I shall go over to Professor Beecher's camp  and demand that he give me back my property.\"    \"Suppose he says he hasn't taken it?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I'm sure he either took it personally, or one of his party did.  And yet I can't understand how they could have come here without our  seeing them,\" and the professor shook his head in puzzled despair.    A more detailed search did not reveal the missing map, and Mr. Damon  and his friend the scientist were on the point of departing for the  camp of their rivals, less than a mile away, when Tom had what really  amounted to an inspiration.    \"Look here, Professor!\" he cried.  \"Can you remember any of the details  of your map--say, for instance, where we ought to begin excavating to  get at the wonders of the underground city?\"    \"Well, Tom, I did intend to compare my map with the configuration of  the country about here.  There is a certain mountain which serves as a  landmark and a guide for a starting point.  I think that is it over  there,\" and the scientist pointed to a distant snow-capped peak.    The party had left the low and marshy land of the true jungle, and were  among the foothills, though all about them was dense forest and  underbush, which, in reality, was as much a jungle as the lower plains,  but was less wet.    \"The point where I believe we should start to dig,\" said the professor,  \"is near the spot where the top of the mountain casts a shadow when the  sun is one hour high.  At least that is the direction given in the old  manuscripts.  So, though we can do little without the map, we might  make a start by digging there.\"    \"No, not there!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"Why not?\"    \"Because we don't want to let Beecher's crowd know that we are on the  track of the idol of gold.\"    \"But they know anyhow, for they have the map,\" commented Ned, puzzled  by his chum's words.    \"Maybe not,\" said Tom slowly.  \"I think this is a time for a big bluff.  It may work and it may not.  Beecher's crowd either has the map or they  have not.  If they have it they will lose no time in trying to find the  right place to start digging and then they'll begin excavating.    \"Very good! If they do that we have a right to dig near the same place.  But if they have not the map, which is possible, and if we start to dig  where the professor's memory tells him is the right spot, we'll only  give them the tip, and they'll dig there also.\"    \"I'm sure they have the map,\" the professor said.  \"But I believe your  plan is a good one, Tom.\"    \"Just what do you propose doing?\" asked Ned.    \"Fooling 'em!\" exclaimed Tom quickly.  \"We'll dig in some place remote  from the spot where the mountain casts its shadow.  They will think, if  they haven't the map, that we are proceeding by it, and they'll dig,  too.  When they find nothing, as will also happen to us, they may go  away.    \"If, on the other hand, they have the map, and see us digging at a spot  not indicated on it, they will be puzzled, knowing we must have some  idea of where the buried city lies.  They will think the map is at  fault, perhaps, and not make use of it.  Then we can get it back.\"    \"Bless my hatband!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"I believe you're right, Tom.  We'll dig in the wrong place to fool 'em.\"    And this was done.  Search for the precious map was given up for the  time being, and the professor and his friends set the natives to work  digging shafts in the ground, as though sinking them down to the level  of the buried city.    But though this false work was prosecuted with vigor for several days,  there was a feeling of despair among the Bumper party over the loss of  the map.    \"If we could only get it back!\" exclaimed the professor, again and  again.    Meanwhile the Beecher party seemed inactive.  True, some members of it  did come over to look on from a respectful distance at what the diggers  were doing.  Some of the rival helpers, under the direction of the head  of the expedition, also began sinking shafts.  But they were not in the  locality remembered by Professor Bumper as being correct.    \"I can't imagine what they're up to,\" he said.  \"If they have my map  they would act differently, I should think.\"    \"Whatever they're up to,\" answered Tom, \"the time has come when we can  dig at the place where we can hope for results.\"  And the following day  shafts were started in the shadow of the mountain.    Until some evidence should have been obtained by digging, as to the  location beneath the surface of a buried city, there was nothing for  the travelers to do but wait.  Turns were taken in directing the  efforts of the diggers, and an occasional inspection was made of the  shafts.    \"What do you expect to find first?\" asked Tom of Professor Bumper one  day, when the latter was at the top of a shaft waiting for a bucket  load of dirt to be hoisted up.    \"Potsherds and artifacts,\" was the answer.    \"What sort of bugs are they?\" asked Ned with a laugh.  He and Tom were  about to go hunting with their electric rifles.    \"Artifacts are things made by the Indians--or whatever members of the  race who built the ancient cities were called--such as household  articles, vases, ornaments, tools and so on.  Anything made by  artificial means is called an artifact.\"    \"And potsherds are things with those Chinese laundry ticket scratches  on them,\" added Tom.    \"Exactly,\" said the professor, laughing.  \"Though some of the  strange-appearing inscriptions give much valuable information.  As soon  as we find some of them--say a broken bit of pottery with hieroglyphics  on--I will know I am on the right track.\"    And while the scientist and Mr. Damon kept watch at the top of the  shaft, Tom and Ned went out into the jungle to hunt.  They had killed  some game, and were stalking a fine big deer, which would provide a  feast for the natives, when suddenly the silence of the lonely forest  was broken by a piercing scream, followed by an agonized cry of  \"El tigre! El tigre!\"          CHAPTER XIX    POISONED ARROWS      \"Did you hear that, Tom?\" asked Ned, in a hoarse whisper.    \"Surely,\" was the cautious answer.  \"Keep still, and I'll try for a  shot.\"    \"Better be quick,\" advised Ned in a tense voice.  \"The chap who did  that yelling seems to be in trouble!\"    And as Ned's voice trailed off into a whisper, again came the cry, this  time in frenzied pain.    \"El tigre! El tigre!\" Then there was a jumble of words.    \"It's over this way!\" and this time Ned shouted, seeing no need for low  voices since the other was so loud.    Tom looked to where Ned had parted the bushes alongside a jungle path.  Through the opening the young inventor saw, in a little glade, that  which caused him to take a firmer grip on his electric rifle, and also  a firmer grip on his nerves.    Directly in front of him and Ned, and not more than a hundred yards  away, was a great tawny and spotted jaguar--the \"tigre\" or tiger of  Central America.  The beast, with lashing tail, stood over an Indian  upon whom it seemed to have sprung from some lair, beating the  unfortunate man to the ground.  Nor had he fallen scatheless, for there  was blood on the green leaves about him, and it was not the blood of  the spotted beast.    \"Oh, Tom, can you--can you----\" and Ned faltered.    The young inventor understood the unspoken question.    \"I think I can make a shot of it without hitting the man,\" he answered,  never turning his head.  \"It's a question, though, if the beast won't  claw him in the death struggle.  It won't last long, however, if the  electric bullet goes to the right place, and I've got to take the  chance.\"    Cautiously Tom brought his weapon to bear.  Quiet as Ned and he had  been after the discovery, the jaguar seemed to feel that something was  wrong.  Intent on his prey, for a time he had stood over it, gloating.  Now the brute glanced uneasily from side to side, its tail nervously  twitching, and it seemed trying to gain, by a sniffing of the air, some  information as to the direction in which danger lay, for Tom and Ned  had stooped low, concealing themselves by a screen of leaves.    The Indian, after his first frenzied outburst of fear, now lay quiet,  as though fearing to move, moaning in pain.    Suddenly the jaguar, attracted either by some slight movement on the  part of Ned or Tom, or perhaps by having winded them, turned his head  quickly and gazed with cruel eyes straight at"]]]
