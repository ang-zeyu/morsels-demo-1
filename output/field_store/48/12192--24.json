And we have  made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air  wherever we wish to go.\"        202    \"Very good!\" said the Thing. \"As I am not a Gump, I cannot have a Gump's  pride or independent spirit. So I may as well become your servant as  anything else. My only satisfaction is that I do not seem to have a very  strong constitution, and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery.\"    \"Don't say that, I beg of you!\" cried the Tin Woodman, whose excellent heart  was strongly affected by this sad speech.\" Are you not feeling well today?\"    \"Oh, as for that,\" returned the Gump, \"it is my first day of existence; so I  cannot Judge whether I am feeling well or ill.\" And it waved its broom tail  to and fro in a pensive manner.    \"Come, come!\" said the Scarecrow, kindly. \"do try, to be more cheerful and  take life as you find it. We shall be kind masters, and will strive to  render your existence as pleasant as possible. Are you willing to carry us  through the air wherever we wish to go?\"    \"Certainly,\" answered the Gump. \"I greatly prefer to navigate the air. For  should I travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species, my  embarrassment would be something awful!\"    \"I can appreciate that,\" said the Tin Woodman, sympathetically.    \"And yet,\" continued the Thing, \"when I carefully        203  look you over, my masters, none of you seems to be constructed much more  artistically than I am.\"    \"Appearances are deceitful,\" said the Woggle-Bug, earnestly. \"I am both  Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated.\"    \"Indeed!\" murmured the Gump, indifferently.    \"And my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens,\" added the  Scarecrow, proudly.    \"How strange!\" remarked the Gump.    \"Although I am of tin,\" said the Woodman, \"I own a heart altogether the  warmest and most admirable in the whole world.\"    \"I'm delighted to hear it,\" replied the Gump, with a slight cough.    \"My smile,\" said Jack Pumpkinhead, \"is worthy your best attention. It is  always the same.\"    \"Semper idem,\" explained the Woggle-Bug, pompously; and the Gump turned to  stare at him.    \"And I,\" declared the Saw-Horse, filling in an awkward pause, \"am only  remarkable because I can't help it.\"    \"I am proud, indeed, to meet with such exceptional masters,\" said the Gump,  in a careless tone. \"If I could but secure so complete an introduction to  myself, I would be more than satisfied.\"    \"That will come in time,\" remarked the Scare-        204  crow. \"To 'Know Thyself' is considered quite an accomplishment, which it has  taken us, who are your elders, months to perfect. But now,\" he added,  turning to the others, \"let us get aboard and start upon our journey.\"    \"Where shall we go?\" asked Tip, as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and  assisted the Pumpkinhead to follow him.    \"In the South Country rules a very delightful Queen called Glinda the Good,  who I am sure will gladly receive us,\" said the Scarecrow, getting into the  Thing clumsily. \"Let us go to her and ask her advice.\"    \"That is cleverly thought of,\" declared Nick Chopper, giving the Woggle-Bug  a boost and then toppling the Saw-Horse into the rear end of the cushioned  seats.\" I know Glinda the Good, and believe she will prove a friend indeed.\"    \"Are we all ready?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes,\" announced the Tin Woodman, seating himself beside the Scarecrow.    \"Then,\" said Tip, addressing the Gump, \"be kind enough to fly with us to the  Southward; and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees, for it  makes me dizzy to be up so far.\"    \"All right,\" answered the Gump, briefly.        205    It flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air; and then, while  our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for  support, the Gump turned toward the South and soared swiftly and  majestically away.    \"The scenic effect, from this altitude, is marvelous,\" commented the  educated Woggle-Bug, as they rode along.    \"Never mind the scenery,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Hold on tight, or you may get  a tumble. The Thing seems to rock badly.'    \"It will be dark soon,\" said Tip, observing that the sun was low on the  horizon. \"Perhaps we should have waited until morning. I wonder if the Gump  can fly in the night.\"    \"I've been wondering that myself,\" returned the Gump quietly. \"You see, this  is a new experience to me. I used to have legs that carried me swiftly over  the ground. But now my legs feel as if they were asleep.\"    \"They are,\" said Tip. \"We didn't bring 'em to life.\"    \"You're expected to fly,\" explained the Scarecrow. \"not to walk.\"    \"We can walk ourselves,\" said the Woggle-Bug.\"    I begin to understand what is required of me,\" remarked the Gump; \"so I will  do my best to        206  please you,\" and he flew on for a time in silence.    Presently Jack Pumpkinhead became uneasy.    \"I wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins,\" he said.    \"Not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side,\" answered the  Woggle-Bug. \"In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin, for it  would become a squash.\"    \"Have I not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes?\" demanded Tip,  looking at the Woggle-Bug with a severe expression.    \"You have; and I've restrained a good many of them,\" replied the insect.  \"But there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language  that, to an educated person like myself, the temptation to express them is  almost irresistible.\"    \"People with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago,\"  said Tip.    \"Are you sure?\" asked the Woggle-Bug, with a startled look.    \"Of course I am,\" answered the boy. \"An educated Woggle-Bug may be a new  thing; but a Woggle-Bug education is as old as the hills, judging from the  display you make of it.\"    The insect seemed much impressed by this remark, and for a time maintained a  meek silence.        207    The Scarecrow, in shifting his seat, saw upon the cushions the pepper-box  which Tip had cast aside, and began to examine it.    \"Throw it overboard,\" said the boy; \"it's quite empty now, and there's no  use keeping it.\"    \"Is it really empty?\" asked the Scarecrow, looking curiously into the box.    \"Of course it is,\" answered Tip. \"I shook out every grain of the powder.    \"Then the box has two bottoms,\" announced the Scarecrow, \"for the bottom on  the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside.\"    \"Let me see,\" said the Tin Woodman, taking the box from his friend. \"Yes,\"  he declared, after looking it over, \"the thing certainly has a false bottom.  Now, I wonder what that is for?\"    \"Can't you get it apart, and find out?\" enquired Tip, now quite interested  in the mystery.    \"Why, yes; the lower bottom unscrews,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"My fingers are  rather stiff; please see if you can open it.\"    He handed the pepper-box to Tip, who had no difficulty in unscrewing the  bottom. And in the cavity below were three silver pills, with a carefully  folded paper lying underneath them.    This paper the boy proceeded to unfold, taking        208  care not to spill the pills, and found several lines clearly written in red  ink.    \"Read it aloud,\" said the Scarecrow. so Tip read, as follows:              \"DR. NIKIDIK'S CELEBRATED WISHING PILLS.    \"Directions for Use: Swallow one pill; count seventeen by twos; then make a  Wish.  -The Wish will immediately be granted.                 CAUTION: Keep in a Dry and Dark Place.\"      \"Why, this is a very valuable discovery!\" cried the Scarecrow.    \"It is, indeed,\" replied Tip, gravely. \"These pills may be of great use to  us. I wonder if old Mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepper-box. I  remember hearing her say that she got the Powder of Life from this same  Nikidik.\"    \"He must be a powerful Sorcerer!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman; \"and since the  powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills.\"    \"But how,\" asked the Scarecrow, \"can anyone count seventeen by twos?  Seventeen is an odd number.\"    \"That is true,\" replied Tip, greatly disappointed. \"No one can possibly  count seventeen by twos.\"    \"Then the pills are of no use to us,\" wailed the Pumpkinhead; \"and this fact  overwhelms me with        209  grief. For I had intended wishing that my head would never spoil.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the Scarecrow, sharply. \"If we could use the pills at all  we would make far better wishes than that.\"    \"I do not see how anything could be better,\" protested poor Jack. \"If you  were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety.\"    \"For my part,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"I sympathize with you in every  respect. But since we cannot count seventeen by twos, sympathy is all you  are liable to get.\"    By this time it had become quite dark, and the voyagers found above them a  cloudy sky, through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate.    The Gump flew steadily on, and for some reason the huge sofa-body rocked  more and more dizzily every hour.    The Woggle-Bug declared he was sea-sick; and Tip was also pale and somewhat  distressed. But the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem  to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out.    Darker and darker grew the night, and on and on sped the Gump through the  black heavens. The        210  travelers could not even see one another, and an oppressive silence settled  down upon them.    After a long time Tip, who had been thinking deeply, spoke.    \"How are we to know when we come to the pallace of Glinda the Good?\" he  asked.    \"It's a long way to Glinda's palace,\" answered the Woodman; \"I've traveled  it.\"    \"But how are we to know how fast the Gump is flying?\" persisted the boy. \"We  cannot see a single thing down on the earth, and before morning we may be  far beyond the place"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#18)"],[1,"of a gun, I will tell you the story of one.
