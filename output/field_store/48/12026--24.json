Some of  dem run away 'cause dey get tired of workin en if dey catch em, dey sho  whip em. Used to have to get ticket from boss or Missus to go any place  off de plantation widout you get punish for it. I hear tell 'bout de  overseer en de driver whip plenty of de slaves en some of de time, dey  would put em in de screw box over night. Sell em if dey didn' do like  dey tell em to do. Speculator come dere to buy slaves en dey sell em to  de highest bidder. I hear em say a certain one bring $1400 or $1500. I  know a man offered my boss $1000 for my brother, Joe, but he wouldn'  sell him.    \"My Massa would give me money now en den. First money I remember he give  me was 75c paper money. He tell me to check his horse en bring him up to  de yard en give me 75c en said, 'I can' carry you wid me dis mornin.' I  was 'bout 9 or 10 years old den. I stood up on de block en wondered why  he couldn' carry me en when I go back to de house, I see my Missus cryin  en she say, 'We won' see him no more.' When he come back, he shot  through de foot. He tell me to go to de blacksmith shop en bring  crutches. Den he went to de war again en when he come back, he was shot  on de right side of de neck. Give me a quarter in silver money dat time.  I ain' never been to de store fore den, but I go to de storekeeper en I  say, 'Mr. King, half dis money mine en half Joes.' I thought it was his  place to give me what I wanted en when I walk out, he say, 'Come back en  get your money,' I carried it home en give it to brother Joe en he give  it to pa en don' know what come of it after dat. Bought plug of tobacco  for pa wid de other money I had.    \"Our folks didn' get no learnin much nowhe' in dem days, but my Missus  sister child learn me right sharp. Dey was boardin at our house en when  I started to school, I didn' have no trouble. I remembers I found a  little book one time en man say he pay me 10c for it. Ma give me a  needle en thread en little sack en I sew my 10c in it. Put it in de  rafter en it stay dere till next Christmas. Believe I took it down en  tote it a long time fore man come by sellin tobacco en I bought piece en  give it to pa. Man give my sister bigger piece for a dime den he give  me.    \"De slaves what belong to my white folks have frolicsome days all  through de year. Go to frolic on Saturday en go to white folks church on  Sunday en sit in portion of church in de gallery. Den on Christmas eat  en drink de best liquor dere was en de Fourth of July de one day dat dey  have to go to [HW: Eutaw] Springs. Dey go in buggies en wagons en have  plenty of everything to eat dat day. I know dere was a battle up dere,  although I didn' never go wid em. Cotton pickin en corn shuckin days  won' no work times, dey was big frolics. De first one shuck red corn had  to tell who his best girl was en all dem things. All dem come to cotton  pickin dat want to en pick cotton en cook big dinner. Pick cotton till  'bout 5:30 in de evenin' en den knock off for de eats en de dancin. Go  to all de slaves weddings too. Dey would mostly get married 'bout on a  Sunday evenin'.    \"I was 'bout 15 year old when freedom come, but I don' remember much  'bout dat day. I remembers de Yankees come to de house one day. De white  folks had a bull dog tied in de smoke house en one Yankee hold de gun on  de dog en another take de meat out de house. Den dey come out en set  table en eat. Dog didn' try to bite em 'cause dog know when to bite.  Somebody ask em to have some rice en dey say, 'I would cut my throat  fore I eat dat thing.    \"I tell you de truth wid de treatment I been gettin I don' see why I  could fought slavery time. I lives here by myself en I used to get check  but check don' come no more en I just lives on what people gets me.  Government got woman bring me wood en bucket of water en niece give me  dis house en acre of land to live on my lifetime. Cook only one meal a  day 'cause I can' afford it. De water I got it ever since yesterday  mornin. Sunday mornin I had hominy en salt water fish en dat de last  time I had good meal. (Wednesday afternoon). Lady tell me dere ain'  gwine be no more checks. It be two months since I get check en lady come  en I tell her I hungry en she go to Gourdin en buy me two cans en loaf  of bread. Had two big watermelons en was saving one for Miss Lanes. Girl  come runnin in en say my niece house on fire en I go runnin to see 'bout  fire en my biggest watermelon gone. Dat de one I been saving for Miss  Lanes en den I wake up on Friday mornin en de other one gone. Next thing  I know, dey started on my late ones. One night woman come in patch en  thump en thump. I was standin at de peach tree in de patch en she have  one en when she get near me, she stoop down en pick another. I say, 'You  reckon dat one ripe?' She sho drop em en run dat time.    \"Thank you, sir, your kindness will not be forgotten. Dis here dozen  matches last me till next week.    \"Good-by. Yunnah come back.\"          Walter Long          *Interview with Walter Long, 83 years old*      *2440 Sumter Street, Columbia, S.C.*      --_Henry Grant, Columbia, S.C._    \"I's a little bit stiff, when I tries to git up, and sometimes when I's  walkin' I weaves and wobbles like a drunk person, but know all dat comes  from old age. I has been healthy and strong all my life. De onliest  trouble I has ever had in my life has been wid my teeth; they sho' has  been bad a long time, and now I has only one or two old snags left. I  don't want no store bought teeth nohow, 'cause they 'minds me of a hoss  or mule wid a bit in their mouth floppin' up and down. No sir, I don't  want them triflin' things botherin' me, I think I can take care of de  little I gits to eat wid dese few snags I has left.    \"Me and all my folks was slaves and b'longs to Master John Long, and his  wife, Betsy Long. Their plantation was six miles north of Chapin,  Lexington County, South Carolina. De plantation was a big one and lay  'long Saluda River. You know it had to be a big place 'cause master had  over three hundred slaves in all. Everything de slaves needed was made  right dere on de plantation; all de food 'cept sugar and coffee, and  what us need to wear, 'cept buttons for de clothes.    \"Master and mistress raised four fine boys, no girls I 'members 'bout.  De boys names was: West, Mid, Gradon and Hill. Master West and Mid  served as overseers on de plantation. Dese boys being de overseers, was  de whole reason us slaves was treated good and kind. They knowed us  slave would b'long to them some day, when old Master John died. De  slaves never worked hard, and they was give every Saturday and Sunday to  rest.    \"Our food in slavery time was good and a lot of it. De food was cooked  good and prepared for us by servants dat didn't do nothin' else but  'tend to de food dat de rest of de slaves had to eat. When us had beef  us went to de pasture for it; when us had pork, us went to de hog lot.  De cabbage and turnips come from de garden and field dere at home, and  when us was eatin' them us knowed they didn't come from out yonder, like  de stuff us has to eat dese days.    \"De houses us slaves lived in was built of logs and then de logs was  covered over inside and out wid plank, dat made them tight and warm.  Every family was furnished plenty of covering, so they wouldn't suffer  in cold weather but in summer de most of us slept on pallets on de  floor.    \"Master John was a business man, but he never got too busy to be polite  and gentle to mistress. Both of them has good schoolin'. They knowed  just how to treat both their slaves and their white friends. They was  good to all, and they never turnt anybody down dat come to them for  help. Many was de poor white folks dat 'most lived on Master John. They  was what I calls, real white folks; no sich people is easy found dese  days by de poor niggers.    \"Mistress was mighty 'ticular 'bout our 'ligion, 'cause she knowed dere  was no nigger any too good nohow. Us slaves 'sorbed all de good us had  in us from our mistress, I really believes. She was so kind and gentle,  she moved 'mong us a livin' benediction. Many was de blessings dat fell  from her hands for de sick and 'flicted. She got tired, but I has never  seen her too weary to go to a cryin' child or a moanin' grown person on  de place and 'quire what was de matter. Us was 'bliged to love her,  'cause she knowed us more better than us knowed ourselves. More than  dat, she and her sons' wives teached us how to read, write and figure,  'nough to help us in small business.    \"When did I git married? I wish you hadn't ask dat question. I sho' had  a bad mixup wid my first gal. You see it was dis way: I was good grown  befo' I left my daddy and mammy who was then farmin' for Master Mid  Long, on the other side of Saluda River. My mammy had a heap of sense  dat she got from de white folks. So, one day while me and she was  pickin' cotton out in de field she all at once stopped pickin' cotton,  straightened up, pointed her finger at me and said: 'Look here nigger,  you knows I don't like for you to be gwine to see dat brown skin gal  what lives over yonder on Cling Creek. After I has raised you up de best  I knowed how and then for you to do like you is, foolin' your time 'way  wid such sorry women makes your old mammy sick and mad all over. One  other thing I wants to say to you is dat some of dese nights when you go  to see dat gal, you is gwine to see something dat is sho' goin' to call  to your mind what I's sayin' to you.' Well boss, you know how 'tis wid  men. I knowed mammy could give good 'vice, and I knowed she sho'  wouldn't do me no harm. But what 'bout dat I's gwine to see some nights  when I go to see dat gal? So I thinks and thinks 'bout dat two or three  days and never did satisfy my mind what dat something gwine look like.    \"Late one evenin', close to sunset, several days after mammy said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36036"],[0,"Metabolic Adaptation to Climate and Distribution of the Raccoon Procyon Lotor (#18)"],[1,"Consumption, Evaporative Water Loss             and Heart Rate in the Fennec. _Comparative Biochemistry             and Physiology_, 62A:585-592, 6 figures, 5 tables.
