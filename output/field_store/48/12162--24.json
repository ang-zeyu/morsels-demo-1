The back wings were similar to the female's, only of stronger  colour, and more distinct markings; the eye-spot and lining appeared  as if they had been tinted with strong fresh paint, while the edges  of the wings lying beside the abdomen had the long, silken hairs of  a pure, beautiful red their entire length:    A few rods away men were ploughing in the adjoining corn field, and  I remembered that the caterpillar of this moth liked to feed on corn  blades, and last summer undoubtedly lived in that very  field.  When  I studied Io history in my moth books, I learned these caterpillars  ate willow, wild cherry, hickory, plum, oak, sassafras, ash, and poplar.  The caterpillar was green, more like the spiny butterfly caterpillars  than any moth one I know.  It had brown and white bands, brown patches,  and was covered with tufts of stiff upstanding spines that pierced  like sharp needles.  This was not because the caterpillar tried to  hurt you, but because the spines were on it, and so arranged that if  pressed against, an acid secretion sprang from their base.  This  spread over the flesh the spines touched, stinging for an hour like  smartweed, or nettles.    When I identified this caterpillar in my books, it came to me that  I had known and experienced its touch.  But it did not forcibly  impress me until that instant that I knew it best of all, and that  it was my childhood enemy of the corn.  Its habit was to feed on  the young blades, and cling to them with all its might.  If I was  playing Indian among the rows, or hunting an ear with especially  long, fine 'silk' for a make-believe doll, or helping the cook  select ears of Jersey Sweet to boil for dinner, and accidentally  brushed one of these caterpillars with cheek or hand, I felt its  burning sting long afterward.  So I disliked those caterpillars.    For I always had played among the corn.  Untold miles I have  ridden the plough horses across the spring fields, where mellow  mould rolled black from the shining shares, and the perfumed air  made me feel so near flying that all I seemed to need was a high  start to be able to sail with the sentinel blackbird, that perched  on the big oak, and with one sharp 'T'check!' warned his feeding  flock, surely and truly, whether a passing man carried a gun or  a hoe.  Then came the planting, when bare feet loved the cool  earth, and trotted over other untold miles, while little fingers  carefully counted out seven grains from the store carried in my  apron skirt, as I chanted:    \"One for the blackbird, one for the crow;  One for the cutworm and four to grow.\"    Then father covered them to the right depth, and stamped each hill  with the flat of the hoe, while we talked of golden corn bread,  and slices of mush, fried to a crisp brown that cook would make in  the fall.  We had to plant enough more to feed all the horses, cattle,  pigs, turkeys, geese, and chickens, during the long winter, even if  the sun grew uncomfortably warm, and the dinner bell was slow about  ringing.    Then there were the Indian days in the field, when a fallen eagle  feather stuck in a braid, and some pokeberry juice on the face,  transformed me into the Indian Big Foot, and I fled down green  aisles of the corn before the wrath of the mighty Adam Poe.  At  times Big Foot grew tired fleeing, and said so in remarkably  distinct English, and then to keep the game going, my sister Ada,  who played Adam Poe, had to turn and do the fleeing or be  tomahawked with a stick.    When the milk was in the ears, they were delicious steamed over  salted water, or better yet roasted before coals at the front of  the cooking stove, and eaten with butter and salt, if you have  missed the flavour of it in that form, really you never have known  corn!    Next came the cutting days.  These were after all the caterpillars  had climbed down, and travelled across the fence to spin their  cocoons among the leaves of the woods; as if some instinct warned  them that they would be ploughed up too early to emerge, if they  remained in the field.  The boys bent four hills, lashed the tassels  together for a foundation, and then with one sweep of their knives,  they cut a hill at a time, and stacked it in large shocks, that lined  the field like rows of sentinels, guarding the gold of pumpkin and  squash lying all around.  While the shocks were drying, the squirrels,  crows, and quail took possession, and fattened their sides against  snow time.    Then the gathering days of October--they were the best days of all!  Like a bloom-outlined vegetable bed, the goldenrod and ironwort,  in gaudy border, filled the fence corners of the big fields.  A  misty haze hung in the air, because the Indians were burning the  prairies to round up game for winter.  The cawing of the crows,  the chatter of blackbirds, and the piping bob-whites, sounded so  close and so natural out there, while the crowing cocks of the  barnyard seemed miles away and slightly  unreal.  Grown up and  important, I sat on a board laid across the wagon bed, and guided  the team of matched greys between the rows of shocks, and around  the 'pie-timber' as my  brother Leander called the pumpkins while  father and the boys opened the shocks and husked the ears.  How the squirrels scampered to the woods and to the business of  storing away the hickory nuts that we could hear rattling down  every frosty morning!  We hurried with the corn; because as soon  as the last shock was in, we might take the horses, wagon, and  our dinner, and go all day to the woods, where we gathered our  winter store of nuts.  Leander would take a gun along, and shoot  one of those saucy  squirrels for the little sick mother.    Last came the November night, when the cold had shut us in.  Then  selected ears that had been dried in the garret were brought down,  white for 'rivel' and to roll things in to fry, and yellow for  corn bread and mush.  A tub full of each was shelled, and sacked  to carry to the mill the following day.  I sat on the floor while  father and the boys worked, listening to their talk, as I built  corncob castles so high they toppled from their many stories.  Sometimes father made cornstock fiddles that would play a real  tune.  Oh! the pity of it that every little child cannot grow,  live, learn and love among the corn.  For the caterpillars never  stopped the fun, even the years when they were most numerous.    The eggs laid by my female never hatched, so I do not know this  caterpillar in its early stages from experience, but I had enough  experience with it in my early  stages, that I do not care if I  never raise one.  No doubt it attains maturity by the same series  of moults as the others, and its life history is quite similar.  The full-fed caterpillars spin among the leaves on the ground,  and with their spines in mind, I would much prefer finding a cocoon,  and producing a moth from that stage of its evolution.    The following season I had the good fortune to secure a male and  female Io at the same time and by persistence induced them to pose  for me on an apple branch.  There was no trouble in securing the  male as I desired him, with wings folded showing the spots, lining  and flushing of colour.  But the female was a perverse little body  and though I tried patiently and repeatedly she would not lower  her wings full width.  She climbed around with them three-fourths  spread, producing the most beautiful effect of life, but failing to  display her striking markings.  This is the one disadvantage in  photographing moths from life.  You secure lifelike effects but  sometimes you are forced to sacrifice their wonderful decorations.      CHAPTER IX  The Sweetheart and the Bride: Catocala              Amatyix--Catocala Neogama      There are no moths so common with us as these, for throughout their  season, at any time one is wanted, it is sure to be found either  on the sweetbrier clambering over the back wall, among the  morning-glories on one side, the wistaria and wild grape on the other,  or in the shade of the wild clematis in front.  On very sunny days,  they leave the shelter of the vines, and rest on the logs of the  Cabin close the roof of the verandas.  Clinging there they appear  like large grey flies, for they are of peculiar shape, and the  front wings completely cover the back when in repose.  A third or  a half of the back wings show as they are lifted to balance the  the moths when walking over vines and uncertain footing.  They are  quite conspicuous on our Cabin, because it is built of the red cedar  of Wisconsin; were it of the timber used by our grandfathers, these  moths with folded wings would be almost indistinguishable from their  surroundings.    Few moths can boast greater beauty.  The largest specimen of the  'Sweetheart' that homes with us would measure three and one half  inches if it would spread its wings full width as do the moths of  other species.  No moth is more difficult to describe, because of  the delicate blending of so many intangible shades.  The front wings  are a pale, brownish grey, with irregular markings of tan, and dark  splotches outlined with fine deep brown lines.  The edges are fluted  and escalloped, each raised place being touched with a small spot of  tan, and above it a narrow escalloped line of brown.  The back wings  are bright red, crossed by a circular band of brownish black,  three-fourths of an inch from the base, a secondary wider band of  the same, and edged with pale yellow.    There is no greater surprise in store for a student of moths than  to locate a first Catocala Amatrix, and see the softly blended  grey front wings suddenly lift, and the vivid red of the back  ones flash out.  The under sides of the front wings are a warm  creamy tan, crossed by wide bands of dark brown and grey-brown,  ending in a delicate grey mist at the edges.  The back wings are  the same tan shade, with red next the abdomen, and crossed by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#18)"],[1,"great strength. My attention was particularly directed to  him from this circumstance, and as I was on the extreme flank of the  grenadiers, and close to Captain de Haldimar, had every opportunity of  observing his movements principally pointed at that officer. He first  discharged a carbine, the ball of which killed a man of the company at  his (Captain de Haldimar's) side; and then, with evident rage at having  been defeated in his aim, he took a pistol from his belt, and advancing  with rapid strides to within a few paces of his intended victim,  presented it in the most deliberate manner. At that moment, gentlemen,  (and it was but the work of a moment,) a thousand confused and almost  inexplicable feelings rose to my heart. The occasion I had long sought  was at length within my reach; but even the personal considerations,  which had hitherto influenced my mind, were sunk in the anxious desire  I entertained to preserve the life of an officer so universally  beloved, and so every way worthy of the sacrifice. While yet the pistol  remained levelled, I sprang before Captain de Haldimar, received the  ball in my breast, and had just strength sufficient to fire my musket  at this formidable enemy when I sank senseless to the earth.    \"It will not be difficult for you, gentlemen, who have feeling minds,  to understand the pleasurable pride with which, on being conveyed to  Captain de Haldimar's own apartments in Quebec, I found myself almost  overwhelmed by the touching marks of gratitude showered on me by his  amiable relatives. Miss Clara de Haldimar, in particular, like a  ministering angel, visited my couch of suffering at almost every hour,  and always provided with some little delicacy, suitable to my  condition, of which I had long since tutored myself to forget even the  use. But what principally afforded me pleasure, was to remark the  consolations which she tendered to my poor drooping Ellen, who, already  more than half subdued by the melancholy change in our condition in  life, frequently spent hours together in silent grief at the side of my  couch, and watching every change in my countenance with all the intense  anxiety of one who feels the last stay on earth is about to be severed  for ever. Ah! how I then longed to disclose to this kind and  compassionating being the true position of her on whom she lavished her  attention, and to make her known, not as the inferior honored by her  notice, but as the equal alike worthy of her friendship and deserving  of her esteem; but the wide, wide barrier that divided the wife of the  private soldier from the daughter and sister of the commissioned  officer sealed my lips, and our true condition continued unrevealed.    \"Gentlemen,\" resumed Halloway, after a short pause, \"if I dwell on  these circumstances, it is with a view to show how vile are the charges  preferred against me. Is it likely, with all the incentives to good  conduct I have named, I should have proved a traitor to my country?  And, even if so, what to gain, I would ask; and by what means was a  correspondence with the enemy to be maintained by one in my humble  station? As for the second charge, how infamous, how injurious is it to  my reputation, how unworthy to be entertained! From the moment of my  recovery from that severe wound, every mark of favour that could be  bestowed on persons in our situation had been extended to my wife and  myself, by the family of Colonel de Haldimar; and my captain, knowing  me merely as the simple and low born Frank Halloway, although still the  preserver of his life, has been unceasing in his exertions to obtain  such promotion as he thought my conduct generally, independently of my  devotedness to his person, might claim. How these applications were  met, gentlemen, I have already stated; but notwithstanding Colonel de  Haldimar has never deemed me worthy of the promotion solicited, that  circumstance could in no way weaken my regard and attachment for him  who had so often demanded it. How then, in the name of heaven, can a  charge so improbable, so extravagant, as that of having been  instrumental in the abduction of Captain de Haldimar, be entertained?  and who is there among you, gentlemen, who will for one moment believe  I could harbour a thought so absurd as that of lending myself to the  destruction of one for whom I once cheerfully offered up the sacrifice  of my blood? And now,\" pursued the prisoner, after another short pause,  \"I come to the third charge,--that charge which most affects my life,  but impugns neither my honour nor my fidelity. That God, before whom I  know I shall shortly appear, can attest the sincerity of my statement,  and before him do I now solemnly declare what I am about to relate is  true.    \"Soon after the commencement of my watch last night, I heard a voice  distinctly on the outside of the rampart, near my post, calling in a  low and subdued tone on the name of Captain de Haldimar. The accents,  hastily and anxiously uttered, were apparently those of a female. For a  moment I continued irresolute how to act, and hesitated whether or not  I should alarm the garrison; but, at length, presuming it was some  young female of the village with whom my captain was acquainted, it  occurred to me the most prudent course would be to apprize that officer  himself. While I yet hesitated whether to leave my post for a moment  for the purpose, a man crossed the parade a few yards in my front; it  was Captain de Haldimar's servant, Donellan, then in the act of  carrying some things from his master's apartment to the guard-room. I  called to him, to say the sentinel at the gate wished to see the  captain of the guard immediately. In the course of a few minutes he  came up to my post, when I told him what I had heard. At that moment,  the voice again repeated his name, when he abruptly left me and turned  to the left of the gate, evidently on his way to the rampart. Soon  afterwards I heard Captain de Haldimar immediately above me, sharply  calling out 'Hist, hist!' as if the person on the outside, despairing  of success, was in the act of retreating. A moment or two of silence  succeeded, when a low conversation ensued between the parties. The  distance was so great I could only distinguish inarticulate sounds; yet  it seemed to me as if they spoke not in English, but in the language of  the Ottawa Indians, a tongue with which, as you are well aware,  gentlemen, Captain de Haldimar is familiar. This had continued about  ten minutes, when I again heard footsteps hastily descending the  rampart, and moving in the direction of the guard-house. Soon  afterwards Captain de Haldimar re-appeared at my post, accompanied by  his servant Donellan; the former had the keys of the gate in his hand,  and he told me that he must pass to the skirt of the forest on some  business of the last importance to the safety of the garrison.    \"At first I peremptorily refused, stating the severe penalty attached  to the infringement of an order, the observation of which had so  especially been insisted upon by the governor, whose permission,  however, I ventured respectfully to urge might, without difficulty, be  obtained, if the business was really of the importance he described it.  Captain de Haldimar, however, declared he well knew the governor would  not accord that permission, unless he was positively acquainted with  the nature and extent of the danger to be apprehended; and of these, he  said, he was not himself sufficiently aware. All argument of this  nature proving ineffectual, he attempted to enforce his authority, not  only in his capacity of officer of the guard, but also as my captain,  ordering me, on pain of confinement, not to interfere with or attempt  to impede his departure. This, however, produced no better result; for  I knew that, in this instance, I was amenable to the order of the  governor alone, and I again firmly refused to violate my duty.    \"Finding himself thwarted in his attempt to enforce my obedience,  Captain de Haldimar, who seemed much agitated and annoyed by what he  termed my obstinacy, now descended to entreaty; and in the name of that  life which I had preserved to him, and of that deep gratitude which he  had ever since borne to me, conjured me not to prevent his departure.  'Halloway,' he urged, 'your life, my life, my father's life,--the life  of my sister Clara perhaps, who nursed you in illness, and who has ever  treated your wife with attention and kindness,--all these depend upon  your compliance with my request. 'Hear me,' he pursued, following up  the impression which he clearly perceived he had produced in me by this  singular and touching language: 'I promise to be back within the hour;  there is no danger attending my departure, and here will I be before  you are relieved from your post; no one can know I have been absent,  and your secret will remain with Donellan and myself. Do you think,' he  concluded, 'I would encourage a soldier of my regiment to disobey a  standing order of the garrison, unless there was some very  extraordinary reason for my so doing? But there is no time to be lost  in parley. Halloway! I entreat you to offer no further opposition to my  departure. I pledge myself to be back before you are relieved.'\"    \"Gentlemen,\" impressively continued the prisoner, after a pause, during  which each member of the court seemed to breathe for the first time, so  deeply had the attention of all been riveted by the latter part of this  singular declaration, \"how, under these circumstances, could I be  expected to act? Assured by Captain de Haldimar, in the most solemn  manner, that the existence of those most dear to his heart hung on my  compliance with his request, how could I refuse to him, whose life I  had saved, and whose character I so much esteemed, a boon so earnestly,  nay, so imploringly solicited? I acceded to his prayer, intimating, at  the same time, if he returned not"]]]
