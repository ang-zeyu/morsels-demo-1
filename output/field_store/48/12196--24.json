She must save the girl,  she must seek help, for Mandane's bosom still faintly rose and fell  under Paula's tremulous fingers.    The freedman's brave heart would not allow him to fly to leave her with  the injured girl; he flung his shoes on the floor, raised the senseless  form, and propped it against one of the columns that stood round the  hall. It was not till his mistress had repeated her orders that he  hurried away. Paula watched him depart; as soon as she heard the  heavy door of the atrium close upon him, heedless of her own  suspicious-looking position, she shouted for help, so loudly that her  cries rang through the nocturnal silence of the house, and in a few  minutes, from this side and that, a slave, a maid, a clerk, a cook, a  watchman, came hurrying in.    Foremost of all--so soon indeed that he must have been on his way when  he heard her cry--came Orion. He wore a light night-dress, intended, so  she said to herself, to give the wretch the appearance of having sprung  out of bed. But was this indeed he? Was this man with a flushed face,  staring eyes, disordered hair and hoarse voice, that favorite of fortune  whose happy nature, easy demeanor, sunny gaze and enchanting song had  bewitched her soul? His hand shook as he came close to her and the  injured slave; and how forced and embarrassed was his enquiry as to what  had happened; how scared he looked as he asked her what had brought her  into this part of the house at such an hour.    She made no reply; but when his mother repeated the question soon after,  in a sharp voice, she--she who had never in her life told a lie--said  with hasty decision: \"I could not sleep, and the bark of the dog and a  cry for help brought me here.\"    \"I call that having sharp ears!\" retorted Neforis with an incredulous  shrug. \"For the future, at any rate, under similar circumstances  you need not be so prompt. How long, pray, have young girls trusted  themselves alone when murder is cried?\"    \"If you had but armed yourself, fair daughter of heroes!\" added Orion;  but he had no sooner spoken than he bitterly regretted it. What a glance  Paula cast at him! It was more than she could bear to hear him address  her in jest, almost in mockery: him of all men, and at this moment for  the first time--and to be thus reminded of her father! She answered  proudly and with cutting sharpness: \"I leave weapons to fighting men and  murderers!\"    \"To fighting men, and murderers!\" repeated Orion, pretending not to  understand the point of her words. He forced a smile; but then, feeling  that he must make some defence, he added bitterly: \"Really, that sounds  like the utterance of a feeble-hearted damsel! But let me beg you to  come closer and be calm. These pitiable gashes on the poor creature's  shoulder--I care more about her than you do, take my word for it--were  inflicted by a four-footed assassin, whose weapons were given by nature.  Yes, that is what happened. Rough old Beki keeps watch at the door of  the tablinum. What brought the poor child here I know not, but he caught  scent of her and pulled her down.\"    \"Or nothing of the kind!\" interrupted Neforis, picking up a pair of  man's shoes which lay on the ground by the sufferer.    Orion turned as pale as death and hastily took the shoes from his  mother's hand; he would have liked to fling them up and away through the  open roof. How came they here? Whose were they? Who had been here this  night? Before going into the tablinum he had locked the outer door on  that side, and had returned subsequently to open it again for the people  in the court-yard. It was not till after he had done this that the crazy  girl had rushed upon him; she must have been lurking somewhere about  when he first went through the atrium but had not then found courage  enough to place herself in his way. When she had thrown herself upon  him, the dog had pulled her down before he could prevent it: he would  certainly have sprung past her and have come to the rescue but that he  must thus have betrayed his visit to the tablinum.    It had required all his presence of mind to hurry to his room, fling on  his night garments, and rush back to the scene of disaster. When Paula  had first called for help he was already on his way, and with what  feelings! Never had he felt so bewildered, so confused, so deeply  dissatisfied with himself; for the first time in his life, as he stood  face to face with Paula, he dared not look straight into the eyes of his  fellow-man.    And now these shoes! The owner must have come there with the crazy girl,  and if he had seen him in the tablinum and betrayed what he was doing  there, how could he ever again appear in his parents' presence? He had  looked upon it as a good joke, but now it had turned to bitter earnest.  At any cost he must and would prevent his nocturnal doings from becoming  known! Some new wrong-doing-nay, the worst was preferable to a stain on  his honor.--Whose could the shoes be? He suddenly held them up on high,  crying with a loud voice: \"Do these shoes belong to any of you, you  people? To the gate-keeper perhaps?\"    When all were silent, and the porter denied the ownership, he stood  thinking; then he added with a defiant glare, and in a husky voice:  \"Then some one who had broken into the house has been startled and  dropped them. Our house-stamp is here on the leather: they were made in  our work-shop, and they still smell of the stable-here, Sebek, you  can convince yourself. Take them into your keeping, man; and tomorrow  morning we will see who has left this suspicious offering in our  vestibule.--You were the first to reach the spot, fair Paula. Did you  see a man about?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied with a hostile and challenging stare.    \"And which way did he go?\"    \"He fled across the viridarium like a coward, running across the  poor, well-kept grass-plot to save time, and vanished upstairs in the  dwelling-rooms.\"    Orion ground his teeth, and a mad hatred surged up in him of this  mystery in woman's form in whose power, as it seemed, his ruin lay, and  whose eyes mashed with revenge and the desire to undo him. What was  she plotting against him? Was there a being on earth who would dare to  accuse him, the spoilt favorite of great and small...? And her look had  meant more than aversion, it had expressed contempt.... How dare she  look so at him? Who in the wide world had a right to accuse him of  anything that could justify such a feeling? Never, never had he met with  enmity like this, least of all from a girl. He longed to annihilate the  high-handed, cold-hearted, ungrateful creature who could humble him so  outrageously after he had allowed her to see that his heart was hers,  and who could make him quail--a man whose courage had been proved a  hundred times. He had to exercise his utmost self-control not to forget  that she was a woman.--What had happened? What demon had been playing  tricks on him--What had so completely altered him within this half-hour  that his whole being seemed subverted even to himself, and that any one  dared to treat him so?    His mother at once observed the terrible change that came over her son's  face when Paula declared that a man had fled towards the dwelling-rooms;  but she accounted for it in her own way, and exclaimed in genuine alarm:  \"Towards the Nile-wing, the rooms where your father sleeps? Merciful  Heaven! suppose they have planned an attack there! Run--fly, Sebek.    \"Go across with some armed men! Search the whole house from top to  bottom! Perhaps you will catch the rascal--he had trodden down the  grass--you must find him--you must not let him escape.\"    The steward hurried off, but Paula begged the head gardener, who had  come in with the rest, to compare the foot-prints of the fugitive, which  must yet be visible on the damp grass, with the shoes; her heart  beat wildly, and again she tried to catch the young man's eye. Orion,  however, started forward and went into the viridarium, saying as he  went: \"That is my concern.\"    But he was ashamed of himself, and felt as if something tight was  throttling him. In his own eyes he appeared like a thief caught in the  act, a traitor, a contemptible rascal; and he began to perceive that he  was indeed no longer what he had been before he had committed that fatal  deed in the tablinum.    Paula breathed hard as she watched him go out. Had he sunk so low as to  falsify the evidence, and to declare that the groom's broad sole fitted  the tracks of his small and shapely feet? She hated him, and yet she  could have found it in her heart to pray that this, at least, he might  not do; and when he came back and said in some confusion that he could  not be sure, that the shoes did not seem exactly to fit the foot-marks,  she drew a breath of relief and turned again to the wounded girl and the  physician, who, had now made his appearance. Before Neforis followed her  example she drew Orion aside and anxiously asked him what ailed him, he  looked so pale and upset. He only said with some hesitation: \"That poor  girl's fate...\" and he pointed to the Persian slave.--\"It troubles me.\"    \"You are so soft-hearted--you were as a boy!\" said his mother  soothingly. She had seen the moisture sparkling in his eyes; but his  tears were not for the Persian, but for the mysterious something--he  himself knew not what to call it--that he had forfeited in this last  hour, and of which the loss gave him unspeakable pain.    But their dialogue was interrupted: the first misfortune of this  luckless night had brought its attendant: the body of Rustem, the  splendid and radiantly youthful Rustem, the faithful Persian leader  of the caravan, was borne into the hall, senseless. He had made some  satirical remark on the quarrel over creeds, and a furious Jacobite had  fallen upon him with a log of wood, and dealt him a deep and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#18)"],[1,"or cavalry, old  style.    He produced a telegraph form, like the policeman.    'Middle height--strongly built--grey tweeds--brown hat--speaks with a  colonial accent--much sunburnt. What's your name, sir?'    I did not reply in a colonial accent, but with the hauteur of the  British officer when stopped by a French sentry. I asked him again what  the devil he had to do with my business. This made him angry and he  began to stammer.    'I'll teach you what I have to do with it. I'm a deputy-lieutenant of  this county, and I have Admiralty instructions to watch the coast. Damn  it, sir, I've a wire here from the Chief Constable describing you.  You're Brand, a very dangerous fellow, and we want to know what the  devil you're doing here.'    As I looked at his wrathful eye and lean head, which could not have  held much brains, I saw that I must change my tone. If I irritated him  he would get nasty and refuse to listen and hang me up for hours. So my  voice became respectful.    'I beg your pardon, sir, but I've not been accustomed to be pulled up  suddenly, and asked for my credentials. My name is Blaikie, Captain  Robert Blaikie, of the Scots Fusiliers. I'm home on three weeks' leave,  to get a little peace after Hooge. We were only hauled out five days  ago.' I hoped my old friend in the shell-shock hospital at Isham would  pardon my borrowing his identity.    The man looked puzzled. 'How the devil am I to be satisfied about that?  Have you any papers to prove it?'    'Why, no. I don't carry passports about with me on a walking tour. But  you can wire to the depot, or to my London address.'    He pulled at his yellow moustache. 'I'm hanged if I know what to do. I  want to get home for dinner. I tell you what, sir, I'll take you on  with me and put you up for the night. My boy's at home, convalescing,  and if he says you're pukka I'll ask your pardon and give you a dashed  good bottle of port. I'll trust him and I warn you he's a keen hand.'    There was nothing to do but consent, and I got in beside him with an  uneasy conscience. Supposing the son knew the real Blaikie! I asked the  name of the boy's battalion, and was told the 10th Seaforths. That  wasn't pleasant hearing, for they had been brigaded with us on the  Somme. But Colonel Broadbury--for he told me his name--volunteered  another piece of news which set my mind at rest. The boy was not yet  twenty, and had only been out seven months. At Arras he had got a bit  of shrapnel in his thigh, which had played the deuce with the sciatic  nerve, and he was still on crutches.    We spun over ridges of moorland, always keeping northward, and brought  up at a pleasant white-washed house close to the sea. Colonel Broadbury  ushered me into a hall where a small fire of peats was burning, and on  a couch beside it lay a slim, pale-faced young man. He had dropped his  policeman's manner, and behaved like a gentleman. 'Ted,' he said, 'I've  brought a friend home for the night. I went out to look for a suspect  and found a British officer. This is Captain Blaikie, of the Scots  Fusiliers.'    The boy looked at me pleasantly. 'I'm very glad to meet you, sir.  You'll excuse me not getting up, but I've got a game leg.' He was the  copy of his father in features, but dark and sallow where the other was  blond. He had just the same narrow head, and stubborn mouth, and  honest, quick-tempered eyes. It is the type that makes dashing  regimental officers, and earns V.C.s, and gets done in wholesale. I was  never that kind. I belonged to the school of the cunning cowards.    In the half-hour before dinner the last wisp of suspicion fled from my  host's mind. For Ted Broadbury and I were immediately deep in 'shop'. I  had met most of his senior officers, and I knew all about their doings  at Arras, for his brigade had been across the river on my left. We  fought the great fight over again, and yarned about technicalities and  slanged the Staff in the way young officers have, the father throwing  in questions that showed how mighty proud he was of his son. I had a  bath before dinner, and as he led me to the bathroom he apologized very  handsomely for his bad manners. 'Your coming's been a godsend for Ted.  He was moping a bit in this place. And, though I say it that shouldn't,  he's a dashed good boy.'    I had my promised bottle of port, and after dinner I took on the father  at billiards. Then we settled in the smoking-room, and I laid myself  out to entertain the pair. The result was that they would have me stay  a week, but I spoke of the shortness of my leave, and said I must get  on to the railway and then back to Fort William for my luggage.    So I spent that night between clean sheets, and ate a Christian  breakfast, and was given my host's car to set me a bit on the road. I  dismissed it after half a dozen miles, and, following the map, struck  over the hills to the west. About midday I topped a ridge, and beheld  the Sound of Sleat shining beneath me. There were other things in the  landscape. In the valley on the right a long goods train was crawling  on the Mallaig railway. And across the strip of sea, like some fortress  of the old gods, rose the dark bastions and turrets of the hills of  Skye.        CHAPTER SIX    The Skirts of the Coolin    Obviously I must keep away from the railway. If the police were after  me in Morvern, that line would be warned, for it was a barrier I must  cross if I were to go farther north. I observed from the map that it  turned up the coast, and concluded that the place for me to make for  was the shore south of that turn, where Heaven might send me some luck  in the boat line. For I was pretty certain that every porter and  station-master on that tin-pot outfit was anxious to make better  acquaintance with my humble self.    I lunched off the sandwiches the Broadburys had given me, and in the  bright afternoon made my way down the hill, crossed at the foot of a  small fresh-water lochan, and pursued the issuing stream through  midge-infested woods of hazels to its junction with the sea. It was  rough going, but very pleasant, and I fell into the same mood of idle  contentment that I had enjoyed the previous morning. I never met a  soul. Sometimes a roe deer broke out of the covert, or an old blackcock  startled me with his scolding. The place was bright with heather, still  in its first bloom, and smelt better than the myrrh of Arabia. It was a  blessed glen, and I was as happy as a king, till I began to feel the  coming of hunger, and reflected that the Lord alone knew when I might  get a meal. I had still some chocolate and biscuits, but I wanted  something substantial.    The distance was greater than I thought, and it was already twilight  when I reached the coast. The shore was open and desolate--great banks  of pebbles to which straggled alders and hazels from the hillside  scrub. But as I marched northward and turned a little point of land I  saw before me in a crook of the bay a smoking cottage. And, plodding  along by the water's edge, was the bent figure of a man, laden with  nets and lobster pots. Also, beached on the shingle was a boat.    I quickened my pace and overtook the fisherman. He was an old man with  a ragged grey beard, and his rig was seaman's boots and a much-darned  blue jersey. He was deaf, and did not hear me when I hailed him. When  he caught sight of me he never stopped, though he very solemnly  returned my good evening. I fell into step with him, and in his silent  company reached the cottage.    He halted before the door and unslung his burdens. The place was a  two-roomed building with a roof of thatch, and the walls all grown over  with a yellow-flowered creeper. When he had straightened his back, he  looked seaward and at the sky, as if to prospect the weather. Then he  turned on me his gentle, absorbed eyes. 'It will haf been a fine day,  sir. Wass you seeking the road to anywhere?'    'I was seeking a night's lodging,' I said. 'I've had a long tramp on  the hills, and I'd be glad of a chance of not going farther.'    'We will haf no accommodation for a gentleman,' he said gravely.    'I can sleep on the floor, if you can give me a blanket and a bite of  supper.'    'Indeed you will not,' and he smiled slowly. 'But I will ask the wife.  Mary, come here!'    An old woman appeared in answer to his call, a woman whose face was so  old that she seemed like his mother. In highland places one sex ages  quicker than the other.    'This gentleman would like to bide the night. I wass telling him that  we had a poor small house, but he says he will not be minding it.'    She looked at me with the timid politeness that you find only in  outland places.    'We can do our best, indeed, sir. The gentleman can have Colin's bed in  the loft, but he will haf to be doing with plain food. Supper is ready  if you will come in now.'    I had a scrub with a piece of yellow soap at an adjacent pool in the  burn and then entered a kitchen blue with peat-reek. We had a meal of  boiled fish, oatcakes and skim-milk cheese, with cups of strong tea to  wash it down. The old folk had the manners of princes. They pressed  food on me, and asked me no questions, till for very decency's sake I  had to put up a story and give some account of myself.    I found they had a son in the Argylls and a young boy in the Navy. But  they seemed disinclined to talk of them or of the war. By a mere  accident I hit on the old man's absorbing interest. He was passionate  about the land. He had taken part in long-forgotten agitations, and had  suffered eviction in some ancient landlords' quarrel farther north.  Presently he was pouring out to me all the woes of the crofter--woes  that seemed so antediluvian and forgotten that I listened as one would  listen to an old song. 'You who come from a new country will not haf  heard of these things,' he kept telling me, but by that peat fire I  made up for my defective education. He told me of "]]]
