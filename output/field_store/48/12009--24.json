There is so much rationalism in their habitual  tactics, that one cannot help suspecting a touch of it in their beliefs.  And the truth is that their descendant, Garcilasso, has recorded certain  traditions to that effect, which he has perhaps dressed up a little too  much in European style, with a view to convincing us that his ancestors  were monotheistic philosophers, but which nevertheless bear the marks of  a certain authenticity. For the reasoning which Garcilasso puts into the  mouth of the Incas closely resembles what would naturally commend itself  to the mind of a pagan who should once ask himself whether the visible  phenomenon, the Sun, which he adored, was really as living, as  conscious, as personal, as they said. Thus the Inca Tupac Yupanqui  (fifteenth century) is said to have reasoned thus:[65]        \"They say that the Sun lives, and that he does everything. But      when one does anything, he is near to the thing he does; whereas      many things take place while the Sun is absent. It therefore      cannot be he who does everything. And again, if he were a living      being, would he not be wearied by his perpetual journeyings? If      he were alive, he would experience fatigue, as we do; and if he      were free, he would visit other parts of the heavens which he      never traverses. In truth, he seems like a thing held to its      task that always measures the same course, or like an arrow that      flies where it is shot and not where it wills itself.\"    Note this line of reasoning, Gentlemen, which must have repeated itself  in many minds when once they had acquired enough independence and power  of thought calmly to examine those natural phenomena which primitive  naivete had animated, personified and adored as the lords of destiny.  Their fixity and their mechanical and unvarying movements, when once  observed, could not fail to strike a mortal blow at the faith of which  they were the object. That faith was transformed without being radically  changed when it was no longer the phenomenon itself, but the personal  and directing spirit, the genius, the deity that was behind the  phenomenon, but distinct from it and capable of detaching itself from  it, which drew to itself the worship of the faithful. But in his turn  this god, shaped in the image of man, must either be refined into pure  spirit, or must fall below the rational and moral ideal ultimately  conceived by man himself. When all is said and done, Gentlemen, Buddhism  is still a religion of Nature. It is the last word of that order of  religions, and exists to show us that, at any rate in its authentic and  primitive form, that last word is _nothingness_. And that is why  Buddhism has never existed in its pure form as a popular religion. For  in religion, and at every stage of religion, mind seeks mind. Without  that, religion is nothing. Note, too, the observant Inca's remark, that  if the Sun were alive he must be dreadfully tired. You may find the same  idea in more than one European mythology, in which the Sun appears as an  unhappy culprit condemned to a toilsome service for some previous fault;  or, again, an iron constitution is given him, to explain why he is not  worn out by his ceaseless journeying.    Now Tupac Yupanqui would not be the only Inca who cherished a certain  scepticism concerning his ancestor the Sun. Herrera tells us that the  Inca Viracocha denied that the Sun was God;[66] and according to a story  preserved by Garcilasso,[67] the Inca Huayna Capac, the conqueror of  Quito, who died shortly after Pizarro's first disembarkment, must have  been quite as much of a rationalist. One day, during the celebration of  a festival in honour of the Sun, he is said to have gazed at the great  luminary so long and fixedly that the chief priest ventured on some  respectful remarks to the effect that so irreverent a proceeding must  surprise the people. \"I will ask you two questions,\" replied the  monarch. \"I am your king and universal lord. Would any one of you have  the hardihood to order me to rise from my seat and take a long journey  for his pleasure?... And would the richest and most powerful of my  vassals dare to disobey if I should command him on the spot to set out  in all speed for Chili?\" And when the priest answered in the negative,  the Inca continued: \"Then I tell you there must be a greater and a more  mighty lord above our father the Sun, who orders him to take the course  he follows day by day. For if he were himself the sovereign lord, he  would now and again omit his journey and rest, for his pleasure, even if  he experienced no necessity for doing so.\"    Once more: I will not vouch for the exact form of these audacious  speculations of the free-thinking Inca. But such reminiscences,  collected independently by various authors, correspond to the  conjectures forced upon us by the extreme political sagacity of the  Incas. None but theocrats, in whose own hearts faith in their central  principle was waning, could develop such astuteness and diplomacy. A  sincere and untried faith has not recourse to so many expedients  dictated by policy and the fear lest the joint in the armour should be  found. It is to be presumed, however, that these heterodox speculations  of the Incas themselves never passed beyond the narrow circle of the  family and its immediate surroundings. Nothing of the kind would ever be  caught by the ear of the people. But the evidence as to Huayna Capac's  scepticism derives a certain confirmation from the fact that he was the  first Inca who departed (to the woe of his empire, as it turned out)  from some of the hereditary maxims that had always been scrupulously  observed by his ancestors.    Huayna Capac had considerably extended the Peruvian empire by the  conquest of the kingdom of Quito. In the hope, presumably, of  consolidating his conquest, he resided for a long time in the  newly-acquired territory, and married the conquered king's daughter, to  whom he became passionately attached. This was absolutely contrary to  one of the statutes of the Inca family, no member of which was allowed  to marry a stranger. By his foreign wife he had a son called Atahualpa,  and whether it was that he thought it good policy to allow a certain  autonomy to the kingdom of Quito, or whether it was due to his  tenderness towards Atahualpa's mother and the son she had borne him,  certain it is that when he died at Quito in 1525, he decided that  Atahualpa should reign over this newly-acquired kingdom, whilst his  other son Huascar, the unimpeachably legitimate Inca, was to succeed him  as sovereign of Peru proper. This, again, was a violation of the maxim  that the kingdom of the Incas, which was the kingdom of the Sun, was  never to be parted. It was in the midst of the struggles provoked by the  hostility of the two brothers that Pizarro fell like a meteor amongst  the Peruvians, who did not so much as know of the existence of any other  land than the one they inhabited.    But the hour warns me that I must pause. When next we meet, I shall  have to recount the fall of the great religious dynasty of the Incas,  and we shall then examine more closely that Peruvian religion of which  we have to-day but sketched the outline.          LECTURE V.    FALL OF THE INCAS.--PERUVIAN MYTHOLOGY, PRIESTHOOD.      I.    LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    You will remember that when last we met we traced out the legendary  origin of the royal house of the Incas. Starting from the shores of the  Lake Titicaca and the city of Cuzco, and progressively extending its  combined religious and political dominion over the numerous countries  situated west of the Cordilleras, it had welded them into one vast  empire, centralized and organized in a way that, in spite of its  defects, extorts our admiration. You had occasion to notice the  extraordinary degree to which the consummate practical sagacity which  distinguished the sacerdotal and imperial family of the Sun for  successive centuries, was combined with purely mythological principles  of faith; and we were compelled to ask whether so much diplomacy was  really consistent with unreserved belief. Finally we saw that, according  to the historians, more than one of the Incas had in fact expressed and  justified a doubt as to the living and conscious personality of that  Sun-god whose descendants they were supposed to be. The position of  affairs when the Spaniards disembarked on the shores of Peru is already  known to you. The Inca Huayna Capac, conqueror of Quito, had broken with  the constitutional maxims of his dynasty, in the first place by marrying  a stranger, the daughter of a deposed king; and in the second place by  leaving the kingdom of Quito to the son, Atahualpa, whom she bore him;  while he allowed Huascar, the heir-apparent to the empire, to succeed  him in Peru proper, thus severing into two parts the kingdom of the Sun,  in defiance of the principle hitherto recognized, which forbad the  division of that kingdom under any circumstances.    The war which speedily arose between Atahualpa and his half-brother  Huascar was the great cause that made it possible for Pizarro and his  miniature army to get a footing in the Peruvian territory. The military  forces of both sections of the empire were engaged with each other far  away from the place of landing, and the inhabitants, wholly unaccustomed  to take any initiative, made no resistance to the strange invaders,  whose appearance, arms and horses, struck terror into their hearts, and  in whom (like the Mexicans in the case of Cortes and his followers) they  thought they saw supernatural beings. Pizarro, who knew how things  stood, had but one idea, viz., to imitate Cortes in laying hold of the  sovereign's person. Atahualpa returned victorious. He had defeated  Huascar, slaughtered many members of the Inca family, and thrown his  conquered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#18)"],[1," would have appreciably changed their position in the year, April  weather being due in March, according to the calendar. So, too, the year  under this arrangement did not consist of any integral number of months,  12 months of the average length of 29.5 days being 354 days, and 13  months 383.5 days, thus making any particular month change its position  from the beginning to the middle and the end of the year within a  comparatively short time. Some peoples gave up the astronomical year as  an independent unit and adopted a conventional year of 12 lunar months,  354 days, which is now in use in certain Mohammedan countries, where it  is known as the wandering year, with reference to the changing positions  of the seasons in such a year. Others held to the astronomical year and  adopted a system of conventional months, such that twelve of them would  just make up a year, as is done to this day in our own calendar, whose  months of arbitrary length we are compelled to remember by some such  jingle as the following:        \"Thirty days hath September,      April, June, and November;      All the rest have thirty-one      Save February,      Which alone hath twenty-eight,      Till leap year gives it twenty-nine.\"      61. THE CALENDAR.--The foundations of our calendar may fairly be  ascribed to Julius Cæsar, who, under the advice of the Egyptian  astronomer Sosigines, adopted the old Egyptian device of a leap year,  whereby every fourth year was to consist of 366 days, while ordinary  years were only 365 days long. He also placed the beginning of the year  at the first of January, instead of in March, where it had formerly  been, and gave his own name, Julius, to the month which we now call  July. August was afterward named in honor of his successor, Augustus.  The names of the earlier months of the year are drawn from Roman  mythology; those of the later months, September, October, etc., meaning  seventh month, eighth month, represent the places of these months in the  year, before Cæsar's reformation, and also their places in some of the  subsequent calendars, for the widest diversity of practice existed  during mediæval times with regard to the day on which the new year  should begin, Christmas, Easter, March 25th, and others having been  employed at different times and places.    The system of leap years introduced by Cæsar makes the average length of  a year 365.25 days, which differs by about eleven minutes from the true  length of the tropical year, a difference so small that for ordinary  purposes no better approximation to the true length of the year need be  desired. But _any_ deviation from the true length, however small, must  in the course of time shift the seasons, the vernal and autumnal  equinox, to another part of the year, and the ecclesiastical authorities  of mediæval Europe found here ground for objection to Cæsar's calendar,  since the great Church festival of Easter has its date determined with  reference to the vernal equinox, and with the lapse of centuries Easter  became more and more displaced in the calendar, until Pope Gregory XIII,  late in the sixteenth century, decreed another reformation, whereby ten  days were dropped from the calendar, the day after March 11th being  called March 21st, to bring back the vernal equinox to the date on which  it fell in A. D. 325, the time of the Council of Nicæa, which Gregory  adopted as the fundamental epoch of his calendar.    The calendar having thus been brought back into agreement with that of  old time, Gregory purposed to keep it in such agreement for the future  by modifying Cæsar's leap-year rule so that it should run: Every year  whose number is divisible by 4 shall be a leap year except those years  whose numbers are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. These  latter years--e. g., 1900--are counted as common years. The calendar  thus altered is called Gregorian to distinguish it from the older,  Julian calendar, and it found speedy acceptance in those civilized  countries whose Church adhered to Rome; but the Protestant powers were  slow to adopt it, and it was introduced into England and her American  colonies by act of Parliament in the year 1752, nearly two centuries  after Gregory's time. In Russia the Julian calendar has remained in  common use to our own day, but in commercial affairs it is there  customary to write the date according to both calendars--e. g., July  4/16, and at the present time strenuous exertions are making in that  country for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar to the complete  exclusion of the Julian one.    The Julian and Gregorian calendars are frequently represented by the  abbreviations O. S. and N. S., old style, new style, and as the older  historical dates are usually expressed in O. S., it is sometimes  convenient to transform a date from the one calendar to the other. This  is readily done by the formula        G = J + (N - 2) - N/4,    where _G_ and _J_ are the respective dates, _N_ is the number of the  century, and the remainder is to be neglected in the division by 4. For  September 3, 1752, O. S., we have            J = Sept. 3      N - 2 = + 15      - N/4 = -  4      ------------------          G = Sept. 14    and September 14 is the date fixed by act of Parliament to correspond to  September 3, 1752, O. S. Columbus discovered America on October 12,  1492, O. S. What is the corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar?    62. THE DAY OF THE WEEK.--A problem similar to the above but more  complicated consists in finding the day of the week on which any given  date of the Gregorian calendar falls--e. g., October 21, 1492.    The formula for this case is        7q + r = Y + D + (Y - 1)/4 - (Y - 1)/100 + (Y - 1)/400    where _Y_ denotes the given year, _D_ the number of the day (date) in  that year, and _q_ and _r_ are respectively the quotient and the  remainder obtained by dividing the second member of the equation by 7.  If _r_ = 1 the date falls on Sunday, etc., and if _r_ = 0 the day is  Saturday. For the example suggested above we have          Jan.  31        Feb.  29        Mch.  31        April 30        May   31        June  30        July  31        Aug.  31        Sept. 30        Oct.  21             ---         D = 295                      Y =  1492                  + D = + 295      + (Y - 1) ÷   4 = + 372      - (Y - 1) ÷ 100 = -  14      + (Y - 1) ÷ 400 = +   3                       -------                      7) 2148                      _q_ =   306                    _r_ =     6 = Friday.    Find from some history the day of the week on which Columbus first saw  America, and compare this with the above.    On what day of the week did last Christmas fall? On what day of the week  were you born? In the formula for the day of the week why does _q_ have  the coefficient 7? What principles in the calendar give rise to the  divisors 4, 100, 400?    For much curious and interesting information about methods of reckoning  the lapse of time the student may consult the articles Calendar and  Chronology in any good encyclopædia.    [Illustration: THE YERKES OBSERVATORY, WILLIAMS BAY, WIS.]          CHAPTER VII    ECLIPSES      63. THE NATURE OF ECLIPSES.--Every planet has a shadow which travels  with the planet along its orbit, always pointing directly away from the  sun, and cutting off from a certain region of space the sunlight which  otherwise would fill it. For the most part these shadows are invisible,  but occasionally one of them falls upon a planet or some other body  which shines by reflected sunlight, and, cutting off its supply of  light, produces the striking phenomenon which we call an eclipse. The  satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars are eclipsed whenever they  plunge into the shadows cast by their respective planets, and Jupiter  himself is partially eclipsed when one of his own satellites passes  between him and the sun, and casts upon his broad surface a shadow too  small to cover more than a fraction of it.    But the eclipses of most interest to us are those of the sun and moon,  called respectively solar and lunar eclipses. In Fig. 33 the full moon,  _M´_, is shown immersed in the shadow cast by the earth, and therefore  eclipsed, and in the same figure the new moon, _M_, is shown as casting  its shadow upon the earth and producing an eclipse of the sun. From a  mere inspection of the figure we may learn that an eclipse of the sun  can occur only at new moon--i. e., when the moon is on line between the  earth and sun--and an eclipse of the moon can occur only at full moon.  Why? Also, the eclipsed moon, _M´_, will present substantially the same  appearance from every part of the earth where it is at all visible--the  same from North America as from South America--but the eclipsed sun  will present very different aspects from different parts of the earth.  Thus, at _L_, within the moon's shadow, the sunlight will be entirely  cut off, producing what is called a total eclipse. At points of the  earth's surface near _J_ and _K_ there will be no interference whatever  with the sunlight, and no eclipse, since the moon is quite off the line  joining these regions to any part of the sun. At places between _J_ and  _L_ or _K_ and _L_ the moon will cut off a part of the sun's light, but  not all of it, and will produce what is called a partial eclipse, which,  as seen from the northern parts of the earth, will be an eclipse of the  lower (southern) part of the sun, and as seen from the southern  hemisphere will be an eclipse of the northern part of the sun.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Different kinds of eclipse.]    The moon revolves around the earth in a plane, which, in the figure, we  suppose to be perpendicular to the surface of the paper, and to pass  through the sun along the line _M´ M_ produced. But it frequently  happens that this plane is turned to one side of the sun, along some  such line as _P Q_, and in this case the full moon would cut through the  "]]]
