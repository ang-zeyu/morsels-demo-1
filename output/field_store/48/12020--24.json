[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#18)"],[1,"English type,  was the inscription--      Rev. KENNETH McDOLAN.    Underneath was scribbled in pencil: \"On a brief visit.\" Sanders sniffed  impatiently, for \"reverend\" meant \"missionary,\" and \"missionary\" might  mean anything. He looked at the card again and frowned in his  perplexity. Somehow the old English and the reverendness of the visiting  card did not go well with the rounded corners and the gilt edge.    \"Where is he?\" he demanded.    \"Master,\" said Abiboo, \"he is on the verandah. Shall I kick him off?\"  Abiboo said this very naturally and with simple directness, and Sanders  stared at him.    \"Son of sin!\" he said sternly, \"is it thus you speak of God-men, and of  white men at that?\"    \"This man wears the clothes of a God-man,\" said Abiboo serenely; \"but he  is a black man, therefore of no consequence.\"    Sanders pulled a pair of mosquito boots over his pyjamas and swore to  himself.    \"White missionaries, yes,\" he said wrathfully, \"but black missionaries I  will not endure.\"    The Reverend Kenneth was sitting in Sanders' basket-chair, one leg flung  negligently over one side of the chair to display a silk sock. His  finger-tips were touching, and he was gazing with good-natured tolerance  at the little green garden which was the Commissioner's special delight.    He was black, very black; but his manners were easy, and his bearing  self-possessed.    He nodded smilingly to Sanders and extended a lazy hand.    \"Ah, Mr. Commissioner,\" he said in faultless English, \"I have heard a  great deal about you.\"    \"Get out of that chair,\" said Sanders, who had no small talk worth  mentioning, \"and stand up when I come out to you! What do you want?\"    The Reverend Kenneth rose quickly, and accepted the situation with a  rapidity which will be incomprehensible to any who do not know how  thumbnail deep is the cultivation of the cultured savage.    \"I am on a brief visit,\" he said, a note of deference in his tone. \"I am  taking the small towns and villages along the coast, holding services,  and I desire permission to speak to your people.\"    This was not the speech he had prepared. He had come straight from  England, where he had been something of a lion in Bayswater society, and  where, too, his theological attainments had won him regard and no small  amount of fame in even a wider circle.    \"You may speak to my people,\" said Sanders; \"but you may not address the  Kano folk nor the Houssas, because they are petrified in the faith of  the Prophet.\"    Regaining his self-possession, the missionary smiled.    \"To bring light into dark places----\" he began.    \"Cut it out,\" said Sanders briefly; \"the palaver is finished.\" He turned  on his heel and re-entered the bungalow.    Then a thought struck him.    \"Hi!\" he shouted, and the retiring missionary turned back.    \"Where did you pick up the 'Kenneth McDolan'?\" he asked.    The negro smiled again.    \"It is the patronymic bestowed upon me at Sierra Leone by a good  Christian white man, who brought me up and educated me as though I were  his own son,\" he recited.    Sanders showed his teeth.    \"I have heard of such cases,\" he said unpleasantly.    The next day the missionary announced his intention of proceeding up  country. He came in to see Sanders as though nothing had happened.  Perhaps he expected to find the Commissioner a little ashamed of  himself; but if this was so he was disappointed, for Sanders was  blatantly unrepentant.    \"You've got a letter from the Administration,\" he said, \"so I can't stop  you.\"    \"There is work for me,\" said the missionary, \"work of succour and  relief. In India some four hundred thousand----\"    \"This is not India,\" said Sanders shortly; and with no other word the  native preacher went his way.    Those who know the Akasava people best know them for their  laziness--save in matter of vendetta, or in the settlement of such blood  feuds as come their way, or in the lifting of each other's goats, in all  which matters they display an energy and an agility truly inexplicable.  \"He is an Akasava man--he points with his foot,\" is a proverb of the  Upper River, and the origin of the saying goes back to a misty time when  (as the legend goes) a stranger happened upon a man of the tribe lying  in the forest.    \"Friend,\" said the stranger, \"I am lost. Show me the way to the river\";  and the Akasava warrior, raising a leg from the ground, pointed with his  toe to the path.    Though this legend lacks something in point of humour, it is regarded as  the acme of mirth-provoking stories from Bama to the Lado country.    It was six months after the Reverend Kenneth McDolan had left for his  station that there came to Sanders at his headquarters a woeful  deputation, arriving in two canoes in the middle of the night, and  awaiting him when he came from his bath to the broad stoep of his house  in the morning--a semi-circle of chastened and gloomy men, who squatted  on the wooden stoep, regarding him with the utmost misery.    \"Lord, we are of the Akasava people,\" said the spokesman, \"and we have  come a long journey.\"    \"So I am aware,\" said Sanders, with acrid dryness, \"unless the Akasava  country has shifted its position in the night. What do you seek?\"    \"Master, we are starving,\" said the speaker, \"for our crops have failed,  and there is no fish in the river; therefore we have come to you, who  are our father.\"    Now this was a most unusual request; for the Central African native does  not easily starve, and, moreover, there had come no news of crop failure  from the Upper River.    \"All this sounds like a lie,\" said Sanders thoughtfully, \"for how may a  crop fail in the Akasava country, yet be more than sufficient in Isisi?  Moreover, fish do not leave their playground without cause, and if they  do they may be followed.\"    The spokesman shifted uneasily.    \"Master, we have had much sickness,\" he said, \"and whilst we cared for  one another the planting season had passed; and, as for the fish, our  young men were too full of sorrow for their dead to go long journeys.\"  Sanders stared.    \"Therefore we have come from our chief asking you to save us, for we are  starving.\"    The man spoke with some confidence, and this was the most surprising  thing of all. Sanders was nonplussed, frankly confounded. For all the  eccentric course his daily life took, there was a certain regularity  even in its irregularity. But here was a new and unfamiliar situation.  Such things mean trouble, and he was about to probe this matter to its  depth.    \"I have nothing to give you,\" he said, \"save this advice--that you  return swiftly to where you came from and carry my word to your chief.  Later I will come and make inquiries.\"    The men were not satisfied, and an elder, wrinkled with age, and  sooty-grey of head, spoke up.    \"It is said, master,\" he mumbled, through his toothless jaws, \"that in  other lands when men starve there come many white men bringing grain and  comfort.\"    \"Eh?\"    Sanders' eyes narrowed.    \"Wait,\" he said, and walked quickly through the open door of his  bungalow.    When he came out he carried a pliant whip of rhinoceros-hide, and the  deputation, losing its serenity, fled precipitately.    Sanders watched the two canoes paddling frantically up stream, and the  smile was without any considerable sign of amusement. That same night  the _Zaire_ left for the Akasava country, carrying a letter to the  Reverend Kenneth McDolan, which was brief, but unmistakable in its  tenor.        \"Dear Sir,\"--it ran--\"You will accompany the bearer to      headquarters, together with your belongings. In the event of      your refusing to comply with this request, I have instructed my      sergeant to arrest you. Yours faithfully,          \"H. Sanders, _Commissioner_.\"    \"And the reason I am sending you out of this country,\" said Sanders, \"is  because you have put funny ideas into the heads of my people.\"    \"I assure you----\" began the negro.    \"I don't want your assurance,\" said Sanders, \"you are not going to work  an Indian Famine Fund in Central Africa.\"    \"The people were starving----\"    Sanders smiled.    \"I have sent word to them that I am coming to Akasava,\" he said grimly,  \"and that I will take the first starved-looking man I see and beat him  till he is sore.\"    The next day the missionary went, to the intense relief, be it said, of  the many white missionaries scattered up and down the river; for,  strange as it may appear, a negro preacher who wears a black coat and  silk socks is regarded with a certain amount of suspicion.    True to his promise, Sanders made his visit, but found none to thrash,  for he came to a singularly well-fed community that had spent a whole  week in digging out of the secret hiding-places the foodstuffs which, at  the suggestion of a too zealous seeker after fame, it had concealed.    \"Here,\" said Sanders, wickedly, \"endeth the first lesson.\"    But he was far from happy. It is a remarkable fact that once you  interfere with the smooth current of native life all manner of things  happen. It cannot be truthfully said that the events that followed on  the retirement from active life of the Reverend Kenneth McDolan were  immediately traceable to his ingenious attempt to engineer a famine in  Akasava. But he had sown a seed, the seed of an idea that somebody was  responsible for their well-being--he had set up a beautiful idol of  Pauperism, a new and wonderful fetish. In the short time of his stay he  had instilled into the heathen mind the dim, vague, and elusive idea of  the Brotherhood of Man.    This Sanders discovered, when, returning from his visit of inspection,  he met, drifting with the stream, a canoe in which lay a prone man,  lazily setting his course with half-hearted paddle strokes.    Sanders, on the bridge of his tiny steamer, pulled the little string  that controlled the steam whistle, for the canoe lay in his track.  Despite the warning, the man in the canoe made no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#18)"],[1,"the records into his hands.    These records were engraved on plates which had the appearance of  gold. Each plate was not far from seven inches in width by eight  inches in length, being not quite as thick as common tin. They were  filled on both sides with engravings, in Egyptian characters, and  bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, and fastened at  one edge with three rings running through the whole. This volume was  something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed.  The characters of letters upon the unsealed part were small, and  beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity  in its construction, as well as much skill in the art of engraving.  With the records was found a curious instrument, called by the  ancients the Urim and Thummim, which consisted of two transparent  stones, clear as crystal, set in the two rims of a bow. This was in  use in ancient times by persons called Seers. It was an instrument by  the use of which they received revelation of things distant, or of  things past or future.    In the mean time the inhabitants of that vicinity, having been  informed that Mr. Smith had seen heavenly visions, and that he had  discovered sacred records, began to ridicule and mock at those things.  And after having obtained those sacred things, while proceeding home  through the wilderness and fields, he was waylaid by two ruffians, who  had secreted themselves for the purpose of robbing him of the records.  One of them struck him with a club before he perceived them; but being  a strong man, and large in stature, with great exertion he cleared  himself from them, and ran towards home, being closely pursued until  he came near his father's house, when his pursuers, for fear of being  detected, turned and fled the other way.    Soon the news of his discoveries spread abroad throughout all those  parts. False reports, misrepresentations, and base slanders flew as if  upon the wings of the wind in every direction. The house was  frequently beset by mobs and evil designing persons. Several times he  was shot at, and very narrowly escaped. Every device was used to get  the plates away from him. And being continually in danger of his life,  from a gang of abandoned wretches, he at length concluded to leave the  place, and go to Pennsylvania; and accordingly packed up his goods,  putting the plates into a barrel of beans, and proceeded upon his  journey. He had not gone far, before he was overtaken by an officer  with a search warrant, who flattered himself with the idea that he  should surely obtain the plates; after searching very diligently, ho  was sadly disappointed at not finding them. Mr. Smith then drove on;  but before he got to his journey's end, he was again overtaken by an  officer on the same business, and after ransacking the wagon very  carefully, he went his way, as much chagrined as the first at not  being able to discover the object of his research. Without any further  molestation, he pursued his journey until he came into the northern  part of Pennsylvania, near the Susquehanna River, in which part his  father-in-law resided.    Having provided himself with a home, ho commenced translating the  record, by the gift and power of God, through the means of the Urim  and Thummim; and being a poor writer, he was under the necessity of  employing a scribe, to write the translation as it tame from his  mouth.    In the meantime, a few of the original characters were accurately  transcribed and translated by Mr. Smith, which, with the translation,  were taken by a gentleman named Martin Harris to the city of New York,  where they were presented to a learned gentleman named Anthon, who  professed to be extensively acquainted with many languages, both  ancient and modern. He examined them, but was unable to decipher them  correctly; but he presumed, that if the original records could be  brought, he could assist in translating them.    But to return. Mr. Smith continued the work of translation, as his  pecuniary circumstances would permit, until he had finished the  unsealed part of the records. The part translated is entitled the  \"Book of Mormon,\" which contains nearly as much reading as the Old  Testament.    \"Well,\" says the objector, \"if it were not for the marvellous, the  book would be considered one of the greatest discoveries the world  ever witnessed. If you had been ploughing, or digging a well or cellar  and accidentally dug up a record containing some account of the  ancient history of the American continent, and of its original  inhabitants, together with the origin of the Indian tribes who now  inhabit it; had this record had nothing to do with God, or angels, or  inspiration, it would have been hailed by all the learned of America  and Europe, as one of the greatest and most important discoveries of  modern times, unfolding a mystery which had, until then, bid defiance  to all the researches of the learned world. Every newspaper would have  been filled with the glad tidings, while its contents would have  poured upon the world a flood of light, on subjects before concealed  in the labyrinth of uncertainty and doubt. But who can stoop, and so  humble himself as to receive anything, in this enlightened age,  renowned for its religion and learning, from the ministering of  angels, and from inspiration? This is too much: away with such things,  it comes in contact with the wisdom and popularity of the day.\" To  this I reply, The Lord knew that before He revealed it; this was one  principal object He had in view; it is just the manner of His dealing  with the children of men; He always takes a different course from the  one marked out for Him by the wisdom of the world, in order to  \"confound the wise, and bring to naught the understanding of the  prudent;\" He chooses men of low degree, even the simple and the  unlearned, and those who are despised, to do His work and to bring  about His purposes, that no flesh shall glory in His presence. O ye  wise, and ye learned, who despise the wisdom that comes from above!  Know ye not, that it was impossible for the world by wisdom to find  out God? Know ye not that all your wisdom is foolishness with God?  Know ye not that ye must become as a little child, and be willing to  learn wisdom, from the least of His servants, or you will perish in  your ignorance?    But what are the evidences which we gather from Scripture, concerning  the coming forth of this glorious work? We shall attempt to prove:  first, that America is a land promised to the seed of Joseph; second,  that the Lord would reveal to them His truth as well as to the Jews;  and third, that their record should come forth, and unite its  testimony, with the record of the Jews, in time for the restoration of  Israel, in the last days.    First, Genesis, xlviii, Jacob, while blessing the two sons of Joseph,  says: \"Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\" In  the same blessing, it is said of Ephraim, \"His seed shall become a  multitude of nations.\" Now put the sense of these sayings together,  and it makes Ephraim a multitude of nations in the midst of the earth.  In Genesis, xlix, it is prophesied concerning Joseph, while Jacob was  blessing him, that he should be \"a fruitful bough by a well, whose  branches run over the wall: the archers have sorely grieved him, and  shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode in strength.\" Again, he  further says: \"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the  blessings of my progenitors, unto the utmost bound of the everlasting  hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the  head of him that was separate from his brethren.\" Now I ask, Who were  Jacob's progenitors, and what was the blessing conferred upon him?  Abraham and Isaac were his progenitors, and the land of Canaan was the  blessing they conferred upon him, or that God promised them he should  possess. Recollect that Jacob confers on Joseph a much greater land  than that of Canaan; even greater than his fathers had conferred upon  him, for Joseph's blessing was to extend to the uttermost bound of the  everlasting hills. Now, reader, stand in Egypt, where Jacob then  stood, and measure to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills, and  you will land somewhere in the central part of America. Again, one of  the Prophets says, in speaking of Ephraim: \"When the Lord shall roar,  the children of Ephraim shall tremble from the west.\" Now let us sum  up these sayings, and what have we gained? First, that Ephraim was to  grow into a multitude of nations in the midst of the earth; second,  Joseph was to be greatly blessed in a large inheritance, as far off as  America; third, this was to be on the west of Egypt or Jerusalem.    Now let the world search from pole to pole, and they will not find a  multitude of nations in the midst of the earth, who can possibly have  sprung from Ephraim, unless they find them in America; for the midst  of all other parts of the earth is inhabited by mixed races, who have  sprung from various sources; while here an almost boundless country  was secluded from the rest of the world, and inhabited by a race of  men, evidently of the same origin, although as evidently divided into  many nations. Now, the Scriptures cannot be broken; therefore, these  Scriptures must apply to America, for the plainest of reasons: they  can apply to no other place.    Now, secondly, we are to prove that God revealed himself to the seed  of Joseph or Ephraim--their location we have already proved--dwelling  in America. For this, we quote Hosea, viii, 12; speaking of Ephraim,  he says by the spirit of prophecy: \"I have written to him the great  things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.\" This is  proof positive and needs no comment, that the great truths of Heaven  were revealed unto Ephraim, and were counted as a strange thing.
