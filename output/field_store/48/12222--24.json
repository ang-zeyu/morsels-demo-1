This sensation was so much the more  agreeable, as we found the air of Santa Cruz very oppressive. As  our organs are more affected by disagreeable impressions, the  change of temperature becomes still more sensible when we return  from Laguna to the port: we seem then to be drawing near the mouth  of a furnace. The same impression is felt, when, on the coast of  Caracas, we descend from the mountain of Avila to the port of La  Guayra. According to the law of the decrement of heat, three  hundred and fifty toises in height produce in this latitude only  three or four degrees difference in temperature. The heat which  overpowers the traveller on his entrance into Santa Cruz, or La  Guayra, must consequently be attributed to the reverberation from  the rocks, against which these towns are built.    The perpetual coolness which prevails at Laguna causes it to be  considered in the Canaries a delightful abode. Situated in a small  plain, surrounded by gardens, protected by a hill which is crowned  by a wood of laurels, myrtle, and arbutus, the capital of Teneriffe  is very beautifully placed. We should be mistaken if, relying on  the account of some travellers, we believed it seated on the border  of a lake. The rain sometimes forms a sheet of water of  considerable extent; and the geologist, who beholds in everything  the past rather than the present state of nature, can have no doubt  but that the whole plain is a great basin dried up. Laguna has  fallen from its opulence, since the lateral eruptions of the  volcano have destroyed the port of Garachico, and since Santa Cruz  has become the central point of the commerce of the island. It  contains only 9000 inhabitants, of whom nearly 400 are monks,  distributed in six convents. The town is surrounded with a great  number of windmills, which indicate the cultivation of wheat in  these high countries. I shall observe on this occasion, that  different kinds of grain were known to the Guanches. They called  wheat at Teneriffe tano, at Lancerota triffa; barley, in the grand  Canary, bore the name of aramotanoque, and at Lancerota it was  called tamosen. The flour of roasted barley (gofio) and goat's-milk  constituted the principal food of the people, on the origin of  which so many systematic fables have been current. These aliments  sufficiently prove that the race of the Guanches belonged to the  nations of the old continent, perhaps to those of Caucasus, and not  like the rest of the Atlantides,* to the inhabitants of the New  World (* Without entering here into any discussion respecting the  existence of the Atlantis, I may cite the opinion of Diodorus  Siculus, according to whom the Atlantides were ignorant of the use  of corn, because they were separated from the rest of mankind  before these gramina were cultivated.); these, before the arrival  of the Europeans, were unacquainted with corn, milk, and cheese.    A great number of chapels, which the Spaniards call ermitas,  encircle the town of Laguna. Shaded by trees of perpetual verdure,  and erected on small eminences, these chapels add to the  picturesque effect of the landscape. The interior of the town is  not equal to its external appearance. The houses are solidly built,  but very antique, and the streets seem deserted. A botanist ought  not to complain of the antiquity of the edifices. The roofs and  walls are covered with Canary house-leek and those elegant  trichomanes, mentioned by every traveller. These plants are  nourished by the abundant mists.    Mr. Anderson, the naturalist in the third voyage of captain Cook,  advises physicians to send their patients to Teneriffe, on account  of the mildness of the temperature and the equal climate of the  Canaries. The ground on these islands rises in an amphitheatre, and  presents simultaneously, as in Peru and Mexico, the temperature of  every climate, from the heat of Africa to the cold of the higher  Alps. Santa Cruz, the port of Orotava, the town of the same name,  and that of Laguna, are four places, the mean temperatures of which  form a descending series. In the south of Europe the change of the  seasons is too sensibly felt to present the same advantages.  Teneriffe, on the contrary, situated as it were on the threshold of  the tropics, though but a few days' sail from Spain, shares in the  charms which nature has lavished on the equinoctial regions.  Vegetation here displays some of her fairest and most majestic  forms in the banana and the palm-tree. He who is alive to the  charms of nature finds in this delicious island remedies still more  potent than the climate. No abode appeared to me more fitted to  dissipate melancholy, and restore peace to the perturbed mind, than  that of Teneriffe or Madeira. These advantages are the effect not  of the beauty of the site and the purity of the air alone: the  moral feeling is no longer harrowed up by the sight of slavery, the  presence of which is so revolting in the West Indies, and in every  other place to which European colonists have conveyed what they  call their civilization and their industry.    In winter the climate of Laguna is extremely foggy, and the  inhabitants often complain of the cold. A fall of snow, however,  has never been seen; a fact which may seem to indicate that the  mean temperature of this town must be above 18.7 degrees (15  degrees R.), that is to say, higher than that of Naples. I do not  lay this down as an unexceptional conclusion, for in winter the  refrigeration of the clouds does not depend so much on the mean  temperature of the whole year, as on the instantaneous diminution  of heat to which a district is exposed by its local situation. The  mean temperature of the capital of Mexico, for instance, is only  16.8 degrees (13.5 degrees R.), nevertheless, in the space of a  hundred years snow has fallen only once, while in the south of  Europe and in Africa it snows in places where the mean temperature  is above 19 degrees.    The vicinity of the sea renders the climate of Laguna more mild in  winter than might be expected, arising from its elevation above the  level of the ocean. I was astonished to learn that M. Broussonnet  had planted in the midst of this town, in the garden of the Marquis  de Nava, the bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus incisa), and  cinnamon-tree (Laurus Cinnamomum). These valuable productions of  the South Sea and the East Indies are naturalized there as well as  at Orotava. Does not this fact prove that the bread-fruit might  flourish in Calabria, Sicily, and Granada? The culture of the  coffee-tree has not equally succeeded at Laguna, though its fruit  ripens at Teguesta, as well as between the port of Orotava and the  village of St. Juan de la Rambla. It is probable that some local  circumstances, perhaps the nature of the soil and the winds that  prevail in the flowering season, are the cause of this phenomenon.  In other regions, in the neighbourhood of Naples, for instance, the  coffee-tree thrives abundantly, though the mean temperature  scarcely rises above 18 centigrade degrees.    No person has ascertained in the island of Teneriffe, the lowest  height at which snow falls every year. This fact, though easy of  verification by barometrical measurements, has hitherto been  generally neglected under every zone. It is nevertheless highly  interesting both to agriculture in the colonies and meteorology,  and fully as important as the measure of the limit of the perpetual  snows. My observations furnished me with the data, set down in the  following table:--    Column 1: North latitude.    Column 2: Lowest height in toises at which snow falls.    Column 3: Lowest height in metres at which snow falls.    Column 4: Inferior limit in toises of the perpetual snows.    Column 5: Inferior limit in metres of the perpetual snows.    Column 6: Difference in toises of columns 4 and 5.    Column 7: Difference in metres of columns 4 and 5.    Column 8: Mean temperature degrees centigrade.    Column 9: Mean temperature degrees Reaum.      0  : 2040 : 3976 : 2460 : 4794 :  420 :  818 : 27   : 21.6.      20 : 1550 : 3020 : 2360 : 4598 :  810 : 1578 : 24.5 : 19.6.      40 :    0 :    0 : 1540 : 3001 : 1540 : 3001 : 17   : 13.6.    This table presents only the ordinary state of nature, that is to  say, the phenomena as they are annually observed. Exceptions  founded on particular local circumstances, exist. Thus it sometimes  snows, though seldom, at Naples, at Lisbon, and even at Malaga,  consequently as low as the 37th degree of latitude: and, as we have  just observed, snow has been seen to fall at Mexico, the elevation  of which is 1173 toises above the level of the ocean. This  phenomenon, which had not been seen for several centuries, took  place on the day that the Jesuits were expelled, and was attributed  by the people to that act of severity. A more striking exception  was found in the climate of Valladolid, the capital of the province  of Mechoacan. According to my measures, the height of this town,  situate in latitude 19 degrees 42 minutes, is only a thousand  toises: and yet, a few years before our arrival in New Spain, the  streets were covered with snow for some hours.    Snow had been seen to fall also at Teneriffe, in a place lying  above Esperanza de la Laguna, very near the town of that name, in  the gardens of which the artocarpus flourishes. This extraordinary  fact was confirmed to M. Broussonnet by very aged persons. The  Erica arborea, the Myrica Faya, and the Arbutus callicarpa,* (*  This fine arbutus, imported by M. Broussonnet, is very different  from the Arbutus laurifolia, with which it has been confounded, but  which belongs to North America.) did not suffer from the snow; but  it destroyed all the vines in the open air. This observation is  interesting to vegetable physiology. In hot countries, the plants  are so vigorous, that cold is less injurious to them, provided it  be of short duration. I have seen the banana cultivated in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6340"],[0,"Literary Lapses (#18)"],[1,"and appeals  to the source of his inspiration; his humanity prompts  him to extend the inspiration to Policeman Hogan. The  minion of the law walks his beat with a feeling of more  than tranquillity. A solitary Chinaman, returning home  late from his midnight laundry, scuttles past. The literary  instinct has risen strong in Hogan from his connection  with the man of genius above him, and the passage of the  lone Chinee gives him occasion to write in his book:    \"Four-thirty. Everything is simply great. There are four  lights in Mr. Scalper's room. Mild, balmy weather with  prospects of an earthquake, which may be held in check  by walking with extreme caution. Two Chinamen have just  passed--mandarins, I presume. Their walk was unsteady,  but their faces so benign as to disarm suspicion.\"    Up in the office Mr. Scalper has reached the letter of  a correspondent which appears to give him particular  pleasure, for he delineates the character with a beaming  smile of satisfaction. To the unpractised eye the writing  resembles the prim, angular hand of an elderly spinster.  Mr. Scalper, however, seems to think otherwise, for he  writes:    \"Aunt Dorothea. You have a merry, rollicking nature. At  times you are seized with a wild, tumultuous hilarity to  which you give ample vent in shouting and song. You are  much addicted to profanity, and you rightly feel that  this is part of your nature and you must not check it.  The world is a very bright place to you, Aunt Dorothea.  Write to me again soon. Our minds seem cast in the same  mould.\"    Mr. Scalper seems to think that he has not done full  justice to the subject he is treating, for he proceeds  to write a long private letter to Aunt Dorothea in addition  to the printed delineation. As he finishes the City Hall  clock points to five, and Policeman Hogan makes the last  entry in his chronicle. Hogan has seated himself upon  the steps of The Eclipse building for greater comfort  and writes with a slow, leisurely fist:    \"The other hand of the clock points north and the second  longest points south-east by south. I infer that it is  five o'clock. The electric lights in Mr. Scalper's room  defy the eye. The roundsman has passed and examined my  notes of the night's occurrences. They are entirely  satisfactory, and he is pleased with their literary form.  The earthquake which I apprehended was reduced to a few  minor oscillations which cannot reach me where I sit--\"    The lowering of the bottle interrupts Policeman Hogan.  The long letter to Aunt Dorothea has cooled the ardour  of Mr. Scalper. The generous blush has passed from his  mind and he has been trying in vain to restore it. To  afford Hogan a similar opportunity, he decides not to  haul the bottle up immediately, but to leave it in his  custody while he delineates a character. The writing of  this correspondent would seem to the inexperienced eye  to be that of a timid little maiden in her teens. Mr.  Scalper is not to be deceived by appearances. He shakes  his head mournfully at the letter and writes:    \"Little Emily. You have known great happiness, but it  has passed. Despondency has driven you to seek forgetfulness  in drink. Your writing shows the worst phase of the liquor  habit. I apprehend that you will shortly have delirium  tremens. Poor little Emily! Do not try to break off; it  is too late.\"    Mr. Scalper is visibly affected by his correspondent's  unhappy condition. His eye becomes moist, and he decides  to haul up the bottle while there is still time to save  Policeman Hogan from acquiring a taste for liquor. He is  surprised and alarmed to find the attempt to haul it up  ineffectual. The minion of the law has fallen into a  leaden slumber, and the bottle remains tight in his grasp.  The baffled delineator lets fall the string and returns  to finish his task. Only a few lines are now required to  fill the column, but Mr. Scalper finds on examining the  correspondence that he has exhausted the subjects. This,  however, is quite a common occurrence and occasions no  dilemma in the mind of the talented gentleman. It is his  custom in such cases to fill up the space with an imaginary  character or two, the analysis of which is a task most  congenial to his mind. He bows his head in thought for  a few moments, and then writes as follows:    \"Policeman H. Your hand shows great firmness; when once  set upon a thing you are not easily moved. But you have  a mean, grasping disposition and a tendency to want more  than your share. You have formed an attachment which you  hope will be continued throughout life, but your selfishness  threatens to sever the bond.\"    Having written which, Mr. Scalper arranges his manuscript  for the printer next day, dons his hat and coat, and  wends his way home in the morning twilight, feeling that  his pay is earned.          The Passing of the Poet    Studies in what may be termed collective psychology are  essentially in keeping with the spirit of the present  century. The examination of the mental tendencies, the  intellectual habits which we display not as individuals,  but as members of a race, community, or crowd, is offering  a fruitful field of speculation as yet but little exploited.  One may, therefore, not without profit, pass in review  the relation of the poetic instinct to the intellectual  development of the present era.    Not the least noticeable feature in the psychological  evolution of our time is the rapid disappearance of  poetry. The art of writing poetry, or perhaps more fairly,  the habit of writing poetry, is passing from us. The poet  is destined to become extinct.    To a reader of trained intellect the initial difficulty  at once suggests itself as to what is meant by poetry.  But it is needless to quibble at a definition of the  term. It may be designated, simply and fairly, as the  art of expressing a simple truth in a concealed form of  words, any number of which, at intervals greater or less,  may or may not rhyme.    The poet, it must be said, is as old as civilization.  The Greeks had him with them, stamping out his iambics  with the sole of his foot. The Romans, too, knew  him--endlessly juggling his syllables together, long and  short, short and long, to make hexameters. This can now  be done by electricity, but the Romans did not know it.    But it is not my present purpose to speak of the poets  of an earlier and ruder time. For the subject before us  it is enough to set our age in comparison with the era  that preceded it. We have but to contrast ourselves with  our early Victorian grandfathers to realize the profound  revolution that has taken place in public feeling. It is  only with an effort that the practical common sense of  the twentieth century can realize the excessive  sentimentality of the earlier generation.    In those days poetry stood in high and universal esteem.  Parents read poetry to their children. Children recited  poetry to their parents. And he was a dullard, indeed,  who did not at least profess, in his hours of idleness,  to pour spontaneous rhythm from his flowing quill.    Should one gather statistics of the enormous production  of poetry some sixty or seventy years ago, they would  scarcely appear credible. Journals and magazines teemed  with it. Editors openly countenanced it. Even the daily  press affected it. Love sighed in home-made stanzas.  Patriotism rhapsodized on the hustings, or cited rolling  hexameters to an enraptured legislature. Even melancholy  death courted his everlasting sleep in elegant elegiacs.    In that era, indeed, I know not how, polite society was  haunted by the obstinate fiction that it was the duty of  a man of parts to express himself from time to time in  verse. Any special occasion of expansion or exuberance,  of depression, torsion, or introspection, was sufficient  to call it forth. So we have poems of dejection, of  reflection, of deglutition, of indigestion.    Any particular psychological disturbance was enough to  provoke an excess of poetry. The character and manner of  the verse might vary with the predisposing cause. A  gentleman who had dined too freely might disexpand himself  in a short fit of lyric doggerel in which \"bowl\" and  \"soul\" were freely rhymed. The morning's indigestion  inspired a long-drawn elegiac, with \"bier\" and \"tear,\"  \"mortal\" and \"portal\" linked in sonorous sadness. The  man of politics, from time to time, grateful to an  appreciative country, sang back to it, \"Ho, Albion, rising  from the brine!\" in verse whose intention at least was  meritorious.    And yet it was but a fiction, a purely fictitious  obligation, self-imposed by a sentimental society. In  plain truth, poetry came no more easily or naturally to  the early Victorian than to you or me. The lover twanged  his obdurate harp in vain for hours for the rhymes that  would not come, and the man of politics hammered at his  heavy hexameter long indeed before his Albion was finally  \"hoed\" into shape; while the beer-besotted convivialist  cudgelled his poor wits cold sober in rhyming the light  little bottle-ditty that should have sprung like Aphrodite  from the froth of the champagne.    I have before me a pathetic witness of this fact. It is  the note-book once used for the random jottings of a  gentleman of the period. In it I read: \"Fair Lydia, if  my earthly harp.\" This is crossed out, and below it  appears, \"Fair Lydia, COULD my earthly harp.\" This again  is erased, and under it appears, \"Fair Lydia, SHOULD my  earthly harp.\" This again is struck out with a despairing  stroke, and amended to read: \"Fair Lydia, DID my earthly  harp.\" So that finally, when the lines appeared in the  Gentleman's Magazine (1845) in their ultimate shape--\"Fair  Edith, when with fluent pen,\" etc., etc.--one can realize  from what a desperate congelation the fluent pen had been  so perseveringly rescued.    There can be little doubt of the deleterious effect  occasioned both to public and"]]]
