He is inspired with derision that is expressed in every tone and  gesture. His agile form is vibrant with it when he flattens himself  against a tree-trunk, toes and tail quivering with intensity of ridicule  as fully expressed in every motion as in his nasal snicker and throaty  chuckle or in the chattering jeer that he pours down when he has  attained a midway or topmost bough and cocks his tail with a saucy curve  above his arched back.    When he persistently retires within his wooden tower, he still peers out  saucily from his lofty portal, and if he disappears you may yet hear the  smothered chuckle wherewith he continues to tickle his ribs. When in a  less scornful mood, he is at least supremely indifferent, deigning to  regard you with but the corner of an eye, while he rasps a nut or chips  a cone.    Ordinarily you must be philosophical or godly to suffer gibes with  equanimity, but you need be neither to endure the scoffs of this buffoon  of the woods and waysides. They only amuse you as they do him, and you  could forgive these tricks tenfold multiplied if he had no worse, and  love him if he were but half as good as he is beautiful.    He exasperates when he cuts off your half-grown apples and pears in  sheer wantonness, injuring you and profiting himself only in the  pleasure of seeing and hearing them fall. But you are heated with a  hotter wrath when he reveals his chief wickedness, and you catch sight  of him stealthily skulking along the leafy by-paths of the branches,  silently intent on evil deeds and plotting the murder of callow  innocents. Quite noiseless now, himself, his whereabouts are only  indicated by the distressful outcry of the persecuted and sympathizing  birds and the fluttering swoops of their futile attacks upon the  marauder. Then when you see him gliding away, swift and silent as a  shadow, bearing a half-naked fledgeling in his jaws, if this is the  first revelation of such wickedness, you are as painfully surprised as  if you had discovered a little child in some wanton act of cruelty.    It seems quite out of all fitness of nature that this merry fellow  should turn murderer, that this dainty connoisseur of choice nuts and  tender buds, and earliest discoverer and taster of the maple's  sweetness, should become so grossly carnivorous and savagely  bloodthirsty. But anon he will cajole you with pretty ways into  forgetfulness and forgiveness of his crimes. You find yourself offering,  in extenuation of his sins, confession of your own offenses. Have not  you, too, wrought havoc among harmless broods and brought sorrow to  feathered mothers and woodland homes? Is he worse than you, or are you  better than he? Against his sins you set his beauty and tricksy manners,  and for them would not banish him out of the world nor miss the  incomparable touch of wild life that his presence gives it.          XXXVIII    THE RUFFED GROUSE      The woods in the older parts of our country possess scarcely a trait of  the primeval forest. The oldest trees have a comparatively youthful  appearance, and are pygmies in girth beside the decaying stumps of their  giant ancestors. They are not so shagged with moss nor so scaled with  lichens. The forest floor has lost its ancient carpet of ankle-deep moss  and the intricate maze of fallen trees in every stage of decay, and  looks clean-swept and bare. The tangle of undergrowth is gone, many of  the species which composed it having quite disappeared, as have many of  the animals that flourished in the perennial shade of the old woods.    If in their season one sees and hears more birds among their lower  interlaced branches, he is not likely to catch sight or sound of many of  the denizens of the old wilderness. No startled deer bounds away before  him, nor bear shuffles awkwardly from his feast of mast at one's  approach, nor does one's flesh creep at the howl of the gathering wolves  or the panther's scream or the rustle of his stealthy footsteps.    But as you saunter on your devious way you may hear a rustle of quick  feet in the dry leaves and a sharp, insistent cry, a succession of  short, high-pitched clucks running into and again out of a querulous  \"_ker-r-r-r_,\" all expressing warning as much as alarm. Your ears guide  your eyes to the exact point from which the sounds apparently come, but  if these are not keen and well trained they fail to detach any animate  form from the inanimate dun and gray of dead leaves and underbrush.    With startling suddenness out of the monotony of lifeless color in an  eddying flurry of dead leaves, fanned to erratic flight by his  wing-beats, the ruffed grouse bursts into view, in full flight with the  first strokes of his thundering pinions, and you have a brief vision of  untamed nature as it was in the old days. On either side of the  vanishing brown nebula the ancient mossed and lichened trunks rear  themselves again, above it their lofty ramage veils the sky, beneath it  lie the deep, noiseless cushion of moss, the shrubs and plants that the  old wood rangers knew and the moose browsed on, and the tangled trunks  of fallen trees. You almost fancy that you hear the long-ago silenced  voices of the woods, so vividly does this wild spirit for an instant  conjure up a vision of the old wild world whereof he is a survival.    Acquaintance with civilized man has not tamed him, but has made him the  wilder. He deigns to feed upon apple-tree buds and buckwheat and  woodside clover, not as a gift, but a begrudged compensation for what  you have taken from him, and gives you therefor not even the thanks of  familiarity; and notwithstanding his acquaintance with generations of  your race he will not suffer you to come so near to him as he would your  grandfather.    If, when the leaves are falling, you find him in your barnyard, garden,  or out-house, or on the porch, do not think he has any intention of  associating with you or your plebeian poultry. You can only wonder where  he found refuge from the painted shower when all his world was wooded.  If he invites your attendance at his drum solo, it is only to fool you  with the sight of an empty stage, for you must be as stealthy and  keen-eyed as a lynx to see his proud display of distended ruff and wide  spread of barred tail and accelerated beat of wings that mimic thunder,  or see even the leafy curtain of his stage flutter in the wind of his  swift exit.    How the definite recognition of his motionless form evades you, so  perfectly are his colors merged into those of his environment, whether  it be in the flush greenness of summer, the painted hues of autumn or  its later faded dun and gray, or in the whiteness of winter. Among one  or the other he is but a clot of dead leaves, a knot upon a branch, the  gray stump of a sapling protruding from the snow, or, covered deep in  the unmarked whiteness, he bursts from it like a mine exploded at your  feet, leaving you agape till he has vanished from your sight and your  ears have caught the last flick of his wings against the dry branches.    In May, his mate sits on her nest, indistinguishable among the brown  leaves and gray branches about her. Later, when surprised with her  brood, how conspicuous she makes herself, fluttering and staggering  along the ground, while her callow chicks, old in cunning though so  lately their eyes first beheld the world, scatter in every direction  like a shattered globule of quicksilver and magically disappear where  there is no apparent hiding-place. Did they con the first lesson of  safety in the dark chamber of the egg, or absorb it with the warmth of  the brooding breast that gave them life?    Listen, and out of the silence which follows the noisy dispersion of the  family hear the low sibilant voice of the mother calling her children to  her or cautioning them to continued hiding. Perhaps you may see her,  alertly skulking among the underbrush, still uttering that tender,  persuasive cry, so faint that the chirp of a cricket might overbear it.  Scatter her brood when the members are half grown and almost as strong  of wing as herself, and you presently hear her softly calling them and  assuring them of her continued care.    Among many things that mark the changing season, is the dispersion of  this wildwood family. Each member is now shifting for itself in matters  of seeking food, safety, pleasure, and comfort. You will come upon one  in the ferny undergrowth of the lowland woods where he is consorting  with woodcock, frighten another from his feast on the fence-side  elderberries, scare one in the thick shadows of the evergreens, another  on the sparsely wooded steep of a rocky hillside, and later hear the  drum-beat of a young cock that the soft Indian summer has fooled into  springtime love-making, and each has the alertness that complete  self-dependence has enforced.    Still, you may come upon them gathered in social groups, yet each going  his own way when flushed. Upon rare occasions you may surprise a grand  convention of all the grouse of the region congregated on the sunny lee  of a hillside. It is a sight and sound to remember long, though for the  moment you forget the gun in your hands, when by ones, twos, and dozens  the dusky forms burst away up wind, down wind, across wind, signalling  their departure with volleys of intermittent and continuous thunder. Not  many times in your life will you see this, yet, if but once, you will be  thankful that you have not outlived all the old world's wildness.          XXXIX    TWO SHOTS      A boy of fourteen, alert, but too full of life to move slowly and  cautiously, is walking along an old road in the woods, a road that winds  here and there with meanderings that now seem vagrant and purposeless  but once led to the various piles of cordwood and logs for whose  harvesting it was hewn.

There is scarce a Canadian ranche hand but owns a       pony of bronco breed, scarce an Australian station hand of any       decent calibre but owns or can procure a tough and serviceable       semi-'brumbie' mount. And will these men volunteer? Yes, plenty       of them, and those that won't can't. Surely Empire saved or       gained is worth their worth to the Motherland they fight for.       Let her hire them. Transportation and time? The Boer war is not       over yet, and England's pocket is deep. To-day she fights for       her life, for her honour, and win she must. Arm them and saddle       them, men of the wild-lands and prairies. Work them van, flank,       and rear. This folly of 'standard' physique and 'training'--to       the winds with it. The theory of weight and height for       effective fighting is exploded. Heart, eye, and seat, and       wild-land inherent tact make up for it. Five-feet-six can ride       and shoot and fight or die as well as six-feet-two. We       wild-landers have proven it over and over again. Even when the       war is over, and our regulars and reserves must return, make       these men into protective police for a while, officered not by       orthodoxy but by knowledge and experience. They will 'learn the       country.' They will evolve scouts from amongst them who shall       make no mistakes. They will give to England what she needs in       times like these--to come again or not. Your yeomanry won't do       the trick; nor your oat-fed kharki-clad higher Colonials       either. 'Tis your Anglo-Boer, cowboy, stockrider, shearer,       rouseabout, cull, given his way and a cause--yes, he and his       scrub-fed mongrel mount and 'gun.'\"    These expressions of opinion almost amounted to a prophecy, for very  shortly the Canadian ranche hands, the Australian stockriders, the hardy  New Zealanders, and the \"higher\" Colonials--as Mr. Hall styled  them--taught us lessons which we were swift enough to follow.    At Christmas the troops fared well, and contributions of a homely and  delectable kind were supplied to make the season pleasurable. The  inhabitants of Naauwpoort showed their appreciation of Mr. Thomas Atkins  in many tangible ways, notably by providing him with appetising  refreshments as he arrived by rail. Of course, there was a run on the  telegraph office. Christmas greetings went pouring out and came pouring  in, while the mail-bags swelled with a plethora of seasonable  blandishments. At Arundel Colonel Fisher and the officers of the 10th  Hussars endeavoured to forward Christmas greetings to the Colonel of the  Regiment, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, but for some  unexplained reason the felicitation was not allowed to go beyond the  vigilant eye of the censor.    The great attraction of Christmas, and its accompaniment the New Year,  was the expectation of a gift from Queen Victoria, which was specially  prepared according to the order of the Sovereign herself. It was to take  the form of a tin of chocolate, and was to be presented to every soldier  on service in South Africa. The box was specially designed, and adorned  with the regal monogram. This unique gift, in order to make it the more  valuable as a trophy or a family relic, was manufactured only of the  exact number required for presentation to each individual serving at the  front.    Naauwpoort enlivened itself with sports, and though the weather was  almost tropical, the activity served to compensate for the absence of  the mirth of Merrie England. At this time the Boers were approaching  nearer the British camp. There was a three days' truce, it is true, but  their positions were only six miles from our troops, and they were  warned that a nearer approach would mean prompt action by the guns.    The daily routine went on somewhat monotonously--the grooming, watering,  and exercising of horses; drilling, exercising the mules of ambulance  and transport waggons; unloading the food supplies, cooking  them--occupations which afforded work in plenty, but the real business  of warfare was suspended. Some of the officers made an effort to get up  hunting parties, and succeeded in bagging a few springbuck, but their  expeditions were fraught with even more risk to themselves than to their  quarry. For instance, in one case, while two gallant Nimrods were in the  act of stalking a splendid springbuck, their chargers made off. They  suddenly found themselves almost surrounded by Boers, and an animated  chase followed. Luckily the carcass of the springbuck, which was left  behind, was too great a prize to be parted with, and the enemy captured  it in preference to the huntsmen!    At this time there was great consternation in camp, as two cavalry  officers were taken prisoners. It subsequently transpired that the  officers, Lieutenant Till (Carabineers) and Lieutenant Hedger (attached  to the 10th Hussars), were captured through an unfortunate accident.  They mistook the Boers for New Zealanders, and therefore were unprepared  to offer resistance. On discovering their error they made a desperate  attempt to escape, but were overpowered.    The Colonials afterwards discarded their picturesque hats and took to  helmets. Owing to the resemblance of their headgear to that of the  Boers, some British pickets had mistaken them for the enemy and fired on  them.    On the 29th the enemy fell back on Colesberg, and there with his small  force General French proceeded to tackle him. \"So near and yet so far\"  must have been repeated many times by both Generals French and Gatacre  when each failed to accomplish some clever moves for want of the  necessary reinforcements. In the ordinary course of things, from  Naauwpoort to Sterkstroom was an easy three-hours journey by rail, but  now, with the barrier of the Boers at Stormberg--the junction between  the East London and Port Elizabeth systems--it was necessary to travel,  if by rail, _via_ Port Elizabeth, thus making a three-days instead of a  three-hours trip. And railway travelling was by no means a safe and  enjoyable exercise. True, the lines of communication were protected by  some eleven hundred Volunteers, but as martial law had not been  proclaimed south of Naauwpoort, and disloyalty was here the rule and not  the exception, it was quite on the cards that at any moment culverts  would be found blown up and rails twisted.          CHAPTER IV    THE COLONIALS AT BELMONT      On Christmas Day Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher, formerly of the Northumberland  Fusiliers, late of the Bedfordshire Regiment, arrived at Belmont and  took command of the troops. The Station Staff now consisted of Colonel  Pilcher; Major Bayly, Major MacDougall, and Major Dennison. The garrison  was soon strengthened by two companies of the 2nd Duke of Cornwall's  Light Infantry under Major Ashby. A general state of high polish was  begun, and the Canadians, ever active and on the alert, came in for some  excellent training, which they were not slow to profit by. Owing to the  insecure state of the neighbourhood, it was put in a fair state of  defence. Stone sconces were built on the kopjes; earthwork trenches were  built at the station and elsewhere; and a series of alarm drills was  carried on, in order to enable all concerned to take up their especial  posts at a moment's notice. For instance, at an appointed hour an alarm  on the bugles would wake the echoes. The men would rush to arms; every  company, previously instructed, would fall in on its own private parade  ground, and then set out at the double for its post. Celerity without  fluster was the motto of the movement. When all were posted, some in  trenches a mile off, others three or four hundred yards away, the  Colonel would proceed to make such disposition of his troops as the  imagined enemy might impose. For instance, he would picture the attack  coming from the north-east and march some of his force in the direction  of the assumed attack, covering it with a strong line of skirmishers,  while other troops in springless four-wheeled buck waggons were sent to  their support. The movement would be only sufficiently developed to give  the men an intelligent appreciation of what might be required of them,  and certainly nothing could exceed the promptness and alacrity with  which the troops threw themselves into their military rehearsals. The  Canadians especially distinguished themselves by their zest and  acuteness, and in all the bogus engagements--the attack drill--earned  the praise of the commander. The following is a copy of a regimental  order: \"The officer commanding the Royal Canadian Regiment is desired by  the officer commanding the troops at this station to express his  satisfaction with the intelligent and quiet way in which this morning's  work was carried out by the officers, non-commissioned officers, and  men of the Royal Canadian Regiment.\" The Colonel particularly  appreciated the manner in which the men avoided \"bunching,\" the most  fatal error that can be made by troops in modern warfare of the kind in  hand.    At the end of the year more Australians arrived. These troops had been  stationed for a short time at the Orange River, getting their horses  into condition after a six weeks' voyage. From thence they moved on to  Belmont. The two companies of Queensland's Mounted Infantry found their  green tents awaiting them, and a hearty welcome. The men, a hardy and  stalwart set, tall and comely to look on, were well fitted in their  kharki uniform, which showed no signs of relationship to the slouching  apparel peculiar to hastily rigged-out troops. Their jackets, cord  breeches, felt hats looped up at the side with a tuft of feathers of the  emu, gave them a picturesque as well as workmanlike air. But their  leggings were dangerously dark, and scarcely as suited to sand or  morass--the ground was either one thing or the other--as the familiar  puttees. These useful articles had now been"]]]
