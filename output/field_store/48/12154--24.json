They simply stated that Derwent Conniston, of the Connistons of  Darlington, was wanted for burglary--and that up to date he had not  been found.    Keith gave a gasp of incredulity. He looked again to see that his eyes  were not tricking him. And it was there in cold, implacable print.  Derwent Conniston--that phoenix among men, by whom he had come to  measure all other men, that Crichton of nerve, of calm and audacious  courage, of splendid poise--a burglar! It was cheap, farcical, an  impossible absurdity. Had it been murder, high treason, defiance of  some great law, a great crime inspired by a great passion or a great  ideal, but it was burglary, brigandage of the cheapest and most  commonplace variety, a sneaking night-coward's plagiarism of real  adventure and real crime. It was impossible. Keith gritted the words  aloud. He might have accepted Conniston as a Dick Turpin, a Claude  Duval or a Macheath, but not as a Jeremy Diddler or a Bill Sykes. The  printed lines were lies. They must be. Derwent Conniston might have  killed a dozen men, but he had never cracked a safe. To think it was to  think the inconceivable.    He turned to the letters. They were postmarked Darlington, England. His  fingers tingled as he opened the first. It was as he had expected, as  he had hoped. They were from Mary Josephine. He arranged them--nine in  all--in the sequence of their dates, which ran back nearly eight years.  All of them had been written within a period of eleven months. They  were as legible as print. And as he passed from the first to the  second, and from the second to the third, and then read on into the  others, he forgot there was such a thing as time and that Mary  Josephine was waiting for him. The clippings had told him one thing;  here, like bits of driftage to be put together, a line in this place  and half a dozen in that, in paragraphs that enlightened and in others  that puzzled, was the other side of the story, a growing thing that  rose up out of mystery and doubt in segments and fractions of segments  adding themselves together piecemeal, welding the whole into form and  substance, until there rode through Keith's veins a wild thrill of  exultation and triumph.    And then he came to the ninth and last letter. It was in a different  handwriting, brief, with a deadly specificness about it that gripped  Keith as he read.    This ninth letter he held in his hand as he rose from the table, and  out of his mouth there fell, unconsciously, Conniston's own words,  \"It's devilish queer, old top--and funny!\"    There was no humor in the way he spoke them. His voice was hard, his  eyes dully ablaze. He was looking back into that swirling, unutterable  loneliness of the northland, and he was seeing Conniston again.    Fiercely he caught up the clippings, struck a match, and with a grim  smile watched them as they curled up into flame and crumbled into ash.  What a lie was life, what a malformed thing was justice, what a monster  of iniquity the man-fabricated thing called law!    And again he found himself speaking, as if the dead Englishman himself  were repeating the words, \"It's devilish queer, old top--and funny!\"          XIV      A quarter of an hour later, with Mary Josephine at his side, he was  walking down the green slope toward the Saskatchewan. In that direction  lay the rims of timber, the shimmering valley, and the broad pathways  that opened into the plains beyond.    The town was at their backs, and Keith wanted it there. He wanted to  keep McDowell, and Shan Tung, and Miriam Kirkstone as far away as  possible, until his mind rode more smoothly in the new orbit in which  it was still whirling a bit unsteadily. More than all else he wanted to  be alone with Mary Josephine, to make sure of her, to convince himself  utterly that she was his to go on fighting for. He sensed the nearness  and the magnitude of the impending drama. He knew that today he must  face Shan Tung, that again he must go under the battery of McDowell's  eyes and brain, and that like a fish in treacherous waters he must swim  cleverly to avoid the nets that would entangle and destroy him. Today  was the day--the stage was set, the curtain about to be lifted, the  play ready to be enacted. But before it was the prologue. And the  prologue was Mary Josephine's.    At the crest of a dip halfway down the slope they had paused, and in  this pause he stood a half-step behind her so that he could look at her  for a moment without being observed. She was bareheaded, and it came  upon him all at once how wonderful was a woman's hair, how beautiful  beyond all other things beautiful and desirable. In twisted, glowing  seductiveness it was piled up on Mary Josephine's head, transformed  into brown and gold glories by the sun. He wanted to put forth his hand  to it, and bury his fingers in it, and feel the thrill and the warmth  and the crush of the palpitant life of it against his own flesh. And  then, bending a little forward, he saw under her long lashes the sheer  joy of life shining in her eyes as she drank in the wonderful panorama  that lay below them to the west. Last night's rain had freshened it,  the sun glorified it now, and the fragrance of earthly smells that rose  up to them from it was the undefiled breath of a thing living and  awake. Even to Keith the river had never looked more beautiful, and  never had his yearnings gone out to it more strongly than in this  moment, to the river and beyond--and to the back of beyond, where the  mountains rose up to meet the blue sky and the river itself was born.  And he heard Mary Josephine's voice, joyously suppressed, exclaiming  softly,    \"Oh, Derry!\"    His heart was filled with gladness. She, too, was seeing what his eyes  saw in that wonderland. And she was feeling it. Her hand, seeking his  hand, crept into his palm, and the fingers of it clung to his fingers.  He could feel the thrill of the miracle passing through her, the  miracle of the open spaces, the miracle of the forests rising billow on  billow to the purple mists of the horizon, the miracle of the golden  Saskatchewan rolling slowly and peacefully in its slumbering sheen out  of that mighty mysteryland that reached to the lap of the setting sun.  He spoke to her of that land as she looked, wide-eyed, quick-breathing,  her fingers closing still more tightly about his. This was but the  beginning of the glory of the west and the north, he told her. Beyond  that low horizon, where the tree tops touched the sky were the  prairies--not the tiresome monotony which she had seen from the car  windows, but the wide, glorious, God-given country of the Northwest  with its thousands of lakes and rivers and its tens of thousands of  square miles of forests; and beyond those things, still farther, were  the foothills, and beyond the foothills the mountains. And in those  mountains the river down there had its beginning.    She looked up swiftly, her eyes brimming with the golden flash of the  sun. \"It is wonderful! And just over there is the town!\"    \"Yes, and beyond the town are the cities.\"    \"And off there--\"    \"God's country,\" said Keith devoutly.    Mary Josephine drew a deep breath. \"And people still live in towns and  cities!\" she exclaimed in wondering credulity. \"I've dreamed of 'over  here,' Derry, but I never dreamed that. And you've had it for years and  years, while I--oh, Derry!\"    And again those two words filled his heart with gladness, words of  loving reproach, atremble with the mysterious whisper of a great  desire. For she was looking into the west. And her eyes and her heart  and her soul were in the west, and suddenly Keith saw his way as though  lighted by a flaming torch. He came near to forgetting that he was  Conniston. He spoke of his dream, his desire, and told her that last  night--before she came--he had made up his mind to go. She had come to  him just in time. A little later and he would have been gone, buried  utterly away from the world in the wonderland of the mountains. And now  they would go together. They would go as he had planned to go, quietly,  unobtrusively; they would slip away and disappear. There was a reason  why no one should know, not even McDowell. It must be their secret.  Some day he would tell her why. Her heart thumped excitedly as he went  on like a boy planning a wonderful day. He could see the swifter beat  of it in the flush that rose into her face and the joy glowing  tremulously in her eyes as she looked at him. They would get ready  quietly. They might go tomorrow, the next day, any time. It would be a  glorious adventure, just they two, with all the vastness of that  mountain paradise ahead of them.    \"We'll be pals,\" he said. \"Just you and me, Mary Josephine. We're all  that's left.\"    It was his first experiment, his first reference to the information he  had gained in the letters, and swift as a flash Mary Josephine's eyes  turned up to him. He nodded, smiling. He understood their quick  questioning, and he held her hand closer and began to walk with her  down the slope.    \"A lot of it came back last night and this morning, a lot of it,\" he  explained. \"It's queer what miracles small things can work sometimes,  isn't it? Think what a grain of sand can do to a watch! This was one of  the small things.\" He was still smiling as he touched the scar on his  forehead. \"And you, you were the other miracle. And I'm remembering. It  doesn't seem like seven or eight years, but only yesterday, that the  grain of sand got mixed up somewhere in the machinery in my head. And I  guess there was another reason for my going wrong. You'll understand,  when I tell you.\"    Had he been Conniston it could not have come from him more naturally,  more sincerely. He was living the great lie, and yet to him it was no  longer a lie. He did not hesitate, as shame and conscience might have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#18)"],[1,"to Lac Bain. And he is afraid--that devil! He is waiting. With  that blackening hand, he is afraid to start back alone--and so I go  with him. And--listen, ma Nepeese. We will be away by sundown, and  there is something you must know before I go.\"    Baree saw them there, close together in the shadows thrown by the tall  spruce trees. He heard the low murmur of their voices--chiefly of  Pierrot's, and at last he saw Nepeese put her two arms up around the  man-beast's neck, and then Pierrot went away again into the forest. He  thought that the Willow would never turn her face toward him after  that. For a long time she stood looking in the direction which Pierrot  had taken. And when after a time she turned and came back to Baree, she  did not look like the Nepeese who had been twining flowers in her hair.  The laughter was gone from her face and eyes. She knelt down beside him  and with sudden fierceness she cried:    \"It is pechipoo, Baree! It was you--you--who put the poison in his  blood. And I hope he dies! For I am afraid--afraid!\"    She shivered.    Perhaps it was in this moment that the Great Spirit of things meant  Baree to understand--that at last it was given him to comprehend that  his day had dawned, that the rising and the setting of his sun no  longer existed in the sky but in this girl whose hand rested on his  head. He whined softly, and inch by inch he dragged himself nearer to  her until again his head rested in the hollow of her lap.        CHAPTER 15    For a long time after Pierrot left them the Willow did not move from  the spot where she had seated herself beside Baree. It was at last the  deepening shadows and a low rumble in the sky that roused her from the  fear of the things Pierrot had told her. When she looked up, black  clouds were massing slowly over the open space above the spruce tops.  Darkness was falling. In the whisper of the wind and the dead stillness  of the thickening gloom there was the sullen brewing of storm. Tonight  there would be no glorious sunset. There would be no twilight hour in  which to follow the trail, no moon, no stars--and unless Pierrot and  the factor were already on their way, they would not start in the face  of the pitch blackness that would soon shroud the forest.    Nepeese shivered and rose to her feet. For the first time Baree got up,  and he stood close at her side. Above them a flash of lightning cut the  clouds like a knife of fire, followed in an instant by a terrific crash  of thunder. Baree shrank back as if struck a blow. He would have slunk  into the shelter of the brush wall of the wigwam, but there was  something about the Willow as he looked at her which gave him  confidence. The thunder crashed again. But he retreated no farther. His  eyes were fixed on Nepeese.    She stood straight and slim in that gathering gloom riven by the  lightning, her beautiful head thrown back, her lips parted, and her  eyes glowing with an almost eager anticipation--a sculptured goddess  welcoming with bated breath the onrushing forces of the heavens.  Perhaps it was because she was born during a night of storm. Many times  Pierrot and the dead princess mother had told her that--how on the  night she had come into the world the crash of thunder and the flare of  lightning had made the hours an inferno, how the streams had burst over  their banks and the stems of ten thousand forest trees had snapped in  its fury--and the beat of the deluge on their cabin roof had drowned  the sound of her mother's pain, and of her own first babyish cries.    On that night, it may be, the Spirit of Storm was born in Nepeese. She  loved to face it, as she was facing it now. It made her forget all  things but the splendid might of nature. Her half-wild soul thrilled to  the crash and fire of it. Often she had reached up her bare arms and  laughed with joy as the deluge burst about her. Even now she might have  stood there in the little open until the rain fell, if a whine from  Baree had not caused her to turn. As the first big drops struck with  the dull thud of leaden bullets about them, she went with him into the  balsam shelter.    Once before Baree had passed through a night of terrible storm--the  night he had hidden himself under a root and had seen the tree riven by  lightning; but now he had company, and the warmth and soft pressure of  the Willow's hand on his head and neck filled him with a strange  courage. He growled softly at the crashing thunder. He wanted to snap  at the lightning flashes. Under her hand Nepeese felt the stiffening of  his body, and in a moment of uncanny stillness she heard the sharp,  uneasy click of his teeth. Then the rain fell.    It was not like other rains Baree had known. It was an inundation  sweeping down out of the blackness of the skies. Within five minutes  the interior of the balsam shelter was a shower bath. After half an  hour of that torrential downpour, Nepeese was soaked to the skin. The  water ran in little rivulets down her body. It trickled in tiny streams  from her drenched braids and dropped from her long lashes, and the  blanket under her became wet as a mop. To Baree it was almost as bad as  his near-drowning in the stream after his fight with Papayuchisew, and  he snuggled closer and closer under the sheltering arm of the Willow.  It seemed an interminable time before the thunder rolled far to the  east, and the lightning died away into distant and intermittent  flashings. Even after that the rain fell for another hour. Then it  stopped as suddenly as it had begun.    With a laughing gasp Nepeese rose to her feet. The water gurgled in her  moccasins as she walked out into the open. She paid no attention to  Baree--and he followed her. Across the open in the treetops the last of  the storm clouds were drifting away. A star shone--then another; and  the Willow stood watching them as they appeared until there were so  many she could not count. It was no longer black. A wonderful starlight  flooded the open after the inky gloom of the storm.    Nepeese looked down and saw Baree. He was standing quietly and  unleashed, with freedom on all sides of him. Yet he did not run. He was  waiting, wet as a water rat, with his eyes fixed on her expectantly.  Nepeese made a movement toward him, and hesitated.    \"No, you will not run away, Baree. I will leave you free. And now we  must have a fire!\"    A fire! Anyone but Pierrot might have said that she was crazy. Not a  stem or twig in the forest that was not dripping! They could hear the  trickle of running water all about them.    \"A fire,\" she said again. \"Let us hunt for the wuskisi, Baree.\"    With her wet clothes clinging to her lightly, she was like a slim  shadow as she crossed the soggy clearing and lost herself among the  forest trees. Baree still followed. She went straight to a birch tree  that she had located that day and began tearing off the loose bark. An  armful of this bark she carried close to the wigwam, and on it she  heaped load after load of wet wood until she had a great pile. From a  bottle in the wigwam she secured a dry match, and at the first touch of  its tiny flame the birch bark flared up like paper soaked in oil. Half  an hour later the Willow's fire--if there had been no forest walls to  hide it--could have been seen at the cabin a mile away. Not until it  was blazing a dozen feet into the air did she cease piling wood on it.  Then she drove sticks into the soft ground and over these sticks she  stretched the blanket out to dry.    So their first night passed--storm, the cool, deep pool, the big fire;  and later, when the Willow's clothes and the blanket had dried, a few  hours' sleep. At dawn they returned to the cabin. It was a cautious  approach. There was no smoke coming from the chimney. The door was  closed. Pierrot and Bush McTaggart were gone.        CHAPTER 16    It was the beginning of August--the Flying-up Moon--when Pierrot  returned from Lac Bain, and in three days more it would be the Willow's  seventeenth birthday. He brought back with him many things for  Nepeese--ribbons for her hair, real shoes, which she wore at times like  the two Englishwomen at Nelson House, and chief glory of all, some  wonderful red cloth for a dress. In the three winters she had spent at  the mission these women had made much of Nepeese. They had taught her  to sew as well as to spell and read and pray, and at times there came  to the Willow a compelling desire to do as they did.    So for three days Nepeese worked hard on her new dress and on her  birthday she stood before Pierrot in a fashion that took his breath  away. She had piled her hair in great coils on the crown of her head,  as Yvonne, the younger of the Englishwomen, had taught her, and in the  rich jet of it had half buried a vivid sprig of the crimson fireflower.  Under this, and the glow in her eyes, and the red flush of her lips and  cheeks came the wonderful red dress, fitted to the slim and sinuous  beauty of her form--as the style had been two winters ago at Nelson  House. And below the dress, which reached just below the knees--Nepeese  had quite forgotten the proper length, or else her material had run  out--came the coup de maitre of her toilet, real stockings and the gay  shoes with high heels! She was a vision before which the gods of the  forests might have felt their hearts stop beating. Pierrot turned her  round and round without a word, but smiling. When she left him,  however, followed by Baree, and limping a little because of the  tightness of her shoes, the smile faded from his face, leaving it cold  and bleak.    \"Mon Dieu,\" he whispered to himself in French, with a thought that was  like a sharp stab at his heart, \"she is not of her mother's blood--non.  It is French. She is--yes--like an angel.\"    A change had come over Pierrot. During the three days she had been  engaged in her dressmaking, Nepeese had been quite too excited to  notice this change, and Pierrot had"]]]
