There is no devil but the evil passions of  humanity. And as for Cipriano's definition of God--it is good, yes; it  is great, yes; but who can shut God into a definition? One might as  well try to scoop up the ocean in a cocoanut shell. No! All religions  are human fictions. We have come, nobody knows whence or why, into  this paltry, foolish, sordid life, for most of us only a fight to gain  the bread, and afterward--_Bueno!_ I am on the brink of the jump, and  the priests have not frightened me yet. Afterward? _Vamos a ver!_\"    This man had heard of Protestantism simply as an ignorant notion of  the lower classes. For the typical Spanish Protestant of to-day  presents a striking contrast to the typical Spanish Protestant of the  Reformation. When heresy first entered the Peninsula, it gained almost  no footing among the common people, who supposed Luther to be another  sort of devil and the Protestants a new variety of Jews or Moors; but  the rank and learning of Spain, the youthful nobility, illustrious  preachers and writers, officers and favorites of the Court, even men  and women in whose veins flowed the blood royal, welcomed with ardor  the wave that was surging over Europe. The very eminence of these  heretics sealed their doom. The Inquisition could not miss such  shining marks. The Holy Office did its work with abominable  thoroughness. Apart from the countless multitudes whom it did to death  in dungeon and torture-chamber, it burned more than thirty thousand of  the most valuable citizens of Spain and drove forth from the Peninsula  some three millions of Jews and Moors. The _autos de fe_ were  festivals. Among the wedding pomps for the French bride of Philip II,  a girl thirteen years old, was one of these horrible spectacles at  Toledo. The holiday fires of Seville and Valladolid drank the most  precious blood of Andalusia and Castile. Though Saragossa had a mind  to Huguenot fuel; though Pamplona, on one festal day, heaped up a  holocaust of ten thousand Jews; though Granada, Murcia, and Valencia  whetted their cruel piety on the Moors who had made the southern  provinces a garden of delight; yet in all these cities, as in Toledo,  Logrono, and the rest, the Spanish stock itself was drained of its  finest and most highly cultivated intelligence, its sincerest  conscience, purest valor, its most original and independent thought.  Spain has been paying the penalty ever since. Her history from Philip  II has been a judgment day.    No root of the Lutheran heresy survived in the Peninsula. The new  Protestantism does not spring from the old. The blood of the Spanish  martyrs was not the seed of the Spanish church. The Protestant of  to-day is far removed, socially and politically, from the courtiers,  marquises, knights of Santiago--those gallant cavaliers who were  stripped upon the scaffold of their honorable decorations and clad in  the yellow robe of infamy. This nineteenth-century Protestant may be a  lawyer or a journalist, but by exception. Ordinarily he is a petty  farmer, a small shop-keeper, mechanic, miner, day-laborer, of humble  calling and of lowly life. In politics he is almost surely a  republican. When the monarchy was overthrown, in '68, Protestantism  was, for the moment, in favor, and hundreds of the triumphant party  hastened to profess the reformed faith. With the return of a Roman  Catholic court and perhaps upon the discovery that the new  Christianity, too, has its burden and its yoke, many fell away.    Yet Protestantism has now an assured footing in Spain. Protestant  churches may be found in most of the important cities. There are some  fifty foreign preachers and teachers in the field, aided by nearly  eighty Spanish pastors and colporteurs. The number of Spanish  communicants is between three and four thousand, the church attendance  is reckoned at nine thousand, and there are five thousand Spanish  children in the Protestant schools. Several centres have been  established for the sale of Bibles and Protestant books, and six or  seven Protestant periodicals are published and circulated. In answer  to the continual Romish taunt that Protestantism is a war of sects, a  house divided against itself, a Protestant Union was organized at  Madrid in the spring of 1899. All, save two, of the fifteen missions,  supported by various societies of Great Britain, Germany,  Switzerland, and America, joined hands in this. Only the Plymouth  Brethren and the Church of England held aloof.      [Illustration: A MILKMAN OF GRANADA]    The Inquisition exists no longer. Religious liberty, even in Spain,  has the support of law. Yet still the Spanish Protestant, this poor,  plain Protestant of to-day, as obscure as those Galilean fishermen  whom the Master called, is harassed by petty persecutions. Children  sing insulting verses after him in the street, especially that pious  ditty:--         \"Get away with you, Protestants,           Out of our Catholic Spain,       That the Sacred Heart, the Sacred Heart,           May love our land again.\"    He is jealously watched on the passing of \"His Majesty the Wafer\" and  pursued with mud and spittings if he fails to do it homage. College  boys rub charcoal over the front of his chapel and stone his  schoolroom windows; work is refused him; promotion denied him; his  rent is higher than his neighbor's, yet not his neighbor's family nor  his landlord's cross his threshold. If scorn can burn, he feels the  _auto de fe_.          VIII    AN ANDALUSIAN TYPE         \"'True,' quoth Sancho: 'but I have heard say there are more       friars in heaven than knights-errant.' 'It may be so,' replied       Don Quixote, 'because their number is much greater than that       of knights-errant.' 'And yet,' quoth Sancho, 'there are       abundance of the errant sort.' 'Abundance indeed,' answered       Don Quixote, 'but few who deserve the name of       knights.'\"--CERVANTES: _Don Quixote_.      It might have been in Seville, though it was not, that I met my most  _simpatico_ example of the Andalusian. He was of old Sierra stock,  merry as the sunshine and gracious as the shadows. Huge of build and  black as the blackest, he was as gentle as a great Newfoundland dog,  until some flying spark of a word set the dark fires blazing in his  eyes. This was no infrequent occurrence, for the travelling  Englishman, as frank as he is patriotic, cannot comprehend the zest  with which well-to-do Spaniards, even in time of war, escape military  service by a money payment. Not the height and girth of our young  giant, nor his cordial courtesy and winning playfulness, shielded him  from the blunt question, \"Why didn't you go over to Cuba, a great  fellow like you, and fight for your flag?\" His usual rejoinder was the  eloquent Southern shrug of the shoulder, twist of the eyebrow, and  waving lift of the hand, with the not easily answerable words, \"And to  what good?\" But now and then the query came from such a source or was  delivered with so keen a thrust that his guarded feeling outleaped  reserve. The sarcasms and mockeries that then surged from him in a  bitter torrent were directed chiefly against Spain, although the  American eagle rarely went scot-free. \"Ah, yes, it is a fine fowl,  that! He has the far-seeing eye; he has the philanthropic beak and  claw!\" But it was the golden lion of Spain against which his harshest  gibes were hurled--\"_un animal domestico_, that does not bite.\"    No one of the party was a tithe as outspoken as our Spaniard himself  in condemning the errors of the Spanish campaign or censuring the  methods of the Spanish Government. If he turned angrily toward a  criticism from a foreigner, it was only, in the second instant, to  catch it up like a ball and toss it himself from one hand to the  other--like a ball that burns the fingers.    Such wrath can easily be the seamy side of love, and, in a way, the  man's national pride was measured by his national shame; but always  over these outbursts there brooded that something hopelessly resigned,  drearily fatalistic, which seems to vitiate the Spanish indignation  for any purposes of practical reform. To suggestions of sympathy he  responded with a pathetic weariness of manner, this handsome young  Hercules, so radiant with the joy of life, who, in his normal mood,  sprinkled mirth and mischief from him as a big dog shakes off water  drops.    \"What can one do? I am a Spaniard. I say it to myself a hundred times  a day. I am a Spaniard, and I wish my country were worth the fighting  for, worth the dying for. But is it? Is it worth the toothache? God  knows the truth, and let it rest there. Oh, you need not tell me of  its past. It was once the most glorious of nations. Spaniards were  lords of the West. But--ah, I know, I know--Spain has never learned  how to rule her colonies. He who sows brambles reaps thorns. The  Church, too, has done much harm in Spain--not more harm than another.  I am a Catholic, but as I see it, priests differ from other men only  in this--in the cafe sit some bad men and many good, and in the choir  kneel some good priests and many bad. The devil lurks behind the  cross. But Spain will never give up her Church. It is burned in. You  are a heretic, and like my figure, do you not? It is burned in. There  is no hope for Spain but to sink her deep under the earth, and build a  new Spain on top. And why do I not work for that new Spain? How may a  man work? There is talk enough in Spain as it is. Most Spaniards talk  and do no more. They go to the cafes and, when they have emptied their  cups, they draw figures on the tables and they talk. That is all. The  new Spain will never come. What should it be? Oh, I know better what  it should not be. It should have no king. A republic--that is right.  Perhaps not a republic precisely like America.

Get the look in his eyes, then--you who do not mind seeing such  things--and answer, honestly: Is there anything sadder on earth? All  this, before the pursuit of boys and the fever of thirst and the final  knowledge of desolation have turned him from a handsome and prideful  pet into a slinking outcast.    Yes, a lost dog is the saddest thing that can meet the gaze of a man  or woman who understands dogs. As perhaps my story may help to  show--or perhaps not.           *       *       *       *       *    Lad had been brushed and bathed, daily, for a week, until his  mahogany-and-snow coat shone. All this, at The Place, far up in the  North Jersey hinterland and all to make him presentable for the  Westminster Kennel Show at New York's Madison Square Garden. After  which, his two gods, the Mistress and the Master took him for a  thirty-mile ride in The Place's only car, one morning.    The drive began at The Place--the domain where Lad had ruled as King  among the lesser folk for so many years. It ended at Madison Square  Garden, where the annual four-day dog show was in progress.    You have read how Lad fared at that show--how, at the close of the  first day, when he had two victories to his credit, the Mistress had  taken pity on his misery and had decreed that he should be taken home,  without waiting out the remaining three days of torture-ordeal.    The Master went out first, to get the car and bring it around  to the side exit of the Garden. The Mistress gathered up Lad's  belongings--his brush, his dog biscuits, etc., and followed, with Lad  himself.    Out of the huge building, with its reverberating barks and yells from  two thousand canine throats, she went. Lad paced, happy and majestic,  at her side. He knew he was going home, and the unhappiness of the  hideous day dropped from him.    At the exit, the Mistress was forced to leave a deposit of five  dollars, \"to insure the return of the dog to his bench\" (to which  bench of agony she vowed, secretly, Lad should never return). Then she  was told the law demands that all dogs in New York City streets shall  be muzzled.    In vain she explained that Lad would be in the streets only for such  brief time as the car would require to journey to the One Hundred and  Thirtieth Street ferry. The door attendant insisted that the law was  inexorable. So, lest a policeman hold up the car for such disobedience  to the city statutes, the Mistress reluctantly bought a muzzle.    It was a big, awkward thing, made of steel, and bound on with leather  straps. It looked like a rat-trap. And it fenced in the nose and  mouth of its owner with a wicked criss-cross of shiny metal bars.    Never in all his years had Lad worn a muzzle. Never, until to-day,  had he been chained. The splendid eighty-pound collie had been as free  of The Place and of the forests as any human; and with no worse  restrictions than his own soul and conscience put upon him.    To him this muzzle was a horror. Not even the loved touch of the  Mistress' dear fingers, as she adjusted the thing to his beautiful  head, could lessen the degradation. And the discomfort of it--a  discomfort that amounted to actual pain--was almost as bad as the  humiliation.    With his absurdly tiny white forepaws, the huge dog sought to dislodge  the torture-implement. He strove to rub it off against the Mistress'  skirt. But beyond shifting it so that the forehead strap covered one  of his eyes, he could not budge it.    Lad looked up at the Mistress in wretched appeal. His look held no  resentment, nothing but sad entreaty. She was his deity. All his life  she had given him of her gentleness, her affection, her sweet  understanding. Yet, to-day, she had brought him to this abode of noisy  torment, and had kept him there from morning to dusk. And now--just as  the vigil seemed ended--she was tormenting him, to nerve-rack, by this  contraption she had fastened over his nose. Lad did not rebel. But he  besought. And the Mistress understood.    \"Laddie, dear!\" she whispered, as she led him across the sidewalk to  the curb where the Master waited for the car. \"Laddie, old friend,  I'm just as sorry about it as you are. But it's only for a few  minutes. Just as soon as we get to the ferry, we'll take it off and  throw it into the river. And we'll never bring you again where dogs  have to wear such things. I promise. It's only for a few minutes.\"    The Mistress, for once, was mistaken. Lad was to wear the accursed  muzzle for much, _much_ longer than \"a few minutes.\"    \"Give him the back seat to himself, and come in front here with me,\"  suggested the Master, as the Mistress and Lad arrived alongside the  car. \"The poor old chap has been so cramped up and pestered all day  that he'll like to have a whole seat to stretch out on.\"    Accordingly, the Mistress opened the door and motioned Lad to the back  seat. At a bound the collie was on the cushion, and proceeded to curl  up thereon. The Mistress got into the front seat with the Master. The  car set forth on its six-mile run to the ferry.    Now that his face was turned homeward, Lad might have found vast  interest in his new surroundings, had not the horrible muzzle absorbed  all his powers of emotion. The Milan Cathedral, the Taj Mahal, the  Valley of the Arno at sunset--these be sights to dream of for  years. But show them to a man who has an ulcerated tooth, or whose  tight, new shoes pinch his soft corn, and he will probably regard them  as Lad just then viewed the twilight New York streets.    He was a dog of forest and lake and hill, this giant collie with his  mighty shoulders and tiny white feet and shaggy burnished coat and  mournful eyes. Never before had he been in a city. The myriad blended  noises confused and deafened him. The myriad blended smells assailed  his keen nostrils. The swirl of countless multicolored lights stung  and blurred his vision. Noises, smells and lights were all jarringly  new to him. So were the jostling masses of people on the sidewalk and  the tangle and hustle of vehicular traffic through which the Master  was threading the car's way with such difficulty.    But, newest and most sickening of all the day's novelties was the  muzzle.    Lad was quite certain the Mistress did not realize how the muzzle was  hurting him nor how he detested it. In all her dealings with him--or  with anyone or anything else--the Mistress had never been unkind; and  most assuredly not cruel. It must be she did not understand. At all  events, she had not scolded or forbidden, when he had tried to rub the  muzzle off. So the wearing of this new torture was apparently no part  of the Law. And Lad felt justified in striving again to remove it.    In vain he pawed the thing, first with one foot, then with both. He  could joggle it from side to side, but that was all. And each shift of  the steel bars hurt his tender nose and tenderer sensibilities worse  than the one before. He tried to rub it off against the seat  cushion--with the same distressing result.    Lad looked up at the backs of his gods, and whined very softly. The  sound went unheard, in the babel of noise all around him. Nor did the  Mistress, or the Master turn around, on general principles, to speak a  word of cheer to the sufferer. They were in a mixup of crossways  traffic that called for every atom of their attention, if they were to  avoid collision. It was no time for conversation or for dog-patting.    Lad got to his feet and stood, uncertainly, on the slippery leather  cushion, seeking to maintain his balance, while he rubbed a corner of  the muzzle against one of the supports of the car's lowered top.  Working away with all his might, he sought to get leverage that would  pry loose the muzzle.    Just then there was a brief gap in the traffic. The Master put on  speed, and, darting ahead of a delivery truck, sharply rounded the  corner into a side street.    The car's sudden twist threw Lad clean off his precarious balance on  the seat, and hurled him against one of the rear doors.    The door, insecurely shut, could not withstand the eighty-pound  impact. It burst open. And Lad was flung out onto the greasy asphalt  of the avenue.    He landed full on his side, in the muck of the roadway, with a force  that shook the breath clean out of him. Directly above his head glared  the twin lights of the delivery truck the Master had just shot  past. The truck was going at a good twelve miles an hour. And the dog  had fallen within six feet of its fat front wheels.    Now, a collie is like no other animal on earth. He is, at worst, more  wolf than dog. And, at best, he has more of the wolf's lightning-swift  instinct than has any other breed of canine. For which reason Lad was  not, then and there, smashed, flat and dead, under the fore-wheels of  a three-ton truck.    Even as the tires grazed his fur, Lad gathered himself compactly  together, his feet well under him, and sprang far to one side. The  lumbering truck missed him by less than six inches. But it missed him.    His leap brought him scramblingly down on all fours, out of the  truck's way, but on the wrong side of the thoroughfare. It brought him  under the very fender of a touring car that was going at a good pace  in the opposite direction. And again, a leap that was inspired by  quick instinct alone, lifted the dog free of this newest death-menace.    He halted and stared piteously around in search of his deities. But in  that glare and swelter of traffic, a trained human eye could not have  recognized any particular car. Moreover, the Mistress and Master were  a full half-block away, down the less crowded side street, and were  making up"]]]
