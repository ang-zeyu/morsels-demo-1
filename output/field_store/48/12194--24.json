They were  constrained by the spirit to bear testimony to the truth, and when they  did this the power of God rested upon them.    \"Desiring to hear more of the saints, in January, 1832, Heber took his  horses and sleigh and started for Columbia, Bradford county, Penn.,  a distance of one hundred and twenty-five miles. Brigham and Phineas  Young and their wives went with him.    \"They stayed with the church about six days, saw the power of God  manifested and heard the gift of tongues, and then returned rejoicing,  bearing testimony to the people by the way. They were not baptized,  however, until the following spring. Brigham was baptized on Sunday,  April 14th, 1832, by Eleazer Miller, and Heber C. Kimball was baptized  the next day.    \"Just two weeks from that time I was baptized by Joseph Young, with  several others.    \"The Holy Ghost fell upon Heber so greatly, that he said it was like  a consuming fire. He felt as though he was clothed in his right mind  and sat at the feet of Jesus; but the people called him crazy. He  continued thus for months, till it seemed his flesh would consume away.  The Scriptures were unfolded to his mind in such a wonderful manner by  the spirit of revelation that he said it seemed he had formerly been  familiar with them.    \"Brigham Young and his wife Miriam, with their two little girls,  Elizabeth and Vilate, were at the time living at our house; but soon  after her baptism Miriam died. In her expiring moments, she clapped her  hands and praised the Lord, and called on all around to help her praise  him; and when her voice was too weak to be heard, her lips and hands  were seen moving until she expired.    \"This was another testimony to them of the powerful effect of the  everlasting gospel, showing that we shall not die, but will sleep and  come forth in the resurrection and rejoice with her in the flesh.    \"Her little girls sister Miriam left to my care, and I did all I could  to be a mother to her little ones to the period of our gathering to  Kirtland, and the marriage of Brigham to Miss Mary Ann Angell.    \"The glorious death of sister Miriam caused us to rejoice in the  midst of affliction. But enemies exulted over our loss and threw many  obstacles in the way of our gathering with the saints.    \"To my husband's great surprise some of the neighbors issued  attachments against his goods; yet he was not indebted to any of them  to the value of five cents, while there were some hundreds of dollars  due to him. However, he left his own debts uncollected, settled their  unjust claims, and gathered to Kirtland with the saints about the last  of September, 1832, in company with Brigham Young.    \"Here I will relate a marvelous incident, of date previous to our  entering the church.    \"On the night of the 22d of September, 1827, while living in the town  of Mendon, after we retired to bed, John P. Green, who was then a  traveling Reformed Methodist preacher, living within one hundred steps  of our house, came and called my husband to come out and see the sight  in the heavens. Heber awoke me, and Sister Fanny Young (sister of  Brigham), who was living with us, and we all went out of doors.    \"It was one of the most beautiful starlight nights, so clear we could  see to pick up a pin. We looked to the eastern horizon, and beheld a  white smoke arise towards the heavens. As it ascended, it formed into a  belt, and made a noise like the rushing wind, and continued southwest,  forming a regular bow, dipping in the western horizon.    \"After the bow had formed, it began to widen out, growing transparent,  of a bluish cast. It grew wide enough to contain twelve men abreast. In  this bow an army moved, commencing from the east and marching to the  west. They continued moving until they reached the western horizon.  They moved in platoons, and walked so close the rear ranks trod in the  steps of their file leaders, until the whole bow was literally crowded  with soldiers.    \"We could distinctly see the muskets, bayonets and knapsacks of the  men, who wore caps and feathers like those used by the American  soldiers in the last war with Great Britain. We also saw their officers  with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of  their instruments of war, and could discern the form and features of  the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army.  When the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time. We  could _hear_ their steps.    \"When the front rank reached the western horizon, a battle ensued, as  we could hear the report of the arms, and the rush.    \"None can judge of our feelings as we beheld this army of spirits as  plainly as ever armies of men were seen in the flesh. Every hair of our  heads seemed alive.    \"We gazed upon this scenery for _hours_, until it began to disappear.    \"After we became acquainted with Mormonism, we learned that this took  place the same evening that Joseph Smith received the records of the  Book of Mormon from the angel Moroni, who had held those records in his  possession.    \"Father Young, and John P. Green's wife (Brigham's sister Rhoda), were  also witnesses of this marvelous scene.    \"Frightened at what we saw, I said, Father Young, what does all this  mean? He answered, Why it is one of the signs of the coming of the Son  of Man.    \"The next night a similar scene was beheld in the west, by the  neighbors, representing armies of men engaged in battle.    \"After our gathering to Kirtland the church was in a state of poverty  and distress. It appeared almost impossible that the commandment to  build the temple could be fulfilled, the revelation requiring it to be  erected by a certain period.    \"The enemies were raging, threatening destruction upon the saints; the  brethren were under guard night and day to preserve the prophet's life,  and the mobs in Missouri were driving our people from Jackson county.    \"In this crisis the 'Camp of Zion' was organized to go to the defence  of the saints in Jackson, Heber being one of the little army. On the  5th of May, 1834, they started. It was truly a solemn morning on which  my husband parted from his wife, children and friends, not knowing that  we should ever meet again in the flesh. On the 26th of July, however,  the brethren returned from their expedition.    \"The saints now labored night and day to build the house of the Lord,  the sisters knitting and spinning to clothe those who labored upon it.    \"When the quorum of the twelve apostles was called, my husband was  chosen one of them, and soon he was out with the rest of the apostles  preaching the gospel of the last days; but they returned on the 27th of  the following September and found their families and friends enjoying  good health and prosperity.    \"The temple was finished and dedicated on the 27th of March, 1836. It  was a season of great rejoicing, indeed, to the saints, and great and  marvelous were the manifestations and power in the Lord's house. Here I  will relate a vision of the prophet concerning the twelve apostles of  this dispensation, for whose welfare his anxiety had been very great.    \"He saw the twelve going forth, and they appeared to be in a far  distant land; after some time they unexpectedly met together,  apparently in great tribulation, their clothes all ragged, and their  knees and feet sore. They formed into a circle, and all stood with  their eyes fixed on the ground. The Saviour appeared and stood in their  midst and wept over them, and wanted to show himself to them, but they  did not discover him.    \"He saw until they had accomplished their work and arrived at the gate  of the celestial city. There Father Adam stood and opened the gate to  them, and as they entered he embraced them one by one, and kissed them.  He then led them to the throne of God, and then the Saviour embraced  each of them in the presence of God. He saw that they all had beautiful  heads of hair and all looked alike. The impression this vision left on  Brother Joseph's mind was of so acute a nature, that he never could  refrain from weeping while rehearsing it.    \"On the l0th of May, 1836, my husband again went East on a mission,  and I made a visit to my friends in Victor, where Heber and I met, and  after spending a few days, returned to Ohio, journeying to Buffalo,  where a magistrate came forward and paid five dollars for our passage  to Fairport.    \"The passengers were chiefly Swiss emigrants. After sitting and hearing  them some time, the spirit of the Lord came upon my husband so that he  was enabled to preach to them in their own language, though of himself  he knew not a word of their language. They seemed much pleased, and  treated him with great kindness.    \"We returned to Kirtland to find a spirit of speculation in the church,  and apostacy growing among some of the apostles and leading elders.  These were perilous times indeed.    \"In the midst of this my husband was called on his mission to Great  Britain, this being the first foreign mission.    \"One day while Heber was seated in the front stand in the Kirtland  temple, the prophet Joseph opened the door and came and whispered in  his ear, 'Brother Heber, the spirit of the Lord has whispered to me,  let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim the gospel, and open  the door of salvation.'\"    Here we may digress a moment from Sister Vilate's story, to illustrate  the view of the apostles \"opening the door of salvation to the  nations,\" and preaching the gospel in foreign lands without purse or  scrip.    At a later period the Mormon apostles and elders have deemed it as  nothing to take missions to foreign lands, but in 1837, before the age  of railroads and steamships had fairly come, going to Great Britain on  mission was very like embarking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#18)"],[1,"r-plots.  The gay little garden of the schoolmaster's  bride was rather a forlorn place now, and the Lombardies and birches  were under bare poles, as Captain Jim said.  But the fir-wood behind  the little house was forever green and staunch; and even in November  and December there came gracious days of sunshine and purple hazes,  when the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer, and  the gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind  seemed only things of a long-past dream.    Anne and Gilbert spent many an autumn evening at the lighthouse.  It  was always a cheery place.  Even when the east wind sang in minor and  the sea was dead and gray, hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all  about it.  Perhaps this was because the First Mate always paraded it in  panoply of gold.  He was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed  the sun, and his resounding purrs formed a pleasant accompaniment to  the laughter and conversation which went on around Captain Jim's  fireplace.  Captain Jim and Gilbert had many long discussions and high  converse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king.    \"I like to ponder on all kinds of problems, though I can't solve 'em,\"  said Captain Jim.  \"My father held that we should never talk of things  we couldn't understand, but if we didn't, doctor, the subjects for  conversation would be mighty few.  I reckon the gods laugh many a time  to hear us, but what matters so long as we remember that we're only men  and don't take to fancying that we're gods ourselves, really, knowing  good and evil.  I reckon our pow-wows won't do us or anyone much harm,  so let's have another whack at the whence, why and whither this  evening, doctor.\"    While they \"whacked,\" Anne listened or dreamed.  Sometimes Leslie went  to the lighthouse with them, and she and Anne wandered along the shore  in the eerie twilight, or sat on the rocks below the lighthouse until  the darkness drove them back to the cheer of the driftwood fire.  Then  Captain Jim would brew them tea and tell them        \"tales of land and sea      And whatsoever might betide      The great forgotten world outside.\"    Leslie seemed always to enjoy those lighthouse carousals very much, and  bloomed out for the time being into ready wit and beautiful laughter,  or glowing-eyed silence.  There was a certain tang and savor in the  conversation when Leslie was present which they missed when she was  absent.  Even when she did not talk she seemed to inspire others to  brilliancy.  Captain Jim told his stories better, Gilbert was quicker  in argument and repartee, Anne felt little gushes and trickles of fancy  and imagination bubbling to her lips under the influence of Leslie's  personality.    \"That girl was born to be a leader in social and intellectual circles,  far away from Four Winds,\" she said to Gilbert as they walked home one  night.  \"She's just wasted here--wasted.\"    \"Weren't you listening to Captain Jim and yours truly the other night  when we discussed that subject generally?  We came to the comforting  conclusion that the Creator probably knew how to run His universe quite  as well as we do, and that, after all, there are no such things as  'wasted' lives, saving and except when an individual wilfully squanders  and wastes his own life--which Leslie Moore certainly hasn't done.  And  some people might think that a Redmond B.A., whom editors were  beginning to honor, was 'wasted' as the wife of a struggling country  doctor in the rural community of Four Winds.\"    \"Gilbert!\"    \"If you had married Roy Gardner, now,\" continued Gilbert mercilessly,  \"YOU could have been 'a leader in social and intellectual circles far  away from Four Winds.'\"    \"Gilbert BLYTHE!\"    \"You KNOW you were in love with him at one time, Anne.\"    \"Gilbert, that's mean--'pisen mean, just like all the men,' as Miss  Cornelia says.  I NEVER was in love with him.  I only imagined I was.  YOU know that.  You KNOW I'd rather be your wife in our house of dreams  and fulfillment than a queen in a palace.\"    Gilbert's answer was not in words; but I am afraid that both of them  forgot poor Leslie speeding her lonely way across the fields to a house  that was neither a palace nor the fulfillment of a dream.    The moon was rising over the sad, dark sea behind them and  transfiguring it.  Her light had not yet reached the harbor, the  further side of which was shadowy and suggestive, with dim coves and  rich glooms and jewelling lights.    \"How the home lights shine out tonight through the dark!\" said Anne.  \"That string of them over the harbor looks like a necklace.  And what a  coruscation there is up at the Glen!  Oh, look, Gilbert; there is ours.  I'm so glad we left it burning.  I hate to come home to a dark house.  OUR homelight, Gilbert!  Isn't it lovely to see?\"    \"Just one of earth's many millions of homes, Anne--girl--but  ours--OURS--our beacon in 'a naughty world.'  When a fellow has a home  and a dear, little, red-haired wife in it what more need he ask of  life?\"    \"Well, he might ask ONE thing more,\" whispered Anne happily.  \"Oh,  Gilbert, it seems as if I just COULDN'T wait for the spring.\"        CHAPTER 15    CHRISTMAS AT FOUR WINDS    At first Anne and Gilbert talked of going home to Avonlea for  Christmas; but eventually they decided to stay in Four Winds.  \"I want  to spend the first Christmas of our life together in our own home,\"  decreed Anne.    So it fell out that Marilla and Mrs. Rachel Lynde and the twins came to  Four Winds for Christmas.  Marilla had the face of a woman who had  circumnavigated the globe.  She had never been sixty miles away from  home before; and she had never eaten a Christmas dinner anywhere save  at Green Gables.    Mrs. Rachel had made and brought with her an enormous plum pudding.  Nothing could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that a college graduate of the  younger generation could make a Christmas plum pudding properly; but  she bestowed approval on Anne's house.    \"Anne's a good housekeeper,\" she said to Marilla in the spare room the  night of their arrival.  \"I've looked into her bread box and her scrap  pail.  I always judge a housekeeper by those, that's what.  There's  nothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown away, and no stale  pieces in the bread box.  Of course, she was trained up with you--but,  then, she went to college afterwards.  I notice she's got my tobacco  stripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round braided mat of yours  before her living-room fire.  It makes me feel right at home.\"    Anne's first Christmas in her own house was as delightful as she could  have wished.  The day was fine and bright; the first skim of snow had  fallen on Christmas Eve and made the world beautiful; the harbor was  still open and glittering.    Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia came to dinner.  Leslie and Dick had been  invited, but Leslie made excuse; they always went to her Uncle Isaac  West's for Christmas, she said.    \"She'd rather have it so,\" Miss Cornelia told Anne.  \"She can't bear  taking Dick where there are strangers.  Christmas is always a hard time  for Leslie.  She and her father used to make a lot of it.\"    Miss Cornelia and Mrs. Rachel did not take a very violent fancy to each  other.  \"Two suns hold not their courses in one sphere.\"  But they did  not clash at all, for Mrs. Rachel was in the kitchen helping Anne and  Marilla with the dinner, and it fell to Gilbert to entertain Captain  Jim and Miss Cornelia,--or rather to be entertained by them, for a  dialogue between those two old friends and antagonists was assuredly  never dull.    \"It's many a year since there was a Christmas dinner here, Mistress  Blythe,\" said Captain Jim.  \"Miss Russell always went to her friends in  town for Christmas.  But I was here to the first Christmas dinner that  was ever eaten in this house--and the schoolmaster's bride cooked it.  That was sixty years ago today, Mistress Blythe--and a day very like  this--just enough snow to make the hills white, and the harbor as blue  as June.  I was only a lad, and I'd never been invited out to dinner  before, and I was too shy to eat enough.  I've got all over THAT.\"    \"Most men do,\" said Miss Cornelia, sewing furiously.  Miss Cornelia was  not going to sit with idle hands, even on Christmas.    Babies come without any consideration for holidays, and there was one  expected in a poverty-stricken household at Glen St. Mary.  Miss  Cornelia had sent that household a substantial dinner for its little  swarm, and so meant to eat her own with a comfortable conscience.    \"Well, you know, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,  Cornelia,\" explained Captain Jim.    \"I believe you--when he HAS a heart,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"I  suppose that's why so many women kill themselves cooking--just as poor  Amelia Baxter did.  She died last Christmas morning, and she said it  was the first Christmas since she was married that she didn't have to  cook a big, twenty-plate dinner.  It must have been a real pleasant  change for her.  Well, she's been dead a year, so you'll soon hear of  Horace Baxter taking notice.\"    \"I heard he was taking notice already,\" said Captain Jim, winking at  Gilbert.  \"Wasn't he up to your place one Sunday lately, with his  funeral blacks on, and a boiled collar?\"    \"No, he wasn't.  And he needn't come neither.  I could have had him  long ago when he was fresh.  I don't want any second-hand goods,  believe ME.  As for Horace Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a  year ago last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and when his  wife died and he got her life insurance he said he believed it was the  answer to his prayer.  Wasn't that like a man?\"    \"Have you really proof that he said that, Cornelia?\"    \"I have the Methodist minister's word for it--if you call THAT proof.  Robert Baxter told me the same thing too, but I admit THAT isn't  evidence.  Robert Baxter isn't often known to tell"]]]
