The culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt  fastened around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then  firmly tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower  grating; a little basin of cold water was placed at his feet, and all was  now prepared. The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the  punishment. The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not use  it on a bull unless in self-defence; the shaft is about a foot and a half  long, and covered with green or red baize, according to taste; the thongs  are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness of a  goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each. Men describe the first blow  as like a shower of molten lead.    \"Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly and  determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate, and as  unflinchingly received.    \"Then, 'One dozen, sir, please,' he reported, saluting the commander.    \"'Continue the punishment,' was the calm reply.    \"A new man, and a new cat. Another dozen reported; again the same reply.  Three dozen. The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to  purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the  suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a  comrade to give him a mouthful of water.    \"There was a tear in the eye of the hardy sailor who obeyed him,  whispering as he did so, 'Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.'    \"'Five, six,' the corporal slowly counted; 'seven, eight.' It is the last  dozen, and how acute must be the torture! 'Nine, ten.' The blood comes now  fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your feelings. The man  was cast loose at last, and put on the sick-list; he had borne his  punishment without a groan, and without moving a muscle. A large pet  monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the time; I  have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was only an  ape_.\"    Dr. Stables gives his opinion on the use of the cat in honest and  outspoken terms. He considers \"corporal punishment, as applied to men,  _cowardly_, _cruel_, and debasing to _human nature_; and as applied to  boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even _fiendish_.\"    The writer has statistics before him which prove that 456 cases of  flogging boys took place in 1875, and that only seven men were punished  during that year. There is every probability that the use of the naval cat  will ere long be abolished, and important as is good discipline on board  ship, there are many leading authorities who believe that it can be  maintained without it. The captain of a vessel is its king, reigning in a  little world of his own, and separated for weeks or months from the  possibility of reprimand. If he is a tyrannical man, he can make his ship  a floating hell for all on board. A system of fines for small offences has  been proposed, and the idea has this advantage, that in case they prove on  investigation to have been unjustly imposed, the money can be returned.  The disgrace of a flogging sticks to a boy or man, and, besides, as a  punishment is infinitely too severe for most of the offences for which it  is inflicted. It would be a cruel punishment were the judge infallible,  but with an erring human being for an irresponsible judge, the matter is  far worse. And that good seamen are deterred from entering the Royal Navy,  knowing that the commission of a peccadillo or two may bring down the cat  on their unlucky shoulders, is a matter of fact.    We shall meet the sailor on the sea many a time and again during the  progress of this work, and see how hardly he earns his scanty reward in  the midst of the awful dangers peculiar to the elements he dares.  Shakespeare says that he is--      \"A man whom both the waters and the wind,    In that vast tennis-court, hath made the ball    For them to play on\"--    that the men of all others who have made England what she is, have not  altogether a bed of roses even on a well-conducted vessel, whilst they may  lose their lives at any moment by shipwreck and sudden death. George  Herbert says--      \"Praise the sea, but keep on land.\"    And while the present writer would be sorry to prevent any healthy,  capable, adventurous boy from entering a noble profession, he recommends  him to first study the literature of the sea to the best and fullest of  his ability. Our succeeding chapter will exhibit some of the special  perils which surround the sailor's life, whilst it will exemplify to some  extent the qualities specially required and expected from him.

England, and indeed all Europe, long prior to 1870 had been busily  constructing ironclads, and the daily journals teemed with descriptions of  new forms and varieties of ships, armour, and armament, as well as of new  and enormous guns, which, rightly directed, might sink them to the bottom.  Among the more curious of the ironclads of that period, and the  construction of which had led to any quantity of discussion, sometimes of  a very angry kind, was the turret-ship--practically the sea-going  \"monitor\"--_Captain_, which Captain Cowper Phipps Coles had at length been  permitted to construct. Coles, who was an enthusiast of great scientific  attainments, as well as a practical seaman, which too many of our  experimentalists in this direction have not been, had distinguished  himself in the Crimea, and had later made many improvements in rendering  vessels shot-proof. His revolving turrets are, however, the inventions  with which his name are more intimately connected, although he had much to  do with the general construction of the _Captain_, and other ironclads of  the period.    The _Captain_ was a large double-screw armour-plated vessel, of 4,272  tons. Her armour in the most exposed parts was eight inches in thickness,  ranging elsewhere downwards from seven to as low as three inches. She had  two revolving turrets, the strongest and heaviest yet built, and carried  six powerful guns. Among the peculiarities of her construction were, that  she had only nine feet of \"free-board\"--_i.e._, that was the height of her  sides out of water. The forecastle and after-part of the vessel were  raised above this, and they were connected with a light hurricane-deck.  This, as we shall see, played an important part in the sad disaster we  have to relate.    On the morning of the 8th of September, 1870, English readers, at their  breakfast-tables, in railway carriages, and everywhere, were startled with  the news that the _Captain_ had foundered, with all hands, in the Bay of  Biscay. Six hundred men had been swept into eternity without a moment's  warning. She had been in company with the squadron the night before, and,  indeed, had been visited by the admiral, for purposes of inspection, the  previous afternoon. The early part of the evening had been fine; later it  had become what sailors call \"dirty weather;\" at midnight the wind rose  fast, and soon culminated in a furious gale. At 2.15 in the morning of the  7th a heavy bank of clouds passed off, and the stars came out clear and  bright, the moon then setting; but no vessel could be discerned where the  _Captain_ had been last observed. At daybreak the squadron was all in  sight, but scattered. \"_Only ten ships instead of eleven could be  discerned, the __'__Captain__'__ being the missing one._\" Later, it  appeared that seventeen of the men and the gunner had escaped, and landed  at Corbucion, north of Cape Finisterre, on the afternoon of the 7th. _All  the men who were saved belonged to the starboard watch_; or, in other  words, none escaped except those on deck duty. Every man below, whether  soundly sleeping after his day's work, or tossing sleeplessly in his  berth, thinking of home and friends and present peril, or watching the  engines, or feeding the furnaces, went down, without the faintest  possibility of escaping his doom.    Think of this catastrophe, and what it involved! The families and friends  of 600 men plunged into mourning, and the scores on scores of wives and  children into poverty! In _one_ street of Portsea, thirty wives were made  widows by the occurrence.(43) The shock of the news killed one poor woman,  then in weak health. Nor were the sad effects confined to the cottages of  the poor. The noble-hearted captain of the vessel was a son of  Field-Marshal Burgoyne; Captain Coles, her inventor; a son of Mr.  Childers, the then First Lord of the Admiralty; the younger son of Lord  Northbrook; the third son of Lord Herbert of Lea; and Lord Lewis Gordon,  brother of the Marquis of Huntley, were among the victims of that terrible  morning. The intelligence arrived during the excitement caused by the  defeat and capitulation of Sedan, which, involving, as it did, the  deposition of the Emperor and the fate of France, was naturally the great  topic of discussion, but for the time it overshadowed even those great  events, for it was a national calamity.    From the statements of survivors we now know that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#18)"],[1,"of skull is a case in point.  The difference in size is reflected in the weights. Average weights of  nine males and nine females from southern localities are, respectively,  14.7 (12-16.5) and 13.8 (12-15.5) instead of 18.5 (17-20) and 17.0  (15-18) grams for four males and six females from the northern  localities. In general, Tamaulipan specimens average somewhat smaller  than those from other localities in eastern Mexico (see measurements  given by Baker, 1956:238, Dalquest, 1953:107, and Osgood, 1900:53).         _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of six       specimens (2 males and 4 females) from Miquihuana, three       males from four miles north of Jaumave, and five (3 males       and 2 females) from nine miles southwest of Tula are,       respectively, as follows: 176.2 (163-185), ----, 170, 173,       (4 specimens only) 179.0 (165-186); 99.8 (97-105), ----, 90,       93, (4 specimens only) 96.7 (88-104); 22.5 (21-23), 23, 23,       24, 22.6 (22-23); 8 (8), 8, 8, 8, 8.8 (8-9); greatest length       of skull, 26.1 (25.6-26.6), 25.8, 26.5, 26.9, 25.2       (24.9-25.7); mastoid breadth, 13.3 (12.9-13.6), 13.2, 13.8,       13.6, 13.1 (12.9-13.4); interorbital constriction, 6.4       (6.1-6.6), 5.9, 6.3, 6.3, 6.3 (6.1-6.8); interparietal       breadth, 7.4 (6.8-7.9), 7.7, 7.2, 7.2, 7.6 (7.3-7.9);       alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.7 (3.5-4.0); 3.6,       3.5, 3.6, 3.6 (3.5-3.8).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 42:       Miquihuana, 6300 ft., 7; 4 mi.

The specimen examined from four miles north of Jaumave was trapped in a  xeric area in which the vegetation consisted of mesquite, high palmlike  yuccas, and \"lechugilla.\" Specimens from the vicinity of Tula were  trapped along bushy fence rows and adjacent to clumps of bushes and  cactus, or shot at night in an area in which the soil was a sandy loam  having relatively large amounts of gravel. The average weight of seven  specimens from Nicolas was 50.3 (42-60) grams.    According to Lidicker (1960:178 and in _litt._), the place called Lulu  that was ascribed to Tamaulipas by Setzer (1949:550), and from which  _D. o. durranti_ was reported, actually is in Zacatecas.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 19:       Miquihuana, 6200 ft., 2; 4 mi.

NW San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Mexican Plateau in western       part of state.    Specimens examined are tentatively assigned to _Dipodomys merriami  atronasus_. They differ from typical _atronasus_ as pointed out by  Lidicker (1960:177). He noted that individuals from the eastern edge of  the range of _D. m. atronasus_ were slightly paler than typical  specimens, but I found Tamaulipan material to be much darker,  especially behind the nose and ears (blackish instead of brownish),  than specimens from Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas.    Specimens examined were collected under the same conditions and in the  same areas as _D. ordii durranti_. The average weight of 20 adults (11  females and nine males) was 46.6 (38-50) grams.         _Records of occurrences._--Specimens examined, 27: Nicolas,       56 km. NW Tula, 5500 ft., 16; Tajada, 23 mi. NW Tula, 5200       ft., 4; 15 mi. N Tula, 1; 8 mi. N Tula, 4500 ft., 3; 9 mi.       SW Tula, 3900 ft., 3.         Additional record: Tula (Lidicker, 1960:178).      =Liomys irroratus=    Mexican Spiny Pocket Mouse    This species is probably the most common rodent in Tamaulipas. It was  taken at almost every locality sampled and was associated with many  other kinds of rodents. Its distribution is state-wide with the  exception of the extreme northwestern part. Two subspecies are  represented in Tamaulipas, _L. i. alleni_, which occurs in the western  side of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the southwest part of the state,  and _L. i. texensis_, which occupies the rest of the range of the  species in the state.    At Soto la Marina specimens were taken in dense brush, around the  cultivated fields; no burrows were seen and all specimens were trapped  before 10:00 p.m. On the Sierra de Tamaulipas, _Liomys_ was collected  in practically all microhabitats. In the vicinity of San Fernando,  individuals were trapped in a dry area in which vegetation consisted of  mesquite, cactus and chollas; the ground there was covered with dry  leaves and small sticks, and burrows were found near the base of the  mesquite bushes. One specimen was taken near the house of a woodrat.  Two kilometers west of El Carrizo, where _Liomys irroratus_ is called  \"raton tuza,\" specimens were collected on rocks inclined at an angle of  about twenty-five degrees that were covered with zacaton grass and  some bushes. Some individuals were taken in a sugar cane field that was  surrounded by bushes and tall grass; _Baiomys taylori_, _Sigmodon  hispidus_, and _Peromyscus leucopus_ were taken in the line of traps.  One specimen was caught in a trap baited with banana.    Some dates concerning reproduction of _Liomys irroratus_ in Tamaulipas  are as follows: La Pesca, May 25, one female lactating and one female  pregnant with 4 embryos that measured 8 mm.; Jaumave, July 26-29, three  females lactating and three pregnant females that carried 6 embryos (6  mm.), 6 embryos (15 mm.), and 5 embryos (15 mm.); Palmillas, July 23, a  female with 1 embryo measuring 6 mm.; Nicolas, October 19, a female  carrying 4 embryos measuring 3 mm.      =Liomys irroratus alleni= (Coues)         1881. _Heteromys alleni_ Coues, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.,       8:187, March, type from Rio Verde, San Luis Potosi.         1911. _Liomys irroratus alleni_, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna,       34:56, September 7.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Extreme southwestern part of       state.    This subspecies is easily distinguished from _L. i. texensis_ by the  following features: hind foot larger, 31.5 (30-33.5) instead of 27.8  (27-29); skull longer, 34.2 (32.4-36.4) instead of 31.5 (30.0-32.5);  maxillary tooth-row longer, 5.4 (5.0-5.8) instead of 5.0 (4.8-5.1);  interorbital constriction relatively narrower in _alleni_.  Intergradation between _L. i. alleni_ and _L. i. texensis_ takes place  at Rancho Santa Rosa (where, of the two specimens, one is conspicuously  larger than the other), eight kilometers northeast of Antiguo Morelos,  El Encino, and Ejido Santa Isabel. All specimens from the localities  mentioned are here assigned to _texensis_.    Weight of three pregnant females averaged 68.9 (64-78) grams, that of  non-pregnant females, 65.6 (64-68), and that of six males 73.0 (65-80).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 34: Villa       Mainero, 1700 ft., 2; Nicolas, 56 km. NW Tula, 5500 ft., 6;       Jaumave, 2400 ft., 23; 16 mi. N, 6 mi. W Palmillas, 5500       ft., 1; 14 mi. N, 6 mi. W Palmillas, 5500 ft., 2.

Fauna,       34:59, September 7.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--State-wide except extreme       southwestern and northwestern parts.    Intergradation occurs between _L. i. texensis_ and _L. i. pretiosus_ in  southeastern Tamaulipas as noted previously by Hooper (1953:5).  Individuals from Altamira and one mile south thereof are small and dark  as in _pretiosus_, but cranial measurements are as in _texensis_ to  which they are here assigned. Specimens from the vicinity of Tampico  are typical _texensis_.    Average weight of the specimens from three different localities are as  follows: Soto la Marina, seven males, 42.7, "]]]
