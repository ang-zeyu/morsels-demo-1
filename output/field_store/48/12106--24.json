A crowd of rough fellows sauntered by outside the  windows and filled the air with coarse jokes and snatches of ribald  song. Charity clenched her little hands that Tom had kissed under the  princess-pine and endured it all, with her eyes on the grimy face of  the clock, until the train backed into the station and bore her away.    At a little before midnight she reached her own home. While she stood  on the worn door-stone, her whole frame trembling from exhaustion and  the long agony of that evening, her eyes fell on Tom's footprints of  the night before. For one moment a hard look came into her face; then  she suddenly stooped, kissed the light snow as if it had been a cold,  dead face, and moaning, \"O Tom, Tom, how could you!\" with a sob like  that of a hurt child, turned and went in out of the night. And this  was her Christmas Eve.      IV    When Charity awoke next morning the sun was shining cheerfully in upon  the smooth yellow floor of her little room and its mats of braided  rags. The sky was of the bluest and the earth of the whitest; a flock  of sparrows were wishing each other Merry Christmas in the boughs of  an old appletree near by; the cattle in the barn, contentedly  ruminating over their morning allowance of hay, seemed rehearsing to  each other the old story of the manger and the wonderful night in  Palestine. As these pleasant sights and sounds stole in upon the  girl's senses, a happy smile broke upon her lips and she felt at peace  with the whole world. Then came, like a flash of red lightning out of  the sparkling blue sky, the memory of the preceding day. Her brain  reeled under the shock of returning recollection, as, one by one,  every kindly evasive word of her informants came back to her. But  Charity was a girl of quick impulses and decided action. In five  minutes she had made up her mind what to do. Half an hour later she  was standing behind grandmother's chair at Farmer Ralston's with white  face and set lips. The family, she found, were somewhat concerned  about Tom's absence, but they had not been in any real alarm, as he  might have changed his plans and remained in the city, leaving Charity  with her friends for the night. Now they crowded about her, all asking  questions at once, and growing momently more frightened at her  silence. She managed to tell them that Tom had not kept his  appointment--that she could learn nothing definite about him--that she  had guessed from what little information she had been able to obtain,  that he had been taken sick and carried to the hospital--or somewhere;  it was nothing serious, she was sure, and at any rate she was going up  to the city that morning on the train to find out all about it. Tom's  father was too old and feeble to undertake the trip, and his sister  had better not leave home that day--Christmas. She could do better  alone, as she knew the streets pretty well (here her voice failed her  a little), and besides, it would only worry Tom to see them all  coming. So she went as she wished to, alone.    Arriving in the city, she examined a directory in the nearest drug  store and copied off the numbers and localities of all the police  stations in the city proper. Then she found her way without much  trouble to the market and asked the tall, broad-shouldered policeman  on duty there for directions to the nearest station. He looked down  pityingly on the young girl, appealing to him with her white face and  eyes that betrayed her suffering on that glad Christmas morning.    \"Nothing serious, is it, miss? A fight, maybe, or something o' that  sort?\"    \"Oh, no, sir! I only want to see if--if--somebody\"--    The kind-hearted officer guessed her trouble immediately.    \"I see, I see,\" said he, softening his voice still more. \"He didn't  get home last night after he was paid off. Well, I guess you'll find  it all right; anyway, I hope you will. Take your first turn to the  left, and two blocks further you'll come to my station. Tell the  sergeant you saw Brown, and that I sent you to him for information.\"    Charity thanked him with a grateful look that was better than words,  and moved with rapid steps along the icy sidewalk in the direction  indicated. She was courteously received at the station, but no one  knew anything about Tom. Nor did they in the next station she visited,  nor in the third or fourth. It was now nearly noon, and people were  beginning to sit down to their Christmas dinners. The table at Farmer  Ralston's was always a jolly place, and at Christmas time the fun was  uproarious. Charity had been invited every year since she could  remember, and she gave a little gulp as she thought of the row of  bright, laughing faces that would have been gathered in the old  kitchen, still sweet with the resinous odors of the evergreen that had  lain there in piles in those last happy days that now seemed ages ago.  Wearily she mounted the granite steps of Station Five and repeated her  question. The lieutenant, a brisk, wiry man, with a heavy gray  moustache and little, piercing eyes, cast a quick glance at her and  consulted his book. Presently he gave a little nod, and raising his  voice, called out, \"Norcross, here a minute!\"    A uniformed officer in an adjoining room opened himself like a kind of  long jack-knife, rose from the bench where he had been reclining and  stood at the walnut rail in front of his superior, awaiting orders.  The lieutenant took a key from the rack at his side and handed it to  Norcross.    \"This lady wants to see No. 3. Show her down.\"    The officer bowed respectfully and led the way down a flight of stone  steps into what at first appeared to be a sort of cellar, with grated  windows near the ceiling on one side and a row of iron-barred doors on  the other.    \"There,\" said the officer, pointing.    Charity paused a moment and pressed her hand against her heart; for a  moment she could not have spoken, it beat so fiercely. Then she  advanced across the brick floor, and standing by the door of Cell No.  3, looked in through the bars.    At first she could see nothing, but, as her eyes became accustomed to  the dim light, she could distinguish at one side a narrow iron bed,  and lying motionless upon it, his head buried in his arms, a crumpled,  stained, wretched figure--yes, Tom!    The rustle of the girl's dress fell upon his ear. He raised his head  slightly, recognized the sound, turned away again without looking her  in the face, and shook with such a tempest of sobs that Charity  trembled and could not speak the grave, deliberate words she had  prepared on the way.        \"Landlord, fill the flowing bowl!\"    sang some poor creature shrilly, two or three doors away. How Charity  remembered all these things afterward! While the officer stepped aside  to quiet the noisy prisoner she forced herself at last to speak.    \"Mr. Ralston\"--Tom started, and she saw his grasp tighten on the iron  rail of the bed, \"I have come to take you away from this place. I  shall send for the bail commissioner at once\" (she had learned her  lesson well, poor child!), \"so that you can catch the two o'clock  train. No!\" she went on quickly, checking him with a gesture as he was  about to speak, \"you mustn't stay here another night, nor another  hour. It would kill your father if he knew it, and we couldn't answer  his questions to-night.\"    The strong man bowed his head again, without a word. She hesitated an  instant, then left him, and walked across the floor and up the stone  stairway with a firm step. Tom looked after her wistfully, but she did  not even glance toward his cell. Within half an hour he was sent for,  and found Charity, with the commissioner and the sergeant, sitting  behind the rail, in the room above. The bail was quickly arranged, the  officer handed over a jack-knife and a few coppers he had taken from  Tom's pockets the night before, and told him he could go where he  pleased until nine o'clock the next morning, when the court opened.    There was a constrained silence for a moment in the little office. At  last Tom raised his eyes, with a look in them half questioning, half  appealing, to the girl's white face, at the same time involuntarily  extending his hand toward her. For the first time in his life he found  no response in the brown eyes, staring stonily out of the barred  windows.    His hand slowly dropped to his side. With a dazed look he turned first  to the officers, then to Charity, as if he did not understand. Still  there was no response in the brown eyes, staring stonily out of the  barred windows. Still Tom stood there helplessly, not quite  understanding it all. Glancing at his stained and rumpled clothes he  brushed them a little, mechanically, passed his hand over his forehead  once or twice, then turned humbly toward the door, passed out  bareheaded and was gone.    How Charity found her way home she never knew. When she entered her  own little chamber at dusk and buried her aching head in her pillow,  she had a vague recollection of wandering about the gay city streets  for hours, of finally seeking the railroad station, of cooling her hot  forehead against the frosty pane of the car, and watching the  snowflakes that came faster and faster from the darkening sky. Tom had  come home, the station-master had told her carelessly, and that was  all she cared to know.    How he endured the ignominy of appearing and paying his fine in the  municipal court the next day, she did not ask; nor did she even see  him for a week. After the excitement of that gloomy Christmas came,  with the reaction, a complete nervous exhaustion, which mercifully  spared her the torture of questioning eyes and tongues until beyond  New Year's--that should have been her wedding-day.    Meanwhile she wavered irresolutely between one and another course of  action. Now she felt she must cry out to him to forgive her own cruel  hardness in his time of trouble; now the Puritan blood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#18)"],[1," disappoint all  robbers for the future, he supplied its place with an earthen lamp, of  which he very peacefully kept possession ever after.    Among the ancients, the heroes in philosophy, as well as those in war  and patriotism, have a grandeur and force of sentiment, which  astonishes our narrow souls, and is rashly rejected as extravagant and  supernatural. They, in their turn, I allow, would have had equal  reason to consider as romantic and incredible, the degree of humanity,  clemency, order, tranquillity, and other social virtues, to which, in  the administration of government, we have attained in modern times, had  any one been then able to have made a fair representation of them. Such  is the compensation, which nature, or rather education, has made in the  distribution of excellencies and virtues, in those different ages.    The merit of benevolence, arising from its utility, and its tendency  to promote the good of mankind has been already explained, and is, no  doubt, the source of a CONSIDERABLE part of that esteem, which is so  universally paid to it. But it will also be allowed, that the very  softness and tenderness of the sentiment, its engaging endearments, its  fond expressions, its delicate attentions, and all that flow of mutual  confidence and regard, which enters into a warm attachment of love  and friendship: it will be allowed, I say, that these feelings,  being delightful in themselves, are necessarily communicated to the  spectators, and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy. The tear  naturally starts in our eye on the apprehension of a warm sentiment of  this nature: our breast heaves, our heart is agitated, and every humane  tender principle of our frame is set in motion, and gives us the purest  and most satisfactory enjoyment.    When poets form descriptions of Elysian fields, where the blessed  inhabitants stand in no need of each other's assistance, they yet  represent them as maintaining a constant intercourse of love and  friendship, and sooth our fancy with the pleasing image of these soft  and gentle passions. The idea of tender tranquillity in a pastoral  Arcadia is agreeable from a like principle, as has been observed above.  [Footnote: Sect. v. Part 2.]    Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and scolding, and mutual  reproaches? The roughness and harshness of these emotions disturb and  displease us: we suffer by contagion and sympathy; nor can we remain  indifferent spectators, even though certain that no pernicious  consequences would ever follow from such angry passions.    As a certain proof that the whole merit of benevolence is not derived  from its usefulness, we may observe, that in a kind way of blame, we  say, a person is TOO GOOD; when he exceeds his part in society, and  carries his attention for others beyond the proper bounds. In  like manner, we say, a man is too HIGH-SPIRITED, TOO INTREPID, TOO  INDIFFERENT ABOUT FORTUNE: reproaches, which really, at bottom, imply  more esteem than many panegyrics. Being accustomed to rate the merit and  demerit of characters chiefly by their useful or pernicious tendencies,  we cannot forbear applying the epithet of blame, when we discover a  sentiment, which rises to a degree, that is hurtful; but it may happen,  at the same time, that its noble elevation, or its engaging tenderness  so seizes the heart, as rather to increase our friendship and concern  for the person.           [Footnote: Cheerfulness could scarce admit of blame from its  excess, were it not that dissolute mirth, without a proper cause or  subject, is a sure symptom and characteristic of folly, and on that  account disgustful.]    The amours and attachments of Harry the IVth of France, during the civil  wars of the league, frequently hurt his interest and his cause; but all  the young, at least, and amorous, who can sympathize with the tender  passions, will allow that this very weakness, for they will readily call  it such, chiefly endears that hero, and interests them in his fortunes.    The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of Charles the XIIth  ruined his own country, and infested all his neighbours; but have  such splendour and greatness in their appearance, as strikes us with  admiration; and they might, in some degree, be even approved of, if they  betrayed not sometimes too evident symptoms of madness and disorder.    The Athenians pretended to the first invention of agriculture and of  laws: and always valued themselves extremely on the benefit thereby  procured to the whole race of mankind. They also boasted, and with  reason, of their war like enterprises; particularly against those  innumerable fleets and armies of Persians, which invaded Greece during  the reigns of Darius and Xerxes. But though there be no comparison in  point of utility, between these peaceful and military honours; yet we  find, that the orators, who have writ such elaborate panegyrics on  that famous city, have chiefly triumphed in displaying the warlike  achievements. Lysias, Thucydides, Plato, and Isocrates discover, all of  them, the same partiality; which, though condemned by calm reason and  reflection, appears so natural in the mind of man.    It is observable, that the great charm of poetry consists in lively  pictures of the sublime passions, magnanimity, courage, disdain of  fortune; or those of the tender affections, love and friendship; which  warm the heart, and diffuse over it similar sentiments and emotions. And  though all kinds of passion, even the most disagreeable, such as  grief and anger, are observed, when excited by poetry, to convey a  satisfaction, from a mechanism of nature, not easy to be explained: Yet  those more elevated or softer affections have a peculiar influence, and  please from more than one cause or principle. Not to mention that  they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represented, or  communicate any esteem and affection for their character.    And can it possibly be doubted, that this talent itself of poets, to  move the passions, this pathetic and sublime of sentiment, is a very  considerable merit; and being enhanced by its extreme rarity, may exalt  the person possessed of it, above every character of the age in which  he lives? The prudence, address, steadiness, and benign government of  Augustus, adorned with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial  crown, render him but an unequal competitor for fame with Virgil, who  lays nothing into the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his  poetical genius.    The very sensibility to these beauties, or a delicacy of taste, is  itself a beauty in any character; as conveying the purest, the most  durable, and most innocent of all enjoyments.    These are some instances of the several species of merit, that are  valued for the immediate pleasure which they communicate to the  person possessed of them. No views of utility or of future beneficial  consequences enter into this sentiment of approbation; yet is it of  a kind similar to that other sentiment, which arises from views of a  public or private utility. The same social sympathy, we may observe, or  fellow-feeling with human happiness or misery, gives rise to both; and  this analogy, in all the parts of the present theory, may justly be  regarded as a confirmation of it.        SECTION VIII.    OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OTHERS.               [Footnote: It is the nature and, indeed, the definition of  virtue, that it is A QUALITY OF THE MIND AGREEABLE TO OR APPROVED OF BY  EVERY ONE WHO CONSIDERS OR CONTEMPLATES IT. But some qualities produce  pleasure, because they are useful to society, or useful or agreeable  to the person himself; others produce it more immediately, which is the  case with the class of virtues here considered.]    AS the mutual shocks, in SOCIETY, and the oppositions of interest and  self-love have constrained mankind to establish the laws of JUSTICE, in  order to preserve the advantages of mutual assistance and protection: in  like manner, the eternal contrarieties, in COMPANY, of men's pride and  self-conceit, have introduced the rules of Good Manners or Politeness,  in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds, and an undisturbed  commerce and conversation. Among well-bred people, a mutual deference is  affected; contempt of others disguised; authority concealed; attention  given to each in his turn; and an easy stream of conversation  maintained, without vehemence, without interruption, without eagerness  for victory, and without any airs of superiority. These attentions  and regards are immediately AGREEABLE to others, abstracted from any  consideration of utility or beneficial tendencies: they conciliate  affection, promote esteem, and extremely enhance the merit of the person  who regulates his behaviour by them.    Many of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and casual; but the thing  expressed by them is still the same. A Spaniard goes out of his own  house before his guest, to signify that he leaves him master of all.  In other countries, the landlord walks out last, as a common mark of  deference and regard.    But, in order to render a man perfect GOOD COMPANY, he must have Wit and  Ingenuity as well as good manners. What wit is, it may not be easy  to define; but it is easy surely to determine that it is a quality  immediately AGREEABLE to others, and communicating, on its first  appearance, a lively joy and satisfaction to every one who has any  comprehension of it. The most profound metaphysics, indeed, might be  employed in explaining the various kinds and species of wit; and many  classes of it, which are now received on the sole testimony of taste and  sentiment, might, perhaps, be resolved into more general principles. But  this is sufficient for our present purpose, that it does affect taste  and sentiment, and bestowing an immediate enjoyment, is a sure source of  approbation and affection.
