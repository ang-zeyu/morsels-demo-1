All that can be drawn  from the contrast \"instead of following my instructions they offer  sacrifice\" (for that is the meaning of the passage) is that the prophet  had never once dreamed of the possibility of cultus being made  the subject of Jehovah's directions.  In Isaiah's discourses  the well-known passage of the first chapter belongs to this connection:  \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?  saith the Lord. I am weary with the burnt-offerings of rams  and the fat of fed beasts, and I delight not in the blood of bullocks  and of lambs and of he-goats.  When ye come to look upon my face,  who hath required this at your hands?--to trample my courts!\"  This expression has long been a source of trouble, and certainly  the prophet could not possibly have uttered it if the sacrificial  worship had, according to any tradition whatever, passed for being  specifically Mosaic.  Isaiah uses the word Torah to denote not  the priestly but the prophetical instruction (i.10, ii.3, v.24,  viii.16, 20, xxx.9); as both have a common source and Jehovah is  the proper instructor (xxx.20), this is easily explicable, and is  moreover full of instruction as regards the idea involved;  the contents of the Priestly Code fit badly in with the Torah of i.10.  Lastly, Micah's answer to the people's question, how a return of  the favour of an angry God is to be secured, is of conspicuous  significance (vi.6 seq.):  \"Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings with calves of a year old?  Is the Lord pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of  rivers of oil?  Shall I give my first-born for my transgression,  the fruit of my body as atonement for my soul?--It hath been  told thee, O man, what is good, and what Jehovah requireth of thee.  Nay, it is to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly  before thy God.\"  Although the blunt statement of the contrast between cultus  and religion is peculiarly prophetic, Micah can still take  his stand upon this, \"It hath been told thee, O man, what Jehovah  requires.\"  It is no new matter, but a thing well known,  that sacrifices are not what the Torah of the Lord contains.    That we have not inferred too much from these utterances of the  older prophets is clear from the way in which they are taken up  and carried on by Jeremiah, who lived shortly before the  Babylonian exile.  Just as in vi.19 seq. he opposes the Torah to  the cultus, so in vii.11 seq. he thus expresses himself:  \"Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh!  For I said nought unto your fathers, and commanded them nought,  in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning  burnt-offerings or sacrifices.  But this thing commanded I them:  hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my  people, and walk ye in the way that I shall always teach you, that  it may be well with you.\"  The view indeed, that the prophets (who, from the connection,  are the ever-living voice to which Israel is to hearken) are  the proper soul of the theocracy, the organ by which Jehovah  influences and rules it, has no claim to immemorial antiquity.  But no stress lies upon the positive element here;  enough that at all events Jeremiah is unacquainted with the Mosaic  legislation as it is contained in the Priestly Code.  His ignoring  of it is not intentional, for he is far from hating the cultus  (xvii.26).  But, as priest and prophet, staying continually in  the temple at Jerusalem, he must have known it, if it had existed  and actually been codified.  The fact is one which it is difficult  to get over.    Thus the historical witnesses, particularly the prophets, decide  the matter in favour of the Jehovistic tradition.  According to the  universal opinion of the pre-exilic period, the cultus is indeed of  very old and (to the people) very sacred usage, but not a Mosaic  institution; the ritual is not the main thing in it, and is in no  sense the subject with which the Torah deals. /1/    *********************************  1. That the priests were not mere teachers of law and morals,  but also gave ritual instruction (e.g, regarding cleanness  and uncleanness), is of course not denied by this.  All that is  asserted is that in pre-exilian antiquity the priests' own praxis  (at the altar) never constituted the contents of the Torah,  but that their Torah always consisted of instructions to the laity.  The distinction is easily intelligible to those who choose  to understand it.  ********************************    In other words, no trace can be found of acquaintance  with the Priestly Code, but, on the other hand, very clear  indications of ignorance of its contents.    II.I.3. In this matter the transition from the pre-exilic to the  post-exilic period is effected, not by Deuteronomy, but by  Ezekiel the priest in prophet's mantle, who was one of the first to  be carried into exile.  He stands in striking contrast with his  elder contemporary Jeremiah.  In the picture of Israel's future  which he drew in B.C. 573 (chaps. xl.-xlviii.), in which  fantastic hopes are indeed built upon Jehovah, but no impossible  demand made of man, the temple and cultus hold a central place.  Whence this sudden change?  Perhaps because now the Priestly Code  has suddenly awakened to life after its long trance, and become  the inspiration of Ezekiel?  The explanation is certainly not to  be sought in any such occurrence, but simply in the historical  circumstances.  So long as the sacrificial worship remained in  actual use, it was zealously carried on, but people did not  concern themselves with it theoretically, and had not the least  occasion for reducing it to a code.  But once the temple was in  ruins, the cultus at an end, its PERSONNEL out of employment, it is  easy to understand how the sacred praxis should have become a  matter of theory and writing, so that it might not altogether  perish, and how an exiled priest should have begun to paint the  picture of it as he carried it in his memory, and to publish it as  a programme for the future restoration of the theocracy.  Nor is  there any difficulty if arrangements, which as long as they  were actually in force were simply regarded as natural, were seen  after their abolition in a transfiguring light, and from the study  devoted to them gained artificially a still higher value.  These  historical conditions supplied by the exile sufffice to make clear  the transition from Jeremiah to Ezekiel, and the genesis of Ezekiel  xl.-xlviii.  The co-operation of the Priestly Code is here not  merely unnecessary, it would be absolutely disconcerting.  Ezekiel's departure from the ritual of the Pentateuch cannot be  explained as intentional alterations of the original; they are  too casual and insignificant.  The prophet, moreover, has the  rights of authorship as regards the end of his book as well as for  the rest of it; he has also his right to his picture of the future  as the earlier prophets had to theirs.  And finally, let its due  weight be given to the simple fact that an exiled priest saw  occasion to draft such a sketch of the temple worship.  What need  would there have been for it, if the realised picture,  corresponding completely to his views, had actually existed, and,  being already written in a book, wholly obviated any danger lest  the cultus should become extinct through the mere fact of its  temporary cessation?    Here again a way of escape is open by assuming a lifeless  existence of the law down to Ezra's time.  But if this is done it  is unallowable to date that existence, not from Moses, but from  some other intermediate point in the history of Israel.  Moreover,  the assumption of a codification either as preceding all praxis,  or as alongside and independent of it, is precisely in the case of  sacrificial ritual one of enormous difficulty, for it is obvious  that such a codification can only be the final result of an old  and highly developed use, and not the invention of an idle brain.  This consideration also makes retreat into the theory of an  illegal praxis impossible, and renders the legitimacy of the  actually subsisting indisputable.        II.II.    At all times, then, the sacrificial worship of Israel existed, and  had great importance attached to it, but in the earlier period it  rested upon custom, inherited from the fathers, in the post-exilian  on the law of Jehovah, given through Moses.  At first it was naive,  and what was chiefly considered was the quantity and quality of  the gifts; afterwards it became legal,--the scrupulous fulfilment  of the law, that is, of the prescribed ritual, was what was looked  to before everything.  Was there then, apart from this, strictly  speaking, no material difference?  To answer this question our  researches must be carried further afield, after some preliminary  observations have been made in order to fix our position.    II.II.1. In the Pentateuch the sacrificial ritual is indeed copiously  described, but nowhere in the Old Testament is its significance  formally explained; this is treated as on the whole self-evident  and familiar to every one.  The general notion of a sacrifice is  in the Priestly Code that of _qorban_, in the rest of the Old  Testament that of _minha_, /1/ ie., \"gift;\"    ***************************************  1. Genesis iv. 3-5, Numbers xvi. 15; 1Samuel ii. 17, 29, xxvi. 19;  Isaiah i. 13; Malachi i. 10-13, ii. 12, 13, iii. 3, 4.  In the Priestly Code _minha_ is exclusively a terminus technicus  for the meal-offering.  The general name in the LXX and in the  New Testament is DWRON (Matthew v. 23-24, viii. 4, xv. 5,  xxiii. 18, 19).  Compare Spencer, \"De ratione et origine  sacrificiorum\" (De Legibus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47333"],[0,"Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers (#18)"],[1,"none the less a church. Four bare walls, a wooden  cross upon a table, windows so covered with dust that they scarcely  let the light in,--all these things speak to the soul of meditation  and of prayer.    I do not know what the population of St. Jean Brévelay was. It could  not have been over two hundred; but on Sunday the people came to  High Mass from the four corners of the parish, which was vast and  populous. The farmhouses and thatched cottages all emptied themselves  at the first glow of dawn. You could see the families making their  way to the borough along every known road--the men leading the way  in silence, the women following in noisy talk among themselves. They  at first scattered through the graveyard, every family stopping to  say a prayer at the family tomb. Then the friends and relatives  came together in groups, and the men made more than one escape to  the tavern. At the last call for High Mass they all rushed to the  church doors, pushing, jostling, crowding one another, until the  building was filled from end to end. The graveyard--I might say the  borough--was now a perfect desert. The men, standing, and pressed  close together, occupied all the front part of the nave; the women,  kneeling, filled the rear. All, without exception, took part in the  singing. The common serpent was unknown to us; but with our voices  alone we managed to make a formidable noise. The people were happy to  be there, not because, as Voltaire says, \"High Mass is the opera of  the poor,\" but because, as the Christian Church says, religion is the  consolation of the afflicted. The rector delivered his sermons in Low  Breton, and they were never anything but a paraphrase of this word  of the Gospel, Love one another. And surely they loved one another,  those uncultured folk. They did not know how to read, but they knew  how to love. They understood gratitude too. My mother was almost an  object of worship.    The great festival of the year, after that of Saint Louis, was  Christmas. The King first and God next, such is the order of  precedence under all governments. It is possible that our poor  peasants would have reversed that order had they been able to do so.    I must say, in order not to give them more praise than they deserve,  that what they liked best about Christmas was the midnight Mass,--a  sorry enjoyment for you city-bred people, who are fond of your  comforts. But what is a sleepless night to a peasant? Even when they  had to plod along through the mud or the snow, not an old man, not a  woman hesitated. Umbrellas were then unknown at St. Jean Brévelay, or  at least ours was the only one that had ever been seen there, and it  was naturally the object of much surprise and admiration.    The women caught up their skirts with pins, threw a plaid kerchief  over their head-dresses, and started out bravely for the parish  church in their wooden shoes. Sleep, forsooth! Who could have slept  even had he wanted to? The chimes began the night before immediately  after the evening Angelus, and were repeated every half-hour until  midnight. The hunters, in order to contribute to the general  beatitude, kept up a steady firing. My father furnished the powder.  It was a universal and deafening clamor. The small boys took part in  it too, at the risk of maiming themselves, whenever they could lay  their hands on a gun or a pistol.    The vicarage was a short half-league from the borough. The rector  came over on his nag, which the _quinquiss_ (the beadle) led by  the bridle. A dozen peasants escorted him, firing their pistols  in his ears all the while. But this did not disturb him in the  least, for he was an old Chouan with the death of many a Blue on his  conscience,--withal, the kindest and most compassionate of men since  the king had returned and he had become a priest.    On that night great preparations were made at home. Telin-Charles  and Le Halloco measured the fireplace and the kitchen door with as  much earnestness and importance as though they had not known their  dimensions by heart for many years. The question was to bring in the  Yule log and to have it as large as possible.    A great tree was felled for the purpose; four oxen were harnessed;  and the log was dragged to the house. It took eight or ten men to  lift it, and to carry it in. It would scarcely fit in the fireplace.  Then it was adorned with garlands; it was propped and stayed by  the trunks of young trees; and an enormous bunch of wild-flowers,  or rather of live plants, was placed on top of it. The long table  was removed from the kitchen. We took our light meal standing. The  walls were hung with white table-cloths and sheets, just as they  are at Corpus Christi; and upon them were pinned numerous drawings  done by my sister Louise and my sister Hermine,--the Virgin, the  Christ-Child, etc. There were inscriptions too, \"Et homo factus  est!\" All the chairs were removed to make as much room as possible  for our visitors, who were not accustomed to sitting on anything  better than their heels. One chair was left for my mother and one for  my Aunt Gabrielle, who was treated with much deference on account of  her eighty-six years.    She was the one, my children, for stories of the Terror! Everybody  around me knew many such stories, for that matter,--my father  particularly, if he had only chosen to speak. He had been a Blue; and  his obstinate silence was no doubt due to prudence in a part of the  country that was so full of Chouans.    The confusion was such in the kitchen, with everybody wanting to be  useful, to carry in branches of fir, of broom, and of holly; the  noise was so deafening on account of the hammering of nails and the  rattling of pots and kettles; and then there came such a clamor from  without,--ringing of bells, firing of guns, songs, conversations,  and clatter of wooden shoes,--that it seemed like the din of a fair  at the very climax of its animation. At half-past eleven the cry,  \"Eutru Person! Eutru Person!\" (\"The rector! The rector!\") resounded  all along the street. It was taken up in the kitchen, and all the men  started out immediately. The women alone remained with the family.  When the rector reached our door, there was a moment of profound  silence. He dismounted. It was I who had the honor of holding his nag  by the bridle; that is, I was supposed to do so, but somebody else  always did it for me. Heaven knows there was no need of holding the  poor beast anyway.    M. Moizan walked up three steps to the landing, turned toward the  crowd that stood below him, hat in hand, removed his own hat, and  said, after making the sign of the cross, \"_Angelus Domini_ nuntiavit  Mariæ.\" A thousand voices responded.    When the prayer was over, he entered the house, spoke cordially to  my father and mother, to M. Ozon, the mayor, who had just arrived  from Pénic-Pichon, and to M. Oillo, the blacksmith, who was also the  justice's clerk. Then he proceeded to the benediction of the Yule log.    My father and mother stood on the left-hand side of the hearth. Those  women whom their importance or their intimate terms with the family  permitted to remain in the sanctuary, which in this case means the  kitchen, knelt in a semi-circle around the hearth. The men were  crowded together in the hall, the door of which was left open, and  they overflowed into the street as far as the graveyard. Every now  and then a woman who had been detained by some domestic care cleft  the crowd and came forward to where the others were kneeling.    Aunt Gabrielle, arrayed in her mantle, which always bespoke a solemn  occasion, knelt in the middle of the semi-circle, directly in front  of the Yule log, with a holy-water basin and a branch of box beside  her. She started a hymn which all the assistants repeated in chorus.    I have forgotten the words of that hymn, and I really regret it. The  air was monotonous and plaintive, like all those that were sung at  our firesides. However, it contained a crescendo at the moment of the  benediction which generally sent a shiver through me, producing what  is commonly known as goose-flesh.    Aunt Gabrielle had just reached that part of the hymn on the 25th  of December, 1822, when I became aware of a strange confusion  among the male voices outside. The women either stopped singing  entirely, or sang out of time and tune; the voices chased after  one another, scarcely sustained themselves, and seemed stifled by  a sudden emotion. My mother's hand, which held mine, trembled for  a moment, then grew firm by a great effort of her will. Her voice  rose, soared above the voices of the others, who, realizing at once  that they had wandered inopportunely, hurried back to the fold, and  so the hymn ended in good order after this surprising interruption.  What had happened? Something very simple indeed. A young woman  had made her way through the crowd, had entered the kitchen, and  apparently anxious to remain unnoticed, had fallen on her knees at a  little distance from the others, and buried her face in her hands.  I recognized her at once. It was Marion, my favorite, the best  seamstress on the place, and the prettiest girl in the borough. I  would surely have run forward to kiss her but for the solemnity of  the occasion, which forbade my leaving my place or making a noise.  She was weeping bitterly. Why are you weeping, my sweet Marion? I was  wild to have the ceremony end, that I might find out from her. All  the other girls seemed embarrassed. My mother alone, whom I looked  full in the face, appeared calm; but her face lied,--I knew it by the  trembling of her hand.    After the benediction of the Yule log it was the custom for all the  women present to kiss my mother before proceeding to the church.  They came up in good order, one after another; and in spite of their  number, which amounted to some thirty or forty, this formality only  required a few minutes. I think that my mother yielded"]]]
