Do so, and go home, we advise you.\" Really the members had done  the best they could, and worse things were in store for them. For when  the session was resumed the knights of the shire showed some resentment  that they had been allowed to outdo the burgesses in liberality. They  proposed that as they had agreed to pay a shilling in the pound on land  assessed over £50 in the third year, so a like payment should be made in  the fourth year on all goods over the value of £50. There was a stormy  debate on this motion; but Sir Thomas More at length made peace, and it  was passed. Thus Wolsey, on the whole, had contrived to obtain something  resembling his original proposal, but the payments were spread over a  period of four years. After this Wolsey, at the prorogation of  Parliament, could afford to thank the Commons on the king's behalf, and  assure them that \"his Grace would in such wise employ their loving  contribution as should be for the defence of his realm and of his  subjects, and the persecution and pressing of his enemy.\"    Yet, however Wolsey might rejoice in his success, he knew that he had  received a serious warning, which he was bound to lay to heart. He had  been faithful to the king, and had done his best to carry out his views.  The war with France was none of his advising, and he had no hopes of any  advantage from it; yet he was willing to take all the blame of measures  which inwardly he disapproved. He stood forward and assumed the  unpopularity of taxation, whose necessity he deplored. Henry spent the  nation's money at his pleasure, and Wolsey undertook the ungrateful task  of squeezing supplies from a reluctant Parliament, while the king sat a  benevolent spectator in the background. Henry took all the glory, and  left Wolsey to do all the unpleasant work. Wolsey stood between the  national temper and the king; he felt that he could not stand under the  odium of accomplishing many more such reconciliations. England had  reached the limit of its aspirations after national glory. For the  future Wolsey must maintain the king's honour without appealing to the  national pocket.    There was no prospect of obtaining further supplies from Parliament, and  the best way to pay the expenses of a futile war was by making a  lucrative peace. Wolsey tried to induce Francis I. to renew his  financial agreement with Henry VIII. which the war had broken off; and  to bring pressure to bear upon him for this purpose, was willing to  continue with Charles V. negotiations for a fresh undertaking.    So in June the unwearied Pace was sent to Bourbon's camp to promise  England's help on terms which Wolsey knew were sure to be refused.  England would again join in a campaign against France in the north,  provided Bourbon, by an invasion of Provence, succeeded in raising a  rebellion against Francis I., and would take an oath of allegiance to  the English king as lord of France. Bourbon sorely needed money, and did  all he could to win over Pace. He secretly took an oath of fidelity, not  of allegiance; and Pace was impressed with admiration of his genius and  believed in his chances of success. Wolsey was coldly cautious towards  Pace's enthusiasm, and the result was a breach between them. Pace openly  blamed Wolsey, as Wingfield had done before, and pressed for money and  an armed demonstration. Wolsey soberly rebuked his lack of judgment by  setting before him a well-considered survey of the political chances.  His caution proved to be justified, as Bourbon's invasion of Provence  was a failure. Wolsey gained all that he needed by his pretence of  helping Bourbon; he induced the French Court to undertake negotiations  seriously by means of secret envoys who were sent to London.    Still Wolsey did not hide from himself the difficulties in the way of an  alliance with France which would satisfy Henry VIII. or bring  substantial advantage to the country. However, on one point he managed  to obtain an immediate advantage. He always kept his eye on Scotland,  and now used the first signs of returning friendliness on the part of  France to further his scheme of restoring English influence in that  country. In June the Duke of Albany was recalled to France, and Wolsey  set to work to win back Queen Margaret to her brother's cause. He seems  to have despaired of blandishments, and contrived a way to have a more  powerful weapon. Margaret's husband, the Earl of Angus, had been sent by  Albany to France, where he was carefully guarded. On the first signs of  renewed friendliness between England and France a hint from Wolsey  procured him an opportunity of escaping to England. With Angus at his  disposal Wolsey urged Margaret to be reconciled to her husband, and  terrified her by the prospect of alternately restoring him to Scotland.  By playing cleverly on her personal feelings, Wolsey led her by degrees  to accept his own plan for freeing Scotland from Albany and French  interference. He urged that the young king was now old enough to rule  for himself, and promised Margaret help to secure her supremacy in his  council. At the same time he won over the Scottish lords by the prospect  of a marriage between James and Mary of England, who was still Henry  VIII.'s heir. In August James V. was set up as king, and the Scottish  Parliament approved of the English marriage. Again Wolsey won a signal  triumph, and accomplished by diplomacy what the sword had been unable to  achieve.    We need not follow the complicated diplomacy of the year 1524, which was  transferred to Italy, whither Francis I. had pursued Bourbon and was  engaged in the siege of Pavia. It is enough to say that Wolsey pursued a  cautious course: if Francis won the day in Italy he was ready to treat  with him liberally: if the imperial arms prevailed, then he could sell  England's alliance more dearly. But this cautious attitude was  displeasing to Charles, whose ambassador in London, De Praet, complained  without ceasing of the growing coldness of Henry and Wolsey. Wolsey kept  a sharp watch on De Praet, and resented his keen-sightedness; finally,  in February 1525, De Praet's despatches were intercepted, and he was  called before the Council, when Wolsey charged him with untruth. De  Praet answered by complaining that his privileges as an ambassador had  been violated. He was ordered to confine himself to his own house till  the king had written to the Emperor about his conduct.    This was indeed an unheard-of treatment for the ambassador of an ally,  and we can scarcely attribute it merely to personal spite on the part of  so skilled a statesman as Wolsey. Perhaps it was a deliberate plan to  cause a personal breach between Henry and the Emperor. No doubt Henry's  own feelings were towards Charles rather than Francis, and it seems  probable that Wolsey wished to show his master that Charles was only  trying to make use of his friendship for his own purposes. The  despatches of Charles's envoy were opened and their contents made known  to Henry for some time before Wolsey took any open action. He acted when  he saw his master sufficiently irritated, and he probably suggested that  the best way to give Charles a lesson was by an attack upon his  ambassador. This proposal agreed with the high-handed manner of action  which Henry loved to adopt. It gave him a chance of asserting his own  conception of his dignity, and he challenged Charles to say if he  identified himself with his ambassador's sentiments.    Under any circumstances it was an audacious step, and as things turned  out it was an unfortunate one. Within a few days the news reached  England that Francis had been attacked at Pavia by the imperial forces,  had been entirely routed, and was a prisoner in the hands of Charles.  Though Wolsey was prepared for some success of the imperial arms, he was  taken aback at the decisiveness of the stroke. His time for widening the  breach between Charles and Henry had not been well chosen.    However, Charles saw that he could not pursue his victory without money,  and to obtain money he must adopt an appearance of moderation. So he  professed in Italy willingness to forget the past, and he avoided a  quarrel with England. He treated the insult to his ambassador as the  result of a personal misunderstanding. Henry complained of De Praet's  unfriendly bearing; Charles assured him that no offence was intended.  Both parties saved their dignity; De Praet was recalled, and another  ambassador was sent in his stead. Wolsey saw that he had been  precipitate, and hastened to withdraw his false step; Henry lent him his  countenance, but can scarcely have relished doing so. Wolsey knew that  his difficulties were increased. The victory of Charles again drew Henry  to his side and revived his projects of conquest at the expense of  France, now left helpless by its king's captivity. As the defection of  Bourbon had formerly awakened Henry's hopes, so now did the captivity of  Francis. Again Wolsey's pacific plans were shattered; again he was  driven to undertake the preparations for a war of which his judgment  disapproved.    Indeed Wolsey knew that war was absolutely impossible for want of money;  but it was useless to say so to the king. He was bound to try and raise  supplies by some means or other, and his experience of the last  Parliament had shown him that there was no more to be obtained from that  source. In his extremity Wolsey undertook the responsibility of reviving  a feudal obligation which had long been forgotten. He announced that the  king purposed to pass the sea in person, and demanded that the goodwill  of his subjects should provide for his proper equipment. But the  goodwill of the people was not allowed the privilege of spontaneous  generosity. Commissioners were appointed in every shire to assess men's  property, and require a sixth part of it for the king's needs. Wolsey  himself addressed the citizens of London. When they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#18)"],[1,"\" said Virginia, blushing.    \"How come she recommembered, Marse Comyn? Dat's de quality. Dat's why.  Doan't you talk to Ned 'bout de quality, Marsa.\"    \"And when did I ever talk to you about the quality, you scalawag?\" asks  the Colonel, laughing.    \"Th' ain't none 'cept de bes' quality keep they word dat-a-way,\" said  Ned, as he went off to tell Uncle Ben in the kitchen.    Was there ever, in all this wide country, a good cook who was not a  tyrant? Uncle Ben Carvel was a veritable emperor in his own domain; and  the Colonel himself, had he desired to enter the kitchen, would have  been obliged to come with humble and submissive spirit. As for Virginia,  she had had since childhood more than one passage at arms with Uncle  Ben. And the question of who had come off victorious had been the  subject of many a debate below stairs.    There were a few days in the year, however, when Uncle Ben permitted  the sanctity of his territory to be violated. One was the seventh of  December. On such a day it was his habit to retire to the broken chair  beside the sink (the chair to which he had clung for five-and-twenty  years). There he would sit, blinking, and carrying on the while an  undercurrent of protests and rumblings, while Miss Virginia and other  young ladies mixed and chopped and boiled and baked and gossiped. But  woe to the unfortunate Rosetta if she overstepped the bounds of respect!  Woe to Ned or Jackson or Tato, if they came an inch over the threshold  from the hall beyond! Even Aunt Easter stepped gingerly, though she was  wont to affirm, when assisting Miss Jinny in her toilet, an absolute  contempt for Ben's commands.    \"So Ben ordered you out, Mammy?\" Virginia would say mischievously.    \"Order me out! Hugh! think I'se skeered o' him, honey? Reckon I'd frail  'em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands. Jes' let him try  to come upstairs once, honey, an' see what I say to 'm.\"    Nevertheless Ben had, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, ordered  Mammy Easter out, and she had gone. And now, as she was working the beat  biscuits to be baked that evening, Uncle Ben's eye rested on her with  suspicion.    What mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which  were prepared in Uncle's kitchen that morning? No need in those days of  cooking schools. What Southern lady, to the manner born, is not a cook  from the cradle? Even Ben noted with approval Miss Virginia's scorn for  pecks and pints, and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches  of spices and flavors which she used. And he did Miss Eugenie the honor  to eat one of her praleens.    That night came Captain Lige Brent, the figure of an eager and  determined man swinging up the street, and pulling out his watch under  every lamp-post. And in his haste, in the darkness of a midblock, he  ran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat,  beside a wood wagon.    \"Howdy, Captain,\" said he of the high boots.    \"Well, I just thought as much,\" was the energetic reply; \"minute I seen  the rig I knew Captain Grant was behind it.\"    He held out a big hand, which Captain Grant clasped, just looking at  his own with a smile. The stranger was Captain Elijah Brent of the  'Louisiana'.    \"Now,\" said Brent, \"I'll just bet a full cargo that you're off to the  Planters' House, and smoke an El Sol with the boys.\"    Mr. Grant nodded. \"You're keen, Captain,\" said he.    \"I've got something here that'll outlast an El Sol a whole day,\"  continued Captain Breast, tugging at his pocket and pulling out a  six-inch cigar as black as the night. \"Just you try that.\"    The Captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a  silent enjoyment which delighted his friend.    \"Reckon he don't bring out cigars when you make him a call,\" said the  steamboat captain, jerking his thumb up at the house. It was Mr. Jacob  Cluyme's.    Captain Grant did not reply to that, nor did Captain Lige expect him to,  as it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no  one. He turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon.    \"Where are you off to, Lige?\" he asked.    \"Lord bless my soul,\" said Captain Lige, \"to think that I could forget!\"  He tucked a bundle tighter under his arm. \"Grant, did you ever see my  little sweetheart, Jinny Carvel?\" The Captain sighed. \"She ain't little  any more, and she eighteen to-day.\"    Captain Grant clapped his hand to his forehead.    \"Say, Lige,\" said he, \"that reminds me. A month or so ago I pulled a  fellow out of Renault's area across from there. First I thought he was  a thief. After he got away I saw the Colonel and his daughter in the  window.\"    Instantly Captain Lige became excited, and seized Captain Grant by the  cape of his overcoat.    \"Say, Grant, what kind of appearing fellow was he?\"    \"Short, thick-set, blocky face.\"    \"I reckon I know,\" said Breast, bringing down his fist on the wagon  board; \"I've had my eye on him for some little time.\"    He walked around the block twice after Captain Grant had driven down the  muddy street, before he composed himself to enter the Carvel mansion. He  paid no attention to the salutations of Jackson, the butler, who saw him  coming and opened the door, but climbed the stairs to the sitting-room.    \"Why, Captain Lige, you must have put wings on the Louisiana,\" said  Virginia, rising joyfully from the arm of her father's chair to meet  him. \"We had given you up.\"    \"What?\" cried the Captain. \"Give me up? Don't you know better than that?  What, give me up when I never missed a birthday,--and this the best of  all of 'em.    \"If your pa had got sight of me shovin' in wood and cussin' the pilot  for slowin' at the crossin's, he'd never let you ride in my boat again.  Bill Jenks said: 'Are you plum crazy, Brent? Look at them cressets.'  'Five dollars'' says I; 'wouldn't go in for five hundred. To-morrow's  Jinny Carvel's birthday, and I've just got to be there.' I reckon the  time's come when I've got to say Miss Jinny,\" he added ruefully.    The Colonel rose, laughing, and hit the Captain on the back.    \"Drat you, Lige, why don't you kiss the girl? Can't you see she's  waiting?\"    The honest Captain stole one glance at Virginia, and turned red copper  color.    \"Shucks, Colonel, I can't be kissing her always. What'll her husband  say?\"    For an instant Mr. Carvel's brow clouded.    \"We'll not talk of husbands yet awhile, Lige.\"    Virginia went up to Captain Lige, deftly twisted into shape his black  tie, and kissed him on the check. How his face burned when she touched  him.    \"There!\" said she, \"and don't you ever dare to treat me as a young lady.  Why, Pa, he's blushing like a girl. I know. He's ashamed to kiss me now.  He's going to be married at last to that Creole girl in New Orleans.\"    The Colonel slapped his knee, winked slyly at Lige, while Virginia began  to sing:           \"I built me a house on the mountain so high,          To gaze at my true love as she do go by.\"    \"There's only one I'd ever marry, Jinny,\" protested the Captain,  soberly, \"and I'm a heap too old for her. But I've seen a youngster  that might mate with her, Colonel,\" he added mischievously. \"If he just  wasn't a Yankee. Jinny, what's the story I hear about Judge Whipple's  young man buying Hester?\"    Mr. Carvel looked uneasy. It was Virginia's turn to blush, and she grew  red as a peony.    \"He's a tall, hateful, Black Republican Yankee!\" she said.    \"Phee-ew!\" whistled the Captain. \"Any more epithets?\"    \"He's a nasty Abolitionist!\"    \"There you do him wrong, honey,\" the Colonel put in.    \"I hear he took Hester to Miss Crane's,\" the Captain continued, filling  the room with his hearty laughter. \"That boy has sand enough, Jinny; I'd  like to know him.\"    \"You'll have that priceless opportunity to-night,\" retorted Miss  Virginia, as she flung herself out of the room. \"Pa has made me invite  him to my party.\"    \"Here, Jinny! Hold on!\" cried the Captain, running after her. \"I've got  something for you.\"    She stopped on the stairs, hesitating. Whereupon the Captain hastily  ripped open the bundle under his arm and produced a very handsome India  shawl. With a cry of delight Virginia threw it over her shoulders and  ran to the long glass between the high windows.    \"Who spoils her, Lige?\" asked the Colonel, fondly.    \"Her father, I reckon,\" was the prompt reply.    \"Who spoils you, Jinny?\"    \"Captain Lige,\" said she, turning to him. \"If you had only kept the  presents you have brought me from New Orleans, you might sell out your  steamboat and be a rich man.\"    \"He is a rich man,\" said the Colonel, promptly. \"Did you ever miss  bringing her a present, Lige?\" he asked.    \"When the Cora Anderson burnt,\" answered the Captain.    \"Why,\" cried Virginia, \"you brought me a piece of her wheel, with the  char on it. You swam ashore with it.\"    \"So I did,\" said Captain Brent. \"I had forgotten that. It was when the  French dress, with the furbelows, which Madame Pitou had gotten me from  Paris for you, was lost.\"    \"And I think I liked the piece of wheel better,\" says Virginia. \"It was  brought me by a brave man, the last to leave his boat.\"    \"And who should be the last to leave, but the captain? I saw the thing  in the water; and I just thought we ought to have a relic.\"    \"Lige,\" said the Colonel, putting up his feet, \"do you remember the  French toys you used to bring up here from New Orleans?\"    \"Colonel,\" replied Brent, \"do you recall the rough and uncouth young  citizen who came over here from Cincinnati, as clerk on the Vicksburg?\"    \"I remember, sir, that he was so promising that they made him  provisional captain the next trip, and he was not yet twenty-four years  of age.\"    \"And do you remember buying the Vicksburg at the sheriff's sale for  twenty thousand dollars, and handing her over to young Brent, and  saying, 'There, my son, she's your boat, and you can pay for her when  you like'?\"    \"Shucks,"]]]
