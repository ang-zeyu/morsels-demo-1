What did they  think he was, anyway? A kidnapper?    Instantly I decided I would hurry back to Port Vigor without delay.  If Andrew had had the Professor locked up, it could only be on the  charge of defrauding me. Certainly it couldn't be for giving him a  bloody nose on the road from Shelby. And if I appeared to deny the  charge, surely they would have to let Mr. Mifflin go.    I believe I must have been talking to myself in Peg's stall--at  any rate, just at this moment the stableman appeared and looked  very bewildered when he saw me, with flushed face and in obvious  excitement, talking to the horse. I asked him when was the next  train to Port Vigor.    \"Well, ma'am,\" he said, \"they say that all the local trains is held  up till the wreck at Willdon's cleared away. This being Sunday, I  don't think you'll get anything from here until to-morrow morning.\"    I reflected. It wasn't so awfully far back to Port Vigor. A flivver  from the local garage could spin me back there in a couple of  hours at the most. But somehow it seemed more fitting to go to the  Professor's rescue in his own Parnassus, even if it would take  longer to get there. To tell the truth, while I was angry and  humiliated at the thought of his being put in jail by Andrew, I  couldn't help, deep down within me, being rather thankful. Suppose  he had been in the wreck? The Sage of Redfield had played the part  of Providence after all. And if I set out right away with Parnassus,  I could get to Port Vigor--well, by Monday morning anyway.    The good people of the Moose Hotel were genuinely surprised at  the hurry with which I dispatched my lunch. But I gave them no  explanations. Goodness knows, my head was full of other thoughts and  the apple sauce might have been asbestos. You know, a woman only  falls in love once in her life, and if it waits until she's darn  near forty--well, it _takes!_ You see I hadn't even been vaccinated  against it by girlish flirtations. I began to be a governess when  I was just a kid, and a governess doesn't get many chances to be  skittish. So now when it came, it hit me hard. That's when a woman  finds herself--when she's in love. I don't care if she _is_ old or  fat or homely or prosy. She feels that little flutter under her ribs  and she drops from the tree like a ripe plum. I didn't care if Roger  Mifflin and I were as odd a couple as old Dr. Johnson and his wife,  I only knew one thing: that when I saw that little red devil again I  was going to be all his--if he'd have me. That's why the old Moose  Hotel in Bath is always sacred to me. That's where I learned that  life still held something fresh for me--something better than baking  champlain biscuits for Andrew.       *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    That Sunday was one of those mellow, golden days that we New  Englanders get in October. The year really begins in March, as  every farmer knows, and by the end of September or the beginning of  October the season has come to its perfect, ripened climax. There  are a few days when the world seems to hang still in a dreaming,  sweet hush, at the very fulness of the fruit before the decline  sets in. I have no words (like Andrew) to describe it, but every  autumn for years I have noticed it. I remember that sometimes at  the farm I used to lean over the wood pile for a moment just before  supper to watch those purple October sunsets. I would hear the sharp  ting of Andrew's little typewriter bell as he was working in his  study. And then I would try to swallow down within me the beauty  and wistfulness of it all, and run back to mash the potatoes.    Peg drew Parnassus along the backward road with a merry little  rumble. I think she knew we were going back to the Professor.  Bock careered mightily along the wayside. And I had much time for  thinking. On the whole, I was glad; for I had much to ponder. An  adventure that had started as a mere lark or whim had now become for  me the very gist of life itself. I was fanciful, I guess, and as  romantic as a young hen, but by the bones of George Eliot, I'm sorry  for the woman that never has a chance to be fanciful. Mifflin was  in jail; aye, but he might have been dead and--unrecognizable! My  heart refused to be altogether sad. I was on my way to deliver him  from durance vile. There seemed a kinship between the season and  myself, I mused, seeing the goldenrod turning bronze and droopy  along the way. Here was I, in the full fruition of womanhood, on the  verge of my decline into autumn, and lo! by the grace of God, I had  found my man, my master. He had touched me with his own fire and  courage. I didn't care what happened to Andrew, or to Sabine Farm,  or to anything else in the world. Here were my hearth and my  home--Parnassus, or wherever Roger should pitch his tent. I dreamed  of crossing the Brooklyn Bridge with him at dusk, watching the  skyscrapers etched against a burning sky. I believed in calling  things by their true names. Ink is ink, even if the bottle is marked  \"commercial fluid.\" I didn't try to blink the fact that I was in  love. In fact, I gloried in it. As Parnassus rolled along the road,  and the scarlet maple leaves eddied gently down in the blue October  air, I made up a kind of chant which I called      Hymn for a Middle-Aged Woman (Fat)    Who Has Fallen into Love      O God, I thank Thee who sent this great adventure my way!    I am grateful to have come out of the barren land of    spinsterhood, seeing the glory of a love greater than myself.    I thank Thee for teaching me that mixing, and kneading, and    baking are not all that life holds for me. Even if he doesn't    love me, God, I shall always be his.    I was crooning some such babble as this to myself when, near  Woodbridge, I came upon a big, shiny motor car stranded by the  roadside. Several people, evidently intelligent and well-to-do,  sat under a tree while their chauffeur fussed with a tire. I was  so absorbed in my own thoughts that I think I should have gone  by without paying them much heed, but suddenly I remembered the  Professor's creed--to preach the gospel of books in and out of  season. Sunday or no Sunday, I thought I could best honour Mifflin  by acting on his own principle. I pulled up by the side of the road.    I noticed the people turn to one another in a kind of surprise, and  whisper something. There was an elderly man with a lean, hard-worked  face; a stout woman, evidently his wife; and two young girls and a  man in golfing clothes. Somehow the face of the older man seemed  familiar. I wondered whether he were some literary friend of  Andrew's whose photo I had seen.    Bock stood by the wheel with his long, curly tongue running in and  out over his teeth. I hesitated a moment, thinking just how to  phrase my attack, when the elderly gentleman called out:    \"Where's the Professor?\"    I was beginning to realize that Mifflin was indeed a public character.    \"Heavens!\" I said. \"Do you know him, too?\"    \"Well, I should think so,\" he said. \"Didn't he come to see me last  spring about an appropriation for school libraries, and wouldn't  leave till I'd promised to do what he wanted! He stayed the night  with us and we talked literature till four o'clock in the morning.  Where is he now? Have you taken over Parnassus?\"    \"Just at present,\" I said, \"Mr. Mifflin is in the jail at Port Vigor.\"    The ladies gave little cries of astonishment, and the gentleman  himself (I had sized him up as a school commissioner or something  of that sort) seemed not less surprised.    \"In jail!\" he said. \"What on earth for? Has he sandbagged somebody  for reading Nick Carter and Bertha M. Clay? That's about the only  crime he'd be likely to commit.\"    \"He's supposed to have cozened me out of four hundred dollars,\" I  said, \"and my brother has had him locked up. But as a matter of fact  he wouldn't swindle a hen out of a new-laid egg. I bought Parnassus  of my own free will. I'm on my way to Port Vigor now to get him out.  Then I'm going to ask him to marry me--if he will. It's not leap  year, either.\"    He looked at me, his thin, lined face working with friendliness. He  was a fine-looking man--short, gray hair brushed away from a broad,  brown forehead. I noticed his rich, dark suit and the spotless  collar. This was a man of breeding, evidently.    \"Well, Madam,\" he said, \"any friend of the Professor is a friend of  ours.\" (His wife and the girls chimed in with assent.) \"If you would  like a lift in our car to speed you on your errand, I'm sure Bob  here would be glad to drive Parnassus into Port Vigor. Our tire will  soon be mended.\"    The young man assented heartily, but as I said before, I was bent  on taking Parnassus back myself. I thought the sight of his own  tabernacle would be the best balm for Mifflin's annoying experience.  So I refused the offer, and explained the situation a little more  fully.    \"Well,\" he said, \"then let me help in any way I can.\" He took a  card from his pocket-book and scribbled something on it. \"When you  get to Port Vigor,\" he said, \"show this at the jail and I don't  think you'll have any trouble. I happen to know the people there.\"    So after a hand-shake all round I went on again, much cheered by  this friendly little incident. It wasn't till I was some way along  the road that I thought of looking at the card he had given me. Then  I realized why the man's face had been familiar. The card read quite  simply:    RALEIGH STONE STAFFORD    The Executive Mansion,  Darlington.    It was the Governor of the State!        CHAPTER FOURTEEN      I couldn't help chuckling, as Parnassus came over the brow of the  hill, and I saw the river in the distance once more. How different  all this was from my girlhood visions of romance. That has been  characteristic of my life all along--it has been full of homely,  workaday happenings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#18)"],[1,"testified, at this raising of  difficulties on the part of Kate. \"Come along, girls.\"    They ascended to the decorated apartment before described; and there,  although she found the \"grand rose-wood,\" as it was termed by the  family, to be deplorably out of tune also, Kate performed a noisy  introduction and march, which she guessed would be most likely to suit  her auditors; a song was then demanded, and given; and mother and  daughters exchanged glances, which said very plainly--\"We've drawn a  prize!\"    \"Well, I'm sure that's very nice,\" began Mrs. Potter. \"I have no  objection to engage you.\"    Then came the discussion of terms; the greatest trial poor Kate had yet  encountered. It was so difficult to name her price, so hard to bear  the attempt to beat her down; yet all things must have an end; and, at  length, she was finally engaged. Then, with what a feeling of relief  she walked briskly on to meet Mrs. O'Toole, who was loitering about in  waiting for her young mistress.    \"How valuable poor Mr. Gilpin's hints have been to me,\" thought she;  \"what exquisite torture that whole interview would have been, had I  not, by his advice, made up my mind to treat and think of the whole  affair as a business transaction, which could not touch me really.\"    Nurse was less curious than usual--the subject was one that could  only give her pain and grief, so she contented herself with Kate's  general assurance that all was satisfactorily settled. The Colonel,  notwithstanding all his consideration for his loving, self-forgetting  child, could not suppress a groan, when he heard all the particulars  she thought fit to give.    \"Ah, dear Kate! what costs us so dear, brings but little into our  exchequer.\"    \"But I shall get more pupils, you know, and then--\"    \"Well, God's will be done!\"    The lessons at Brompton began the next day; and Kate was surprised  to find how rapidly the time flew in the endeavour to convey her own  knowledge to her pupils; then the walk back, accompanied by Cormac, who  lay outside the hall door, like a chiselled effigy of watchfulness, all  the time the lesson lasted, was charming. The welcome from nurse and  grandpapa! how grateful the task to work for them. \"All I ask of Thee,  oh Mighty Parent! is abundance of work!\" she often murmured, almost  aloud.    Thus cheered, she wrote in a strain of unwonted gaiety to Winter,  promising him an account of Mrs. Storey's _soirée_, at which nurse  was determined her darling should appear in most _recherché_ costume;  but, to her dismay, the object of all this care, refused to appear in  anything but \"a demi-toilette.\"    \"An' why won't ye show yer illigant white neck, an' arums, just to let  them see what we've got in ould Ireland?\"    \"You see, it will be a small party, nurse; and, at all events, I would  rather look too little, than too much, dressed; besides, it is of no  consequence; yet, that is not quite true,\" she added, with a frank  smile, \"I should not like to look frightful.\"    So she had her own way, and wore the style of dress she preferred.  Nurse produced a very handsome bouquet, just at the critical moment  when the toilette was \"_un fait accompli_,\" and Kate was thinking how  unfinished her costume looked without what had hitherto been, with her,  an invariable accompaniment.    \"Oh, nurse, how lovely! and you have got these for me! Ah, you spoil  your child! but I am so glad to have them! Now I am indeed _mise a  ravir_; and shall value them a thousand times more as your gift, than  if they were from--\"    \"The Captin?\" put in Mrs. O'Toole, slily.    \"Yes, far more,\" said Kate, and she spoke the truth, for the moment.    Some slight delay in procuring a cab, rendered their appearance at Mrs.  Storey's later than they had intended, and her rooms were more than  half full when they entered. There was the usual group of gentlemen  near the door, conversing in under tones with each other; there was  the same spare sprinkling of broad cloth, amongst the silks, satins,  and muslins, seated stiffly round the walls, or rigidly enthroned on  ottomans; the same half dozen of bolder spirits, more at home with the  company than those about the door, amongst whom the _facetious man_,  (for there is always such at third rate parties), shone conspicuous,  entreating the ladies to teach him the language of flowers, or  propounding far-fetched conundrums, ending, invariably, with, \"do you  give it up?\"    Tea and coffee was being handed round by two most respectable-looking  men, whose faces seemed strangely familiar to Kate, until she  remembered that she saw them almost daily, at the gate of Kensington  Gardens, mounting guard over the Bath chairs, which they had there for  hire; and young ladies were gently nibbling small squares of cake, and  then depositing them in their saucers, as if ashamed of being guilty of  so sublunary an occupation; in short, there was every thing that could  possibly be expected at a _soirée_ of the class we are describing.    The appearance of Colonel Vernon, with his elegant-looking  granddaughter, drew general attention; and a whisper of curiosity ran  round the room, as each one felt, instinctively, there was something  in the newly arrived guests, different from themselves. Miss Vernon  advanced through the numerous company, to her total strangers, with  the quiet self-possession which so peculiarly distinguished her, and  which had struck Egerton so forcibly, at the memorable ball, where they  had first met. It was so different from the assured manner of a veteran  society hunter, or the \"look at me,\" air of a professed beauty, and  seemed to say, \"there is no position so lofty, where I should be out of  place.\"    Mrs. Storey welcomed her new acquaintance with great warmth, advancing  rapidly to meet them, with a huge bouquet held fiercely in her hand  like a Lancer charging the foe.    \"Very glad to see you, Miss Vernon, and your grandpa, looking so  well--Mr. Storey, Colonel Vernon, Miss Vernon, &c.\"    Mr. Storey was a rubicund, jolly looking man, not yet absolutely fat,  but promising well for the time to come; slightly bald, with small  twinkling eyes, and an inveterate affection for the letter R; moreover,  he constantly held his hands in his trowsers' pockets; laughed often a  fat laugh, had an unmistakeable air of prosperity, and was altogether  what Mrs. Storey, called, \"very good company.\"    \"Happy to see you, Miss Vernon, happy to see you, sir; just a few  friends, what my friend Jones calls a \"tea fight,\" that's his  interpretation of \"a _soirée_.\"    Langley here disengaged himself, rather abruptly, from a group of two  or three bold, confident-looking girls, and pale dishevelled men,  evidently artistic, to greet the Vernons, very warmly for him.    \"Let me get you a seat, Miss Vernon,\" said Mrs. Storey, drawing Kate  towards the group Mr. Langley had just left. \"Sorry I was out when you  called yesterday. Did you arrange with Mrs. Potter?\"    \"Yes, and I have to thank you and Mr. Langley for procuring me my first  pupils.\"    \"Oh, I was very glad.\"    \"Miss Dent,\" said Mrs. Storey to one of the dashing looking young  ladies, before mentioned, \"let me introduce Miss Vernon, you are both  very musical; Miss Vernon plays beautifully, I am told; we hope to hear  her farther on in the evening--Miss Charlotte Dent.\"    And Kate, to her dismay, was left to the tender mercies of these  evidently \"very fashionable,\" girls, who were, \"_en grande tenue_,\"  with the lowest cut dresses, and shortest sleeves permissible in  society.    \"Been long in town?\" said the eldest, (after a deliberate survey of  Miss Vernon's simple costume,) in a bold and rather deep toned voice.    Kate replied courteously, and turned to see what had become of the  Colonel; he was engaged, apparently, in interesting conversation with  Mr. Langley, and satisfied that he did not feel lonely, she gave her  attention to the people round her.    \"Were you ever in town before?\" continued her examiner.    \"Oh, yes, for some time, three years ago.\"    \"Horrid place at this time of year. I am counting the days until I  start for Germany.\"    Here one of Langley's dishevelled friends, from some change in the  surrounding group (for the rooms were now almost crowded), suddenly  stepped back, and in so doing, trod on Miss Vernon's dress; he begged  pardon with much empressement, in a manner which bespoke him to be no  common man; he was pale, thin and foreign-looking, with deep sunk,  flashing eyes, wild hair, and an unsteady expression of countenance.    \"I am always doing these sort of things, and have vowed a hundred times  never to brave the dangers of a _soirée_ again; but,\" he shrugged his  shoulders.    \"_Passato l'pericolo gabbato l'santo_,\" said Kate, gaily and archly;  judging from his air and manner, that this scrap of poor Winter's lore  would be understood.    \"_La Signorina parla l'Italiano_,\" he exclaimed, joyously.    \"So little that I dare not venture to begin a conversation in it,\" she  replied, as she did not consider it impossible to speak to a stranger  without a formal introduction.    \"Yet you pronounce it correctly,\" said the wild looking man.    \"You think so?\"    \"Yes, and although it is not my native tongue, I love it, as if it  were.\"    \"So did the friend from whom I learned what little I know of it, and  the proverb I have just said; yet no; not quite so well as his own  tongue, for _he_ was English.\"    \"Your emphasis would imply that you think I am not, nor am I.\"    \"Mr. Winter used to say----\"    \"Winter!\" he interrupted, \"is he the painter who has buried himself so  strangely in some monastic tomb, some old city, \"_en Province_?\"\"    \"The same.\"    \"Then you are the young lady Langley spoke of?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"_Maraviglia!_\"    \"Why are you surprised?\" asked Kate, smiling.    He only repeated, \"_maraviglia!_\"    \"Miss Dent, will you kindly play us something,\" said Mrs. Storey,  sailing up, bouquet "]]]
