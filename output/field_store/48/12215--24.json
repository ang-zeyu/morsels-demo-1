[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#18)"],[1," of the  lotus-eater's chant, \"There is no joy but calm,\" with, for, the first  time in my life, a dim perception of what they meant, perhaps; but  it was over all too quickly: prosaic words of direction to back water  called us from shade to light, and in a moment more we were in front of  the rata-trees, admiring their splendid colouring, and our little boat  was dancing away over the bright waves, with her white wings set and her  bows pointed towards the little toy island in the middle of the lake; it  was no question now of rowing, a nice fresh breeze from the south (the  _cold_ point here) sent us swiftly and steadily through the water. What  a morning it was! The air was positively intoxicating, making you feel  that the mere fact of being a living creature with lungs to inhale such  an atmosphere was a great boon. We have a good deal of disagreeable  weather, and a small proportion of bad weather, but in no other part of  the world, I believe, does Nature so thoroughly understand how to make a  fine day as in New Zealand.    A little after mid-day we ran our boat to the lee of the island, and:  whilst she was steadied by the same primitive method of holding on to  branches of manuka and other scrub, I scrambled out and up a little  cliff, where a goat could hardly have found footing, till I reached  a spot big enough to stand on, from whence I anxiously watched the  disembarkation of some of the provisions, and of the gridiron and  kettle. In a few moments we were all safely ashore, and busy collecting  dry fern and brushwood for a fire; it was rather a trial of patience to  wait till the great blaze had subsided before we attempted to cook our  chops, which were all neatly prepared ready for us. Some large potatoes  were put to bake in the ashes; the tin plates were warmed (it is a great  art not to overheat them when you have to keep them on your lap whilst  you eat your chop). We were all so terribly hungry that we were obliged  to have a course of bread and cheese and sardines _first_; it was really  quite impossible to wait patiently for the chops. The officiating cook  scolded us well for our Vandalism, and the next moment we detected him  in the act of devouring a half-raw potato. The fragments of our meal  must have been a great boon to the colony of wekas who inhabit the  island, for as they increase and multiply prodigiously their provisions  must often fall short in so small a space. No one can imagine how these  birds originally came here, for the island is at least two miles from  the nearest point of land; they can neither swim nor fly; and as every  man's hand is against them, no one would have thought it worth while  to bring them over: but here they are, in spite of all the apparent  impossibilities attending their arrival, more tame and impudent than  ever. It was dangerous to leave your bread unwatched for an instant, and  indeed I saw one gliding off with an empty sardine tin in its beak;  I wonder how it liked oil and little scales. They considered a cork a  great prize, and carried several off triumphantly.    After luncheon there was the usual interval of rest, and pipes on the  part of the gentlemen. I explored a little, but there is nothing very  pretty or abundant in the way of wild flowers in the parts of New  Zealand which I have seen. White violets and a ground clematis are the  only ones I have come across in any quantity. The manuka, a sort of  scrub, has a pretty blossom like a diminutive Michaelmas daisy, white  petals and a brown centre, with a very aromatic odour; and this little  flower is succeeded by a berry with the same strong smell and taste of  spice. The shepherds sometimes make an infusion of these when they  are very hard-up for tea; but it must be like drinking a decoction of  cloves.    About three o'clock we re-embarked, and sailed a little higher up the  lake beyond the point where we lose sight of it from Mr. H----'s house,  every moment opening out fresh and more beautiful glimpses. Quite the  opposite end of the shore is fringed with a thick deep forest, and  another station has been built there, at which, I am told, the scenery  is still more magnificent. At first I was inclined to wonder where the  sheep live amid all this picturesque but mountainous country: however,  I find that between and among these hills stretch immense valleys (or  \"flats,\" as they are called here), which are warm and sheltered in  winter, and afford plenty of food for them; then, in summer, they go up  to the mountains: but it is very difficult to \"muster\" these ranges. I  am almost ashamed to confess to another meal before we returned home,  but there was a lovely tempting spot in a little harbour, and so we  landed and boiled some water and had a capital cup of tea. You require  to be out as we were from morning till night in such an air as this to  know what it is to feel either hungry or sleepy in perfection! The next  day we made a similar excursion, exploring the opposite shore of the  lake; but, before we started, our host distrusted the appearance of  certain clouds, and sent round horses to meet us at the point where  we were going to lunch; and it was just as well he did so, for a stiff  breeze sprang up from the south-west, which would have kept us out all  night. So we mounted the horses instead of re-embarking, having first  secured the boat, and cantered home. We passed several smaller lakes;  there is a perfect chain of them among these hills, and I was much  amused at the names bestowed on them, according to the tastes or caprice  of the station-owners whose runs happen to include them: for instance,  two are called respectively \"Geraldine\" and \"Ida,\" whilst three, which  lie close together, rejoice in the somewhat extraordinary names of \"the  World,\" \"the Flesh,\" and \"the Devil.\"          Letter XVII: My first and last experience of \"camping out.\"      Broomielaw, April 1867. I have nothing to tell you this mail, except  of a rather ridiculous expedition which we made last week, and which  involved our spending the whole night on the top of the highest hill on  our run. You will probably wonder what put such an idea into our heads,  so I must preface my account by a little explanation. Whenever I meet  any people who came here in the very early days of the colony--only  sixteen years ago, after all!--I delight in persuading them to tell me  about their adventures and hardships during those primitive times, and  these narratives have the greatest fascination for me, as they always  end happily. No one ever seems to have died of his miseries, or even  to have suffered seriously in any way from them, so I find the greatest  delight in listening to the stories of the Pilgrims. I envy them  dreadfully for having gone through so much with such spirit and  cheerfulness, and ever since I came here I have regretted that the rapid  advance of civilization in New Zealand precludes the possibility of  being really uncomfortable; this makes me feel like an impostor, for I  am convinced that my English friends think of me with the deepest pity,  as of one cut off from the refinements and comforts of life, whereas I  really am surrounded by every necessary, and many of its luxuries, and  there is no reason but that of expense why one should not have all of  these.    One class of narratives is peculiarly attractive to me. I like to hear  of benighted or belated travellers when they have had to \"camp out,\"  as it is technically called; and have lived in constant hope of meeting  with an adventure which would give me a similar experience. But I am  gradually becoming convinced that this is almost impossible by fair  means, so I have been trying for some time past to excite in the breasts  of our home party and of our nearest neighbours an ardent desire to see  the sun rise from the top of \"Flagpole,\" a hill 3,000 feet above the  level of the sea, and only a: couple of miles from the house. As soon  as they were sufficiently enthusiastic on the subject, I broached my  favourite project of our all going up there over-night, and camping  out on the highest peak. Strange to say, the plan did not meet with any  opposition, even from F----, who has had to camp out many a winter's  night, and with whom, therefore, the novelty may be said to have worn  off. Two gentlemen of the proposed party were \"new chums\" like myself,  and were strongly in favour of a little roughing; new-chums always are,  I observe. F---- hesitated a little about giving a final consent on  the score of its being rather too late in the year, and talked of a  postponement till next summer, but we would not listen to such an idea;  so he ended by entering so heartily into it, that when at last the  happy day and hour came, an untoward shower had not the least effect in  discouraging him.    There was a great bustle about the little homestead on that eventful  Tuesday afternoon. Two very steady old horses were saddled, one for me  and the other for one of the \"new chums,\" who was not supposed to be  in good form for a long walk, owing to a weak knee. Everything which we  thought we could possibly want was heaped on and around us after we  had mounted; the rest of the gentlemen, four in number, walked, and  we reached the first stage of our expedition in about an hour. Here we  dismounted, as the horses could go no further in safety. The first  thing done was to see to their comfort and security; the saddles were  carefully deposited under a large flax-bush in case of rain, and the  long tether ropes were arranged so as to ensure plenty of good feed and  water for both horses, without the possibility of the ropes becoming  entangled in each other or in anything else. Then came a time of great  excitement and laughing and talking, for all the \"swags\" had to be  packed and apportioned for the very long and steep ascent before us.    And now I must tell you exactly what we took up. A pair of large double  blankets"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#18)"],[1,"of him,' he said.    The two argued for a minute, and then Laputa seemed to prevail.  The  door was shut and the key, which I had left in the lock, turned on me.    I gave them five minutes to get to the outhouse and settle to business.  Then I opened the trap, got into the cellar, and crawled to the other  end.  A ray of light was coming through the partially raised door.  By  a blessed chance some old bricks had been left behind, and of these I  made a footstool, which enabled me to get my back level with the door  and look out. My laager of barrels was intact, but through a gap I had  left I could see the two men sitting on the two cases I had provided  for them.  A lantern was set between them, and Henriques was drinking  out of a metal flask.    He took something--I could not see what--out of his pocket, and held it  before his companion.    'Spoils of war,' he said.  'I let Sikitola's men draw first blood. They  needed it to screw up their courage.  Now they are as wild as Umbooni's.    Laputa asked a question.    'It was the Dutchmen, who were out on the Koodoo Flats with their  cattle.  Man, it's no good being squeamish.  Do you think you can talk  over these surly back-veld fools?  If we had not done it, the best of  their horses would now be over the Berg to give warning.  Besides, I  tell you, Sikitola's men wanted blooding.  I did for the old swine,  Coetzee, with my own hands.  Once he set his dogs on me, and I don't  forget an injury.'    Laputa must have disapproved, for Henriques' voice grew high.    'Run the show the way you please,' he cried; 'but don't blame me if you  make a hash of it.  God, man, do you think you are going to work a  revolution on skim milk?  If I had my will, I would go in and stick a  knife in the drunken hog next door.'    'He is safe enough,' Laputa replied.  'I gave him the chance of life,  and he laughed at me.  He won't get far on his road home.'    This was pleasant hearing for me, but I scarcely thought of myself.  I  was consumed with a passion of fury against the murdering yellow devil.  With Laputa I was not angry; he was an open enemy, playing a fair game.  But my fingers itched to get at the Portugoose--that double-dyed  traitor to his race.  As I thought of my kindly old friends, lying  butchered with their kinsfolk out in the bush, hot tears of rage came  to my eyes. Perfect love casteth out fear, the Bible says; but, to  speak it reverently, so does perfect hate.  Not for safety and a king's  ransom would I have drawn back from the game.  I prayed for one thing  only, that God in His mercy would give me the chance of settling with  Henriques.    I fancy I missed some of the conversation, being occupied with my own  passion.  At any rate, when I next listened the two were deep in plans.  Maps were spread beside them, and Laputa's delicate forefinger was  tracing a route.  I strained my ears, but could catch only a few names.  Apparently they were to keep in the plains till they had crossed the  Klein Labongo and the Letaba.  I thought I caught the name of the ford  of the latter; it sounded like Dupree's Drift.  After that the talk  became plainer, for Laputa was explaining in his clear voice. The force  would leave the bush, ascend the Berg by the glen of the Groot Letaba,  and the first halt would be called at a place called Inanda's Kraal,  where a promontory of the high-veld juts out behind the peaks called  the Wolkberg or Cloud Mountains.  All this was very much to the point,  and the names sunk into my memory like a die into wax.    'Meanwhile,' said Laputa, 'there is the gathering at Ntabakaikonjwa.[1]  It will take us three hours' hard riding to get there.'    Where on earth was Ntabakaikonjwa?  It must be the native name for the  Rooirand, for after all Laputa was not likely to use the Dutch word for  his own sacred place.    'Nothing has been forgotten.  The men are massed below the cliffs, and  the chiefs and the great indunas will enter the Place of the Snake.  The door will be guarded, and only the password will get a man through.  That word is \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"God with us.\"'    'Well, when we get there, what happens?' Henriques asked with a laugh.  'What kind of magic will you spring on us?'    There was a strong contrast between the flippant tone of the Portugoose  and the grave voice which answered him.    'The Keeper of the Snake will open the holy place, and bring forth the  Isetembiso sami.[2]  As the leader of my people, I will assume the  collar of Umkulunkulu in the name of our God and the spirits of the  great dead.'    'But you don't propose to lead the march in a necklace of rubies,' said  Henriques, with a sudden eagerness in his voice.    Again Laputa spoke gravely, and, as it were, abstractedly.  I heard the  voice of one whose mind was fixed on a far horizon.    'When I am acclaimed king, I restore the Snake to its Keeper, and swear  never to clasp it on my neck till I have led my people to victory.'    'I see,' said Henriques.  'What about the purification you mentioned?'    I had missed this before and listened earnestly.    'The vows we take in the holy place bind us till we are purged of them  at Inanda's Kraal.  Till then no blood must be shed and no flesh eaten.  It was the fashion of our forefathers.'    'Well, I think you've taken on a pretty risky job,' Henriques said.  'You propose to travel a hundred miles, binding yourself not to strike  a blow.  It is simply putting yourself at the mercy of any police  patrol.'    'There will be no patrol,' Laputa replied.  'Our march will be as  secret and as swift as death.  I have made my preparations.'    'But suppose you met with opposition,' the Portugoose persisted, 'would  the rule hold?'    'If any try to stop us, we shall tie them hand and foot, and carry them  with us.  Their fate will be worse than if they had been slain in  battle.'    'I see,' said Henriques, whistling through his teeth.  'Well, before we  start this vow business, I think I'll go back and settle that  storekeeper.'    Laputa shook his head.  'Will you be serious and hear me? We have no  time to knife harmless fools.  Before we start for Ntabakaikonjwa I  must have from you the figures of the arming in the south.  That is the  one thing which remains to be settled.'    I am certain these figures would have been most interesting, but I  never heard them.  My feet were getting cramped with standing on the  bricks, and I inadvertently moved them.  The bricks came down with a  rattle, and unfortunately in slipping I clutched at the trap.  This was  too much for my frail prop, and the door slammed down with a great  noise.    Here was a nice business for the eavesdropper!  I scurried along the  passage as stealthily as I could and clambered back into the store,  while I heard the sound of Laputa and Henriques ferreting among the  barrels.  I managed to throttle Colin and prevent him barking, but I  could not get the confounded trap to close behind me.  Something had  jammed in it, and it remained half a foot open.    I heard the two approaching the door, and I did the best thing that  occurred to me.  I pulled Colin over the trap, rolled on the top of  him, and began to snore heavily as if in a drunken slumber.    The key was turned, and the gleam of a lantern was thrown on the wall.  It flew up and down as its bearer cast the light into the corners.    'By God, he's gone,' I heard Henriques say.  'The swine was listening,  and he has bolted now.'    'He won't bolt far,' Laputa said.  'He is here.  He is snoring behind  the counter.'    These were anxious moments for me.  I had a firm grip on Colin's  throat, but now and then a growl escaped, which was fortunately blended  with my snores.  I felt that a lantern was flashed on me, and that the  two men were peering down at the heap on the half-opened trap.  I think  that was the worst minute I ever spent, for, as I have said, my courage  was not so bad in action, but in a passive game it oozed out of my  fingers.    'He is safe enough,' Laputa said, after what seemed to me an eternity.  'The noise was only the rats among the barrels.' I thanked my Maker  that they had not noticed the other trap-door. 'All the same I think  I'll make him safer,' said Henriques.    Laputa seemed to have caught him by the arm.    'Come back and get to business,' he said.  'I've told you I'll have no  more murder.  You will do as I tell you, Mr Henriques.'    I did not catch the answer, but the two went out and locked the door.  I patted the outraged Colin, and got to my feet with an aching side  where the confounded lid of the trap had been pressing.  There was no  time to lose for the two in the outhouse would soon be setting out, and  I must be before them.    With no better light than a ray of the moon through the window, I wrote  a message on a leaf from my pocket-book.  I told of the plans I had  overheard, and especially I mentioned Dupree's Drift on the Letaba.  I  added that I was going to the Rooirand to find the secret of the cave,  and in one final sentence implored Arcoll to do justice on the  Portugoose.  That was all, for I had no time for more.  I carefully  tied the paper with a string below the collar of the dog.    Then very quietly I went into the bedroom next door--the side of the  store farthest from the outhouse.  The place was flooded with  moonlight, and the window stood open, as I had left it in the  afternoon.  As softly as I could I swung Colin over the sill and  clambered after him.  In my haste I left my coat behind me with my  pistol in the pocket.    Now came a check.  My horse was stabled in the shed, and that was close  to the outhouse.  The sound of leading him out would most certainly  bring Laputa and Henriques to the door. In that moment I all but  changed my plans.  I thought of slipping back to the outhouse and  trying to shoot the two men as they came forth.  But I reflected that,  before I could get them both, one or"]]]
