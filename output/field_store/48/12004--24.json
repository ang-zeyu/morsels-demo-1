And there be some who plunge  into an unbroken forest with a feeling of fresh, free, invigorating  delight, as they might dash into a crisp ocean surf on a hot day. These  know that nature is stern, hard, immovable and terrible in unrelenting  cruelty. When wintry winds are out and the mercury far below zero, she  will allow her most ardent lover to freeze on her snowy breast without  waving a leaf in pity, or offering him a match; and scores of her  devotees may starve to death in as many different languages before she  will offer a loaf of bread. She does not deal in matches and loaves;  rather in thunderbolts and granite mountains. And the ashes of her  camp-fires bury proud cities. But, like all tyrants, she yields to  force, and gives the more, the more she is beaten. She may starve or  freeze the poet, the scholar, the scientist; all the same, she has in  store food, fuel and shelter, which the skillful, self-reliant woodsman  can wring from her savage hand with axe and rifle.        Only to him whose coat of rags          Has pressed at night her regal feet,          Shall come the secrets, strange and sweet,      Of century pines and beetling crags.        For him the goddess shall unlock          The golden secrets which have lain          Ten thousand years, through frost and rain,      Deep in the bosom of the rock.    The trip was a long and tiresome one, considering the distance. There  were no hairbreadth escapes; I was not tackled by bears, treed by  wolves, or nearly killed by a hand-to-claw \"racket\" with a panther; and  there were no Indians to come sneak-hunting around after hair. Animal  life was abundant, exuberant, even. But the bright-eyed woodfolk seemed  tame, nay, almost friendly, and quite intent on minding their own  business. It was a \"pigeon year,\" a \"squirrel year,\" and also a  marvelous year for shack, or mast. Every nut-bearing tree was loaded  with sweet well-filled nuts; and this, coupled with the fact that the  Indians had left, and the whites had not yet got in, probably accounted  for the plentitude of game.    [Sidenote: _Wood Life_]    I do not think there was an hour of daylight on the trip when squirrels  were not too numerous to be counted, while pigeons were a constant  quantity from start to finish. Grouse in the thickets, and quail in the  high oak openings, or small prairies, with droves of wild turkeys among  heavy timber, were met with almost hourly, and there was scarcely a day  on which I could not have had a standing shot at a bear. But the most  interesting point about the game was--to me, at least--the marvelous  abundance of deer. They were everywhere, on all sorts of ground and  among all varieties of timber; very tame they were, too, often stopping  to look at the stranger, offering easy shots at short range, and finally  going off quite leisurely.    No ardent lover of forest life could be lonely in such company, and in  such weather. The only drawback was the harassing and vexatious manner  in which lakes, streams, swamps and marshes constantly persisted in  getting across the way, compelling long detours to the north or south,  when the true course was nearly due west. I think there were days on  which ten hours of pretty faithful tramping did not result in more than  three or four miles of direct headway. The headwaters of the Salt and  Chippewa rivers were especially obstructive; and, when more than half  the distance was covered, I ran into a tangle of small lakes, marshes  and swamps, not marked on the map, which cost a hard day's work to leave  behind.    While there were no startling adventures, and no danger connected with  the trip, there was a constant succession of incidents, that made the  lonely tramp far from monotonous. Some of these occurrences were  intensely interesting, and a little exciting. Perhaps the brief recital  of a few may not be uninteresting at the present day, when game is so  rapidly disappearing.    My rifle was a neat, hair-triggered Billinghurst, carrying sixty round  balls to the pound, a muzzle-loader, of course, and a nail-driver. I  made just three shots in ten days, and each shot stood for a plump young  deer in the \"short blue.\" It seemed wicked to murder such a bright,  graceful animal, when no more than the loins and a couple of slices from  the ham could be used, leaving the balance to the wolves, who never  failed to take possession before I was out of ear shot. But I condoned  the excess, if excess it were, by the many chances I allowed to pass,  not only on deer but bear, and once on a big brute of a wild hog, the  wickedest and most formidable looking animal I ever met in the woods.  The meeting happened in this wise. I had been bothered and wearied for  half a day by a bad piece of low, marshy ground, and had at length  struck a dry, rolling oak opening where I sat down at the foot of a  small oak to rest. I had scarcely been resting ten minutes, when I  caught sight of a large, dirty-white animal, slowly working its way in  my direction through the low bushes, evidently nosing around for acorns.  I was puzzled to say what it was. It looked like a hog, but stood too  high on its legs; and how would such a beast get there anyhow? Nearer  and nearer he came, and at last walked out into an open spot less than  twenty yards distant. It was a wild hog of the ugliest and largest  description; tall as a yearling, with an unnaturally large head, and  dangerous looking tusks, that curved above his savage snout like small  horns. There was promise of magnificent power in his immense shoulders,  while flanks and hams were disproportionately light. He came out to the  open leisurely munching his acorns, or amusing himself by ploughing deep  furrows with his nose, and not until within ten yards did he appear to  note the presence of a stranger. Suddenly he raised his head and became  rigid as though frozen to stone; he was taking an observation. For a few  seconds he remained immovable, then his bristles became erect, and with  a deep guttural, grunting noise, he commenced hitching himself along in  my direction, sidewise. My hair raised, and in an instant I was on my  feet with the cocked rifle to my shoulder--meaning to shoot before his  charge, and then make good time up the tree. But there was no need. As I  sprang to my feet he sprang for the hazel bushes, and went tearing  through them with the speed of a deer, keeping up a succession of snorts  and grunts that could be heard long after he had passed out of sight. I  am not subject to buck fever, and was disgusted to find myself so badly  \"rattled\" that I could scarcely handle the rifle. At first I was  provoked at myself for not getting a good ready and shooting him in the  head, as he came out of the bushes; but it was better to let him live.  He was not carnivorous, or a beast of prey, and ugly as he was,  certainly looked better alive than he would as a porcine corpse. No  doubt he relished his acorns as well as though he had been less ugly,  and he was a savage power in the forest. Bears love pork; and the fact  that the hog was picking up a comfortable living in that wilderness, is  presumptive evidence that he was a match for the largest bear, or he  would have been eaten long before.    [Sidenote: _Incidents_]    Another little incident, in which Bruin played a leading part, rises  vividly to memory. It was hardly an adventure; only the meeting of man  and bear, and they parted on good terms, with no hardness on either  side.    The meeting occurred, as usually was the case with large game, on dry,  oak lands, where the undergrowth was hazel, sassafras, and wild  grapevine. As before, I had paused for a rest, when I began to catch  glimpses of a very black animal working its way among the hazel bushes,  under the scattering oaks, and toward me. With no definite intention of  shooting, but just to see how easy it might be to kill him, I got a good  ready, and waited. Slowly and lazily he nuzzled his way among the trees,  sitting up occasionally to crunch acorns, until he was within  twenty-five yards of me, with the bright bead neatly showing at the butt  of his ear, and he sitting on his haunches, calmly chewing his acorns,  oblivious of danger. He was the shortest-legged, blackest, and glossiest  bear I had ever seen; and such a fair shot. But I could not use either  skin or meat, and he was a splendid picture just as he sat. Shot down  and left to taint the blessed air, he would not look as wholesome, let  alone that it would be unwarrantable murder. And so, when he came nosing  under the very tree where I was sitting, I suddenly jumped up, threw my  hat at him, and gave a Comanche yell. He tumbled over in a limp heap,  grunting and whining for very terror, gathered himself up, got up  headway, and disappeared with wonderful speed--considering the length of  his legs.    On another occasion--and this was in heavy timber--I was resting on a  log, partially concealed by spice bushes, when I noticed a large flock  of turkeys coming in my direction. As they rapidly advanced with their  quick, gliding walk, the flock grew to a drove, the drove became a  swarm--an army. To right and on the left, as far as I could see in  front, a legion of turkeys were marching, steadily marching to the  eastward. Among them were some of the grandest gobblers I had ever seen,  and one magnificent fellow came straight toward me. Never before or  since have I seen such a splendid wild bird. His thick, glossy black  beard nearly reached the ground, his bronze uniform was of the richest,  and he was decidedly the largest I have ever seen. When within fifty  feet of the spot where I was nearly hidden, his wary eye caught  something suspicious; and he raised his superb head for an instant in an  attitude of motionless attention. Then, with lowered head and drooping  tail, he turned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34617"],[0,"The Jews of Barnow: Stories (#18)"],[1," wild laugh, showed them the child's body,  and then flung it out of the window on to the court beneath....    \"'I am a murderess,' she cried out to the Graf; 'yes, I am, I am. Take  me, bind me, kill me! I murdered my own child last night; I don't deny  it. You've come to fetch me; here I am!'    \"The men stared at her in speechless amazement.    \"Then came furious cries, shouts, and questions. Samuel, strong man as  he was, fainted away. The other Jews, at once perceiving the true state  of the case, and seeing no other way of saving the whole community from  certain death, supported her in her statement. Lea remained firm. The  Graf looked at her piercingly, and she returned his gaze without  flinching: 'Listen, woman,' he said; 'if you have really committed the  crime of which you have confessed yourself guilty, you shall die a death  of torture far more terrible than any one has ever yet suffered; but if  the other Jews killed the child in order to drink its blood at the  feast, you and your husband shall go unpunished, and the others shall  alone expiate their crime. I swear this by all that is holy!  Now--choose!'    \"Lea did not hesitate for a moment. 'It was my child,' she said.    \"The Graf had Lea taken to prison and confined in a solitary cell. He  quite saw all the improbability of her story, but he did not believe in  any greatness of soul in one of our people. 'If it were not true,' he  thought, 'why should the woman have given herself up?'    \"The trial threw no light upon the subject.    \"All the Jewish witnesses bore testimony against Lea. One told how she  had hated her child; another how she had threatened to kill it. Fear of  death forced these lies from their lips. The only Christian witness was  the black priest's housekeeper--the same woman who had gone to Samuel's  house on that fatal evening in the disguise of a peasant to bring  destruction on the Jewish community. She told how she had heard the  death rattle of the child during the night. She could not say more  without betraying herself, and so her story tallied with Lea's  confession. The 'black priest' took no apparent interest in the trial.  He probably thought that one victim would suffice for the time, or it  may be that he feared the discovery of his crime.    \"The Graf's judges pronounced Lea guilty, and condemned her to be broken  on the wheel in the market-place, and there beheaded. The wooden block  in front of the Dominican monastery was placed there for this purpose.    \"But Lea did not die on the scaffold; she died peacefully in her own  house forty years later, surrounded by her children and grandchildren;  for Austrian military law was proclaimed in the district before Graf  Bortynski's people had had time to execute the sentence pronounced upon  Lea, and an Austrian Government official, whose duty it was to try  criminal cases, examined the evidence against her. Samuel went to him  and told him the whole story, and he, after due inquiry, set Lea free.    \"The wooden block is still standing. It reminds us of the old dark days  of our oppression. But it also reminds us of the noble and heroic action  by which a weak woman saved the community....    \"And eighty years after that, my friends--eighty years after that--when  we were once more in danger of losing our lives, who was it that saved  us? Not a woman this time; but a timid little man whom no one could have  imagined capable of a courageous action, and whose name I have only to  mention to send you into a fit of laughter. It was little Mendele....  Ah, see now how you are chuckling! Well, well, I can't blame you, for he  is a very queer little man. He knows many a merry tale, and tells them  very amusingly. And then it is certainly a very strange thing to see a  gray-haired man no taller than a child, and with the ways and heart of a  child. He used to dance and sing all day long. I don't think that any  one ever saw him quiet. Even now he does not walk down a street, but  trots instead; he does not talk, but sings, and his hands seem to have  been given him for no other use but to beat time. But--what of that? It  is better to keep a cheerful heart than to wear a look of hypocritical  solemnity. Mendele Abenstern is a great singer, and we may well be proud  of having him for our _chazzan_ (deacon). It is true that he sometimes  rattles off a touching prayer as if it were a waltz, and that when  reading the Thorah he fidgets about from one leg to the other as if he  were a dancer at a theatre. But these little peculiarities of his never  interfere with our devotions, for we have been accustomed to Mendele and  his ways for the last forty years, and if any one happens to get  irritated with him now and then, he takes care not to vent it on the  manikin. He can not help remembering, you see, that little Mendele can  be grave enough at times, and that the poor _chazzan_ once did the town  greater service by his gift of song than all the wise and rich could  accomplish by their wisdom or their wealth.    \"I will tell you how that came to pass.    \"You know that a Jew is looked upon nowadays as a man like every one  else; and that if any noble or peasant dares to strike or oppress a Jew,  the latter can at once bring his assailant before the Austrian district  judge at the court-hall, and Herr von Negrusz punishes the offender for  his injustice. But before the great year when the Emperor proclaimed  that all men had equal rights, it was not so. In those old days, the  lord of the manor exercised justice within the bounds of his territory  by means of his agent; but what was called justice by these men was  generally great injustice. Ah, my friends, those were hard times! The  land belonged to the lord of the manor, and so did all the people who  lived on it; and the very air and water were his also. It was not only  in the villages that this was the case, but in the towns too, especially  when they belonged to a noble, and when their inhabitants were Jews. The  noble was lord of all, and ruled over his subjects through his agent or  _mandatar_.    \"At least it was so with us in Barnow. Our master, Graf Bortynski, lived  in Paris all the year round, and gave himself no trouble about his  estates or their management. His agent was supreme in Barnow, and was to  all intents and purposes our master. So we always used to pray that the  _mandatar_ might be a good man, who would allow us to live in peace and  quietness. And at first God answered our prayers, for stout old Herr  Stephan Grudza was as easy-tempered a man as we Jews could have desired.  It's true that he used to drink from morning till night, but he was  always good-natured in his cups, and would not for the world have made  any one miserable when he was merry. But one day, after making a  particularly good dinner, he was seized with apoplexy and died. The  whole district mourned for him, and so did we Jews of Barnow. For, in  the first place, Herr Grudza had been kind to every one; and in the  second--who knew what his successor would be like!    \"Our fears were well grounded.    \"The new _mandatar_, Friedrich Wollmann, was a German. Now the Germans  had hitherto treated us less harshly than the Poles. The new agent,  however, was an exception to this rule. He was a tall, thin man, with  black hair and bright black eyes. His expression was stern and  sad--always, always--no one ever saw him smile. He was a good manager,  and soon got the estate into order; he also insisted on the laws being  obeyed; taught evil-doers that he was not a man to be trifled with; and  I am quite sure that no one with whom he had any dealings defrauded him  of a halfpenny. But he hated us Jews with a deadly hatred, and did us  all as much harm as he could. He increased our taxes threefold--sent our  sons away to be soldiers--disturbed our feasts--and whenever we had a  lawsuit with a Christian, the Christian's word was always taken, while  ours was disbelieved. He was very hard upon the peasants too--in fact,  they said that no other agent at Barnow had ever been known to exact the  _robot_ due from the villein to his lord with so much severity, and yet  in that matter he acted within the letter of the law; and so there was a  sort of justice in his mode of procedure. But as soon as he had anything  to do with a Jew, he forgot both reason and justice.    \"Why did he persecute us so vehemently? No one knew for certain, but we  all guessed. It was said that he used to be called Troim Wollmann, and  that he was a Christianized Jew from Posen; that he had forsworn his  religion from love for a Christian girl, and that the Jews of his native  place had persecuted and calumniated him so terribly in consequence of  his apostasy, that the girl's parents had broken off their daughter's  engagement to him. I do not know who told us this, but no one could deny  the probability of the story who ever had looked him in the face, or had  watched the mode of treating us.    \"So our days were sad and full of foreboding for the future. Wollmann  oppressed and squeezed us whether we owed him money or not, and none  that displeased him had a chance of escape. Thus matters stood in the  autumn before the great year.    \"It isn't the pleasantest thing in the world for a Jew to be an Austrian  soldier, but if one of our race is sent into the Russian service his  fate is worse than death. He is thenceforward lost to God, to his  parents, and to himself. Is it, then, a matter for surprise that the  Russian Jews should gladly spend their last penny to buy their  children's freedom from military service, or that any youth, whose  people are too poor to ransom him, should fly over the border to escape  his fate? Many such cases are known: some of the fugitives are caught  before they have crossed the frontiers of Russia, and it would have been  better for them if they had never been born; but some make good their  escape into Moldavia, or into our part of"]]]
