Dreams, and the interpretation of dreams, have opened the future,  pointed out the course of empire through all the troublous times of  successive ages, till Saints alone shall rule, and immortality alone  endure.    Oh, what a doleful situation was Saul the king of Israel placed in,  when the army of the Philistines stood in battle array against him,  and the Lord answered him not, either by dream, by Prophet, by vision,  or by Urim and Thummim!    He sought the unlawful gift of familiar spirits, or \"Magnetism.\" He  there learned his doom, and rushed to battle with the desperation of  hopeless despair.    Himself, his sons, and the hosts of Israel, fell in battle in that  awful day; while David, to whom these gifts had been transferred by  the ordination and holy anointing of Samuel, arose by their use to the  throne of Israel.    A dream announced to Joseph that his virgin wife should have a son. A  dream forewarned him to flee into Egypt with the young child and his  mother. A dream announced to him in Egypt the death of Herod, and  warned him to return to his native land.    A dream warned the wise men from the east to return home another way,  and not return to Herod to betray the young child.    Dreams and visions warned Paul, and the Apostles, and the Saints of  his day, of various dangers, shipwrecks, persecutions and deaths, and  pointed out the means of escape.    Dreams and visions attended and guided them, more or less, in their  whole ministry and sojourn on the earth.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE WORLD OF SPIRITS.          Ye worlds of light and life, beyond our sphere;      Mysterious country! let your light appear.      Ye angels, lift the vail, the truth unfold,      And give our Seers a glimpse of that bright world;      Tell where ye live, and what are your employ,      Your present blessing, and your future joy.      Say, have you learn'd the name, and tun'd the lyre,      And hymn'd the praise of him--the great Messiah?      Have love's emotions kindl'd in your breast,      And hope enraptur'd seiz'd the promis'd rest?      Or wait ye still the resurrection day,      That higher promise of Millennial sway?      When Saints and angels come to earth again,      And in the Mesh with King Messiah reign?      The spirits answer'd as they soar'd away--      \"We're happy now, but wait a greater day,      When sin and death, and hell, shall conquer'd be,      And _earth_, with heaven, enjoy the victory.\"    The spirit of man consists of an organization, or embodiment of the  elements of spiritual matter, in the likeness and after the pattern of  the fleshly tabernacle. It possesses, in fact, all the organs and  parts exactly corresponding to the outward tabernacle.    The entrance of this spirit into its embryo tabernacle of flesh, is  called quickening. The infallible evidence of its presence is  voluntary motion, which implies a degree of independent agency, or  inherent will, which individual identity alone possesses.    When this spirit departs, the outward tabernacle is said to be dead,  that is, the individual who quickened and imparted voluntary motion to  the said tabernacle is no longer there. This individual, on departing  from its earthly house, repasses the dark vale of forgetfulness, and  awakes in the spirit world.    The spirit world is not the heaven where Jesus Christ, his Father, and  other beings dwell, who have, by resurrection or translation, ascended  to eternal mansions, and been crowned and seated on thrones of power;  but it is an intermediate state, a probation, a place of preparation,  improvement, instruction, or education, where spirits are chastened  and improved, and where, if found worthy, they may be taught a  knowledge of the Gospel. In short, it is a place where the Gospel is  preached, and where faith, repentance, hope and charity may be  exercised; a place of waiting for the resurrection or redemption of  the body; while, to those who deserve it, it is a place of punishment,  a purgatory or hell, where spirits are buffetted till the day of  redemption.    As to its location, it is here on the very planet where we were born;  or, in other words, the earth and other planets of a like sphere, have  their inward or spiritual spheres, as well as their outward, or  temporal. The one is peopled by temporal tabernacles, and the other by  spirits. A vail is drawn between the one sphere and the other, whereby  all the objects in the spiritual sphere are rendered invisible to  those in the temporal.    To discern beings or things in the spirit world, a person in the flesh  must be quickened by spiritual element, the vail must be withdrawn, or  the organs of sight, or of hearing, must be transformed, so as to be  adapted to the spiritual sphere. This state is called vision, trance,  second sight, clairvoyance, &c.    The elements and beings in the spirit world are as real and tangible  to spiritual organs, as things and beings of the temporal world are to  beings of a temporal state.    In this spirit world there are all the varieties and grades of  intellectual being, which exist in the present world. For instance,  Jesus Christ and the thief on the cross, both went to the same place,  and found themselves associated in the spirit world.    But the one was there in all the intelligence, happiness, benevolence,  and charity, which characterized a teacher, a messenger, anointed to  preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to  comfort those who mourned, to preach deliverance to the captive, and  open the prison to those who were bound; or, in other words, _To  preach the Gospel to the spirits in prison, that they might he judged  according to men in the flesh_; while the other was there as a thief,  who had expired on the cross for crime, and who was guilty, ignorant,  uncultivated, and unprepared for resurrection, having need of  remission of sins, and to be instructed in the science of salvation.    The former bid farewell to the world of spirits on the third day, and  returned to his tabernacle of flesh, in which he ascended to thrones,  principalities, and powers, while the latter is, no doubt, improving  in the spirit world, and waiting, believing, hoping for the redemption  of the body.    In the world of spirits there are Apostles, Prophets, Elders, and  members of the Church of the Saints, holding keys of Priesthood, and  power to teach, comfort, instruct, and proclaim the Gospel to, their  fellow-spirits, after the pattern of Jesus Christ.    In the same world there are also the spirits of Catholics, and  Protestants of every sect, who have all need to be taught, and to come  to the knowledge of the true, unchangeable Gospel, in its fulness and  simplicity, that they may be judged the same as if they had been  privileged with the same in the flesh.    There is also the Jew, the Mahometan, the infidel, who did not believe  in Christ while in the flesh. All these must be taught, must come to  the knowledge of the crucified and risen Redeemer, and hear the glad  tidings of the Gospel.    There are also all the varieties of the heathen spirits; the noble and  refined philosopher, poet, patriot, or statesman of Rome or Greece;  the enlightened Socrates, Plato, and their like; together with every  grade of spirits, down to the most uncultivated of the savage world.    All these must be taught, enlightened, and must bow the knee to the  eternal king, for the decree hath gone forth, that unto him every knee  shall bow and every tongue confess.    O what a field of labour, of benevolence, of missionary enterprise now  opens to the Apostles and Elders of the Church of the Saints! As this  field opens they will begin to realize more fully the extent of their  divine mission, and the meaning of the great command to \"_Preach the  Gospel to every creature_.\"    In this vast field of labour, the Priesthood are, in a great measure,  occupied, during their sojourn in the world of spirits while awaiting  the resurrection of the body; and at the same time they themselves are  edified, improved, and greatly advanced and matured in the science of  divine Theology.    In the use of the keys of this science, by them administered, and in  connexion with the ministration of certain ordinances, by the  Priesthood in this mortal life, for, and in behalf of, those who are  dead, the doors of the prisons of the spirit world are opened, and  their gloomy dungeons made radiant with light. Hope then springs  afresh. Joy and gladness swell the bosom accustomed to anguish, and  smiles assume the place of tears, while songs of triumph, and the  voice of melody and thanksgiving occupy the hearts, and flow from the  lips, of those who have long dwelt in darkness, and in the region and  shadow of death.    The times of sojourn of a spirit in the world of spirits, and also its  privileges and degrees of enjoyment, or of suffering, while there,  depend much on its preparations while in the flesh.    For instance, the people swept off by the flood of Noah, were  imprisoned in the world of spirits, in a kind of hell; without  justification, without Priesthood or Gospel, without the true  knowledge of God, or a hope of resurrection, during those long ages  which intervened between the flood and the death of Christ. It was  only by the personal ministry of the spirit of Jesus Christ, during  his sojourn in the spirit world, that they were at length privileged  to hear the Gospel, and to act upon their own agency, the same as men  in the flesh; whereas, if they had repented at the preaching of Noah,  they might have been justified, and filled with the hope and knowledge  of the resurrection while in the flesh.

Not the least attractive feature in the study of these animals, is the  mode of catching them. We will suppose it to be a warm, still morning  at Nahant, in the last week of August, with a breath of autumn in the  haze that softens the outlines of the opposite shore, and makes the  horizon line a little dim. It is about eleven o'clock, for few of the  Jelly-fishes are early risers; they like the warm sun, and at an  earlier hour they are not to be found very near the surface. The sea  is white and glassy, with a slight swell but no ripple, and seems  almost motionless as we put off in a dory from the beach near  Saunders's Ledge. We are provided with two buckets, one for the larger  Jelly-fishes, the Zygodactyla, Aurelia, &c., the other for the smaller  fry, such as the various kinds of Ctenophorae, the Tima, Melicertum,  &c. Beside these, we have two nets and glass bowls, in which to take  up the more fragile creatures that cannot bear rough handling. A bump  or two on the stones before we are fairly launched, a shove of the oar  to keep the boat well out from the rocks along which we skirt for a  moment, and now we are off. We pull around the point to our left and  turn toward the Ledge, filling our buckets as we go. Now we are  crossing the shallows that make the channel between the inner and  outer rocks of Saunders's Ledge. Look down,--how clear the water is  and how lovely the sea-weeds, above which we are floating, dark brown  and purple fronds of the Ulvae, and the long blades of the Laminaria  with mossy green tufts between. As we issue from this narrow passage  we must be on the watch, for the tide is rising, and may come laden  with treasures, as it sweeps through it. A sudden cry from the oarsman  at the bow, not of rocks or breakers ahead, but of \"A new Jelly-fish  astern!\" The quick eye of the naturalist of the party pronounces it  unknown to zoologists, un-described by any scientific pen. Now what  excitement! \"Out with the net!--we have passed him! he has gone down!  no, there he is again! back us a bit.\" Here he is floating close by  us; now he is within the circle of the net, but he is too delicate to  be caught safely in that way, so, while one of us moves the net gently  about, to keep him within the space enclosed by it, another slips the  glass bowl under him, lifts it quickly, and there is a general  exclamation of triumph and delight,--we have him. And now we look more  closely; yes, decidedly he is a novelty as well as a beauty. (See Fig.  122, _Ptychogena lactea_ A. Ag.) Those white mossy tufts for ovaries  are unlike anything we have found before (Fig. 123), and not  represented in any published figures of Jelly-fishes. We float about  here for a while, hoping to find more of the same kind, but no others  make their appearance, and we keep on our way to East Point, where  there is a capital fishing ground for Medusae of all sorts. Here two  currents meet, and the Jelly-fishes are stranded as it were along the  line of juncture, able to move neither one way nor the other. At this  spot the sea actually swarms with life; one cannot dip the net into  the water without bringing up Pleurobrachia, Bolina, Idyia,  Melicertum, &c., while the larger Zygodactyla and Aurelia float about  the boat in numbers. These large Jelly-fishes produce a singular  effect as one sees them at some depth beneath the water; the Aureliae,  especially, with their large white disks, look like pale phantoms  wandering about far below the surface; but they constantly float  upward, and if not too far out of reach, one may bring them up by  stirring the water under them with the end of the oar.        [Illustration: Fig. 122. Ptychogena, natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 123. Ovary of Ptychogena; magnified.]    When we have passed an hour or so floating about just beyond East  Point, and have nearly filled our buckets with Jelly-fishes of all  sizes and descriptions, we turn and row homeward. The buckets look  very pretty as they stand in the bottom of the boat with the sunshine  lighting up their living contents. The Idyia glitters and sparkles  with ever-changing hues, the Pleurobrachiae dart about, trailing their  long graceful tentacles after them, the golden Melicerta are kept in  constant motion by their quick, sudden contractions, and the delicate  transparent Tima floats among them all, not the less beautiful because  so colorless. There is an unfortunate Idyia, who, by some mistake, has  got into the wrong bucket with the larger Jelly-fish, where a  Zygodactyla has entangled it among his tentacles and is quietly  breakfasting upon it.    During our row the tide has been rising, and as we near the channel of  Saunders's Ledge, it is running through more strongly than before, and  at the entrance of the shallows a pleasant surprise is prepared us; no  less than half a dozen of our new friends (the Ptychogena as he has  been baptized), come to look for their lost companion perhaps, await  us there, and are presently added to our spoils. We reach the shore  heavily laden with the fruits of our morning's excursion.    The most interesting part of the work for the naturalist is still to  come. On our return to the Laboratory, the contents of the buckets are  poured into separate glass bowls and jars; holding them up against the  light, we can see which are our best and rarest specimens; these we  dip out in glass cups and place by themselves. If any small specimens  are swimming about at the bottom of the jar, and refuse to come within  our reach, there is a very simple mode of catching them. Dip a glass  tube into the water, keeping the upper end closed with your finger,  and sink it till the lower end is just above the animal you want to  entrap; then lift your finger, and as the air rushes out the water  rushes in, bringing with it the little creature you are trying to  catch. When the specimens are well assorted, the microscope is taken  out, and the rest of the day is spent in studying the new  Jelly-fishes, recording the results, making notes, drawings, &c.    Still more attractive than the rows by day are the night expeditions  in search of Jelly-fishes. For this object we must choose a quiet  night, for they will not come to the surface if the water is troubled.  Nature has her culminating hours, and she brings us now and then a day  or night on which she seems to have lavished all her treasures. It was  on such a rare evening, at the close of the summer of 1862, that we  rowed over the same course by Saunders's Ledge and East Point  described above. The August moon was at her full, the sky was without  a cloud, and we floated on a silver sea; pale streamers of the aurora  quivered in the north, and notwithstanding the brilliancy of the moon,  they too cast their faint reflection in the ocean. We rowed quietly  along past the Ledge, past Castle Rock, the still surface of the water  unbroken, except by the dip of the oars and the ripple of the boat,  till we reached the line off East Point, where the Jelly-fishes are  always most abundant, if they are to be found at all. Now dip the net  into the water. What genie under the sea has wrought this wonderful  change? Our dirty, torn old net is suddenly turned to a web of gold,  and as we lift it from the water heavy rills of molten metal seem to  flow down its sides and collect in a glowing mass at the bottom. The  truth is, the Jelly-fishes, so sparkling and brilliant in the  sunshine, have a still lovelier light of their own at night; they give  out a greenish golden light as brilliant as that of the brightest  glow-worm, and on a calm summer night, at the spawning season, when  they come to the surface in swarms, if you do but dip your hand into  the water it breaks into sparkling drops beneath your touch. There are  no more beautiful phosphorescent animals in the sea than the Medusae;  it would seem that the expression, \"rills of molten metal\" could  hardly apply to anything so impalpable as a Jelly-fish, but, although  so delicate in structure, their gelatinous disks give them a weight  and substance; and at night, when their transparency is not perceived,  and their whole mass is aglow with phosphorescent light, they truly  have an appearance of solidity which is most striking, when they are  lifted out of the water and flow down the sides of the net.    The various kinds present very different aspects; wherever the larger  Aureliae and Zygodactylae float to the surface, they bring with them a  dim spreading halo of light, the smaller Ctenophorae become little  shining spheres, while a thousand lesser creatures add their tiny  lamps to the illumination of the ocean; for this so-called  phosphorescence of the sea is by no means due to the Jelly-fishes  alone, but is also produced by many other animals, differing in the  color as well as the intensity of their light, and it is a curious  fact that they seem to take possession of the field by turns. You may  row over the same course, which a few nights since glowed with a  greenish golden light wherever the surface of the water was disturbed,  and though equally brilliant, the phosphorescence has now a pure white  light. On such an evening, be quite sure that when you empty your  buckets on your return and examine their contents you will find that  the larger part of your treasures are small crustacea (little  shrimps). Of course there will be other phosphorescent creatures,  Jelly-fishes, &c., among them, but the predominant color is given by  these little crustacea. On another evening the light will have a  bluish tint, and then the phosphorescence is principally due to the  Dysmorphosa (Fig. 105).    Notwithstanding the beauty of a moonlight row, if you would see the  phosphorescence to greatest advantage you must choose a dark night,  when the motion of your boat sets the sea on fire around you, and a "]]]
