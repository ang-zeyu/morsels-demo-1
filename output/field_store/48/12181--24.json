ESCENA PRIMERA                          SCENE I    (Brígida, Ciutti)                       (Brígida, Ciutti)    BRÍGIDA: ¡Qué noche, válgame Dios!      My God what a night!  A poderlo calcular                      Had I foreseen it,  no me meto yo a servir                  I wouldn't have offered to serve  a tan fogoso galán.                     such a fiery young man as this.  ¡Ay, Ciutti! Molida estoy;              Ah Ciutti! I'm battered and bruised  no me puedo menear.                     and I can't move a muscle.    CIUTTI: Pues ¿qué os duele ?            But what pains you?    BRÍGIDA: Todo el cuerpo                 My whole body,  y toda el alma además.                  and all my soul besides.    CIUTTI: ¡Ya! No estáis acostumbrada     Ah, you're just not used  al caballo, es natural.                 to riding, it's natural.    BRÍGIDA: Mil veces pensé caer:          I thought I'd fall a thousand times.  ¡uf!, ¡qué mareo!, ¡qué afán!           Oh! What dizziness! What fear!  Veía yo unos tras otros                 I saw the trees one after another  ante mis ojos pasar                     passing before my eyes  los árboles, como en alas               as if on wings, blown by  llevados de un huracán,                 so quickly in a storm  tan apriesa y produciéndome             that they produced in me  ilusión tan infernal,                   such a hellish illusion  que perdiera los sentidos               that had we delayed our halt  si tardamos en parar.                   much longer, I'd have lost my                                          senses.    CIUTTI: Pues de estas cosas veréis,     But you'll see things of this sort  si en esta casa os quedáis,             if you stay in this house  lo menos seis por semana.               at least six times a week.    BRÍGIDA: ¡Jesús!                        Good God!    CIUTTI: ¿Y esa niña está                And is that little girl  reposando todavía?                      still resting?    BRÍGIDA: ¿Y a qué se ha de              And why should she wake?  despertar?    CIUTTI: Sí, es mejor que abra los       Yes, it's better she opens her eyes  ojos  en los brazos de don Juan.              in the arms of Don Juan.    BRÍGIDA: Preciso es que tu amo tenga    Your master must have  algún diablo familiar.                  some devil as his familiar.    CIUTTI: Yo creo que sea él mismo        I think that he himself is  un diablo en carne mortal,              a devil in mortal flesh,  porque a lo que él, solamente           because only Satan would  se arrojara Satanás.                    dare to do what he does.    BRÍGIDA:  ¡Oh! ¡El lance ha sido extremado!       Ah! The deed was amazing.    CIUTTI: Pero al fin logrado está.       But it is finally done.    BRÍGIDA: ¡Salir así de un convento      To take her from a convent  en medio de una ciudad                  in the middle of a place  como Sevilla!                           like Seville!    CIUTTI: Es empresa                      It's an undertaking  tan sólo para hombre tal.               fit only for such a man.  Mas, ¡qué diablos!, si a su lado        But, devil take it, it's as if  la fortuna siempre va,                  fortune is always with him,  encadenado a sus pies                   chained at his feet  duerme sumiso el azar.                  while chance sleeps in submission.    BRÍGIDA: Si, decís bien.                Yes, you speak well.    CIUTTI: No he visto hombre              I have never seen a man  de corazón más audaz;                   with a more audacious heart  ni halla riesgo que le espante          who never finds a risk he fears  ni encuentra dificultad                 nor finds a single problem  que al empeñarse en vencer              he'll not attempt to vanquish  le haga un punto vacilar.               or that makes him halt a moment.  A todo osado se arroja,                 He attempts everything with daring  de todo se ve capaz,                    thinks himself in control of all things  ni mira dónde se mete,                  neither cares where he gets involved  ni lo pregunta jamás.                   nor even questions the reason for it.  \"Allí hay un lance\", le dicen;          They tell him  \"there's an affair\"  y él dice: \"Allá va don Juan\".          And he says:  \"Don Juan goes there.\"  ¡Mas ya tarda, vive Dios!               But Lord, it's getting late.    BRÍGIDA: Las doce en la catedral        A while ago it struck  han dado ha tiempo.                     twelve in the cathedral.    CIUTTI: Y de vuelta                     And he was supposed  debía a las doce estar.                 to be back at twelve.    BRÍGIDA: Pero ¿por qué no se vino       But why didn't he come  con nosotros?                           with us?    CIUTTI: Tiene allá,                     He still has a few things there  en la ciudad, todavía                   in the city  cuatro cosas que arreglar.              to arrange.    BRÍGIDA: ¿Para el viaje?                For the trip?    CIUTTI: Por supuesto;                   Of course;  aunque muy fácil será                   though it would be all too easy  que esta noche a los infernos           for them to have him travel  le hagan a él mismo viajar.             straight to Hell tonight.    BRÍGIDA: ¡Jesús, qué ideas!             Heavens, what ideas!    CIUTTI: Pues digo,                      Well I say  son obras de caridad                    these are works of charity  en las que nos empleamos                on which we are engaged  para mejor esperar.                     while awaiting something better.  Aunque seguros estamos                  Even so we'll be safe  como vuelva por acá.                    provided he returns here.    BRÍGIDA: ¿De veras, Ciutti?             Truly Ciutti?    CIUTTI: Venid                           Come  a este balcón y mirad.                  to this balcony and look.  ¿Qué veis?                              What do you see?    BRÍGIDA: Veo un bergantín               I see a boat  que anclado en el río está.             anchored in the river.    CIUTTI: Pues su patrón sólo aguarda     Well its owner only waits for  las órdenes de don Juan,                the orders of Don Juan.  y salvos en todo caso                   and in any case it will take us  a Italia nos llevará.                   safely to Italy.    BRÍGIDA: ¿Cierto?                       Are you sure?    CIUTTI: Y nada receléis                 And fear nothing  por nuestra seguridad;                  for our safety;  que es el barco más velero              since it's the swiftest ship  que boga sobre la mar.                  that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5210"],[0,"The Borough (#18)"],[1,"the tender dame  Invites to town, and gives their beauty Fame;  The grateful sisters feel th' important aid,  And the good Aunt is flatter'd and repaid.     What, though it may some cool observers strike,  That such fair sisters should be so unlike;  That still another and another comes,  And at the matron's tables smiles and blooms;  That all appear as if they meant to stay  Time undefined, nor name a parting day;  And yet, though all are valued, all are dear,  Causeless, they go, and seldom more appear.     Yet let Suspicion hide her odious head,  And Scandal vengeance from a burgess dread;  A pious friend, who with the ancient dame  At sober cribbage takes an evening game;  His cup beside him, through their play he quaffs,  And oft renews, and innocently laughs;  Or growing serious, to the text resorts,  And from the Sunday-sermon makes reports;  While all, with grateful glee, his wish attend,  A grave protector and a powerful friend:  But Slander says, who indistinctly sees,  Once he was caught with Sylvia on his knees; -  A cautious burgess with a careful wife  To be so caught!--'tis false, upon my life.     Next are a lower kind, yet not so low  But they, among them, their distinctions know;  And when a thriving landlord aims so high,  As to exchange the Chequer for the Pye,  Or from Duke William to the Dog repairs,  He takes a finer coat and fiercer airs.     Pleased with his power, the poor man loves to say  What favourite Inn shall share his evening's pay;  Where he shall sit the social hour, and lose  His past day's labours and his next day's views.  Our Seamen too have choice; one takes a trip  In the warm cabin of his favourite Ship;  And on the morrow in the humbler Boat  He rows till fancy feels herself afloat;  Can he the sign--Three Jolly Sailors--pass,  Who hears a fiddle and who sees a lass?  The Anchor too affords the seaman joys,  In small smoked room, all clamour, crowd, and noise;  Where a curved settle half surrounds the fire,  Where fifty voices purl and punch require;  They come for pleasure in their leisure hour,  And they enjoy it to their utmost power;  Standing they drink, they swearing smoke, while all  Call, or make ready for a second call:  There is no time for trifling--\"Do ye see?  We drink and drub the French extempore.\"     See! round the room, on every beam and balk,  Are mingled scrolls of hieroglyphic chalk;  Yet nothing heeded--would one stroke suffice  To blot out all, here honour is too nice, -  \"Let knavish landsmen think such dirty things,  We're British tars, and British tars are kings.\"     But the Green-Man shall I pass by unsung,  Which mine own James upon his sign-post hung?  His sign his image,--for he was once seen  A squire's attendant, clad in keeper's green;  Ere yet, with wages more and honour less,  He stood behind me in a graver dress.     James in an evil hour went forth to woo  Young Juliet Hart, and was her Romeo:  They'd seen the play, and thought it vastly sweet  For two young lovers by the moon to meet;  The nymph was gentle, of her favours free,  E'en at a word--no Rosalind was she;  Nor, like that other Juliet, tried his truth  With--\"Be thy purpose marriage, gentle youth?\"  But him received, and heard his tender tale,  When sang the lark, and when the nightingale;  So in few months the generous lass was seen  I' the way that all the Capulets had been.     Then first repentance seized the amorous man,  And--shame on love!--he reason'd and he ran;  The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse,  And the sad sounds, \"for better and for worse.\"     Yet could the Lover not so far withdraw,  But he was haunted both by Love and Law;  Now Law dismay'd him as he view'd its fangs,  Now Pity seized him for his Juliet's pangs;  Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail,  Where all would blame him, and where none might bail;  These drew him back, till Juliet's hut appear'd,  Where love had drawn him when he should have fear'd.     There sat the father in his wicker throne,  Uttering his curses in tremendous tone:  With foulest names his daughter he reviled,  And look'd a very Herod at the child:  Nor was she patient, but with equal scorn,  Bade him remember when his Joe was born:  Then rose the mother, eager to begin  Her plea for frailty, when the swain came in.     To him she turn'd, and other theme began,  Show'd him his boy, and bade him be a man;  \"An honest man, who, when he breaks the laws,  Will make a woman honest if there's cause.\"  With lengthen'd speech she proved what came to pass  Was no reflection on a loving lass:  \"If she your love as wife and mother claim,  What can it matter which was first the name?  But 'tis most base, 'tis perjury and theft,  When a lost girl is like a widow left;  The rogue who ruins .. \" here the father found  His spouse was treading on forbidden ground.     \"That's not the point,\" quoth he, \"I don't suppose  My good friend Fletcher to be one of those;  What's done amiss he'll mend in proper time -  I hate to hear of villany and crime:  'Twas my misfortune, in the days of youth,  To find two lasses pleading for my truth;  The case was hard, I would with all my soul  Have wedded both, but law is our control;  So one I took, and when we gain'd a home,  Her friend agreed--what could she more?--to come;  And when she found that I'd a widow'd bed,  Me she desired--what could I less?--to wed.  An easier case is yours:  you've not the smart  That two fond pleaders cause in one man's heart.  You've not to wait from year to year distress'd,  Before your conscience can be laid at rest;  There smiles your bride, there sprawls your new-born son,  A ring, a licence, and the thing is done.\" -     \"My loving James,\"--the Lass began her plea,  I'll make thy reason take a part with me;  Had I been froward, skittish, or unkind,  Or to thy person or thy passion blind;  Had I refused, when 'twas thy part to pray,  Or put thee off with promise and delay;  Thou might'st in justice and in conscience fly,  Denying her who taught thee to deny:  But, James, with me thou hadst an easier task,  Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask;  I laid no traps for thee, no plots or plans,  Nor marriage named by licence or by banns;  Nor would I now the parson's aid employ,  But for this cause,\"--and up she held her boy.     Motives like these could heart of flesh resist?  James took the infant and in triumph kiss'd;  Then to his mother's arms the child restored,  Made his proud speech and pledged his worthy word.     \"Three times at church our banns shall publish'd be,  Thy health be drunk in bumpers three times three;  And thou shalt grace (bedeck'd in garments gay)  The christening-dinner on the wedding-day.\"     James at my door then made his parting bow,  Took the Green-Man, and is a master now.        LETTER XII.        These are monarchs none respect,  Heroes, yet an humbled crew,  Nobles, whom the crowd correct,  Wealthy men, whom duns pursue;  Beauties shrinking from the view  Of the day's detecting eye;  Lovers, who with much ado  Long-forsaken damsels woo,  And heave the ill-feign'd sigh.    These are misers, craving means  Of existence through the day,  Famous scholars, conning scenes  Of a dull bewildering play;  Ragged beaux and misses gray,  Whom the rabble praise and blame,  Proud and mean, and sad and gay,  Toiling after ease, are they,  Infamous, and boasting fame.             ----------------    PLAYERS.    They arrive in the Borough--Welcomed by their former Friends--Are  better fitted for Comic than Tragic Scenes:  yet better approved in  the latter by one Part of their Audience--Their general Character  and Pleasantry--Particular Distresses and Labours--Their Fortitude  and Patience--A private rehearsal--The Vanity of the aged Actress--A  Heroine from the Milliner's Shop--A deluded Tradesman--Of what  Persons the Company is composed--Character and Adventures of  Frederick Thompson.    DRAWN by the annual call, we now behold  Our Troop Dramatic, heroes known of old,  And those, since last they march'd, enlisted and enrolled:  Mounted on hacks or borne in waggons some,  The rest on foot (the humbler brethren) come.  Three favour'd places, an unequal time,  Join to support this company sublime:  Ours for the longer period--see how light  Yon parties move, their former friends in sight,  Whose claims are all allow'd, and friendship glads the night.  Now public rooms shall sound with words divine,  And private lodgings hear how heroes shine;  No talk of pay shall yet on pleasure steal,  But kindest welcome bless the friendly meal;  While o'er the social jug and decent cheer,  Shall be described the fortunes of the year.     Peruse these bills, and see what each can do, -  Behold! the prince, the slave, the monk, the Jew;  Change but the garment, and they'll all engage  To take each part, and act in every age:  Cull'd from all houses, what a house are they!  Swept from all barns, our Borough-critics say;  But with some portion of a critic's ire,  We all endure them; there are some admire:  They might have praise, confined to farce alone;  Full well they grin, they should not try to groan;  But then our servants' and our seamen's wives  Love all that rant and rapture as their lives;  He who 'Squire Richard's part could well sustain,  Finds as King Richard he must roar amain -  \"My horse! my horse!\"--Lo! now to their abodes,  Come lords and lovers, empresses and gods.  The master-mover of these scenes has made  No trifling gain in this adventurous trade;  Trade we may term it, for he duly buys  Arms out of use and undirected eyes:  These he instructs, and guides them as he can,  And vends each night the manufactured man:  Long as our custom lasts they gladly stay,  Then strike their tents, like Tartars! and away!  The place grows bare where they too long remain,  But grass will rise ere they return again.     Children of Thespes, welcome; knights and queens!  Counts! barons! beauties! when before your scenes,  And mighty monarchs"]]]
