But experience does not offer an example  of so perfect a correlation. In the field of experience it will always  happen more or less that excess on the one side will give rise to  deficiency on the other, and deficiency will give birth to excess. It  results from this that what in the beau-ideal is only distinct in the  idea is different in reality in empirical beauty. The beau-ideal, though  simple and indivisible, discloses, when viewed in two different aspects,  on the one hand, a property of gentleness and grace, and on the other, an  energetic property; in experience there is a gentle and graceful beauty  and there is an energetic beauty. It is so, and it will be always so, so  long as the absolute is enclosed in the limits of time, and the ideas of  reason have to be realized in humanity. For example, the intellectual  man has the ideal of virtue, of truth, and of happiness; but the active  man will only practise virtues, will only grasp truths, and enjoy happy  days. The business of physical and moral education is to bring back this  multiplicity to unity, to put morality in the place of manners, science  in the place of knowledge; the business of aesthetic education is to make  out of beauties the beautiful.    Energetic beauty can no more preserve a man from a certain residue of  savage violence and harshness than graceful beauty can secure him against  a certain degree of effeminacy and weakness. As it is the effect of the  energetic beauty to elevate the mind in a physical and moral point of  view and to augment its momentum, it only too often happens that the  resistance of the temperament and of the character diminishes the  aptitude to receive impressions, that the delicate part of humanity  suffers an oppression which ought only to affect its grosser part, and  that this coarse nature participates in an increase of force that ought  only to turn to the account of free personality. It is for this reason  that, at the periods when we find much strength and abundant sap in  humanity, true greatness of thought is seen associated with what is  gigantic and extravagant, and the sublimest feeling is found coupled with  the most horrible excess of passion. It is also the reason why, in the  periods distinguished for regularity and form, nature is as often  oppressed as it is governed, as often outraged as it is surpassed. And  as the action of gentle and graceful beauty is to relax the mind in the  moral sphere as well as the physical, it happens quite as easily that the  energy of feelings is extinguished with the violence of desires, and that  character shares in the loss of strength which ought only to affect the  passions. This is the reason why, in ages assumed to be refined, it is  not a rare thing to see gentleness degenerate into effeminacy, politeness  into platitude, correctness into empty sterility, liberal ways into  arbitrary caprice, ease into frivolity, calm into apathy, and, lastly, a  most miserable caricature treads on the heels of the noblest, the most  beautiful type of humanity. Gentle and graceful beauty is therefore a  want to the man who suffers the constraint of manner and of forms, for he  is moved by grandeur and strength long before he becomes sensible to  harmony and grace. Energetic beauty is a necessity to the man who is  under the indulgent sway of taste, for in his state of refinement he is  only too much disposed to make light of the strength that he retained in  his state of rude savagism.    I think I have now answered and also cleared up the contradiction  commonly met in the judgments of men respecting the influence of the  beautiful, and the appreciation of aesthetic culture. This contradiction  is explained directly we remember that there are two sorts of  experimental beauty, and that on both hands an affirmation is extended to  the entire race, when it can only be proved of one of the species. This  contradiction disappears the moment we distinguish a twofold want in  humanity to which two kinds of beauty correspond. It is therefore  probable that both sides would make good their claims if they come to an  understanding respecting the kind of beauty and the form of humanity that  they have in view.    Consequently in the sequel of my researches I shall adopt the course that  nature herself follows with man considered from the point of view of  aesthetics, and setting out from the two kinds of beauty, I shall rise to  the idea of the genus. I shall examine the effects produced on man by  the gentle and graceful beauty when its springs of action are in full  play, and also those produced by energetic beauty when they are relaxed.  I shall do this to confound these two sorts of beauty in the unity of the  beau-ideal, in the same way that the two opposite forms and modes of  being of humanity are absorbed in the unity of the ideal man.          LETTER XVII.      While we were only engaged in deducing the universal idea of beauty from  the conception of human nature in general, we had only to consider in the  latter the limits established essentially in itself, and inseparable from  the notion of the finite. Without attending to the contingent  restrictions that human nature may undergo in the real world of  phenomena, we have drawn the conception of this nature directly from  reason, as a source of every necessity, and the ideal of beauty has been  given us at the same time with the ideal of humanity.    But now we are coming down from the region of ideas to the scene of  reality, to find man in a determinate state, and consequently in limits  which are not derived from the pure conception of humanity, but from  external circumstances and from an accidental use of his freedom. But,  although the limitation of the idea of humanity may be very manifold in  the individual, the contents of this idea suffice to teach us that we can  only depart from it by two opposite roads. For if the perfection of man  consist in the harmonious energy of his sensuous and spiritual forces, he  can only lack this perfection through the want of harmony and the want of  energy. Thus, then, before having received on this point the testimony  of experience, reason suffices to assure us that we shall find the real  and consequently limited man in a state of tension or relaxation,  according as the exclusive activity of isolated forces troubles the  harmony of his being, or as the unity of his nature is based on the  uniform relaxation of his physical and spiritual forces. These opposite  limits are, as we have now to prove, suppressed by the beautiful, which  re-establishes harmony in man when excited, and energy in man when  relaxed; and which, in this way, in conformity with the nature of the  beautiful, restores the state of limitation to an absolute state, and  makes of man a whole, complete in himself.    Thus the beautiful by no means belies in reality the idea which we have  made of it in speculation; only its action is much less free in it than  in the field of theory, where we were able to apply it to the pure  conception of humanity. In man, as experience shows him to us, the  beautiful finds a matter, already damaged and resisting, which robs him  in ideal perfection of what it communicates to him of its individual mode  of being. Accordingly in reality the beautiful will always appear a  peculiar and limited species, and not as the pure genus; in excited minds  in a state of tension it will lose its freedom and variety; in relaxed  minds, it will lose its vivifying force; but we, who have become familiar  with the true character of this contradictory phenomenon, cannot be led  astray by it. We shall not follow the great crowd of critics, in  determining their conception by separate experiences, and to make them  answerable for the deficiencies which man shows under their influence.  We know rather that it is man who transfers the imperfections of his  individuality over to them, who stands perpetually in the way of their  perfection by his subjective limitation, and lowers their absolute ideal  to two limited forms of phenomena.    It was advanced that soft beauty is for an unstrung mind, and the  energetic beauty for the tightly strung mind. But I apply the term  unstrung to a man when he is rather under the pressure of feelings than  under the pressure of conceptions. Every exclusive sway of one of his  two fundamental impulses is for man a state of compulsion and violence,  and freedom only exists in the co-operation of his two natures.  Accordingly, the man governed preponderately by feelings, or sensuously  unstrung, is emancipated and set free by matter. The soft and graceful  beauty, to satisfy this twofold problem, must therefore show herself  under two aspects--in two distinct forms. First, as a form in repose,  she will tone down savage life, and pave the way from feeling to thought.  She will, secondly, as a living image, equip the abstract form with  sensuous power, and lead back the conception to intuition and law to  feeling. The former service she does to the man of nature, the second to  the man of art. But because she does not in both cases hold complete  sway over her matter, but depends on that which is furnished either by  formless nature or unnatural art, she will in both cases bear traces of  her origin, and lose herself in one place in material life and in another  in mere abstract form.    To be able to arrive at a conception how beauty can become a means to  remove this twofold relaxation, we must explore its source in the human  mind. Accordingly, make up your mind to dwell a little longer in the  region of speculation, in order then to leave it forever, and to advance  with securer footing on the ground of experience.

By beauty the sensuous man is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#18)"],[1,"against an even  ordinary swordsman, but I was later to see the purpose of them and  with what wondrous dexterity the yellow men manipulate them.    One of the swords which each of the warriors carried caught  my immediate attention.  I call it a sword, but really it was a  sharp-edged blade with a complete hook at the far end.    The other sword was of about the same length as the hooked instrument,  and somewhere between that of my long-sword and my short-sword.  It was straight and two-edged.  In addition to the weapons I have  enumerated each man carried a dagger in his harness.    As the white-furred one approached, the six grasped their swords  more firmly--the hooked instrument in the left hand, the straight  sword in the right, while above the left wrist the small shield  was held rigid upon a metal bracelet.    As the lone warrior came opposite them the six rushed out upon him  with fiendish yells that resembled nothing more closely than the  savage war cry of the Apaches of the South-west.    Instantly the attacked drew both his swords, and as the six fell  upon him I witnessed as pretty fighting as one might care to see.    With their sharp hooks the combatants attempted to take hold of  an adversary, but like lightning the cupshaped shield would spring  before the darting weapon and into its hollow the hook would plunge.    Once the lone warrior caught an antagonist in the side with his  hook, and drawing him close ran his sword through him.    But the odds were too unequal, and, though he who fought alone was  by far the best and bravest of them all, I saw that it was but a  question of time before the remaining five would find an opening  through his marvelous guard and bring him down.    Now my sympathies have ever been with the weaker side of an argument,  and though I knew nothing of the cause of the trouble I could not  stand idly by and see a brave man butchered by superior numbers.    As a matter of fact I presume I gave little attention to seeking an  excuse, for I love a good fight too well to need any other reason  for joining in when one is afoot.    So it was that before Thuvan Dihn knew what I was about he saw me  standing by the side of the white-clad yellow man, battling like  mad with his five adversaries.          WITH THE YELLOW MEN      Thuvan Dihn was not long in joining me; and, though we found the  hooked weapon a strange and savage thing with which to deal, the  three of us soon despatched the five black-bearded warriors who  opposed us.    When the battle was over our new acquaintance turned to me, and  removing the shield from his wrist, held it out.  I did not know  the significance of his act, but judged that it was but a form of  expressing his gratitude to me.    I afterward learned that it symbolized the offering of a man's life  in return for some great favor done him; and my act of refusing,  which I had immediately done, was what was expected of me.    \"Then accept from Talu, Prince of Marentina,\" said the yellow man,  \"this token of my gratitude,\" and reaching beneath one of his wide  sleeves he withdrew a bracelet and placed it upon my arm.  He then  went through the same ceremony with Thuvan Dihn.    Next he asked our names, and from what land we hailed.  He seemed  quite familiar with the geography of the outerworld, and when I  said I was from Helium he raised his brows.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"you seek your ruler and his company?\"    \"Know you of them?\" I asked.    \"But little more than that they were captured by my uncle, Salensus  Oll, Jeddak of Jeddaks, Ruler of Okar, land of the yellow men of  Barsoom.  As to their fate I know nothing, for I am at war with my  uncle, who would crush my power in the principality of Marentina.    \"These from whom you have just saved me are warriors he has sent  out to find and slay me, for they know that often I come alone to  hunt and kill the sacred apt which Salensus Oll so much reveres.  It is partly because I hate his religion that Salensus Oll hates  me; but mostly does he fear my growing power and the great faction  which has arisen throughout Okar that would be glad to see me ruler  of Okar and Jeddak of Jeddaks in his place.    \"He is a cruel and tyrannous master whom all hate, and were it not  for the great fear they have of him I could raise an army overnight  that would wipe out the few that might remain loyal to him.  My  own people are faithful to me, and the little valley of Marentina  has paid no tribute to the court of Salensus Oll for a year.    \"Nor can he force us, for a dozen men may hold the narrow way to  Marentina against a million.  But now, as to thine own affairs.  How may I aid you?  My palace is at your disposal, if you wish to  honor me by coming to Marentina.\"    \"When our work is done we shall be glad to accept your invitation,\"  I replied.  \"But now you can assist us most by directing us to the  court of Salensus Oll, and suggesting some means by which we may  gain admission to the city and the palace, or whatever other place  we find our friends to be confined.\"    Talu gazed ruefully at our smooth faces and at Thuvan Dihn's red  skin and my white one.    \"First you must come to Marentina,\" he said, \"for a great change  must be wrought in your appearance before you can hope to enter  any city in Okar.  You must have yellow faces and black beards,  and your apparel and trappings must be those least likely to arouse  suspicion.  In my palace is one who can make you appear as truly  yellow men as does Salensus Oll himself.\"    His counsel seemed wise; and as there was apparently no other way  to insure a successful entry to Kadabra, the capital city of Okar,  we set out with Talu, Prince of Marentina, for his little, rock-bound  country.    The way was over some of the worst traveling I have ever seen, and  I do not wonder that in this land where there are neither thoats  nor fliers that Marentina is in little fear of invasion; but at  last we reached our destination, the first view of which I had from  a slight elevation a half-mile from the city.    Nestled in a deep valley lay a city of Martian concrete, whose  every street and plaza and open space was roofed with glass.  All  about lay snow and ice, but there was none upon the rounded,  domelike, crystal covering that enveloped the whole city.    Then I saw how these people combated the rigors of the arctic, and  lived in luxury and comfort in the midst of a land of perpetual  ice.  Their cities were veritable hothouses, and when I had come  within this one my respect and admiration for the scientific and  engineering skill of this buried nation was unbounded.    The moment we entered the city Talu threw off his outer garments  of fur, as did we, and I saw that his apparel differed but little  from that of the red races of Barsoom.  Except for his leathern  harness, covered thick with jewels and metal, he was naked, nor could  one have comfortably worn apparel in that warm and humid atmosphere.    For three days we remained the guests of Prince Talu, and during  that time he showered upon us every attention and courtesy within  his power.  He showed us all that was of interest in his great  city.    The Marentina atmosphere plant will maintain life indefinitely in  the cities of the north pole after all life upon the balance of  dying Mars is extinct through the failure of the air supply, should  the great central plant again cease functioning as it did upon that  memorable occasion that gave me the opportunity of restoring life  and happiness to the strange world that I had already learned to  love so well.    He showed us the heating system that stores the sun's rays in great  reservoirs beneath the city, and how little is necessary to maintain  the perpetual summer heat of the glorious garden spot within this  arctic paradise.    Broad avenues of sod sewn with the seed of the ocher vegetation  of the dead sea bottoms carried the noiseless traffic of light and  airy ground fliers that are the only form of artificial transportation  used north of the gigantic ice-barrier.    The broad tires of these unique fliers are but rubber-like gas bags  filled with the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion--that  remarkable discovery of the Martians that has made possible the  great fleets of mighty airships that render the red man of the  outer world supreme.  It is this ray which propels the inherent  or reflected light of the planet off into space, and when confined  gives to the Martian craft their airy buoyancy.    The ground fliers of Marentina contain just sufficient buoyancy in  their automobile-like wheels to give the cars traction for steering  purposes; and though the hind wheels are geared to the engine, and  aid in driving the machine, the bulk of this work is carried by a  small propeller at the stern.    I know of no more delightful sensation than that of riding in one  of these luxuriously appointed cars which skim, light and airy as  feathers, along the soft, mossy avenues of Marentina.  They move  with absolute noiselessness between borders of crimson sward and  beneath arching trees gorgeous with the wondrous blooms that mark  so many of the highly cultivated varieties of Barsoomian vegetation.    By the end of the third day the court barber--I can think of no  other earthly appellation by which to describe him--had wrought  so remarkable a transformation in both Thuvan Dihn and myself that  our own wives would never have known us.  Our skins were of the  same lemon color as his own, and great, black beards and mustaches  had been deftly affixed to our smooth faces.  The trappings of  warriors of Okar aided in the deception; and for wear beyond the  hothouse cities we each had suits of the black- and yellow-striped  orluk.    Talu gave us careful directions for the journey to Kadabra, the  capital city of the Okar nation, which is the racial name of the  yellow men.  This good friend even accompanied us part way, and  then,"]]]
