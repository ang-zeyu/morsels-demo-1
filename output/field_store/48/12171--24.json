If such a thing had taken place Sidney Rigdon and Lyman Wight  would most certainly have remembered it on that day. But they were not  only ignorant of such a thing, but each took a course diametrically  opposed to this alleged blessing. The entire lives of Caleb Baldwin and  Alexander McRae also protest against the statement of Lyman Wight.[4]    The testimony of James Whitehead is as follows:        \"I recollect a meeting that was held in the winter of 1843,      at Nauvoo, Ill., prior to Joseph Smith's death, at which the      appointment was made by him, Joseph Smith, of his successor. His      son Joseph was selected as his successor. Joseph Smith did the      talking. There were present Joseph and Hyrum Smith, John Taylor,      and some others who also spoke on the subject; there were 25 I      suppose at the meeting. At that meeting Joseph Smith, the present      presiding officer of the complainant church, was selected by his      father as his successor. He was ordained and anointed at that      meeting. Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, anointed him, and Joseph, his      father, blessed him and ordained him and Newel K. Whitney poured      the oil on his head, and he was set apart to be his father's      successor in office, holding all the powers that his father held.      I cannot tell all the persons that were present, there was a good      many there. John Taylor and Willard Richards, they were two of the      Twelve, Ebenezer Robinson was present, and George J. Adams, Alpheus      Cutler, and Reynolds Cahoon. I cannot tell them all; I was there      too.\"    Newel K. Whitney, John Taylor, Willard Richards and Reynolds Cahoon all  remained with the Church and came with the Twelve to Utah. Their entire  lives protest against this falsehood of James Whitehead. They deny that  any such ordination ever took place. Ebenezer Robinson also denies it  and after the martyrdom, he followed Sidney Rigdon, and later joined  the Whitmerites. If George J. Adams was present on such an occasion, he  soon forgot it, for after the martyrdom, he followed James J. Strang  and acknowledged him as the legal successor to the Prophet Joseph  Smith, and was the very man who crowned Strang \"king\" on Beaver Island.  Alpheus Cutler also denied that any such thing as this occurred. I  shall read his testimony. This is the statement of Abraham Kimball, his  grandson:    Father Cutler said:        \"I know that Brigham Young is Joseph Smith's legal and lawful      successor, and always did know it. But the reason I am where I      am, I could not be led but must lead. I have run my race and must      meet my fate, and I know what my doom is, as I died once as dead      as any one dies. And I went to the land of spirits, and saw the      crown I should wear if I remained faithful and the condemnation I      should meet if I failed. I begged to stay. I was informed I could      not remain now, but must return and warn sinners to repent. And      the first word I spoke on returning was to Sidney Rigdon, who      was bending over me, 'Sidney, repent of your sins or you will be      damned.' He then continued. 'I know that Mormonism is true. I know      that Heber C. Kimball is your father, and Isaac's and he is a good      man. Now I want you to take Isaac and return to your father, and      remain true to Mormonism and never yield the point, for it will      save and exalt you in the kingdom of God and all who will live      it to the end of their days.' He then wept like a child, which      caused my eyes to moisten. After recovering himself he continued by      saying: 'Now my boy, I want to ask one favor of you, and that is      that you will never reveal what I have told you today to the people      I lead while I live as you boys are going away and I depend on the      people for my support.' I promised him I would do as requested. He      then released me to go visiting.\"        \"Now, Mr. Wilcox (E. S. Wilcox) and friends, I am in a shape that I      may be called to meet my God any minute, as disease is praying upon      my poor body and I am near a skeleton, and my flesh may soon be      devoured by worms; but I bear testimony to you before my God that      the statement I have made of Alpheus Cutler's confession is correct      as near as I can word it.\"--Saints' Herald, Vol. 52:255.    You see that each of these men named by James Whitehead give the lie  to his declaration by their entire lives, but this is not all. Joseph  Smith of the \"Reorganized\" Church denies it himself. While he states  that he was blessed by his father, in his testimony under oath in the  Temple lot suit, he said:        \"No, sir, I did not state that I was ordained by my father; I did      not make the statement. I was NOT ordained by my father as his      successor--according to my understanding of the word ordained, I      was not\"--Plaintiff's Abstract, Page 79, Par. 126.    Thus the testimony of James Whitehead is worthless. John S. Carter said  the Prophet chose his son at a public meeting in Nauvoo on a Sunday,  \"not long before Joseph was killed.\" (True Succession, page 48). Yet  none of the people knew of this. Nothing was said of it during the  trouble with Sidney Rigdon. And William Marks, president of the Nauvoo  Stake, would most likely be present at the public meetings held on  Sundays in Nauvoo. Yet he supported the claim of Sidney Rigdon to be  the guardian when the latter declared that there could be no successor.  It is a little strange that such an appointment could be made at a  public meeting and all the people--just a few months later--be ignorant  of it. Where were the people the day this public meeting was held? How  much easier it would have been for Sidney Rigdon to have said, August  8, 1844: \"I want to be appointed 'Guardian' until young Joseph grows  up,\" instead of declaring that no successor could be appointed! How  easy it would have been for Lyman Wight to have said, \"I was present  when Joseph blessed his son in Liberty prison, as his successor,\" or  for James Whitehead and John S. Carter to have declared that young  Joseph had been ordained as his father's successor in a public meeting  in Nauvoo shortly before the martyrdom, and thus have reminded the  people of it. How strange that such an important occurrence should slip  the minds of the entire people on such a vital occasion? But they did  not think of it. The truth is it was an afterthought on the part of  these men.    Another thing which is peculiar: There were too many \"appointments\"  and \"ordinations\" of this \"successor\" which makes the thing look  suspicious. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the Prophet,  \"appointed,\" \"blessed,\" and \"ordained\" his son to this office every few  days. If such a thing had taken place it would have been done in the  proper way and manner in the presence of the presiding officers of the  Church and a proper record of it would have been made and filed away.  But the records of the Church are silent and it is quite significant  that Lyman Wight, James Whitehead, John S. Carter and even Joseph  of the \"Reorganization\" himself had \"forgotten\" this \"appointing\"  or \"ordination\" at the most critical moment for it to have been  mentioned--August 8, 1844.    William Smith stated that the right of Presidency was by lineage,  and therefore he supported the son of the Prophet in 1850, or even  in November, 1845. (True Succession, p. 17). Yet William Smith knew  of no appointment or ordination of young Joseph, although he was one  of the Apostles, and would have been sure to have known had such a  thing taken place. In May, 1845, he stated that the Twelve were the  proper authorities to lead the Church. (Times and Seasons, 6:904).  He was excommunicated in the following October and it was not till  after his excommunication that he advocated the right of young Joseph.  Furthermore, William Smith claimed that he was himself ordained by his  brother to lead the Church (Roberts' Succession, pp. 103-105.) And he  also followed James J. Strang and accepted him as the \"successor\" until  excommunicated from that cult.    Now, can we put any credence in the testimonies of such men as Lyman  Wight, James Whitehead, John S. Carter, and William Smith? Most  assuredly not.    That the Prophet did not choose his son is quite evident also from the  following testimony given by reliable witnesses and at the proper time:      TESTIMONY OF PRESIDENT YOUNG.    At a meeting held at Nauvoo, August 7, 1844, he said:        \"How often has Joseph said to the Twelve, 'I have laid the      foundation and you must build thereon, for upon your shoulders the      kingdom rests. * * * * I tell you in the name of the Lord, that      no man can put another between the Twelve and the Prophet Joseph      Smith. Why? Because Joseph was their file leader, and he has      committed into their hands the keys of the kingdom in this last      dispensation for all the world; don't put a thread between the      Priesthood of God.\"--(History of the Church for August 7, 1844).    And in a letter written to Orson Spencer, January 23, 1848, President  Young said:        \"Joseph told the Twelve the year before he died, 'There is not one      key or power to be bestowed on this Church to lead the people into      the celestial gate but I have give you, showed you, and talked      it over to you, the kingdom is set up, and you have the perfect      pattern, and you can go and build up the kingdom and go in at the      celestial gate, taking your train with you.\"--Mill. Star, 10:115.      TESTIMONY OF HEBER C. KIMBALL.        \"Brother Joseph has passed behind the veil, and he pulled off his      shoes, and some one else puts them on, until he passes the veil to      Brother Joseph. President Young is our president, and our head, and      he puts the shoes on first.

The anticipated rate  of expenditure is likely to be heaviest during the next 2 years.    (e) Since the Bretton Woods Agreements have now been approved by the  required number of countries, both the International Monetary fund and the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will commence  operations during 1946. The organization of these institutions will  undoubtedly take some time, and it is unlikely that their operations will  reach any appreciable scale before the beginning of the fiscal year 1947.    Of the 2,750 million dollars required for the fund, 1,800 million dollars  will be provided in cash or notes from the exchange stabilization fund  established under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. The remaining 950 million  dollars will be paid initially in the form of non-interest-bearing notes  issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is not anticipated that the  fund will require in cash any of the 950 million dollars during the fiscal  years 1946 and 1947. Consequently, no cash withdrawals from the Treasury  will be required in connection with the fund in these years.    The subscription to the Bank amounts to 3,175 million dollars. Of this  total, 2 percent must be paid immediately and the Bank is required to call  a further 8 percent of the subscription during its first year of  operations. The balance of the subscription is payable when required by the  Bank either for direct lending or to make good its guarantees. It is likely  that the United States will be required to pay little if any more than the  initial 10 percent before the end of the fiscal year 1947.    I anticipate that net expenditures of the Export-Import Bank and  expenditures arising from the British credit and the Bretton Woods  Agreements will amount to 2,614 million dollars, including the noncash item  of 950 million dollars for the fund, in the fiscal year 1946, and 2,754  million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.    GENERAL GOVERNMENT    The responsibilities of the Government, in both domestic and international  affairs, have increased greatly in the past decade. Consequently, the  Government is larger than it was before the war, and its general operating  costs are higher. We cannot shrink the Government to prewar dimensions  unless we slough off these new responsibilities--and we cannot do that  without paying an excessive price in terms of our national welfare. We can,  however, enhance its operating efficiency through improved organization. I  expect to make such improvements under the authority of the Reorganization  Act of 1945.    The appropriations which I am recommending for general government for the  fiscal year 1947 are 1,604 million dollars under existing legislation. This  is an increase of 458 million dollars over the total of enacted  appropriations for the current fiscal year, but a substantial part of this  increase is due to the fact that the appropriations for the fiscal year  1946 were made prior to the general increase of employees' salaries last  July 1, for which allowance is made in the anticipated supplemental  appropriations for 1946. The recommended total for 1947 for general  government, like the estimates for national defense and other specific  programs, does not allow for the further salary increases for Government  employees which, I hope, will be authorized by pending legislation, but-the  tentative lump-sum estimates under proposed legislation contemplate that  such salary increases will be effective almost at once.    Expenditures for general government in the fiscal year 1947 are expected to  continue the slowly rising trend which began in 1943. This category  includes a great variety of items--not merely the overhead costs of the  Government. It includes all the expenditures of the Cabinet departments,  other than for national defense, aids to agriculture, general public works,  and the social security program. It includes also expenditures of the  legislative branch, the Judiciary, and many of the independent agencies of  the executive branch. Consequently, the estimated increase in 1947 in the  total of general government expenditures reflects a variety of influences.    Now included in general government are certain activities formerly  classified under national defense. Some of these, such as certain functions  of the former foreign Economic Administration and the War Manpower  Commission, are still needed during the period of reconversion; others are  in the process of liquidation. A few wartime activities, for example, the  international information and foreign intelligence services and some of the  wartime programs for controlling disease and crime, have become part of our  regular government establishment. Expenditures for these former wartime  functions explain about 40 percent of the increase in expenditures for  general government.    Other increases are for civil aeronautics promotion, the business and  manufacturing censuses, and other expanded business services of the  Department of Commerce which have been referred to above; the forest and  Soil Conservation Services and other committees of the Department of  certain conservation activities of the Department of the Interior; and the  collection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department.    The necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war  and advances in the rates of pay for postal employees have increased  substantially the estimated expenditures for postal service for both the  current and the next fiscal year. It is not expected that this increase  will cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year, although  an excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are  increased further.    Expenditures for our share of the administrative budgets of the United  Nations and other permanent international bodies will increase sharply in  the fiscal year 1947, yet will remain a small part of our total Budget. The  budget for the United Nations has not yet been determined; an estimate for  our contribution will be submitted later. Our contributions to the food and  Agriculture Organization, the International Labor Office, the Pan American  Union, and other similar international agencies will aggregate about 3  million dollars for the fiscal year 1947. The administrative expenses of  the International Monetary fund and the International Bank will be met from  their general funds.    We have won a great war--we, the nations of plain people who hate war. In  the test of that war we found a strength of unity that brought us  through--a strength that crushed the power of those who sought by force to  deny our faith in the dignity of man.    During this trial the voices of disunity among us were silent or were  subdued to an occasional whine that warned us that they were still among  us. Those voices are beginning to cry aloud again. We must learn constantly  to turn deaf ears to them. They are voices which foster fear and suspicion  and intolerance and hate. They seek to destroy our harmony, our  understanding of each other, our American tradition of \"live and let live.\"  They have become busy again, trying to set race against race, creed against  creed, farmer against city dweller, worker against employer, people against  their own governments. They seek only to do us mischief. They must not  prevail.    It should be impossible for any man to contemplate without a sense of  personal humility the tremendous events of the 12 months since the last  annual Message, the great tasks that confront us, the new and huge problems  of the coming months and years. Yet these very things justify the deepest  confidence in the future of this Nation of free men and women.    The plain people of this country found the courage and the strength, the  self-discipline, and the mutual respect to fight and to win, with the help  of our allies, under God. I doubt if the tasks of the future are more  difficult. But if they are, then I say that our strength and our knowledge  and our understanding will be equal to those tasks.    As printed above, references to tables appearing in the budget document  have been omitted.    ***    State of the Union Address  Harry S. Truman  January 6, 1947    Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:    It looks like a good many of you have moved over to the left since I was  here last!    I come before you today to report on the State of the Union and, in the  words of the Constitution, to recommend such measures as I judge necessary  and expedient.    I come also to welcome you as you take up your duties and to discuss with  you the manner in which you and I should fulfill our obligations to the  American people during the next 2 years.    The power to mold the future of this Nation lies in our hands--yours and  mine, and they are joined together by the Constitution.    If in this year, and in the next, we can find the right course to take as  each issue arises, and if, in spite of all difficulties, we have the  courage and the resolution to take that course, then we shall achieve a  state of well-being for our people without precedent in history. And if we  continue to work with the other nations of the world earnestly, patiently,  and wisely, we can--granting a will for peace on the part of our  neighbors-make a lasting peace for the world.    But, if we are to realize these ends, the Congress and the President,  during the next 2 years, must work together. It is not unusual in our  history that the majority of the Congress represents a party in opposition  to the President's party. I am the twentieth President of the United States  who, at some time during his term of office, has found his own party to be  in the minority in one or both Houses of Congress. The first one was George  Washington. Wilson was number eighteen, and Hoover was number nineteen.    I realize that on some matters the Congress and the"]]]
