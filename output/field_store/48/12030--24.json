An  eminent clergyman, now deceased, said in conversation with another,  that he had often conversed with Mr. Calhoun on the subject of  religion, and had no doubt as to his piety. I have remarked his  reverential air in church, and have known him apparently much  disturbed by any inattention in others. He never united with any  church, and it is my opinion, formed not without some reason, that he  was prevented, not by disregard to any Christian ordinances, but from  personal and conscientious scruples with respect to his  qualifications. He was a man who weighed every thing with mathematical  precision.    Although open as day on topics of general interest, he was reserved in  respect to himself. I do not recollect ever to have heard him speak  egotistically, for his mind seemed always engrossed by some great  thought, and he appears, even at the close of life, to lose all  personal solicitudes in his anxiety for his country. In one of his  last letters he says, \"But I must close. This may be my last  communication to you. My end is probably near, perhaps very near.  Before I reach it, I have but one serious wish to gratify--it is to  see my country quieted under some arrangement (alas, I know not what!)  that will be satisfactory to all and safe to the south.\" His country's  peace, and quietness, and safety, he did not see; he perished in the  storm; and there are many who knew and loved him who cherish the hope  that he is removed to a higher sphere of action--that his noble spirit  has meekly entered into the presence of its author, and that in the  starry courts above he will receive an inheritance \"incorruptible,  undefiled, and that fadeth not away.\"    When I saw the elaborate preparations which were made here in  Charleston for his funeral, knowing his simple tastes and habits, and  his benevolence, I was at first pained, and I thought he would not  have sanctioned so much display. I feared too that solemnity would be  lost in pageantry. But it was not so. There was nothing to jar upon  the feelings of the most sensitive. All was in perfect and mournful  harmony. Silently and reverently his sorrowing countrymen bore his  remains from the steamer where they had reposed, under a canopy  wearing its thirty stars, and when the hearse, so funereal with  mournful drapery and sable plumes, entered the grounds of the citadel,  deep silence brooded over the vast multitude; noiselessly were heads  uncovered, banners dropped--not a sound but that of the tramp of  horses was heard; statue-like was that phalanx, with every eye  uplifted, to the sacred sarcophagus. If there was too much of show, it  was redeemed by the spirit that prompted it: the symbols, significant  and expressive, as they were, faintly shadowed forth the deep and  universal grief; the mournful pageantry, the tolling bell, the muffled  drum, the closed and shrouded stores and houses, gave external signs  of wo, but more impressive and affecting was the peaceful sadness  which brooded over the metropolis while it awaited the relics of the  patriot, and the deep silence which pervaded the vast procession that  followed to the City Hall, the subdued bearing of the crowd who  resorted thither, and the solemnity expressed on every face--for these  told that the great heart of the city and commonwealth wept in hushed  and sincere sorrow over \"the mighty fallen in the midst of the  battle.\"    One day and night the illustrious dead reposed in state in the draped  and darkened Hall. An entrance was formed by the arching palmetto,  that classic tree, under whose branches Dudon the crusader was placed,  when slain in Palestine. On that tree--\"altissima palma\"--his comrades  placed his trophies. With a spirit as sad as that of the crusaders  when under the verdant foliage of the palm they mourned the noble  Dudon, did those who loved our champion pass beneath that arch, dark  with funereal gloom. The sarcophagus was within a magnificent  catafalque; the canopy rested on Corinthian columns; the bier was  apparently supported by six urns, while three pearl-colored eagles  surmounted the canopy, holding in their beaks the swinging crape.  Invisible lamps cast moonlight beams over the radiated upper surface  of the canopy. Through the day numbers resorted to this hallowed spot,  and at night vigils were held where the dead reposed. When morning  came the chosen guards carried the remains of the great leader to the  church. The funeral car was not allowed to bear these sacred remains  to the tomb, but they were borne by sons of the state, with uncovered  heads. Well might those who saw all these things feel that Carolina  would never be wanting to herself. The body was placed upon the bier,  surrounded by significant offerings, pure flowers and laurel-wreaths.  A velvet pall, revealing in silver lines the arms of the state, the  palmetto, covered the sarcophagus. Above it was a coronet woven of  laurel-leaves, like that which crowned Tasso. Then, in that church,  where columns, arches, and galleries were shrouded in the drapery of  wo, the funeral rites were performed--the mighty dead was placed in  his narrow tomb.    Peerless statesman, illustrious counsellor, devoted patriot, generous  friend, indulgent husband and father, thy humble, noble heart is still  in death; thy life was yielded up at the post of duty; thou hast  perished like a sentinel on guard, a watchman in his tower. \"Thou wast  slain in thy high places.\" Clouds gathered thick and fast about thy  country's horizon, and even thy eagle eye failed in its mournful gaze  to penetrate the gloom which hides its future from mortal eye. Thy  work is finished--peacefully rest with thine own! Thy memory is  enshrined in the hearts of those for whom thy heart ceased its  beating. Thy grave is with us--        \"Yet spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee,        For like thine own eagle that soared to the sun,      Thou springest from bondage, and leavest behind thee        A name which before thee few mortals have won.\"    In reviewing the character of Mr. Calhoun, we find a rare combination  of mental and moral qualities--a union of contrasts. He had genius  with common sense, the power of generalization with the habit of  abstraction, rapidity of thought with application and industry. His  mind was suggestive and logical, imaginative and practical. His noble  ideal was embodied in his daily life. He was at once discursive and  profound; he could soar like the eagle, or hover on unwearied wings  around a minute circle. He meekly bore his lofty endowments; his  childlike simplicity imparted a charm to his transcendent intellect;  he united dignity with humility, sincerity with courtesy, decision  with gentleness, stern inflexibility with winning urbanity, and keen  sensibility with perfect self-command. He was indulgent to others,  denying to himself; he was energetic in health, and patient in  sickness; he combined strict temperance with social habits; he was  reserved in communicating his personal feelings, but his heart was  open on subjects of general interest; he prized the regard of his  fellow-beings, but was superior to worldly pomps and flatteries; he  honored his peers, but was not swayed by their opinions. Equal to the  greatest, he did not despise the least of men. He did not neglect one  duty to perform another. In the Senate he was altogether a senator, in  private and domestic life he was as though he had never entered the  halls of the nation, and had never borne an illustrious part in the  councils of his country.

MORELL,    Translator of Fourier \"On the Passions,\" &c.      The history of literatures, like that of nations, has presented its  varieties as well as its curiosities, and both alike furnish similar  though not identical features.    1st. Families and clans are traceable equally in each development, and  the movements both of literatures and races have displayed a  corresponding monotony and eccentricity, convergence and divergence,  in proportion as they have progressed along the beaten track of  opinion or performed outpost duty as the corps of guides.    2d. Not only is this family likeness obvious in the general  characteristics of ethnography and authorship, but the laws of lineage  and the hereditary transmission of qualities are as strongly marked in  one case as in the other. Letters as well as races have their  hereditary sceptres and coronets; but whereas, in the latter case the  fleshly heir of the great of other days may chance to be unworthy of  his sires, the spiritual sonship of the patrician writer is  stereotyped upon each line and lineament of his nature.    3d. Nor is the connection between words and peoples confined to a law  of analogy running through them both, but they have reacted upon and  moulded each other in a manner curious to relate, and races and  letters have mutually made and unmade each other.    4th. The Indo-Germanic people have left monuments of their sinewy  energy in the psycho-physical characteristics of affiliated races and  tongues, and individual family likenesses may be readily traced  between groups of thinkers and dreamers on the banks of the Ganges, in  the Academy, and at Weimar. Again the mystical semitic world, groaning  beneath the weight of an overwrought ideal, and lacking the ballast of  science and patient thought, has ever and anon given birth to  prodigies and monsters of cabalistic or Gnostic extravagance.    5th.

Its history, (#18)"],[1,"and hoofs.    Some of the sufferers have an external horripilation, transient  shiverings are felt in the front and hind quarters and at the junction  of the limbs with the trunk. Some pregnant cows near their delivery  miscarry. In a word, at this period of irritation, the whole frame is at  war with the typhic elements which besiege it, and which overcome the  preservative power of the vital forces, and from this general  disturbance arises an incandescent fever, which drains and stops all the  secretions at their source.    These general symptoms are the first signs and warnings of functional  derangements more significant, which may, however, vary according to the  predispositions of each animal, and transfer their evolutions either to  the nervous centres or to the respiratory mucous membrane, or to that of  the digestive channels, in the inflammatory and febrile form of the  contagious typhus. Such at least is what we observe in the typhus of  1865 in England.    The functional derangements, in truth, subordinate to and depending on  the predispositions exhibited by the cattle, are far from being the same  in all. In some, the nervous derangements predominate; in others, it is  those of the respiratory, and in others, it is those of the digestive  channels.    As in this period of irritation the nervous centres are more  particularly affected, the animal suffers cerebral and rickety pains, a  constant cephalalgia, which provokes vague anxiety; he is sometimes  cheerful, sometimes wild and furious; he clenches his teeth and yawns,  the muscles of his face spasmodically contract, the spine feels very  sensitive when pressed, a burning and insatiable thirst comes on, the  breathing is hurried, and the intestinal evacuations are suspended.    In this form the toxaemia appears to concentrate about the nervous  centres--as is observed elsewhere at the outset of certain violent  fevers, in the typhus and typhoid fever of man, for instance--and some  of their number may perish the victims of these nervous disorders, and  even fall as if struck with electricity. They die apparently from the  result of the typhic poison; for at this second period, we do not trace  in the nervous centres those injuries which might account for so sudden  a death.    When the respiratory apparatus concentrates upon it the febrile  congestion, the breathing becomes painful, accelerated, embarrassed,  sometimes convulsive, and a deep, oppressive cough is heard from time to  time. The animal, under the yoke of this oppressive uneasiness, turns  his head from right to left, scents, and seems to question his flanks,  where the seat of the disorder is; and then, whether the pulmonary  affection is congestive or inflammatory or emphysematous, he may die of  the consequences of obstruction to the pulmonary circulation and from  the alteration of the blood, under the influence of a slow asphyxia,  but only at the third or fourth period.    Finally, when the typhus localizes more particularly its morbid  phenomena on the digestive channels, we discern local alterations on the  floor of the tongue and the buccal mucous membrane, spots of livid red,  leaving behind them ulcerations of greater or less extent and depth on  different parts of the intestinal canal. In this form, which follows  more regularly all the periods, constipation is obstinate at the outset,  evacuation of the bowels takes place with difficulty, the faeces are hard  and the urine scanty, the belly is inflated and sensitive.    Sometimes at this period of initiation, one of these three symptomatic  forms--the nervous, the pulmonary, and the digestive--may predominate  exclusively, so far as to mask the disease as a whole, and to constitute  it a special malady. But in that case, it is only the exaggeration of  the functional derangements which in their total constitute the typhus:  for when the distemper pursues its course, these three principal centres  of life are always affected in different degrees. Thus, not one of the  cattle smitten with the typhus goes through all the phases of the  disease, without suffering at a given moment in its nervous,  respiratory, and digestive functions.    In this respect, the typhus of the ox presents an apparent analogy with  the typhoid fever in man, although it is different. Consequently, the  name of _typhus fever_ given by some veterinary surgeons, is not  altogether inapplicable to it.    3. _Period of Duration._--At this stage of the disease, which may be  said to extend from the fourth to the seventh day, the nervous  derangements are confined to symptoms of uneasiness and sensibility  along the dorsal spine; for those cases which exhibited more violent  derangement in the nervous functions have proved fatal. In this period  of the disease the breathing is more embarrassed, particularly when the  pulmonary form of the disease prevails. The pulse, which is hard and  frequent, indicates from forty to sixty pulsations; the beatings of the  heart are more violent and audible; the mucous membranes, dry at the  outbreak, recover their secretions, but these latter are endowed with  irritating properties. Thus the eyelids, swollen and tumefied at the  edges beneath the lashes, drip with a corrosive liquid, which soon marks  its furrow along the chanfrin; the bronchiae, the trachea, the nostrils,  the salivary glands, exude a serosity which runs out of the nasal and  buccal orifices. The exanthematic eruption having discharged itself  through the digestive channels, constipation is followed by diarrhoea,  rumination is completely stopped, the beast declines all solid  nutriment, and pants for drinks,--for those especially which have a  slight taste of acidity in them.    The derangements at this period pursue a rapid course--the breathing  becomes more and more difficult, the skin is hot and dry, the hairs  stiffen more and more, gases are developed in the cellular tissues  beneath the skin, along the dorsal vertebrae, at the abdominal folds of  the posterior limbs and under the abdomen, in the form of flat, uneven,  crepitant tumours, which crackle when pressed with the hand; the  diarrhoea becomes more liquefied and irritant, for then it is no  longer a flow of droppings covered with mucus which is expelled, but  secretions already putrid, sometimes reddish in colour, and attended  with foetid gases, which induce tenesmus in the rectum, and force up  the tail. The animal grows perceptibly lean, his dejection is extreme,  and cows which are with calf miscarry.    At night, the animal seems to have an increase of fever, sometimes of a  remittent type, after which he becomes drowsy and lies down to rest  himself or to sleep, if he can; but the difficulty of breathing, the  abdominal pains, soon force him to rise again, which he cannot do  without an effort.    4. _Period of Decline and Sinking._--This stage is observed to extend  from the eighth day to the twelfth or the fourteenth. The morbid  functions pursue their course, for the disease has its regular phases  and a successive variation of phenomena. The secretions, which a few  days before were fluid and irritating, have undergone a change; they  have become thick and purulent, they flow more slowly from the ocular  mucous membranes, and also from the nasal and buccal, which are red and  inflamed, and they already emit a foetid smell. The dull tarnished  eyes become hollowed, purulent mucus lodges within their orbits, the  bronchiae are stopped up, the breathing grows louder and more panting,  the animal instinctively stretches his neck to ease it; the wasting of  the flesh exposes the bones of the sacrum and coccyx, laying bare the  vertebrae and the ribs; the emphysematous tumours are more extensive and  crackling; the skin, less heated, wrinkles up and splits about the bony  protuberances; the udders are crusty and excoriated; detached boils,  hard and rounded at first, then soft and purulent, begin to show  themselves on the trunk and the upper parts of the limbs. The  diarrhoea, still frequent, becomes bloody and intolerably offensive.    At this final period the organic structure yields to the effects of a  general alteration of the liquids and solids. The vital force has lost  the power of reaction; a mass of blood, decomposed by the double  influence of a virulent toxaemia and the obstructions of respiration,  conveys to all the organs a principle of dissolution; the nervous system  is in a manner paralysed, as is shown in the animal's insensibility.    The secretions stop up the various channels and cavities; they lodge  within them; they undergo a putrid decomposition, and pass out with  difficulty in the form of a purulent and bloody flux, in the highest  degree infectious. Very soon the sick animal has ceased really to live;  it struggles and labours with its agony; if the lungs are clogged with  gas or fluid they rattle hurriedly and often; the animal cannot hold its  head up even when lying down, and when standing moves it to and fro as  if affected with the natural shaking of old age, and as if seeking to  ward off some indescribable evil, the occurrence of which it was  awaiting.    The animal's body is a prey given up beforehand to the laws of organic  decomposition: the internal mucous membrane of the cheeks and lips peels  off in strips when rubbed; the sores on the skin have a livid and  gangrenous look; the eggs which the flies deposit on the edge of the  eyelids and at the nasal orifices, or on the excoriations of the skin,  quickly pass into the state of larvae. The air they expire is cold and  infectious; the native caloric, extinguished in every focus  successively, disappears; the vaginal mucous membrane is tumefied, the  anal opening gapes, and from it flows a bloody and decomposed liquid  which the rectum can no longer expel. The mouth, half open and coated  with a thick glutinous foam, vainly tries to inhale long draughts of air  which can no longer"]]]
