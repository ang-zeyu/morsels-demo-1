The youth called out the second time: \"What do you want  here? Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I'll knock you down the  stairs.\" The sexton thought: \"He can't mean that in earnest,\" so gave  forth no sound, and stood as though he were made of stone. Then the  youth shouted out to him the third time, and as that too had no effect,  he made a dash at the spectre and knocked it down the stairs, so that it  fell about ten steps and remained lying in a corner. Thereupon he tolled  the bell, went home to bed without saying a word, and fell asleep. The  sexton's wife waited a long time for her husband, but he never appeared.  At last she became anxious, and woke the youth, and asked: \"Don't you  know where my husband is? He went up to the tower in front of you.\"  \"No,\" answered the youth; \"but someone stood on the stairs up there just  opposite the trap-door in the belfry, and because he wouldn't answer me,  or go away, I took him for a rogue and knocked him down. You'd better go  and see if it was he; I should be much distressed if it were.\" The wife  ran and found her husband who was lying groaning in a corner, with his  leg broken.    She carried him down, and then hurried with loud protestations to the  youth's father. \"Your son has been the cause of a pretty misfortune,\"  she cried; \"he threw my husband downstairs so that he broke his leg.  Take the good-for-nothing wretch out of our house.\" The father was  horrified, hurried to the youth, and gave him a scolding.    \"What unholy pranks are these? The evil one must have put them into your  head.\" \"Father,\" he replied, \"only listen to me; I am quite guiltless.  He stood there in the night, like one who meant harm. I didn't know who  it was, and warned him three times to speak or begone.\" \"Oh!\" groaned  the father, \"you'll bring me nothing but misfortune; get out of my  sight, I won't have anything more to do with you.\" \"Yes, father,  willingly; only wait till daylight, then I'll set out and learn to  shudder, and in that way I shall be master of an art which will gain me  a living.\" \"Learn what you will,\" said the father, \"it's all one to me.  Here are fifty dollars for you, set forth into the wide world with them;  but see you tell no one where you come from or who your father is, for  I am ashamed of you.\" \"Yes, father, whatever you wish; and if that's all  you ask, I can easily keep it in mind.\"    When day broke the youth put the fifty dollars into his pocket, set out  on the hard high road, and kept muttering to himself: \"If I could only  shudder! if I could only shudder!\" Just at this moment a man came by who  heard the youth speaking to himself, and when they had gone on a bit and  were in sight of the gallows the man said to him: \"Look! there is the  tree where seven people have been hanged, and are now learning to fly;  sit down under it and wait till nightfall, and then you'll pretty soon  learn to shudder.\" \"If that's all I have to do,\" answered the youth,  \"it's easily done; but if I learn to shudder so quickly, then you shall  have my fifty dollars. Just come back to me to-morrow morning early.\"  Then the youth went to the gallows-tree and sat down underneath it, and  waited for the evening; and because he felt cold he lit himself a fire.  But at midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldn't  keep warm. And as the wind blew the corpses one against the other,  tossing them to and fro, he thought to himself: \"If you are perishing  down here by the fire, how those poor things up there must be shaking  and shivering!\" And because he had a tender heart, he put up a ladder,  which he climbed unhooked one body after the other, and took down all  the seven. Then he stirred the fire, blew it up, and placed them all  round in a circle, that they might warm themselves. But they sat there  and did not move, and the fire caught their clothes. Then he spoke:  \"Take care, or I'll hang you up again.\" But the dead men did not hear  and let their rags go on burning. Then he got angry, and said: \"If you  aren't careful yourselves, then I can't help you, and I don't mean to  burn with you\"; and he hung them up again in a row. Then he sat down at  his fire and fell asleep. On the following morning the man came to him,  and, wishing to get his fifty dollars, said: \"Now you know what it is to  shudder.\" \"No,\" he answered, \"how should I? Those fellows up there never  opened their mouths, and were so stupid that they let those few old  tatters they have on their bodies burn.\" Then the man saw he wouldn't  get his fifty dollars that day, and went off, saying: \"Well, I'm blessed  if I ever met such a person in my life before.\"    The youth went too on his way, and began to murmur to himself: \"Oh! if I  could only shudder! if I could only shudder!\" A carrier who was walking  behind him heard these words, and asked him: \"Who are you\" \"I don't  know,\" said the youth. \"Where do you hail from?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Who's  your father?\" \"I mayn't say.\" \"What are you constantly muttering to  yourself?\" \"Oh!\" said the youth, \"I would give worlds to shudder, but no  one can teach me.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" spoke the carrier; \"come along  with me, and I'll soon put that right.\" The youth went with the carrier,  and in the evening they reached an inn, where they were to spend the  night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite  aloud: \"Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!\" The  landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: \"If that's what you're  sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here.\" \"Oh! hold your  tongue!\" said the landlord's wife; \"so many people have paid for their  curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful  eyes were never again to behold daylight.\" But the youth said: \"No  matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that's what I've set  out to do.\" He left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the  neighborhood stood a haunted castle, where one could easily learn to  shudder if one only kept watch in it for three nights. The King had  promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife, and  she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. There was also much  treasure hid in the castle, guarded by evil spirits, which would then  be free, and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich. Many had  already gone in, but so far none had ever come out again. So the youth  went to the King and spoke: \"If I were allowed, I should much like  to watch for three nights in the castle.\" The King looked at him, and  because he pleased him, he said: \"You can ask for three things, none of  them living, and those you may take with you into the castle.\" Then he  answered: \"Well, I shall beg for a fire, a turning lathe, and a carving  bench with the knife attached.\"    On the following day the King had everything put into the castle; and  when night drew on the youth took up his position there, lit a bright  fire in one of the rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife close  to it, and sat himself down on the turning lathe. \"Oh! if I could only  shudder!\" he said: \"but I sha'n't learn it here either.\" Toward midnight  he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard  a shriek from a corner. \"Ou, miou! how cold we are!\" \"You fools!\" he  cried; \"why do you scream? If you are cold, come and sit at the fire and  warm yourselves.\" And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely  forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him  with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed themselves,  they said: \"Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?\" \"Why not?\" he  replied; \"but first let me see your paws.\" Then they stretched out their  claws. \"Ha!\" said he; \"what long nails you've got! Wait a minute: I must  first cut them off.\" Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their  necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws  firmly. \"After watching you narrowly,\" said he, \"I no longer feel any  desire to play cards with you\"; and with these words he struck them dead  and threw them out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of  them to their final rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire,  out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with  fiery chains in such swarms that he couldn't possibly get away from  them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire,  scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on quietly for  a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and  called out: \"Be off, you rabble rout!\" and let fly at them. Some of them  fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the  pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once  more, and warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep  open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked  around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. \"The very thing,\" he  said, and laid himself down in it. But when he wished to close his  eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle.  \"Capital,\" he said, \"only a little quicker.\" Then the bed sped on as if  drawn by six horses, over thresholds and stairs, up this way and down  that. All of a sudden--crash, crash! with a bound it turned over, upside  down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him. But he tossed the  blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: \"Now  anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive,\" lay down at his fire,  and slept till daylight. In the morning the King came, and when he  beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much  for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: \"What a pity! and such a  fine fellow he was.\" The youth heard this, got up, and said: \"It's not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#18)"],[1,"set apart as a day of fasting among the people of  Nauvoo. By thus manifesting a feeling of sympathy and interest, they  sought to cultivate peace and good-will among their fellow-citizens,  and a number of honorable, and some of them influential men, while not  accepting the faith of the Saints, became friendly disposed towards  them, and associated with them in various business transactions.    But the good-will of the Saints was not very generally reciprocated  by the people of Illinois; and there were, even at that early date,  envyings and bitterness manifested by those who were jealous of  the prosperity and increasing power of the Mormons in Nauvoo and  vicinity. The same spirit existed to some extent in Iowa as will be  seen by the following occurrence: General Swazey, in command of the  militia of Iowa, Territory, invited Joseph and Hyrum Smith and General  Bennett to attend the parade of the militia of that Territory at  Montrose. The invitation was accepted, and General Swazey received  his visitors courteously, and so did the militia. But during a recess  in the exercises taken at noon, a Mr. D. W. Kilburn tried to create a  disturbance by circulating the following note among the troops:        Citizens of Iowa--The laws of Iowa do not require you to muster or      be reviewed by Joe Smith or General Bennett; and should they have      the impudence to attempt it, it is hoped that every person having a      proper respect for himself, will at once leave the ranks.    The facts are that these militia companies were not mustered by  Joseph's order, nor did he expect to review them. He had simply  accepted General Swazey's invitation to witness the movements of the  troops as other spectators were doing, and neither Joseph nor Hyrum was  in uniform. General Swazey had been several times invited to attend the  drills and reviews of the Legion at Nauvoo, and he had simply returned  the courtesy to the officers of the Legion. Kilburn's effort, however,  to create a disturbance was not successful, though the papers of the  State commented upon it, and some of them began to whisper that it was  Joseph's ambition to build up a military church and extend his faith,  \"Mohammed-like,\" by the sword.    Early in the summer of 1841, in fact in the month of May, Joseph called  upon the Saints everywhere to come into Hancock County, that there  might be a concentration of effort to build up Nauvoo. The proclamation  closed with these words:        Let it therefore be understood that all the stakes excepting those      in this county (Hancock) and in Lee County, Iowa, are discontinued;      and the Saints instructed to settle in this county as soon as      circumstances will permit.    The Twelve Apostles, whose departure from Nauvoo on their missions  to England under very trying circumstances, was related in a former  chapter, returned during the summer, after accomplishing one of the  most successful and remarkable missions in modern times. They were a  tower of strength to Joseph, and he was not long in availing himself of  their valuable support. At a special conference convened in Nauvoo on  the sixteenth of August, 1841, Joseph said:        The time had come when the Twelve should be called upon to stand      in their place next to the First Presidency; and attend to the      settling of emigrants and the business of The Church at the stakes,      and assist to bear off the kingdom victoriously to the nations. [2]    And he at once turned over to their management many of the temporal  affairs, with which he had been perplexed, and devoted himself more  exclusively to spiritual labors.    One of the most pleasing events that happened, during the summer of  which I write, was the visit of the Indian chief Keokuk to Nauvoo. He  was accompanied by Kiskukosh, Appenoose and about one hundred chiefs  and braves of the Sac and Fox tribes, together with their families.  They were brought over from the Iowa side on the ferry and two large  flat boats. The band and a detachment of the Legion met them at the  landing, but as soon as Keokuk failed to recognize Joseph among those  who had come to bid him welcome, he refused to land or allow any of his  party to go ashore until Joseph made his appearance. The arrangement  had been made for the band and the detachment of the Legion to lead the  dusky visitors to the grove where the Saints held their meetings; and  there Joseph would have joined them. But Keokuk seemed to have his own  ideas in relation to the etiquette to be observed at his reception, and  waited until the Prophet met him at the landing and bade him welcome to  Nauvoo.    At the grove Joseph addressed the Indians at some length, upon what the  Lord had revealed to him concerning their fore-fathers, and recited to  them the glorious promises contained in the Book of Mormon respecting  themselves, the despised remnants of a once splendid race. How their  hearts must have glowed and their eyes brightened as they listened  to the young Prophet relate the story of their forefathers' rise and  fall, and the bright promises held out to them of redemption from their  fallen state! In conclusion Joseph counseled them to cease killing each  other, and warring with other tribes or with the whites. To Joseph's  speech Keokuk replied:        I have a Book of Mormon at my wigwam that you gave me a number of      moons ago. I believe you are a great and good man. Keokuk looks      rough, but I am a son of the Great Spirit. I have heard your      advice. We intend to quit fighting, and follow the good talk you      have given us.    After the \"talk,\" they were feasted by the Saints with good food  and dainties and melons. At the conclusion of the feast, they gave  a specimen of their war dance to entertain the spectators, and then  returned to the Iowa side of the river to their encampment.    Thus passed away the summer of 1841; and by the first of October--the  date fixed for the semi-annual conference--the early autumn frosts had  tinged the forest leaves with purple and gold, giving to the splendid  scenery about Nauvoo an additional charm. President Joseph Smith was  not present at the opening of the conference. He had that morning  gone to assist in laying the corner-stone of the Nauvoo House which  the Saints by revelation had been commanded to build; [3] and the  conference was opened by President Brigham Young.    The principal subject brought before the people at this conference  was the redemption of the dead, and building the temple. This matter  appeared to impress itself upon the mind of Joseph with great force,  and nothing, apparently, gave him more delight than to explain its  importance to his people. Up to this time many baptisms for the dead  had been performed in the river, but it was now announced that no more  baptisms for the dead should be attended to, until it could be done  in the font of the Lord's house, for thus had the Lord commanded. The  Saints, however, were not long denied the privilege of performing this  work of baptism for their dead, as on the eighth of November, following  the conference, a temporary baptismal font had been completed and  dedicated in the basement of the temple. [4]    On the occasion of the angel Moroni's first appearance to Joseph  Smith, in 1823, he repeated to the young Prophet the words of Malachi,  recorded in the fourth chapter of the Book of Malachi, the fifth and  sixth verses, though quoting somewhat differently from the language of  King James' translation, as follows:        Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of      Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day      of the Lord; and he will plant in the hearts of the children the      promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall      turn to their fathers; if it were not so, the whole earth would be      utterly wasted at his coming.    In fulfillment of this promised visitation, in April, 1836, Elijah the  prophet appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and said:        Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken by the mouth of      Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent before the      great and dreadful day of the Lord come, to turn the hearts of the      fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the      whole earth be smitten with a curse. Therefore the keys of this      dispensation are committed into your hands, and by this ye may know      that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the      doors.    And now when something like peace had come to The Church, and settled  conditions obtained, the Prophet of God began to unfold the doctrine  of salvation for the dead--the application of those principles of  salvation to past generations who had lived upon the earth when neither  the Gospel nor divine authority to administer its ordinances were among  men.    In addition to the main idea of this doctrine which he taught with such  great power, the following gems are gathered from his teachings at this  conference, chiefly relating to the same subject:        The proclamation of the first principles of the Gospel, was a means      of salvation to men individually, and it was the truth and not men      that saved them; but men by actively engaging in rites of salvation      substantially became instruments in bringing multitudes of their      kindred into the Kingdom of God. [And hence] he presented baptism      for the dead as the only way by which men can appear as saviors on      Mount Zion.        * * *        The difference between an angel and a ministering spirit: the one      [the first] is a resurrected or translated body with its spirit      ministering to embodied spirits; the other a disembodied spirit      visiting and ministering to disembodied spirits.        * * *        Jesus Christ became a ministering spirit (while his body was laying      in the"]]]
