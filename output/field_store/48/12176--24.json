Are we not all apt to fall into the error of estimating the character of  a country by its extravagances rather than its average and general  qualities?    North Queensland has the reputation of being the home of malaria and the  special sport of any cyclone that may have mischief in view. Being  tropical, we have malaria, but it is of no more serious consequence than  any one of the ills to which human flesh is heir in temperate climes. It  does not exact such a toll of suffering and death as influenza, nor as  typhoid used to do in crowded cities; nor is it as common as rheumatism  in damp and blustering New Zealand, where the thermometer ranges from 100  deg. in the shade to 24 deg. of frost. Malaria touches us lightly, and it  is chosen as a bugbear with which to scare people away. A southern  critic, honestly pitiful of our ill state, urges that the experiment of  destroying those mosquitoes which disseminate the germ of malaria, by  sealing up lagoons and swamps with kerosene, is worthy the attention of  town and country residents in tropical Queensland, \"where attacks of  malaria are felt every summer.\" Mere idle words of pernicious  consequence. Many a wretch who has done less mischief than \"these  utterers of forged tales, coiners of scandal and clippers of reputation,\"  has had his liberty restricted. But a small and an annually lessening  proportion of our population suffers from malaria, and yet all have the  renown of an annual attack! In that case the writer ought to have had  twenty-five attacks, and thousands of others, lusty and toneful fellows,  forty and forty-five attacks. With as much claim upon reason might  one say that because of the sudden jerks of their climate (40 deg.  of difference within twelve hours) all Victorians have to make  three changes of raiment every day in order to avoid ill consequences;  or that every man, woman and child in merry England has had instead  of expects or dreads or hopes to have appendicitis, since King  Edward the Peacemaker suffered, and renown came upon that disorder.  Malaria is fleeing before civilisation. It cannot--at any rate in North  Queensland--long endure the presence of the white man.    Unfeigned pity is bestowed upon the denizens of North Queensland on  account of the pains and penalties and discomforts alleged to be the  sentence of all who dare select it as home. We who know can but smile and  wait; and ever call call to mind pleasant and happy experiences,  everlasting truths and \"the falsehood of extremes.\"    Even in the matter of cyclones--often quoted as one of its  detriments--North Queensland has nothing to hide. At intervals Nature  does indulge in a reckless and violent outburst, but not more frequently  here than in other parts of the world. Year after year the seasons are  passive and pleasant, and in every respect considerate of humanity and  encouraging to humanity's undertakings. Then, abandoning for a few hours  her orderly and kindly ways, Nature runs amok, raving and shrieking. Her  transient irresponsibleness and mischievousness are then cited as  everyday, persistent vices. Not so. Nature is rational even in her most  passionate moments. Vegetation, rank and gross as in an unweeded garden,  requires vigorous lopping and pruning. These twenty-year-interval storms  comb out superfluous leaves and branches, cut out dead wood, send to the  ground decayed and weakly shoots, and scrub and cleanse trunks and  branches of parasitic growths. All is done boldly, yet with such skill  that in a few weeks losses are hidden under masses of clean, insectless,  healthy, bright foliage. The soil has received a luxurious top-dressing.  Trees and plants respond to the stimulus with magical vigour, for lazy,  slumbering forces have been roused into efforts so splendid that the  realism of tropical vegetation is to be appreciated only after Nature has  swept and sweetened her garden.    A more vivid and more idealised medium than the poor one which with  diffidence I employ were essential if entertainment alone were sought in  these pages; but even faint and imperfect etching of one Australian  scene, little known even to Australians, may in some degree tend to  enlightenment.    Many have told of the thin forests of Queensland, the open plains, and  the interminable downs whereon the mirage plays with the fancies of  wayfarers; and of the dust, heat and sweat of cattle stations. Has not  the \"Never Never Country\" inspired many a traveller and more than one  poet? It is well to realise that we have such bountiful land, and to be  proud of the men capable of investing its vastness, monotony and prosaic  wealth with poetic imagery. Is it not also wise to remember now aagain  that Queensland possesses two types of tropical climate, accentuated by  boundaries having far great significance than those which divide tropical  from temperate Australia, and worlds apart in their distinctions? Is not  the land of the banana, the palm and the cedar, entitled to recognition,  as well as the land of the gidyea, the boree, and the bottle-tree? Who  has yet said or sung of the mystery of the half-lit jungles of our coast,  in contrast to the vivid boldness of the sun-sought, shadeless western  plains; of our green, moist mountains, seamed with gloomy ravines, the  sources of perennial streams; of the vast fertile lowlands in which the  republic of vegetation is as an unruly, ungoverned mob, clamouring for  topmost places in unrestrained excess of energy; of still lagoons, where  the sacred pink lotus and the blue and white water-lily are rivals in  grace of form, in tint and in perfume?    If I am successful in convincing that North Queensland is neither a  burning fiery furnace nor yet a sweltering steamy swamp; that the country  is not completely saturated with malaria; that there are vast areas which  no drought can tinge with grey or brown, where there are never-failing  streams, where cool fresh water trickles among the shale and shattered  coral on the beaches, where sweet-voiced birds sport and resplendent  butterflies flicker, then these writings will have been to some purpose.    ISLAND FAUNA    While the bird life of our island is plentiful and varied, mammalian is  insignificant in number. The echidna, two species of rats, a flying fox  (PTEROPUS FUNEREUS) and two bats, comprise the list. Although across a  narrow channel marsupials are plentiful, there is no representative of  that typical Australian order here, and the Dunk Island blacks have no  legends of the existence of either kangaroos, wallabies, kangaroo rats or  bandicoots in times past. But there are circumstantial details extant,  that the island of Timana was an outpost of the wallaby until quite a  recent date. A gin (the last female native of Dunk Island) who died in  1900 was wont to tell of the final battue at Timana, and the feast that  followed, in which she took part as a child. This island, which has an  area of about 20 acres, bears a resemblance to a jockey's cap--the sand  spit towards the setting sun forming the peak, a precipice covered with  scrub and jungle, the back. Here, long ago, a great gathering from the  neighbouring islands and the mainland took place. Early in the morning  all formed up in line on the sand spit. Diverging, but maintaining order,  men, gins, piccaninnies, shouting, yelling, and screaming, and clashing  nulla-nullas (throwing-sticks), supported by barking and yelping dogs  swept the timid wallabies up through the tangle of jungle, until like the  Gaderene swine they ran, or rather hopped, down a steep place into the  sea, or fell on fatal rocks laid bare by the ebb-tide. Those who partook  of the last of the wallabies have gone the way of all flesh, and the  incident is instructive only as an illustration of the manner in which  animals may suddenly disappear from confined localities, leaving no relic  of previous existence. Considering the bulk of Dunk Island (3 1/2 square  miles), and recognising the rule that islands are necessarily poorer in  species than continents, it is yet remarkable that no evidence of  marsupials is to be found, and that the oldest blacks maintain that none  of the type ever existed here.    Though the drawings in caves depict lizards, echidna, turtle and men,  there is no representation of kangaroo or wallaby. It is highly probable  that if such had been common, the black artists would have chosen them as  subjects, since nearly all their studies are from Nature.    The largest and heaviest four-footed creature now existent on Dunk Island  is the so-called porcupine (spiny ant-eater or echidna). An animal which  possesses some of the features of the hedgehog of old England, and  resembles in others that distinctly Australian paradox, the platypus,  which has a mouth which it cannot open--a mere tube through which the  tongue is thrust, which in the production of its young combines the  hatching of an egg as of a bird, with the suckling of a mammal, and which  also has some of the characteristics of a reptile, cannot fail to be an  interesting object to every student of the marvels of Nature. When  disturbed, the echidna resolves itself into a ball, tucking its long  snout between its forelegs, and packing its barely perceptible tail close  between the hind ones, presenting an array of menacing prickles  whencesoever attacked. While in this ball-like posture, the animal, as  chance affords, digs with its short"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1,"purpose, the inflammable gas which exudes plentifully  from the soil is collected by means of pipes, and thence communicated  to a quadruple row of lamps along the whole extent of the passage. Thus  a radiance has been created even out of the fiery and sulphurous curse  that rests forever upon the valley--a radiance hurtful, however, to the  eyes, and somewhat bewildering, as I discovered by the changes which it  wrought in the visages of my companions. In this respect, as compared  with natural daylight, there is the same difference as between truth  and falsehood, but if the reader have ever travelled through the dark  Valley, he will have learned to be thankful for any light that he could  get--if not from the sky above, then from the blasted soil beneath.  Such was the red brilliancy of these lamps that they appeared to build  walls of fire on both sides of the track, between which we held our  course at lightning speed, while a reverberating thunder filled the  Valley with its echoes. Had the engine run off the track,--a  catastrophe, it is whispered, by no means unprecedented,--the  bottomless pit, if there be any such place, would undoubtedly have  received us. Just as some dismal fooleries of this nature had made my  heart quake there came a tremendous shriek, careering along the valley  as if a thousand devils had burst their lungs to utter it, but which  proved to be merely the whistle of the engine on arriving at a  stopping-place.    The spot where we had now paused is the same that our friend Bunyan--a  truthful man, but infected with many fantastic notions--has designated,  in terms plainer than I like to repeat, as the mouth of the infernal  region. This, however, must be a mistake, inasmuch as Mr.  Smooth-it-away, while we remained in the smoky and lurid cavern, took  occasion to prove that Tophet has not even a metaphorical existence.  The place, he assured us, is no other than the crater of a half-extinct  volcano, in which the directors had caused forges to be set up for the  manufacture of railroad iron. Hence, also, is obtained a plentiful  supply of fuel for the use of the engines. Whoever had gazed into the  dismal obscurity of the broad cavern mouth, whence ever and anon darted  huge tongues of dusky flame, and had seen the strange, half-shaped  monsters, and visions of faces horribly grotesque, into which the smoke  seemed to wreathe itself, and had heard the awful murmurs, and shrieks,  and deep, shuddering whispers of the blast, sometimes forming  themselves into words almost articulate, would have seized upon Mr.  Smooth-it-away's comfortable explanation as greedily as we did. The  inhabitants of the cavern, moreover, were unlovely personages, dark,  smoke-begrimed, generally deformed, with misshapen feet, and a glow of  dusky redness in their eyes as if their hearts had caught fire and were  blazing out of the upper windows. It struck me as a peculiarity that  the laborers at the forge and those who brought fuel to the engine,  when they began to draw short breath, positively emitted smoke from  their mouth and nostrils.    Among the idlers about the train, most of whom were puffing cigars  which they had lighted at the flame of the crater, I was perplexed to  notice several who, to my certain knowledge, had heretofore set forth  by railroad for the Celestial City. They looked dark, wild, and smoky,  with a singular resemblance, indeed, to the native inhabitants, like  whom, also, they had a disagreeable propensity to ill-natured gibes and  sneers, the habit of which had wrought a settled contortion of their  visages. Having been on speaking terms with one of these persons,--an  indolent, good-for-nothing fellow, who went by the name of  Take-it-easy,--I called him, and inquired what was his business there.    \"Did you not start,\" said I, \"for the Celestial City?\"    \"That's a fact,\" said Mr. Take-it-easy, carelessly puffing some smoke  into my eyes. \"But I heard such bad accounts that I never took pains to  climb the hill on which the city stands. No business doing, no fun  going on, nothing to drink, and no smoking allowed, and a thrumming of  church music from morning till night. I would not stay in such a place  if they offered me house room and living free.\"    \"But, my good Mr. Take-it-easy,\" cried I, \"why take up your residence  here, of all places in the world?\"    \"Oh,\" said the loafer, with a grin, \"it is very warm hereabouts, and I  meet with plenty of old acquaintances, and altogether the place suits  me. I hope to see you back again some day soon. A pleasant journey to  you.\"    While he was speaking the bell of the engine rang, and we dashed away  after dropping a few passengers, but receiving no new ones. Rattling  onward through the Valley, we were dazzled with the fiercely gleaming  gas lamps, as before. But sometimes, in the dark of intense brightness,  grim faces, that bore the aspect and expression of individual sins, or  evil passions, seemed to thrust themselves through the veil of light,  glaring upon us, and stretching forth a great, dusky hand, as if to  impede our progress. I almost thought that they were my own sins that  appalled me there. These were freaks of imagination--nothing more,  certainly-mere delusions, which I ought to be heartily ashamed of; but  all through the Dark Valley I was tormented, and pestered, and  dolefully bewildered with the same kind of waking dreams. The mephitic  gases of that region intoxicate the brain. As the light of natural day,  however, began to struggle with the glow of the lanterns, these vain  imaginations lost their vividness, and finally vanished from the first  ray of sunshine that greeted our escape from the Valley of the Shadow  of Death. Ere we had gone a mile beyond it I could well-nigh have taken  my oath that this whole gloomy passage was a dream.    At the end of the valley, as John Bunyan mentions, is a cavern, where,  in his days, dwelt two cruel giants, Pope and Pagan, who had strown the  ground about their residence with the bones of slaughtered pilgrims.  These vile old troglodytes are no longer there; but into their deserted  cave another terrible giant has thrust himself, and makes it his  business to seize upon honest travellers and fatten them for his table  with plentiful meals of smoke, mist, moonshine, raw potatoes, and  sawdust. He is a German by birth, and is called Giant  Transcendentalist; but as to his form, his features, his substance, and  his nature generally, it is the chief peculiarity of this huge  miscreant that neither he for himself, nor anybody for him, has ever  been able to describe them. As we rushed by the cavern's mouth we  caught a hasty glimpse of him, looking somewhat like an  ill-proportioned figure, but considerably more like a heap of fog and  duskiness. He shouted after us, but in so strange a phraseology that we  knew not what he meant, nor whether to be encouraged or affrighted.    It was late in the day when the train thundered into the ancient city  of Vanity, where Vanity Fair is still at the height of prosperity, and  exhibits an epitome of whatever is brilliant, gay, and fascinating  beneath the sun. As I purposed to make a considerable stay here, it  gratified me to learn that there is no longer the want of harmony  between the town's-people and pilgrims, which impelled the former to  such lamentably mistaken measures as the persecution of Christian and  the fiery martyrdom of Faithful. On the contrary, as the new railroad  brings with it great trade and a constant influx of strangers, the lord  of Vanity Fair is its chief patron, and the capitalists of the city are  among the largest stockholders. Many passengers stop to take their  pleasure or make their profit in the Fair, instead of going onward to  the Celestial City. Indeed, such are the charms of the place that  people often affirm it to be the true and only heaven; stoutly  contending that there is no other, that those who seek further are mere  dreamers, and that, if the fabled brightness of the Celestial City lay  but a bare mile beyond the gates of Vanity, they would not be fools  enough to go thither. Without subscribing to these perhaps exaggerated  encomiums, I can truly say that my abode in the city was mainly  agreeable, and my intercourse with the inhabitants productive of much  amusement and instruction.    Being naturally of a serious turn, my attention was directed to the  solid advantages derivable from a residence here, rather than to the  effervescent pleasures which are the grand object with too many  visitants. The Christian reader, if he have had no accounts of the city  later than Bunyan's time, will be surprised to hear that almost every  street has its church, and that the reverend clergy are nowhere held in  higher respect than at Vanity Fair. And well do they deserve such  honorable estimation; for the maxims of wisdom and virtue which fall  from their lips come from as deep a spiritual source, and tend to as  lofty a religious aim, as those of the sagest philosophers of old. In  justification of this high praise I need only mention the names of the  Rev. Mr. Shallow-deep, the Rev. Mr. Stumble-at-truth, that fine old  clerical character the Rev. Mr. This-today, who expects shortly to  resign his pulpit to the Rev. Mr. That-tomorrow; together with the Rev.  Mr. Bewilderment, the Rev. Mr. Clog-the-spirit, and, last and greatest,  the Rev. Dr. Wind-of-doctrine. The labors of these eminent divines are  aided by those of innumerable lecturers, who diffuse such a various  profundity, in all subjects of human or celestial science, that any man  may acquire an omnigenous erudition without the trouble of even  learning to read. Thus literature is etherealized by assuming for its  medium the human voice; and knowledge, depositing all its heavier  particles, except, doubtless, its gold becomes exhaled into a sound,  which forthwith steals into the ever-open ear of the community.
