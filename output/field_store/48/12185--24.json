Now for some of our news here. I was desired to go yesterday with  Cannabich to the Intendant, Count Savioli, to receive my present. It was  just what I had anticipated--a handsome gold watch. Ten Carolins would  have pleased me better just now, though the watch and chain, with its  appendages, are valued at twenty Carolins. Money is what is most needed  on a journey; and, by your leave, I have now five watches. Indeed, I  have serious thoughts of having a second watch-pocket made, and, when  I visit a grandee, to wear two watches, (which is indeed the fashion  here,) that no one may ever again think of giving me another. I see from  your letter that you have not yet read Vogler's book. [FOOTNOTE: Ton  Wissenschaft und Ton Kunst.] I have just finished it, having borrowed it  from Cannabich. His history is very short. He came here in a miserable  condition, performed on the piano, and composed a ballet. This excited  the Elector's compassion, who sent him to Italy. When the Elector was in  Bologna, he questioned Father Valoti about Vogler. \"Oh! your Highness,  he is a great man,\" &c., &c. He then asked Father Martini the same  question. \"Your Highness, he has talent; and by degrees, when he is  older and more solid, he will no doubt improve, though he must first  change considerably.\" When Vogler came back he entered the Church, was  immediately appointed Court Chaplain, and composed a Miserere which  all the world declares to be detestable, being full of false harmony.  Hearing; that it was not much commended, he went to the Elector and  complained that the orchestra played badly on purpose to vex and annoy  him; in short, he knew so well how to make his game (entering into so  many petty intrigues with women) that he became Vice-Capellmeister. He  is a fool, who fancies that no one can be better or more perfect than  himself. The whole orchestra, from the first to the last, detest him. He  has been the cause of much annoyance to Holzbauer. His book is more  fit to teach arithmetic than composition. He says that he can make a  composer in three weeks, and a singer in six months; but we have not yet  seen any proof of this. He despises the greatest masters. To myself he  spoke with contempt of Bach [Johann Christian, J. Sebastian's youngest  son, called the London Bach], who wrote two operas here, the first of  which pleased more than the second, Lucio Silla. As I had composed the  same opera in Milan, I was anxious to see it, and hearing from Holzbauer  that Vogler had it, I asked him to lend it to me. \"With all my heart,\"  said he; \"I will send it to you to-morrow without fail, but you won't  find much talent in it.\" Some days after, when he saw me, he said with  a sneer, \"Well, did you discover anything very fine--did you learn  anything from it? One air is rather good. What are the words?\" asked he  of some person standing near. \"What air do you mean?\" \"Why, that odious  air of Bach's, that vile--oh! yes, pupille amate. He must have written  it after a carouse of punch.\" I really thought I must have laid hold  of his pigtail; I affected, however, not to hear him, said nothing, and  went away. He has now served out his time with the Elector.    The sonata for Madlle. Rosa Cannabich is finished. Last Sunday I played  the organ in the chapel for my amusement. I came in while the Kyrie was  going on, played the last part, and when the priest intoned the Gloria I  made a cadence, so different, however, from what is usually heard here,  that every one looked round in surprise, and above all Holzbauer.  He said to me, \"If I had known you were coming, I would have put out  another mass for you.\" \"Oh!\" said I, \"to puzzle me, I suppose?\" Old  Toeschi and Wendling stood all the time close beside me. I gave them  enough to laugh at. Every now and then came a pizzicato, when I rattled  the keys well; I was in my best humor. Instead of the Benedictus here,  there is always a voluntary, so I took the ideas of the Sanctus and  worked them out in a fugue. There they all stood making faces. At the  close, after Ita missa est, I played a fugue. Their pedal is different  from ours, which at first rather puzzled me, but I soon got used to  it. I must now conclude. Pray write to us still at Mannheim. I know all  about Misliweczeck's sonatas [see No. 64], and played them lately at  Munich; they are very easy and agreeable to listen to. My advice is that  my sister, to whom I humbly commend myself, should play them with much  expression, taste, and fire, and learn them by heart. For these are  sonatas which cannot fail to please every one, are not difficult to  commit to memory, and produce a good effect when played with precision.        75.    Mannheim, Nov. 13, 1777.    Potz Himmel! Croatians, demons, witches, hags, and cross batteries! Potz  Element! air, earth, fire, and water! Europe, Asia, Africa, and America!  Jesuits, Augustines, Benedictines, Capucins, Minorites, Franciscans,  Dominicans, Carthusians, and Knights of the Cross! privateers, canons  regular and irregular, sluggards, rascals, scoundrels, imps, and  villains all! donkeys, buffaloes, oxen, fools, blockheads, numskulls,  and foxes! What means this? Four soldiers and three shoulder-belts! Such  a thick packet and no portrait! [FOOTNOTE: The \"Basle\" (his cousin) had  promised him her portrait. She sent it subsequently to Salzburg, where  it still hangs in the Mozarteum.] I was so anxious about it--indeed, I  felt sure of getting it, having yourself written long ago to say that I  should have it soon, very soon. Perhaps you doubt my keeping my promise  [about the ornaments--see No. 71], but I cannot think this either. So  pray let me have the likeness as quickly as you can; and I trust it is  taken as I entreated--in French costume.    How do I like Mannheim? As well as I can any place where my cousin is  not. I hope, on the other hand, that you have at all events received my  two letters--one from Hohenaltheim, and one from Mannheim--this, such as  it is, being the third from here, but making the fourth in all. I must  conclude, for we are just going to dinner, and I am not yet dressed.  Love me as I love you, and then we shall never cease loving each other.  Adieu! J'espere que vous aurez deja pris quelque lection dans la langue  francaise, et je ne doute point que--ecoutez!--que vous aurez bientot le  francais mieux que moi; car il y a certainement deux ans que je n'ai pas  ecrit un mot de cette langue. Encore adieu! Je vous baise les mains.        76.    Mannheim, Nov. 14-16, 1777.    I, Johannes, Chrysostomus, Amadeus, Wolfgangus, Sigismundus, Mozart,  plead guilty to having both yesterday and the day before (and very often  besides) stayed away from home till twelve o'clock at night, from ten  o'clock till the aforesaid hour, I being in the presence and company of  M. Cannabich, his wife and daughter, the Herrn Schatzmeister, Ramm, and  Lang, making doggerel rhymes with the utmost facility, in thought and  word, but not in deed. I should not, however, have conducted myself  in so reckless a manner if our ringleader, namely, the so-called Lisel  (Elisabeth Cannabich), had not inveigled and instigated me to mischief,  and I am bound to admit that I took great pleasure in it myself. I  confess all these my sins and shortcomings from the depths of my heart;  and in the hope of often having similar ones to confess, I firmly  resolve to amend my present sinful life. I therefore beg for a  dispensation if it can be granted; but, if not, it is a matter of  indifference to me, for the game will go on all the same. Lusus enim  suum habet ambitum, says the pious singer Meissner, (chap. 9, p. 24,)  and also the pious Ascenditor, patron of singed coffee, musty lemonade,  milk of almonds with no almonds in it, and, above all, strawberry ice  full of lumps of ice, being himself a great connoisseur and artist in  these delicacies.    The sonata I composed for Madlle. Cannabich I intend to write out as  soon as possible on small paper, and to send it to my sister. I began  to teach it to Madlle. Rose three days ago, and she has learned the  allegro. The andante will give us most trouble, for it is full of  expression, and must be played with accuracy and taste, and the fortes  and pianos given just as they are marked. She is very clever, and learns  with facility. Her right hand is very good, but the left is unhappily  quite ruined. I must say that I do really feel very sorry for her, when  I see her laboring away till she is actually panting for breath; and  this not from natural awkwardness on her part, but because, being so  accustomed to this method, she cannot play in any other way, never  having been shown the right one. I said, both to her mother and herself,  that if I were her regular master I would lock up all her music, cover  the keys of the piano with a handkerchief, and make her exercise her  right and left hand, at first quite slowly in nothing but passages and  shakes, &c., until her hands were thoroughly trained; and after that  I should feel confident of making her a genuine pianiste. They both  acknowledged that I was right. It is a sad pity; for she has so much  genius, reads very tolerably, has great natural aptitude, and plays with  great feeling.    Now about the opera briefly. Holzbauer's music [for the first great  German operetta, \"Gunther von Schwarzburg\"] is very beautiful, but the  poetry is not worthy of such music. What surprises me most is, that so  old a man as Holzbauer should still have so much spirit, for the  opera is incredibly full of fire. The prima donna was Madame Elisabeth  Wendling, not the wife of the flute-player, but of the violinist. She  is in very delicate health; and, besides, this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#18)"],[1,"of all her perplexity at that moment, Mary Bewery was  certain of one fact about which she had no perplexity nor any doubt--it  would not be long before the rumours of which Bryce and Mr. Folliot had  spoken. Although she had only lived in Wrychester a comparatively short  time she had seen and learned enough of it to know that the place was a  hotbed of gossip. Once gossip was started there, it spread, widening in  circle after circle. And though Bryce was probably right when he said  that the person chiefly concerned was usually the last person to hear  what was being whispered, she knew well enough that sooner or later this  talk about Ransford would come to Ransford's own ears. But she had no  idea that it was to come so soon, nor from her own brother.    Lunch in the Ransford menage was an informal meal. At a quarter past one  every day, it was on the table--a cold lunch to which the three members  of the household helped themselves as they liked, independent of the  services of servants. Sometimes all three were there at the same moment;  sometimes Ransford was half an hour late; the one member who was always  there to the moment was Dick Bewery, who fortified himself sedulously  after his morning's school labours. On this particular day all three met  in the dining-room at once, and sat down together. And before Dick had  eaten many mouthfuls of a cold pie to which he had just liberally helped  himself he bent confidentially across the table towards his guardian.    \"There's something I think you ought to be told about, sir,\" he remarked  with a side-glance at Mary. \"Something I heard this morning at school.  You know, we've a lot of fellows--town boys--who talk.\"    \"I daresay,\" responded Ransford dryly. \"Following the example of their  mothers, no doubt. Well--what is it?\"    He, too, glanced at Mary--and the girl had her work set to look  unconscious.    \"It's this,\" replied Dick, lowering his voice in spite of the fact  that all three were alone. \"They're saying in the town that you know  something which you won't tell about that affair last week. It's being  talked of.\"    Ransford laughed--a little cynically.    \"Are you quite sure, my boy, that they aren't saying that I daren't  tell?\" he asked. \"Daren't is a much more likely word than won't, I  think.\"    \"Well--about that, sir,\" acknowledged Dick. \"Comes to that, anyhow.\"    \"And what are their grounds?\" inquired Ransford. \"You've heard them,  I'll be bound!\"    \"They say that man--Braden--had been here--here, to the house!--that  morning, not long before he was found dead,\" answered Dick. \"Of course,  I said that was all bosh!--I said that if he'd been here and seen you,  I'd have heard of it, dead certain.\"    \"That's not quite so dead certain, Dick, as that I have no knowledge of  his ever having been here,\" said Ransford. \"But who says he came here?\"    \"Mrs. Deramore,\" replied Dick promptly. \"She says she saw him go  away from the house and across the Close, a little before ten. So Jim  Deramore says, anyway--and he says his mother's eyes are as good as  another's.\"    \"Doubtless!\" assented Ransford. He looked at Mary again, and saw that  she was keeping hers fixed on her plate. \"Well,\" he continued, \"if it  will give you any satisfaction, Dick, you can tell the gossips that Dr.  Ransford never saw any man, Braden or anybody else, at his house that  morning, and that he never exchanged a word with Braden. So much for  that! But,\" he added, \"you needn't expect them to believe you. I know  these people--if they've got an idea into their heads they'll ride it to  death. Nevertheless, what I say is a fact.\"    Dick presently went off--and once more Ransford looked at Mary. And this  time, Mary had to meet her guardian's inquiring glance.    \"Have you heard anything of this?\" he asked.    \"That there was a rumour--yes,\" she replied without hesitation.  \"But--not until just now--this morning.\"    \"Who told you of it?\" inquired Ransford.    Mary hesitated. Then she remembered that Mr. Folliot, at any rate, had  not bound her to secrecy.    \"Mr. Folliot,\" she replied. \"He called me into his garden, to give me  those roses, and he mentioned that Mrs. Deramore had said these things  to Mrs. Folliot, and as he seemed to think it highly probable that Mrs.  Folliot would repeat them, he told me because he didn't want you to  think that the rumour had originally arisen at his house.\"    \"Very good of him, I'm sure,\" remarked Ransford dryly. \"They all like to  shift the blame from one to another! But,\" he added, looking searchingly  at her, \"you don't know anything about--Braden's having come here?\"    He saw at once that she did, and Mary saw a slight shade of anxiety come  over his face.    \"Yes, I do!\" she replied. \"That morning. But--it was told to me, only  today, in strict confidence.\"    \"In strict confidence!\" he repeated. \"May I know--by whom?\"    \"Dr. Bryce,\" she answered. \"I met him this morning. And I think you  ought to know. Only--it was in confidence.\" She paused for a moment,  looking at him, and her face grew troubled. \"I hate to suggest it,\"  she continued, \"but--will you come with me to see him, and I'll  ask him--things being as they are--to tell you what he told me. I  can't--without his permission.\"    Ransford shook his head and frowned.    \"I dislike it!\" he said. \"It's--it's putting ourselves in his power,  as it were. But--I'm not going to be left in the dark. Put on your hat,  then.\"    Bryce, ever since his coming to Wrychester, had occupied rooms in an  old house in Friary Lane, at the back of the Close. He was comfortably  lodged. Downstairs he had a double sitting-room, extending from the  front to the back of the house; his front window looked out on one  garden, his back window on another. He had just finished lunch in the  front part of his room, and was looking out of his window, wondering  what to do with himself that afternoon, when he saw Ransford and Mary  Bewery approaching. He guessed the reason of their visit at once,  and went straight to the front door to meet them, and without a word  motioned them to follow him into his own quarters. It was characteristic  of him that he took the first word--before either of his visitors could  speak.    \"I know why you've come,\" he said, as he closed the door and glanced at  Mary. \"You either want my permission that you should tell Dr. Ransford  what I told you this morning, or, you want me to tell him myself. Am I  right?\"    \"I should be glad if you would tell him,\" replied Mary. \"The rumour you  spoke of has reached him--he ought to know what you can tell. I have  respected your confidence, so far.\"    The two men looked at each other. And this time it was Ransford who  spoke first.    \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that there is no great reason for privacy.  If rumours are flying about in Wrychester, there is an end of privacy.  Dick tells me they are saying at the school that it is known that  Braden called on me at my house shortly before he was found dead. I know  nothing whatever of any such call! But--I left you in my surgery that  morning. Do you know if he came there?\"    \"Yes!\" answered Bryce. \"He did come. Soon after you'd gone out.\"    \"Why did you keep that secret?\" demanded Ransford. \"You could have told  it to the police--or to the Coroner--or to me. Why didn't you?\"    Before Bryce could answer, all three heard a sharp click of the front  garden gate, and looking round, saw Mitchington coming up the walk.    \"Here's one of the police, now,\" said Bryce calmly. \"Probably come to  extract information. I would much rather he didn't see you here--but I'd  also like you to hear what I shall say to him. Step inside there,\" he  continued, drawing aside the curtains which shut off the back room.  \"Don't stick at trifles!--you don't know what may be afoot.\"    He almost forced them away, drew the curtains again, and hurrying to the  front door, returned almost immediately with Mitchington.    \"Hope I'm not disturbing you, doctor,\" said the inspector, as Bryce  brought him in and again closed the door. \"Not? All right, then--I came  round to ask you a question. There's a queer rumour getting out in the  town, about that affair last week. Seems to have sprung from some of  those old dowagers in the Close.\"    \"Of course!\" said Bryce. He was mixing a whisky-and-soda for his caller,  and his laugh mingled with the splash of the siphon. \"Of course! I've  heard it.\"    \"You've heard?\" remarked Mitchington. \"Um! Good health, sir!--heard, of  course, that--\"    \"That Braden called on Dr. Ransford not long before the accident, or  murder, or whatever it was, happened,\" said Bryce. \"That's it--eh?\"    \"Something of that sort,\" agreed Mitchington. \"It's being said, anyway,  that Braden was at Ransford's house, and presumably saw him, and that  Ransford, accordingly, knows something about him which he hasn't told.  Now--what do you know? Do you know if Ransford and Braden did meet that  morning?\"    \"Not at Ransford's house, anyway,\" answered Bryce promptly. \"I can prove  that. But since this rumour has got out, I'll tell you what I do know,  and what the truth is. Braden did come to Ransford's--not to the house,  but to the surgery. He didn't see Ransford--Ransford had gone out,  across the Close. Braden saw--me!\"    \"Bless me!--I didn't know that,\" remarked Mitchington. \"You never  mentioned it.\"    \"You'll not wonder that I didn't,\" said Bryce, laughing lightly, \"when I  tell you what the man wanted.\"    \"What did he want, then?\" asked Mitchington.    \"Merely to be told where the Cathedral Library was,\" answered Bryce.    Ransford, watching Mary Bewery, saw her cheeks flush, and knew that  Bryce was cheerfully telling lies. But Mitchington evidently had no  suspicion.    \"That all?\" he asked. \"Just a question?\"    \"Just a question--that question,\" replied Bryce. \"I pointed out the  Library--and he walked away. I never saw him again until I was fetched  to him--dead. And I"]]]
