Such bonds are issued for a specified number of years and have  coupons attached, which are cut off when interest is due, and  presented to the treasurer of the company for payment.    These bonds are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on all the  property of the corporation they represent.    To redeem these bonds, when due, the company annually sets apart a  sum, known as a \"Sinking fund,\" for their redemption.    Such bonds are far safer than any form of the company's stock, for  they bear interest that must be met, whether or not dividends are  declared.    As with a real estate mortgage, the property pledged in the bond  should be defined.    RAILROAD BONDS    Every railroad in the country has been built and equipped by the  sale of its bonds. In such cases amounts of stock of the same, or  approximately the face value of the bond, have been given to the  purchaser as a bonus or inducement. Of course, the controlling  stock is always retained by the promoters; and it is through the  representation of this stock that all the business of the  corporation is carried on.    The cases are few where any money was paid directly for the  original issue of any railroad stock.    Bonds sold to build a road are usually known as \"construction\"  bonds. There may be another bond issue for equipment--with a stock  bonus--and still other bonds, each series stating the property  pledged and the purpose for which the money from sales is to be  used.    The _Christian Herald_, in one of its recent financial articles,  clearly defines this species of bonds, as follows:    \"Railroad bonds are usually pledged by the President and Treasurer  of the railroad and by the Trustees, to whom the bonds are made  out, and who must defend the rights of bondholders, should the  company fail to meet any of the obligations it undertook in the  mortgage deed.    \"In other words, a bond is the Corporation's promissory note for  the money originally paid by the investor, with interest for the  same, to be paid to the investor in stated amounts at stated  intervals; and to guarantee its good faith in the matter, the  Company pledges the bondholder an interest in certain property in  its possession. It follows that a bond has a first call upon the  property rights of the corporation; that it represents something  tangible; that it pays a definite amount of interest, and that it  may be reduced at its full value at a certain time.\"    BUYING BONDS    Bonds, like wheat, have their selling prices quoted from day to  day, and they are equally a thing of purchase and sale.    There are banks and brokerage firms that make a specialty of  bonds, and most of these houses are entirely reliable; still, the  novice in such things would do well to investigate for himself  before investing in any bond recommended by any seller.    It is the purpose of the seller to sell; it should be equally the  purpose of the buyer not to be \"sold.\"    Our government, state and municipal bonds speak for themselves,  and in the main require no examination as to the security, though  there have been cities and even states that have defaulted in  their payments.    Bond houses and banks of established reputation cannot afford to  deceive; they receive their compensation in the way of commissions  on sales, and their characterization of the bonds may be accepted  without question, for they invariably investigate the bonds,  before they lend their names to them by offering them for sale.    If there is any doubt in the mind of the would be purchaser as to  the character of the seller, that should be the first thing  investigated.    What the buyer must satisfy himself of is:    1. Who is the seller?  2. What do the bonds represent?  3. Are they negotiable? and  4. Can they be sold again for about their face value?    Every one who has saved money, it is to be supposed, has a bank  account and is acquainted with the president of his local bank.  When in doubt, the advice of such a man may be of great help.          CHAPTER XXIV    THINGS TO REMEMBER        If a man is making a living he should not change his business  after he has passed middle life, unless, indeed, he has a  guarantee that the new venture will be greatly to his advantage.    The best business for the average man is that which affords him  the most pleasure in carrying it on, or at least with which he is  most familiar.    Happiness in one's work means far more than the accumulation of a  fortune in discomfort.    DON'T DECEIVE YOURSELF    Having made your credit and business standing good, keep them good  by an adherence to the same course.    If you can avoid it, do not loan your name to every needy friend  that comes along. Your neighbors question your good judgment every  time you have to meet a note which you were coaxed into endorsing.  You would have saved yourself by loaning the money outright.    Do not deceive yourself into the belief that you are making money  when, as a matter of fact, you may be losing.    You buy an article for two dollars and sell it for two and a half,  and you say to yourself: \"There is fifty cents made.\" But is it?  Let us see.    Before crediting your business with that fifty cents, you should  have considered these points.    1. The loss of interest on that two dollars.  2. Your own time or other time paid for.  3. The capital invested in things not sold.  4. The rent.  5. The transportation, insurance, heat, light, bad accounts,  unsalable goods, taxes, public donations, and the flood of items  that go to swell the outlay of every merchant, whether in the  great city or at the country crossroads.    WEEDING OUT    Every man in trade should make an inventory of his stock at least  once a year. Having done this, he should give his stock a fresh  appearance, whether new goods be added or not, by relegating to  the scrap heap, cellar or the garret all the dingy, dirty,  disreputable stuff that he could not sell or give away, and which  has induced sore eyes whenever seen.    Keep a stock book.    Quite as important as keeping the stock in order is keeping the  books in good shape.    At least once a year the books should be weeded out. Why carry as  bills collectable accounts which you have been assured, for years,  would never be paid?    Wipe them out and charge them to profit and loss.    Where machinery is used, it is a good plan to charge off every  year ten per cent of the cost; this to make good the loss from  wear and tear.    It is only by annual house cleanings and account clearings that  you can tell about how you stand.    LET YOUR WIFE KNOW    It is usually wise for a woman, married or single, to keep her  real estate and her money, if she have any, in her own name. So  also with property bought with her money.    In these cases the woman should deal with her husband, or the  members of her family, the same as she would with strangers with  whom she is transacting business.    Some may say that this suggests a want of confidence and a lack of  that affection that should exist between husband and wife or near  kinsfolk. Such an objection is sheer sentimentality. Be as open  handed and generous as you will with your loved ones, but when it  comes to business, let the work be done in a strictly business way  or not at all.    Many a good business has gone to ruin after the death of the owner  and manager because he had kept his wife in blank ignorance of his  affairs and the way in which he conducted them.    Many a business, that just dragged along till the death of the  manager, has sprung into new life when the widow took charge. This  must in part be credited to natural ability and inborn pluck and  energy, but even these gifts could not have availed if the woman  had been left in ignorance of business methods.    Women, like men, are awkward in new positions, not so much from a  want of ability as a lack of experience.    Put the average man suddenly in charge of a house, and he will  soon demonstrate his helplessness. The woman's deftness comes from  her experience.    As far as it is possible, every husband should post his wife as to  his methods of doing business.    He should not keep her ignorant of his financial affairs.    If he conceal from her the amount of his secure holdings, it may  be that he hopes to surprise her at his death, or long before that  event. But if he have any regard for his family, he should not  hide from her the obligations which may spell ruin if the wife is  not prepared in advance to meet them.    Whether the husband lives or dies, the wife must still care for  the children and attend to her never-lessening household duties.  Think of her as taking on the added burdens of a business of which  she is ignorant.    There are many prosperous husbands to whom what has just been said  will not apply, but if you should ask them the secret of their  success they will not hesitate to tell you that when they married  they took their wives into full partnership, business secrets and  all.    CHILDREN AND BUSINESS    When you send your children to school it is that the training  there received may qualify them to fight the better the ceaseless  life battle.    Of course, we should not regard all education from a business  viewpoint. Money apart, learning is its own greatest reward.    It widens the horizon at every step, and lifts the soul into  strength and a profounder worship. But it will not do to overlook  the business side of the training which the child should receive  in school and out of it.    It is all very well to teach children the sources of the family  revenue and the way to secure it. It is right that they should be  impressed with the dignity of labor and trained in the ways of  earning money, but it is far more important that they should be  taught how to spend money, so as to get the most good from it,  once it is earned.

They learned that Chilon was a very quiet man, that he never spoke  about himself, and that he spent all his time in trying to make his  country great and strong and happy.    Chilon was so busy that the messengers had to wait several days before  they could see him. At last they were allowed to go before him and  state their business.    \"We have here a very beautiful tripod,\" they said. \"The oracle at  Delphi has ordered that it shall be given to the wisest of wise men,  and for that reason we have brought it to you.\"    \"You have made a mistake,\" said Chilon. \"Over in Athens [Footnote:  Ath'ens.] there is a very wise man whose name is Solon. [Footnote:  So'lon.] He is a poet, a soldier, and a lawmaker. He is my worst enemy,  and yet I admire him as the wisest man in the world. It is to him that  you should have taken the tripod.\"        VII      The messengers made due haste to carry the golden prize to Athens.  They had no trouble in finding Solon. He was the chief ruler of that  great city.    All the people whom they saw spoke in praise of his wisdom.    When they told him their errand he was silent for a little while; then  he said:--    \"I have never thought of myself as a wise man, and therefore the prize  is not for me. But I know of at least six men who are famous for their  wisdom, and one of them must be the wisest of the wise.\"    \"Who are they?\" asked the messengers.    \"Their names are Thales, Bias, Pittacus, Cleobulus, Periander, and  Chilon,\" answered Solon.    \"We have offered the prize to each one of them,\" said the messengers,  \"and each one has refused it.\"    \"Then there is only one other thing to be done,\" said Solon. \"Carry  it to Delphi and leave it there in the Temple of Apollo; for Apollo  is the fountain of wisdom, the wisest of the wise.\"    And this the messengers did.    The famous men of whom I have told you in this story are commonly  called the Seven Wise Men of Greece. They lived more than two thousand  years ago, and each one helped to make his country famous.
