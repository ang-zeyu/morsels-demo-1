Because weights of individual mice differ,  water and food consumption was calculated on the basis of the amount  consumed per gram of body weight per day. All foods were air-dry and  contained a negligible amount of water.    First, food and water consumption was measured for nine individuals of  each species on a diet of Purina Laboratory Chow. This chow contains not  less than 23 per cent protein and 4.5 per cent fat, and about 57 per  cent carbohydrate. Since the mice had been maintained on this diet for  several months prior to the experiments, food and water consumption was  measured for a period of only two weeks. Individuals of _P. truei_  consumed more total water and more water per gram of body weight than  individuals of _P. maniculatus_ (Table 7).    Next, 10 mice of each species were placed on a diet of Purina Hog Chow  for a period of four weeks. This chow contains not less than 36 per cent  protein and one per cent fat, and about 42 per cent carbohydrate. Both  species increased their daily water consumption immediately after being  placed on this diet (tables 7 and 11). On the high protein diet, _P.  truei_ again consumed much more water than did _P. maniculatus_ (tables  7 and 9).

Both species consumed similar amounts of food per gram of  body weight, on each of the diets (Table 7). The larger _P. truei_  requires more grams of food per day than the smaller _P. maniculatus_,  but this slight difference in food consumption probably has no effect on  the distribution of these species within Mesa Verde.    The results obtained with the low protein diet were strikingly different  from those of the first two experiments. In this experiment the same  groups of mice were placed on a diet of whole, shelled corn for a period  of six weeks. The corn contained less than 11 per cent protein, about  three per cent fat, and about 80 per cent carbohydrate.    By the end of the first week, on the low protein diet, all mice had  reduced their water intake by about half the amount used per day on the  high protein diet (Table 7). There was not a statistically significant  difference, for either species, between the average amounts of water  drunk in the first and in the sixth weeks of the experiment.    The data in Table 7 show that on all three diets, individuals of _P.  maniculatus_ drank less water per gram of body weight than individuals  of _P. truei_. Variation in water consumption was high; some individuals  of _P. maniculatus_ that drank more than the average amount for the  species, consumed as much water as some individuals of _P. truei_ that  drank less than the average amount. In general, individuals of _P.  maniculatus_ drank about half as much water each day as individuals of  _P. truei_. Individuals of both species were consistent in their  day-to-day consumption.

It is difficult to compare my results with most of the data in  the literature, because of a lack of information as to protein, fat,  carbohydrate, and mineral contents of foods used in other studies.  Lindeborg (1952) and Dice (1922) fed mice on a mixture of rolled oats,  meat scraps, dry skimmed milk, wheat germ, etc. described by Dice  (1934). Their data on water consumption in _P. maniculatus_ indicate  that this mixture probably is lower in protein content than Purina  Laboratory Chow, that was used in my experiments and those of Williams'  (tables 8 and 9).    The amount of dietary protein consumed under natural conditions is not  known for most wild animals. One index of the minimum amount of protein  necessary is the amount required for an animal to maintain its weight.  At best, this can be only an approximation of the required amount, for  other factors, such as stress, disease, change in tissues during oestrus  or gonadal descent, and changes in constituents of the diet other than  protein, would all be expected to affect the body weight (Chew,  1965:145-147).    The data in Table 7 show that both species vary their food intake with  changes in diet. Table 10 shows weight changes that took place in  individual mice when fed each of the three diets. A change in weight of  one gram cannot be considered as important, for the weight of an  individual mouse fluctuates depending upon when he last drank, ate,  defecated or urinated.    The only significant changes in weight occurred when mice were fed low  protein food (Table 10). Individuals of _P. truei_ lost 15.72 per cent  and individuals of _P. maniculatus_ lost 10.03 per cent of their total  body weights on this diet. This indicates that food having a protein  content of more than 10 per cent but less than 23 per cent is required  for maintenance of weight in these animals.    Although knowledge of the amount of water consumed, _ad libitum_, by  adult mice is valuable information, maintenance of the population  depends upon reproduction and dispersal of young individuals. My  trapping data indicate that only two to three per cent of the adults  live long enough to breed in consecutive breeding seasons. In spring,  the breeding population is composed largely of mice that were juveniles  or subadults during the latter parts of the breeding season. Therefore,  the critical time for the population may well be the time when the  season's young are being produced.

As it was, the squall hove her so much over on her  broadside, that the boat which was hanging at the starboard quarter was  washed away. I then stood over to the north shore, to look for anchorage  under the lee of a cape, about three leagues to the north-west of Cape  Tamar. On closing it, the weather became so thick that at times we could  scarcely see two ships' lengths a-head.    \"These circumstances were not in favour of exploring unknown bays, and to  think of passing such a night as was in prospect, under sail in the  Straits, would have been a desperate risk; I was obliged therefore to yield  the hard-gained advantage of this day's beat, and run for the anchorage  whence we had started in the morning.    \"It was nearly dark ere we reached it; and in entering, desirous to keep  well up to windward, in order to gain the best anchorage, I went too close  to the outer islet, and the ship struck violently on a rocky ledge.  However, she did not hang a moment, and was soon anchored in safety.\"    Finding so much danger and difficulty, in proceeding with the ship, without  first knowing where to run for anchorages, Captain Stokes left her in Tamar  Bay, under the charge of Lieutenant Skyring; and, accompanied by Mr. Flinn,  set out in the cutter, with a week's provisions, to examine the south  coast.    In a very arduous and dangerous cruize he discovered several well-sheltered  anchorages, but experienced a \"constant heavy gale from W.N.W., with thick  weather and incessant drenching rain.\" {74}    Captain Stokes says, \"Our discomfort in an open boat was very great, since  we were all constantly wet to the skin. In trying to double the various  headlands, we were repeatedly obliged (after hours of ineffectual struggle  against sea and wind) to desist from useless labour, and take refuge in the  nearest cove which lay to leeward.\"    From the Harbour of Mercy, Captain Stokes attempted to cross the Strait, on  his return to the Beagle; but the sea ran too high, and obliged him to  defer his daring purpose until the weather was more favourable.    During his absence, Lieutenant Skyring surveyed Tamar Bay and its vicinity.    Again the Beagle weighed, and tried hard to make some progress to the  westward, but was obliged a third time to return to Tamar Bay. After  another delay she just reached Sholl Bay, under Cape Phillip, and remained  there one day, to make a plan of the anchorage, and take observations to  fix its position.    The Beagle reached the Harbour of Mercy (Separation Harbour of Wallis and  Carteret),[62] after a thirty days' passage from Port Famine, on the 15th,  having visited several anchorages on the south shore in her way. But  tedious and harassing as her progress had been, the accounts of Byron,  Wallis, Carteret, and Bougainville show that they found more difficulty,  and took more time, in their passages from Port Famine to the western  entrance of the Strait. Byron, in 1764, was forty-two days; Wallis, in  1766, eighty-two; Carteret, in the same year, eighty-four; and  Bougainville, in 1768, forty days, in going that short distance.    Five days were passed at this place, during which they communicated with a  few natives, of whom Captain Stokes remarks; \"As might be expected from the  unkindly climate in which they dwell, the personal appearance of these  Indians does not {75} exhibit, either in male or female, any indications of  activity or strength. Their average height is five feet five inches; their  habit of body is spare; the limbs are badly turned, and deficient in  muscle; the hair of their head is black, straight, and coarse; their  beards, whiskers, and eyebrows, naturally exceedingly scanty, are carefully  plucked out; their forehead is low; the nose rather prominent, with dilated  nostrils; their eyes are dark, and of a moderate size; the mouth is large,  and the under-lip thick; their teeth are small and regular, but of bad  colour. They are of a dirty copper colour; their countenance is dull, and  devoid of expression. For protection against the rigours of these inclement  regions, their clothing is miserably suited; being only the skin of a seal,  or sea-otter, thrown over the shoulders, with the hairy side outward.    \"The two upper corners of this skin are tied together across the breast  with a strip of sinew or skin, and a similar thong secures it round the  waist; the skirts are brought forward so as to be a partial covering. Their  comb is a portion of the jaw of a porpoise, and they anoint their hair with  seal or whale blubber; for removing the beard and eyebrows they employ a  very primitive kind of tweezers, namely, two muscle shells. They daub their  bodies with a red earth, like the ruddle used in England for marking sheep.  The women, and children, wear necklaces, formed of small shells, neatly  attached by a plaiting of the fine fibres of seal's intestines.    \"The tracts they inhabit are altogether destitute of four-footed animals;  they have not domesticated the geese or ducks which abound here; of tillage  they are utterly ignorant; and the only vegetable productions they eat are  a few wild berries and a kind of sea-weed. Their principal food consists of  muscles, limpets, and sea-eggs, and, as often as possible, seal, sea-otter,  porpoise, and whale: we often found in their deserted dwellings bones of  these animals, which had undergone the action of fire.    \"Former voyagers have noticed the avidity with which they swallowed the  most offensive offal, such as decaying seal-skins, {76} rancid seal, and  whale blubber, &c. When on board my ship, they ate or drank greedily  whatever was offered to them, salt-beef, salt-pork, preserved meat,  pudding, pea-soup, tea, coffee, wine, or brandy--nothing came amiss. One  little instance, however, happened, which showed what they preferred. As  they were going ashore, a lump of the tallow used for arming the lead was  given to them, and received with particular delight. It was scrupulously  divided, and placed in the little baskets which they form of rushes, to be  reserved for eating last, as the richest treat.    \"To their dwellings have been given, in various books of voyages, the names  of huts, wigwams, &c.; but, with reference to their structure, I think old  Sir John Narborough's term for them will convey the best idea to an English  reader; he calls them 'arbours.' They are formed of about a couple of dozen  branches, pointed at the larger ends, and stuck into the ground round a  circular or elliptical space, about ten feet by six; the upper ends are  brought together, and secured by tyers of grass, over which is thrown a  thatching of grass and seal-skins, a hole being left at the side as a door,  and another at the top as a vent for the smoke. A fire is kept burning  within, over which the natives are constantly cowering; hence, when seen  abroad, instead of appearing to be hardy savages, inured to wet and cold,  you see wretched creatures shivering at every breeze. I never met people so  sensible of cold as these Fuegian Indians.    \"The nature of their domestic ties we had no opportunity of discovering;  their manner towards their children is affectionate and caressing. I often  witnessed the tenderness with which they tried to quiet the alarms our  presence at first occasioned, and the pleasure which they showed when we  bestowed upon the little ones any trifling trinkets. It appeared that they  allow their children to possess property, and consult their little whims  and wishes, with respect to its disposal; for being in a boat, alongside  one of the canoes, bargaining for various articles, spears, arrows,  baskets, &c., I took a fancy to a dog lying near one of the women, and  offered a price for it; one of my seamen, supposing the bargain concluded,  laid {77} hands on the dog, at which the woman set up a dismal yell; so  bidding him desist, I increased my offers. She declined to part with it,  but would give two others. At last, my offers became so considerable, that  she called a little boy out of the thick jungle (into which he had fled at  our approach), who was the owner of the dog. The goods were shown to him,  and all his party urged him to sell it, but the little urchin would not  consent. He offered to let me have his necklace, and what he received in  exchange was put away in his own little basket.    \"These people never evinced any thankfulness for our presents. Whatever was  offered they 'clutched at,' doubtful of getting it, although held out to  them; and when in their own hand, it was instantly stowed away, as if they  feared it would be recalled.    \"I sometimes tried to discover whether they preferred any particular  colour, and for that purpose held out three strings of beads, black, white,  and red; they clutched at all three, in their usual manner, without showing  any preference.    \"Their pronunciation is exceedingly harsh and guttural; not more than two  words, whose signification was at all ascertained, could be made out,  'sherroo,' a ship, boat, or canoe, and 'peteet,' a child. They have a  wonderful aptitude for imitating the sounds of strange languages: let a  sentence, of even a dozen words, be distinctly pronounced, and they will  repeat it with the utmost precision.    \"Their only articles of traffic, besides such implements and weapons as  they use, are seal and otter skins; and I should say that the quantity of  peltry to be procured from them would be insignificant towards completing  the cargo of a sealing vessel.\"    During the next few days the Beagle was employed in the"]]]
