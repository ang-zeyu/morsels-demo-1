That his observations on the natives  had led him to conclude that although they did not fear death individually,  yet that the relative weight and importance of the different tribes  appeared to be the highest object of their estimation, as each tribe deemed  its strength and security to consist wholly in its powers, aggregately  considered. That his motive for having so long delayed to use violent  measures had arisen from believing, that in every former instance of  hostility, they had acted either from having received injury, or from  misapprehension.    \"To the latter of these causes,\" added he, \"I attribute my own wound,  but in this business of McEntire, I am fully persuaded that they were  unprovoked, and the barbarity of their conduct admits of no extenuation;  for I have separately examined the sergeant, of whose veracity I have the  highest opinion, and the two convicts; and their story is short, simple,  and alike. I have in vain tried to stimulate Baneelon, Colbee, and the  other natives who live among us, to bring in the aggressor. Yesterday,  indeed, they promised me to do it, and actually went away as if bent on  such a design; but Baneelon, instead of directing his steps to Botany Bay,  crossed the harbour in his canoe, in order to draw the foreteeth of some  of the young men; and Colbee, in the room of fulfilling his engagement,  is loitering about the lookout house. Nay, so far from wishing even to  describe faithfully the person of the man who has thrown the spear, they  pretended that he has a distorted foot, which is a palpable falsehood. So  that we have our efforts only to depend upon; and I am resolved to execute  the prisoners who may be brought in, in the most public and exemplary  manner, in the presence of as many of their countrymen as can be collected,  after having explained the cause of such a punishment; and my fixed  determination to repeat it, whenever any future breach of good conduct on  their side shall render it necessary.\"    Here the governor stopped, and addressing himself to me, said if I could  propose any alteration of the orders under which I was to act, he would  patiently listen to me. Encouraged by this condescension, I begged leave  to offer for consideration whether, instead of destroying ten persons,  the capture of six would not better answer all the purposes for which the  expedition was to be undertaken; as out of this number, a part might be  set aside for retaliation; and the rest, at a proper time, liberated, after  having seen the fate of their comrades and being made sensible of the cause  of their own detention.    This scheme, his Excellency was pleased instantly to adopt, adding, \"if  six cannot be taken, let this number be shot. Should you, however, find it  practicable to take so many, I will hang two and send the rest to Norfolk  Island for a certain period, which will cause their countrymen to believe  that we have dispatched them secretly.\" The order was accordingly altered  to its present form; and I took my leave to prepare, after being again  cautioned not to deceive by holding signals of amity.    At four o'clock on the morning of the 14th we marched The detachment  consisted, besides myself, of Captain Hill of the New South Wales Corps,  Lieutenants Poulder and Dawes, of the marines, Mr. Worgan and Mr. Lowes,  surgeons, three sergeants, three corporals, and forty private soldiers,  provided with three days provisions, ropes to bind our prisoners with, and  hatchets and bags to cut off and contain the heads of the slain. By nine  o'clock this terrific procession reached the peninsula at the head of  Botany Bay, but after having walked in various directions until four  o'clock in the afternoon, without seeing a native, we halted for the night.    At daylight on the following morning our search recommenced. We marched in  an easterly direction, intending to fall in with the south-west arm of the  bay, about three miles above its mouth, which we determined to scour, and  thence passing along the head of the peninsula, to proceed to the north  arm, and complete our Search. However, by a mistake of our guides, at half  past seven o'clock instead of finding ourselves on the south-west arm,  we came suddenly upon the sea shore, at the head of the peninsula, about  midway between the two arms. Here we saw five Indians on the beach, whom we  attempted to surround; but they penetrated our design, and before we could  get near enough to effect our purpose, ran off. We pursued; but a  contest between heavy-armed Europeans, fettered by ligatures, and naked  unencumbered Indians, was too unequal to last long. They darted into the  wood and disappeared.    The alarm being given, we were sensible that no hope of success remained,  but by a rapid movement to a little village (if five huts deserve the name)  which we knew stood on the nearest point of the north arm, where possibly  someone unapprised of our approach, might yet be found. Thither we  hastened; but before we could reach it three canoes, filled with Indians,  were seen paddling over in the utmost hurry and trepidation, to the  opposite shore, where universal alarm prevailed. All we could now do was to  search the huts for weapons of war: but we found nothing except fish gigs,  which we left untouched.    On our return to our baggage (which we had left behind under a small guard  near the place where the pursuit had begun) we observed a native fishing in  shallow water not higher than his waist, at the distance of 300 yards from  the land. In such a situation it would not have been easily practicable  either to shoot, or seize him. I therefore determined to pass without  noticing him, as he seemed either from consciousness of his own security,  or from some other cause, quite unintimidated at our appearance. At length  he called to several of us by name, and in spite of our formidable array,  drew nearer with unbounded confidence. Surprised at his behaviour I ordered  a halt, that he might overtake us, fully resolved, whoever he might be,  that he should be suffered to come to us and leave us uninjured. Presently  we found it to be our friend Colbee; and he joined us at once with his  wonted familiarity and unconcern. We asked him where Pimelwi was, and found  that he perfectly comprehended the nature of our errand, for he described  him to have fled to the southward; and to be at such a distance, as had we  known the account to be true, would have prevented our going in search of  him, without a fresh supply of provisions.    When we arrived at our baggage, Colbee sat down, ate, drank, and slept with  us, from ten o'clock until past noon. We asked him several questions about  Sydney, which he had left on the preceding day*; and he told us he had been  present at an operation performed at the hospital, where Mr. White had cut  off a woman's leg. The agony and cries of the poor sufferer he depicted in  a most lively manner.    [*He had it seems visited the governor about noon, after having gained  information from Nanbaree of our march, and for what purpose it was  undertaken. This he did not scruple to tell to the governor; proclaiming  at the same time, a resolution of going to Botany Bay, which his excellency  endeavoured to dissuade him from by every argument he could devise: a  blanket, a hatchet, a jacket, or aught else he would ask for, was offered  to him in vain, if he would not go. At last it was determined to try to eat  him down, by setting before him his favourite food, of which it was hoped  he would feed so voraciously, as to render him incapable of executing his  intention. A large dish of fish was accordingly set before him. But after  devouring a light horseman, and at least five pounds of beef and bread,  even until the sight of food became disgusting to him, he set out on his  journey with such lightness and gaiety, as plainly shewed him to be a  stranger to the horrors of indigestion.]    At one o'clock we renewed our march, and at three halted near a freshwater  swamp, where we resolved to remain until morning: that is, after a day of  severe fatigue, to pass a night of restless inquietude, when weariness is  denied repose by swarms of mosquitoes and sandflies, which in the summer  months bite and sting the traveller, without measure or intermission.    Next morning we bent our steps homeward; and, after wading breast-high  through two arms of the sea, as broad as the Thames at Westminster, were  glad to find ourselves at Sydney, between one and two o'clock in the  afternoon.    The few remarks which I was able to make on the country through which we  had passed, were such as will not tempt adventurers to visit it on the  score of pleasure or advantage. The soil of every part of the peninsula,  which we had traversed, is shallow and sandy, and its productions meagre  and wretched. When forced to quit the sand, we were condemned to drag  through morasses, or to clamber over rocks, unrefreshed by streams, and  unmarked by diversity. Of the soil I brought away several specimens.    Our first expedition having so totally failed, the governor resolved to try  the fate of a second; and the 'painful pre-eminence' again devolved on me.    The orders under which I was commanded to act differing in no respect  from the last, I resolved to try once more to surprise the village  beforementioned. And in order to deceive the natives, and prevent them  from again frustrating our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#18)"],[1,"out the       rivers and the tide from alluvial marshes of exuberant       fertility. The meadows, thus reclaimed, were covered by       richest grasses, or fields of wheat, that yielded fifty and       thirty fold at the harvest. Their houses were built in       clusters, neatly constructed and comfortably furnished, and       around them all kinds of domestic fowls abounded. With the       spinning-wheel and the loom, their women made, of flax from       their own fields, of fleeces from their own flock, coarse,       but sufficient clothing. The few foreign luxuries that were       coveted could be obtained from Annapolis or Louisburgh, in       return for furs, or wheat, or cattle. Thus were the Acadians       happy in their neutrality and in the abundance which they       drew from their native land. They formed, as it were, one       great family. Their morals were of unaffected purity. Love       was sanctified and calmed by the universal custom of early       marriages. The neighbors of the community would assist the       new couple to raise their cottage, while the wilderness       offered land. Their numbers increased, and the colony, which       had begun only as the trading station of a company, with a       monopoly of the fur trade, counted, perhaps, sixteen or       seventeen thousand inhabitants.\"    The transfer of this colony from French to English rule could not fail  to be productive of some untoward results. The native priests feared the  introduction among them of heretical opinions:--the British officers  treated the people with insolent contempt. \"Their papers and records\"  says our historian, \"were taken from them\" by their new masters:--         \"Was their property demanded for the public service? 'they       were not to be bargained with for the payment.' The order       may still be read on the Council records at Halifax. They       must comply, it was written, without making any terms,       'immediately,' or 'the next courier would bring an order for       military execution upon the delinquents.' And when they       delayed in fetching firewood for their oppressors, it was       told them from the governor, 'If they do not do it in proper       time, the soldiers shall absolutely take their houses for       fuel.' The unoffending sufferers submitted meekly to the       tyranny. Under pretence of fearing that they might rise in       behalf of France, or seek shelter in Canada, or convey       provisions to the French garrisons, they were ordered to       surrender their boats and their firearms; and, conscious of       innocence, they gave up their barges and their muskets,       leaving themselves without the means of flight, and       defenceless. Further orders were afterwards given to the       English officers, if the Acadians behaved amiss to punish       them at discretion; if the troops were annoyed, to inflict       vengeance on the nearest, whether the guilty one or       not,--'taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'\"    There is no reason to believe that these atrocious orders were not  executed in the spirit in which they had been conceived. But worse  remained to come:--         \"The Acadians cowered before their masters, hoping       forbearance; willing to take an oath of fealty to England;       in their single-mindedness and sincerity, refusing to pledge       themselves to bear arms against France. The English were       masters of the sea, were undisputed lords of the country,       and could exercise clemency without apprehension. Not a       whisper gave a warning of their purpose till it was ripe for       execution. But it had been 'determined upon' after the       ancient device of Oriental despotism, that the French       inhabitants of Acadia should be carried away into captivity       to other parts of the British dominions. * * France       remembered the descendants of her sons in the hour of their       affliction, and asked that they might have time to remove       from the peninsula with their effects, leaving their lands       to the English; but the answer of the British Minister       claimed them as useful subjects, and refused them the       liberty of transmigration. The inhabitants of Minas and the       adjacent country pleaded with the British officers for the       restitution of their boats and their guns, promising       fidelity, if they could but retain their liberties, and       declaring that not the want of arms, but their conscience,       should engage them not to revolt. 'The memorial,' said       Lawrence in Council, 'is highly arrogant, insidious and       insulting.' The memorialists, at his summons, came       submissively to Halifax. 'You want your canoes for carrying       provisions to the enemy,' said he to them, though he knew no       enemy was left in their vicinity. 'Guns are no part of your       goods,' he continued, 'as by the laws of England all Roman       Catholics are restrained from having arms, and are subject       to penalties if arms are found in their houses. It is not       the language of British subjects to talk of terms with the       Crown, or capitulate about their fidelity and allegiance.       What excuse can you make for your presumption in treating       this government with such indignity as to expound to them       the nature of fidelity? Manifest your obedience by       immediately taking the oaths of allegiance in the common       form before the Council.' The deputies replied that they       would do as the generality of the inhabitants should       determine; and they merely entreated leave to return home       and consult the body of their people. The next day, the       unhappy men, foreseeing the sorrows that menaced them,       offered to swear allegiance unconditionally.\"    But it was now too late. The savage purpose had been formed. That the  cruelty might have no excuse, it happened that while the scheme was  under discussion letters arrived leaving no doubt that all the shores of  the Bay of Fundy were in the possession of the British. It only remained  to be fixed how the exportation should be effected:--         \"To hunt them into the net was impracticable; artifice was       therefore resorted to. By a general proclamation, on one and       the same day, the scarcely conscious victims, 'both old men       and young men, as well as all the lads of ten years of age,'       were peremptorily ordered to assemble at their respective       posts. On the appointed 5th of September, they obeyed. At       Grand Pre, for example, 418 unarmed men came together. They       were marched into the church, and its avenues were closed,       when Winslow, the American commander, placed himself in       their centre, and spoke:--'You are convened together to       manifest to you His Majesty's final resolution to the       French inhabitants of this his province. Your lands, and       tenements, cattle of all kinds, and live stock of all sorts,       are forfeited to the crown, and you yourselves are to be       removed from this his province. I am, through his Majesty's       goodness, directed to allow you liberty to carry off your       money and household goods, as many as you can, without       discommoding the vessels you go in.' And he then declared       them the King's prisoners. Their wives and families shared       their lot; their sons, 527 in number, their daughters, 576;       in the whole, women and babes and old men and children all       included, 1,923 souls. The blow was sudden; they had left       home but for the morning, and they never were to return.       Their cattle were to stay unfed in the stalls, their fires       to die out on their hearths. They had for that first day       even no food for themselves or their children, and were       compelled to beg for bread. The 10th of September was the       day for the embarkation of a part of the exiles. They were       drawn up six deep, and the young men, 161 in number, were       ordered to march first on board the vessel. They could leave       their farms and cottages, the shady rocks on which they had       reclined, their herds and their garners; but nature yearned       within them, and they would not be separated from their       parents. Yet of what avail was the frenzied despair of the       unarmed youth? They had not one weapon; the bayonet drove       them to obey; and they marched slowly and heavily from the       chapel to the shore, between women and children, who       kneeling, prayed for blessings on their heads, they       themselves weeping, and praying, and singing hymns. The       seniors went next; the wives and children must wait till       other transport vessels arrived. The delay had its horrors.       The wretched people left behind were kept together near the       sea, without proper food or raiment, or shelter, till other       ships came to take them away; and December with its       appalling cold had struck the shivering, half-clad,       broken-hearted sufferers before the last of them were       removed. 'The embarkation of the inhabitants goes on but       slowly,' wrote Monckton, from Fort Cumberland, near which he       had burned three hamlets, 'the most part of the wives of the       men we have prisoners are gone off with their children, in       hopes I would not send off their husbands without them.'       Their hope was vain. Near Annapolis, a hundred heads of       families fled to the woods, and a party was detached on the       hunt to bring them in. 'Our soldiers hate them,' wrote an       officer on this occasion, 'and if they can but find a       pretext to kill them, they will.' Did a prisoner seek to       escape, he was shot down by the sentinel. Yet some fled to       Quebec; more than 3,000 had withdrawn to Miramichi and the       region south of the Ristigouche; some found rest on the       banks of the St. John's and its branches; some found a"]]]
