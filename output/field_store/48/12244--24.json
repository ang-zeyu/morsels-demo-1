I feared but one thing,--that they might run in different  directions, that they might invent some new lie, and thus deprive me of  material proof, and of the sorrowful joy of punishing, yes, of executing  them.    \"And to surprise them more quickly, I started on tiptoe for the  dining-room, not through the parlor, but through the hall and the  children's rooms. In the first room slept the little boy. In the second,  the old nurse moved in her bed, and seemed on the point of waking, and  I wondered what she would think when she knew all. And pity for myself  gave me such a pang that I could not keep the tears back. Not to wake  the children, I ran lightly through the hall into my study. I dropped  upon the sofa, and sobbed. 'I, an honest man, I, the son of my parents,  who all my life long have dreamed of family happiness, I who have never  betrayed! . . . And here my five children, and she embracing a musician  because he has red lips! No, she is not a woman! She is a bitch, a dirty  bitch! Beside the chamber of the children, whom she had pretended to  love all her life! And then to think of what she wrote me! And how do  I know? Perhaps it has always been thus. Perhaps all these children,  supposed to be mine, are the children of my servants. And if I had  arrived to-morrow, she would have come to meet me with her coiffure,  with her corsage, her indolent and graceful movements (and I see her  attractive and ignoble features), and this jealous animal would have  remained forever in my heart, tearing it. What will the old nurse say?  And Gregor? And the poor little Lise? She already understands things.  And this impudence, this falsehood, this bestial sensuality, that I know  so well,' I said to myself.    \"I tried to rise. I could not. My heart was beating so violently that  I could not hold myself upon my legs. 'Yes, I shall die of a rush of  blood. She will kill me. That is what she wants. What is it to her to  kill? But that would be too agreeable to him, and I will not allow him  to have this pleasure.    \"Yes, here I am, and there they are. They are laughing, they. . . . Yes,  in spite of the fact that she is no longer in her early youth, he has  not disdained her. At any rate, she is by no means ugly, and above  all, not dangerous to his dear health, to him. Why did I not stifle  her then?' said I to myself, as I remembered that other scene of the  previous week, when I drove her from my study, and broke the furniture.    \"And I recalled the state in which I was then. Not only did I recall it,  but I again entered into the same bestial state. And suddenly there came  to me a desire to act, and all reasoning, except such as was necessary  to action, vanished from my brain, and I was in the condition of a  beast, and of a man under the influence of physical excitement pending a  danger, who acts imperturbably, without haste, and yet without losing a  minute, pursuing a definite object.    \"The first thing that I did was to take off my boots, and now, having  only stockings on, I advanced toward the wall, over the sofa, where  firearms and daggers were hanging, and I took down a curved Damascus  blade, which I had never used, and which was very sharp. I took it from  its sheath. I remember that the sheath fell upon the sofa, and that I  said to myself: 'I must look for it later; it must not be lost.'    \"Then I took off my overcoat, which I had kept on all the time, and with  wolf-like tread started for THE ROOM. I do not remember how I proceeded,  whether I ran or went slowly, through what chambers I passed, how I  approached the dining-room, how I opened the door, how I entered. I  remember nothing about it.\"        CHAPTER XXVII.    \"I Remember only the expression of their faces when I opened the door. I  remember that, because it awakened in me a feeling of sorrowful joy.  It was an expression of terror, such as I desired. Never shall I forget  that desperate and sudden fright that appeared on their faces when they  saw me. He, I believe, was at the table, and, when he saw or heard me,  he started, jumped to his feet, and retreated to the sideboard. Fear  was the only sentiment that could be read with certainty in his face.  In hers, too, fear was to be read, but accompanied by other impressions.  And yet, if her face had expressed only fear, perhaps that which  happened would not have happened. But in the expression of her face  there was at the first moment--at least, I thought I saw it--a feeling  of ennui, of discontent, at this disturbance of her love and happiness.  One would have said that her sole desire was not to be disturbed IN THE  MOMENT OF HER HAPPINESS. But these expressions appeared upon their  faces only for a moment. Terror almost immediately gave place to  interrogation. Would they lie or not? If yes, they must begin. If not,  something else was going to happen. But what?    \"He gave her a questioning glance. On her face the expression of anguish  and ennui changed, it seemed to me, when she looked at him, into an  expression of anxiety for HIM. For a moment I stood in the doorway,  holding the dagger hidden behind my back. Suddenly he smiled, and in a  voice that was indifferent almost to the point of ridicule, he said:    \"'We were having some music.'    \"'I did not expect--,' she began at the same time, chiming in with the  tone of the other.    \"But neither he nor she finished their remarks. The same rage that I had  felt the previous week took possession of me. I felt the need of giving  free course to my violence and 'the joy of wrath.'    \"No, they did not finish. That other thing was going to begin, of which  he was afraid, and was going to annihilate what they wanted to say.  I threw myself upon her, still hiding the dagger, that he might not  prevent me from striking where I desired, in her bosom, under the  breast. At that moment he saw . . . and, what I did not expect on his  part, he quickly seized my hand, and cried:    \"'Come to your senses! What are you doing? Help! Help!'    \"I tore my hands from his grasp, and leaped upon him. I must have been  very terrible, for he turned as white as a sheet, to his lips. His eyes  scintillated singularly, and--again what I did not expect of him--he  scrambled under the piano, toward the other room. I tried to follow him,  but a very heavy weight fell upon my left arm. It was she.    \"I made an effort to clear myself. She clung more heavily than ever,  refusing to let go. This unexpected obstacle, this burden, and this  repugnant touch only irritated me the more. I perceived that I was  completely mad, that I must be frightful, and I was glad of it. With  a sudden impulse, and with all my strength, I dealt her, with my left  elbow, a blow squarely in the face.    \"She uttered a cry and let go my arm. I wanted to follow the other, but  I felt that it would be ridiculous to pursue in my stockings the lover  of my wife, and I did not wish to be grotesque, I wished to be terrible.  In spite of my extreme rage, I was all the time conscious of the  impression that I was making upon others, and even this impression  partially guided me.    \"I turned toward her. She had fallen on the long easy chair, and,  covering her face at the spot where I had struck her, she looked at me.  Her features exhibited fear and hatred toward me, her enemy, such as the  rat exhibits when one lifts the rat-trap. At least, I saw nothing in her  but that fear and hatred, the fear and hatred which love for another had  provoked. Perhaps I still should have restrained myself, and should  not have gone to the last extremity, if she had maintained silence. But  suddenly she began to speak; she grasped my hand that held the dagger.    \"'Come to your senses! What are you doing? What is the matter with you?  Nothing has happened, nothing, nothing! I swear it to you!'    \"I might have delayed longer, but these last words, from which I  inferred the contrary of what they affirmed,--that is, that EVERYTHING  had happened,--these words called for a reply. And the reply must  correspond to the condition into which I had lashed myself, and which  was increasing and must continue to increase. Rage has its laws.    \"'Do not lie, wretch. Do not lie!' I roared.    \"With my left hand I seized her hands. She disengaged herself. Then,  without dropping my dagger, I seized her by the throat, forced her to  the floor, and began to strangle her. With her two hands she clutched  mine, tearing them from her throat, stifling. Then I struck her a blow  with the dagger, in the left side, between the lower ribs.    \"When people say that they do not remember what they do in a fit of  fury, they talk nonsense. It is false. I remember everything.    \"I did not lose my consciousness for a single moment. The more I lashed  myself to fury, the clearer my mind became, and I could not help seeing  what I did. I cannot say that I knew in advance what I would do, but at  the moment when I acted, and it seems to me even a little before, I knew  what I was doing, as if to make it possible to repent, and to be able to  say later that I could have stopped.    \"I knew that I struck the blow between the ribs, and that the dagger  entered.    \"At the second when I did it, I knew that I was performing a horrible  act, such as I had never performed,--an act that would have frightful  consequences. My thought was as quick as lightning, and the deed  followed immediately. The act, to my inner sense, had an extraordinary  clearness. I perceived the resistance of the corset and then something  else, and then the sinking of the knife into a soft substance. She  clutched at the dagger with her hands, and cut herself with it, but  could not restrain the blow.    \"Long afterward, in prison when the moral revolution had been effected  within me, I thought of that minute, I remembered it as far as I could,  and I co-ordinated all the sudden changes. I remembered the terrible  consciousness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#18)"],[1," is a habit, and idleness an artificial  growth.'' Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 30.      The attitude of orthodox Socialism on this question  is quite different from that of Anarchism.[45]  Among the more immediate measures advocated in the  ``Communist Manifesto'' is ``equal liability of all  to labor. Establishment of industrial armies, especially  for agriculture.'' The Socialist theory is that,  in general, work alone gives the right to the enjoyment  of the produce of work. To this theory there  will, of course, be exceptions: the old and the very  young, the infirm and those whose work is temporarily  not required through no fault of their own.  But the fundamental conception of Socialism, in regard  to our present question, is that all who can  should be compelled to work, either by the threat  of starvation or by the operation of the criminal  law. And, of course, the only kind of work recognized  will be such as commends itself to the authorities.  Writing books against Socialism, or against  any theory embodied in the government of the day,  would certainly not be recognized as work. No more  would the painting of pictures in a different style  from that of the Royal Academy, or producing plays  unpleasing to the censor. Any new line of thought  would be banned, unless by influence or corruption  the thinker could crawl into the good graces of the  pundits. These results are not foreseen by Socialists,  because they imagine that the Socialist State  will be governed by men like those who now advocate  it. This is, of course, a delusion. The rulers of the  State then will bear as little resemblance to the pres-  ent Socialists as the dignitaries of the Church after  the time of Constantine bore to the Apostles. The  men who advocate an unpopular reform are exceptional  in disinterestedness and zeal for the public  good; but those who hold power after the reform  has been carried out are likely to belong, in the main,  to the ambitious executive type which has in all ages  possessed itself of the government of nations. And  this type has never shown itself tolerant of opposition  or friendly to freedom.      [45] ``While holding this synthetic view on production, the  Anarchists cannot consider, like the Collectivists, that a  remuneration which would be proportionate to the hours of labor  spent by each person in the production of riches may be an  ideal, or even an approach to an ideal, society.'' Kropotkin,  ``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 20.      It would seem, then, that if the Anarchist plan  has its dangers, the Socialist plan has at least equal  dangers. It is true that the evils we have been foreseeing  under Socialism exist at present, but the purpose  of Socialists is to cure the evils of the world  as it is; they cannot be content with the argument  that they would make things no worse.    Anarchism has the advantage as regards liberty,  Socialism as regards the inducements to work. Can  we not find a method of combining these two advantages?  It seems to me that we can.    We saw that, provided most people work in  moderation, and their work is rendered as productive  as science and organization can make it, there is no  good reason why the necessaries of life should not be  supplied freely to all. Our only serious doubt was  as to whether, in an Anarchist regime, the motives for  work would be sufficiently powerful to prevent a dan-  gerously large amount of idleness. But it would be  easy to decree that, though necessaries should be free  to all, whatever went beyond necessaries should only  be given to those who were willing to work--not, as  is usual at present, only to those in work at any  moment, but also to all those who, when they happened  not to be working, were idle through no fault  of their own. We find at present that a man who  has a small income from investments, just sufficient  to keep him from actual want, almost always prefers  to find some paid work in order to be able to afford  luxuries. So it would be, presumably, in such a  community as we are imagining. At the same time, the  man who felt a vocation for some unrecognized work  of art or science or thought would be free to follow his  desire, provided he were willing to ``scorn delights  and live laborious days.'' And the comparatively  small number of men with an invincible horror of  work--the sort of men who now become tramps--  might lead a harmless existence, without any grave  danger of their becoming sufficiently numerous to be  a serious burden upon the more industrious. In this  ways the claims of freedom could be combined with  the need of some economic stimulus to work. Such  a system, it seems to me, would have a far greater  chance of success than either pure Anarchism or pure  orthodox Socialism.    Stated in more familiar terms, the plan we are  advocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain  small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be  secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a  larger income, as much larger as might be warranted  by the total amount of commodities produced, should  be given to those who are willing to engage in some  work which the community recognizes as useful. On  this basis we may build further. I do not think it  is always necessary to pay more highly work which  is more skilled or regarded as socially more useful,  since such work is more interesting and more respected  than ordinary work, and will therefore often be  preferred by those who are able to do it. But we  might, for instance, give an intermediate income to  those who are only willing to work half the usual  number of hours, and an income above that of most  workers to those who choose a specially disagreeable  trade. Such a system is perfectly compatible with  Socialism, though perhaps hardly with Anarchism.  Of its advantages we shall have more to say at a  later stage. For the present I am content to urge  that it combines freedom with justice, and avoids  those dangers to the community which we have found  to lurk both in the proposals of the Anarchists and  in those of orthodox Socialists.        CHAPTER V    GOVERNMENT AND LAW      GOVERNMENT and Law, in their very essence, consist  of restrictions on freedom, and freedom is the  greatest of political goods.[46] A hasty reasoner might  conclude without further ado that Law and government  are evils which must be abolished if freedom  is our goal. But this consequence, true or false, cannot  be proved so simply. In this chapter we shall  examine the arguments of Anarchists against law and  the State. We shall proceed on the assumption that  freedom is the supreme aim of a good social system;  but on this very basis we shall find the Anarchist  contentions very questionable.      [46] I do not say freedom is the greatest of ALL goods: the best  things come from within--they are such things as creative art,  and love, and thought. Such things can be helped or hindered  by political conditions, but not actually produced by them; and  freedom is, both in itself and in its relation to these other goods  the best thing that political and economic conditions can secure.      Respect for the liberty of others is not a natural  impulse with most men: envy and love of power lead  ordinary human nature to find pleasure in interferences  with the lives of others. If all men's actions  were wholly unchecked by external authority, we  should not obtain a world in which all men would be  free. The strong would oppress the weak, or the  majority would oppress the minority, or the lovers  of violence would oppress the more peaceable people.  I fear it cannot be said that these bad impulses are  WHOLLY due to a bad social system, though it must  be conceded that the present competitive organization  of society does a great deal to foster the worst  elements in human nature. The love of power is an  impulse which, though innate in very ambitious men,  is chiefly promoted as a rule by the actual experience  of power. In a world where none could acquire  much power, the desire to tyrannize would be much  less strong than it is at present. Nevertheless, I  cannot think that it would be wholly absent, and  those in whom it would exist would often be men of  unusual energy and executive capacity. Such men,  if they are not restrained by the organized will of  the community, may either succeed in establishing  a despotism, or, at any rate, make such a vigorous  attempt as can only be defeated through a period  of prolonged disturbance. And apart from the love  or political power, there is the love of power over  individuals. If threats and terrorism were not prevented  by law, it can hardly be doubted that cruelty would  be rife in the relations of men and women, and of  parents and children. It is true that the habits of  a community can make such cruelty rare, but these  habits, I fear, are only to be produced through the  prolonged reign of law. Experience of backwoods  communities, mining camps and other such places  seems to show that under new conditions men easily  revert to a more barbarous attitude and practice.  It would seem, therefore, that, while human nature  remains as it is, there will be more liberty for all in a  community where some acts of tyranny by individuals  are forbidden, than in a community where the law  leaves each individual free to follow his every impulse.  But, although the necessity of some form of government  and law must for the present be conceded, it is  important to remember that all law and government  is in itself in some degree an evil, only justifiable when  it prevents other and greater evils. Every use of the  power of the State needs, therefore, to be very closely  scrutinized, and every possibility of diminishing its  power is to be welcomed provided it does not lead to  a reign of private tyranny.    The power of the State is partly legal, partly  economic: acts of a kind which the State dislikes can"]]]
