In the fourth century matters became still worse. The public  supplications by which the pagans were accustomed to appease their  gods, were borrowed from them, and were celebrated in many places  with great pomp. To the temples, to water consecrated in due form,  and the images of holy men, the same efficacy was ascribed and the  same privileges assigned as had been attributed to the pagan temples,  statues and lustrations before the advent of Christ. [4]    In the third century also arose the worship of martyrs. It is true  that worship or adoration was relative, and a distinction was made  between the worship of martyrs and the worship paid to God; but by  degrees the worship of martyrs was made to conform with that which the  pagans had in former times paid to their gods. [5] This was done out of  indiscreet eagerness to allure the pagans to embrace Christianity. [6]  \"When Gregory [surnamed Thaumaturgus on account of the numerous miracle  she is said to have wrought--born in Pontus, in the second decade of  the third century] perceived that the ignorant and simple multitude  persisted in their idolatry, on account of the sensuous pleasures and  delights it afforded--he allowed them in celebrating the memory of  the holy martyrs, to indulge themselves and give a loose to pleasure  (i. e., as the thing itself, and both what precedes and what follows,  place beyond all controversy, he allowed them at the sepulchres of  the martyrs on their feast days, to dance, to use sports, to indulge  in conviviality, and do all things that the worshipers of idols were  accustomed to do in their temples, on their festival days), hoping  that in process of time they would spontaneously come over to a more  becoming and correct manner of life.\" [7]    While pagan rites and ceremonies were increasing in the church, the  gifts and graces characteristic of apostolic times, seemed to have  gradually departed from it. Protestant writers insist that the age  of miracles closed with the fourth or fifth century, and that after  that the extra-ordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost must not be expected.  Catholic writers, on the other hand, insist that miracles have always  continued in the church; yet those spiritual manifestations which they  describe after the fourth and fifth centuries savor of invention on the  part of the priests and childish credulity on the part of the people;  or else what is claimed to be miraculous falls far short of the power  and dignity of those spiritual manifestations which the primitive  church was wont to witness. The virtues and prodigies ascribed to  the bones and other relics of the martyrs and saints are purile in  comparison with the healings, by the anointing with oil and the  laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, interpretations, prophecies,  revelations, casting out devils in the name of Jesus Christ; to say  nothing of the gifts of faith, wisdom, knowledge, discernment of  spirits, etc., common in the church in the days of the apostles. [8]  There is nothing in the scriptures or in reason that would lead one to  believe that the miraculous gifts were to be discontinued. Still this  plea is made by modern Christians--explaining the absence of these  spiritual powers among them--that the extraordinary gifts of the Holy  Ghost were only intended to accompany the proclamation of the gospel  during the first few centuries until the church was able to make its  way without them, and then they were to be done away. It is sufficient  to remark upon this that it is assumption and stands without warrant  either of scripture or right reason, and proves that men had so far  changed the religion of Jesus Christ that it became a form of godliness  without the power thereof. [9]    It appears to have been the custom of the apostles in the case of  members of the church grievously transgressing the moral law of the  gospel, to require repentance and confession before the church;  and in the event of a stubborn adherence to sin the offender was  excommunicated, that is, he was excluded from the communion of the  church and the fellowship of the saints. For the crimes of murder,  idolatry and adultery some of the churches excommunicated those guilty  of them forever; in other churches they were received back, but only  after long and painful probation.    The manner in which excommunication was performed in apostolic times  is not clear, but there is every reason to believe the process was  very simple. In the course of time, however, this simple form of  excommunication was changed, by being burdened with many rites and  ceremonies borrowed from pagan sources. [10] It was not enough that the  fellowship of the saints be withdrawn from the offender and he left  to the mercy of God, or the buffetings of Satan, according as he was  worthy of the one or the other; but the church must load him down with  anathemas too terrible to contemplate. The power of excommunication,  too, eventually, passed from the body of the church into the hands  of the bishops, and finally into those of the pope. At first  excommunication meant the loss of the fellowship of the saints and such  other punishment as God Himself might see proper to inflict; the church  leaving the Lord to be the minister of His own vengeance. But gradually  it came to mean in some instances banishment from home and country, the  confiscation of property, the loss not only of church fellowship, but  loss of civil rights and the rights of Christian burial. In the case of  a monarch, excommunication absolved his subjects from their allegiance;  and in the case of a subject, it robbed him of the protection of his  sovereign. No anathema was so terrible but it was pronounced against  the excommunicated, until the sweet mercies of God were overshadowed by  the black pall of man's inhumanity.    The outward ordinances of the gospel consisted of baptism, the laying  on of hands for the imparting of the Holy Ghost, and the Lord's supper.  The laying on of hands was also employed in ordaining men to the  priesthood and in administering to the sick. In the latter case it was  accompanied by anointing with oil.    Baptism was administered by immersing the candidate in water. The only  pre-requisites were faith in Jesus Christ and repentance.    As soon as the candidate professed these he was admitted into the  church by baptism. [11] In a short time, however, the simplicity of  this ordinance was corrupted and burdened with useless ceremonies.  In the second century the newly baptized converts, since by baptism  they had been born again, were taught to exhibit in their conduct  the innocence of little infants. Milk and honey, the common food of  infants, were administered to them, after their baptism, to remind them  of their infancy in the church. Moreover, since by baptism they were  released from being servants of the devil, and became God's free men,  certain forms borrowed from the Roman ceremony of manumission of slaves  was employed in baptism. As by baptism also they were supposed to be  made God's soldiers, like newly enlisted soldiers in the Roman army,  they were sworn to obey their commander. [12] A century later (the  third) further ceremonies were added. It was supposed that some evil  spirit was resident in all vicious persons and impelled them to sin.  Therefore, before entering the sacred fount for baptism, an exorcist  by a solemn, menacing formula declared them free from the bondage of  Satan, and hailed them servants of Christ. [13] After baptism the new  converts returned home \"decorated with a crown and a white robe; the  first being indicative of their victory over the world and their lusts,  the latter of their acquired innocence.\" [14] We have already noted  the fact that baptism was administered in the days of the apostles as  soon as profession of faith and repentance was made, but in the second  and third centuries baptism was only administered twice a year, and  then only to such candidates as had gone through a long preparation and  trial. [15] The times chosen for the administration of the ordinance  were on the vigils of Easter and Whitsuntide, [16] and in the fourth  century it had become the custom to accompany the ceremony with lighted  wax candles, to put salt--an emblem of purity and wisdom--in the mouth  of the baptized, and everywhere a double anointing was administered to  the candidates, the one before the other after baptism. [17]    It must have been early in the third century that the form of baptism  began to be changed. Up to this time it had been performed only by  immersion of the whole body. But in the first half of the third  century, Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, during a controversy respecting  the re-baptism of those who in times of persecution had denied the  faith, decided that those whose weak state of health did not permit  them to be immersed, were sufficiently baptized by being sprinkled.  [18] The first case of this kind of baptism is related by Eusebius. The  person to whom it was so administered was Novatus, a desperate heretic,  who created a schism in the church and became the founder of a sect.  He was among the number of so-called Christians who put off baptism  as long as he dared; in order to enjoy a life of sin and then through  baptism, just before death, obtain forgiveness--a custom very prevalent  in those times. Novatus being attacked with an obstinate disease, and  supposed to be at the point of death, was baptized by having water  sprinkled upon him as he lay in bed; \"if indeed,\" says Eusebius, \"it be  proper to say one like him did receive baptism.\" [19]    This innovation continued to spread until now the general rule among  Christians is to baptize by sprinkling or pouring.

The apology for the life of the 'Limited Edition'  brought to its logical conclusion was this: Times have changed, and,  moreover, more people buy books than formerly, whether to read or to  store.  With the readers we have nothing to do, except incidentally; but  so far as the collectors are concerned, it is obvious that only about  one out of every ten can afford to pay the extremely high prices  demanded for most of the first editions of the authors of repute which  they affect.    Now comes the point, and upon this the whole argument succeeds or fails.  Do they want these coveted books to read or to accumulate?  If they wish  to read them they can do so at any time, for there are more editions  than one in the majority of instances, and the demand for the later and  cheaper ones is of a different character altogether; ergo, they really  want them, though they would perhaps be highly indignant if we said so,  to possess and not necessarily to read.  Let us, therefore, make new  books in the image of the old, decorating them artistically, and  printing them in the best possible style.  Let us cut down the edition  to a very small number of copies, in order to keep it out of the hands  of all but just enough buyers to make the venture pay well, and we ought  to succeed in establishing a furore that will continue precisely as long  as the strenuous efforts to obtain time-tried poems and essays remain  futile by reason of their cost.    The venture was purposely confined to poems and essays, because literary  wares of this kind good enough for the purpose could be bought for next  to nothing.  A novel, in order to compete on this particular ground with  the older works of Ainsworth, Thackeray, and the rest, would be costly  to buy in manuscript, and difficult as well as expensive to produce;  and, moreover, novels never pay unless they are sold in large  quantities. This argument was sound throughout, and, moreover, a fresh  departure of some kind was inevitable, if only to stem the tide that  flowed so aggressively in favour of the rich.  The venture succeeded,  for almost on the instant the collector, casting a lingering look behind  on the expensive works for which he craved, turned away from them, and  welcomed the 'dainty volumes of delicious verse' which came tumbling  down in almost endless variety.  There was a scramble for them which  continued exactly as long as had been predicted, namely, until the  prices of once coveted books began to fall, and then the 'Limited  Editions' fell too, and the craze was over, for the present at least.    One would have thought that the direct result of this procedure would  have been a fresh rush to former fields, but the fact is otherwise.  Original editions of the works of older poets and essayists of the  highest repute are still as costly as ever, but the general ruck have  fallen in the market, and remain fallen to this present day.  More than  that, the 'Limited Edition' brought within reasonable access innumerable  better books, now become cheaper, provided they are not in the very  finest condition.    Just at the moment there is no great 'boom' observable in the English  market, no great craze for books of a certain special kind, though some,  as usual, are sought for unceasingly, as, for example, many of those  older works of English literature which were seen in such profusion in  the collection of Mr. Charles B. Foote, dispersed in New York at the  beginning of 1895.    Whatever hard things may be said of collectors, however much they may be  likened to literary jackdaws, or to what extent their tastes may be  criticised and compared with those of other people, they have a  virtue--and a great one--one undisputed virtue, which, like charity,  covereth a multitude of sins.  This cardinal virtue is, that now, as in  past times, their primary aim is to appraise literature at its true  worth, and to make that the _raison d'etre_ of their enterprise.  The  inevitable red herring may lead them, for the moment, away from the  pleasant places they have made their home, but it has never yet  prevented their return.    And this home is among time-tried and intrinsically valuable books, and  not among those which are temporarily in vogue.  It is a home which  existed in Greece, and in Rome, and all through the so-called Dark Ages,  during the Renaissance, and down the centuries which succeeded right to  this present year of grace--a home furnished with genius and perfumed  with sentiment. Look there at Paul Lacroix snatching from a Paris stall  the very copy of 'Le Tartuffe' which had belonged to King Louis XIV.,  and later on sheltering not merely the great Pixerecourt founder of the  Societe des Bibliophiles Francais, but his whole library as well, until  such time as his creditors had drawn off their legions and departed.  Sentiment, as well as a passion for literature, was at the bottom of  these acts, for that very copy of 'Le Tartuffe' had been in Moliere's  coat-pocket, and Pixerecourt had a tale to tell of every scholarly  volume he possessed. You cannot manufacture genuine sentiment, nor is  the quality to be evolved from anything except genius.    Accordingly, we find that every book which excites the cupidity of the  true bibliophile derives its magic power primarily from within, and that  this power is often materially increased by reason of extraneous  considerations.  The instances in which external matters have at any  time been capable of investing an inferior book with a halo of  importance or romance are so extremely rare that they might almost be  counted on the fingers. A mere fleeting craze cannot do it, and it is  the greatest mistake in the world to suppose that a scarce book would be  sought for, and prized when found, merely because it is scarce, and for  no other reason.  As every book-collector is aware, there are hundreds  and thousands of volumes lying neglected on the book-stalls to-day which  would never be there if this were not so.  Some are scarce in the sense  of being difficult to meet with when wanted, but, if that be their only  merit, it has never yet been acknowledged.    But fashion, though it can never make a bad book good, has the power to  subordinate one good book to another, notwithstanding, and to play  shuttlecock with the names of authors and printers alike.  It was  fashion in excelsis which lived with the Elzevirs when men were saying  to one another, 'I have all the poets they ever printed.  I have ten  examples of every volume, and all have red letters, and are of the right  date.'  It was fashion, too, which assessed the value of Longpierre's  copy of Montaigne's 'Essais' (1659), with the buffalo's head on the  preface and at the commencement of each chapter, at 5,100 francs, and  only the other day (March 20, 1896) flung away a fine tall copy, bound  by Bozerian, for the paltry sum of L6 15s.    The same capricious mistress assessed Sir Walter Raleigh's 'Discoverie  of the Large, Rich and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana,' 1626, at a  comparatively low rate--L3 3s., if the late Mr. Henry Stevens is to be  believed, and no one had a greater knowledge of such books than he--in  1858, notwithstanding the fact that it must be credited to Shakespeare's  library, as the 'still vex'd Bermoothes,' and his knowledge of the  breaking of the sea on the rugged rocks by which the Bermuda Islands are  surrounded, sufficiently demonstrate. Thirty years ago Smith's 'Generall  Historie of Virginia,' published for M. Sparkes in 1625, could have been  got for a twentieth part of the sum that would be asked for it now, and  this too is by Fashion's decree.    But in these and any number of typical instances there is no change in  the estimation in which good literature is held; no lifting a book from  an abyss of mediocrity and placing it on a pinnacle of fame.  Fashion  may swing men's minds to this or to that, and so indirectly and for the  time being cause those ups and downs in the book-market which are the  despair of everyone who has endeavoured to account for them, but further  than this she cannot go.    And therefore, when I said that book-men are swayed by fashion, I meant  that their tastes and inclinations are capricious, and not that they  would, even if they could, enter upon the task of passing judgment upon  the verdict of the world.  Fashion may and does make rules which cannot  be broken with impunity, so far as the pocket is concerned; it may even  create an extraordinary and exceptional interest in one author to-day,  and abandon him to-morrow, and do many other wonderful things to cause  our unsympathetic neighbours to blaspheme; but the romance of  book-collecting would be no romance were it stolidly kept at one dead  level of insensibility.  To employ a homely illustration--Fashion may  decorate a house, it can neither build one nor raze one to the ground.                                      *CHAPTER VIII.*                           *THE RULES OF THE CHASE.*      There was a time, and that not so very many years ago, when old books  were, if only you got out of the central mart, difficult to procure, and  by no means easy to store. They were frequently in folio, huge ponderous  works which, unless they were of the very best, challenged the courage  of all but veterans, as they looked down from their dark corners.  There  was no escaping them, no getting away from their costly presence, and no  reading them either without sitting at a table; for 'literary machines'  were not then invented, and no one seemed to care about lingering with  arched back over a fire, with sixty or eighty pounds weight of paper on  his knees. Such a discipline would have been valuable, no doubt, but  learning grew lazy when it left the monasteries, and a table"]]]
