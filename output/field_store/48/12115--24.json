But with their opposite  characteristics both were great and successful soldiers; both were true,  patriotic and upright in all their dealings.  Both were pleasant to  serve under--Taylor was pleasant to serve with.  Scott saw more through  the eyes of his staff officers than through his own.  His plans were  deliberately prepared, and fully expressed in orders.  Taylor saw for  himself, and gave orders to meet the emergency without reference to how  they would read in history.        CHAPTER XI.    ADVANCE ON THE CITY OF MEXICO--BATTLE OF CONTRERAS--ASSAULT AT  CHURUBUSCO--NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE--BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL REY--STORMING  OF CHAPULTEPEC--SAN COSME--EVACUATION OF THE CITY--HALLS OF THE  MONTEZUMAS.    The route followed by the army from Puebla to the City of Mexico was  over Rio Frio mountain, the road leading over which, at the highest  point, is about eleven thousand feet above tide water. The pass through  this mountain might have been easily defended, but it was not; and the  advanced division reached the summit in three days after leaving Puebla.  The City of Mexico lies west of Rio Frio mountain, on a plain backed by  another mountain six miles farther west, with others still nearer on the  north and south.  Between the western base of Rio Frio and the City of  Mexico there are three lakes, Chalco and Xochimilco on the left and  Texcoco on the right, extending to the east end of the City of Mexico.  Chalco and Texcoco are divided by a narrow strip of land over which the  direct road to the city runs.  Xochimilco is also to the left of the  road, but at a considerable distance south of it, and is connected with  Lake Chalco by a narrow channel.  There is a high rocky mound, called El  Penon, on the right of the road, springing up from the low flat ground  dividing the lakes.  This mound was strengthened by intrenchments at its  base and summit, and rendered a direct attack impracticable.    Scott's army was rapidly concentrated about Ayotla and other points near  the eastern end of Lake Chalco.  Reconnoissances were made up to within  gun-shot of El Penon, while engineers were seeking a route by the south  side of Lake Chalco to flank the city, and come upon it from the south  and south-west.  A way was found around the lake, and by the 18th of  August troops were in St. Augustin Tlalpam, a town about eleven miles  due south from the plaza of the capital.  Between St. Augustin Tlalpam  and the city lie the hacienda of San Antonio and the village of  Churubusco, and south-west of them is Contreras.  All these points,  except St. Augustin Tlalpam, were intrenched and strongly garrisoned.  Contreras is situated on the side of a mountain, near its base, where  volcanic rocks are piled in great confusion, reaching nearly to San  Antonio.  This made the approach to the city from the south very  difficult.    The brigade to which I was attached--Garland's, of Worth's division--was  sent to confront San Antonio, two or three miles from St. Augustin  Tlalpam, on the road to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  The ground  on which San Antonio stands is completely in the valley, and the surface  of the land is only a little above the level of the lakes, and, except  to the south-west, it was cut up by deep ditches filled with water.  To  the south-west is the Pedregal--the volcanic rock before spoken of--over  which cavalry or artillery could not be passed, and infantry would make  but poor progress if confronted by an enemy.  From the position occupied  by Garland's brigade, therefore, no movement could be made against the  defences of San Antonio except to the front, and by a narrow causeway,  over perfectly level ground, every inch of which was commanded by the  enemy's artillery and infantry.  If Contreras, some three miles west and  south, should fall into our hands, troops from there could move to the  right flank of all the positions held by the enemy between us and the  city.  Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding of  the front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders.    On the 18th of August, the day of reaching San Augustin Tlalpam,  Garland's brigade secured a position within easy range of the advanced  intrenchments of San Antonio, but where his troops were protected by an  artificial embankment that had been thrown up for some other purpose  than defense.  General Scott at once set his engineers reconnoitring the  works about Contreras, and on the 19th movements were commenced to get  troops into positions from which an assault could be made upon the force  occupying that place.  The Pedregal on the north and north-east, and the  mountain on the south, made the passage by either flank of the enemy's  defences difficult, for their work stood exactly between those natural  bulwarks; but a road was completed during the day and night of the 19th,  and troops were got to the north and west of the enemy.    This affair, like that of Cerro Gordo, was an engagement in which the  officers of the engineer corps won special distinction.  In fact, in  both cases, tasks which seemed difficult at first sight were made easier  for the troops that had to execute them than they would have been on an  ordinary field.  The very strength of each of these positions was, by  the skill of the engineers, converted into a defence for the assaulting  parties while securing their positions for final attack.  All the troops  with General Scott in the valley of Mexico, except a part of the  division of General Quitman at San Augustin Tlalpam and the brigade of  Garland (Worth's division) at San Antonio, were engaged at the battle of  Contreras, or were on their way, in obedience to the orders of their  chief, to reinforce those who were engaged.  The assault was made on the  morning of the 20th, and in less than half an hour from the sound of the  advance the position was in our hands, with many prisoners and large  quantities of ordnance and other stores. The brigade commanded by  General Riley was from its position the most conspicuous in the final  assault, but all did well, volunteers and regulars.    From the point occupied by Garland's brigade we could see the progress  made at Contreras and the movement of troops toward the flank and rear  of the enemy opposing us.  The Mexicans all the way back to the city  could see the same thing, and their conduct showed plainly that they did  not enjoy the sight.  We moved out at once, and found them gone from our  immediate front.  Clarke's brigade of Worth's division now moved west  over the point of the Pedregal, and after having passed to the north  sufficiently to clear San Antonio, turned east and got on the causeway  leading to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  When he approached  Churubusco his left, under Colonel Hoffman, attacked a tete-de-pont at  that place and brought on an engagement.  About an hour after, Garland  was ordered to advance directly along the causeway, and got up in time  to take part in the engagement.  San Antonio was found evacuated, the  evacuation having probably taken place immediately upon the enemy seeing  the stars and stripes waving over Contreras.    The troops that had been engaged at Contreras, and even then on their  way to that battle-field, were moved by a causeway west of, and parallel  to the one by way of San Antonio and Churubusco.  It was expected by the  commanding general that these troops would move north sufficiently far  to flank the enemy out of his position at Churubusco, before turning  east to reach the San Antonio road, but they did not succeed in this,  and Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in the  valley of Mexico.  General Scott coming upon the battle-field about this  juncture, ordered two brigades, under Shields, to move north and turn  the right of the enemy.  This Shields did, but not without hard fighting  and heavy loss.  The enemy finally gave way, leaving in our hands  prisoners, artillery and small arms.  The balance of the causeway held  by the enemy, up to the very gates of the city, fell in like manner.  I  recollect at this place that some of the gunners who had stood their  ground, were deserters from General Taylor's army on the Rio Grande.    Both the strategy and tactics displayed by General Scott in these  various engagements of the 20th of August, 1847, were faultless as I  look upon them now, after the lapse of so many years.  As before stated,  the work of the engineer officers who made the reconnoissances and led  the different commands to their destinations, was so perfect that the  chief was able to give his orders to his various subordinates with all  the precision he could use on an ordinary march.  I mean, up to the  points from which the attack was to commence.  After that point is  reached the enemy often induces a change of orders not before  contemplated.  The enemy outside the city outnumbered our soldiery quite  three to one, but they had become so demoralized by the succession of  defeats this day, that the City of Mexico could have been entered  without much further bloodshed.  In fact, Captain Philip Kearney  --afterwards a general in the war of the rebellion--rode with a squadron  of cavalry to the very gates of the city, and would no doubt have  entered with his little force, only at that point he was badly wounded,  as were several of his officers.  He had not heard the call for a halt.    General Franklin Pierce had joined the army in Mexico, at Puebla, a  short time before the advance upon the capital commenced.  He had  consequently not been in any of the engagements of the war up to the  battle of Contreras.  By an unfortunate fall of his horse on the  afternoon of the 19th he was painfully injured.  The next day, when his  brigade, with the other troops engaged on the same field, was ordered  against the flank and rear of the enemy guarding the different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#18)"],[1,"\"Love the Giver\" on it. Ma knew a man once who could do  them, quick as wink. He died a drunkard with delirium trimmings, but  was terrible smart.    Then she stuck, under the string, a letter she had written to Camilla.  Camilla would get them sent to Polly.    \"I know how to get them sent to Camilla too, you bet,\" she murmured.  \"There are two ways, both good ones, too. Jim Russell is one way. Jim  knows what flowers are to folks.\"    She crept softly down the stairs. Mrs Motherwell had left the kitchen  and no one was about. The men were all down at the barn.    She turned around the cookhouse where the poppies stood straight and  strong against the glowing sky. A little single red one with white  edges swayed gently on its slender stem and seemed to beckon to her  with pleading insistence. She hurried past them, fearing that she would  be seen, but looking back the little poppy was still nodding and  pleading.    \"And so ye can go, ye sweetheart,\" she whispered. \"I know what ye  want.\" She came back for it.    \"Just like Danny would be honin' to come, if it was me,\" she murmured  with a sudden blur of homesickness.    Through the pasture she flew with the speed of a deer. The tall  sunflowers along the fence seemed to throw a light in the gathering  gloom.    A night hawk circled in the air above her, and a clumsy bat came  bumping through the dusk as she crossed the creek just below Jim's  shanty.    Bottles, Jim's dog, jumped up and barked, at which Jim himself came to  the door.    \"Come back, Bottles,\" he called to the dog. \"How will I ever get into  society if you treat callers that way, and a lady, too! Dear, dear, is  my tie on straight? Oh, is that you Pearl? Come right in, I am glad to  see you.\"    Over the door of Jim's little house the words \"Happy Home\" were printed  in large letters and just above the one little window another sign  boldly and hospitably announced \"Hot Meals at all Hours.\"    Pearl stopped at the door. \"No, Jim,\" she said, \"it's not visitin' I  am, but I will go in for a minute, for I must put this flower in the  box. Can ye go to town, Jim, in a hurry?\"    \"I can,\" Jim replied.    \"I mean now, this very minute, slappet-bang!\"    Jim started for the door.    \"Howld on, Jim!\" Pearl cried, \"don't you want to hear what ye'r goin'  for? Take this box to Camilla--Camilla E. Rose at Mrs. Francis's--and  she'll do the rest. It's flowers for poor Polly, sick and dyin' maybe  with the fever. But dead or alive, flowers are all right for folks,  ain't they, Jim? The train goes at ten o'clock. Can ye do it, Jim?\"    Jim was brushing his hair with one hand and reaching for his coat with  the other.    \"Here's the money to pay for the ride on the cars,\" Pearl said,  reaching out five of her coins.    Jim waved his hand.    \"That's my share of it,\" he said, pulling his cap down on his head.  \"You see, you do the first part, then me, then Camilla--just like the  fiery cross.\" He was half way to the stable as he spoke.    He threw the saddle on Chiniquy and was soon galloping down the road  with the box under his arm.    Camilla came to the door in answer to Jim's ring.    He handed her the box, and lifting his hat was about to leave without a  word, when Camilla noticed the writing.    \"From Pearl,\" she said eagerly. \"How is Pearl? Come in, please, while I  read the letter--it may require an answer.\"    Camilla wore a shirt-waist suit of brown, and the neatest collar and  tie, and Jim suddenly became conscious that his boots were not  blackened.    Camilla left him in the hall, while she went into the library and read  the contents of the letter to Mr. and Mrs. Francis.    She returned presently and with a pleasant smile said, holding out her  hand, \"You are Mr. Russell. I am glad to meet you. Tell Pearl the  flowers will be sent to-night.\"    She opened the door as she spoke, and Jim found himself going down the  steps, wondering just how it happened that he had not said one word--he  who was usually so ready of speech.    \"Well, well,\" he said to himself as he untied Chiniquy, \"little Jimmy's  lost his tongue, I wonder why?\"    All the way home the vision of lovely dark eyes and rippling brown hair  with just a hint of red in it, danced before him. Chiniquy, taking  advantage of his master's preoccupation, wandered aimlessly against a  barbed wire, taking very good care not to get too close to it himself.  Jim came to himself just in time to save his leg from a prod from the  spikes.    \"Chiniquy, Chiniquy,\" he said gravely, \"I understand now something of  the hatred the French bear your illustrious namesake. But no matter  what the man's sins may have been, surely he did not deserve to have a  little flea-bitten, mangey, treacherous, mouse-coloured deceiver like  you named for him.\"    When Camilla had read Pearl's letter to Mr. and Mrs. Francis, the  latter was all emotion. How splendid of her, so sympathetic, so full of  the true inwardness of Christian love, and the sweet message of the  poppy, the emblem of sleep, so prophetic of that other sleep that knows  no waking! Is it not a pagan thought, that? What tender recollections  they will bring the poor sufferer of her far away, happy childhood home!    Mrs. Francis's face was shining with emotion as she spoke. Then she  became dreamy.    \"I wonder is her soul attune to the melodies of life, and will she feel  the love vibrations of the ether?\"    Mr. Francis had noiselessly left the room when Camilla had finished her  rapid explanation. He returned with his little valise in his hand.    He stood a moment irresolutely looking, in his helpless dumb way, at  his wife, who was so beautifully expounding the message of the flowers.    Camilla handed him the box. She understood.    Mrs. Francis noticed the valise in her husband's hand.    \"How very suddenly you make up your mind, James,\" she said. \"Are you  actually going away on the train to-night? Really James, I believe I  shall write a little sketch for our church paper. Pearl's  thoughtfulness has moved me, James. It really has touched me deeply. If  you were not so engrossed in business, James, I really believe it would  move you; but men are so different from us, Camilla. They are not so  soulful. Perhaps it is just as well, but really sometimes, James, I  fear you give business too large a place in your life. It is all  business, business, business.\"    Mrs. Francis opened her desk, and drawing toward her her gold pen and  dainty letter paper, began her article.    Camilla followed Mr. Francis into the hall, and helped him to put on  his overcoat. She handed him his hat with something like reverence in  her manner.    \"You are upon the King's business to-night,\" she said, with shining  eyes, as she opened the door for him.    He opened his mouth as if to speak, but only waved his hand with an  impatient gesture and was gone.        CHAPTER XVI    HOW POLLY WENT HOME    \"We'll have to move poor Polly, if she lives thro' the night,\" the  nurse said to the house doctor in the hospital that night. \"She is  making all the patients homesick. To hear her calling for her mother or  for 'someone from 'ome' is hard on the sick and well.\"    \"What are her chances do you think?\" the doctor asked gravely.    He was a wiry little man with a face like leather, but his touch  brought healing and his presence, hope.    \"She is dying of homesickness as well as typhoid,\" the nurse said  sadly, \"and she seems so anxious to get better, poor thing! She often  says 'I can't die miss, for what'll happen mother.' But for the last  two days, in her delirium, she seems to be worrying more about her work  and her flowers. I think they were pretty hard people she lived with.  'Surely she'll praise me this time,' she often says, 'I've tried my  'ardest.' The strenuous life has been too much for poor Polly. Listen  to her now!\"    Polly was singing. Clear and steady and sweet, her voice rang over the  quiet ward, and many a fevered face was raised to listen. Polly's mind  was wandering in the shadows, but she still sang the songs of home in a  strange land:       Down by the biller there grew a green willer     A weeping all night with the bank for a piller.    And over and over again she sang with a wavering cadence, incoherently  sometimes, but always with tender pleading, something about \"where the  stream was a-flowin', the gentle kine lowin', and over my grave keep  the green willers growin'.\"    \"It is pathetic to hear her,\" the nurse said, \"and now listen to her  asking about her poppies.\"    \"In the box, miss; I brought the seed hacross the hocean, and they wuz  beauties, they wuz wot came hup. They'll be noddin' and wavin' now red  and 'andsome, if she hasn't cut them. She wouldn't cut them, would she,  miss? She couldn't 'ave the 'eart, I think.\"    \"No indeed, she hasn't cut them,\" the nurse declared with decision,  taking Polly's burning hand tenderly in hers. \"No one could cut down  such beauties. What nonsense to think of such a thing, Polly. They're  blooming, I tell you, red and handsome, almost as tall as you are,  Polly.\"    The office-boy touched the nurse's arm.    \"A gentleman who gave no name left this box for one of the typhoid  patients,\" he said, handing her the box.    The nurse read the address and the box trembled in her hands as she  nervously opened it and took out the contents.    \"Polly, Polly!\" she cried, excitedly, \"didn't I tell you they were  blooming, red and handsome.\"    But Polly's eyes were burning with delirium and her lips babbled  meaninglessly.    The nurse held the poppies over her.    Her arms reached out caressingly.    \"Oh, miss!\" she cried, her mind coming back from the shadows. \"They  have come at last, the darlin's, the sweethearts, the loves, the  beauties.\" She held them in a close embrace. \"They're from 'ome,  they're from 'ome!\" she gasped painfully, for her breath came with  difficulty now. \"I can't just see them, miss, the lights is movin' so  much, and "]]]
