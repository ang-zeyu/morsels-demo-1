Average and extreme cranial measurements of 15 adults  from 9-1/2 mi. W New Mexico State Line, 5-1/2 mi. N Mexican border,  Cochise County, Arizona, are as follows: occipitonasal length, 18.0  (17.5-18.6); zygomatic breadth, 9.5 (9.2-9.9); postpalatal length, 6.6  (6.0-7.1); least interorbital breadth, 3.6 (3.4-3.8); length of incisive  foramina, 4.0 (3.8-4.2); length of rostrum, 6.1 (5.7-6.4); breadth of  braincase, 8.6 (8.4-9.1); depth of cranium, 6.5 (6.3-6.9); alveolar  length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.2 (3.1-3.4). Average and extreme  external measurements for six adults from 9 mi. W Hereford, Cochise  County, are as follows: total length, 106.3 (98-115); length of tail  vertebrae, 42.3 (39-46); length of body, 64 (59-69); length of hind  foot, 13.6 (13-14.2); length of ear from notch, 11.1 (10.5-11.5); for  photographs of skull, see Plate 2_b_, and Plate 4_c_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. t. canutus_, see account of  that subspecies. From _B. t. paulus_, the subspecies to the southeast,  _B. t. ater_ differs in: dorsum darker brown; tail less strikingly  bicolored; belly buffy rather than whitish to white-gray; forefeet and  hind feet darker dorsally and ventrally; posterior margin of  basioccipital bowed anteriorly in a broad U-shape with a secondary small  median anteriorly directed U-shaped curve, rather than bowed anteriorly  in a simple U-shape; interparietal more compressed anteroposteriorly;  coronoid process of mandible so acutely recurved that tip of coronoid  points posteroventrally and appears sickle-shaped.    _Remarks._--Blossom and Burt (1942:1) described _B. t. ater_ as the  darkest of the known subspecies. It is dark, but specimens from some  parts of the ranges of _B. t. analogous_, _B. t. fuliginatus_, and _B.  t. subater_ exceed in melanins the darkest individuals of _ater_. Blair  and Blossom (1948:5) also concluded by the use of an Ives tint  photometer that _B. t. subater_ was significantly darker than _B. t.  ater_.    When paratypes of _ater_ and specimens of _B. t. paulus_ are compared,  the darkest individuals of _ater_ exceed but slightly the darkest of  _paulus_. The darkest specimens of _paulus_ occur in southern Zacatecas,  and northern Jalisco, and the palest of the series are in northern  Durango and southern Chihuahua. When paratypes of _ater_ and _paulus_  are compared, the difference in color is readily distinguishable.  Specimens from 1-1/2 mi. N San Francisco, in northern Chihuahua, appear  to be intermediate in color between _ater_ and _paulus_ except for a  faint tinge of buff ventrally. In characters of the crania, these  specimens resemble _ater_ and are referred to that subspecies. A  slightly different pattern of color is present in pygmy mice from the  Peloncillo Mountains and the Animas Valley of New Mexico; the upper  parts resemble those of paratypes of _ater_, but the venter has only the  faintest suggestion of the buffy wash. Crania of these specimens from  New Mexico are inseparable from those of paratypes of _ater_, and the  specimens are, therefore, referred to _ater_.    When specimens are arranged by localities from Arizona east into  southern New Mexico, thence south into Chihuahua and Durango, gradual  intergradation in color is evident from dark in the north to pale browns  in the south, whereas, size and shape of interparietal and size and  shape of coronoid process of the lower jaw divide quite distinctly into  two morphological types in central Chihuahua.    Cranial variation in size and proportion among adults is slight  throughout the range of _ater_ compared to variation detected in other  subspecies of _Baiomys taylori_. Perhaps such a relatively stable  pattern of characters of the crania reflects the homogeneity of the gene  pool, with respect to these characters, of the populations sampled. The  fact that the color of the pelage of this subspecies varies considerable  throughout its known range and that the crania do not is perhaps a clue  to the mode of inheritance of characters in these mice. Seemingly, color  of pelage is inherited independently of characters of the cranium. The  relative lack of variability in the crania of _ater_ may result from  uniform environmental conditions, which have served to select for  uniform characters in the populations. All of the other wide-ranging  subspecies of _B. taylori_ occupy more diverse habitats than _ater_.  Secondly, the rather abrupt change in the cline of measured characters  of the crania between _ater_ and _paulus_ in central Chihuahua suggests  a secondary zone of intergradation. The probable cessation of gene flow  in the past between these two subspecies, allowing _ater_ to be isolated  for a time, may also, in part, account for the relative lack of  variability in the crania of _ater_.    _Specimens examined._--Total 58, distributed as follows: ARIZONA:  _Graham County_: 1-1/2 mi.
