Know ye that the  Bishop of Bayeux my brother for the love of God and for the  salvation of my soul and his own, has given to St. Trinity all  houses with their appurtenances which he has at Sandwich and that  he has given what he has given by my license.\" Many private owners  of churches gave them to cathedrals or monastic communities,  partly to ensure their long-term survival, and partly because of  church pressure.    When the land was all divided out, the barons had about 3/7 of it  and the church about 2/7. Most of the barons had been royal  servants. The king retained about 2/7, including forests for  hunting, for himself and his family and household, on which he  built many royal castles and hundreds of manor [large private  estate headed by a lord] houses throughout the nation. He built  the massive White Tower in London. It was tall with four turrets  on top, and commanded a view of the river and bridge, the city and  the surrounding countryside. The only windows were slits from  which arrows could be shot. On the fourth and top floor was the  council chamber and the gallery of the chapel. On the third floor  was the banqueting hall, the sword room, and the chapel. The king  and his household slept in apartments on these upper floors.  Stairs went up to the gateway entrance on the second floor, which  were hidden by a wall. The garrison's barracks were on the first  floor (ground floor). Any prisoners were kept in cells at a level  below the first floor. The other castles were often built at the  old fortification burhs of Alfred. Each had a constable in charge,  who was a baron. Barons and earls had castle-guard duty in the  king's castles. The Conquerer was constantly moving about the land  among his and his barons' castles, where he met with his magnates  and conducted public business, such as deciding disputes about  holding of land. Near his own castles and other of his property,  he designated many areas as royal hunting forests. Anyone who  killed a deer in these forests was mutilated, for instance by  blinding. People living within the boundaries of the designated  forestland could no longer go into nearby woods to get meat or  honey, dead wood for firing, or live wood for building. Swineherds  could no longer drive pigs into these woods to eat acorns they  beat down from oak trees. Making clearings and grazing livestock  in the designated forestland were prohibited. Most of the nation  was either wooded or bog at this time.    London was a walled town of one and two story houses made of mud,  twigs, and straw, with thatched roofs. It included a bundle of  communities, townships, parishes, and lordships. There were  churches, a goods market, a fish market, quays on the river, and a  bridge over the river. Streets probably named by this time include  Bread Street, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Wood Street, and Ironmonger  Lane. Fairs and games were held outside the town walls in a field  called \"Smithfield\". The great citizens had the land  qualifications of knights and ranked as barons on the Conquerer's  council. The freemen were a small percentage of London's  population. There was a butchers' guild, a pepperers' guild, a  goldsmiths' guild, the guild of St. Lazarus, which was probably a  leper charity (of which there were many in the 1000s and 1100s),  the Pilgrims' guild, which helped people going on pilgrimages, and  four bridge guilds, probably for keeping the wooden London Bridge  in repair. Men told the time by sundials, some of which were  portable and could be carried in one's pocket. London could defend  itself, and a ringing of the bell of St. Paul's Church could shut  every shop and fill the streets with armed horsemen and soldiers  led by a soldier portreeve. Across the Thames from London on its  south side was Southwark, a small trading and fishing settlement.    The Conquerer did not interfere with landholding in London, but  recognized its independence as a borough in this writ: \"William  the King greets William, Bishop of London, and Gosfrith the  portreeve, and all the burgesses [citizens] of London friendly.  Know that I will that you be worthy of all the laws you were  worthy of in the time of King Edward. And I will that every child  shall be his father's heir after his father's day. And I will not  suffer any man to do you wrong. God preserve you.\" The Norman word  \"mayor\" replaced \"portreeve\".    So London was not subjected to the Norman feudal system. It had  neither villeins nor slaves. Whenever Kings asserted authority  over it, the citizens reacted until the king \"granted\" a charter  reaffirming the freedoms of the city and its independence.    Under pressure from the ecclesiastical judges, the Conquerer  replaced the death penalty by that of the mutilation of blinding,  chopping off hands, and castrating offenders. Castration was the  punishment for rape. But these mutilations usually led to a slow  death by gangrene.    The Normans used the Anglo-Saxon concepts of jurisdictional  powers. Thus when the Conquerer confirmed \"customs\" to the abbot  of Ely, these were understood to include the following: 1) sac and  soke - the right to hold a court of private jurisdiction and enjoy  its profits, 2) toll - a payment in towns, markets, and fairs for  goods and chattel bought and sold, 3) team - persons might be  vouched to warranty in the court, the grant of which made a court  capable of hearing suits arising from the transfer of land, 4)  infangenthef - right of trying and executing thieves on one's  land, 4) hamsocne, 5) grithbrice - violation of the grantees'  special peace, for instance that of the sheriff, 6) fightwite -  fine for a general breach of the peace, 7) fyrdwite - fine for  failure to appear in the fyrd.    Every shire, now called \"county\", had at least one burh, or  defensible town. Kings had appointed a royal moneyer in each to  mint silver coins such as pennies for local use. On one side was  the King's head in profile and on the other side was the name of  the moneyer. When a new coinage was issued, all moneyers had to go  to London to get the new dies. The Conquerer's head faced  frontally on his dies, instead of the usual profile used by former  Kings.    The Conquerer held and presided over his council three times a  year, as was the custom, at Easter, Christmas, and Whitsuntide,  which coincided with the great Christian festivals. This was an  advisory council and consisted of the Conquerer's wife and sons,  earls, barons, knights, officers of the King's household,  archbishops, and bishops. It replaced the witen of wise men. It  dealt with fundamental matters of law, state, war, and church. Its  functions were largely ceremonial. Earldoms and knighthoods were  conferred and homages to the king were witnessed. Bishops were  nominated. Attendance at the council, like attendance at courts,  was regarded as a burden rather than a privilege. The Conquerer's  will was the motive force which under lay all the council's  action. When it was administering royal justice, it was called the  Royal Court..    The Justiciar was the head of all legal matters and he or the  Conquerer's wife represented the King at the Royal Court in his  absence from the realm. The chamberlain was a financial officer of  the household; his work was rather that of auditor or accountant.  The Chancellor headed the Chancery and the chapel. Other household  offices were steward, butler, constable, and marshall. The  Treasurer was responsible for the collection and distribution of  revenue and was the keeper of the royal treasure at the palace at  Winchester. He was also an important member of the household and  sat in the Exchequer at Westminster, where he received the  accounts of the sheriffs. The Exchequer was composed of the  justiciar as head, the chancellor, the constable, two  chamberlains, the marshall and other experienced councilors. The  word \"Exchequer\" came from the chequered cloth on the table used  to calculate in Roman numerals the amount due and the amount paid.  The word \"calculate\" derives from the word \"calculi\", meaning  peebles. It was a kind of abacus. The Exchequer received yearly  from the sheriffs of the counties taxes, fines, treasure trove,  goods from wrecks, deodands, and movable property of felons, of  persons executed, of fugitives, and of outlaws due to the Crown.  The Conqueror presided yearly over feasts involving several  thousand guests at Westminster Hall, which was 250 feet by 70 feet  with a high ceiling, the largest hall in England.    The Conquerer's reign was a time of tentative expedients and  simple solutions. He administered by issuing writs with commands  or prohibitions. These were read aloud by the sheriffs in the  county courts and other locations. Administration was by the  personal servants of his royal household, such as the chancellor,  chamberlain, constable, marshalls, steward, and butler. The  language of government changed to Latin. The chancellor was from  the clergy and supervised the writers and clerks, who were  literate, and appended the great seal before witnesses to  documents. He also headed the staff of the royal chapel. The  chamberlain was a financial officer who audited and accounted. The  constable was responsible for supplies for the knights of the  royal household. He also supervised the care of horses, hounds,  hawks, and huntsmen, houndsmen, and foresters. The marshalls came  from less important families than the constable and they preserved  order in the king's hall and recorded expenditures of the  household officers on tallies. The steward was a great baron whose  duties were chiefly ceremonial, such as placing the dishes before  the king at banquets.    Sheriffs became powerful figures as the primary agents for  enforcing royal edicts. There was no longer supervision of them by  earls nor influence on them by bishops."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6615"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Complete (#18)"],[1,"ection. One day, while on a visit to a friend,  the wife saw her husband drive by in a carriage with a showy woman beside  him. She went home at once, and when the supposed recreant returned she  met him with bitter reproaches. He answered never a word, but took his  hat and left the house, never to be seen again in the places that had  known him.    The wife watched and waited, daily looking for his return, but days  lengthened into weeks, months, years, and still he came not. Sometimes  she lamented that she had spoken hastily and harshly, thinking that, had  she known all, she might have found him blameless. There was no family to  look after, no wholesome occupation that she sought, so the days went by  in listening and watching, until, at last, her body and mind gave way,  and the familiar sight of her face, watching from a second floor window,  was seen no longer. Her last day came. She had risen from her bed; life  and mind seemed for a moment to be restored to her; and standing where  she had stood so often, her form supported by a half-closed shutter and a  grasp on the sash, she looked into the street once more, sighed  hopelessly, and so died. It was her shade that long watched at the  windows; it was her waxen face, heavy with fatigue and pain, that was  dimly seen looking over the balusters in the evening.          THE RIVAL FIDDLERS    Before Brooklyn had spread itself beyond Greenwood Cemetery a stone could  be seen in Martense's Lane, south of that burial-ground, that bore a hoof  mark. A negro named Joost, in the service of the Van Der  Something-or-others, was plodding home on Saturday night, his fiddle  under his arm. He had been playing for a wedding in Flatbush and had been  drinking schnapps until he saw stars on the ground and fences in the sky;  in fact, the universe seemed so out of order that he seated himself  rather heavily on this rock to think about it. The behavior of the stars  in swimming and rolling struck him as especially curious, and he  conceived the notion that they wanted to dance. Putting his fiddle to his  chin, he began a wild jig, and though he made it up as he went along, he  was conscious of doing finely, when the boom of a bell sent a shiver down  his spine. It was twelve o'clock, and here he was playing a dance tune on  Sunday. However, the sin of playing for one second on the Sabbath was as  great as that of playing all day; so, as long as he was in for it, he  resolved to carry the tune to the end, and he fiddled away with a  reckless vehemence. Presently he became aware that the music was both  wilder and sweeter than before, and that there was more of it. Not until  then did he observe that a tall, thin stranger stood beside him; and that  he was fiddling too,--composing a second to Joost's air, as if he could  read his thought before he put it into execution on the strings. Joost  paused, and the stranger did likewise.    \"Where de debble did you come frum?\" asked the first. The other smiled.    \"And how did you come to know dat music?\" Joost pursued.    \"Oh, I've known that tune for years,\" was the reply. \"It's called 'The  Devil's joy at Sabbath Breaking.'\"    \"You're a liar!\" cried the negro. The stranger bowed and burst into a  roar of laughter. \"A liar!\" repeated Joost,--\"for I made up dat music dis  very minute.\"    \"Yet you notice that I could follow when you played.\"    \"Humph! Yes, you can follow.\"    \"And I can lead, too. Do you know the tune 'Go to the Devil and Shake  Yourself?'\"    \"Yes; but I play second to nobody.\"    \"Very well, I'll beat you at any air you try.\"    \"Done!\" said Joost. And then began a contest that lasted until daybreak.  The stranger was an expert, but Joost seemed to be inspired, and just as  the sun appeared he sounded, in broad and solemn harmonies, the hymn of  Von Catts:       \"Now behold, at dawn of day,     Pious Dutchmen sing and pray.\"    At that the stranger exclaimed, \"Well, that beats the devil!\" and  striking his foot angrily on the rock, disappeared in a flash of fire  like a burst bomb. Joost was hurled twenty feet by the explosion, and lay  on the ground insensible until a herdsman found him some hours later. As  he suffered no harm from the contest and became a better fiddler than  ever, it is supposed that the recording angel did not inscribe his feat  of Sabbath breaking against him in large letters. There were a few who  doubted his story, but they had nothing more to say when he showed them  the hoof-mark on the rock. Moreover, there are fewer fiddlers among the  negroes than there used to be, because they say that the violin is the  devil's instrument.          WYANDANK    From Brooklyn Heights, or Ihpetonga, \"highplace of trees,\" where the  Canarsie Indians made wampum or sewant, and where they contemplated the  Great Spirit in the setting of the sun across the meeting waters, to  Montauk Point, Long Island has been swept by the wars of red men, and  many are the tokens of their occupancy. A number of their graves were to  be seen until within fifty years, as clearly marked as when the warriors  were laid there in the hope of resurrection among the happy hunting  grounds that lay to the west and south. The casting of stones on the  death-spots or graves of some revered or beloved Indians was long  continued, and was undoubtedly for the purpose of raising monuments to  them, though at Monument Mountain, Massachusetts, Sacrifice Rock, between  Plymouth and Sandwich, Massachusetts, and some other places the cairns  merely mark a trail. Even the temporary resting-place of Sachem  Poggatacut, near Sag Harbor, was kept clear of weeds and leaves by  Indians who passed it in the two centuries that lapsed between the death  of the chief and the laying of the road across it in 1846. This spot is  not far from Whooping Boy's Hollow, so named because of a boy who was  killed by Indians, and because the rubbing of two trees there in a storm  gave forth a noise like crying. An older legend has it that this noise is  the angry voice of the magician who tried to slay Wyandank, the  \"Washington of the Montauks,\" who is buried on the east end of the  island. Often he led his men into battle, sounding the warwhoop, copied  from the scream of the eagle, so loudly that those who heard it said that  the Montauks were crying for prey.    It was while killing an eagle on Block Island, that he might use the  plumes for his hair, that this chief disclosed himself to the hostiles  and brought on a fight in which every participant except himself was  slain. He was secretly followed back to Long Island by a magician who had  hopes of enlisting the evil ones of that region against him,--the giants  that left their tracks in \"Blood-stone Rock\" and \"Printed Rock,\" near  Napeague, and such renegades as he who, having betrayed his people, was  swallowed by the earth, his last agony being marked by a stamp of the  foot that left its print on a slab near the Indian burial-ground at  Kongonok. Failing in these alliances the wizard hid among the hollows of  the moors, and there worked spells of such malice that the chief's hand  lost steadiness in the hunt and his voice was seldom heard in council.  When the haunt of this evil one was made known, a number of young men  undertook to trap him. They went to the hills by night, and moved  stealthily through the shrubbery until they were almost upon him; but his  familiars had warned him of their approach, though they had wakened him  only to betray him for a cloud swept in from the sea, fell about the  wretch, burst into flame, and rolled back toward the ocean, bearing him  in the centre of its burning folds. Because of the cry he uttered the  place long bore the name of Whooping Hollow, and it used to be said that  the magician visited the scene of his ill-doing every winter, when his  shrieks could be heard ringing over the hills.          MARK OF THE SPIRIT HAND    Andover, New Jersey, was quaint and quiet in the days before the  Revolution--it is not a roaring metropolis, even yet--and as it offered  few social advantages there was more gathering in taprooms and more  drinking of flip than there should have been. Among those who were not  averse to a cheering cup were three boon companions, Bailey, Hill, and  Evans, farmers of the neighborhood. They loved the tavern better than the  church, and in truth the church folk did not love them well, for they  were suspected of entertaining heresies of the most forbidden character.  It was while they were discussing matters of belief over their glasses  that one of them proposed, in a spirit of bravado, that whichever of the  trio might be first to die should come back from the grave and reveal  himself to the others--if he could--thus settling the question as to  whether there was a future.    Not long after this agreement--for consent was unanimous--Hill departed  this life. His friends lamented his absence, especially at the tavern,  but they anticipated no attempt on his part to express the distinguished  consideration that he had felt for his old chums. Some weeks passed, yet  there was no sign, and the two survivors of the party, as they jogged  homeward to the house where both lived, had begun to think and speak less  frequently of the absent one. But one night the household was alarmed by  a terrible cry. Bailey got a light and hurried to the bedside of his  friend, whom he found deathly white and holding his chest as if in pain.  \"He has been here!\" gasped Evans. \"He stood here just now.\"    \"Who?\" asked Bailey, a creep passing down his spine.    \"Hill! He stood there, where you are now, and touched me with a hand that  was so cold--cold--\" and Evans shivered violently. On turning back the  collar of his shirt the impression of a hand appeared on the flesh near  the shoulder: a hand in white, with one finger missing. Hill had lost a  finger. There was less of taverns after that night, for Evans carried the  token of that ghostly visit"]]]
