The rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night  settled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except  for the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between  the pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the  men set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was  strong and inviting.    \"Fetch the saddle-blanket an' set with your backs to the fire,\" said  Roy.      Later, when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and  sheltered from the rain, Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen  asleep. The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day. She  could see the smoke, the trunk of the big pine towering aloft, and  a blank space of sky. The stream hummed a song, seemingly musical at  times, and then discordant and dull, now low, now roaring, and always  rushing, gurgling, babbling, flowing, chafing in its hurry.    Presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses,  and beside the fire they conversed in low tones.    \"Wal, thet trail we made to-day will be hid, I reckon,\" said Roy, with  satisfaction.    \"What wasn't sheeped over would be washed out. We've had luck. An' now I  ain't worryin',\" returned Dale.    \"Worryin'? Then it's the first I ever knowed you to do.\"    \"Man, I never had a job like this,\" protested the hunter.    \"Wal, thet's so.\"    \"Now, Roy, when old Al Auchincloss finds out about this deal, as he's  bound to when you or the boys get back to Pine, he's goin' to roar.\"    \"Do you reckon folks will side with him against Beasley?\"    \"Some of them. But Al, like as not, will tell folks to go where it's  hot. He'll bunch his men an' strike for the mountains to find his  nieces.\"    \"Wal, all you've got to do is to keep the girls hid till I can guide him  up to your camp. Or, failin' thet, till you can slip the girls down to  Pine.\"    \"No one but you an' your brothers ever seen my senaca. But it could be  found easy enough.\"    \"Anson might blunder on it. But thet ain't likely.\"    \"Why ain't it?\"    \"Because I'll stick to thet sheep-thief's tracks like a wolf after a  bleedin' deer. An' if he ever gets near your camp I'll ride in ahead of  him.\"    \"Good!\" declared Dale. \"I was calculatin' you'd go down to Pine, sooner  or later.\"    \"Not unless Anson goes. I told John thet in case there was no fight on  the stage to make a bee-line back to Pine. He was to tell Al an' offer  his services along with Joe an' Hal.\"    \"One way or another, then, there's bound to be blood spilled over this.\"    \"Shore! An' high time. I jest hope I get a look down my old 'forty-four'  at thet Beasley.\"    \"In that case I hope you hold straighter than times I've seen you.\"    \"Milt Dale, I'm a good shot,\" declared Roy, stoutly.    \"You're no good on movin' targets.\"    \"Wal, mebbe so. But I'm not lookin' for a movin' target when I meet up  with Beasley. I'm a hossman, not a hunter. You're used to shootin' flies  off deer's horns, jest for practice.\"    \"Roy, can we make my camp by to-morrow night?\" queried Dale, more  seriously.    \"We will, if each of us has to carry one of the girls. But they'll do it  or die. Dale, did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid Bo?\"    \"Me! Where'd I ever see any girls?\" ejaculated Dale. \"I remember some  when I was a boy, but I was only fourteen then. Never had much use for  girls.\"    \"I'd like to have a wife like that Bo,\" declared Roy, fervidly.    There ensued a moment's silence.    \"Roy, you're a Mormon an' you already got a wife,\" was Dale's reply.    \"Now, Milt, have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of  a Mormon with two wives?\" returned Roy, and then he laughed heartily.    \"I never could stomach what I did hear pertainin' to more than one wife  for a man.\"    \"Wal, my friend, you go an' get yourself ONE. An' see then if you  wouldn't like to have TWO.\"    \"I reckon one 'd be more than enough for Milt Dale.\"    \"Milt, old man, let me tell you thet I always envied you your freedom,\"  said Roy, earnestly. \"But it ain't life.\"    \"You mean life is love of a woman?\"    \"No. Thet's only part. I mean a son--a boy thet's like you--thet you  feel will go on with your life after you're gone.\"    \"I've thought of that--thought it all out, watchin' the birds an'  animals mate in the woods.... If I have no son I'll never live  hereafter.\"    \"Wal,\" replied Roy, hesitatingly, \"I don't go in so deep as thet. I mean  a son goes on with your blood an' your work.\"    \"Exactly... An', Roy, I envy you what you ve got, because it's out of  all bounds for Milt Dale.\"    Those words, sad and deep, ended the conversation. Again the rumbling,  rushing stream dominated the forest. An owl hooted dismally. A horse  trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of  teeth on grass.      A voice pierced Helen's deep dreams and, awaking, she found Bo shaking  and calling her.    \"Are you dead?\" came the gay voice.    \"Almost. Oh, my back's broken,\" replied Helen. The desire to move seemed  clamped in a vise, and even if that came she believed the effort would  be impossible.    \"Roy called us,\" said Bo. \"He said hurry. I thought I'd die just sitting  up, and I'd give you a million dollars to lace my boots. Wait, sister,  till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots!\"    With heroic and violent spirit Helen sat up to find that in the act  her aches and pains appeared beyond number. Reaching for her boots,  she found them cold and stiff. Helen unlaced one and, opening it wide,  essayed to get her sore foot down into it. But her foot appeared swollen  and the boot appeared shrunken. She could not get it half on, though  she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms. She  groaned.    Bo laughed wickedly. Her hair was tousled, her eyes dancing, her cheeks  red.    \"Be game!\" she said. \"Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your  boot on.\"    Whether Bo's scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to  Helen, but the fact was that she got into her boots. Walking and  moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired  feeling. The water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than  any ice Helen had ever felt. It almost paralyzed her hands. Bo mumbled,  and blew like a porpoise. They had to run to the fire before being able  to comb their hair. The air was wonderfully keen. The dawn was clear,  bright, with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise.    \"All ready, girls,\" called Roy. \"Reckon you can help yourselves. Milt  ain't comin' in very fast with the hosses. I'll rustle off to help him.  We've got a hard day before us. Yesterday wasn't nowhere to what to-day  'll be.\"    \"But the sun's going to shine?\" implored Bo.    \"Wal, you bet,\" rejoined Roy, as he strode off.    Helen and Bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps  half an hour; then the horses came thudding down, with Dale and Roy  riding bareback.    By the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up, melting the  frost and ice, so that a dazzling, bright mist, full of rainbows, shone  under the trees.    Dale looked Ranger over, and tried the cinches of Bo's horse.    \"What's your choice--a long ride behind the packs with me--or a short  cut over the hills with Roy?\" he asked.    \"I choose the lesser of two rides,\" replied Helen, smiling.    \"Reckon that 'll be easier, but you'll know you've had a ride,\" said  Dale, significantly.    \"What was that we had yesterday?\" asked Bo, archly.    \"Only thirty miles, but cold an' wet. To-day will be fine for ridin'.\"    \"Milt, I'll take a blanket an' some grub in case you don't meet us  to-night,\" said Roy. \"An' I reckon we'll split up here where I'll have  to strike out on thet short cut.\"    Bo mounted without a helping hand, but Helen's limbs were so stiff that  she could not get astride the high Ranger without assistance. The hunter  headed up the slope of the canyon, which on that side was not steep.  It was brown pine forest, with here and there a clump of dark,  silver-pointed evergreens that Roy called spruce. By the time this slope  was surmounted Helen's aches were not so bad. The saddle appeared to  fit her better, and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar. She  reflected, however, that she always had done pretty well uphill. Here it  was beautiful forest-land, uneven and wilder. They rode for a time along  the rim, with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below, with  its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear.    Dale reined in and peered down at the pine-mat.    \"Fresh deer sign all along here,\" he said, pointing.    \"Wal, I seen thet long ago,\" rejoined Roy.    Helen's scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in  the pine-needles, dark in color and sharply defined.    \"We may never get a better chance,\" said Dale. \"Those deer are workin'  up our way. Get your rifle out.\"    Travel was resumed then, with Roy a little in advance of the pack-train.  Presently he dismounted, threw his bridle, and cautiously peered ahead.  Then, turning, he waved his sombrero. The pack-animals halted in a  bunch. Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to Roy's horse.  This point, Helen saw, was at the top of an intersecting canuon. Dale  dismounted, without drawing his rifle from its saddle-sheath, and  approached Roy.    \"Buck an' two does,\" he said, low-voiced. \"An' they've winded us, but  don't see us yet.... Girls, ride up closer.\"    Following the directions indicated by Dale's long arm, Helen looked down  the slope. It was open, with tall pines here and there, and clumps of  silver spruce, and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight.  Presently Bo exclaimed: \"Oh, look! I see! I see!\" Then Helen's roving  glance passed something different from green and gold and brown."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#18)"],[1,"wondered if by any chance  human hands had placed them in his room. The more he thought of it the  stranger it seemed, and he made up his mind to keep watch every night,  in case another golden bar should be sent as a portion for his  youngest daughter.    And so when Nicholas went the third time and dropped the last bar  through the little window, the father came quickly out, and before  Nicholas had time to hide, caught him by his cloak.    \"O Nicholas,\" he cried, \"is it thou who hast helped us in our need?  Why didst thou hide thyself?\" And then he fell on his knees and began  to kiss the hands that had helped him so graciously.    But Nicholas bade him stand up and give thanks to God instead, warning  him to tell no one the story of the golden bars.    This was only one of the many kind acts Nicholas loved to do, and it  was no wonder that he was beloved by all who knew him.    Soon afterwards Nicholas made up his mind to enter God's service as a  priest. He longed above all things to leave the world and live as a  hermit in the desert, but God came to him in a vision and told him he  must stay in the crowded cities and do his work among the people.  Still his desire to see the deserts and the hermits who lived there  was so great that he went off on a journey to Egypt and the Holy Land.  But remembering what God had bade him do he did not stay there but  returned to his own country.    On the way home a terrific storm arose, and it seemed as if the ship  he was in must be lost. The sailors could do nothing, and great waves  dashed over the deck, filling the ship with water. But just as all had  given up hope, Nicholas knelt and prayed to God to save them, and  immediately a calm fell upon the angry sea. The winds sank to rest and  the waves ceased to lash the sides of the ship so that they sailed  smoothly on, and all danger passed.    Thus Nicholas returned home in safety, and went to live in the city of  Myra. His ways were so quiet and humble that no one knew much about  him, until it came to pass one day that the Archbishop of Myra died.  Then all the priests met to choose another archbishop, and it was made  known to them by a sign from heaven that the first man who should  enter the church next morning should be the bishop whom God had  chosen.    Now Nicholas used to spend most of his nights in prayer and always  went very early to church, so next morning just as the sun was rising  and the bells began to ring for the early mass, he was seen coming up  to the church door and was the first to enter. As he knelt down  quietly to say his prayers as usual, what was his surprise to meet a  company of priests who hailed him as their new archbishop, chosen by  God to be their leader and guide. So Nicholas was made Archbishop of  Myra to the joy of all in the city who knew and loved him.    Not long after this there was great trouble in the town of Myra, for  the harvests of that country had failed and a terrible famine swept  over the land. Nicholas, as a good bishop should, felt the suffering  of his people as if it were his own, and did all he could to help  them.    He knew that they must have corn or they would die, so he went to the  harbour where two ships lay filled with grain, and asked the captains  if they would sell him their cargo. They told the bishop they would  willingly do so, but it was already sold to merchants of another  country and they dared not sell it over again.    \"Take no thought of that,\" said Nicholas, \"only sell me some of thy  corn for my starving people, and I promise thee that there shall be  nought wanting when thou shalt arrive at thy journey's end.\"    The captains believed in the bishop's promise and gave him as much  corn as he asked. And behold! when they came to deliver their cargo to  the owners, there was not a bag lacking.    There are many stories told about the good bishop. Like his Master, he  ever went about doing good; and when he died, there were a great many  legends told about him, for the people loved to believe that their  bishop still cared for them and would come to their aid. We do not  know if all these legends are true, but they show how much Saint  Nicholas was loved and honoured even after his death, and how every  one believed in his power to help them.    Here is one of the stories which all children who love Saint Nicholas  will like to hear.    There was once a nobleman who had no children and who longed for a son  above everything else in the world. Night and day he prayed to Saint  Nicholas that he would grant him his request, and at last a son was  born. He was a beautiful child, and the father was so delighted and so  grateful to the saint who had listened to his prayers that, every year  on the child's birthday, he made a great feast in honour of Saint  Nicholas and a grand service was held in the church.    Now the Evil One grew angry each year when this happened, for it made  many people go to church and honour the good saint, neither of which  things pleased the Evil One at all. So each year he tried to think of  some plan that would put an end to these rejoicings, and he decided  at last that if only he could do some evil to the child the parents  would blame Saint Nicholas and all would be well.    It happened just then to be the boy's sixth birthday and a greater  feast than ever was being held. It was late in the afternoon, and the  gardener and porter and all the servants were away keeping holiday,  too. So no one noticed a curious-looking pilgrim who came and sat  close to the great iron gates which led into the courtyard. He had on  the ordinary robe of a poor pilgrim, but the hood was drawn so far  over his face that nothing but a dark shadow could be seen inside. And  indeed that was as well, for this pilgrim was a demon in disguise, and  his wicked, black face would have frightened any one who saw it. He  could not enter the courtyard for the great gates were always kept  locked, and, as you know, the porter was away that day, feasting with  all the other servants.    But, before very long, the little boy grew weary of his birthday  feast, and, having had all he wanted he begged to be allowed to go to  play in the garden. His parents knew that the gardener always looked  after him there, so they told him he might go. They forgot that the  gardener was not there just then.    The child played happily alone for some time and then wandered into  the courtyard, and looking out of the gate saw a poor pilgrim resting  there.    \"What are you doing here?\" asked the child, \"and why do you sit so  still?\"    \"I am a poor pilgrim,\" answered the demon, trying to make his harsh  voice sound as gentle as possible, \"and I have come all the way from  Rome. I am resting here because I am so weary and footsore and have  had nothing to eat all day.\"    \"I will let you in, and take you to my father,\" said the child; \"this  is my birthday, and no one must go hungry to-day.\"    But the demon pretended he was too weak to walk, and begged the boy to  bring some food out to him.    Then the child ran back to the banquet hall in a great hurry and said  to his father:    \"O father, there is a poor pilgrim from Rome sitting outside our gate,  and he is so hungry, may I take him some of my birthday feast?\"    The father was very pleased to think that his little son should care  for the poor and wish to be kind, so he willingly gave his permission  and told one of the servants to give the child all that he wanted.    Then as the demon sat eating the good things he began to question the  boy and tried to find out all that he could about him.    \"Do you often play in the garden?\" he asked.    \"Oh, yes,\" said the child. \"I play there whenever I may, for in the  midst of the lawn there is a beautiful fountain, and the gardener  makes me boats to sail on the water.\"    \"Will he make you one to-day?\" asked the demon quickly.    \"He is not here to-day,\" answered the child, \"for this is a holiday  for every one and I am quite alone.\"    Then the demon rose to his feet slowly and said he felt so much better  after the good food that he thought he could walk a little and would  like very much to come in and see the beautiful garden and the  fountain he had heard about.    So the child climbed up and with great difficulty drew back the bolts.  The great gates swung open and the demon walked in.    As they went along together towards the fountain the child held out  his little hand to lead the pilgrim, but even the demon shrunk from  touching anything so pure and innocent, and folded his arms under his  robe, so that the child could only hold by a fold of his cloak.    \"What strange kind of feet you have,\" said the child as they walked  along; \"they look as if they belonged to an animal.\"    \"Yes, they are curious,\" said the demon, \"but it is just the way they  are made.\"    Then the child began to notice the demon's hands, which were even more  curious than his feet, and just like paws of a bear. But he was too  courteous to say anything about them, when he had already mentioned  the feet.    Just then they came to the fountain, and with a sudden movement the  demon threw back his hood and showed his dreadful face. And before  the child could scream he was seized by those hairy hands and thrown  into the water.    But just at that moment the gardener was returning to his work and saw  from a distance what had happened. He ran as fast as he could, but he  only got to the fountain in time to see the demon vanish, while the  child's body was floating on the water. Very quickly he drew him out,  and carried him, all dripping wet, up to the castle, where they tried  to bring him back to life. But, alas! it all seemed of no use; he  neither moved nor breathed, and the day that had begun with such  rejoicing, ended in the bitterest woe. The poor parents were  heart-broken, but they did not quite lose hope and prayed earnestly to  Saint Nicholas who had given them"]]]
