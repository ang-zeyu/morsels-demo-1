Spongillidae in which the gemmules have (normally) cylindrical or  subcylindrical spicules that are sharp or blunt at the ends, without a  distinct transverse disk or disks and without comb-like vertical rows of  spines.    The skeleton is variable in structure, sometimes being almost amorphous,  sometimes having well-defined radiating and transverse fibres firmly  compacted with spongin. The skeleton-spicules are either sharp or blunt  at the ends. Flesh-spicules are often absent; when present they are  needle-like and resemble the gemmule-spicules in general structure; they  have not even rudimentary rotules at their ends. The gemmules either lie  free in the substance of the sponge or are attached to its support;  sometimes they adhere together in free or attached groups.    _Spongilla_ is undoubtedly the most primitive genus of the Spongillidae,  its spicules showing less sign of specialization than those of any other  genus included in the family. As a fossil it goes back at any rate to  the Upper Jurassic (p. 52).    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--Cosmopolitan. In most countries the majority  of the freshwater sponges belong to this genus, but in Japan _Ephydatia_  seems to predominate.      _Key to the Indian Species of_ Spongilla.      I.

Spongillae in which the gemmules are covered with a thick, apparently  granular pneumatic coat. A delicate membrane often occurs outside this  coat, but it is never thick or horny. The gemmules usually lie free in  the sponge but sometimes adhere to its support; rarely they are fastened  together in groups (_e. g._ in _S. aspinosa_, Potts). The  skeleton-spicules are never very stout and the skeleton is always  delicate.    The species in this subgenus are closely allied and must be  distinguished rather by the sum of their peculiarities than by any one  character. They occur in all countries in which Spongillidae are found.  Seven Indian species may be recognized.      1. Spongilla lacustris, _auctorum_.        _Spongilla lacustris_, Bowerbank, P. Zool. Soc.

[I have not attempted to give a detailed synonymy of this       common species. There is no means of telling whether many of       the earlier names given to forms or allies of _S. lacustris_       are actual synonyms, and it would serve no useful purpose,       so far as the fauna of India is concerned, to complicate       matters by referring to obscure descriptions or possible       descriptions of a species only represented in India, so far       as we know, by a specialized local race, to which separate       references are given.]    _Sponge_ soft and easily compressed, very brittle when dry, usually  consisting of a flat or rounded basal portion of no great depth and of  long free cylindrical branches, which droop when removed from the water;  branches occasionally absent. Colour bright green when the sponge is  growing in a strong light, dirty flesh-colour when it is growing in the  shade. (Even in the latter case traces of the \"green corpuscles\" can be  detected in the cells of the parenchyma.) Oscula star-shaped, of  moderate size, as a rule rendered conspicuous by the furrows that  radiate from them over the outer surface of the parenchyma below the  external membrane; oscular collars well developed.    _Skeleton_ reticulate, loose, with definite radiating and transverse  fibres held together by a small quantity of spongin; the fibres slender  but not extremely so.    _Spicules._ Skeleton-spicules smooth, sharply pointed, long, slender.  Flesh-spicules slender, covered with small spines, sharply pointed,  nearly straight. Gemmule-spicules resembling the flesh-spicules but  shorter and as a rule more strongly curved, sometimes bent so as to form  semicircular figures, usually pointed somewhat abruptly; their spines  relatively longer than those of the flesh-spicules, often curved  backwards, especially near the ends of the spicules, at which points  they are often longer than elsewhere.    _Gemmules_ usually numerous in autumn, lying free in the sponge,  spherical, variable in size but usually rather large, as a rule covered  with a thick granular coat in which the spicules are arranged  tangentially; a horizontal layer of spicules often present in the  external membrane; the granular coat and its spicules occasionally  deficient. No foraminal tubule; its place sometimes taken by an open,  bowl-shaped chitinous structure the base of which is in continuity with  the inner chitinous coat of the gemmule.    _S. lacustris_ is an extremely variable species, varying in the size,  proportions and shape of its spicules, in its external form and in the  size and structure of the gemmule. A considerable number of varieties  have been described from different parts of Europe and N. America, but  some of these may represent distinct but closely-allied species;  descriptions of most of them will be found in Potts's \"Fresh-Water  Sponges.\" The embryology and the earlier stages of the development from  the egg have been described in great detail by Evans (Quart. J. Micr.  Sci. (n. s.) xlii, p. 363 (1899)), while the anatomy and physiology are  discussed by most authors who have written on these features in the  Spongillidae.    TYPE.--It is impossible to say who was the first authority to use the  name _Spongilla lacustris_ in the sense in which it is used by recent  authors. No type can therefore be recognized.

Mrs. Hazleton was in the still-room, then, when her dear friend, who had  already on one occasion given the death blow to her schemes upon Mr.  Marlow's heart, drove up to the door and asked to see her.    The servant replied that his mistress was busy in the still-room, but that  he would go and call her in a moment.    \"Oh, dear, no,\" replied the lady, entering the house with an elastic step;  \"I will go and join her there, and surprise her in her charitable works. I  know the way quite well--you needn't come--you needn't come;\" and on she  went to the still-room, which she entered without ceremony.    Mrs. Hazleton was, at that moment, in the act of pouring a purpleish sort  of fluid, out of a glass dish with a lip to it, into an apothecary's vial.  She turned round sharply at the sound of the opening door, thinking that it  was produced by a servant intruding upon her uncalled. When she saw her  friend, however, whose indiscreet advice she had neither forgotten nor  forgiven, her face for a moment turned burning red, and then as pale as  death; and she had nearly let the glass fall from her hand.    What was said on either part matters very little. Mrs. Hazleton was too  wise to speak as sharply as she felt, and led the way from the still-room  as fast as possible; but her dear friend had in one momentary glance seen  every thing--the glass bowl, the vial, the fluid, and--more particularly  than all--Mrs. Hazleton's sudden changes of complexion on her entrance.      CHAPTER XLIV.    Sir Philip Hastings sat at breakfast with his daughter the morning of the  same day on which Mrs. Hazleton in the still-room was subjected to her dear  friend's unpleasant intrusion. He was calmer than he had been since his  return; but it was a gloomy, thoughtful sort of calmness--that sort of  superficial tranquility which is sometimes displayed under the influence of  overpowering feelings, as the sea, so sailors tell us, is sometimes  actually beaten down by the force of the winds that sweep over it. His brow  was contracted with a deep frown, but it was by no means varied. It was  stern, fixed, immoveable. To his daughter he spoke not a word, except when  she bade him good morning, and asked after his health; and then he only  replied \"Well.\"    When breakfast was nearly over, a servant brought in some letters, and  handed two to his master and one to Emily. Sir Philip's were soon read; but  Emily's was longer, and she was still perusing it, with apparently much  emotion, when the servant returned to the room. Sir Philip, during the half  hour they had been previously together, had abstained from turning his eyes  towards her. He had looked at the table cloth, or straight at the wall; but  now he was gazing at her so intently, with a strange, eager, haggard  expression of countenance that he did not even notice the entrance of the  servant till the man spoke to him.    \"Please your worship\" said the servant \"Master Atkinson of the Hill farm,  near Hartwell, wishes to speak to you on some justice business.\"    Sir Philip started, and murmured between his teeth \"Justice--ay,  justice!--who did you say?\"    The man repeated what he had said before, and his master replied, \"shew him  in.\"    He then remained for a moment or two with his head leaning on his hand, and  seemingly making an effort to recall his thoughts from some distant point;  and when Mr. Atkinson entered, he spoke to him tranquilly enough.    \"Pray be seated, Mr. Atkinson,\" he said, \"what is it you want? I have  meddled little with magisterial affairs lately.\"    \"I want a warrant, sir,\" replied Mr. Atkinson. \"And against a near neighbor  and relation of yours; so I am sure you are not a man to refuse me  justice.\"    \"Not if it were my nearest and my dearest,\" replied Sir Philip, in a deep  and hollow tone. \"Who is the person?\"    \"A young man calling himself Sir John Hastings,\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"We are  afraid of his getting out of the country. He knows he has been found out,  and he is hiding somewhere not very far off; but I and a constable will  find him.\"    Emily had lain down her letter by her side, and was listening attentively.  It was clear she was greatly moved by what she heard. Her face turned white  and red. Her lip quivered as if she would fain have spoken; but she  hesitated and remained silent for a moment. She thought of the unhappy  young man lying on his death bed; for she had as yet received no intimation  of his death from Mr. Dixwell, and of his seeing himself seized upon by the  officers of justice, his last thoughts disturbed, all his anxious strivings  after penitence, all his communings with his own heart, all his efforts to  prepare for meeting with death, and God, and judgment, scattered by worldly  shame and earthly anguish--she felt for him--she would fain have petitioned  for him; but she was misunderstood, and, what was worse, she knew it--she  felt it--she could not speak--she dare not say any thing, though her heart  seemed as if it would break, and her only consolation was that all would be  explained, that her motives, her conduct, would all be clear and  comprehended in a very few short hours. She knew, however, that she could  not bear much more without weeping; for the letter which she had received  from Marlow, telling her that he had arrived in London, and would set off  to see her, as soon as some needful business, in the capital had been  transacted, had agitated her much, and even pleasureable emotions will  often shake the unnervous so as to weaken rather than strengthen us when  called upon to contend with others of a different kind.    She rose then and left the room with a sad look and wavering step, and Sir  Philip gazed at her as she passed with a look impossible to describe,  saying to himself, \"So--is it so?\"    The next instant, however, he turned to the farmer, who was a man of a  superior class to the ordinary yeomen of that day, saying, \"What is your  charge, sir?\"    \"Oh, plenty of charges, sir,\" replied the man; \"fraud, conspiracy, perjury,  forgery, in regard to all which I am ready to give information on my oath.\"    Sir Philip leaned his head upon his hand, and thought bitterly for two or  three minutes. Then raising his eyes full to Atkinson's face, he said,  \"Were this young man my own child, were he my son, or were he my brother,  were he a very dear friend, I should not have the slightest hesitation, Mr.  Atkinson. I would take the information, and grant you a warrant at  once--nay, I will do so still, if you insist upon it; for it shall never be  said that any consideration made me refuse justice. But I would have you  remember that Sir John Hastings is my enemy; that he has, justly or  unjustly, deprived me of fortune and station, and throughout the only  transactions we have had together, has shown a spirit of malignity against  me which might well make men believe that I must entertain similar feelings  towards him. To sign a warrant against him, therefore, would be very  painful to me, although I believe him to be capable of the crimes with  which you charge him, and know you to be too honest a man to make such an  accusation without a reasonable confidence in its truth. But I would have  you consider whether it may not bring suspicion upon all your proceedings,  if your very first step therein is to obtain a warrant against this man  from his known and open enemy.\"    \"But what am I to do. Sir Philip?\" asked the farmer. \"I am afraid he will  escape. I know that he is hiding in this very neighborhood, in this very  parish, within half a mile of this house.\"    A groan burst from the heart of Sir Philip Hastings. He had spoken his  remonstrance clearly, slowly, and deliberately, forcibly bending his  thoughts altogether to the subject before him; but he had been deeply and  terribly moved all the time, and this direct allusion to the hiding place  of John Ayliffe, to the very house which his daughter had visited on the  previous day, roused all the terrible feelings, the jealous anger, the  indignation, the horror, the contempt which had been stirred up in him, by  what he thought her indecent, if not criminal act. It was too much for his  self-command, and that groan burst forth in the struggle against himself.    He recovered himself speedily, however, and he replied, \"Apply to Mr.  Dixwell: he is a magistrate, and lives hardly a stone's throw from this  house. You will lose but little time, save me from great pain, and both you  and me from unjust imputations.\"    \"Oh, I am not afraid of any imputations,\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"I have  personally no interest in the matter. You have, Sir, a great interest in  it, and if you would just hear what the case is, you would see that no one  should look more sharply than you to the matter, in order that no time may  be lost.\"    \"I would rather not hear the case at all,\" replied Sir Philip, \"If I have a  personal interest in it, as you say, it would ill befit me to meddle. Go to  Mr. Dixwell, my good friend. Explain the whole to him, and although  perhaps he is not the brightest man that ever lived, yet he is a good man,  and an honest man, who will do justice in this matter.\"    \"Very well, sir, very well,\" replied the farmer, a little mortified; for to  say the truth, he had anticipated some little accession of importance from  lending a helping hand to restore Sir Philip Hastings to the rights of  which he had been unjustly deprived, and taking his leave he went away,  thinking the worthy baronet the most impracticable man he had ever met with  in his life. \"I always knew that he was crotchety,\" he said to himself,  \"and carried his notions of right and wrong to a desperate great length;  but I did not know that he went so far as this. I don't believe that if he  saw a man running away with his own apples, he would stop him without a  warrant from another justice. Yet he can be severe enough when he"]]]
