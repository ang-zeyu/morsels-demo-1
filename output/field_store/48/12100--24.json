By the act of transgression, our first parents acquired a  knowledge, which in their condition of pristine innocence they had not  possessed,--the experimental knowledge of good and evil. The result of  the Fall could have been of none but ill effect had the fallen ones  been immediately restored to a condition of immortality, without  repentance, without atonement. In the despair that followed their  realization of the great change that had come upon them, and in the  light of the knowledge gained at such cost as to the virtues of the  fruit that grew on the Tree of Life, it would have been but natural  for them to seek the seeming advantages of an immediate escape, by  partaking of the celestial food. It was in mercy that they were  deprived of the means of so doing.    =25.= The words of the Creator are unmistakable as to the necessity of  banishing His first earthly children from Eden:--\"And the Lord God  said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil:  and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of  life, and eat, and live forever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth  from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of  Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the  way of the tree of life.\"[184]      [184] Gen. iii, 22-24; Pearl of Great Price: Moses iv, 31.    =26.= Alma, the Nephite prophet, comprehended the result that would  have followed had Adam and his wife eaten of the Tree of Life; he thus  explained the matter:--\"Now we see that the man had become as God,  knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take  also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God  placed Cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of  the fruit; And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to  repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God. For  behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partook of the  tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of  God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God  would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been  frustrated.\"[185]      [185] Alma xlii, 3-5.    =27. The Immediate Result of the Fall= was the substitution of  mortality, with all its attendant frailties, for the vigor of the  primeval deathless state. Adam felt directly the effects of  transgression, in finding a barren and dreary earth, with a sterile  soil, instead of the beauty and fruitfulness of Eden. In place of  pleasing and useful plants, thorns and thistles sprang up; and he had  to labor arduously under the conditions of physical fatigue and  suffering, to cultivate the soil that he might obtain necessary food.  Upon Eve fell the penalty of bodily infirmity; the pains and sorrows,  which since have been regarded as the natural lot of womankind, came  upon her, and she was made subject to her husband. Having now lost  their sense of former innocence, they became ashamed of their  nakedness, and the Lord made for them garments of skins. And upon both  the man and the woman was visited the penalty of spiritual death; for  in that very day they were banished from Eden, and cast out from the  presence of the Lord. The serpent, having served the purposes of  Satan, was made a subject of Divine displeasure, being doomed to crawl  forever in the dust, and to suffer from the enmity which it was  decreed should be placed in the hearts of Eve's children.[186]      [186] See Note 4.    =28. Atonement was Provided for.=--God left not His now mortal  children without hope. He gave other commandments to Adam, requiring  him to offer sacrifices in the name of the Only Begotten Son, and  promising redemption unto him and all his descendants who would comply  with the conditions prescribed. The opportunity of winning the  victor's reward by overcoming evil was explained to our parents, and  they rejoiced. Adam said, \"Blessed be the name of God, for because of  my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have  joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.\" Eve was glad and  declared, \"Were it not for our transgression we never should have had  seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our  redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the  obedient.\"[187]      [187] Pearl of Great Price: Moses v 10-11; see Note 6.    =29. The Fall came not by Chance.=--It would be unreasonable to  suppose that the transgression of Eve and Adam came as a surprise to  the Creator. By His infinite fore-knowledge, God knew what would be  the result of Satan's temptation to Eve, and what Adam would do under  the conditions. And further, it is evident that the Fall was foreseen,  to be a means whereby man could be brought face to face with both good  and evil; that of his own agency he might elect the one or the other,  and thus be prepared by the experiences of a mortal probation for the  exaltation provided in the glorious plan of his creation:--\"For  behold, this is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality  and eternal life of man;\"[188] thus spake the Lord unto Moses. It was  the purpose of God to place within the reach of the spirits begotten  by Him in the heavens the means of individual effort, and the  opportunity of winning, not merely redemption from death but also  salvation and even exaltation, with the powers of eternal progression  and increase. Hence, it was necessary that the spiritual offspring of  God should leave the mansions of their primeval childhood, and enter  the school of mortal experience, meeting, contending with, and  overcoming evil, according to their several degrees of faith and  strength. Adam and Eve could never have been the parents of a mortal  posterity had they not themselves become mortal; mortality, as before  stated, was an essential element in the Divine plan respecting the  earth and its appointed inhabitants; and as a means of introducing  mortality the Lord placed before the progenitors of the race a law,  knowing full well that transgression would follow.      [188] Pearl of Great Price: Moses i 39; see Note 7.    =30.= Eve was fulfilling the foreseen purposes of God by the part she  took in the great drama of the Fall; yet she did not partake of the  forbidden fruit with that object in view, but with the intent to  violate the Divine command, being deceived by the sophistries of the  serpent-fiend. Satan also, for that matter, furthered the purposes of  the Creator, in tempting Eve; yet his design was to thwart the Lord's  plan. We are definitely told that \"he knew not the mind of God,  wherefore he sought to destroy the world.\"[189] Yet, his diabolical  effort, far from being the initiatory step toward destruction,  contributed to the plan of man's eternal exaltation. Adam's part in  the great event was essentially different from that of his wife; he  was not deceived; on the contrary he deliberately decided to do as Eve  desired, that he might carry out the purposes of his Maker with  respect to the race of men, whose first patriarch he was ordained to  be.      [189] Pearl of Great Price: Moses iv, 6.    =31.= Even the transgressions of man may be turned to the  accomplishment of high purposes. As will be shown, the sacrifice of  Christ was ordained from before the foundation of the world,[190] yet  Judas who betrayed, and the blood-thirsty Jews who brought about the  crucifixion of the Son of God, are none the less guilty of the awful  crime.      [190] See Lecture iv, p. 76.    =32.= It has become a common practice with mankind to heap reproaches  upon the progenitors of the family, and to picture the supposedly  blessed state in which we would be living but for the Fall; whereas  our first parents are entitled to our deepest gratitude for their  legacy to posterity,--the means of winning glory, exaltation, and  eternal lives, on the battlefield of mortality. But for the  opportunity thus given, the spirits of God's offspring would have  remained forever in a state of innocent childhood; sinless through no  effort of their own; negatively saved, not from sin, but from the  opportunity of meeting sin; incapable of winning the honors of victory  because prevented from taking part in the battle. As it is, they are  heirs to the birthright of Adam's descendants,--mortality, with its  immeasurable possibilities and its God-given freedom of action. From  Father Adam we have inherited all the ills to which flesh is heir; but  such are necessarily incident to the knowledge of good and evil, by  the proper use of which knowledge man may become even as the  Gods.[191]      [191] See Note 5.      NOTES.         =1. Man's Agency is God-given.=--The following is an extract from       a discourse delivered by President Brigham Young, July 5, 1855.       (See Journal of Discourses of that date, and Millennial Star,       vol. xx, p. 43.) \"What is the foundation of the rights of man?       The Lord Almighty has organized man for the express purpose of       becoming an independent being like unto Himself, and has given       him his individual agency. Man is made in the likeness of his       Creator, the great archetype of the human species, who bestowed       upon him the principles of eternity, planting immortality within       him, and leaving him at liberty to act in the way that seemeth       good unto him;--to choose or refuse for himself, to be a       Latter-day Saint or a Wesleyan Methodist, to belong to the Church       of England, the oldest daughter of the Mother Church, to the old       Mother herself, to her sister the Greek Church, or to be an       infidel and belong to no church.

'Conan!' he ejaculated. 'It is the king, or his ghost! What devil's work  is this?'    'Devil's work to match devils!' mocked Conan, his lips laughing but hell  flaming in his eyes. 'Come, fall to, my gentlemen. You have your swords,  and I this cleaver. Nay, I think this butcher's tool fits the work at  hand, my fair lords!'    'At him!' muttered the Aquilonian, drawing his sword. 'It is Conan and  we must kill or be killed!'    And like men waking from a trance, the Nemedians drew their blades and  rushed on the king.    The headsman's ax was not made for such work, but the king wielded the  heavy, clumsy weapon as lightly as a hatchet, and his quickness of foot,  as he constantly shifted his position, defeated their purpose of  engaging him all three at once.    He caught the sword of the first man on his ax-head and crushed in the  wielder's breast with a murderous counterstroke before he could step  back or parry. The remaining Nemedian, missing a savage swipe, had his  brains dashed out before he could recover his balance, and an instant  later the Aquilonian was backed into a corner, desperately parrying the  crashing strokes that rained about him, lacking opportunity even to  scream for help.    Suddenly Conan's long left arm shot out and ripped the mask from the  man's head, disclosing the pallid features.    'Dog!' grated the king. 'I thought I knew you. Traitor! Damned renegade!  Even this base steel is too honorable for your foul head. Nay, die as  thieves die!'    The ax fell in a devastating arch, and the Aquilonian cried out and went  to his knees, grasping the severed stump of his right arm from which  blood spouted. It had been shorn away at the elbow, and the ax,  unchecked in its descent, had gashed deeply into his side, so that his  entrails bulged out.    'Lie there and bleed to death,' grunted Conan, casting the ax away  disgustedly. 'Come, Countess!'    Stooping, he slashed the cords that bound her wrists and lifting her as  if she had been a child, strode from the dungeon. She was sobbing  hysterically, with her arms thrown about his corded neck in a frenzied  embrace.    'Easy all,' he muttered. 'We're not out of this yet. If we can reach  the dungeon where the secret door opens on stairs that lead to the  tunnel--devil take it, they've heard that noise, even through these  walls.'    Down the corridor arms clanged and the tramp and shouting of men echoed  under the vaulted roof. A bent figure came hobbling swiftly along,  lantern held high, and its light shone full on Conan and the girl. With  a curse the Cimmerian sprang toward him, but the old watchman,  abandoning both lantern and pike, scuttled away down the corridor,  screeching for help at the top of his cracked voice. Deeper shouts  answered him.    Conan turned swiftly and ran the other way. He was cut off from the  dungeon with the secret lock and the hidden door through which he had  entered the Tower, and by which he had hoped to leave, but he knew this  grim building well. Before he was king he had been imprisoned in it.    He turned off into a side passage and quickly emerged into another,  broader corridor, which ran parallel to the one down which he had come,  and which was at the moment deserted. He followed this only a few yards,  when he again turned back, down another side passage. This brought him  back into the corridor he had left, but at a strategic point. A few feet  farther up the corridor there was a heavy bolted door, and before it  stood a bearded Nemedian in corselet and helmet, his back to Conan as he  peered up the corridor in the direction of the growing tumult and wildly  waving lanterns.    Conan did not hesitate. Slipping the girl to the ground, he ran at the  guard swiftly and silently, sword in hand. The man turned just as the  king reached him, bawled in surprise and fright and lifted his pike; but  before he could bring the clumsy weapon into play, Conan brought down  his sword on the fellow's helmet with a force that would have felled an  ox. Helmet and skull gave way together and the guard crumpled to the  floor.    In an instant Conan had drawn the massive bolt that barred the door--too  heavy for one ordinary man to have manipulated--and called hastily to  Albiona, who ran staggering to him. Catching her up unceremoniously with  one arm, he bore her through the door and into the outer darkness.    They had come into a narrow alley, black as pitch, walled by the side of  the Tower on one hand, and the sheer stone back of a row of buildings on  the other. Conan, hurrying through the darkness as swiftly as he dared,  felt the latter wall for doors or windows, but found none.    The great door clanged open behind them, and men poured out, with  torches gleaming on breast-plates and naked swords. They glared about,  bellowing, unable to penetrate the darkness which their torches served  to illuminate for only a few feet in any direction, and then rushed  down the alley at random--heading in the direction opposite to that  taken by Conan and Albiona.    'They'll learn their mistake quick enough,' he muttered, increasing his  pace. 'If we ever find a crack in this infernal wall--damn! The street  watch!'    Ahead of them a faint glow became apparent, where the alley opened into  a narrow street, and he saw dim figures looming against it with a  glimmer of steel. It was indeed the street watch, investigating the  noise they had heard echoing down the alley.    'Who goes there?' they shouted, and Conan grit his teeth at the hated  Nemedian accent.    'Keep behind me,' he ordered the girl. 'We've got to cut our way through  before the prison guards come back and pin us between them.'    And grasping his sword, he ran straight at the oncoming figures. The  advantage of surprise was his. He could see them, limned against the  distant glow, and they could not see him coming at them out of the black  depths of the alley. He was among them before they knew it, smiting with  the silent fury of a wounded lion.    His one chance lay in hacking through before they could gather their  wits. But there were half a score of them, in full mail, hard-bitten  veterans of the border wars, in whom the instinct for battle could take  the place of bemused wits. Three of them were down before they realized  that it was only one man who was attacking them, but even so their  reaction was instantaneous. The clangor of steel rose deafeningly, and  sparks flew as Conan's sword crashed on basinet and hauberk. He could  see better than they, and in the dim light his swiftly moving figure was  an uncertain mark. Flailing swords cut empty air or glanced from his  blade, and when he struck it was with the fury and certainty of a  hurricane.    But behind him sounded the shouts of the prison guards, returning up the  alley at a run, and still the mailed figures before him barred his way  with a bristling wall of steel. In an instant the guards would be on his  back--in desperation he redoubled his strokes, flailing like a smith on  an anvil, and then was suddenly aware of a diversion. Out of nowhere  behind the watchmen rose a score of black figures and there was a sound  of blows, murderously driven. Steel glinted in the gloom, and men cried  out, struck mortally from behind. In an instant the alley was littered  with writhing forms. A dark, cloaked shape sprang toward Conan, who  heaved up his sword, catching a gleam of steel in the right hand. But  the other was extended to him empty and a voice hissed urgently: 'This  way, your Majesty! Quickly!'    With a muttered oath of surprise, Conan caught up Albiona in one  massive arm, and followed his unknown befriender. He was not inclined to  hesitate, with thirty prison guardsmen closing in behind him.    Surrounded by mysterious figures he hurried down the alley, carrying the  countess as if she had been a child. He could tell nothing of his  rescuers except that they wore dark cloaks and hoods. Doubt and  suspicion crossed his mind, but at least they had struck down his  enemies, and he saw no better course than to follow them.    As if sensing his doubt, the leader touched his arm lightly and said:  'Fear not, King Conan; we are your loyal subjects.' The voice was not  familiar, but the accent was Aquilonian of the central provinces.    Behind them the guards were yelling as they stumbled over the shambles  in the mud, and they came pelting vengefully down the alley, seeing the  vague dark mass moving between them and the light of the distant street.  But the hooded men turned suddenly toward the seemingly blank wall, and  Conan saw a door gape there. He muttered a curse. He had traversed that  alley by day, in times past, and had never noticed a door there. But  through it they went, and the door closed behind them with the click of  a lock. The sound was not reassuring, but his guides were hurrying him  on, moving with the precision of familiarity, guiding Conan with a hand  at either elbow. It was like traversing a tunnel, and Conan felt  Albiona's lithe limbs trembling in his arms. Then somewhere ahead of  them an opening was faintly visible, merely a somewhat less black arch  in the blackness, and through this they filed.    After that there was a bewildering succession of dim courts and shadowy  alleys and winding corridors, all traversed in utter silence, until at  last they emerged into a broad lighted chamber, the location of which  Conan could not even guess, for their devious route had confused even  his primitive sense of direction.          10    A Coin from Acheron      Not all his guides entered the chamber. When the door closed, Conan saw  only one man standing before him--a slim figure, masked in a black cloak  with a hood. This the man threw back, disclosing a pale oval of a face,  with calm, delicately chiseled features.    The king set Albiona"]]]
