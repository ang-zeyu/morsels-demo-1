A taxonomic study of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#18)"],[1,"dim rugged glens of the mount [1626], when  he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible  vapour and melted as tin melts when heated by men's art in channelled  [1627] crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is  softened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth  through the strength of Hephaestus [1628]. Even so, then, the earth  melted in the glow of the blazing fire. And in the bitterness of his  anger Zeus cast him into wide Tartarus.    (ll. 869-880) And from Typhoeus come boisterous winds which blow damply,  except Notus and Boreas and clear Zephyr. These are a god-sent kind,  and a great blessing to men; but the others blow fitfully upon the seas.  Some rush upon the misty sea and work great havoc among men with their  evil, raging blasts; for varying with the season they blow, scattering  ships and destroying sailors. And men who meet these upon the sea have  no help against the mischief. Others again over the boundless, flowering  earth spoil the fair fields of men who dwell below, filling them with  dust and cruel uproar.    (ll. 881-885) But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and  settled by force their struggle for honours with the Titans, they  pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by  Earth's prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.    (ll. 886-900) Now Zeus, king of the gods, made Metis his wife first,  and she was wisest among gods and mortal men. But when she was about to  bring forth the goddess bright-eyed Athene, Zeus craftily deceived her  with cunning words and put her in his own belly, as Earth and starry  Heaven advised. For they advised him so, to the end that no other should  hold royal sway over the eternal gods in place of Zeus; for very wise  children were destined to be born of her, first the maiden bright-eyed  Tritogeneia, equal to her father in strength and in wise understanding;  but afterwards she was to bear a son of overbearing spirit, king of gods  and men. But Zeus put her into his own belly first, that the goddess  might devise for him both good and evil.    (ll. 901-906) Next he married bright Themis who bare the Horae (Hours),  and Eunomia (Order), Dike (Justice), and blooming Eirene (Peace), who  mind the works of mortal men, and the Moerae (Fates) to whom wise Zeus  gave the greatest honour, Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos who give  mortal men evil and good to have.    (ll. 907-911) And Eurynome, the daughter of Ocean, beautiful in form,  bare him three fair-cheeked Charites (Graces), Aglaea, and Euphrosyne,  and lovely Thaleia, from whose eyes as they glanced flowed love that  unnerves the limbs: and beautiful is their glance beneath their brows.    (ll. 912-914) Also he came to the bed of all-nourishing Demeter, and she  bare white-armed Persephone whom Aidoneus carried off from her mother;  but wise Zeus gave her to him.    (ll. 915-917) And again, he loved Mnemosyne with the beautiful hair: and  of her the nine gold-crowned Muses were born who delight in feasts and  the pleasures of song.    (ll. 918-920) And Leto was joined in love with Zeus who holds the aegis,  and bare Apollo and Artemis delighting in arrows, children lovely above  all the sons of Heaven.    (ll. 921-923) Lastly, he made Hera his blooming wife: and she was joined  in love with the king of gods and men, and brought forth Hebe and Ares  and Eileithyia.    (ll. 924-929) But Zeus himself gave birth from his own head to  bright-eyed Tritogeneia [1629], the awful, the strife-stirring, the  host-leader, the unwearying, the queen, who delights in tumults and wars  and battles. But Hera without union with Zeus--for she was very angry  and quarrelled with her mate--bare famous Hephaestus, who is skilled in  crafts more than all the sons of Heaven.    (ll. 929a-929t) [1630] But Hera was very angry and quarrelled with her  mate. And because of this strife she bare without union with Zeus who  holds the aegis a glorious son, Hephaestus, who excelled all the sons of  Heaven in crafts. But Zeus lay with the fair-cheeked daughter of Ocean  and Tethys apart from Hera.... ((LACUNA)) ....deceiving Metis (Thought)  although she was full wise. But he seized her with his hands and put  her in his belly, for fear that she might bring forth something stronger  than his thunderbolt: therefore did Zeus, who sits on high and dwells  in the aether, swallow her down suddenly. But she straightway conceived  Pallas Athene: and the father of men and gods gave her birth by way  of his head on the banks of the river Trito. And she remained hidden  beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of  righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men. There the goddess  (Athena) received that [1631] whereby she excelled in strength all  the deathless ones who dwell in Olympus, she who made the host-scaring  weapon of Athena. And with it (Zeus) gave her birth, arrayed in arms of  war.    (ll. 930-933) And of Amphitrite and the loud-roaring Earth-Shaker was  born great, wide-ruling Triton, and he owns the depths of the sea,  living with his dear mother and the lord his father in their golden  house, an awful god.    (ll. 933-937) Also Cytherea bare to Ares the shield-piercer Panic and  Fear, terrible gods who drive in disorder the close ranks of men in  numbing war, with the help of Ares, sacker of towns: and Harmonia whom  high-spirited Cadmus made his wife.    (ll. 938-939) And Maia, the daughter of Atlas, bare to Zeus glorious  Hermes, the herald of the deathless gods, for she went up into his holy  bed.    (ll. 940-942) And Semele, daughter of Cadmus was joined with him in  love and bare him a splendid son, joyous Dionysus,--a mortal woman an  immortal son. And now they both are gods.    (ll. 943-944) And Alcmena was joined in love with Zeus who drives the  clouds and bare mighty Heracles.    (ll. 945-946) And Hephaestus, the famous Lame One, made Aglaea, youngest  of the Graces, his buxom wife.    (ll. 947-949) And golden-haired Dionysus made brown-haired Ariadne,  the daughter of Minos, his buxom wife: and the son of Cronos made her  deathless and unageing for him.    (ll. 950-955) And mighty Heracles, the valiant son of neat-ankled  Alcmena, when he had finished his grievous toils, made Hebe the child of  great Zeus and gold-shod Hera his shy wife in snowy Olympus. Happy he!  For he has finished his great works and lives amongst the undying gods,  untroubled and unageing all his days.    (ll. 956-962) And Perseis, the daughter of Ocean, bare to unwearying  Helios Circe and Aeetes the king. And Aeetes, the son of Helios who  shows light to men, took to wife fair-cheeked Idyia, daughter of Ocean  the perfect stream, by the will of the gods: and she was subject to him  in love through golden Aphrodite and bare him neat-ankled Medea.    (ll. 963-968) And now farewell, you dwellers on Olympus and you islands  and continents and thou briny sea within. Now sing the company of  goddesses, sweet-voiced Muses of Olympus, daughter of Zeus who holds  the aegis,--even those deathless one who lay with mortal men and bare  children like unto gods.    (ll. 969-974) Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the  hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Crete, and  bare Plutus, a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's  wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes  rich, bestowing great wealth upon him.    (ll. 975-978) And Harmonia, the daughter of golden Aphrodite, bare  to Cadmus Ino and Semele and fair-cheeked Agave and Autonoe whom long  haired Aristaeus wedded, and Polydorus also in rich-crowned Thebe.    (ll. 979-983) And the daughter of Ocean, Callirrhoe was joined in the  love of rich Aphrodite with stout hearted Chrysaor and bare a son who  was the strongest of all men, Geryones, whom mighty Heracles killed in  sea-girt Erythea for the sake of his shambling oxen.    (ll. 984-991) And Eos bare to Tithonus brazen-crested Memnon, king  of the Ethiopians, and the Lord Emathion. And to Cephalus she bare a  splendid son, strong Phaethon, a man like the gods, whom, when he was a  young boy in the tender flower of glorious youth with childish thoughts,  laughter-loving Aphrodite seized and caught up and made a keeper of her  shrine by night, a divine spirit.    (ll. 993-1002) And the son of Aeson by the will of the gods led away  from Aeetes the daughter of Aeetes the heaven-nurtured king, when he had  finished the many grievous labours which the great king, over bearing  Pelias, that outrageous and presumptuous doer of violence, put upon him.  But when the son of Aeson had finished them, he came to Iolcus after  long toil bringing the coy-eyed girl with him on his swift ship, and  made her his buxom wife. And she was subject to Iason, shepherd of the  people, and bare a son Medeus whom Cheiron the son of Philyra brought up  in the mountains. And the will of great Zeus was fulfilled.    (ll. 1003-1007) But of the daughters of Nereus, the Old man of the Sea,  Psamathe the fair goddess, was loved by Aeacus through golden Aphrodite  and bare Phocus.
