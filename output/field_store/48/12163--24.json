Of course, I woke up now and then. Who wouldn't?  All I heard was the whistle of the wind and the rush of waves so I dozed  off again.    \"After midnight the sea settled down a bit. Just at dawn my crazy craft  bumped on a sandy beach. Of course I was up and out in a hurry.    \"And there!\" He laughed. \"Leave it to the Home Guard! There on the  beach, armed with heavy old-fashioned rifles all pointed straight at me,  were three old men. And you could tell by the look on their faces that  they'd just as soon shoot me as not.\"    \"What did you do?\" Cherry whispered.    \"Do? Why! I let them take me prisoner. What else could I do? There I was  on a float marked with the Nazi cross and wearing a Nazi swastika on my  shirt.    \"I threw them a line and, when a big wave broke on shore, they hauled me  in.    \"Then I invited them to take breakfast with me. I had bacon in tins,  biscuits in a box and a jar of marmalade, also coffee. It was a grand  feed. And did those old men eat? They'd been on watch since sun-down.\"    \"And after that?\" Cherry whispered.    \"Then I showed them my water-soaked uniform, my American passport in a  waterproof pocket and my identification tag.\"    \"And then they wanted to shoot you more than ever.\" Brand laughed.    \"No--no, they didn't.\" Dave leaned back in his chair. \"They were regular  old sports. Took it all as a huge joke. Had a good laugh over it.    \"Then,\" he added, \"I traded them my float for a ride home in a  dilapidated old car. And here I am.\"    \"That float will make them a nice outpost station all winter.\" Alice  sighed with content. She wanted everyone to be comfortable and happy.    \"I'm going to America,\" Cherry said. \"The doctor advised it for my  voice. He says it's nerves.    \"There's a boatload of children going. I'm to take Peggy and Tillie.\"    \"Oh--o,\" Dave breathed softly. \"That will be swell.\" And so it would, he  thought, for Cherry.    \"But you, Alice?\" The young Lord turned to the older sister. \"Shall you  be going also?\"    \"No--o.\" Alice spoke slowly. \"I'm staying right here. There's the dairy,  you know. Jock will care for the cattle and tend to the milking. I'll  make the butter. It all goes to your mess, I suppose you know? The  butter, I mean. Or didn't you know?\"    \"I could have guessed,\" said the young Lord. \"Our butter's been  uncommonly good of late.\"    \"Thanks a lot.\" Alice made a neat bow. \"Anyway we've all got to carry  on. I shall be quite all right here with old Jock and Flash.\"    \"And we'll all welcome an opportunity to drop in for a chat now and  then.\" Dave added with a genuine sigh of satisfaction. \"We'll always be  needing someone to listen to our tall tales or to offer us consolation  when we've met with defeat.\"    \"All quite true,\" said the young Lord. And he did not laugh.    Strange days followed. The R. A. F. in war time is no respecter of  persons. Though the young Lord was of noble birth, he must suffer for  his breach of discipline. He was grounded for five days. His battered  Spitfire was taken down from the balloon cables and repaired. Armor  plate was added to his seat and fitted about his motor, so the time out  was not all loss.    Every day the two \"cubs\", Dave and Brand went up with the Lark as their  leader. Their field of patrol was narrow. Since their last battle the  Jerrys seemed to avoid that little patch of the sky over England.    One day an enemy dive-bomber wandered into their \"Sphere of Influence.\"    Seeing the direction the bomber was taking, the Lark let out a wild  whoop, barked \"Tallyho!\" into his receiver and then they were away.  Climbing into the sun they prepared to head the intruder off.    This time neither was, in the matter of speed, a match for the Lark.  There was a reason. The town for which the bomber was headed was  Renton-by-the-Sea. In that small city the Lark had spent his happy  boyhood days. Neither an industrial town nor a seaport, it was one of  those charming little cities where tired business men and their families  spend their week-ends at play.    \"My home town!\" the Lark roared into the receiver. \"He'll send some of  the very houses I've known and loved for years spouting into the sky!  Only he won't.\" Dave could hear his teeth crack.    And then the strange fellow's voice boomed forth in song. \"It's a long  way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go.\"    The Lark was now flying straight away from the sun. The dive-bomber's  pilot had not seen him. He was circling like a gull preparing for a  sudden dive when the Lark came straight at him. Not troubling to get on  his tail, the brave young defender of his home town let out a burst of  fire, then went swooping past him.    An answering burst rattled against the Lark's plane but did no harm.  Banking sharply, the Lark came up beneath the bomber, stood his Spitfire  on its tail, let out a second burst, then gripping his emergency lever  he thundered out from under and away.    He was not a second too soon. The bomber heeled over to rocket toward  the earth. It burst into flames then blew up with such force that Dave,  some distance away, was set into a spin and barely escaped a crash.    Once more singing Tipperary, The Lark led the way home. After a time he  broke off to shout:    \"The small boys of my home town will be hunting souvenirs from that  bomber for weeks to come. Oh, boy! How I wish I was a child again, just  for tonight.\"    When there was time off Dave enjoyed striding Brand's bike and riding  away to the Hideout. It was good to drop back into the old, quiet,  nearly normal life. Alice and Cherry were there and sometimes the  children. Cherry seemed to take her trip to America very quietly, as a  matter of duty. She spent hours sitting by the fire asking Dave about  his native land, but always in that quiet, matter-of-fact whisper of  hers. The children were vastly excited about the trip and eager to be  away.    At times Dave thought of the days to come when Alice would be alone with  the aged veteran and the dog, Flash. The thought troubled him a little.  There were, he supposed, enemy spies about. He had come into contact  with one of these.    Ramsey Farm seemed to have been marked for destruction. He often asked  himself why. A prisoner of war had once worked here. He had been treated  with kindness and as an equal. Why should he have gone away embittered?  \"Twisted sort of mind, I suppose,\" was his final conclusion.    Had this spy, Nicholas Schlitz brought destruction upon himself that  night by the castle, or was he still prowling about? This question  needed answering.    Late one afternoon he rode over to the castle. Coming upon a workman who  cared for the castle grounds, he stated his problem.    \"Perhaps this will answer your question,\" the man said simply. He held  out a metal disc. There was a name and number on the disc.    \"Tom and I found it two days after the bombing,\" the man said. \"There  was more to it than that, but I needn't trouble you with the details.  Tom and I, we figured it all out and reckoned the least said soonest  mended.    \"We reported this 'ere business to the proper authorities, sir,\" he went  on. \"It's all in order, sir. We should have turned the tag in at  headquarters. You'll be doin' us a service if you'll attend to that for  us, sir.    \"And,\" he added after a moment, \"you'll put in a few words of  explanation. Words come handier to you than they does to Tom and me. I'm  a thinkin' you know the details.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder.\" Dave spoke slowly. \"Thanks a lot. I'll feel better  about Alice being over at the Hideout with only old Jock and the dog to  protect her.\"    \"No doubt of that, sir,\" the man agreed as they parted.    War, Dave thought, was strange.                                       _Chapter_ XXII                            Roll Out the Barrel      Sunday came and with it the knowledge that before dawn of the next day  the good ship Queen Bess would be on her way to America. And on that  ship would ride Tillie, Peggy and their escort, Cherry.    Early Sunday morning the social worker from the subway and the little  red-headed Irish pianist arrived in a car before the door of the  Hideout.    \"All the people of our subway have read in the paper about your trip to  America,\" the social worker said to Cherry. \"They want you to attend a  farewell party.\"    \"But I can't sing. Can't even speak out loud,\" Cherry whispered.    \"We know that,\" exclaimed the little redhead. \"They know it and are  sorry for you. But you can still smile.\"    \"Yes.\" Cherry proved her answer by a happy smile.    \"That's all that matters,\" exclaimed the social worker. \"Then you will  come?\"    \"Yes.\" Cherry swallowed a happy lump in her throat. \"I'll come.\"    \"We'll all go down in my car,\" the young Lord said later in the day.  \"When the party is over it will be about time for you to take the train  for your port.\"    \"And we'll all go down to the port to see you off,\" Alice added with a  grand smile.    That party in the subway was like nothing that ever happened before. So  happy were the people at sight of their Singing Angel that they stood on  their feet and shouted for a full five minutes.    It was Sunday night, but as if they must crowd weeks of joy into one  wonderful night the people took the program in their own hands and sang  everything from \"Roll out the Barrel\" to \"God Save the King\" and from  \"I've got my Eyes on You\" to the \"Glory Song.\"    Ah yes! That was a night Cherry would not soon forget. One moment they  were bowing before the Old Rugged Cross, the next they were Rolling the  Old Chariot along. When at the very end someone started \"God be with you  till we Meet Again,\" many an eye was moist. But at the very middle of  the song a huge man who could stand no more emotion roared out in a  terrific basso:    \"We'll roll the old chariot along.\" And so, with a glorious shout they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#18)"],[1,"were alongside of her; the others were raking her fore and aft with  their shot. The young knights left the oars, sprang up to the poop and  joined in the shout of encouragement raised by the others, and then,  resuming their helmets and armour, stood ready to leap on board an enemy  as soon as they reached her. Piccolomini directed the helmsman to lay  him alongside one of the ships grappling with Santoval. As they came up,  their galley's cannon poured their fire into her, and a moment later the  knights sprang on board.    In the din of battle their shout had been unheard. The pirates thronging  the other side of their ship were intent only on overcoming the  resistance of the knights, and even the discharge of cannon had not  called their attention to their foe, until the latter, shouting the war  cry of the Order, fell suddenly upon them. A panic at once seized them.  Some were cut down almost unresistingly, but the great majority, running  to the bow or stern, threw themselves overboard and swam to the other  ships. The pirate ship on the other side of Santoval's galley instantly  threw off the grapnels and thrust off from her side, and, immediately  hauling in the sheets of the big sail, began at once to draw away, while  her three consorts made for the mouth of the bay.    \"Back to your galley, comrades,\" Piccolomini shouted, \"or with this  brisk wind they will escape us.\"    The knights at once crossed on to their own craft, the oars were got  out, and the chase began. A minute or two later Don Santoval followed  them, but soon gave up, as so large a number of the oars had been broken  when the two pirate ships ran alongside him, that it would have been  hopeless to pursue. The wind was blowing freshly, and was rapidly  increasing in strength, so that, in spite of the efforts of the galley  slaves, the pirates gradually drew away, running straight before  the wind, and aiding the effects of the sails with oars. Seeing the  hopelessness of the chase, Piccolomini abandoned it, after rowing for  two miles, and returned to the island. The other two galleys were lying  beside each other, and Piccolomini had his craft steered alongside them.    \"Thanks, Piccolomini, for arriving so opportunely,\" Santoval, who was  seated on the deck leaning against the bulwarks, said, as his fellow  commander leapt on board, and came towards him.    \"Would that I had arrived sooner, Santoval, for I see that you have been  grievously wounded!\"    \"Ay. One of the paynims' cannonballs has carried off both my legs below  the knee. The leech has been searing the wounds with a hot iron, and  says that he thinks I shall get over it; but if so I fear that my  fighting days are past, unless, indeed, I fight seated on a chair.  However, I ought not to grumble. I have lost many brave comrades, and  others are wounded more sorely than I am.\"    Sir Louis Ricord now joined them. He embraced Piccolomini warmly.    \"I never heard a more welcome shout, Piccolomini, than that which you  gave when you fell upon the Moslems, for in truth the issue of the  conflict was doubtful. I was delighted when this morning at daybreak  Santoval's galley rowed in. We had all kept watch during the night,  thinking the pirates might obtain boats and make an attack upon us; and,  with but twenty of us fit to wield a sword, our position would have been  a bad one, and at any rate they might have recaptured the prizes. We  agreed that Santoval and his knights should land at once. This they did.  Sir John Boswell had of course told me how his boat had been chased by  a fishing craft, manned by a large number of the pirates, and that he  feared the rest might similarly have escaped, and might have gone to  bring some more of Hassan Ali's ships upon us.    \"As soon as Santoval landed, some of the natives came down and told him  that there was not a pirate remaining there, the rest having started  in another boat a few minutes after the one that had chased Boswell.  Santoval left two of his men with orders to ascend to the highest spot  on the island, and to keep watch, and then brought the rest off to  his galley. Our first step was, of course, to send all the women and  children ashore. Then we consulted as to what had best be done if the  pirates should come back in force. We hoped, at any rate, that this  would not happen until you arrived. We expected that you would be here  before noon; but we decided that, should they get here before you, we  from our galley would embark on Santoval's, as it was better to fight in  one strongly manned boat than to divide our forces.    \"It was scarce half an hour after Santoval came down before the men left  on the lookout appeared on the beach. On fetching them off, they told us  that as soon as they reached the top of the hill they saw five vessels  approaching with sails and oars, and that they would be here in half an  hour at the outside. We at once abandoned my galley, brought the rowers  and the wounded here, and prepared for the fight. As you saw, they ran  their two biggest ships alongside us, and for two hours the fight went  on. They were crowded with men, who in vain strove to get a footing on  our decks. Had we only had these two to deal with, we should have had  nothing to fear, heavily manned though they were; but the other three  kept sailing backwards and forwards, discharging their guns into us as  they passed, firing not only shot, but bags of bullets.    \"Their gunners were skilful, and, as you see, they have completely  riddled our poop. Twenty knights have been killed, and eleven others are  sorely wounded. Scarce one has escaped unscathed. You may guess, then,  how welcome was your aid, which we had not expected for another three  hours. We were on the point of abandoning the waist and gathering on the  poop, which we could still have defended for a considerable time, when,  as if dropped from the skies, you fell upon the pirates, and turned the  tables. How is it that you were here so early?\"    \"We started at three o'clock, instead of waiting for daybreak. It  seemed, from the story of the two young knights, that it was possible  you might be attacked early, and, crippled as your command was, and with  four prizes on your hands, I deemed it best to come on as soon as the  rowers had had a few hours' rest.\"    \"It is well that you did so; it would have been a grievous affair had  two of our galleys been captured by the pirates. It would have been a  blow to the prestige of the Order, and would have brought such strength  to Hassan Ali and other pirate leaders that nothing short of sending out  a fleet would have recovered our ascendancy; and as every ducat we  can spare has to be spent on the fortifications, it would have been a  misfortune indeed had we been obliged to fit out such an expedition at  present.\"    \"Who have fallen, Sir Louis?\"    \"Five more of the knights of my galley--Pierre des Vignes, Raoul de  Montpelier, Ernest Schmidt, Raymond Garcia, and Albert Schenck. Here is  the list of the knights of Santoval's galley.\"    \"'Tis a long list, and a sad one,\" Piccolomini said, after reading  the names. \"With the seven who fell in your first fight, twenty-seven  knights have fallen, all brave comrades. Truly, we can ill spare such  a loss. It is true there are five prizes to show for it, and we have  struck Hassan Ali a blow that will resound through the Levant; but the  cost is heavy.\"    \"It is indeed,\" Ricord agreed. \"The four vessels are well filled with  rich spoil that the scoundrels had gathered, and I doubt not the one you  captured is equally rich. Still, had they been ten times as valuable,  the booty would be dearly purchased at such a price.\"    There was now a consultation among the leaders, and it was agreed that  six knights should be placed in each of the captured ships, with ten of  the galley slaves to work the sails, the others being equally divided  between the three galleys. They were, in the first place, to row to the  island where the pirates were imprisoned, and to slay or capture the  whole of them; afterwards they were to make direct for Rhodes; with  so numerous a fleet there was no fear of their being attacked. The  arrangements took but a short time to complete. An hour later they left  the port, the three galleys rowing ahead, while the five prizes, under  easy sail, followed them.    Sir John Boswell had been wounded, but not so seriously as to altogether  disable him, and he was in command of one of the prizes, having Sir  Adam Tedbond, Harcourt, Gervaise, and a German knight, with him. Sir  Marmaduke Lumley, who, after the first fight was over, was found, to the  surprise and pleasure of his comrades, to be still living, was, with the  rest of the wounded, on board one of the galleys. Two of the pirates  had fallen dead across him, and in the ardour of their attack on the  knights, he had lain there unnoticed until the return of Sir Louis and  his comrades had driven the pirates overboard. The leech was of opinion  that he might yet recover from his wound.    On arriving at the island, sixty of the knights disembarked. The woods  near the shore were first searched, but were found untenanted. They were  about to advance up the hill when a man appeared on the crest above them  waving a white flag. He was told to come down, and on his arrival said  that he was sent by his companions to offer to surrender, on the promise  that their lives should be spared. The knights were well pleased to be  saved the trouble of a long search through the woods, and the messenger  left at once to acquaint the pirates that their terms were accepted. In  a short time some eighty men made their way down the hill. On reaching  the beach they were disarmed, divided equally between the galleys, and  distributed among the rowers, filling up the places of those who had  been killed by the fire of the Moslems, and of the men drafted into the  prizes. They begged for food and water"]]]
