The right wing, D. H. Hill's  and Longstreet's divisions, under Longstreet, from James River to White  Oak Swamp; the left under G. W. Smith. Smith's division and Magruder's  command from White Oak Swamp, extending thence to the Mechanicsville pike,  with Jackson a hundred miles away in the Shenandoah Valley.    After careful study of the works and armaments at Drury's Bluff, I  ventured the suggestion that we recross the Chickahominy at Mechanicsville  and stand behind Beaver Dam Creek, prepared against McClellan's right when  he should be ready to march towards Richmond, and call him to relieve his  flank before crossing the river.    Although the country between McClellan's landing on the Pamunkey to the  Chickahominy was free of all obstacles on the 15th of May, the head of his  advance did not reach the banks of the latter river till the 21st. On the  16th he established his permanent depot at the White House, on the  Pamunkey, and organized two provisional army corps,--the Fifth, of  Fitz-John Porter's division, and Sykes's, under command of Porter; the  Sixth, of Franklin's and W. F. Smith's divisions, under Franklin. On the  26th the York River Railroad as far as the bridge across the Chickahominy  was repaired and in use. This, with other bridges, was speedily repaired,  and new bridges ordered built at such points as should be found necessary  to make free communication between the posts of the army.    On the 24th parties were advanced on the Williamsburg road as far as Seven  Pines, where a spirited affair occurred between General Naglee's forces  and General Hatton's brigade, the latter withdrawing a mile and a half on  the Williamsburg road. At the same time two other parties of Federals were  sent up the left bank, one under General Davidson, of the cavalry, with  artillery and infantry supports, as far as Mechanicsville, where he  encountered and dislodged a Confederate cavalry force under Colonel B. H.  Robertson and occupied the position. The third party, under Colonel  Woodbury, the Fourth Michigan Infantry and a squadron of the Second United  States Cavalry, moved up to New Bridge, where the Fifth Louisiana, Colonel  Hunt, of Semmes's brigade, was on picket. Finding the bridge well guarded,  a party, conducted by Lieutenant Bowen, Topographical Engineers, marched  up the river, concealing their movements, crossed to the west bank, and,  passing down, surprised the Fifth Louisiana, threw it into disorder, and  gained position on the west side.    Pleased at these successes, General McClellan sent a sensational despatch  to the President. His position thus masked, rested his right upon Beaver  Dam Creek, a stream that flows from the height between the Chickahominy  and Pamunkey Rivers south to its confluence with the former a few hundred  yards below Mechanicsville Bridge. Its banks are scarped, about six feet  high, and eight feet apart, making a strong natural ditch for defensive  works.    On commanding ground south of the creek admirably planned field-works were  soon constructed, which made that flank unassailable. Two miles out from  the river the creek loses its value as a defensive line. From Beaver Dam  the line was extended down the river to New Bridge, where it crossed and  reached its left out to White Oak Swamp, and there found as defensible  guard as the right at Beaver Dam Creek. The swamp is about a quarter of a  mile wide at the left, and down to the Chickahominy studded with heavy  forest-trees, always wet and boggy, but readily forded by infantry, and at  places by cavalry.    Near the middle of the line, back from New Bridge, was Stoneman's cavalry.  Fitz-John Porter's corps (Fifth) was posted at Beaver Dam Creek,  Franklin's (Sixth) two miles lower down, Sumner's (Second) near the middle  of the line, about three miles from the river. The Third and Fourth Corps  were on the south side, Kearny's division of the Third at Savage Station  of the York River Railroad, Hooker's division at White Oak Swamp Bridge,  with entrenched lines. The Fourth Corps was posted on the Williamsburg  road, Couch's division about a mile in advance of Hooker's, of the Third,  at the junction of the Nine Miles road, entrenched, and field of abatis;  Casey's division of the Third half a mile in advance of Couch's,  entrenched, and field of abatis. The point occupied by Couch's division is  known as Seven Pines. His advanced picket-guard on the Nine Miles road was  at Fair Oaks Station of the York River Railroad.    The line, which was somewhat concave towards Richmond, was strengthened at  vulnerable points by field-works. General Sumner was senior of the corps  commanders, and in command of the right wing; General Heintzelman, the  senior of the south side, was in command of the left wing. The  Chickahominy is a hundred feet wide as far up as Mechanicsville Bridge,  but narrows above to forty and thirty. Along the line of McClellan's  deployment its course was through lowlands of tangled woods that fringe  its banks, the valley seldom more than a hundred yards wide. Artillery was  posted to command all bridges and those ordered for construction. On the  26th, General McClellan ordered General Fitz-John Porter to organize a  force to march against a Confederate outpost near Hanover Court-House.  Porter took of Morell's division three brigades,--Martindale's,  Butterfield's, and McQuade's,--Berdan's Sharp-shooters and three  batteries, two regiments of cavalry under General Emory, and Benson's  horse battery; Warren's brigade to march up the right bank of the Pamunkey  in connection with operations projected for the fighting column. Porter  was the most skilful tactician and strongest fighter in the Federal army,  thoroughly trained in his profession from boyhood, and of some experience  in field work.    The Confederate outpost was commanded by Brigadier-General L. O'B. Branch,  six regiments of infantry, one battery, under Captain Latham, and a  cavalry regiment, under Colonel Robertson. General Branch was a brigadier  from civil life. The result of the affair was the discomfiture of General  Branch, with the loss of one gun and about seven hundred prisoners.  Losses in action, not including prisoners: Confederates, 265; Federals,  285.    A. P. Hill was promoted to major-general, and assigned to command of a  division at that outpost and stationed at Ashland.    On the 27th, General Johnston received information that General McDowell's  corps was at Fredericksburg, and on the march to reinforce McClellan's  right at Mechanicsville. He prepared to attack McClellan before McDowell  could reach him. To this end he withdrew Smith's division from the  Williamsburg road, relieving it by the division of D. H. Hill; withdrew  Longstreet's division from its position, and A. P. Hill's from Ashland.  The fighting column was to be under General G. W. Smith, his next in rank,  and General Whiting was assigned command of Smith's division,--the column  to consist of A. P. Hill's, Whiting's, and D. R. Jones's divisions. The  latter was posted between the Mechanicsville pike and Meadow Bridge road.  A. P. Hill was to march direct against McClellan's outpost at  Mechanicsville, Whiting to cross the river at Meadow Bridge, and D. R.  Jones at Mechanicsville, thus completing the column of attack on the east  side.    I was to march by the Mechanicsville road to the vicinity of the bridge,  and to strike down against the Federal right, west of the river, the march  to be made during the night; D. H. Hill to post a brigade on his right on  the Charles City road to guard the field to be left by his division, as  well as the line left vacant by Longstreet's division.    At nightfall the troops took up the march for their several assigned  positions. Before dark General Johnston called a number of his officers  together for instructions,--viz., Smith, Magruder, Stuart, and Longstreet.  When we were assembled, General Johnston announced later information: that  McDowell's line of march had been changed,--that he was going north.  Following the report of this information, General Smith proposed that the  plan for battle should be given up, in view of the very strong ground at  Beaver Dam Creek.[13] I urged that the plan laid against the concentrating  columns was made stronger by the change of direction of McDowell's column,  and should suggest more prompt and vigorous prosecution. In this Magruder  and Stuart joined me. The _pros_ and _cons_ were talked over till a late  hour, when at last General Johnston, weary of it, walked aside to a  separate seat. I took the opportunity to draw near him, and suggested that  the Federal position behind Beaver Dam Creek, so seriously objected to by  General Smith, could be turned by marching to and along the high ground  between the Chickahominy and Pamunkey Rivers; that the position of the  enemy when turned would be abandoned without a severe struggle, and give a  fair field for battle; that we should not lose the opportunity to await  another possible one.    General Johnston replied that he was aware of all that, but found that he  had selected the wrong officer for the work. This ended the talk, and I  asked to be allowed to halt my columns as soon as possible. The other  movements were arrested, except that of A. P. Hill's division, which was  ordered to continue its march, cross the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge,  and take position between the Meadow Bridge road and the Brooke turnpike.  The counter-order reinstated my command of the right wing, including D. H.  Hill's division on the Williamsburg road and extending to the York River  Railroad. Before leaving the conference, I announced that we would fight  on the Williamsburg road if we had to find the enemy through bayous.    The order to halt the columns found Smith's division between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#18)"],[1," provinces:--Auckland, New Plymouth (Taranaki), and  Wellington in the north island, and Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago, in the  central islands, since which period two new provinces have been  added,--Hawk Bay in the north island, and Marlborough in the middle  island.    None of the remaining seven, however, is so important or possesses such  geographical advantages as Auckland. Its coast-line is upwards of 900  nautical miles, while its more important rivers, such as the Waikato,  Waipa, Waiho (called also the Thames), Piako, and Wairao, are navigable  for small boats far into the interior. Of its 28 harbours, four, viz. Bay  of Islands, Auckland, Wangaroa, and Middle Harbour, are accessible  throughout the year for large ships, besides offering secure anchorage;  but of the remainder only eight will admit vessels of 400 tons, while the  balance can only be used by small brigs and schooners.    Auckland, the capital, lies on an isthmus about six miles in width,  dividing Waitemata Harbour from that of Manukau, the first being beyond  all question the best harbour on the east side, the former on the west.  These two harbours furnish moreover, by the numerous streams and creeks  that disembogue into them, most excellent means of communication with the  interior. The products of the country through a region of 100 miles are  conveyed to Waitemata by the Waiho and Piako rivers, while on the other  hand the Waikato and Waipa rivers bring to the harbour of Manukau the  natural products from 120 miles inland. At a comparatively small cost a  cut might be carried through the isthmus, at a point where it is only a  mile and a half wide, and direct water communication be thus effected  between the two harbours, to the manifest advantage of the country and  capital. At present the mail steamer, which comes from Sydney once a month  with the European letters, berths in Manukau Harbour, near Onehunga, on  account of the greater convenience of that harbour, and its being at a  much less distance, whence the mails are transported in coaches across  the isthmus to Auckland. Onehunga is a flourishing settlement, with  interesting volcanic formations. The road thither lies through a fertile  rolling country, which is, for the most part, reclaimed and under  cultivation, or else depastured by large herds of handsome, powerful oxen.  The three land-marks of the landscape are:--Three King's Hill, Mount Eden,  and One Tree Hill. All these, of moderate elevation, were formerly crowned  with _pahs_ or native fortified villages, and were once inhabited by a  large population, as is evidenced to this day by the quantities of human  bones found in the lava below, and by several singular terrace-like  artificial earth-works. The cottages of the settlers are handsome and  clean, but of singularly small dimensions, very much the result we suppose  of the dearness of building material and the high price of labour near  Auckland.    According to the census of 1857 the entire population of New Zealand  amounted to 108,204,[29] the white European population numbering 52,155,  of whom 16,315 persons inhabited Auckland (9038 men, and 7277 women).    The aborigines (Maori in the native tongue) are officially returned at  56,049, of whom by far the larger number, above 38,000, inhabit the  province of Auckland. Of all the savage races with whom England has come  in contact in the course of her mighty struggles to open trade and raise  humanity, the New Zealanders have hitherto proved themselves to be the  most susceptible of European civilization. More than five-sixths of their  number are already Christians, and have been baptized, and, settled down  in comfortable residences, maintain themselves by agriculture or  sailoring. More than one hundred vessels built in the colony are owned by  natives, who not alone have in their hands a considerable portion of the  coasting trade, but carry on business with the adjoining islands, as also  with New South Wales. While Bushmen, Hottentots, Caffres, Australian  negroes, all, like the Indian tribes of Canada and the United States,  present the helpless type of misery and decay, all the indications here  seem to promise that the splendid spectacle will be presented of one of  the most savage, yet highly gifted, races of the globe being raised in the  scale of humanity by education and culture, and brought permanently within  the scale of civilization. Whoever has followed with critical eye the  immense increase of this colony during the last twenty years, must indulge  this cheering anticipation not less confidently than the traveller who has  traversed the entire island totally unmolested, has been cordially  welcomed in every hut, has encountered everywhere schools and Christian  missions, and has seen the natives occupied solely with the avocations of  peace. Those native chiefs, who from contact with civilization had already  adopted the outward deportment and mode of life of the European settlers,  omitted no opportunity of confessing in language of fire the  consciousness of their former moral degradation, and of holding the  European up for admiration, as the founder of a new era of morality and  humanity in their country; nay, one Maori, who is now a zealous missionary  in the interior of the island, once avowed to his hearers that he had  himself as a boy eaten human flesh, and had first learned through the  influence of Christianity to comprehend the abominations and wild-beast  ferocity of his previous state, after which he had begun to lead a life  more worthy of the dignity of manhood.    The members of our Expedition also enjoyed the opportunity of attending a  Mass-meeting of Maories in the Takapuna district on the north shore of  Waitemata Harbour, where they gathered, from the orations of the most  influential chiefs and speakers, the liveliest conviction of their  fidelity and attachment to the Queen of England and her government. We  insert here a pretty full description of this remarkable meeting, as well  as a brief sketch of the most interesting manners and customs of the  aborigines of New Zealand, in order to enlighten the reader as to the  justice of the universally expressed distrust of the capacity of the Maori  for civilization, and the more readily to form an idea of the alarm and  astonishment of the English Government, on being suddenly informed that  the entire native population had rose in arms against the European  settlers.    A wealthy and much-respected chief, named Patuoni, has been in the habit  for many years past of inviting all the friendly tribes residing in his  neighbourhood, as well as the most distinguished of the white settlers,  to a great popular fete every Christmas. The intelligence that on the  present occasion the \"Kavana\" (Governor), or Commander of one of Queen  Victoria's allies, would attend with a numerous suite, had caused much  agreeable excitement among the Maori, and they offered to send some  war-canoes and two whale-boats to the coast opposite in order to convey  the guests. The staff of the Expedition were however already at the place  of meeting in the Takapuna district, when the war-canoes arrived at the  usual place of embarkation in Auckland. Here we saw a number of large  tents pitched on an eminence, and gaily adorned with English and other  flags, under which were very long narrow tables, about two feet high,  covered with neat little baskets elegantly woven of the leaves of the New  Zealand flax, in which were cooked potatoes, roast-pork, and fish. The  guests, 300 or 400 in number, sat on the ground, which was thickly covered  with fern freshly gathered, some sitting cross-legged, others squatting on  their heels, zealously excavating the food with their fingers, for the use  of forks has not yet become a fashion among the Maori. The chief beverage  was tea, and all around on the grass adjoining the tent might be seen  improvised fire-places, on every one of which a huge kettle of boiling  water was singing. The gait and extravagance however of but too many  indicated that less harmless drinks were being supplied close by. Each as  soon as he had finished his repast lighted his pipe, and mingled with the  groups that were chatting about. Tobacco smoking has become a positive  passion with both sexes, and even among the children of the poorer classes  it is no unusual thing to see the infant carried in the arms coolly take  the pipe out of its mother's mouth and begin to smoke it! The earthen  pipe, broken off so short that there is barely sufficient to enable the  teeth to take hold,--in one word, summing up everything to English  ears--the \"cuttie\"--is most in favour.    Scarcely was it rumoured that the Commander of the Austrian frigate with  his staff were at hand, ere the whole crowd, which up to that moment had  been abandoning itself to enjoyment, suddenly dispersed _pele-mele_ in  wildest confusion. The gay flags were removed from the tent-peaks, and  made to veil the scene of uproar; a quick but monotonous song, alternating  with measured stamping with the feet, was droned out, the chiefs  brandishing aloft and swinging with wild gesticulations their costly clubs  (_meri-meri_, literally \"Fire of the Gods\"), made of primitive rock. Each  Maori who had a club beside him swung it with wild gesticulation, while  the rest tossed in the air the ends of their woollen garments. In order to  give us a more complete idea of their ancient customs, a war-dance  succeeded to this, in which men, women, and children took a part. Although  this is nothing but a confused advance and retreat of two bodies of people  arranged opposite each other in regular order, who suddenly rush towards  each other with impetuous vehemence and loud discordant cries, yet the  wild shrieks, the rapid motions of those who took part in it, the rolling  of the eyes, the protrusion of the tongues, combined to make a formidable  impression, and to give some"]]]
