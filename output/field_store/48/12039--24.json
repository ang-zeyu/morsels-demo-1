All in all, the adaptation of insect  to flower here displayed is one of rare exquisiteness.\"[C]       [C] \"Nature Sketches in Temperate America\", p. 83.    Dr. Hancock found that the butterflies were able to cling on the  flowers during strong winds very persistently, so that even when a  storm blew across the sand dunes they were likely to remain in  position. They also have the instinct to rest very quietly after they  have lit upon the clustered flower heads.       =The Olympian Orange-tip=    _Synchloe olympia_    In various parts of the Southern states there is at least one other  Orange-tip butterfly which is found occasionally in connection with  the Falcate Orange-tip. It was named Olympia many years ago by William  H. Edwards. It is a delicate white species marked with black and  yellow very lightly both above and below, the yellow showing only on  the under side of the hind wings and that part of the front wing which  is exposed when the insect is at rest. Strictly speaking, this is not  an Orange-tip because the orange color is lacking in both sexes.    This is rather a rare species which occurs occasionally from the  Atlantic states to the Great Plains south of a line drawn from  northern Maryland to northern Missouri. Like its allies the larvae  feed upon various cruciferous plants, the hedge mustard being one of  these and the adults visit the flowers of the same family. They  doubtless have habits similar to those of the Falcate Orange-tip, and  the extreme delicacy of color must render them practically invisible  when resting upon the small white flowers of most crucifers.

Beecroft_   _See page 83_         THE IMPORTED CABBAGE BUTTERFLY         Caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterflies]    Most of the Orange-tip butterflies are found on the Pacific Slope,  ranging from Alaska southward, several of them being especially  abundant in the western mountain regions. About eight species are  recognized as belonging to our fauna, some of which have several  well-marked varieties.      _Synopsis of the Orange-tips_    _Falcate Orange-tip_ (_Synchloe genutia_, _Anthocaris genutia_ or  _Euchloe genutia_). Expanse 1 2/5 inches. Tips of front wings  projecting in a hooked angle. Orange blotch on upper surface near tip  in male, absent in female.    _Olympian Orange-tip_ (_Synchloe olympia_, _Euchloe olympia_ or  _Anthocaris olympia_). Expanse 1 1/2 inches. Wings white above in both  sexes with greenish black markings at base of all wings and along  front margin of front wings, especially at apex. No orange patch.          THE TRIBE OF THE YELLOWS      A large proportion of our most abundant and conspicuous butterflies  belong to the Tribe of the Yellows. Sometimes it is called the Tribe  of the Red-horns because the antennae of the living insects are so  often red. These insects vary in size from the large Brimstones or  Cloudless Sulphurs, expanding three inches, to the delicate little  Dainty Sulphur, expanding scarcely an inch. The distinctive  characteristics of the tribe are found in the very gradual enlargement  of the joints of the antennae that form the club, and the stout palpi,  the last joints of each of the latter being short.       =The Brimstone or Cloudless Sulphur=    _Callidrayas eubule_    Practically all northern butterflies are variously marked in different  colors, while the butterflies of tropical regions are commonly tinted  in monotone, though often showing a splendid iridescence. One with  very little experience can tell the look of a tropical butterfly and  would be likely to say at once that the Cloudless Sulphur is one of  these. The upper surface of the wings of the male is a clear plain  sulphur with merely the narrowest possible fringe of brown around the  margin made only by the colored marginal scales. The under surface is  lighter and sparsely dotted in brown. In the females the marginal  brown takes on the shape of a series of small crescents and there is a  single round brown eye-spot just in front of the middle of each front  wing.    While the Cloudless Sulphur is without doubt essentially a tropical  species it has an extraordinary geographical range. It is extremely  abundant in Mexico, Cuba, and the tropical zone in South America. It  extends south even to northern Patagonia and north to New England,  Wisconsin, and Nebraska.    Presumably in the tropics this species breeds continuously, one  generation following another in regular succession unless interrupted  by drought or other natural phenomena. In our Southern states there is  more or less interruption by the winter season, so that it is commonly  considered to have only two broods, the butterflies hibernating.  Farther north there is probably only one brood in summer, and perhaps  not even that in the extreme limit of its range. For there is pretty  good evidence that the specimens seen in the Northern states are  migrants from the south, coming singly or in scattered flocks in early  summer, and if they lay eggs the butterflies of the new generation  return south in autumn. But the precise conditions are not well known  and need careful observations in various localities.    The life-story of a generation of these butterflies is much like that  of the other Yellows. The eggs are laid, one in a place, on the  leaflets of various species of wild senna (_Cassia_) and soon hatch  into cylindrical caterpillars that devour the tender leaflets. In a  few weeks the caterpillars mature and change to curious and  characteristic chrysalids. The head projects in the shape of a cone  and the back is so concave as to give the side view of the chrysalis a  very striking appearance.    Like so many of the Yellows this butterfly is sun-loving and social in  its habits. Great numbers flock together, their large size and bright  coloring rendering them very conspicuous. They often alight on the  ground to sip moisture when they have been likened to beds of yellow  crocuses. They also fly long distances in flocks that attract much  attention. It is likely that the northward distribution takes place in  summer through such migrating hosts.      _Other Sulphur Butterflies_    The Large Orange Sulphur is a closely related butterfly of about the  same size, in which the coloring is uniformly orange-yellow instead of  lemon-yellow. It also belongs to the tropics, occurring in our extreme  Southern states and ranging occasionally as far north as Nebraska.    The Red-barred Sulphur is another splendid butterfly, somewhat larger  than the Brimstone, which is easily distinguished by the broad reddish  bar across the upper surface of the front wings. It is tropical but  migrates rarely even as far north as Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.       =The Dog's-head Butterfly=    _Meganostoma caesonia_    The Dog's-head butterfly furnishes one of the most remarkable examples  of accidental resemblance in wing markings that can be found in the  whole order of scale-winged insects. It is comparable with the skull  and crossbones on the back of the death's-head moth. In the butterfly  the middle of the front wings has a broad band of yellow against a  black margin on each side and the yellow outlines make an excellent  silhouette of the profile of a poodle with a large black eye-spot in  exactly the proper place. The females are less brightly colored than  the males but they still show the dog's-head silhouette.    This is a southern species, which occasionally strays as far north as  New York City, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The larvae feed on  species of Amorpha and are believed to be three-brooded in southern  regions where the butterfly occurs.    The California Dog's-head is even more beautiful than the southern  species. It is remarkable for its pink and purple iridescence--a  characteristic which is not common in the butterflies of the Yellow  and the White Tribes. The silhouette of the Dog's-head is less perfect  than in the more eastern species, and the yellow color tones are more  tinged with orange. The female is strikingly different, the wings  being plain pale yellowish buff marked only with a round blackish  eye-spot near the middle of each front wing and the barest suggestion  of a dark line around the extreme margin.       =The Clouded Sulphur=    _Eurymus philodice_    It is an interesting fact that the butterfly which one is most likely  to find in fields and along roadsides during practically all the weeks  of summer has seldom if ever been noted as a destructive insect. The  Clouded Sulphur is probably the commonest species in its group. There  may be times when the White Cabbage butterfly or other forms are more  abundant, but the Clouded Sulphur retains its place season after  season, with comparatively little noticeable variation in its numbers.  This is doubtless an illustration of an insect which has established  such relations with its food plants and its various insect and other  enemies that it remains in a fairly stable equilibrium--an example of  what is often called the balance of nature.    The Clouded Sulphur is about the only medium-sized yellow butterfly  generally found in the Northeastern states. The adults may be seen  from spring until autumn. They lay eggs upon clover and other plants.  These eggs hatch into small green caterpillars that feed upon the  leaves and are protectively colored so they are comparatively seldom  seen. When the food plant is disturbed they drop to the ground,  crawling up again upon stems and leaves when the disturbance is over.    These caterpillars moult several times during their growth. When full  grown they find such shelter as they are able and each spins a silken  web over part of the surface. It then fastens its hind legs into this  web and later "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#18)"],[1," H2O, steam, is found from the symbol as follows:  (2 + 16) / 2 = 9. To obtain the vapor density of any compound  from the formula, we have only to divide its molecular weight by  two. Find the vapor density of HCl, N2O, NO, C12H22O11, Cl, CO2,  HF, SO2. Explain each case.    The half-molecule, instead of the whole, is taken; because our  standard is the hydrogen atom, the smallest portion of matter, by  weight, known to science.    How many criths in a liter of HCl? How many grams? Compute the  number of criths and of grams in one liter of the compounds whose  symbols appear above.    PROBLEMS.    (1) A certain volume of H weighs 0.36 g. at standard temperature  and pressure. How many liters does it contain? If one liter  weighs 0.09 g., to weigh 0.36 g. it will take 0.36 / 0.09 = 4  liters.    (2) How many liters, or criths, of H in 63 g.? 2.7 g.? 1 g.? 5  g.? 250 g.? Explain each.    (3) Suppose the gas to be twice as heavy as H, how many liters in  0.36 g.? A liter of the gas will weigh 0.18 g. (0.09 X 2). In  0.36 g. there will be 0.36 / 0.18 = 2. Answer the question for 63  g., 2.7 g., etc.    (4) How many liters of Cl in each of the above numbers of grams?    (5) How many of HCl? H2O (steam)? CO2? Explain fully every case.    Vapor density is very easily determined from the formula by the  method given above. But in practice the formula is obtained from  the vapor density, and hence the method there given has to be  reversed.    173. Vapor Density of Oxygen.--Suppose we were to obtain the  vapor density of O. We should carefully seal and weigh a given  volume, say a liter, at a noted temperature and barometric  pressure, which are reducedto 0 degrees and 760 mm, and compare  it with the weight of the same volume of H. This has been done  repeatedly, and O has been found to weigh 16 times as much as H,  volume for volume, or, more exactly, 15.96+. Now a liter of each  gas has the same number of molecules, therefore the O molecule  weighs 16 times the H molecule. The half-molecule of each has the  same proportion, and the vapor density of O is 16. Atomic weight  is obtained in a very different way.    PROBLEMS.    (1) A liter of Cl is found to weigh 3.195 g. Compute its vapor  density, and explain fully.    (2) A liter of Hg vapor, under standard conditions, weighs 9 g.  Find its vapor density, and explain.    The vapor density of only a few elements has been satisfactorily  determined. See page 12. Some cannot be vaporized; others can be,  but only under conditions which prevent weighing them. The vapor  density of very many compounds also is unknown.    (3) A liter of CO2 weighs 1.98 g. Find the vapor density, and  from that the molecular weight, remembering that the latter is  twice the former. See whether it corresponds to that obtained  from the formula, CO2. This is,in fact, the way a formula is  ascertained, if the atomic weights of its elements are known.    (4) A liter of a compound gas weighs 2.88 g. Analysis shows that  its weight is half S and half O. As the atomic weight of S is 32,  and that of O is 16, what is the symbol for the gas?    Solution. Its molecular weight is 64, i.e. (2.88=0.09) X 2, of  which 32 is S and 32 O. The atomic weight of S is 32, hence there  is one atom of S, while of O there are two atoms. The formula is  SO2.    (5) A liter of a compound gas, which is found to contain 1 C and  3 O by weight, weighs 1.26 g. What is its formula? Atomic weights  are taken from page 12. Prove your answer.    (6) A liter of a compound of N and O weighs 1.98 g. The N is  7/11; and the O 4/11. What is the gas?    (7) A compound of N and H gas weighs 0.765 g. to the liter. The N  is 14/17 of the whole, the H 3/17. What gas is it? CHAPTER XXXV.    ATOMIC WEIGHT.    174. Definition.--We have seen that the molecular weight of a  compound, as well as of most elements, is obtained from the vapor  density by doubling the latter. It remains to explain how atomic  weights are obtained. The term is rather misleading. The atomic  weight of an element is its least combining weight, the smallest  portion that enters into chemical union, which is, of course, the  weight of an atom.    175. Atomic Weight of Oxygen.--Suppose we wish to find the atomic  weight of oxygen. We must find the smallest proportion by weight  in which it occurs in any compound. This can only be done by  analyzing all the compounds of O that can be vaporized. As  illustrative of these compounds take the six following:--                                                  Wt. of other  Names.              V. d.  Mol. Wt.  Wt. of O.   Elem.        Symbol.  Carbon monoxide...    14       28 16    12           ?  Carbon dioxide....    22       44 32    12           ?  Hydrogen monoxide...   9       18 16     2           ?  Nitrogen monoxide...  22       44 16    28           ?  Nitrogen trioxide...  38       76 48    28           ?  Nitrogen pentoxide... 54      108 80    28           ?      176. Molecular Symbols.--From the vapor density of the gases--  column 2--we obtain their molecular weight-- column 3. To find  the proportion of O, it must be separated by chemical means from  its compounds and separately weighed. These relative weights are  given in column 4. Now the smallest weight of O which unites in  any case is its atomic weight. If any compound of O should in  future be found in which its combining weight is 8 or 4, that  would be called its atomic weight. By dividing the numbers in  column 4, wt. of O, by 16, the atomic weight of O, we obtain the  number of O atoms in the molecule. Subtracting the weights of O  from the molecular weights, we have the parts of the other  elements, column 5, and dividing these by the atomic weight of  the respective elements, we have the number of atoms of those  elements, these last, combined with the number of O atoms, give  the symbol. In this way complete the last column.    Show how to get the atomic weight of Cl from these compounds,  arranging them in tabular form, and completing as above: HCl,  KCl, NaCl, ZnCl2, MgCl2; the atomic weight of N in these: N2O,  NO, NH3.    177. Molecular and Atomic Volumes.--We thus see that vapor  density and atomic weight are obtained in two quite different  ways. In the case of elements the two are usually identical, i.e.  with the few whose vapor density is known; but this is not always  true, and it leads to interesting conclusions regarding atomic  volume. In O both vapor density and atomic weight are 16. This  gives 2 atoms of O to the molecule, i.e. the molecular weight /  the atomic weight. The size of an O atom is therefore half the  gaseous molecule, and is represented by one square. S has a vapor  density and an atomic weight of 32 each. Compute the number of  atoms in the molecule. Compute for I, in which the two are  identical, 127. P has an atomic weight of 31, while its vapor  density is 62. Its molecule must consist of 4 atoms, each half  the size of the H atom, The vapor density of As is 150, the  atomic weight 75. Compute the number of atoms in its molecule,  and represent their relative size. Hg has an atomic weight of  200, a vapor density of 100. Compute as before, and compare the  results with those on page 12. Ozone has an atomic weight of 16,  a vapor density 24. Compute.    Chapter XXXVI.    DIFFUSION AND CONDENSATION OF GASES.    178. Diffusion of Gases.--Oxygen is 16 times as heavy as H. If  the two gases were mixed, without combining, in a confined space,  it might be supposed that O would settle to the bottom and H rise  to the top. This would, in fact, take place at first, but only  for an instant, for all gases tend to diffuse or become  intimately mixed. The lighter the gas the more quickly it  diffuses.    179. Law of Diffusion of Gases.--The diffusibility of gases  varies inversely as the square roots of their vapor densities.  Compare the diffusibility of H with that of O. dif. H:dif. O::  sqrt(16): sqrt(1), or dif: H: dif. O:: 4: 1.    That is to say, if H and O be set free from separate receivers in  a room, the H will become intermingled with the atmosphere four  times as quickly as the O. Compare the diffusibility of O and N;  of Cl and H. Take the atomic weights of these, since they are the  same as the vapor densities. In case of a compound gas, half the  molecular weight must be taken for the vapor density; e.g. dif.  N20: dif. O.:: sqrt(16): sqrt(22).    180. Cause.--Diffusion is due to molecular motion; the lighter  the gas the more rapid the vibration of its molecules. Compare  the diffusibility of CO2 and that of Cl; of HCl and SO2; of HF  and I.    181. Liquefaction and Solidification of Gases.--Water boils at  100 degrees, under standard pressure, though evaporating at all  temperatures; it vaporizes at a lower point if the pressure be  less, as on a mountain, and at a higher temperature if the  pressure be greater, as at points below the sea level. Alcohol  boils at 78 degrees, standard pressure, and every liquid has a  point of temperature and pressure above which it must pass into  the gaseous state. Likewise every gas has a critical temperature  above which it cannot be liquefied at any pressure.    This condition was not recognized formerly, and before 1877, O,  H, N, C4, CO, NO, etc., had not been liquefied, though put under  a pressure of more than 2,000 atmospheres. They were called  permanent gases. In 1877 Cailletet and Pictet liquefied and  solidified these and others. The lowest temperature, about -225  degrees, was produced by suddenly releasing the pressure from  solid N to 4mm, which caused it rapidly to evaporate.  Evaporation, especially under diminished pressure, always lowers  the temperature by withdrawing heat.    These low degrees are indicated by a H thermometer, or if too low  for that, by a \"thermo-electric couple\" of copper and German  silver.    The pupil can easily liquefy SO, by passing it through a U-tube  which is surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt in a large  receiver."]]]
