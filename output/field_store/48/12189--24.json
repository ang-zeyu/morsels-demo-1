[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5340"],[0,"Further Chronicles of Avonlea (#18)"],[1,"; she never allowed me to associate on a level of  equality with the young people of Newbridge.  We must be very  nice and kind and affable to them--_noblesse oblige_, as it  were--but we must never forget that we were Merediths.    When I was twenty-five, Hugh Blair came to Newbridge, having  bought a farm near the village.  He was a stranger, from Lower  Carmody, and so was not imbued with any preconceptions of  Meredith superiority.  In his eyes I was just a girl like  others--a girl to be wooed and won by any man of clean life and  honest heart.  I met him at a little Sunday-School picnic over at  Avonlea, which I attended because of my class.  I thought him  very handsome and manly.  He talked to me a great deal, and at  last he drove me home.  The next Sunday evening he walked up from  church with me.    Hester was away, or, of course, this would never have happened.  She had gone for a month's visit to distant friends.    In that month I lived a lifetime.  Hugh Blair courted me as the  other girls in Newbridge were courted.  He took me out driving  and came to see me in the evenings, which we spent for the most  part in the garden.  I did not like the stately gloom and  formality of our old Meredith parlor, and Hugh never seemed to  feel at ease there.  His broad shoulders and hearty laughter were  oddly out of place among our faded, old-maidish furnishings.    Mary Sloane was very much pleased at Hugh's visit.  She had  always resented the fact that I had never had a \"beau,\" seeming  to think it reflected some slight or disparagement upon me.  She  did all she could to encourage him.    But when Hester returned and found out about Hugh she was very  angry--and grieved, which hurt me far more.  She told me that I  had forgotten myself and that Hugh's visits must cease.    I had never been afraid of Hester before, but I was afraid of her  then.  I yielded.  Perhaps it was very weak of me, but then I was  always weak.  I think that was why Hugh's strength had appealed  so to me.  I needed love and protection.  Hester, strong and  self-sufficient, had never felt such a need.  She could not  understand.  Oh, how contemptuous she was.    I told Hugh timidly that Hester did not approve of our friendship  and that it must end.  He took it quietly enough, and went away.  I thought he did not care much, and the thought selfishly made my  own heartache worse.  I was very unhappy for a long time, but I  tried not to let Hester see it, and I don't think she did.  She  was not very discerning in some things.    After a time I got over it; that is, the heartache ceased to ache  all the time.  But things were never quite the same again.  Life  always seemed rather dreary and empty, in spite of Hester and my  roses and my Sunday-School.    I supposed that Hugh Blair would find him a wife elsewhere, but  he did not.  The years went by and we never met, although I saw  him often at church.  At such times Hester always watched me very  closely, but there was no need of her to do so.  Hugh made no  attempt to meet me, or speak with me, and I would not have  permitted it if he had.  But my heart always yearned after him.  I was selfishly glad he had not married, because if he had I  could not have thought and dreamed of him--it would have been  wrong.  Perhaps, as it was, it was foolish; but it seemed to me  that I must have something, if only foolish dreams, to fill my  life.    At first there was only pain in the thought of him, but  afterwards a faint, misty little pleasure crept in, like a mirage  from a land of lost delight.    Ten years slipped away thus.  And then Hester died.  Her illness  was sudden and short; but, before she died, she asked me to  promise that I would never marry Hugh Blair.    She had not mentioned his name for years.  I thought she had  forgotten all about him.    \"Oh, dear sister, is there any need of such a promise?\" I asked,  weeping.  \"Hugh Blair does not want to marry me now.  He never  will again.\"    \"He has never married--he has not forgotten you,\" she said  fiercely.  \"I could not rest in my grave if I thought you would  disgrace your family by marrying beneath you.  Promise me,  Margaret.\"    I promised.  I would have promised anything in my power to make  her dying pillow easier.  Besides, what did it matter?  I was  sure that Hugh would never think of me again.    She smiled when she heard me, and pressed my hand.    \"Good little sister--that is right.  You were always a good girl,  Margaret--good and obedient, though a little sentimental and  foolish in some ways.  You are like our mother--she was always  weak and loving.  I took after the Merediths.\"    She did, indeed.  Even in her coffin her dark, handsome features  preserved their expression of pride and determination.  Somehow,  that last look of her dead face remained in my memory, blotting  out the real affection and gentleness which her living face had  almost always shown me.  This distressed me, but I could not help  it.  I wished to think of her as kind and loving, but I could  remember only the pride and coldness with which she had crushed  out my new-born happiness.  Yet I felt no anger or resentment  towards her for what she had done.  I knew she had meant it for  the best--my best.  It was only that she was mistaken.    And then, a month after she had died, Hugh Blair came to me and  asked me to be his wife.  He said he had always loved me, and  could never love any other woman.    All my old love for him reawakened.  I wanted to say yes--to feel  his strong arms about me, and the warmth of his love enfolding  and guarding me.  In my weakness I yearned for his strength.    But there was my promise to Hester--that promise give by her  deathbed.  I could not break it, and I told him so.  It was the  hardest thing I had ever done.    He did not go away quietly this time.  He pleaded and reasoned  and reproached.  Every word of his hurt me like a knife-thrust.  But I could not break my promise to the dead.  If Hester had been  living I would have braved her wrath and her estrangement and  gone to him.  But she was dead and I could not do it.    Finally he went away in grief and anger.  That was three weeks  ago--and now I sat alone in the moonlit rose-garden and wept for  him.  But after a time my tears dried and a very strange feeling  came over me.  I felt calm and happy, as if some wonderful love  and tenderness were very near me.    And now comes the strange part of my story--the part which will  not, I suppose, be believed.  If it were not for one thing I  think I should hardly believe it myself.  I should feel tempted  to think I had dreamed it.  But because of that one thing I know  it was real.  The night was very calm and still.  Not a breath of  wind stirred.  The moonshine was the brightest I had ever seen.  In the middle of the garden, where the shadow of the poplars did  not fall, it was almost as bright as day.  One could have read  fine print.  There was still a little rose glow in the west, and  over the airy boughs of the tall poplars one or two large, bright  stars were shining.  The air was sweet with a hush of dreams, and  the world was so lovely that I held my breath over its beauty.    Then, all at once, down at the far end of the garden, I saw a  woman walking.  I thought at first that it must be Mary Sloane;  but, as she crossed a moonlit path, I saw it was not our old  servant's stout, homely figure.  This woman was tall and erect.    Although no suspicion of the truth came to me, something about  her reminded me of Hester.  Even so had Hester liked to wander  about the garden in the twilight.  I had seen her thus a thousand  times.    I wondered who the woman could be.  Some neighbor, of course.  But what a strange way for her to come!  She walked up the garden  slowly in the poplar shade.  Now and then she stooped, as if to  caress a flower, but she plucked none.  Half way up she out in to  the moonlight and walked across the plot of grass in the center  of the garden.  My heart gave a great throb and I stood up.  She  was quite near to me now--and I saw that it was Hester.    I can hardly say just what my feelings were at this moment.  I  know that I was not surprised.  I was frightened and yet I was  not frightened.  Something in me shrank back in a sickening  terror; but _I_, the real I, was not frightened.  I knew that  this was my sister, and that there could be no reason why I  should be frightened of her, because she loved me still, as she  had always done.  Further than this I was not conscious of any  coherent thought, either of wonder or attempt at reasoning.    Hester paused when she came to within a few steps of me.  In the  moonlight I saw her face quite plainly.  It wore an expression I  had never before seen on it--a humble, wistful, tender look.  Often in life Hester had looked lovingly, even tenderly, upon me;  but always, as it were, through a mask of pride and sternness.  This was gone now, and I felt nearer to her than ever before.  I  knew suddenly that she understood me.  And then the  half-conscious awe and terror some part of me had felt vanished,  and I only realized that Hester was here, and that there was no  terrible gulf of change between us.    Hester beckoned to me and said,    \"Come.\"    I stood up and followed her out of the garden.  We walked side by  side down our lane, under the willows and out to the road, which  lay long and still in that bright, calm moonshine.  I felt as if  I were in a dream, moving at the bidding of a will not my own,  which I could not have disputed even if I had wished to do so.  But I did not wish it; I had only the feeling of a strange,  boundless content.    We went down the road between the growths of young fir that  bordered it.  I smelled their balsam as we passed, and noticed  how clearly and darkly their pointed tops came out against the  sky.  I heard the tread of my own feet on little twigs and plants  in our way, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#18)"],[1,"that followed convinced him of the change. Something had come  between them. Kilmeny seemed as far away from him as if she had in  truth, like her namesake of the ballad, sojourned for seven years in the  land \"where the rain never fell and the wind never blew,\" and had come  back washed clean from all the affections of earth.    Eric had a bad week of it; but he determined to put an end to it by  plain speaking. One evening in the orchard he told her of his love.    It was an evening in August, with wheat fields ripening to their  harvestry--a soft violet night made for love, with the distant murmur of  an unquiet sea on a rocky shore sounding through it. Kilmeny was sitting  on the old bench where he had first seen her. She had been playing for  him, but her music did not please her and she laid aside the violin with  a little frown.    It might be that she was afraid to play--afraid that her new emotions  might escape her and reveal themselves in music. It was difficult  to prevent this, so long had she been accustomed to pour out all her  feelings in harmony. The necessity for restraint irked her and made of  her bow a clumsy thing which no longer obeyed her wishes. More than ever  at that instant did she long for speech--speech that would conceal and  protect where dangerous silence might betray.    In a low voice that trembled with earnestness Eric told her that he  loved her--that he had loved her from the first time he had seen her  in that old orchard. He spoke humbly but not fearfully, for he believed  that she loved him, and he had little expectation of any rebuff.    \"Kilmeny, will you be my wife?\" he asked finally, taking her hands in  his.    Kilmeny had listened with averted face. At first she had blushed  painfully but now she had grown very pale. When he had finished speaking  and was waiting for her answer, she suddenly pulled her hands away, and,  putting them over her face, burst into tears and noiseless sobs.    \"Kilmeny, dearest, have I alarmed you? Surely you knew before that I  loved you. Don't you care for me?\" Eric said, putting his arm about her  and trying to draw her to him. But she shook her head sorrowfully, and  wrote with compressed lips,    \"Yes, I do love you, but I will never marry you, because I cannot  speak.\"    \"Oh, Kilmeny,\" said Eric smiling, for he believed his victory won, \"that  doesn't make any difference to me--you know it doesn't, sweetest. If you  love me that is enough.\"    But Kilmeny only shook her head again. There was a very determined look  on her pale face. She wrote,    \"No, it is not enough. It would be doing you a great wrong to marry you  when I cannot speak, and I will not do it because I love you too much to  do anything that would harm you. Your world would think you had done  a very foolish thing and it would be right. I have thought it all over  many times since something Aunt Janet said made me understand, and I  know I am doing right. I am sorry I did not understand sooner, before  you had learned to care so much.\"    \"Kilmeny, darling, you have taken a very absurd fancy into that dear  black head of yours. Don't you know that you will make me miserably  unhappy all my life if you will not be my wife?\"    \"No, you think so now; and I know you will feel very badly for a time.  Then you will go away and after awhile you will forget me; and then you  will see that I was right. I shall be very unhappy, too, but that is  better than spoiling your life. Do not plead or coax because I shall not  change my mind.\"    Eric did plead and coax, however--at first patiently and smilingly,  as one might argue with a dear foolish child; then with vehement and  distracted earnestness, as he began to realize that Kilmeny meant what  she said. It was all in vain. Kilmeny grew paler and paler, and her eyes  revealed how keenly she was suffering. She did not even try to argue  with him, but only listened patiently and sadly, and shook her head. Say  what he would, entreat and implore as he might, he could not move her  resolution a hairs-breadth.    Yet he did not despair; he could not believe that she would adhere to  such a resolution; he felt sure that her love for him would eventually  conquer, and he went home not unhappily after all. He did not understand  that it was the very intensity of her love which gave her the strength  to resist his pleading, where a more shallow affection might have  yielded. It held her back unflinchingly from doing him what she believed  to be a wrong.        CHAPTER XV. AN OLD, UNHAPPY, FAR-OFF THING    The next day Eric sought Kilmeny again and renewed his pleadings, but  again in vain. Nothing he could say, no argument which he could advance,  was of any avail against her sad determination. When he was finally  compelled to realize that her resolution was not to be shaken, he went  in his despair to Janet Gordon. Janet listened to his story with concern  and disappointment plainly visible on her face. When he had finished she  shook her head.    \"I'm sorry, Master. I can't tell you how sorry I am. I had hoped for  something very different. HOPED! I have PRAYED for it. Thomas and I are  getting old and it has weighed on my mind for years--what was to become  of Kilmeny when we would be gone. Since you came I had hoped she would  have a protector in you. But if Kilmeny says she will not marry you I am  afraid she'll stick to it.\"    \"But she loves me,\" cried the young man, \"and if you and her uncle speak  to her--urge her--perhaps you can influence her--\"    \"No, Master, it wouldn't be any use. Oh, we will, of course, but it will  not be any use. Kilmeny is as determined as her mother when once she  makes up her mind. She has always been good and obedient for the most  part, but once or twice we have found out that there is no moving her if  she does resolve upon anything. When her mother died Thomas and I wanted  to take her to church. We could not prevail on her to go. We did not  know why then, but now I suppose it was because she believed she was  so very ugly. It is because she thinks so much of you that she will not  marry you. She is afraid you would come to repent having married a dumb  girl. Maybe she is right--maybe she is right.\"    \"I cannot give her up,\" said Eric stubbornly. \"Something must be done.  Perhaps her defect can be remedied even yet. Have you ever thought of  that? You have never had her examined by a doctor qualified to pronounce  on her case, have you?\"    \"No, Master, we never took her to anyone. When we first began to  fear that she was never going to talk Thomas wanted to take her to  Charlottetown and have her looked to. He thought so much of the child  and he felt terrible about it. But her mother wouldn't hear of it being  done. There was no use trying to argue with her. She said that it would  be no use--that it was her sin that was visited on her child and it  could never be taken away.\"    \"And did you give in meekly to a morbid whim like that?\" asked Eric  impatiently.    \"Master, you didn't know my sister. We HAD to give in--nobody could hold  out against her. She was a strange woman--and a terrible woman in many  ways--after her trouble. We were afraid to cross her for fear she would  go out of her mind.\"    \"But, could you not have taken Kilmeny to a doctor unknown to her  mother?\"    \"No, that was not possible. Margaret never let her out of her sight,  not even when she was grown up. Besides, to tell you the whole truth,  Master, we didn't think ourselves that it would be much use to try to  cure Kilmeny. It WAS a sin that made her as she is.\"    \"Aunt Janet, how can you talk such nonsense? Where was there any sin?  Your sister thought herself a lawful wife. If Ronald Fraser thought  otherwise--and there is no proof that he did--HE committed a sin, but  you surely do not believe that it was visited in this fashion on his  innocent child!\"    \"No, I am not meaning that, Master. That wasn't where Margaret did  wrong; and though I never liked Ronald Fraser over much, I must say this  in his defence--I believe he thought himself a free man when he married  Margaret. No, it's something else--something far worse. It gives me a  shiver whenever I think of it. Oh, Master, the Good Book is right when  it says the sins of the parents are visited on the children. There isn't  a truer word in it than that from cover to cover.\"    \"What, in heaven's name, is the meaning of all this?\" exclaimed Eric.  \"Tell me what it is. I must know the whole truth about Kilmeny. Do not  torment me.\"    \"I am going to tell you the story, Master, though it will be like  opening an old wound. No living person knows it but Thomas and me. When  you hear it you will understand why Kilmeny can't speak, and why it  isn't likely that there can ever be anything done for her. She doesn't  know the truth and you must never tell her. It isn't a fit story for her  ears, especially when it is about her mother. Promise me that you will  never tell her, no matter what may happen.\"    \"I promise. Go on--go on,\" said the young man feverishly.    Janet Gordon locked her hands together in her lap, like a woman who  nerves herself to some hateful task. She looked very old; the lines on  her face seemed doubly deep and harsh.    \"My sister Margaret was a very proud, high-spirited girl, Master. But I  would not have you think she was unlovable. No, no, that would be doing  a great injustice to her memory. She had her faults as we all have; but  she was bright and merry and warm-hearted. We all loved her. She was the  light and life of this house. Yes, Master, before the trouble that came  on her Margaret was a winsome lass, singing like a lark from morning  till night. Maybe we spoiled her a little--maybe we gave her too much of  her own way.    \"Well, Master, you have heard the story of her marriage to Ronald Fraser  and what came after, so I need not go into that. I know, or used to know  Elizabeth Williamson well, and I know that"]]]
