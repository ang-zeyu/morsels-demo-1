These are, in the first place, intercourse with citizens, who  frequently visit and entrust their children to the people of the Black  tents ; and, secondly, the social position of the women.    The Rev. Charles Robertson, author of a certain    [p.90] Lecture on Poetry, addressed to Working Men, asserts that Passion  became Love under the influence of Christianity, and that the idea of a  Virgin Mother spread over the sex a sanctity unknown to the poetry or  to the philosophy of Greece and Rome.[FN#21] Passing over the  objections of deified Eros and Immortal Psyche, and of the Virgin  Mothersymbol of moral puritybeing common to every old and material  faith,[FN#22] I believe that all the noble tribes of savages display  the principle. Thus we might expect to find, wherever the fancy, the  imagination, and the ideality are strong, some traces of a sentiment  innate in the human organisation. It exists, says Mr. Catlin, amongst  the North American Indians, and even the Gallas and the Somal of Africa  are not wholly destitute of it. But when the barbarian becomes a  semi-barbarian, as are the most polished Orientals, or as were the  classical authors of Greece and Rome, then women fall from their proper  place in society, become mere articles of luxury, and sink into the  lowest moral condition. In the next stage, civilisation, they rise again  to be highly accomplished, and not a little frivolous.    [p.91]Miss Martineau, when travelling through Egypt, once visited a  harim, and there found, among many things, especially in ignorance of  books and of book-making, materials for a heart-broken wail over the  degradation of her sex. The learned lady indulges, too, in sundry  strong and unsavoury comparisons between the harim and certain haunts  of vice in Europe. On the other hand, male travellers generally speak  lovingly of the harim. Sonnini, no admirer of Egypt, expatiates on the  generous virtues, the examples of magnanimity and affectionate  attachment, the sentiments ardent, yet gentle, forming a delightful  unison with personal charms in the harims of the Mamluks.    As usual, the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes. Human  nature, all the world over, differs but in degree. Everywhere women may  be capricious, coy, and hard to please in common conjunctures: in the  hour of need they will display devoted heroism. Any chronicler of the  Afghan war will bear witness that warm hearts, noble sentiments, and an  overflowing kindness to the poor, the weak, and the unhappy are found  even in a harim. Europe now knows that the Moslem husband provides  separate apartments and a distinct establishment for each of his wives,  unless, as sometimes happens, one be an old woman and the other a  child. And, confessing that envy, hatred, and malice often flourish in  polygamy, the Moslem asks, Is monogamy open to no objections? As far as  my limited observations go, polyandry is the only state of society in  which jealousy and quarrels about the sex are the exception and not the  rule of life.    In quality of doctor I have seen a little and heard much of the harim.  It often resembles a European home composed of a man, his wife, and his  mother. And I have seen in the West many a happy fireside fitter to make  Miss Martineaus heart ache than any harim in Grand Cairo.    [p.92] Were it not evident that the spiritualising of sexuality by  sentiment, of propensity by imagination, is universal among the highest  orders of mankind,cest letoffe de la nature que limagination a brodee, says  Voltaire,I should attribute the origin of love to the influence of the  Arabs poetry and chivalry upon European ideas rather than to mediaeval  Christianity. Certain Fathers of the Church, it must be remembered, did  not believe that women have souls. The Moslems never went so far.    In nomad life, tribes often meet for a time, live together whilst  pasturage lasts, and then separate perhaps for a generation. Under such  circumstances, youths who hold with the Italian that    Perduto e tutto il tempo  Che in amor non si spende,    will lose heart to maidens, whom possibly, by the laws of the clan,  they may not marry,[FN#23] and the light o love will fly her home. The  fugitives must brave every danger, for revenge, at all times the Badawis  idol, now becomes the lodestar of his existence. But the Arab lover  will dare all consequences. Men have died and the worms have eaten them,  but not for love, may be true in the West: it is false in the East. This  is attested in every tale where love, and not ambition, is the  groundwork of the narrative.[FN#24] And nothing can be more tender, more    [p.93] pathetic than the use made of these separations and long  absences by the old Arab poets. Whoever peruses the Suspended Poem of  Labid, will find thoughts at once so plaintive and so noble, that even  Dr. Carlyles learned verse cannot wholly deface their charm.    The warrior-bard returns from afar. He looks upon the traces of hearth  and home still furrowing the Desert ground. In bitterness of spirit he  checks himself from calling aloud upon his lovers and his friends. He  melts at the remembrance of their departure, and long indulges in the  absorbing theme. Then he strengthens himself by the thought of Nawaras  inconstancy, how she left him and never thought of him again. He  impatiently dwells upon the charms of the places which detain her,  advocates flight from the changing lover and the false friend, and, in  the exultation with which he feels his swift dromedary start under him  upon her rapid course, he seems to seek and finds some consolation for  womens perfidy and forgetfulness. Yet he cannot abandon Nawaras name or  memory. Again he dwells with yearning upon scenes of past felicity, and  he boasts of his prowessa fresh reproach to her,of his gentle birth, and  of his hospitality. He ends with an encomium upon his clan, to which he  attributes, as a noble Arab should, all the virtues of man. This is  Goldsmiths deserted village in Al-Hijaz. But the Arab, with equal  simplicity and pathos, has a fire, a force of language, and a depth of  feeling, which the Irishman, admirable as his verse is, could never  rival.    As the author of the Peninsular War well remarks, women in troubled  times, throwing off their accustomed feebleness and frivolity, become  helpmates meet for man. The same is true of pastoral life. [FN#25]  Here, between the      [p.94] extremes of fierceness and sensibility, the weaker sex,  remedying its great want, power, rises itself by courage, physical as  well as moral. In the early days of Al-Islam, if history be credible,  Arabia had a race of heroines. Within the last century, Ghaliyah, the  wife of a Wahhabi chief, opposed Mohammed Ali himself in many a bloody  field. A few years ago, when Ibn Asm, popularly called Ibn Rumi, chief  of the Zubayd clan about Rabigh, was treacherously slain by the Turkish  general, Kurdi Osman, his sister, a fair young girl, determined to  revenge him. She fixed upon the Arafat-day of pilgrimage for the  accomplishment of her designs, disguised herself in male attire, drew  her kerchief in the form Lisam over the lower part of her face, and  with lighted match awaited her enemy. The Turk, however, was not  present, and the girl was arrested to win for herself a local  reputation equal to the maid of Salamanca. Thus it is that the Arab has  learned to swear that great oath by the honour of my women.    The Badawin are not without a certain Platonic affection, which they  call Hawa (or Ishk) uzripardonable love.[FN#26] They draw the fine line  between amant and amoureux: this is derided by the tow[n]speople,  little suspecting how much such a custom says in favour of the wild  men. Arabs, like other Orientals, hold that, in such matters, man is  saved, not by faith, but by want of faith. They have also a saying not  unlike ours    She partly is to blame who has been tried;  He comes too near who comes to be denied.    [p.95]The evil of this system is that they, like certain  Southernspensano sempre al malealways suspect, which may be worldly-wise,  and also always show their suspicions, which is assuredly foolish. For  thus they demoralise their women, who might be kept in the way of right  by self-respect and by a sense of duty.    From ancient periods of the Arabs history we find him practising  knight-errantry, the wildest form of chivalry.[FN#27] The Songs of Antar,  says the author of the Crescent and the Cross, show little of the true  chivalric spirit. What thinks the reader of sentiments like  these[FN#28]? This valiant man, remarks Antar (who was ever interested for  the weaker sex,) hath defended the honour of women. We read in another  place, Mercy, my lord, is the noblest quality of the noble. Again, it is  the most ignominious of deeds to take free-born women prisoners. Bear not  malice, O Shibub, quoth the hero, for of malice good never came. Is there  no true greatness in this sentiment?Birth is the boast of the faineant;  noble is the youth who beareth every ill, who clotheth himself in mail  during the noontide heat, and who wandereth through the outer darkness  of night. And why does the knight of knights love Ibla? Because she is  blooming as the sun at dawn, with hair black as the midnight shades,  with Paradise in her eye, her bosom an enchantment, and a form waving  like the tamarisk when the soft wind blows from the hills of Nijd? Yes!  but his chest expands also with the thoughts of her faith, purity, and  affection,it is her moral as well as her material excellence that makes  her  [p.96] the heros hope, and hearing, and sight. Briefly, in Antar I discern    a love exalted high,  By all the glow of chivalry;    and I lament to see so many intelligent travellers misjudging the Arab  after a superficial experience of a few debased Syrians or Sinaites.  The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#18)"],[1,"had not the Divine essence  for its object, the Word so conceived would be a creature instead of  God; which is false. But in the way described He is \"God of God.\"  Again, this looking back upon the Divine essence, which takes place  in the mind of God, must, in a manner, produce a natural likeness;  else the Word would not be the Son of God. So here we have the unity  of essence in the diversity of Persons; and a clear proof of this  distinction may be found in the word of that soaring eagle St John:  \"The Word was in the beginning with God.\"    Thus the Father is the Fountain-head of the Son, and the Son is the  outflowing of the Father; and the Father and Son pour forth the  Spirit; and the Unity, which is the essence of the Fountain-head, is  also the substance of the three Persons. But as to how the Three are  One, this cannot be expressed in words, on account of the simplicity  of that Abyss. Into this intellectual Where, the spirits of men made  perfect soar and plunge themselves, now flying over infinite  heights, now swimming in unfathomed depths, marvelling at the high  and wonderful mysteries of the Godhead. Nevertheless, the spirit  remains a spirit, and retains its nature, while it enjoys the vision  of the Divine Persons, and abstracted from all occupation with  things below contemplates with fixed gaze those stupendous  mysteries. For what can be more marvellous than that simple Unity,  into which the Trinity of the Persons merges itself, and in which  all multiplicity ceases? For the outflowing of the Persons is always  tending back into the Unity of the same essence, and all creatures,  according to their ideal existence in God, are from eternity in this  Unity, and have their life, knowledge, and essence in the eternal  God; as it is said in the Gospel: \"That which was made, was Life in  Him.\"[42] This bare Unity is a dark silence and tranquil inactivity,  which none can understand unless he is illuminated by the Unity  itself, unmixed with any evil. Out of this shines forth hidden  truth, free from all falsehood; and this truth is born from the  unveiling of the veiled Divine purity; for after the revelation of  these things, the spirit is at last unclothed of the dusky light  which up till now has followed it, and in which it has hitherto seen  things in an earthly way. Indeed, the spirit finds itself now  changed and something very different from what it supposed itself to  be according to its earlier light: even as St Paul says, \"I, yet not  I.\" Thus it is unclothed and simplified in the simplicity of the  Divine essence, which shines upon all things in simple stillness. In  this modeless mode of contemplation, the permanent distinction of  the Persons, viewed as separate, is lost. For, as some teach, it is  not the Person of the Father, taken by Himself, which produces  bliss, nor the Person of the Son, taken by Himself, nor the Person  of the Holy Ghost, taken by Himself; but the three Persons, dwelling  together in the unity of the essence, confer bliss. And this is the  natural essence of the Persons, which by grace gives the substance  or essence to all their creatures, and it contains in itself the  ideas of all things in their simple essence. Now since this ideal  light subsists as Being, so all things subsist in it according to  their essential being, not according to their accidental forms; and  since it shines upon all things, its property is to subsist as  light. Hence all things shine forth in this essence in interior  stillness, without altering its simplicity.    Then the maiden said: I could wish greatly, sir, that you could give  me this mysterious teaching, as you understand it, under a figure,  that I might understand it better. I should also be glad if you  could sum up what you have been saying at length, so that it may  stick more firmly in my weak mind. The servitor replied: Who can  express in forms what has no form? Who can explain that which has no  mode of being, and is above sense and reason? Any similitude must be  infinitely more unlike than like the reality. Nevertheless, that I  may drive out forms from your mind by forms, I will try to give you  a picture of these ideas which surpass all forms, and to sum up a  long discourse in a few words. A certain wise theologian says that  God, in regard to His Godhead, is like a vast circle, of which the  centre is everywhere, and the circumference nowhere. Now consider  the image which follows. If anyone throws a great stone into the  middle of a pool, a ring is formed in the water, and this ring makes  a second ring, and the second a third; and the number and size of  the rings depend on the force of the throw. They may even require a  larger space than the limit of the pool. Suppose now that the first  ring represents the omnipotent virtue of the Divine nature, which is  infinite in God the Father. This produces another ring like itself,  which is the Son. And the two produce the third, which is the Holy  Ghost. The spiritual superessential begetting of the Divine Word is  the cause of the creation of all spirits and all things. This  supreme Spirit has so ennobled man, as to shed upon him a ray from  His own eternal Godhead. This is the image of God in the mind, which  is itself eternal. But many men turn away from this dignity of their  nature, befouling the bright image of God in themselves, and turning  to the bodily pleasures of this world. They pursue them greedily and  devote themselves to them, till death unexpectedly stops them. But  he who is wise, turns himself and elevates himself, with the help of  the Divine spark in his soul, to that which is stable and eternal,  whence he had his own origin: he says farewell to all the fleeting  creatures, and clings to the eternal truth alone.    Attend also to what I say about the order in which the spirit ought  to return to God. First of all, we should disentangle ourselves  absolutely from the pleasures of the world, manfully turning our  backs upon all vices; we should turn to God by continual prayers, by  seclusion, and holy exercise, that the flesh may thus be subdued to  the spirit. Next, we must offer ourselves willingly to endure all  the troubles which may come upon us, from God, or from the  creatures. Thirdly, we must impress upon ourselves the Passion of  Christ crucified; we must fix upon our minds His sweet teaching, His  most gentle conversation, His most pure life, which He gave us for  our example, and so we must penetrate deeper and advance further in  our imitation of Him. Fourthly, we must divest ourselves of external  occupations, and establish ourselves in a tranquil stillness of soul  by an energetic resignation, as if we were dead to self, and thought  only of the honour of Christ and His heavenly Father. Lastly, we  should be humble towards all men, whether friends or foes. . . . But  all these images, with their interpretations, are as unlike the  formless truth as a black Ethiopian is to the bright sun.    Soon after this holy maiden died, and passed away happy from earth,  even as her whole life had been conspicuous only for her virtues.  After her death she appeared to her spiritual father in a vision.  She was clothed in raiment whiter than snow; she shone with dazzling  brightness, and was full of heavenly joy. She came near to him, and  showed him in what an excellent fashion she had passed away into the  simple Godhead. He saw and heard her with exceeding delight, and the  vision filled his soul with heavenly consolations. When he returned  to himself, he sighed most deeply, and thus pondered: O Almighty  God, how blessed is he, who strives after Thee alone! He may well be  content to bear affliction, whose sufferings Thou wilt thus reward!  May the Almighty God grant that we likewise may be brought to the  same joys as this blessed maiden!    A MEDITATION ON THE PASSION OF CHRIST    THEN said the Eternal Wisdom to the servitor, Attend and listen  dutifully, while I tell thee what sufferings I lovingly endured for  thy sake.    After I had finished My last Supper with My disciples, when I had  offered Myself to My enemies on the mount, and had resigned Myself  to bear a terrible death, and knew that it was approaching very  near, so great was the oppression of My tender heart and all My  body, that I sweated blood; then I was wickedly arrested, bound, and  carried away. On the same night they treated Me with insult and  contumely, beating Me, spitting upon Me, and covering My head.  Before Caiaphas was I unjustly accused and condemned to death. What  misery it was to see My mother seized with unspeakable sorrow of  heart, from the time when she beheld Me threatened with such great  dangers, till the time when I was hung upon the cross. They brought  Me before Pilate with every kind of ignominy, they accused Me  falsely, they adjudged Me worthy of death. Before Herod I, the  Eternal Wisdom, was mocked in a bright robe. My fair body was  miserably torn and rent by cruel scourgings. They surrounded My  sacred head with a crown of thorns; My gracious face was covered  with blood and spittings. When they had thus condemned Me to death,  they led Me out with My cross to bear the last shameful punishment.  Their terrible and savage cries could be heard afar off: \"Crucify,  crucify, the wicked man.\"    Servitor. Alas, Lord, if so bitter were the beginnings of Thy  passion, what will be the end thereof? In truth, if I saw a brute  beast so treated in my presence I could hardly bear it. What grief  then should I feel in heart and soul at Thy Passion? And yet there  is one thing at which I marvel greatly. For I long, O my most dear  God, to know only Thy Godhead; and Thou tellest me of Thy humanity.  I long to taste Thy sweetness, and Thou showest me Thy bitterness.  What meaneth this, O my Lord God?    Wisdom. No man can come to the height of My Godhead, nor attain to  that unknown sweetness, unless he be first led through the"]]]
