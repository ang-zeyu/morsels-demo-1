Wheeler meanwhile had moved up his  camp from Kyetrak to a spot on the moraine East of the glacier and  intended to spend a week or fortnight in that valley.    The next morning Heron and I started to go over the Pusi Pass (Marmot  Pass), so called because of the number of marmots that frequent the  Southern slopes. After fording the Kyetrak River, we climbed up the  moraine to the West of the Kyetrak Glacier and then turned up some easy  grass hills until we came to the top of the pass, 17,700 feet.  Here at the very top were growing some delightful little dwarf  forget-me-nots--not an inch high--also many white and yellow saxifrages.  Most of the views were unfortunately hidden by clouds, though one fine  triple-headed peak showed up well to the South. We passed several flocks  of female burhel (_Ovis nahura_), which were quite tame, and allowed us  to ride up to within 50 yards of them. The hillsides were bare at first  and grassy and the air felt distinctly cold and damp. We now commenced  our long descent, and at 16,000 feet began to meet with juniper bushes  and many dwarf rhododendrons. As we got lower, many more varieties of  bushes appeared. There were two or three kinds of berberis, loniceras,  white and pink spiraeas, and quantities of white roses; besides these  were masses of primulas and anemones, and pink, white or mauve  geraniums. We now followed the right bank of the Shung-chu, a great  glacial torrent, which joined by several others became an unfordable  stream. The path was well engineered, sometimes close to the river, and  sometimes built out on rocks high above the stream. All of a sudden the  valley narrowed into a great gorge. We had left all the granites and  slates behind and had suddenly come into the zone of the gneiss, which  extended many miles to the South. A little way further down, at a place  where two other valleys meet, we caught sight of some green barley  fields lying round the small village of Tasang where we encamped on a  terrace for the night. We were now at a height of only 13,300 feet, and  were able to get fresh eggs and vegetables again. It was a great  pleasure once more to have wood fires in place of the yak dung with its  acrid smoke, which caused all one's food to taste unpleasantly. Here we  used as fuel the aromatic wood of the juniper.    This valley is looked upon as a holy one, owing to the number of juniper  bushes that grow in it, and several hermits and nuns had taken up their  abode in it and shut themselves up in caves in order to meditate. The  nearest village used to supply them with food, and morning and evening  could be seen ascending the blue smoke of the juniper, which they burnt  as incense before the entrances of their dwelling places. There was a  hermit who lived close to the village and whose cave we could see high  up in the rocks above. The villagers told us that after meditating for a  period of ten years, he would be able to live on only ten grains of  barley a day, and they were looking forward to that day. There was  another anchorite female who was supposed to have lived here for 138  years and who was greatly revered. She had forbidden any of the animals  in the valley to be killed, and that was the reason why the flocks of  burhel we had passed were so extremely tame. The next day, giving our  transport a rest, Heron and I walked for 7 or 8 miles down the valley.  On the opposite side of the valley the only trees were birches and  willow, and it was curious that, at these comparatively low heights,  there were no large rhododendrons or fir trees. On the other side of the  valley, the vegetation consisted wholly of juniper, berberis or wild  roses. We descended to 12,000 feet, most of the time going through  narrow gorges. At one place we came across a number of gooseberry bushes  covered with young gooseberries, of which we gathered a sufficient  supply to last us for several days. The rose bushes were charming all  the way. At first they were all of the white creamy coloured variety,  but lower down we came on the big red one with flowers often more than 3  inches in diameter. Wherever there were springs of water there grew  masses of anemones and yellow primulas. We now returned to our camp at  Tasang, and rain then started and continued the remainder of the day.  The people told us that this valley was passable for animals for three  days' journey, after which the river entered into some terrible gorges  down which it was only just possible for a coolie to get along, and  these latter gorges formed the boundary between Tibet and Nepal. On  July 1 we started to return to Kyetrak; the morning was misty when we  started, and though the higher peaks were all hidden in the clouds, the  sun shone brightly and the day was quite hot. Our kit did not arrive  till between five and six o'clock, and the yaks had a great deal of  trouble in getting across the Kyetrak River, as it had risen  considerably. Wheeler was still at his high camp further up the valley,  waiting for a really clear day. The clouds, too, were his great enemies,  as they came up very early every morning from over the Khombu Pass.    From here Heron and I had decided to go on and see how Mallory and  Bullock had been faring in the next valley, so the next morning, after  breakfasting at 5 a.m., we started off. It was one of the coldest  mornings we had had, with a very hard frost, and being on the shady side  of the valley we did not get the sun till several hours after we had  started. After going down the valley for about 6 miles, we turned off to  the East and crossed several easy passes, the higher of them, the Lamna  La, being 16,900 feet. The country was very barren of flowers and  vegetation, but there was a certain amount of grazing for yaks and  sheep. The march to Zambu was a fairly long one of 20 miles, but the  yaks came along well. This was a more prosperous-looking village than  most of them, and the houses were all whitewashed. We were still too  high for barley fields as we were just 16,000 feet, but the wealth of  the village lay in its herds of yaks and sheep; the villagers told us  they owned 3,000 yaks. Shepherds in this country are but poorly paid,  getting only thirty trangkas (10_s._) per annum. But house servants are  still worse off, getting only eight trangkas (2_s._ 8_d._) per annum.  However, they seem to thrive under those wages and there is no  discontent or trades unionism among them. Our camp was pitched in a  sunny spot not far from the village, looking straight over towards Mount  Everest, whose top appeared over the opposite hills. From this side its  precipices looked most formidable and there was also a magnificent ridge  which we had not seen before. There was a slight frost again that night.    Breakfasting, as usual, at 5 a.m., I started up the hill South of the  camp and was lucky enough to get a clear view of Everest and the Rongbuk  Valley that led up to it. This valley ran right up to the foot of Mount  Everest and seemed an easy enough approach, but the mountain itself  looked absolutely unscalable from this side, showing nothing but a  series of very steep precipices. The day turned out to be a very hot  one. I descended into the valley below, and started to ride up towards  Mount Everest. Presently I came to an unfordable stream, and after  making several attempts to get across this, found myself compelled to  return several miles down the valley to the monastery of Choebu, where  there was a slender footbridge. The pony that I was riding was swum  across, a rope being attached to its head. He was then pulled over to  the far side, a proceeding he did not at all enjoy. The yaks, too, were  unladen, and the loads carried by hand over the bridge. After this the  yaks were driven into the river and made to swim across, but they only  went as far as an island in the middle of the river. From this place  they would not budge in spite of stones, curses and threats, until at  length a man with a sling, fetched from the monastery, hurled stones at  them with great violence: this procedure apparently so stung them up  that they thought it advisable to cross the remainder of the stream. At  the entrance to the valley, we passed some very tame burhel within a few  yards of the path, and then went along at the foot of some fine cliffs  with limestone on the top and layers of hornblende and granite below.  At first there was quite a rich vegetation growing here, considering we  were just on 16,000 feet. There were juniper bushes, clematis, willows,  a genista, rock roses, and even some yellow primulas, but as we got  further into the valley it became more stony, and on either side of the  path were small piles of stones heaped up by pilgrims. The valley was  considered very sacred and was apparently a great place of pilgrimage.  We found the base camp of the Alpine climbers pitched close to the  Rongbuk Monastery, where there lived a very high re-incarnated Lama who  was in meditation and not allowed to see anyone. This valley was called  the Rongbuk, or inner valley--a name well suited to it; the legend was  that from this valley there used to be a pass over into the Khombu  Valley, but the high Lama who lived here forbade the use of it, as it  disturbed the meditations of the recluses and hermits, of which there  were several hundred here. At first these good people did not at all  approve of our coming into this valley, as they thought we should be  likely to disturb and distract their meditations.    The Rongbuk Monastery lies at a height of 16,500 feet, and is an  unpleasantly cold spot. This monastery contains twenty permanent Lamas  who always live there, together with the re-incarnated Lama. Besides  these, there are three hundred other associated Lamas who come in  periodically, remaining there for periods of varying length. These  Associate Lamas are mostly well-to-do, and having sufficient money to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#18)"],[1,"ck, Frapp, and Jervais; the new company retaining the  same name and style as the old.    The old partners left for St. Louis, with a company of seventy men, to  convoy the furs. Two of them never returned to the Rocky Mountains; one  of them, Smith, being killed the following year, as will hereafter be  related; and Jackson remaining in St. Louis, where, like a true  mountain-man, he dissipated his large and hard-earned fortune in a few  years. Captain Sublette, however, continued to make his annual trips to  and from the mountains for a number of years; and until the  consolidation of another wealthy company with the Rocky Mountain  Company, continued to furnish goods to the latter, at a profit on St.  Louis prices; his capital and experience enabling him to keep the new  firm under his control to a large degree.          CHAPTER V.      1830. The whole country lying upon the Yellowstone and its tributaries,  and about the head-waters of the Missouri, at the time of which we are  writing, abounded not only in beaver, but in buffalo, bear, elk,  antelope, and many smaller kinds of game. Indeed the buffalo used then  to cross the mountains into the valleys about the head-waters of the  Snake and Colorado Rivers, in such numbers that at certain seasons of  the year, the plains and river bottoms swarmed with them. Since that day  they have quite disappeared from the western slope of the Rocky  Mountains, and are no longer seen in the same numbers on the eastern  side.    Bear, although they did not go in herds, were rather uncomfortably  numerous, and sometimes put the trapper to considerable trouble, and  fright also; for very few were brave enough to willingly encounter the  formidable grizzly, one blow of whose terrible paw, aimed generally at  the hunter's head, if not arrested, lays him senseless and torn, an easy  victim to the wrathful monster. A gunshot wound, if not directed with  certainty to some vulnerable point, has only the effect to infuriate the  beast, and make him trebly dangerous. From the fact that the bear always  bites his wound, and commences to run with his head thus brought in the  direction from which the ball comes, he is pretty likely to make a  straight wake towards his enemy, whether voluntarily or not; and woe be  to the hunter who is not prepared for him, with a shot for his eye,  or the spot just behind the ear, where certain death enters.    [Illustration: _THE THREE \"BARES.\"_]    In the frequent encounters of the mountain-men with these huge beasts,  many acts of wonderful bravery were performed, while some tragedies, and  not a few comedies were enacted.    From something humorous in Joe Meek's organization, or some wonderful  \"luck\" to which he was born, or both, the greater part of his adventures  with bears, as with men, were of a humorous complexion; enabling him not  only to have a story to tell, but one at which his companions were bound  to laugh. One of these which happened during the fall hunt of 1830, we  will let him tell for himself:    \"The first fall on the Yellowstone, Hawkins and myself were coming up  the river in search of camp, when we discovered a very large bar on the  opposite bank. We shot across, and thought we had killed him, fur he  laid quite still. As we wanted to take some trophy of our victory to  camp, we tied our mules and left our guns, clothes, and everything  except our knives and belts, and swum over to whar the bar war. But  instead of being dead, as we expected, he sprung up as we come near him,  and took after us. Then you ought to have seen two naked men run! It war  a race for life, and a close one, too. But we made the river first. The  bank war about fifteen feet high above the water, and the river ten or  twelve feet deep; but we didn't halt. Overboard we went, the bar after  us, and in the stream about as quick as we war. The current war very  strong, and the bar war about half way between Hawkins and me. Hawkins  was trying to swim down stream faster than the current war carrying the  bar, and I war a trying to hold back. You can reckon that I swam! Every  moment I felt myself being washed into the yawning jaws of the mighty  beast, whose head war up the stream, and his eyes on me. But the  current war too strong for him, and swept him along as fast as it did  me. All this time, not a long one, we war looking for some place to land  where the bar could not overtake us. Hawkins war the first to make the  shore, unknown to the bar, whose head war still up stream; and he set up  such a whooping and yelling that the bar landed too, but on the opposite  side. I made haste to follow Hawkins, who had landed on the side of the  river we started from, either by design or good luck: and then we  traveled back a mile and more to whar our mules war left--a bar on one  side of the river, and _two bares_ on the other!\"    Notwithstanding that a necessary discipline was observed and maintained  in the fur traders' camp, there was at the same time a freedom of manner  between the Booshways and the men, both hired and free, which could not  obtain in a purely military organization, nor even in the higher walks  of civilized life in cities. In the mountain community, motley as it  was, as in other communities more refined, were some men who enjoyed  almost unlimited freedom of speech and action, and others who were the  butt of everybody's ridicule or censure. The leaders themselves did not  escape the critical judgment of the men; and the estimation in which  they were held could be inferred from the manner in which they  designated them. Captain Sublette, whose energy, courage, and kindness  entitled him to the admiration of the mountaineers, went by the name of  _Billy_: his partner Jackson, was called _Davey_; Bridger, _old Gabe_,  and so on. In the same manner the men distinguished favorites or  oddities amongst themselves, and to have the adjective _old_ prefixed to  a man's name signified nothing concerning his age, but rather that he  was an object of distinction; though it did not always indicate, except  by the tone in which it was pronounced, whether that distinction were an  enviable one or not.    Whenever a trapper could get hold of any sort of story reflecting on the  courage of a leader, he was sure at some time to make him aware of it,  and these anecdotes were sometimes sharp answers in the mouths of  careless camp-keepers. Bridger was once waylaid by Blackfeet, who shot  at him, hitting his horse in several places. The wounds caused the  animal to rear and pitch, by reason of which violent movements Bridger  dropped his gun, and the Indians snatched it up; after which there was  nothing to do except to run, which Bridger accordingly did. Not long  after this, as was customary, the leader was making a circuit of the  camp examining the camp-keeper's guns, to see if they were in order, and  found that of one Maloney, an Irishman, in a very dirty condition.    \"What would you do,\" asked Bridger, \"with a gun like that, if the  Indians were to charge on the camp?\"    \"Be ----, I would throw it to them, and run the way ye did,\" answered  Maloney, quickly. It was sometime after this incident before Bridger  again examined Maloney's gun.    A laughable story in this way went the rounds of the camp in this fall  of 1830. Milton Sublette was out on a hunt with Meek after buffalo, and  they were just approaching the band on foot, at a distance apart of  about fifty yards, when a large grizzly bear came out of a thicket and  made after Sublette, who, when he perceived the creature, ran for the  nearest cotton-wood tree. Meek in the meantime, seeing that Sublette was  not likely to escape, had taken sure aim, and fired at the bear,  fortunately killing him. On running up to the spot where it laid,  Sublette was discovered sitting at the foot of a cotton-wood, with his  legs and arms clasped tightly around it.    \"Do you always climb a tree in that way?\" asked Meek.    \"I reckon you took the wrong end of it, that time, Milton!\"    \"I'll be ----, Meek, if I didn't think I was twenty feet up that tree  when you shot;\" answered the frightened Booshway; and from that time the  men never tired of alluding to Milton's manner of climbing a tree.    [Illustration: THE WRONG END OF THE TREE.]    These were some of the mirthful incidents which gave occasion for a  gayety which had to be substituted for happiness, in the checkered life  of the trapper; and there were like to be many such, where there were  two hundred men, each almost daily in the way of adventures by flood or  field.    On the change in the management of the Company which occurred at the  rendezvous this year, three of the new partners, Fitzpatrick, Sublette,  and Bridger, conducted a large party, numbering over two hundred, from  the Wind River to the Yellowstone; crossing thence to Smith's River, the  Falls of the Missouri, three forks of the Missouri, and to the Big  Blackfoot River. The hunt proved very successful; beaver were plentiful;  and the Blackfeet shy of so large a traveling party. Although so long in  their country, there were only four men killed out of the whole company  during this autumn.    From the Blackfoot River the company proceeded down the west side of the  mountains to the forks of the Snake River, and after trapping for a  short time in this locality, continued their march southward as far as  Ogden's Hole, a small valley among the Bear River Mountains.    At this place they fell in with a trading and trapping party, under Mr.  Peter Skeen Ogden, of the Hudson's Bay Company. And now commenced that  irritating and reprehensible style of rivalry with which the different  companies were accustomed to annoy one another. Accompanying Mr. Ogden's  trading party were a party of Rockway Indians, who were from the North,  and who were employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, as the Iroquois and  Crows were, to trap for them. Fitzpatrick and associates camped in the"]]]
