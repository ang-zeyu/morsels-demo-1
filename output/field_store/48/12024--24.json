And that disc is one that never fails to charm the attentive student, for  it abounds in colour, movement and change. The late Prof. James Keeler, an  observer of the first rank, having the advantage of observing the planet  from the summit of Mt. Hamilton and with the great 36-inch telescope of  the Lick Observatory, thus describes the aspect of the planet in 1889.        \"Seen with this instrument on a fine night, the disc of Jupiter was a      most beautiful object, covered with a wealth of detail which could not      possibly be accurately represented in a drawing.... Scarcely any      portion of Jupiter, except the Red Spot and the extreme polar regions,      was of a uniform tint, the surface being mottled with flocculent and      more or less irregular cloud masses.... The equatorial zone, occupying      the space between the red belts, was marked in the centre by a      salmon-coloured stripe, which was occasionally interrupted by an      extension of the white clouds on the sides of the zone. The edges were      brilliant white, and were formed of rounded cloud-like masses, which      at certain places extended into the red belts as long streamers....      Near their junction with the equatorial zone, the streamers were white      and definite in outline, but they became redder in tint toward their      outer extremities, and more diffuse, until they were lost in the      general red colour of the background. When the seeing was good they      were seen to be formed of irregular rounded or feathery clouds, fading      toward the outer ends, until the structure could no longer be      distinguished.... The portions of the equatorial zone surrounding the      roots of well-marked streamers were somewhat brighter than at other      places, and it is a curious circumstance that they were almost      invariably suffused with a pale olive-green colour, which seemed to be      associated with great disturbance, and which was rarely seen      elsewhere.... The red belts presented on all occasions the appearance      of a passive medium, in which the phenomena of the streamers and other      forms ... were manifested. The phenomena would be exactly reproduced      by streamers of cloudy white matter floating in a semi-transparent      reddish fluid, sometimes submerged and sometimes rising to the      surface.... The dark spots frequently seen on the red belts usually      occupied spaces left by sharp turns in the streamers, and they were of      the same colour as the belts, but deeper in tint, as if the fluid      medium could be seen to a greater depth.\"[15]    In other words, Jupiter is a striped or banded planet, the bands lying  along the direction of turning. These bands are coloured in varying tints,  and the planet rotates very rapidly, for the details in the bands pass  quickly from one limb to the other. And not only is the speed of rotation  of the whole very rapid--Jupiter turns about its axis in a little less  than ten hours, so that a particle at its equator moves through 466 miles  in each minute--but the various items that form the bands rotate in  different times. They may also alter their form and their colour. Jupiter  seems, then, to be a planet with a great and rapidly changing atmosphere  that extends above a shoreless sea formed of some liquified substance or  substances--the whole in a state of flux.    But if we turn back to the Table, we see that Jupiter at its mean distance  from the Sun is 5.2 times that of the Earth; that is to say, it receives  only 1/27th of the light and heat that we receive. But in Chapter VIII, we  learnt from Mars that as this receives only 3/7ths of the Earth's light  and heat, its mean temperature would sink to -30 deg.C.; the Earth's being  16 deg.C. Mars is therefore almost always a frozen planet; frozen except on  its mere surface when this is exposed to the full rays of the Sun. No sea  there would ever be melted to a depth of more than a few inches, even at  noonday in midsummer. And yet Mars has at least ten times the advantages  of Jupiter. Jupiter, then, must be a frozen planet through and through; no  liquid of any sort can exist on its surface; no vapour of any substance  can exist in its atmosphere. It must be icebound even at its summer  noonday.    Yet, from the description given by Prof. Keeler, it is manifestly not so;  and another item in the Table emphasizes that it cannot be so. The density  of the Sun is 1.4 that of water, Jupiter's is 1.33, showing that but a  very small proportion (if any) of its bulk can be solid; the rest must be  vaporous, or at least fluid. How then can we reconcile these  inconsistencies?    It is in the dimensions of Jupiter that we find the answer. The mass of  the planet is 317 times that of the Earth; it is indeed nearly three times  as great as that of all the other planets put together. But the  aggregation of so vast an amount of material is of itself a source of  heat; the chief source at the present time of the enormous output of heat  from the Sun is ascribed to its gradual contraction; the slow falling of  its substance, if we may so express it, a little nearer to its centre. The  great mass of Jupiter points to its inherent store of heat being much  greater than that of any other planet. And of two bodies equally hot, the  larger must cool more slowly than the smaller. If, therefore, all the  members of the solar system had at one and the same moment possessed the  same surface temperature, that equality would have ceased directly they  began to radiate their heat into space; the temperature of the smaller  bodies falling more rapidly than those of the larger. This is another  example of the principle that has already been noted, that the properties  of a small world are not those of a large world divided by a constant  factor. It is not possible to conceive a model of the solar system in  which all the significant factors should be true to the same scale. If the  diameters and distances were all made on a one-tenth scale, the surfaces  would be one-hundredth of reality, the volumes one-thousandth.    But a radiating body radiates from its surface, while the store of heat  from which that radiation is kept up is supplied by its volume. It  follows, therefore, that a large and heavy world must differ from a small  light world, not merely in scale, but also in kind.    The surface of a world is all that we see of it; it is, therefore, very  commonly all that we consider. But unseen, and hence often unconsidered,  beneath the surface lies its substance or mass, and it is this that  determines the state and condition of the surface; it is the underlying  power. Two men may be contending in a financial struggle; to the eye they  may look alike, equally prosperous; both may have the same amount of money  actually in their pockets; but the one has nothing else, the other has a  great banking account and vast investments, and is, in fact, a  millionaire; and it is his unseen power and resources that will make  themselves felt.    Jupiter therefore introduces us to a new factor in world-condition; not  all its heat is derived from the Sun; much is inherent to it. And though  it is not possible at present to say that the mass of Jupiter being so  much its inherent heat must be this or that quantity as a function of that  mass, yet in general, and neglecting other considerations, we can say that  of two worlds the one with the greater mass will be that with the higher  inherent temperature. This factor of inherent temperature was one that did  not require to be noticed in dealing with the Moon, or Venus, or Mars, for  these and all the planets yet noticed are less in size, surface, volume,  and mass than the Earth, and hence possess less inherent heat. It is only  now that the greater planets are being considered that the question of a  source of heat, other than the Sun, can arise.    But the evidence of such heat on Jupiter is not to be disputed. The albedo  or reflective index of Jupiter has been put by the late Prof. G. Bond, of  Harvard College Observatory, as higher than unity; in other words, that it  emits more light than it receives. This is now generally regarded as an  excessive estimate, but the albedo of the disc as a whole cannot be put  lower than 0.72, or about that of white paper. But many of the \"belts\" or  dark regions are of a dull copper tint, and the polar caps are dusky, so  that Bond's estimate must be realized for the most brilliant \"zones,\" as  the brighter regions are called; certainly for the whitest of the white  spots.    No direct evidence of inherent luminosity has been obtained, for the  satellites disappear entirely in eclipse. But though their shadows in  transit appear very dark, it is clear that they are not absolutely black,  since sometimes such a shadow is not distinguishable in darkness from the  satellite that casts it; a delicate proof that the background on which it  falls has some intrinsic luminosity.    Unless there is the counteracting effect of a high temperature, the  atmosphere of Jupiter would have a pressure at the surface of 104 lb. to  the square inch, and the level of half pressure be attained at a mile and  a quarter; the reverse condition to that on Mars would obtain, and the  atmosphere of Jupiter would be much denser and much shallower than that of  the Earth. Denser it probably is; shallower it cannot be, for the great  white spots, each often five or six thousand miles in diameter, that range  themselves at times along the equatorial regions till they look like the  portholes of a ship, evidently rise from depths great even as compared  with their size. But it is only by intense heat that the effect of the  great mass of Jupiter in constricting its atmosphere within shallow depths  can be overcome.    Again, the extraordinary lightness of the planet, so little above the  density of water,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#18)"],[1,"beauty which I derive from the  same cause; for beauty in a virtuous woman is but like a distant  flame, or a sharp-edged sword, and only burns and wounds those who  approach too near it. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the soul,  and that body that is destitute of them cannot be esteemed beautiful,  though it be naturally so. If, then, honour be one of those endowments  which most adorn the body, why should she that is beloved for her  beauty expose herself to the loss of it, merely to gratify the  inclinations of one who, for his own selfish ends, uses all the means  imaginable to make her lose it? I was born free, and, that I might  continue so, I retired to these solitary hills and plains, where trees  are my companions, and clear fountains my looking-glasses. With the  trees and with the waters I communicate my thoughts and my beauty. I  am a distant flame, and a sword far off: those whom I have attracted  with my sight I have undeceived with my words; and if hope be the food  of desire, as I never gave any encouragement to Chrysostome, nor to  any other, it may well be said, it was rather his own obstinacy than  my cruelty that shortened his life. If you tell me that his intentions  were honest, and therefore ought to have been complied with, I answer,  that when, at the very place where his grave is making, he discovered  his passion, I told him I was resolved to live and die single, and  that the earth alone should reap the fruit of my reservedness and  enjoy the spoils of my beauty; and if, after all the admonitions I  gave him, he would persist in his obstinate pursuit, and sail against  the wind, what wonder is it he should perish in the waves of his  indiscretion? Had I ever encouraged him, or amused him with ambiguous  words, then I had been false; and had I gratified his wishes, I had  acted contrary to my better resolves: he persisted, though I had given  him a due caution, and he despaired without being hated. Now I leave  you to judge whether I ought to be blamed for his sufferings. If I  have deceived any one, let him complain; if I have broke my promise to  any one, let him despair; if I encourage any one, let him presume; if  I entertain any one, let him boast: but let no man call me cruel nor  murderer until I either deceive, break my promise, encourage, or  entertain him. Let him that calls me a tigress and a basilisk avoid me  as a dangerous thing; and let him that calls me ungrateful give over  serving me: I assure them I will never seek nor pursue them. Therefore  let none hereafter make it their business to disturb my ease, nor  strive to make me hazard among men the peace I now enjoy, which I am  persuaded is not to be found with them. I have wealth enough; I  neither love nor hate any one; the innocent conversation of the  neighbouring shepherdesses, with the care of my flocks, help me to  pass away my time, without either coquetting with this man, or  practising arts to ensnare that other. My thoughts are limited by  these mountains; and if they wander further, it is only to admire the  beauty of heaven, and thus by steps to raise my soul towards her  original dwelling.\"    As soon as she had said this, without waiting for any answer, she left  the place, and ran into the thickest of the adjoining wood, leaving  all that heard her charmed with her discretion, as well as her beauty.    However, so prevalent were the charms of the latter that some of the  company, who were desperately struck, could not forbear offering to  follow her, without being in the least deterred by the solemn  protestations which they had heard her make that very moment. But Don  Quixote perceiving their design, and believing he had now a fit  opportunity to exert his knight-errantry; \"Let no man,\" cried he, \"of  what quality or condition soever, presume to follow the fair Marcella,  under the penalty of incurring my displeasure. She has made it appear,  by undeniable reasons, that she was not guilty of Chrysostome's death;  and has positively declared her firm resolution never to condescend to  the desires of any of her admirers: for which reason, instead of being  importuned and persecuted, she ought to be esteemed and honoured by  all good men, as being one of the few women in the world who have  lived with such a virtuous reservedness.\"    Now, whether it were that Don Quixote's threats terrified them, or  that Ambrose's persuasion prevailed with them to stay and see their  friend interred, none of the shepherds left the place, till the grave  being made, and the papers burnt, the body was deposited in the bosom  of the earth, not without many tears from all the assistants. They  covered the grave with a great stone, and strewed upon it many flowers  and boughs; and every one having condoled a while with his friend  Ambrose, they took their leave of him, and departed. Vivaldo and his  companion did the like; as did also Don Quixote, who was not a person  to forget himself on such occasions; he likewise bid adieu to the kind  goatherds that had entertained him, and to the two travellers, who  desired him to go with them to Seville, assuring him there was no  place in the world more fertile in adventures, every street and every  corner there producing some. Don Quixote returned them thanks for  their kind information, but told them, \"he neither would nor ought to  go to Seville till he had cleared all those mountains of the thieves  and robbers which he heard very much infested all those parts.\"  Thereupon the travellers, being unwilling to divert him from so good a  design, took their leaves of him once more, and pursued their journey,  sufficiently supplied with matter to discourse on from the story of  Marcella and Chrysostome, and the follies of Don Quixote.    The knight and his squire continued their journey, and on quitting an  inn, which, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Sancho, the Don, as  usual, insisted was a castle, all the people in the yard, above twenty  in number, stood gazing at him; and, among the rest, the host's  daughter, while he on his part removed not his eyes from her, and ever  and anon sent forth a sigh, which seemed to proceed from the bottom of  his heart.    Being now both mounted, and at the door of the inn, he called to the  host, and, in a grave and solemn tone of voice, said to him: \"Many and  great are the favours, signor governor, which in this your castle I  have received, and I am bound to be grateful to you all the days of my  life. If I can make you some compensation by taking vengeance on any  proud miscreant who hath insulted you, know that the duty of my  profession is no other than to strengthen the weak, to revenge the  injured, and to chastise the perfidious. Consider, and if your memory  recall anything of this nature to recommend to me, you need only  declare it; for I promise you, by the order of knighthood I have  received, to procure you satisfaction and amends to your heart's  desire!\" The host answered with the same gravity: \"Sir knight, I have  no need of your worship's avenging any wrong for me; I know how to  take the proper revenge when any injury is done me: all I desire of  your worship is, to pay me for what you have had in the inn, as well  for the straw and barley for your two beasts as for your supper and  lodging.\" \"What! is this an inn?\" exclaimed Don Quixote. \"Ay, and a  very creditable one,\" answered the host. \"Hitherto, then, I have been  in an error,\" answered Don Quixote; \"for in truth I took it for a  castle; but since it is indeed no castle, but an inn, all that you  have now to do is to excuse the payment; for I cannot act contrary to  the law of knights-errant, of whom I certainly know (having hitherto  read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or  anything else in the inns where they reposed; because every  accommodation is legally and justly due to them, in return for the  insufferable hardships they endure while in quest of adventures, by  night and by day, in winter and in summer, on foot and on horseback,  with thirst and with hunger, with heat and with cold; subject to all  the inclemencies of heaven, and to all the inconveniences of earth.\"  \"I see little to my purpose in all this,\" answered the host; \"pay me  what is my due, and let us have none of your stories and  knight-errantries; all I want is to get my own.\" \"Thou art a  blockhead, and a pitiful innkeeper,\" answered Don Quixote: so clapping  spurs to Rozinante, and brandishing his lance, he sallied out of the  inn without opposition, and, never turning to see whether his squire  followed him, was soon a good way off.    The host, seeing him go without paying, ran to seize on Sancho Panza,  who said that, since his master would not pay, neither would he pay;  for being squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and reason held as  good for him as for his master. The innkeeper, irritated on hearing  this, threatened, that if he did not pay him, he should repent his  obstinacy.    Poor Sancho's ill-luck would have it that, among the people in the  inn, there were four clothworkers of Segovia, three needle-makers from  the fountain of Cordova, and two neighbours from the market-place of  Seville,--frolicksome fellows, who, instigated and moved by the  self-same spirit, came up to Sancho, and, having dismounted him, one  of them produced a blanket from the landlord's bed, into which he was  immediately thrown; but, perceiving that the ceiling was too low, they  determined to execute their purpose in the yard, which was bounded  above only by the sky. Thither Sancho was carried; and, being placed  in the middle of the blanket, they began to toss him aloft, and divert  themselves with him as with a dog at Shrovetide. The cries which the  poor blanketed squire sent forth were so many and so loud that they  reached his master's ears; who, stopping to listen attentively,  believed that some new adventure was at hand, until he plainly  recognised "]]]
