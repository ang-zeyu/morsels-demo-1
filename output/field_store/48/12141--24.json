I asked some of the older and more experienced Elders what I  should do. Their answer was that they were also expecting instructions  and that they were more in need of counsel than able to give it.    There were over two hundred teams now on the ground, many of the owners  beginning to get impatient at the delay. I was at a loss what to do, so  I went out after night and asked the Lord to help me out. I told Him  I desired to do exactly what was best, but did not know a thing about  it, and made this proposition that I would take my clerk with me in  the morning, and when a question was asked me by any one what to do,  I would tell the clerk to write down just what first came to my mind.  And if that was right to please remove the spirit of oppression that I  was laboring under and allow me to go back to the fort and enjoy myself  with my friends. My mind was at once entirely relieved. I went and  passed a pleasant evening.    Next morning without saying anything about the lack of instructions we  commenced business. Soon some one asked whose teams were to be loaded  first, I dictated to my clerk. Thus we continued. As fast as the clerk  put them down, orders would be given, and we passed on to the next. We  continued this for four days. Everything that I felt to be my duty was  done. All the teams were loaded up, companies organized and started  back, men detailed to remain a while longer. Elders furnished flour,  and a great deal of business was done. A memorandum was kept of all  this.    I hitched up a team and started for home when everything was in  shape. I reached Salt Lake City a few hours ahead of the freight  teams, and went to President Young's office. He was very glad to see  me, expressing much sympathy and saying that if he had known of our  suffering in time he would have sent us supplies at any cost. I acted  a little stiff for I did not know whether my management of the last  business would be approved of or not, but I was determined to defend my  actions, for I knew I had done the best I could.    Soon Brother Young asked me if I had attended to everything in order  before leaving. My reply was, \"I hope I did but do not know.\"    \"Well, you acted according to my instructions, did you not?\"    \"I don't know. I did not get any instructions, and it was pretty hard  on me.\"    I handed him my book saying: \"Here is a report of what we did; I hope  it is satisfactory.\"    Brother Brigham asked his clerk, T. D. Brown, about the letter of  instructions. Brother Brown said a few days after the last of these  companies left, in looking over his papers he found a letter directed  to D. W. Jones. It was the letter that should have been sent.    Brother Brigham commenced reading my report, and as he read would  remark, \"That is right; this is right. Well, you seemed to get along  all right.\"    I began to feel pretty good. Finally Brother Brown was told to look  over the letter, which was very large, containing many items of special  instructions. My report agreed with the whole of it. This confirmed  me more than ever in my faith in inspiration. Also in the honesty of  Brigham Young and his counseling, for if his instructions had not  been honest I would never have been inspired to anticipate them. The  trouble lies with us; we many times want to dictate the inspiration,  or, in other words, put forward our own ideas and desires and call them  inspirations.    I met my mother-in-law in Salt Lake City and heard from my wife and two  children, who were living with Father P. Colton in Provo. We started  for home the next day, where I met my family after so long and severe a  trip. It was with joy and thankfulness that I greeted my wife, who was  one of the best and most faithful wives that ever blessed a husband.    This was the spring after what is known as the winter of the  Reformation. The reformation move was doubtless intended for and  resulted in good; but like everything else where good is found the  devil comes along to see what's up. So it was nothing strange if while  browsing around he had a hand in some of the moves of men. This I soon  became satisfied was the case now, and I did not take much \"stock\" in  what some people called reformation.    When I left Devil's Gate, it was with the understanding that I was  to return there and take charge of the place as a Y. X. station, but  Brother Brigham countermanded the order, saying that I had had enough  of Devil's Gate for one man.    As I was so sure of going back when I left Devil's Gate I had left  my gun, saddle, a wagon that I had traded for, as well as a lot of  carriage springs that I had gathered up.    In these days there were many things thrown away on the plains that  were of value, and it was profitable to go back with teams and gather  up wagon tires and other things which had been abandoned. I spoke to  Brother Brigham about this. He said he wished me to stop in the city  long enough to help deliver the goods to the owners. Patrick Lynch and  myself were appointed to take charge of them.    I soon learned that strange stories had been put in circulation about  me. I was accused of stealing and hiding away thousands of dollars'  worth of goods. As there was no communication between us and the valley  how this started was a mystery, only to be accounted for by men's  imaginations. So strong was the belief in my guilt that about the time  the reformation was at its height in Provo, a teacher came to visit my  wife, telling her that she ought to leave me and marry some good man. I  could give the name of the teacher, but he is now dead so I will spare  his memory. My wife answered, \"Well I will not leave Daniel Jones. I  cannot better myself, for if he will steal there is not an honest man  on earth.\" I always appreciated the answer.    One family who I will also spare as _they_ are not yet dead came to  search my house for stolen goods but did not find any. They professed  to be very sorry for having come. My wife treated them with perfect  civility; no doubt they were ashamed of themselves and are to this day  when they think of the indignity. While delivering their goods I was  often accused of having robbed people. The goods formerly spoken of  being divided to _cache_ were never replaced and I had to bear the blame.  Again, before the trains had stopped in the snow-storms, so I was  informed by some of the brethren who stayed at Devil's Gate, there had  been a number of heavy boxes emptied, the goods stuffed into sacks and  the boxes broken up for firewood. The owners of course looked in vain  for their boxes. Many sacks of goods remained at the Tithing Office  for a long time before being identified by the owners of the goods. I  believe the most of these articles finally got where they belonged.  But in the meantime I was \"Paddy Miles' boy,\" who had done all the  mischief. Brother Lynch felt so indignant that he reported these  accusations to President Young when I received the following letter:    \"President's Office, Great Salt Lake City,                      \"June 11th, 1857.    \"_To the Bishops and Presidents in Utah_,    \"BELOVED BRETHREN:    \"Inasmuch as there are some persons disposed to find fault with the  management of Brother Daniel W. Jones while at Devil's Gate, we feel  desirous to express ourselves perfectly satisfied with his labors while  there, and with the care that he has taken of the property intrusted  to him. He has our confidence, and we say, God bless him for what he  has done. The men who find fault with the labors of Brother Jones the  past winter, we wish their names sent to this office, and when the Lord  presents an opportunity we will try them and see if they will do any  better.                    \"Brigham Young,                  \"Daniel H. Wells,                   \"George D. Grant.\"        CHAPTER XX.    My Trading Trip--President Young Asks me to Meet some False  Charges--Wicked Reports Concerning me--Their Unjustness made  Manifest--The President's Stern Reproof to my Accusers--An Excellent  Recommend.    My wife remained in the city with me during the time we were delivering  the goods, some three weeks. After getting through, I, in company with  W. Roberts of Provo, fitted up a team and went back to trade.    Roberts remained at the South Pass while I went down with two yoke of  oxen to Devil's Gate. It maybe interesting to some to give a brief  description of my trip going down, some ninety miles. Stephen Markham  was in charge of the Y. X. station at the South Pass. He had nine head  of good milk cows in charge which he had orders to send to Devil's Gate  for the use of men stationed there. He offered to furnish me a horse  if I would drive them down. This was agreeable, as I would have had to  foot it otherwise.    As I could not carry provisions very well, and having money, it was  supposed that I could buy bread at least, as there were trains of  California emigrants continually on the road. Cups were scarce, so when  I started out I had nothing but my blankets and gun. I happened to have  a new clay pipe in my pocket. After asking several persons to sell me  a cup and some bread and being refused, concluded to see if I could  not get through with what I had. The cows all gave plenty of milk and  were gentle. I necessarily had to milk them to keep their udders from  spoiling. So when I would get a cow all milked but the strippings I  would put the stem of the pipe into my mouth and milk into the bowl and  draw the milk through. This was about the same as sucking \"mint julep\"  with a straw. I enjoyed it immensely, being fond of new milk.    I found it so much better than eating rawhide that I ceased asking the  emigrants I met for either a cup or bread. I made the trip through in  less than four days; probably felt a little \"calfish\" but never lost my  flesh or strength.

[FN#36] This is, of course, ironical: \"Allah be praised for creating  such a prodigy of learning as thou art!\"  [FN#37] The larger the turband the greater are the individual's  pretensions to religious knowledge and respectability of demeanour.  This is the custom in Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and many other parts of  the Moslem world.

[FN#41] A religious formula used when compelled to mention anything  abominable or polluting to the lips of a pious man.    [p.74]CHAPTER V.    THE RAMAZAN.    THIS year the Ramazan befell in June, and a fearful infliction was that  \"blessed month,\" making the Moslem unhealthy and unamiable. For the  space of sixteen consecutive hours and a quarter, we were forbidden to  eat, drink, smoke, snuff, and even to swallow our saliva designedly. I  say forbidden, for although the highest orders of Turks,-the class is  popularly described as    \"Turco fino  Mangia porco e beve vino.\"-    may break the ordinance in strict privacy, popular opinion would  condemn any open infraction of it with uncommon severity. In this, as  in most human things, how many are there who hold that    \"Pecher en secret n'est pas pecher,  Ce n'est que l'eclat qui fait le crime\"?    The middle and lower ranks observe the duties of the season, however  arduous, with exceeding zeal: of all who suffered severely from such  total abstinence, I found but one patient who would eat even to save  his life. And among the vulgar, sinners who habitually drink when they  should pray, will fast and perform their devotions through the Ramazan.    Like the Italian, the Anglo-Catholic, and the Greek fasts, the chief  effect of the \"blessed month\" upon True Believers is to darken their  tempers into positive gloom.    [p.75]Their voices, never of the softest, acquire, especially after  noon, a terribly harsh and creaking tone. The men curse one  another[FN#1] and beat the women. The women slap and abuse the  children, and these in their turn cruelly entreat, and use bad language  to, the dogs and cats. You can scarcely spend ten minutes in any  populous part of the city without hearing some violent dispute. The  \"Karakun,\" or station-houses, are filled with lords who have  administered an undue dose of chastisement to their ladies, and with  ladies who have scratched, bitten, and otherwise injured the bodies of  their lords. The Mosques are crowded with a sulky, grumbling  population, making themselves offensive to one another on earth whilst  working their way to heaven; and in the shade, under the outer walls,  the little boys who have been expelled the church attempt to forget  their miseries in spiritless play. In the bazars and streets, pale  long-drawn faces, looking for the most part intolerably cross, catch  your eye, and at this season a stranger will sometimes meet with  positive incivility. A shopkeeper, for instance, usually says when he  rejects an insufficient offer, \"Yaftah Allah,\"-\"Allah opens.[FN#2]\"  During the Ramazan, he will grumble about the bore of Ghashim, or  \"Johnny raws,\" and gruffly tell you not to stand there wasting his  time. But as a rule the shops are either shut or destitute of shopmen,  merchants will not purchase, and students will not study. In fine,    [p.76]the Ramazan, for many classes, is one-twelfth of the year  wantonly thrown away.    The following is the routine of a fast day. About half an hour after  midnight, the gun sounds its warning to faithful men that it is time to  prepare for the \"Sahur,\" (early breakfast) or morning meal. My servant  then wakes me, if I have slept; brings water for ablution, spreads the  Sufrah[FN# 3] (or leather cloth); and places before me certain remnants  of the evening's meal. It is some time before the stomach becomes  accustomed to such hours, but in matters of appetite, habit is  everything, and for health's sake one should strive to eat as  plentifully as possible. Then sounds the Salam, or Blessings on the  Prophet,[FN#4] an introduction to the Call of Morning Prayer. Smoking  sundry pipes with tenderness, as if taking leave of a friend; and until  the second gun, fired at about half-past two A.M., gives the  Imsak,[FN#4]-the order to abstain from food,-I wait the Azan,[FN#5]  which in this month is called somewhat earlier than usual. Then, after  a ceremony termed the Niyat[FN#6] (purpose) of fasting, I say my    [p.77]prayers, and prepare for repose.[FN#7] At 7 A.M. the labours of  the day begin for the working classes of society; the rich spend the  night in revelling, and rest in down from dawn till noon.    The first thing on rising is to perform the Wuzu, or lesser ablution,  which invariably follows sleep in a reclining position; without this it  would be improper to pray, to enter the Mosques, to approach a  religious man, or to touch the Koran. A few pauper patients usually  visit me at this hour, report the phenomena of their complaints,-which  they do, by the bye, with unpleasant minuteness of detail,-and receive  fresh instructions. At 9 A.M. Shaykh Mohammed enters, with \"lecture\"  written upon his wrinkled brow; or I pick him up on the way, and  proceed straight to the Mosque Al-Azhar. After three hours' hard  reading, with little interruption from bystanders-this is long  vacation, most of the students being at home-comes the call to mid-day  prayer. The founder of Al-Islam ordained but few devotions for the  morning, which is the business part of the Eastern day; but during the  afternoon and evening they succeed one another rapidly, and their  length increases. It is then time to visit my rich patients, and  afterwards, by way of accustoming myself to the sun, to wander among  the bookshops for an hour or two, or simply to idle in the street. At 3  P.M. I return home, recite the afternoon prayers, and re-apply myself  to study.    This is the worst part of the day. In Egypt the summer nights and  mornings are, generally speaking,    [p.78]pleasant, but the forenoons are sultry, and the afternoons are  serious. A wind wafting the fine dust and furnace-heat of the desert  blows over the city; the ground returns with interest the showers of  caloric from above, and not a cloud or a vapour breaks the dreary  expanse of splendour on high. There being no such comforts as Indian  tatties, and few but the wealthiest houses boasting glass windows, the  interior of your room is somewhat more fiery than the street. Weakened  with fasting, the body feels the heat trebly, and the disordered  stomach almost affects the brain. Every minute is counted with morbid  fixity of idea as it passes on towards the blessed sunset, especially  by those whose terrible lot is manual labour at such a season. A few  try to forget their afternoon miseries in slumber, but most people take  the Kaylulah, or Siesta, shortly after the meridian, holding it  unwholesome to sleep late in the day.    As the Maghrib, the sunset hour, approaches-and how slowly it  comes!-the town seems to recover from a trance. People flock to the  windows and balconies, in order to watch the moment of their release.  Some pray, others tell their beads; while others, gathering together in  groups or paying visits, exert themselves to while away the lagging  time.    O Gladness! at length it sounds, that gun from the citadel.  Simultaneously rises the sweet cry of the Mu'ezzin, calling men to  prayer, and the second cannon booms from the Abbasiyah  Palace,[FN#8]-\"Al Fitar! Al    [p.79]Fitar!\" fast-breaking! fast-breaking! shout the people, and a hum  of joy rises from the silent city. Your acute ears waste not a moment  in conveying the delightful intelligence to your parched tongue, empty  stomach, and languid limbs. You exhaust a pot full of water, no matter  its size. You clap hurried hands[FN#9] for a pipe; you order coffee;  and provided with these comforts, you sit down, and calmly contemplate  the coming pleasures of the evening.    Poor men eat heartily at once. The rich break their fast with a light  meal,-a little bread and fruit, fresh or dry, especially water-melon,  sweetmeats, or such digestible dishes as \"Muhallabah,\"-a thin jelly of  milk, starch, and rice-flour. They then smoke a pipe, drink a cup of  coffee or a glass of sherbet, and recite the evening prayers; for the  devotions of this hour are delicate things, and while smoking a first  pipe after sixteen hours' abstinence, time easily slips away. Then they  sit down to the Fatur (breakfast), the meal of the twenty-four hours,  and eat plentifully, if they would avoid illness.    There are many ways of spending a Ramazan evening. The Egyptians have a  proverb, like ours of the Salernitan school:    [p.80]\"After Al-Ghada rest, if it be but for two moments:  After Al-Asha[FN#10] walk, if it be but two steps.\"    The streets are now crowded with a good-humoured throng of strollers;  the many bent on pleasure, the few wending their way to Mosque, where  the Imam recites \"Tarawih\" prayers.[FN#11] They saunter about, the  accustomed pipe in hand, shopping, for the stalls are open till a late  hour; or they sit in crowds at the coffee-house entrance, smoking  Shishas,[FN#12] (water-pipes), chatting, and listening to  story-tellers, singers and itinerant preachers. Here a bare-footed girl  trills and quavers, accompanied by a noisy tambourine and "]]]
