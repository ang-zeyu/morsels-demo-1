Woman suffrage would have no place in it, but it would be so  worded that a woman-suffrage amendment might be added if any member  chose to move one. In that case, said Mr. Asquith, he should not  consider it the duty of the Government to oppose the amendment if it  were approved by a majority of the House of Commons--_provided_ that the  amendment was on democratic lines, and that it had back of it the  support, the strong and undoubted support, of the women of the country  as well as the present electorate.    One would not suppose that such an evasive utterance as this would be  regarded in any quarter as a promise that woman suffrage would be given  any real chances of success under the Asquith Government. That it was,  by many, taken quite seriously is but another proof of the gullibility  of the party-blinded public. The Liberal press lauded Mr. Asquith's  \"promise,\" and called for a truce of militancy in order that the  Government might have every opportunity to act. Said the _Star_, in a  leader typical of many others: \"The meaning of Mr. Asquith's pledge is  plain. Woman's suffrage will be passed through the House of Commons  before the present Government goes to the country.\"    As for the women's Liberal Associations, they were quite delirious with  joy. In a conference called for the purpose of passing resolutions of  gratitude, Lady Carlisle said: \"This is a glorious day of rejoicing. Our  great Prime Minister, all honour to him, has opened a way to us by which  we can enter into that inheritance from which we have been too long  debarred.\"    At the two following by-elections, the last of the series, enormous  posters were exhibited, \"Premier's Great Reform Bill: Votes for Women.\"  We tried to tell the electors that the pledge was false on the face of  it; that the specious proviso that the amendment be \"democratic\" left no  doubt that the Government would cause the rejection of any practical  amendment that might be moved. Our words fell on deaf ears, and the  Liberal majorities soared.    Just a week later Mr. Asquith was questioned in the House of Commons by  a slightly alarmed anti-suffragist member. The member asked Mr. Asquith  whether he considered himself pledged to introduce the reform hill  during that Parliament, whether he meant to allow such a bill to carry a  woman-suffrage amendment, if such were moved, and whether, in that case,  the suffrage amendment would become part of the Government policy.  Evasive as ever, the Prime Minister, after some sparring, replied, \"My  honourable friend has asked me a question with regard to a remote and  speculative future.\" Thus was our interpretation of Mr. Asquith's  \"promise\" justified from his own lips. Yet the Liberal women still clung  to the hope of Government action, and the Liberal press pretended to  cling to it. As for the Women's Social and Political Union, we prepared  for more work. We had to strike out along a new line, since it was  evident that the Government could, for a time at least, neutralise our  by-election work by more false promises. Consistent with our policy, of  never going further than the Government compelled us to go, we made our  first action a perfectly peaceable one.    On the day when the Stanger bill had reached its second reading in the  House, and several days after I had gone to Holloway for the first time,  Mr. Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, made a speech which greatly  interested the Suffragettes. He professed himself a suffragist, and  declared that he intended to vote for the bill. Nevertheless, he was  confident that it could not pass, because of the division in the  Cabinet, and because it had no political party united either for or  against it. Woman suffrage, said Mr. Gladstone, must advance to victory  through all the stages that are required for great reforms to mature.  First academic discussion, then effective action, was the history of  men's suffrage; it must be the same with women's suffrage. \"Men,\"  declared Mr. Gladstone, \"have learned this lesson and know the necessity  for demonstrating the greatness of their movement, and for establishing  that _force majeure_ which actuates and arms a Government for effective  work. That is the task before the supporters of this great movement.  Looking back at the great political crises in the thirties, the sixties  and the eighties, it will be found that the people did not go about in  small crowds, nor were they content with enthusiastic meetings in large  halls; they assembled in their tens of thousands all over the country.    \"Of course,\" added Mr. Gladstone, \"it is not to be expected that women  can assemble in such masses, but power belongs to masses, and through  this power a Government can be influenced into more effective action  than a Government will be likely to take under present conditions.\"    The Women's Social and Political Union determined to answer this  challenge. If assembling in great masses was all that was necessary to  convince the Government that woman suffrage had passed the academic  stage and now demanded political action, we thought we could undertake  to satisfy the most skeptical member of the Cabinet. We knew that we  could organise a demonstration that would out-rival any of the great  franchise demonstrations held by men in the thirties, sixties, and  eighties. The largest number of people ever gathered in Hyde Park was  said to have approximated 72,000. We determined to organise a Hyde Park  demonstration of at least 250,000 people. Sunday, June 21, 1908, was  fixed for the date of this demonstration, and for many months we worked  to make it a day notable in the history of the movement. Our example was  emulated by the non-militant suffragists, who organised a fine  procession of their own, about a week before our demonstration. Thirteen  thousand women, it was said, marched in that procession.    On our demonstration we spent, for advertising alone, over a thousand  pounds, or five thousand dollars. We covered the hoardings of London and  of all the principal provincial cities with great posters bearing  portraits of the women who were to preside at the twenty platforms from  which speeches were to be made; a map of London, showing the routes by  which the seven processions were to advance, and a plan of the Hyde Park  meeting-place were also shown. London, of course, was thoroughly  organised. For weeks a small army of women was busy chalking  announcements on sidewalks, distributing handbills, canvassing from  house to house, advertising the demonstration by posters and sandwich  boards carried through the streets. We invited everybody to be present,  including both Houses of Parliament. A few days before the demonstration  Mrs. Drummond and a number of other women hired and decorated a launch  and sailed up the Thames to the Houses of Parliament, arriving at the  hour when members entertain their women friends at tea on the terrace.  Everyone left the tables and crowded to the water's edge as the boat  stopped, and Mrs. Drummond's strong, clear voice pealed out her  invitation to the Cabinet and the members of Parliament to join the  women's demonstration in Hyde Park. \"Come to the park on Sunday,\" she  cried. \"You shall have police protection, and there will be no arrests,  we promise you.\" An alarmed someone telephoned for the police boats, but  as they appeared, the women's boat steamed away.    What a day was Sunday, June 21st--clear, radiant, filled with golden  sunshine! As I advanced, leading, with the venerable Mrs.  Wolstenholm-Elmy, the first of the seven processions, it seemed to me  that all London had turned out to witness our demonstration. And a  goodly part of London followed the processions. When I mounted my  platform in Hyde Park, and surveyed the mighty throngs that waited there  and the endless crowds that were still pouring into the park from all  directions, I was filled with amazement not unmixed with awe. Never had  I imagined that so many people could be gathered together to share in a  political demonstration. It was a gay and beautiful as well as an  awe-inspiring spectacle, for the white gowns and flower-trimmed hats of  the women, against the background of ancient trees, gave the park the  appearance of a vast garden in full bloom.    The bugles sounded, and the speakers at each of the twenty platforms  began their addresses, which could not have been heard by more than half  or a third of the vast audience. Notwithstanding this, they remained to  the end. At five o'clock the bugles sounded again, the speaking ceased,  and the resolution calling upon the Government to bring in an official  woman-suffrage bill without delay was carried at every platform, often  without a dissenting vote. Then, with a three-times-repeated cry of  \"Votes for Women!\" from the assembled multitude, the great meeting  dispersed.    The London _Times_ said next day: \"Its organisers had counted on an  audience of 250,000. That expectation was certainly fulfilled, and  probably it was doubled, and it would be difficult to contradict any one  who asserted that it was trebled. Like the distances and the number of  the stars, the facts were beyond the threshold of perception.\"    The _Daily Express_ said: \"It is probable that so many people never  before stood in one square mass anywhere in England. Men who saw the  great Gladstone meeting years ago said that compared with yesterday's  multitude it was as nothing.\"    We felt that we had answered the challenge in Mr. Gladstone's  declaration that \"power belongs to the masses,\" and that through this  power the Government could be influenced; so it was with real hope that  we despatched a copy of the resolution to the Prime Minister, asking him  what answer the Government would make to that unparalleled gathering of  men and women. Mr. Asquith replied formally that he had nothing to add  to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#18)"],[1,"trongest. The same strong  susceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful,  are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate love  of virtue, and the sternest self-control. It is through the cultivation  of these, that society both does its duty and protects its interests:  not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows  not how to make them. A person whose desires and impulses are his  own--are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed and  modified by his own culture--is said to have a character. One whose  desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a  steam-engine has a character. If, in addition to being his own, his  impulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, he  has an energetic character. Whoever thinks that individuality of  desires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, must  maintain that society has no need of strong natures--is not the better  for containing many persons who have much character--and that a high  general average of energy is not desirable.    In some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, too  much ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining and  controlling them. There has been a time when the element of spontaneity  and individuality was in excess, and the social principle had a hard  struggle with it. The difficulty then was, to induce men of strong  bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to  control their impulses. To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline,  like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power over  the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his  character--which society had not found any other sufficient means of  binding. But society has now fairly got the better of individuality; and  the danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the  deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences. Things are vastly  changed, since the passions of those who were strong by station or by  personal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws  and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the  persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security. In our  times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every one  lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. Not only in  what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the  individual, or the family, do not ask themselves--what do I prefer? or,  what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the  best and highest in me to have fair-play, and enable it to grow and  thrive? They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is  usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or  (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and  circumstances superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is  customary, in preference to what suits their own inclination. It does  not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary.  Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for  pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they live in crowds;  they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of  taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until  by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to  follow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they become  incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally  without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their  own. Now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature?    It is so, on the Calvinistic theory. According to that, the one great  offence of man is Self-will. All the good of which humanity is capable,  is comprised in Obedience. You have no choice; thus you must do, and no  otherwise: \"whatever is not a duty, is a sin.\" Human nature being  radically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature  is killed within him. To one holding this theory of life, crushing out  any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no  evil: man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the  will of God: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose  but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without  them. That is the theory of Calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated  form, by many who do not consider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation  consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will  of God; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of  their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer,  but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by  authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the  same for all.    In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to  this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of  human character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely  think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker  designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much  finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of  animals, than as nature made them. But if it be any part of religion to  believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with  that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties that  they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and  that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to  the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their  capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. There is a  different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of  humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than  merely to be abnegated. \"Pagan self-assertion\" is one of the elements of  human worth, as well as \"Christian self-denial.\"[12] There is a Greek  ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of  self-government blends with, but does not supersede. It may be better to  be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles  than either; nor would a Pericles, if we had one in these days, be  without anything good which belonged to John Knox.    It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in  themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the  limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings  become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works  partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human  life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more  abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and  strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by  making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to  the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable  to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others.  There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when  there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is  composed of them. As much compression as is necessary to prevent the  stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of  others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample  compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means  of development which the individual loses by being prevented from  gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly  obtained at the expense of the development of other people. And even to  himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the  social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon  the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of  others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of  others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting  their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except  such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint.  If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any  fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons  should be allowed to lead different lives. In proportion as this  latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to  posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as  Individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is  despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes  to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men.    Having said that Individuality is the same thing with development, and  that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can  produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument:  for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs,  than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing  they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than  that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations will not  suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary  further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to  the undeveloped--to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and  would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible  manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without  hindrance.    In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might"]]]
