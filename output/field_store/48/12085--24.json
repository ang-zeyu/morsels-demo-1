Everyone shall be brought within a hundred and under surety,  and his surety shall hold and bring him to the performance of every  legal duty.    *Everyone over age 12 shall take an oath that he will not be a thief or  a thief's accomplice.    Every trustworthy man, who has never earned a bad reputation and who  has never failed either in oath or in ordeal, shall be entitled to  clear himself within the hundred by the simple oath of exculpation. For  an untrustworthy man compurgators for the simple oath shall be selected  within three hundreds, and for the triple oath, throughout the district  under the jurisdiction of the borough court; otherwise he shall go to  the ordeal. When a simple oath of exculpation is involved, the case  shall be begun with a simple oath of accusation; but where a triple  oath of exculpation is involved, it shall be begun with a triple oath  of accusation. A thegn may have a trustworthy man give his oath of  accusation for him.    No man may vouch to warranty unless he has three trustworthy witnesses  to declare whence he acquired the stock which is attached in his  possession. The witnesses shall declare that, in bearing testimony on  his behalf to the effect that he acquired it legally, they are speaking  the truth, in accordance with what they saw with their eyes and heard  with their ears.    *No one shall buy anything over 4d. in value, either livestock or other  property, unless he has four men as trustworthy witnesses, whether the  purchase be made within a town or in the open country. If, however, any  property is attached, and he who is in possession of it has no such  witnesses, no vouching to warranty shall be allowed, but the property  shall be given up to its rightful owner and also the supplementary  payment, and the fine to the party who is entitled thereto. And if he  has witnesses in accordance with what we have declared above, vouching  to warranty shall take place three times. On the fourth occasion he  shall prove his claim to it or give it back to its rightful owner. No  one shall claim ownership where fraud is involved.    *If anyone who is of bad reputation and unworthy of public confidence  fails to attend the court meetings three times, men shall be chosen  from the fourth meeting who shall ride to him, and he may then still  find a surety, if he can. If he cannot, they shall seize him either  alive or dead, and they shall take all that he has. And they shall pay  to the accuser the value of his goods, and the lord shall take half of  what remains and the hundred half. And if anyone, either kinsman or  stranger, refuses to ride against him, he shall pay the king 120s.    *The proved thief and he who has been discovered in treason against his  lord, whatever sanctuary he seeks, shall never be able to save his life.    He who in court tries to protect himself or one of his men by bringing  a countercharge shall have wasted his words, and shall meet the charge  brought by his opponent in such a way as the hundred court shall  determine.    No one shall entertain any man for more than three days, unless he is  committed to this charge by the man whom he has been serving. And no  one shall dismiss one of his men from his service until he is quit of  every accusation which has been brought against him.    *If anyone comes upon a thief and of his own accord lets him escape  without raising the hue and cry, he shall make compensation by the  payment of the thief's wergeld, or clear himself with the full oath,  asserting that he did not know him to be guilty of any crime. And if  anyone hears the hue and cry and neglects it, he shall pay the full  fine for insubordination [120s] to the king, or clear himself by the  full oath.    *Regarding thoroughly untrustworthy men, if anyone has forfeited the  confidence of the hundred, and he has charges brought against him to  such an extent that he is accused by three men at once, no other course  shall be open to him but to go to the triple ordeal. If, however, his  lord asserts that he has failed neither in oath nor in ordeal since the  assembly was held at Winchester, the lord shall choose two trustworthy  men within the hundred - unless he has a reeve who is qualified to  discharge this duty - and they shall swear that he has never failed in  oath or ordeal or been convicted of stealing. If the oath is  forthcoming, the man who is accused there shall choose whichever he  will - either the simple ordeal or an oath equivalent to a pound in  value, supported by compurgators found within the three hundreds, in  the case of an object over 30d. in value. If they dare not give the  oath, the accused shall go to the triple ordeal, which shall be opened  by five compurgators selected by the accuser and he himself shall make  a sixth. If the accused is proved guilty, on the first occasion he  shall pay double value to the accuser and his wergeld to the lord who  is entitled to receive his fine, and he shall appoint trustworthy  sureties, that hence forth he will desist from all wrong-doing. And on  the second occasion, if he is proved guilty, there shall be no  compensation but to have his hands or his feet cut off or both,  according to the nature of the offense. And if has wrought still  greater crime, he shall have his eyes put out and his nose and ears and  upper lip cut off or his scalp removed, whichever of these penalties is  determined by those with whom rests the decision of the case; and thus  punishment shall be inflicted, while, at the same time, the soul is  preserved from injury. If, however, he escapes and avoids the ordeal,  his surety shall pay the value of his goods to the plaintiff and the  wergeld of the accused to the king or to the man who is entitled to  receive his wergeld. And if the lord is accused of advising the man who  had done wrong to escape, he shall choose five trustworthy men, and  shall himself make a sixth, and shall clear himself of the accusation.  If he succeeds in clearing himself, he shall be entitled to the  wergeld. And if he fails, the king shall take the wergeld, and the  thief shall be treated as an outlaw by the whole nation.    Every lord shall be personally responsible as surety for the men of his  own household. And if any accusation is brought against one of them, he  shall answer if within the hundred in which he is accused. And if he is  accused and escapes, the lord shall pay the man's wergeld to the king.  And if the lord is accused of advising him to escape, he shall clear  himself with the help of five thegns, himself making a sixth. And if he  fails to clear himself, he shall pay his own wergeld to the king, and  the man shall be an outlaw towards the king.    If a slave is found guilty at the ordeal, he shall be branded on the  first occasion. And on the second occasion, he shall not be able to  make any amends except by his head.    *Concerning untrustworthy men, if there is anyone who is regarded with  suspicion by the general public, the king's reeve shall go and place  him under surety so that he a may be brought to do justice to those who  have made charges against him. If he has no surety, he shall be slain  and buried in unconsecrated ground. And if anyone interposes in his  defense, they shall both incur the same punishment. And he who ignores  this and will not further what we have all determined upon shall pay  120s. to the king.    The various boroughs shall have one common law with regard to  exculpation.    If a friendless man or one come from afar is so utterly destitute of  friends as not to be able to produce a surety, on the first occasion  that he is accused he shall go to prison, and wait there until he goes  to God's ordeal where he shall experience whatever he can. Verily, he  who pronounces a more severe judgment upon whom is friendless or come  from afar than upon one of his own acquaintances injures himself.    *Concerning perjury, if anyone swears a false oath on the relics and is  convicted, he shall lose his hand or half his wergeld which shall be  divided between the lord and the bishop. And henceforth he shall not be  entitled to swear an oath, unless he makes amends to the best of his  ability before God, and finds surety that ever afterwards he will  desist from such perjury.    *Concerning false witness, if anyone has given testimony which is  manifestly false, and is convicted thereof, his testimony henceforth  shall be valueless, and he shall pay to the king or to the lord of the  manor a sum equivalent to his healsfang [payment due only to those very  closely related to a killed man].    Special care must be taken to prevent lawlessness at sacred seasons and  in sacred places. The greater a man is and the higher his rank, the  more stringent shall be the amends which he shall be required to make  to God and to men for lawless behavior. And ecclesiastical amends shall  be diligently exacted in accordance with the directions contained in  the canon law, and secular amends in accordance with secular law.    If anyone slays a priest of the altar, he shall be both excommunicated  and outlawed, unless he make amends to the best of his ability by  pilgrimage, and likewise by the payment of compensation to the kin of  the slain man, or else he shall clear himself by an oath equal in value  to his wergeld. He shall begin to make amends to God and men within 30  days, under pain of forfeiting all that he possesses.    If an attempt is made to deprive a man in orders or a stranger of his  goods or his life, the king shall act as his kinsman and protector  unless he has some other. And such compensation as is fitting shall be  paid to the king, or he shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#18)"],[1," me lady too.      KAS.

Come, lady: I knew the Doctor would not leave,    Till he had found the very nick of her fortune.      KAS. To be a countess, say you, a Spanish countess, sir?      DAME P. Why, is that better than an English countess?      FACE. Better! 'Slight, make you that a question, lady?      KAS. Nay, she is a fool, captain, you must pardon her.      FACE. Ask from your courtier, to your inns-of-court-man,    To your mere milliner; they will tell you all,    Your Spanish gennet is the best horse; your Spanish    Stoup is the best garb; your Spanish beard    Is the best cut; your Spanish ruffs are the best    Wear; your Spanish pavin the best dance;    Your Spanish titillation in a glove    The best perfume: and for your Spanish pike,    And Spanish blade, let your poor captain speak--    Here comes the doctor.      [ENTER SUBTLE, WITH A PAPER.]      SUB. My most honour'd lady,    For so I am now to style you, having found    By this my scheme, you are to undergo    An honourable fortune, very shortly.    What will you say now, if some--      FACE. I have told her all, sir,    And her right worshipful brother here, that she shall be    A countess; do not delay them, sir; a Spanish countess.      SUB. Still, my scarce-worshipful captain, you can keep    No secret! Well, since he has told you, madam,    Do you forgive him, and I do.      KAS. She shall do that, sir;    I'll look to it, 'tis my charge.      SUB. Well then: nought rests    But that she fit her love now to her fortune.      DAME P. Truly I shall never brook a Spaniard.      SUB. No!      DAME P. Never since eighty-eight could I abide them,    And that was some three year afore I was born, in truth.      SUB. Come, you must love him, or be miserable,    Choose which you will.      FACE. By this good rush, persuade her,    She will cry strawberries else within this twelvemonth.      SUB. Nay, shads and mackerel, which is worse.      FACE. Indeed, sir!      KAS. Od's lid, you shall love him, or I'll kick you.      DAME P. Why,    I'll do as you will have me, brother.      KAS. Do,    Or by this hand I'll maul you.      FACE. Nay, good sir,    Be not so fierce.      SUB. No, my enraged child;    She will be ruled. What, when she comes to taste    The pleasures of a countess! to be courted--      FACE. And kiss'd, and ruffled!      SUB. Ay, behind the hangings.      FACE. And then come forth in pomp!      SUB.
