Rushing into the midst Sir Guy slew Otho and Sir Thierry carried off  Osile, whereupon they returned to Sir Amys with light hearts. And when  the Duke of Lorraine had tidings of what had befallen Otho he had great  fear of Sir Guy, and sent Sir Heraud back with costly gifts to make his  peace. So Sir Thierry and Osile were wed, and a sumptuous banquet was  held in their honour, with game, and hunting, and hawking, and justing,  and singing of glee-men, more than can be told.    Now as Sir Guy went a-hunting one day, he rode away from his party to  pursue a boar of great size. And this boar, being very nimble and fleet  of foot, led him a long chase till he came into Flanders. And when he  killed the boar he blew upon his horn the prize. Florentine, King of  Flanders, hearing it in his palace, said, \"Who is this that slays the  tall game on my lands?\" And he bade his son go forth and bring him in.  The young prince coming with a haughty message to Sir Guy, the knight  struck him with his hunting-horn, meaning no more than chastisement for  his discourtesy. But by misadventure the prince fell dead at his feet.  Thinking no more of the mishap, and knowing not who it was whom he had  slain, Sir Guy rode on to the palace, and was received with good cheer  at the King's table. But presently the prince's body being brought in,  and Guy owning that he had done this deed, King Florentine took up an  axe, and aimed a mighty blow at the slayer of his son. This Sir Guy  quickly avoided, and when all arose to seize him, he smote them down on  either hand, and fought his way through the hall till he reached his  steed, whereon lightly leaping he hasted back to Sir Thierry.    Then after a short while he took leave of Sir Thierry, and came with Sir  Heraud to England, to the court of King Athelstan at York. Scarce had he  arrived there when tidings came that a great black and winged dragon was  ravaging Northumberland, and had destroyed whole troops of men which  went against him. Sir Guy at once armed himself in his best proven  armour, and rode off in quest of the monster. He battled with the dragon  from prime till undern, and on from undern until evensong, but for all  the dragon was so strong and his hide so flinty Sir Guy overcame him,  and thrust his sword down the dragon's throat, and having cut off his  head brought it to King Athelstan. Then while all England rang with this  great exploit, he took his journey to Wallingford to see his parents.  But they were dead; so after grieving many days for them he gave his  inheritance to Sir Heraud, and hasted to Felice at Warwick.    Proudly she welcomed her true knight, and listened to the story of his  deeds. Then laughingly Sir Guy asked, should he go another quest before  they two were wed?    \"Nay, dear one,\" said Felice, \"my heart misgives me I was wrong to peril  your life so long for fame's sake and my pride in you. A great  love-longing I have borne to have you home beside me. But now you shall  go no more forth. My pride it was that made me wish you great and  famous, and for that I bade you go; but now, beside your greatness and  your fame, I am become so little and so unworthy that I grow jealous  lest you seek a worthier mate. We will not part again, dear lord Sir  Guy.\" Then he kissed her tenderly and said, \"Felice, whatever of fame  and renown I may have gained, I owe it all to you. It was won for you,  and but for you it had not been--and so I lay it at your feet in loving  homage, owning that I hold it all of you.\"    So they were wed amid the joy of all the town of Warwick; for the  spousings were of right royal sort, and Earl Rohand held a great  tournament, and kept open court to all Warwick, Rockingham, and Oxford  for fourteen days.    Forty days they had been wed, when it happened that as Sir Guy lay by a  window of his tower, looking out upon the landscape, he fell to musing  on his life. He thought, \"How many men I have slain, how many battles I  have fought, how many lands I have taken and destroyed! All for a  woman's love; and not one single deed done for my God!\" Then he thought,  \"I will go a pilgrimage for the sake of the Holy Cross.\" And when Felice  knew what he meditated she wept, and with many bitter tears besought him  not to leave her. But he sighed and said, \"Not yet one single deed for  God above!\" and held fast to his intent. So he clad himself in palmer's  dress, and having taken a gold ring from his wife's hand and placed upon  his own, he set out without any companion for the Holy Land.    But Felice fell into a great wan-hope at his departure, and grieved  continually, neither would be comforted; for she said, \"I have brought  this on myself by sending him such perilous journeys heretofore, and now  I cannot bear to part from him.\" But that she bore his child she would  have taken her own life for very trouble of heart; only for that child's  sake she was fain to live and mature it when it should be born.    Now after Sir Guy had made his toilsome pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and  shrived him of his life, and done his prayers and penances about the  holy places, he took his way to Antioch.    Beside a well he met a certain Earl Jonas, whose fifteen sons were held  in prison till he should find a champion to deliver the Saracen Sir  Triamour from the hands of a fierce and terrible Ethiopian giant named  Amiraunt. So Sir Guy took arms again, and rode into the lists, and  fought with Amiraunt and slew him; thus both Sir Triamour was delivered  from his enemy, and the sons of Earl Jonas were restored to him. After  this, Sir Guy travelled many years as a pilgrim of the Cross, till in  his wanderings, chancing to come into Almayne, he there fell in with Sir  Thierry, who, dressed in palmer's weeds, made sorry complaint. Sir  Thierry told how a knight named Barnard inherited Pavia in the room of  his cousin Duke Otho; and how Barnard, being at enmity with him because  of the slaying of Duke Otho, had never rested from doing him mischief  with his sovereign, until the Duke of Lorraine dispossessed him from his  lands and brought him into poverty. Howbeit Sir Guy would not reveal  himself, and Sir Thierry being faint and weary, laid his head upon Sir  Guy's knees, and so great a heaviness came over him that he fell asleep.  As he slept, Sir Guy, watching him, saw a small white weasel creep out  from the mouth of the sleeping man, and run to a little rivulet that was  hard by, going to and fro beside the bank, not seeming wistful how to  get across. Then Sir Guy rose gently and laid his sword athwart the  stream from bank to bank; so the weasel passed over the sword, as it had  been a bridge, and having made his way to a hole at the foot of the hill  on the other side, went in thereat. But presently the weasel came out,  and crossing the stream in the same manner as before jumped into the  sleeper's mouth again. Then Sir Thierry woke and told his dream. \"I  dreamed,\" said he, \"that I came beside a mighty torrent which I knew not  how to pass, until I found a bridge of shining steel, over which I went,  and came into a cavern underground, and therein I found a palace full of  gold and jewels. I pray thee, brother palmer, read to me this dream.\"    Then Sir Guy said that without doubt it betokened a fair treasure hid by  a waterside, and with that showed him the hole under the hill whereat he  had seen the weasel go in. There they digged and found the treasure,  which was very great; yet Sir Guy would have no share therein, but took  leave of Sir Thierry without ever making himself known, and came to  Lorraine the duke that was Sir Thierry's sovereign.    Seeing a palmer the Duke of Lorraine asked tidings of his travels.  \"Sir,\" said the palmer, \"men in all lands speak of Sir Thierry, and much  do blame you for taking away his heritage at the bidding of so false a  knight as Sir Barnard. And palmer though I be, I yet will prove Sir  Barnard recreant and traitor upon his body, and thereto I cast down my  glove.\" Then Sir Barnard took up the glove, and Sir Guy being furnished  with armour and a sword and shield and spear, they did battle together.  And in the end Sir Guy overcame and slew Sir Barnard, and demanded of  the duke to restore Sir Thierry to his possessions, which being granted,  he went in search of the banished man, and having found him in a church  making his prayer, brought him straightway to the duke, and thus they  were made friends. And when Sir Thierry found who his deliverer was he  was exceeding glad and would willingly have divided all his inheritance  with him. But Sir Guy would receive neither fee nor reward, and after he  had abode some time with him at the court, he took his way to England.    Now Athelstan was besieged in Winchester by Anlaf King of Denmark, and  could not come out of the city for the great host that was arrayed  against him, whilst all the folk within the city walls were famishing  for want of food and thought of nothing but surrender. Moreover King  Anlaf had proclaimed a challenge, giving them seven days' grace wherein  either to deliver up the city keys, or to find a champion who should  fight against the great and terrible Danish giant Colbrand; and every  day for seven days' the giant came before the walls and cried for a man  to fight with him. But there was found no man so hardy to do battle with  Colbrand. Then King Athelstan, as he walked to and fro in his city and  saw the distress of his people, was suddenly aware of a light that shone  about him very brightly, and he heard a voice which charged him to  intrust his cause to the first poor palmer he should meet. Soon after he  met a palmer in the city, and weening not that it was Sir Guy, kneeled  humbly to him, in sure faith in the heavenly voice, and asked his help.  \"I am an old man,\" said the palmer, \"with little strength except what  Heaven might give me for a people's need beset by enemies.

The latter  had besides, Officers Marsh and Clancy (a stenographer).    The reward for the capture of Booth will be distributed between very  many men. The negro, Swan, will get as much of it, as he deserves. It  amounts to about eighty thousand dollars, but the War Department may  increase it at discretion. The entire rewards amount to a hundred and  sixty odd thousand. Major O'Bierne should get a large part of it as  well.    This story which I must close abruptly, deserves to be re-written, with  all its accessory endeavours. What I have said is in skeleton merely,  and far from exhaustive.          LETTER VII.    THE MARTYR.      Washington, May 14.    I am sitting in the President's office. He was here very lately, but he  will not return to dispossess me of this high-backed chair he filled so  long, nor resume his daily work at the table where I am writing.    There are here only Major Hay and the friend who accompanies me. A  bright-faced boy runs in and out, darkly attired, so that his fob-chain  of gold is the only relief to his mourning garb. This is little Tad.,  the pet of the White House. That great death, with which the world  rings, has made upon him only the light impression which all things make  upon childhood. He will live to be a man pointed out everywhere, for his  father's sake; and as folks look at him, the tableau of the murder will  seem to encircle him.    The room is long and high, and so thickly hung with maps that the color  of the wall cannot be discerned. The President's table at which I am  seated, adjoins a window at the farthest corner; and to the left of my  chair as I recline in it, there is a large table before an empty grate,  around which there are many chairs, where the cabinet used to assemble.  The carpet is trodden thin, and the brilliance of its dyes is lost. The  furniture is of the formal cabinet class, stately and semi-comfortable;  there are book cases sprinkled with the sparse library of a country  lawyer, but lately plethoric, like the thin body which has departed in  its coffin. They are taking away Mr. Lincoln's private effects, to  deposit them wheresoever his family may abide, and the emptiness of the  place, on this sunny Sunday, revives that feeling of desolation from  which the land has scarce recovered. I rise from my seat and examine the  maps; they are from the coast survey and engineer departments, and  exhibit all the contested grounds of the war: there are pencil lines  upon them where some one has traced the route of armies, and planned the  strategic circumferences of campaigns. Was it the dead President who so  followed the march of empire, and dotted the sites of shock and  overthrow?    Here is the Manassas country--here the long reach of the wasted  Shenandoah; here the wavy line of the James and the sinuous peninsula.  The wide campagna of the gulf country sways in the Potomac breeze that  filters in at the window, and the Mississippi climbs up the wall, with  blotches of blue and red to show where blood gushed at the bursting of  deadly bombs. So, in the half-gloomy, half-grand apartment, roamed the  tall and wrinkled figure whom the country had summoned from his plain  home into mighty history, with the geography of the republic drawn into  a narrow compass so that he might lay his great brown hand upon it  everywhere. And walking to and fro, to and fro, to measure the destinies  of arms, he often stopped, with his thoughtful eyes upon the carpet, to  ask if his life were real and if he were the arbiter of so tremendous  issues, or whether it was not all a fever-dream, snatched from his sofa  in the routine office of the Prairie state.    There is but one picture on the marble mantel over the cold grate--John  Bright, a photograph.    I can well imagine how the mind of Mr. Lincoln often went afar to the  face of Bright, who said so kindly things of him when Europe was mocking  his homely guise and provincial phraseology. To Mr. Lincoln, John Bright  was the standard-bearer of America and democracy in the old world. He  thrilled over Bright's bold denunciations of peer and \"Privilege,\" and  stretched his long arm across the Atlantic to take that daring Quaker  innovator by the hand.    I see some books on the table; perhaps they have lain there undisturbed  since the reader's dimming eyes grew nerveless. A parliamentary manual,  a Thesaurus, and two books of humor, \"Orpheus C. Kerr,\" and \"Artemus  Ward.\" These last were read by Mr. Lincoln in the pauses of his hard  day's labor. Their tenure here bears out the popular verdict of his  partiality for a good joke; and, through the window, from the seat of  Mr. Lincoln, I see across the grassy grounds of the capitol, the broken  shaft of the Washington Monument, the long bridge and the fort-tipped  Heights of Arlington, reaching down to the shining river side. These  scenes he looked at often to catch some freshness of leaf and water, and  often raised the sash to let the world rush in where only the nation  abided, and hence on that awful night, he departed early, to forget this  room and its close applications in the _abandon_ of the theater.    I wonder if that were the least of Booth's crimes--to slay this public  servant in the stolen hour of recreation he enjoyed but seldom. We  worked his life out here, and killed him when he asked a holiday.    Outside of this room there is an office, where his secretaries sat--a  room more narrow but as long--and opposite this adjacent office, a  second door, directly behind Mr. Lincoln's chair leads by a private  passage to his family quarters. This passage is his only monument in the  building; he added nor subtracted nothing else; it tells a long story of  duns and loiterers, contract-hunters and seekers for commissions,  garrulous parents on paltry errands, toadies without measure and talkers  without conscience. They pressed upon him through the great door  opposite his window, and hat in hand, come courtsying to his chair, with  an obsequious \"Mr. President!\"    If he dared, though the chief magistrate and commander of the army and  navy, to go out of the great door, these vampires leaped upon him with  their Babylonian pleas, and barred his walk to his hearthside. He could  not insult them since it was not in his nature, and perhaps many of them  had really urgent errands. So he called up the carpenter and ordered a  strategic route cut from his office to his hearth, and perhaps told of  it after with much merriment.    Here should be written the biography of his official life--in the room  where have concentrated all the wires of action, and where have  proceeded the resolves which vitalized in historic deeds. But only the  great measures, however carried out, were conceived in this office. The  little ones proceeded from other places..    Here once came Mr. Stanton, saying in his hard and positive way:    \"Mr. Lincoln, I have found it expedient to disgrace and arrest General  Stone.\"    \"Stanton,\" said Mr. Lincoln, with an emotion of pain, \"when you  considered it necessary to imprison General Stone, I am glad you did not  consult me about it.\"    And for lack of such consultation, General Stone, I learn, now lies a  maniac in the asylum. The groundless pretext, upon which he suffered the  reputation of treason, issued from the Department of War--not from this  office.    But as to his biography, it is to be written by Colonel Nicolay and  Major Hay. They are to go to Paris together, one as attache of legation,  the other as consul, and while there, will undertake the labor. They are  the only men who know his life well enough to exhaust it, having  followed his official tasks as closely as they shared his social hours.    Major Hay is a gentleman of literary force. Colonel Nicolay has a fine  judgment of character and public measures. Together they should satisfy  both curiosity and history.    As I hear from my acquaintances here these episodes of the President's  life, I recall many reminiscences of his ride from Springfield to  Harrisburg, over much of which I passed. Then he left home and became an  inhabitant of history. His face was solid and healthy, his step young,  his speech and manner bold and kindly. I saw him at Trenton stand in the  Legislature, and say, in his conversational intonation:    \"We may have to put the foot down firm.\"    How should we have hung upon his accents then had we anticipated his  virtues and his fate.    Death is requisite to make opinion grave. We looked upon Mr. Lincoln  then as an amusing sensation, and there was much guffaw as he was  regarded by the populace; he had not passed out of partisan ownership.  Little by little, afterward, he won esteem, and often admiration, until  the measure of his life was full, and the victories he had achieved made  the world applaud him. Yet, at this date, the President was sadly  changed. Four years of perplexity and devotion had wrinkled his face,  and stooped his shoulders, and the failing eyes that glared upon the  play closed as his mission was completed, and the world had been  educated enough to comprehend him.    The White House has been more of a Republican mansion under his control  than for many administrations. Uncouth guests came to it often, typical  of the simple western civilization of which he was a graduate, and while  no coarse altercation has ever ensued, the portal has swung wide for  five years.    A friend, connected with a Washington newspaper, told me that he had  occasion to see Mr. Lincoln one evening, and found that the latter had  gone to bed. But he was told to sit down in the office, and directly the  President entered. He wore only a night shirt, and his long, lank  hirsute limbs, as he sat down, inclined the guest to laughter. Mr.  Lincoln disposed of his request at once, and manifested a desire to  talk. So he"]]]
