May the nine great Gods forgive me! but he who is in  there is loving, pious and brave, and pleases me--and thou, thou,  who didst think yesterday to purge away the taint of his touch with a  word--what prompts thee today to cast him with the lepers?\"    \"The admonition of an enlightened man, never to give up any link of  the old institutions; because thereby the already weakened chain may be  broken, and fall rattling to the ground.\"    \"Then thou condemnest me to uncleanness for the sake of all old  superstition, and of the populace, but not for my actions? Thou art  silent? Answer me now, if thou art such a one as I took the for, freely  and sincerely; for it concerns the peace of my soul.\" Pentaur breathed  hard; and then from the depths of his soul, tormented by doubts, these  deeply-felt words forced themselves as if wrung from him; at first  softly, but louder as he went on.    \"Thou dost compel me to say what I had better not even think; but rather  will I sin against obedience than against truth, the pure daughter  of the Sun, whose aspect, Bent-Anat, thou dost wear. Whether the  paraschites is unclean by birth or not, who am I that I should decide?  But to me this man appeared--as to thee--as one moved by the same pure  and holy emotions as stir and bless me and mine, and thee and every  soul born of woman; and I believe that the impressions of this hour have  touched thy soul as well as mine, not to taint, but to purify. If I am  wrong, may the many-named Gods forgive me, Whose breath lives and works  in the paraschites as well as in thee and me, in Whom I believe, and to  Whom I will ever address my humble songs, louder and more joyfully, as I  learn that all that lives and breathes, that weeps and rejoices, is the  image of their sublime nature, and born to equal joy and equal sorrow.\"    Pentaur had raised his eyes to heaven; now they met the proud and joyful  radiance of the princess' glance, while she frankly offered him her  hand. He humbly kissed her robe, but she said:    \"Nay--not so. Lay thy hand in blessing on mine. Thou art a man and a  true priest. Now I can be satisfied to be regarded as unclean, for my  father also desires that, by us especially, the institutions of the past  that have so long continued should be respected, for the sake of the  people. Let us pray in common to the Gods, that these poor people may  be released from the old ban. How beautiful the world might be, if men  would but let man remain what the Celestials have made him. But Paaker  and poor Nefert are waiting in the scorching sun-come, follow me.\"    She went forward, but after a few steps she turned round to him, and  asked:    \"What is thy name?\"    \"Pentaur.\"    \"Thou then art the poet of the House of Seti?\"    \"They call me so.\"    Bent-Anat stood still a moment, gazing full at him as at a kinsman whom  we meet for the first time face to face, and said:    \"The Gods have given thee great gifts, for thy glance reaches farther  and pierces deeper than that of other men; and thou canst say in words  what we can only feel--I follow thee willingly!\"    Pentaur blushed like a boy, and said, while Paaker and Nefert came  nearer to them:    \"Till to-day life lay before me as if in twilight; but this moment shows  it me in another light. I have seen its deepest shadows; and,\" he added  in a low tone \"how glorious its light can be.\"          CHAPTER VII.    An hour later, Bent-Anat and her train of followers stood before the  gate of the House of Seti.    Swift as a ball thrown from a man's hand, a runner had sprung forward  and hurried on to announce the approach of the princess to the  chief priest. She stood alone in her chariot, in advance of all her  companions, for Pentaur had found a place with Paaker. At the gate of  the temple they were met by the head of the haruspices.    The great doors of the pylon were wide open, and afforded a view into  the forecourt of the sanctuary, paved with polished squares of  stone, and surrounded on three sides with colonnades. The walls and  architraves, the pillars and the fluted cornice, which slightly curved  in over the court, were gorgeous with many colored figures and painted  decorations. In the middle stood a great sacrificial altar, on which  burned logs of cedar wood, whilst fragrant balls of Kyphi       [Kyphi was a celebrated Egyptian incense. Recipes for its     preparation have been preserved in the papyrus of Ebers, in the     laboratories of the temples, and elsewhere. Parthey had three     different varieties prepared by the chemist, L. Voigt, in Berlin.     Kyphi after the formula of Dioskorides was the best. It consisted     of rosin, wine, rad, galangae, juniper berries, the root of the     aromatic rush, asphalte, mastic, myrrh, Burgundy grapes, and honey.]    were consumed by the flames, filling the wide space with their heavy  perfume. Around, in semi-circular array, stood more than a hundred  white-robed priests, who all turned to face the approaching princess,  and sang heart-rending songs of lamentation.    Many of the inhabitants of the Necropolis had collected on either side  of the lines of sphinxes, between which the princess drove up to the  Sanctuary. But none asked what these songs of lamentation might signify,  for about this sacred place lamentation and mystery for ever lingered.  \"Hail to the child of Rameses!\"--\"All hail to the daughter of the Sun!\"  rang from a thousand throats; and the assembled multitude bowed almost  to the earth at the approach of the royal maiden.    At the pylon, the princess descended from her chariot, and preceded by  the chief of the haruspices, who had gravely and silently greeted her,  passed on to the door of the temple. But as she prepared to cross the  forecourt, suddenly, without warning, the priests' chant swelled to a  terrible, almost thundering loudness, the clear, shrill voice of the  Temple scholars rising in passionate lament, supported by the deep and  threatening roll of the basses.    Bent-Anat started and checked her steps. Then she walked on again.    But on the threshold of the door, Ameni, in full pontifical robes, stood  before her in the way, his crozier extended as though to forbid her  entrance.    \"The advent of the daughter of Rameses in her purity,\" he cried in loud  and passionate tones, \"augurs blessing to this sanctuary; but this  abode of the Gods closes its portals on the unclean, be they slaves or  princes. In the name of the Immortals, from whom thou art descended, I  ask thee, Bent-Anat, art thou clean, or hast thou, through the touch of  the unclean, defiled thyself and contaminated thy royal hand?\"    Deep scarlet flushed the maiden's cheeks, there was a rushing sound in  her ears as of a stormy sea surging close beside her, and her bosom rose  and fell in passionate emotion. The kingly blood in her veins boiled  wildly; she felt that an unworthy part had been assigned to her in  a carefully-premeditated scene; she forgot her resolution to accuse  herself of uncleanness, and already her lips were parted in vehement  protest against the priestly assumption that so deeply stirred her  to rebellion, when Ameni, who placed himself directly in front of the  Princess, raised his eyes, and turned them full upon her with all the  depths of their indwelling earnestness.    The words died away, and Bent-Anat stood silent, but she endured the  gaze, and returned it proudly and defiantly.    The blue veins started in Ameni's forehead; yet he repressed the  resentment which was gathering like thunder clouds in his soul, and  said, with a voice that gradually deviated more and more from its usual  moderation:    \"For the second time the Gods demand through me, their representative:  Hast thou entered this holy place in order that the Celestials may purge  thee of the defilement that stains thy body and soul?\"    \"My father will communicate the answer to thee,\" replied Bent-Anat  shortly and proudly.    \"Not to me,\" returned Ameni, \"but to the Gods, in whose name I now  command thee to quit this sanctuary, which is defiled by thy presence.\"    Bent-Anat's whole form quivered. \"I will go,\" she said with sullen  dignity.    She turned to recross the gateway of the Pylon. At the first step her  glance met the eye of the poet. As one to whom it is vouchsafed to stand  and gaze at some great prodigy, so Pentaur had stood opposite the royal  maiden, uneasy and yet fascinated, agitated, yet with secretly uplifted  soul. Her deed seemed to him of boundless audacity, and yet one suited  to her true and noble nature. By her side, Ameni, his revered and  admired master, sank into insignificance; and when she turned to leave  the temple, his hand was raised indeed to hold her back, but as his  glance met hers, his hand refused its office, and sought instead to  still the throbbing of his overflowing heart.    The experienced priest, meanwhile, read the features of these two  guileless beings like an open book. A quickly-formed tie, he felt,  linked their souls, and the look which he saw them exchange startled  him. The rebellious princess had glanced at the poet as though claiming  approbation for her triumph, and Pentaur's eyes had responded to the  appeal.    One instant Ameni paused. Then he cried: \"Bent-Anat!\"    The princess turned to the priest, and looked at him gravely and  enquiringly.    Ameni took a step forward, and stood between her and the poet.    \"Thou wouldst challenge the Gods to combat,\" he said sternly. \"That is  bold; but such daring it seems to me has grown up in thee because thou  canst count on an ally, who stands scarcely farther from the Immortals  than I myself. Hear this:--to thee, the misguided child, much may be  forgiven. But a servant of the Divinity,\" and with these words he turned  a threatening glance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#18)"],[1," papyrus hung  against the walls and threw a strange light on the scene, something like  that when the sun's rays strike through colored glass. The space  between the columns and the walls was filled with choice plants, palms,  oleanders, pomegranates, oranges and roses, behind which an invisible  band of harp and flute-players was stationed, who received the guests  with strains of monotonous, solemn music.    The floor of this hall was paved in black and white, and in the middle  stood elegant tables covered with dishes of all kinds, cold roast meats,  sweets, well-arranged baskets of fruit and cake, golden jugs of wine,  glass drinking-cups and artistic flower-vases.    A multitude of richly-dressed slaves under direction of the  high-steward, busied themselves in handing these dishes to the  guests, who, either standing around, or reclining on sumptuous seats,  entertained themselves in conversation with their friends.    Both sexes and all ages were to be found in this assembly. As the women  entered, they received charming little nosegays from the young priests  in the personal service of the king, and many a youth of high degree  appeared in the hall with flowers, which he not only offered to her he  loved best, but held up for her to smell.    The Egyptian men, who were dressed as we have already seen them at  the reception of the Persian embassy, behaved towards the women with a  politeness that might almost be termed submissive. Among the latter few  could pretend to remarkable beauty, though there were many bewitching  almond-shaped eyes, whose loveliness was heightened by having their lids  dyed with the eye-paint called \"mestem.\" The majority wore their hair  arranged in the same manner; the wealth of waving brown locks floated  back over the shoulders and was brushed behind the ears, one braid being  left on each side to hang over the temples to the breast. A broad diadem  confined these locks, which as the maids knew, were quite as often the  wig-maker's work as Nature's. Many ladies of the court wore above their  foreheads a lotus-flower, whose stem drooped on the hair at the back.    They carried fans of bright feathers in their delicate hands. These  were loaded with rings; the finger-nails were stained red, according to  Egyptian custom, and gold or silver bands were worn above the elbow, and  at the wrists and ankles.       [This custom (of staining finger-nails) is still prevalent in the     East; the plant Shenna, Laosonia spinosa, called by Pliny XIII.     Cyprus, being used for the purpose. The Egyptian government has     prohibited the dye, but it will be difficult to uproot the ancient     custom. The pigment for coloring the eyelids, mentioned in the     text, is also still employed. The Papyrus Ebers alludes to the     Arabian kohl or antimony, which is frequently mentioned under the     name of \"mestem\" on monuments belonging to the time of the     Pharaohs.]    Their robes were beautiful and costly, and in many cases so cut as to  leave the right breast uncovered. Bartja, the young Persian prince,  among the men, and Nitetis, the Pharaoh's daughter, among the women,  were equally conspicuous for their superior beauty, grace and charms.  The royal maiden wore a transparent rose-colored robe, in her black hair  were fresh roses, she walked by the side of her sister, the two robed  alike, but Nitetis pale as the lotus-flower in her mother's hair.    Ladice, the queen, by birth a Greek, and daughter of Battus of Cyrene,  walked by the side of Amasis and presented the young Persians to her  children. A light lace robe was thrown over her garment of purple,  embroidered with gold; and on her beautiful Grecian head she wore the  Urmus serpent, the ornament peculiar to Egyptian queens.    Her countenance was noble yet charming, and every movement betrayed the  grace only to be imparted by a Greek education.    Amasis, in making choice of this queen, after the death of his second  wife, (the Egyptian Tentcheta, mother of Psamtik the heir to the  throne,) had followed his prepossession in favor of the Greek nation and  defied the wrath of the priests.    The two girls at Ladice's side, Tachot and Nitetis, were called  twin-sisters, but showed no signs of that resemblance usually to be  found in twins.    Tachot was a fair, blue-eyed girl, small, and delicately built; Nitetis,  on the other hand, tall and majestic, with black hair and eyes, evinced  in every action that she was of royal blood.    \"How pale thou look'st, my child!\" said Ladice, kissing Nitetis' cheek.  \"Be of good courage, and meet thy future bravely. Here is the noble  Bartja, the brother of thy future husband.\"    Nitetis raised her dark, thoughtful eyes and fixed them long and  enquiringly on the beautiful youth. He bowed low before the blushing  maiden, kissed her garment, and said:    \"I salute thee, as my future queen and sister! I can believe that  thy heart is sore at parting from thy home, thy parents, brethren and  sisters; but be of good courage; thy husband is a great hero, and  a powerful king; our mother is the noblest of women, and among the  Persians the beauty and virtue of woman is as much revered as the  life-giving light of the sun. Of thee, thou sister of the lily Nitetis,  whom, by her side I might venture to call the rose, I beg forgiveness,  for robbing thee of thy dearest friend.\"    As he said these words he looked eagerly into Tachot's beautiful blue  eyes; she bent low, pressing her hand upon her heart, and gazed on him  long after Amasis had drawn him away to a seat immediately opposite  the dancing-girls, who were just about to display their skill for the  entertainment of the guests. A thin petticoat was the only clothing  of these girls, who threw and wound their flexible limbs to a measure  played on harp and tambourine. After the dance appeared Egyptian singers  and buffoons for the further amusement of the company.    At length some of the courtiers forsook the hall, their grave demeanor  being somewhat overcome by intoxication.       [Unfortunately women, as well as men, are to be seen depicted on the     monuments in an intoxicated condition. One man is being carried     home, like a log of wood, on the heads of his servants. Wilkinson     II. 168. Another is standing on his head II. 169. and several     ladies are in the act of returning the excessive quantity which they     have drunk. Wilkinson II. 167. At the great Techu-festival at     Dendera intoxication seems to have been as much commanded as at the     festivals of Dionysus under the Ptolemies, one of whom (Ptolemy     Dionysus) threatened those who remained sober with the punishment of     death. But intoxication was in general looked upon by the Egyptians     as a forbidden and despicable vice. In the Papyrus Anastasi IV.,     for instance, we read these words on a drunkard: \"Thou art as a     sanctuary without a divinity, as a house without bread,\" and     further: \"How carefully should men avoid beer (hek).\" A number of     passages in the Papyrus denounce drunkards.]    The women were carried home in gay litters by slaves with torches; and  only the highest military commanders, the Persian ambassadors and a  few officials, especial friends of Amasis, remained behind. These  were retained by the master of the ceremonies, and conducted to a  richly-ornamented saloon, where a gigantic wine-bowl standing on a table  adorned in the Greek fashion, invited to a drinking-bout.    Amasis was seated on a high arm-chair at the head of the table; at his  left the youthful Bartja, at his right the aged Croesus. Besides these  and the other Persians, Theodorus and Ibykus, the friends of Polykrates,  already known to us, and Aristomachus, now commander of the Greek  body-guard, were among the king's guests.    Amasis, whom we have just heard in such grave discourse with Croesus,  now indulged in jest and satire. He seemed once more the wild officer,  the bold reveller of the olden days.    His sparkling, clever jokes, at times playful, at times scornful, flew  round among the revellers. The guests responded in loud, perhaps often  artificial laughter, to their king's jokes, goblet after goblet was  emptied, and the rejoicings had reached their highest point, when  suddenly the master of the ceremonies appeared, bearing a small gilded  mummy; and displaying it to the gaze of the assembly, exclaimed. \"Drink,  jest, and be merry, for all too soon ye shall become like unto this!\"       [Wilkinson gives drawings of these mummies (II. 410.) hundreds of     which were placed in the tombs, and have been preserved to us.     Lucian was present at a banquet, when they were handed round. The     Greeks seem to have adopted this custom, but with their usual talent     for beautifying all they touched, substituted a winged figure of     death for the mummy. Maxims similar to the following one are by no     means rare. \"Cast off all care; be mindful only of pleasure until     the day cometh when then must depart on the journey, whose goal is     the realm of silence!\" Copied from the tomb of Neferhotep to     Abd-el-Qurnah.]    \"Is it your custom thus to introduce death at all your banquets?\" said  Bartja, becoming serious, \"or is this only a jest devised for to-day by  your master of the ceremonies?\"    \"Since the earliest ages,\" answered Amasis, \"it has been our custom to  display these mummies at banquets, in order to increase the mirth of the  revellers, by reminding them that one must enjoy the time while it is  here. Thou, young butterfly, hast still many a long and joyful year  before thee; but we, Croesus, we old men, must hold by this firmly. Fill  the goblets, cup-bearer, let not one moment of our lives be wasted! Thou  canst drink well, thou golden-haired Persian! Truly the great gods have  endowed thee not only with beautiful eyes, and blooming beauty, but with  a good throat! Let me embrace thee, thou glorious youth, thou rogue!  What"]]]
