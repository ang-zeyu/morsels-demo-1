These facts shown, any magistrate before whom he might be  taken, must let him go at once. I thought, perhaps, if I waited a few  hours where I was, he would be sure to rejoin me, and we could then  return to Port Jervis without Sarah's son to be sure; but, otherwise, no  worse off than we were when we set out on this ill-starred expedition  in the morning.    All this seemed so plain to me that I sent over to Belvidere for a  lawyer, who soon came across the bridge to see me, and to him I narrated  the whole circumstances of the case from, beginning to end. I asked him  if I had not a right to carry off the boy whom I knew to be my own? His  reply was that he would not stop to discuss that question; all he knew  was that there was a great hue and cry after me for kidnapping the boy;  that my son was seized and held for aiding and abetting in the attempted  abduction; and he advised me, as a friend, to leave that part of the  country as soon as possible. I gave him fifty dollars to look after  Henry's case. He thought, considering how little, and that little  involuntarily, my son had to do with the matter, he might be got off; he  would do all he could for him anyhow. He then returned to Belvidere, and  I took the road north.    When I arrived at Port Jervis I detailed to my landlord the whole  occurrences of the day--what I had tried to do, and how miserably I had  failed, and asked him what was to be done next. He said \"nothing;\" we  could only wait and see what happened.    The day following I received a letter from the Belvidere lawyer  informing me that Henry had been examined, had been bound over in  the sum of three hundred dollars to take his trial on a charge of  kidnapping, and he was then in the county jail. I at once showed this  letter to the landlord, and he offered to go down with another man to  Belvidere and see about the bail. I gave him three hundred dollars,  which he took with him and put into the bands of a resident there who  became bail, and in a day or two Henry came back with them to Port  Jervis.    My son was frantic; he had been roughly treated; and to think, he said,  that he should be thrust into the common jail and kept there two days  with all sorts of scoundrels, when he had done actually nothing! He  would go back there, stand his trial, and prove his innocence, if  he died for it. He reproached me for attempting to carry off the boy  against his advice and warning; he knew we should into trouble; but he  would show them that he had nothing to do with it; that's what he would  do.    Now this was precisely what I did not wish to have him do. A trial of  this case, even if Henry should come off scott free, would be certain to  revive the whole of the old Scheimer story, which had nearly died away,  and which I had no desire to have brought before the public again in  any way whatever. The bail bond I was willing, eager even to forfeit, if  that would end the matter. But Henry was sure they couldn't touch him,  and he meant to have the three hundred dollars returned to me.    Seeing how sensitive the boy was on the subject, and how bent he was  on proving his innocence, I thought it best to draw him away from the  immediate locality, and so, in the course of a week, I persuaded him to  go to New York with me, and we afterward went to Maine for a few weeks  to sell my medicines. This Maine trip was a most lucrative one, which  was very fortunate, for the money I made there, to the amount of  several hundred dollars, was shortly needed for purposes which I did not  anticipate when I put the money by.    We returned to New York, and I supposed that Henry had given up all idea  of attempting to \"prove his innocence;\" indeed we had no conversation  about the kidnapping affair for several weeks. But he slipped away from  me. One day I came back to the hotel, and, inquiring for him, was told  at the office he had left word for me that he had gone to Belvidere. A  letter from him a day or two afterward confirmed this, to me, unhappy  intelligence. The time was near at hand for his trial, and he had gone  and given himself up to the authorities. He wrote to me again that he  had sent word about his situation to his mother--my first and worst  wife--and she and his sister were already with him.    Of course it was impossible for me to go there, if there were no other  reasons, I was too immediately interested in this affair to be present,  and I had no idea of undergoing a trial and a certain conviction for  myself. But I sent down a New York lawyer with one hundred dollars,  directing him to employ council there, and to advise and assist as much  as he could. Meanwhile, I remained in New York, anxious, it is true, yet  almost certain that it would be impossible, under the circumstances, to  convict Henry of the kidnapping for which he was indicted. He had not  even assisted in the affair, and was sure his counsel would be able to  so convince the court and jury.    And reviewing the whole matter, now in my cooler moments, this scheme of  trying to carry away Sarah's son, seemed to be as foolish, useless, and  mad, as any one of my marrying adventures. Till I picked him out from  among his schoolmates, I had never seen the child at all. When I started  from Port Jervis to go down, as I supposed, into Pennsylvania, I had no  more idea of kidnapping the boy than I had of robbing a sheep-fold.  It was only when the landlord at Water Gap told me that Sarah had  remarried, and was wedded to a worthless, drunken husband, that I  conceived the plan of removing the boy from such associations. I was  going to bring him up in a respectable manner. Alas! I did not succeed  even in bringing him away.        CHAPTER XIII. ANOTHER WIDOW.    WAITING FOR THE VERDICT--MY SON SENT TO STATE PRISON--WHAT SARAH WOULD  HAVE DONE--INTERVIEW WITH MY FIRST WIFE--HELP FOR HENRY--THE BIDDEFORD  WIDOW--HER EFFORT TO MARRY ME--OUR VISIT TO BOSTON--A WARNING--A  GENEROUS GIFT--HENRY PARDONED--CLOSE OF THE SCHEIMER ACCOUNT--VISIT TO  ONTARIO COUNTY--MY RICH COUSINS--WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN--MY BIRTH--PLACE  REVISITED.        I waited with nervous impatience for the close of the trial in New  Jersey, when I hoped to welcome my son Henry to New York. It was  so plain a case, as it seemed to me, and must appear, I thought, to  everybody, that I hardly doubted his instant acquittal. But very shortly  the New York lawyer whom I had sent to Belvidere, came back and brought  terrible news. Henry had been tried, and notwithstanding the fairest  showing in his favor, he was convicted and sentenced to eighteen months  imprisonment at Trenton.    As it appeared, it was I really, and not Henry, who was on trial. The  circumstances of the desperate struggle, and my knocking down one of  the men with the butt of my whip, were conspicuous in the case. Even  the little boy was put on the stand, and was made to testify against his  older half-brother. Henry himself was astounded at the result of the  trial, and was firmly convinced that instead of \"proving his innocence\"  to Jersey jurymen, he had better have let his innocence go by default.  We never even got back again the three hundred dollars which had been  put into the hands of the man who went bail for Henry when he was bound  over for trial. For us, it was bad business from beginning to end.    Henry wrote a letter to me, that just before his trial, before he had  delivered himself up, and while he was still under bail, he had gone to  see Sarah Scheimer on the little farm which was bought with her money,  and was worked, so far as it was worked at all, by her drunken husband.  The family were even poorer than the landlord at Water Gap had reported.  Sarah herself was miserable and unhappy. She told Henry, when he  informed her who he was, that if I had wanted to see her or her son, I  should have been welcome. She would have been very glad to have had me  take the boy and clothe him decently; but she could not part with him,  and would not have let me take him away; still, I could see him at any  time, and as often as I liked, and the boy should grow up to know and to  look upon me as his father.    And this, really, was all I desired, all I wanted; and it was all easily  within my grasp, ready in fact to be put into my hands, and I had gone  ahead in my usual mad, blundering way, acting, not only without advice,  but against such advice as came from Henry at the last moment, and had  alienated the mother from me, lost the boy, and had sent Henry, who was  wholly innocent, to state prison for eighteen months.    The poor fellow was take to Trenton and was put into the prison where  I had spent seven months. He was almost crazy when he got there. His  mother and sister went with him, and took lodgings in the place so as to  be near him, to render him any assistance that might be in their power.    I had been idle now for some weeks in New York, and I went back to  Maine, to Biddeford, where I lad a good practice. I picked up a good  deal of money, and in two months I returned to New York to make a brief  visit, and to see if something could not be done for the release of  Henry from prison. At my solicitation a friend of mine wrote to  Trenton to Henry's mother to come on to New York, and meet me at the  Metropolitan Hotel on a specified day, to transact some business. She  came, and we met for the first time in several years. We met now simply  on business, and there was no expression of sentiment or feeling on  either side. We cared nothing for each other. I commended her for her  devotion to Henry, and then told her I believed, if the proper efforts  were made, he could be pardoned out of prison. I told her what lawyer  and other persons to see, and how to proceed in the matter. I gave her  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#18)"],[1,"Heaven! but it is strange--wonderful, that fate  should have thrown him and Helen Huntington together again, and that  neither should know the other; and yet not so very strange, for she was  but eight years old when Charles ran away. Yes, he thwarted me then, for  even in childhood the girl fancied him above me, and now she affects him  even in his fallen fortunes.\"    \"What shall we do, sir, now that master Charles has turned up again?\"  asked Leonard Hust, in his simplicity. \"We cannot testify against him  now, sir.\"    \"No, no, no!\" said the elder brother, hastily, \"he must not be further  examined.\"    \"How he has altered, sir, only to think,\" continued the servant; \"why,  when he went away from Bramble Park, sir, he wasn't much more than nine  years old.\"    \"Yes. I remember, I remember, Leonard,\" replied his master, hurriedly,  while he walked the apartment with quick, irregular steps. \"I remember  only too well.\"    This was indeed that elder brother who had, when a boy, so oppressed, so  worried, and rendered miserable his brother Charles, as to cause him in  a fit of desperation to stray away from home, whither he knew not. His  parents saw now--alas! too late--their fatal error; but the boy was  gone, no tidings could be had of him, and they believed him dead. The  honest tar, whose yarn the attentive reader will remember, as given on  the deck of the \"Sea Witch,\" spoke truly of his commander. He had, years  before, strayed alongside a vessel, as has been related, from whence he  hardly knew himself, or was afraid to say. Hunger and neglect even then  had greatly changed him, and he shipped, as has been related. The fall  he got at sea threw a cloud over his brain as to past recollections up  to that time, and here if the wish ever possessed him as to returning to  his early home, he knew naught of it.    When he heard the voice of Leonard Hust in the court, it seemed to  strike upon some string in memory's harp, which vibrated to old familiar  recollections, and the more he heard him speak the more the sensation  came over him which led to the demonstrations which we have already  witnessed. And yet he could not recall aught that would serve him as a  clue--the early injury to his brain seemed to have obliterated the  connecting links that memory could not supply. The reason, probably, why  the servant's voice and not the brother's thus recalled him was, that  the former had been kind, and his voice had ever sounded like music in  the neglected boy's ears, but the brother's voice had never had that  charm or happy association connected with it. As to little cousin  Helen,--as she was then called,--it was not strange that Miss  Huntington, after years of estrangement in India, meeting him under such  circumstances, himself so changed, should not have recalled enough of  the past to recognize him; and yet we have seen that at times she dwelt  upon the tender accents of his voice like sleeping memories, herself  quite ignorant of the cause of this peculiar influence.    She was now with her mother on shore at the mission house, in an agony  of suspense as to the result of the trial which was taking place. She  feared the worst, for Captain Bramble had taken measures to instruct  those about her to their effect that the prisoner would be found guilty,  and either strung cup by the neck at once, or be sent home to England  for the same purpose. Mrs. Huntington felt sad and borne down by the  position of affairs--for although she did not understand her daughter's  sentiments towards Captain Ratlin, yet she recognized the fact of her  and her child's indebtedness to him, and that he had evinced the  characteristics of a gentleman.    \"Mother, if they find Captain Ratlin guilty, what can they, what will  they do with him?\" asked Helen Huntington anxiously of her mother, on  the day of the trial.    \"Why, my dear, it is terrible to think of, but the penalty of such a  crime as is charged to him, is death; but we must hope for the best,  and--why Helen, how pale you look!\"    \"It was only a passing spasm, mother. I am--I believe I am already  better,\" said the daughter, in an agony of suffering that she dared not  evince.    \"Come, Helen, lean on me and go to your bed for a while; these sudden  changes and so much exposure has rendered you weak. Come, my dear,  come.\"    And the poor girl, all trembling and pale, suffered her mother to lead  her to her chamber, where a gentle anodyne soothed her nerves, and she  soon fell to sleep. Had her mother not been little better than blind,  she would have easily read her daughter's heart, and have seen that she  loved with all her woman's soul the man who was that day on trial for  his life. What mattered it to her that he was nameless, a wanderer, a  slaver? She loved him, and that covered each and all faults, however  heinous in the sight of the law. She felt that it was not the outward  associations which made a man. She had looked beneath the surface of his  soul, and had seen the pure crystal depth of his manly heart--frank,  open, and as truthful as day itself. To her he was noble, chivalric and  true, and if all the world had blamed him, if all had called him guilty,  her bosom would have been open to receive him!    Could he have realized this as he lay in chains on board his elder  brother's ship--could he have known that he was really loved by that  fair, sweet and gentle creature, how it would have lightened the weight  of the iron bands he bore--how cheered his drooping spirits.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE BROTHERS.      Now commenced a struggle in the bosom of Robert Bramble. It was some  hours before he could recover from the first blush of amazement at the  strange discovery he had made. Not to have had something of a brother's  feelings come over him at such a time, he must have been less than  human; and it was between the promptings of blood, of early  recollections of childhood, before he grew to that age when his  disposition, ruined by indulgence, had led him so bitterly to oppress  and injure his brother as to drive him from the home of their youth, and  the recollection of those little more matured years, when jealousy at  his superior aptness, strength, and success with \"cousin Helen,\" had  made him hate him.    It was impossible for the man to forget the bitterness of the child;  besides, had not the same spirit of rivalry ripened, until he found his  brother in manhood still his successful rival with Helen Huntington? The  reader will remember that they had all three been children together, and  that the last time Charles had looked back at his home, as he started  away from it, his eye detected the little form of Helen, where she stood  gazing after him.    If there had been any better promptings in the heart of Robert Bramble,  they would have turned the balance in favor of his brother, and he would  have befriended him; but this he did not do. He walked his room,  bitterly musing upon the singular position of affairs, while he knew  very well that Charles lay in chains on board his ship in the harbor.  Then he recalled the memory of his parents, as connected with this state  of affairs. The father was dead, the mother, a weak-minded woman, was  also bowed by ill-health; indeed, their early lives had few happy  associations. Robert himself had embittered all its relations.    It was nearly midnight, and the moon had sunk behind the hill that  sheltered the harbor on the north, leaving the dark water of the bay in  deep shadow. At long gunshot from the shore lay the ship in which  Charles Bramble was confined. All was still as death, save the pace of  the sentinel in the ship's waist, and a ripple now and then of tide-way  against the ship's cable. An observant eye, from the leeward side of the  ship, might have seen a dark form creep out from one of the quarter  ports, and gradually make its way along the moulding of the water-lines  toward the larboard bow ports, one of which it stealthily entered.    Entering with this figure, we shall soon find it to be Leonard Hust, who  now, watching an opportunity, slipped into the apartment where the young  commander had been confined since he left the factory of Don Leonardo.  No sooner was the door closed quietly, so as to avoid the observation of  the watch between decks, than the new comer opened a secret lantern and  discovered himself to the prisoner, at the same time cautioning him to  silence.    \"Who are you?\" coolly asked Charles Bramble, for thus we must know him  in future.    \"Leonard Hust,\" was the reply; \"your friend, as I will soon prove.\"    \"But it is only a few hours since you were giving witness against me.\"    \"That is true; but bless you, sir, there has been a great change in  matters since that.\"    \"So I thought, by the movements I observed, though I did not understand  them.\"    \"Hist! speak low, sir,\" said the other, \"and while I am talking to you,  just let me, at the same time, be filing off these steel ornaments upon  your wrists!\"    \"File them off? Well, then, you must, indeed, be a friend,\" said the  prisoner.    \"Leave me to prove that. Sit here, so the light will fall on them, with  your back this way, that will keep the light from showing between decks.  So, that is it.\"    \"But what was it made your voice and the sound of your name affect me so  this morning? I could not divest myself of the feeling that, I had heard  it somewhere before.\"    \"Heard it? bless you, sir, I rather think you have heard it before,\"  said the fellow, as he worked industriously with his file upon the  handcuffs.    \"Well, where, and when; and under what circumstances?\" asked the  prisoner, curiously.    \"That is just what I am going to tell you, sir; and you see, master  Charles--\"    \"Master Charles,--Charles,--why do you call me that name?\"    \"Why, you see, that is your name, to be sure. Charles Bramble, and you  are Captain Robert Bramble's brother, and--take care, hold still, or"]]]
