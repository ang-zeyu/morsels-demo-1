The early part of April, 1837, Wilford Woodruff devoted himself to the  meetings which were held in the Temple during those days. Those who  were absent from Kirtland in the spring of 1836, and had not therefore  the privilege of receiving their endowments at that time were granted  the opportunity to do so in the following spring. This was another  blessing that he received with feelings of gratitude and praise to his  Maker. The influence of the Temple ordinances is, perhaps, the most  potent of any influence in the Church in the establishment of union, in  the perpetuity of brotherly love, and in the preservation of a God-like  purity. It is not too much to say that one, upon whom the spirit of  these ordinances has fastened itself, never escapes in his conscience  the sacred obligations they impose upon him.    Referring to the administration of the Temple ordinances on that  occasion, he writes in his journal: \"The Prophet Joseph arose and  addressed the congregation for the space of three hours. He was  clothed with the power, spirit, and image of God. He presented many  things of great importance to the elders of Israel. O, that the record  could be written as with an iron pen, of the {67} light, principles,  and virtue that came from the mouth and heart of the Prophet Joseph,  whose soul, like that of Enoch, seemed as wide as eternity! That day  strikingly demonstrated that he was, indeed, a prophet of God raised  up for the deliverance of Israel. He presented to us a plan of the  city of Kirtland which was given him by vision. The future will prove  that the visions of Joseph concerning Jackson County and concerning  the various stakes of Zion will be fulfilled in the time appointed of  the Lord. After his remarks, the Sacrament was administered and all  were made glad at the table of the Lord in association with apostles,  prophets, patriarchs, evangelists, and teachers. In the evening a  meeting was held in which many took part by speaking in tongues, giving  the interpretations thereof, prophesying, etc.,--a veritable feast of  Pentecost.\"    Temple work in Kirtland in the early part of 1837 afforded him that  spiritual satisfaction which was so helpful in those subsequent years  of his life when he was employed in missionary service and upon the  plains as a pioneer. He also learned during those days in Kirtland  that the more remarkable the spiritual manifestations, the greater the  opposition of the evil one. He was present at the Sunday services in  the Temple, April 9th, when Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, and Sidney  Rigdon laid before the Saints the condition of the Church respecting  temporal affairs.    A financial panic was on throughout the United States. Its depressing  influence was severely felt in Kirtland. Before it reached that  place, however, many of the leading brethren had given their time and  talent to speculation and were absorbed in schemes detrimental to  their religious standing, and quite contrary to the counsel of the  Prophet. Speculations brought on jealousies and hatreds, and those evil  attributes manifested themselves toward Joseph who sought so diligently  to suppress them. Prominent men--men who had shown the highest  degree of loyalty to the Prophet became disaffected. Their financial  speculations brought on a spirit of self-sufficiency, and that spirit  made them wise in their own conceit. The affairs of the Church were put  to the test of \"wisdom\"--wisdom as they understood it. Such wisdom,  however, was undermining their integrity to the Church. The meek and  humble maintained their fidelity and brought encouragement {68} and  solace to the Prophet, and the noble men who stood with him in the  hours of financial distress.    On one occasion he met Wilford Woodruff, and after scrutinizing him  very closely as though he were reading his inmost thoughts, said:  \"Brother Woodruff, I am glad to see you. I hardly know when I meet  those who have been my brethren in the Lord, who of them are my  friends. They have become so scarce.\" Elder Woodruff felt throughout  all the subsequent years of his life a supreme satisfaction over the  loyalty he had manifested in those trying times to the Prophet of God.  Elder Woodruff was so faithful in the discharge of his duties, so  humble in his demeanor, so sincere and devoted that he was rewarded by  a discerning spirit which kept him in the path of safety when some of  his brethren were struggling in the meshes of misgivings and doubt.    The correctness of Wilford Woodruff's attitude in those days was  manifested in his ability to see in the Prophet the same spiritual  power that had been manifested to him on former occasions. Of a meeting  held on April 19th, when the Prophet spoke, he writes: \"He seemed  a fountain of knowledge from whose mouth streams of eternal wisdom  flowed. As he stood before the people, he showed clearly that the  authority of God was upon him. When speaking of those who professed to  be his friends and the friends of humanity, but who had turned against  the people and opposed the prosperity of Kirtland, he declared the Lord  would deal severely with them. Joseph uttered the feelings of his soul  in pain, while reviewing the poverty and afflictions of his people,  and while finding false brethren whose course brought peril upon the  Saints. Joseph is a father to Ephraim and to all Israel in these last  days; and he mourned because of unbelief and treachery among many who  had embraced the gospel. He feared lest few in Kirtland should remain  worthy to receive an inheritance.\"    \"There is not so great a man as Joseph standing in this generation,\"  he wrote later on. \"The Gentiles look upon him, and he is like a bed  of gold concealed from human view. They know not his principle, his  spirit, his wisdom, his virtue, his philanthropy, of his calling. His  mind, like Enoch's, expands as eternity, and God alone can comprehend  his soul.\"    Misfortune and affliction so often unsettle men's minds and {69} move  them from their moorings that they are prone to doubt the goodness of  God and His protecting care over them. The highest type of saintly life  and divine loyalty among men, alike in affliction and prosperity, was  Job. Job was one of those beautiful characters in Old Testament history  that appealed strongly to the mind and heart of Wilford Woodruff. His  reference to Job in public discourses shows how deeply that worthy  character of Holy Writ had influenced his life.    At the time herein mentioned, Wilford had reached his 30th year. He  now felt that it was his duty to assume the responsibility of husband  and father. He was, no doubt, strongly actuated in this feeling by an  inspiration which the new-found message brought to his soul. On the  13th day of April, 1837, he received in wedlock Miss Phoebe Whitmore  Carter, an estimable young lady from the state of Maine. She was the  daughter of Ezra Carter of Scarboro. With other members of her father's  household, she had been baptized some time previously by Elder John  F. Boynton. Like her husband, she belonged to that sturdy New England  race that gave strength and force to the new movement. They had been  acquainted only about two months when they joined hands in holy  wedlock. The ceremony was performed by President Frederick G. Williams.  The Prophet Joseph had intended to marry them, but owing to severe  persecution, he was compelled to be absent from home.    She had already received her patriarchal blessing from Father Joseph  Smith on November 10, 1836. It contained many glorious promises which,  so far as they related to this life, have been fulfilled. Some were  fulfilled in a remarkable manner.    On the 15th of April, two days subsequent to their marriage, Elder  Woodruff likewise received his patriarchal blessing. These blessings  gave hope and courage to the new life which they were hereafter to  experience together. Such a blessing brought joys and assurances  greatly in excess of those which came from wedding tours. They  therefore began life together in faith and in perfect reliance upon the  goodness of God. Elder Woodruff's blessing contained the promise that  he should bring all of his relatives into the Church. The fulfillment  of that promise was realized in a remarkable manner, and was one of  those evidences which gave him support and comfort throughout all the  subsequent years of life.    {70}        CHAPTER 9.

The condition of affairs in Kirtland during the winter of 1836-7 was  not at all to the liking of Elder Woodruff. To his mind there was no  place in the Church for contentions, misgivings, and opposition. The  work was of God--that was enough. There were the properly appointed  authorities. Upon them the responsibilities of the kingdom had been  placed. He was not therefore concerned about what others thought was a  lack of wisdom in them. He was not avaricious; and financial reverses,  to his mind, could never thwart the purposes of God; and he was not  troubled about how much of this world's goods came to his possession. A  glorious message had been given to the earth, and he wanted every one  to know its value to the human family and to understand the blessings  of salvation to those who yielded obedience.    Wilford Woodruff always felt out of place in the midst of contention.  He shunned it, and never cared for the association of those who were  given to fault-finding, criticisms, and personal griefs. He never saw  the necessity for them. It was never hard for him to agree with his  brethren. He was never unreasonable in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#18)"],[1,"Doniphan said to me that the devastation of Jackson county  forcibly reminded him of this remarkable prediction of the Mormon  prophet.\" (signed) L. M. Lawson.    \"There is a prediction of the Prophet Joseph,\" remarks Elder Wells, in  commenting upon Mr. Lawson's story, \"not before put into print, and  history has recorded its complete fulfillment.\"    That a just retribution overtook the entire state, as well as the  inhabitants of Jackson county, and other western counties, I think must  be conceded by all who are familiar with the events of her history in  the Civil War. That which she did to an inoffensive people was done  to her inhabitants, especially to those living within the districts  formerly occupied by the Latter-day Saints; only the measure meted out  to {LXIX} the Missourians was heaped up, pressed down, and made to run  over.    The Missourians had complained that the Latter-day Saints were eastern  men, whose manners, habits, customs, and even dialect were different  from their own; [65] but the Missourians lived to see great throngs  of those same eastern men flock into an adjoining territory and  infest their border, so that the settlers of western Missouri became  accustomed to, and learned to endure the strange manners, customs and  dialect so different from their own.    The Missourians complained of the rapidity with which the Saints were  gathering into the state to establish their Zion; but the Missourians  lived to see hordes of the detested easterners gather into their region  of country by continuous streams of emigrant trains, sent there by  \"Emigrant Aid Companies\" of New England.    The Missourians falsely charged that the coming of \"Zion's Camp\" into  western Missouri to aid their brethren to repossess their homes in  Jackson county, was an armed invasion of the state; but the Missourians  lived to see formidable hosts of eastern and northern men gather upon  their frontiers and frequently invade the state. \"The character of  much of this emigration may be gathered,\" says one historian, \"from  the fact that the Kansas Emigration Societies, Leagues and Committees  * * * _sent out men only_;\" and that in some of their bands Sharp's  rifles were more numerous than agricultural implements. [66] Of course  the \"Blue Lodges\" of Missouri were organized largely on the same  principle as the \"Emigrant Aid Companies\" of New England, and adopted  practically the same methods, expecting to add Kansas to the list of  slave states. But \"certainly,\" remarks Lucien Carr, \"if a company of  so-called northern emigrants, in which there were two hundred and  twenty-five men and only five women, whose wagons contained no visible  furniture, agricultural implements or mechanical tools, but abounded  in all the requisite articles for camping and campaigning purposes,  were considered as _bona fide_ settlers and permitted to vote, there  could not have been a sufficient reason for ruling out any band of  Missourians who ever crossed the border and declared their intention of  remaining, even though they left the next day.\" [67]    Among the men sent to the borders of Missouri by the \"Emigrant Aid  Companies\" of New England were some of the most desperate adventurers;  and the Missourians who had pretended to be alarmed at the coming of  \"Zion's Camp,\" and feigned to regard it as an armed invasion {LXX}  of the state, saw their state repeatedly invaded--especially Jackson  county--by the bands of Union \"jayhawkers\" organized from among these  desperate eastern and northern men, who ruthlessly laid waste their  homes and farms.    The Missourians had falsely charged the Saints with abolition madness,  with tampering with their slaves, with inviting free negroes into the  state to corrupt their blacks, whose very presence would render their  institution of slave labor insecure; but they lived to see their system  of slave labor abolished by the setting free of some one hundred and  fifteen thousand slaves, valued at $40,000,000, eight thousand of whom  were \"martialed and disciplined for war\" in the Federal armies, and  many of them marched to war against their former masters.    Governor Dunklin and his advisors in the government of Missouri claimed  that there was no warrant of authority under the laws and constitution  of the state for calling out a permanent military force to protect  the Saints in the peaceful possession of their homes until the civil  authority proved itself competent to keep the peace and protect the  citizens in the enjoyment of their guaranteed rights; but the people  in the western part of Missouri saw the time come when they themselves  prayed for the same protection; and Governor Stewart, unlike Governor  Dunklin, approved the appointment of a battalion of volunteers  consisting of three companies of rangers and one of artillery, all  of which were placed under command of Lieutenant-Colonel John L.  Bowen, to do the very thing the Saints had prayed might be done in  their case. [68] But even this provision for their protection did not  avail; for their old jayhawking enemies soon reappeared under new  conditions--which will be stated in the next paragraph--under which  they renewed their incursions of rapine and murder.    The state authorities of Missouri converted the mobs which had  plundered the Saints, burned their homes and laid waste their lands,  into the state militia, which gave the former mob a legal status, under  which guise they plundered the Saints, compelled them to sign away  their property and agree to leave the state. To resist this mob-militia  was to be guilty of treason; but the people of western Missouri lived  to see a like policy pursued towards them. They suffered much in  Jackson and other western counties in the border war, previous to the  opening of the Civil War, from the inroads of abolition \"jayhawkers\" in  the interest of anti-slavery. For a time this was in part suppressed  by the state militia under General Frost and by the permanent force  stationed on the border under Lieutenant-Colonel Bowen. But later,  and when the Civil War broke out, these old \"jayhawking\" leaders \"now  came with United States commissions in their pockets, and at the head  of regularly enlisted troops, in which guise they carried on a {LXXI}  system of robbery and murder that left a good portion of the frontier  south of the Missouri river as perfect a waste as Germany was at the  end of the Thirty Years' War.\" [69]    Such wretches as Generals Lane and Jennison, though Union officers,  and denounced alike by Governor Robinson of Kansas--of course a strong  Union man--and General Halleck, [70] commander-in-chief of the western  armies of the Union, were permitted to disgrace alike the Union cause  and our human nature by their unspeakable atrocities. But they were  retained in office, nevertheless. It was the outrages committed by  these men and their commands, and the Kansas \"Red Legs\" that led to the  equally savage reprisals on the people of Kansas. In revenge for what  western Missouri had suffered, outlawed Missourians sacked Lawrence,  Kansas, a Union city, massacred one hundred and eighty-three of its  inhabitants, and left it in flames. In justification of their act  of savagery, they declared: \"Jennison has laid waste our homes, and  the 'Red Legs' have perpetrated unheard of crimes. Houses have been  plundered and burned, defenseless men shot down, and women outraged.  We are here for revenge--and we have got it.\" [71] How nearly this  language of the Missourians--and there can be no question that it  describes what had been done in Missouri by Lane, Jennison, and their  commands, and the Kansas \"Red Legs\" [72]--follows the complaint justly  made by the Latter-day Saints years before against the Missourians! But  thank God, there is recorded against the Saints no such horrible deeds  of reprisal.    The Missourians falsely charged that the Saints held illicit  communication with the Indian tribes then assembled near the frontiers  of the state, and pretended to an alarm that their state might be  invaded by the savages, prompted thereto by \"Mormon\" fanaticism; but  these same Missourians lived to see cause for real fear of such an  invasion when the Governor of an adjoining state--Arkansas--authorize  Brigadier General Albert Pike to raise two mounted regiments of  Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians to actually invade the state. These  regiments of savages were engaged in the battle of Pea Ridge, on the  southwest {LXXII} borders of Missouri. General Pike, who led them in  that battle, dressed himself in gaudy, savage costume, and wore a  large plume on his head--_a la Niel Gilliam_ at Far West--to please  the Indians. It is also charged that before the battle of Pea Ridge,  he maddened his Indians with liquor \"that they might allow the savage  nature of their race to have unchecked development. In their fury they  respected none of the usages of civilized warfare, but scalped the  helpless wounded, and committed atrocities too horrible to mention.\"  [73] The \"fear\" expressed by the Missourians respecting the alleged  illicit communication of the Saints with the Indians was mere feigning,  but with this example before them, and knowing that there were many  thousands of Indians on their frontiers that might be similarly induced  to take up arms, their former feigned fears became real ones.    The Missourians instead of demanding the execution of the law in  support of the liberties of the Saints, expressed the fear that the  presence of the Saints would give rise to \"Civil War,\" in which none  could be neutrals, since their homes must be the theatre on which  it would be fought, [74] so they drove the Saints away; but the  Missourians lived to see the outbreak of a civil war in their state  that was one of the most appalling men ever witnessed; and Missouri,  when all things are considered, and especially western Missouri,  suffered more than any other"]]]
