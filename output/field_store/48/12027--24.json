He turned instantly and found it was Windsor, who had lost his  foothold about the middle of the narrow pass and had slipped down to the  very verge of the precipice, where he lay on his belly, with his right  arm and leg over the precipice, while with the other leg and arm he was  with difficulty holding on to keep himself from being dashed to pieces  below. His dreadful situation was instantly perceived by Captain Lewis,  who, stifling his alarm, calmly told him that he was in no danger, that  he should take his knife out of his belt with the right hand and dig a  hole in the side of the bluff to receive his foot. With great presence  of mind he did this, and then raised himself on his knees. Captain Lewis  then told him to take off his moccasins and come forward on his hands  and knees, holding the knife in one hand and his rifle in the other. He  immediately crawled in this way till he came to a secure spot.\"    One of Lieutenant Clark's party, on the south fork, at the same time,  ran great danger from a grizzly bear which attacked near camp a man  whose gun, being wet, would not go off. The man took to a tree, so  closely followed by the animal that he struck the hunter's foot as he  was climbing. The bear showed his intention of waiting until the man  should be forced to descend, but fortunately alarmed by the cries and  signal-shots of a searching-party decamped.    While Lewis and Clark concurred in believing the south fork to be the  true Missouri, the rest of the party were unanimous in thinking the  north the right course. Finally caching their heaviest boat and all the  supplies which could well be spared, the entire party followed the south  fork.    Lewis, pushing on confidently with four men, confirmed his opinion by  reaching, on June 13th, the great falls of the Missouri, which by their  sublime majesty and stupendous magnitude fascinated him. The description  of these falls at the time of their first view by civilized man is  worthy of reproduction. The river, three hundred yards wide, was shut  in by precipitous cliffs, and \"for ninety yards from the left cliff the  water falls in one smooth sheet over a precipice of eighty feet. The  rest of the river precipitates itself with a more rapid current, but  received as it falls by the irregular and projecting rocks below, forms  a splendid prospect of white foam two hundred yards in length.... This  spray is dissipated in a thousand shapes.... As it rises from the fall  it beats with fury against a ledge of rocks which extend across the  river.\" On examination Lewis found that \"the river for three miles below  was one continued succession of rapids and cascades, overhung with  perpendicular bluffs from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet  high; in short, it seems to have worn itself a channel through the solid  rock.\" At the main falls, five miles above the first, \"the whole  Missouri is suddenly stopped by one shelving rock, which without a  single niche and with an edge as straight and regular as if formed by  art, stretches itself from one side of the river to the other for at  least a quarter of a mile. Over this the river precipitates itself in an  even, uninterrupted sheet to the perpendicular depth of fifty feet,  whence, dashing against the rocky bottom, it rushes rapidly down,  leaving behind it a spray of the purest foam across the river. The scene  was singularly beautiful, without any of the wild irregular sublimity of  the lower falls.\" In a cottonwood tree, on a small island in the middle  of the rapids, an eagle had fixed its nest, a solitary bird which had  not escaped the observation of the Indians, who had previously  described it to Lewis.    [Illustration]    On leaving the falls Lewis saw a herd of a thousand buffalo, and killed  one for supper. In his eagerness he failed to reload his rifle, when he  beheld a grizzly bear stealing on him and not over twenty paces distant.  \"He felt that there was no safety but in flight. It was in the open,  level plain, ... so that there was no possible mode of concealment....  As soon as he turned the bear ran, open mouthed and at full speed, upon  him. Captain Lewis ran about eighty yards, but finding that the animal  gained on him fast ... he turned short, plunged into the river about  waist deep, and facing about presented the point of his spontoon. The  bear arrived at the water's edge within twenty feet of him, but as soon  as he put himself in this posture of defence, the animal seemed  frightened and retreated with as much precipitation as he had pursued.\"    The means and route for portage presented difficult problems for the  exhausted party, as it was clearly evident that the men could not carry  the boats on their shoulders such great distances. Fortunately a creek  was found at the foot of the falls, where the banks afforded easy access  to the highlands. It was first necessary to cross the Missouri, and here  the party went into camp while preparations were made for the portage.    Lieut. Clark with a few men carefully surveyed the trail to be followed,  others engaged in hunting in order to lay up a store of dried meat, and  the handy men of the party set to work on a carriage for the transport  of the boats. By good fortune they found a large cottonwood-tree, about  twenty-two inches in diameter, large enough to make the carriage-wheels,  \"perhaps the only tree of that size within twenty miles.\" As they had  decided to cache a part of their stores and leave their largest boat  behind, its mast supplied them with two axle-trees.    In the meantime the survey of Clark showed that the series of cataracts  had an aggregate descent of three hundred and sixty-three feet in  seventeen miles, and that a very difficult portage of thirteen miles was  necessary. The country was barely practicable for travel, and was  covered with frequent patches of prickly pear, against the tiny  penetrating needles of which the moccasins of the dragging men afforded  almost no protection. To add to their misfortunes, when about five miles  from their destination the axle-trees, made of the old mast, broke, and  then the tongues of green cottonwood gave way. After diligent search  sweet-willow trees were found with which they managed, by shifts and  expedients familiar to frontiersmen, to patch up the carriage so as to  go on. It broke down so completely about a half mile from the new camp  that it was easier to carry boat and baggage on their shoulders than to  build a new conveyance. The condition of the party is evident from the  narrative:    \"The men are loaded as heavily as their strength will permit; the  crossing is really painful; some are limping with the soreness of their  feet, others are scarcely able to stand for more than a few minutes from  the heat and fatigue; they are all obliged to halt and rest frequently,  and at almost every stopping-place they fall, and many of them are  asleep in an instant.\"    Later it was needful to repair the carriage and to travel over and over  the portage until, after ten days of weary labor, all the equipage was  above the falls.    In the meantime the hunters had accumulated nearly half a ton of dried  meat, buffalo being plenty. The grizzly bear, however, was also present,  active, aggressive, and dangerous as usual. They infested the camp at  night, causing much alarm, and once carried off buffalo-meat from a pole  within thirty yards of the men. A hunter sent out to bring in meat was  boldly attacked by a bear and narrowly escaped death, being pursued to  within forty paces of the camp. Another animal was killed when rushing  up to attack men who had to climb a tree, while making sufficient noise  to attract their rescuer, Drewyer, the interpreter and hunter, who shot  him through the head. He proved to be the largest they had seen, being  eight feet seven and a half inches long, while his fore feet measured  nine inches and hind feet seven inches across, and eleven and  three-quarters long exclusive of the talons. Another hunter was attacked  by a grizzly, fortunately near the river, so that he was able to conceal  himself under a steep bank; otherwise he would probably have lost his  life.    The perils of navigation and the chase were not all, for a cloud-burst  and hail-storm contributed to their danger and suffering. The hail was  so large and driven so furiously by the high wind that it knocked down  several of the men, one three times, bruising another very badly and  wounding some so that they bled freely. The fallen hail lay in drifts,  which in places completely covered the ground, and some of the stones  weighed three ounces and measured seven inches in circumference. Clark,  Chaboneau and his wife took shelter under shelving rocks in a deep  ravine, congratulating themselves on their protected position. Suddenly,  however, the rain fell in a solid mass, and instantly collecting in the  ravine, came rolling down in a dreadful torrent, carrying rocks and  everything before it.    \"But for Lieut. Clark, Chaboneau, his wife and child would have been  lost. So instantly was the rise of the water, that as Lieut. Clark had  reached his gun and began to ascend the bank, the water was up to his  waist, and he could scarce get up faster than it rose, till it reached  the height of fifteen feet, with a furious current which, had they  waited a moment longer, would have swept them into the river just above  the Great Falls, down which they must have inevitably been  precipitated.\"    Though the phases of their daily life brought much that was rough and  hard, yet their privations were not unmixed with pleasures, rude though  they may seem to the city dweller. Long tramps and exciting rides after  game, side marches to commanding hill-tops for grateful views of an  unknown country--barren to the eye, perhaps, but grateful to the soul,  for were they not the first men of their race who ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#18)"],[1,"a very important object with her  to ascertain if possible how far she herself had been compromised by  the revelations of Mrs. Ayliffe. This was the motive of her gentle  questions; for at heart she did not feel the least gentle.    On the other hand John Ayliffe was somewhat angry. All frightened  people are angry when they find others a great deal less frightened  than themselves. Drawing forth his mother's letter then, he thrust it  towards Mrs. Hazleton, almost rudely, saying, \"Read that, madam, and  you'll soon see all the details that you could wish for.\"    Mrs. Hazleton did read it from end to end, postscript and all, and she  saw with infinite satisfaction and delight, that her own name was  never once mentioned in the whole course of that delectable epistle.  As she read that part of the letter, however, in which Mrs. Ayliffe  referred to the very handsome gentlemanly man who had been one of her  unwished for visitors, Mrs. Hazleton said within herself, \"This is  Marlow; Marlow has done this!\" and tenfold bitterness took possession  of her heart. She folded up the letter with neat propriety, however,  and handed it back to John Ayliffe, saying, in her very sweetest  tones, \"Well, I do not think this so very bad as you seem to imagine.  They have found out that your mother is still living, and that is all.  They cannot make much of that.\"    \"Not much of that!\" exclaimed John Ayliffe, now nearly driven to  frenzy, \"what if they convict me of perjury for swearing she was  dead?\"    \"Did you swear she was dead?\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton with an  exceedingly well assumed look of profound astonishment.    \"To be sure I did,\" he answered. \"Why you proposed that she should be  sent away yourself, and Shanks drew out the affidavit.\"    A mingled look of consternation and indignation came into Mrs.  Hazleton's beautiful face; but before she could make any reply he went  on, thinking he had frightened her, which was in itself a satisfaction  and a sort of triumph.    \"Ay, that you did,\" he said, \"and not only that, but you advanced me  all the money to carry on the suit, and I am told that that is  punishable by law. Besides, you knew quite well of the leaf being torn  out of the register, so we are in the same basket I can tell you, Mrs.  Hazleton.\"    \"Sir, you insult me,\" said the lady, rising with an air of imperious  dignity. \"The charity which induced me to advance you different sums  of money, without knowing what they were to be applied to--and I can  prove that some of them were applied to very different purposes than a  suit at law--has been misunderstood, I see. Had I advanced them to  carry on this suit, they would have been paid to your and my lawyer,  not to yourself. Not a word more, if you please! You have mistaken my  character as well as my motives, if you suppose that I will suffer you  to remain here one moment after you have insulted me by the very  thought that I was any sharer in your nefarious transactions.\" She  spoke in a loud shrill tone, knowing that the servants were in the  hall hard by, and then she added, \"Save me the pain, sir, of ordering  some of the men to put you out of the house by quitting it directly.\"    \"Oh, yes, I will go, I will go,\" cried John Ayliffe, now quite  maddened, \"I will go to the devil, and you too, madam,\" and he burst  out of the room, leaving the door open behind him.    \"I can compassionate misfortune,\" cried Mrs. Hazleton, raising her  voice to the very highest pitch for the benefit of others, \"but I will  have nothing to do with roguery and fraud,\" and as she heard his  horse's feet clatter over the terrace, she heartily wished he might  break his neck before he passed the park gates. How far she was  satisfied, and how far she was not, must be shown in another chapter.      CHAPTER XXXV.    John Ayliffe got out of the park gates quite safely, though he rode  down the slope covered with loose stones, as if he had no  consideration for his own neck or his horse's knees. He was in a state  of desperation, however, and feared little at that moment what became  of himself or any thing else. With fierce and angry eagerness he  revolved in his own mind the circumstances of his situation, the  conduct of Mrs. Hazleton, the folly, as he was pleased to term it, of  his mother, the crimes which he had himself committed, and he found no  place of refuge in all the dreary waste of thought. Every thing around  looked menacing and terrible, and the world within was all dark and  stormy.    He pushed his horse some way on the road which he had come, but  suddenly a new thought struck him. He resolved to seek advice and aid  from one whom he had previously determined to avoid. \"I will go to  Shanks,\" he said to himself, \"he at least is in the same basket with  myself. He must work with me, for if my mother has been fool enough to  keep my letters, I have been wise enough to keep his--perhaps  something may be done after all. If not, he shall go along with me,  and we will try if we cannot bring that woman in too. He can prove all  her sayings and doings.\" Thus thinking, he turned his horse's head  towards the lawyer's house, and rode as hard as he could go till he  reached it.    Mr. Shanks was enjoying life over a quiet comfortable bowl of punch in  a little room which looked much more tidy and comfortable, than it had  done twelve or eighteen months before. Mr. Shanks had been well paid.  Mr. Shanks had taken care of himself. No small portion of back rents  and costs had gone into the pockets of Mr. Shanks. Mr. Shanks was all  that he had ever desired to be, an opulent man. Moreover, he was one  of those happily constituted mortals who knew the true use of  wealth--to make it a means of enjoyment. He had no scruples of  conscience--not he. He little cared how the money came, so that it  found its way into his pocket. He was not a man to let his mind be  troubled by any unpleasant remembrances; for he had a maxim that every  man's duty was to do the very best he could for his client, and that  every man's first client was himself.    He heard a horse stop at his door, and having made up his mind to end  the night comfortably, to finish his punch and go to bed, he might  perhaps have been a little annoyed, had he not consoled himself with  the thought that the call must be upon business of importance, and he  had no idea of business of importance unconnected with that of a large  fee.    \"To draw a will, I'll bet any money,\" said Mr. Shanks to himself; \"it  is either old Sir Peter, dying of indigestion, and sent for me when  he's no longer able to speak, or John Ayliffe broken his neck leaping  over a five-barred gate--John Ayliffe, bless us all, Sir John Hastings  I should have said.\"    But the natural voice of John Ayliffe, asking for him in a loud  impatient tone, dispelled these visions of his fancy, and in another  moment the young man was in the room.    \"Ah, Sir John, very glad to see you, very glad to see you,\" said Mr.  Shanks, shaking his visitor's hand, and knocking out the ashes of his  pipe upon the hob; \"just come in pudding time, my dear sir--just in  time for a glass of punch--bring some more lemons and some sugar,  Betty. A glass of punch will do you good. It is rather cold to-night.\"    \"As hot as h--l,\" answered John Ayliffe, sharply; \"but I'll have the  punch notwithstanding,\" and he seated himself while the maid proceeded  to fulfil her master's orders.    Mr. Shanks evidently saw that something had gone wrong with his young  and distinguished client, but anticipating no evil, he was led to  consider whether it was any thing referring to a litter of puppies, a  favorite horse, a fire at the hall, a robbery, or a want of some more  ready money.    At length, however, the fresh lemons and sugar were brought, and the  door closed, before which time John Ayliffe had helped himself to  almost all the punch which he had found remaining in the bowl. It was  not much, but it was strong, and Mr. Shanks applied himself to the  preparation of some more medicine of the same sort. John Ayliffe  suffered him to finish before he said any thing to disturb him, not  from any abstract reverence for the office which Mr. Shanks was  fulfilling, or for love of the beverage he was brewing, but simply  because John Ayliffe began to find that he might as well consider his  course a little. Consideration seldom served him very much, and in the  present instance, after he had labored hard to find out the best way  of breaking the matter, his impetuosity as usual got the better of  him, and he thrust his mother's letter into Mr. Shanks's hand, out of  which as a preliminary he took the ladle and helped himself to another  glass of punch.    The consternation of Mr. Shanks, as he read Mrs. Ayliffe's letter,  stood out in strong opposition to Mrs. Hazleton's sweet calmness. He  was evidently as much terrified as his client; for Mr. Shanks did not  forget that he had written Mrs. Ayliffe two letters since she was  abroad, and as she had kept her son's epistles, Mr. Shanks argued that  it was very likely she had kept his also. Their contents, taken alone,  might amount to very little, but looked at in conjunction with other  circumstances might amount to a great deal.    True, Mr. Shanks had avoided, as far as he could, any discussions in  regard to the more delicate secrets of his profession in the presence  of Mrs. Ayliffe, of whose discretion he was not as firmly convinced as  he could have desired; but it was not always possible to do so,  especially when he had been obliged to seek John Ayliffe in haste at  her house; and now the memories of many long and dangerous  conversations which had occurred in her presence, spread themselves  out before his eyes in a regular row, like items on the leaves of a  ledger.    \"Good God!\" he cried, \"what has she done?\"    \"Every thing she ought not to have done, of course!\" replied John  Ayliffe, replenishing his glass, \"but"]]]
