The man had a curious air about  him, as if he was carrying some secret that was too much for him.    \"Well, nothing exactly new,\" answered Tom. \"At best I am merely  going to try an experiment.\"    \"An experiment, eh?\" resumed Mr. Jenks, \"And might I ask if it has  anything to do with rescuing us from this island?\"    \"I hope it will have,\" answered Tom, gravely.    \"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"Well, now I have a proposition to make  to you. I suppose you are not very wealthy, Mr. Swift?\" He gazed at  Tom, quizzically.    \"I am not poor,\" was the young inventor's proud answer, \"but I would  be glad to make more money--legitimately.\"    \"I thought so. Most every one would. Look here!\"    He approached closer to Tom, and, pulling his hand from his pocket,  held it extended, in the palm were a number of irregularly-shaped  objects--stones or crystals the lad took them to be, yet they did  not look like ordinary stones or crystals.    \"Do you know what those are?\" asked Mr. Jenks.    \"I might guess,\" replied Tom.    \"I'll save you the trouble. They are diamonds! Diamonds of the very  first water, but uncut. Now to the point. I have half a million  dollars worth of them. If you get me safely off this island, I will  agree to make you a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds!\"    \"Make me a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds?\" asked  Tom, struck by the use of the work \"make.\"    \"Yes, 'make,'\" answered Mr. Jenks. \"That is if I can discover the  secret--the secret of Phantom Mountain. Get me away from the island  and I will share my knowledge with you--I need help--help to learn  the secret and help to make the diamonds--see, there are some of the  first ones made, but I have been defrauded of my rights--I need the  aid of a young fellow like you. Will you help? See, I'll give you  some diamonds now. They are genuine, though they are not like  ordinary diamonds. I made them. Will you--\"    Before Tom could answer, there came a warning rumble of the earth,  and a great fissure opened, almost at the feet of Mr. Jenks, who,  with a cry of fear, leaped toward the young inventor.          CHAPTER XIX    SECRET OPERATIONS      \"Help me save this machinery!\" yelled Tom, whose first thought was  for the electrical apparatus. \"Don't let it fall into that chasm!\"    For the crack had widened, until it was almost to the place where  the parts of the wrecked airship had been carried.    \"The machinery? What do I care about the machinery?\" cried Mr.  Jenks. \"I want to save my life!\"    \"And this machinery is our only hope!\" retorted Tom. He began  tugging at the heavy dynamos and gasolene engine, but he might have  saved himself the trouble, for with the same suddenness with which  it opened, the crack closed again. The shock had done it, and, as if  satisfied with that phenomena, the earthquake ceased, and the island  no longer trembled.    \"That was a light one,\" spoke Tom, with an air of relief. He was  becoming used to the shocks now, and, when he saw that his precious  machinery was not damaged he could view the earth tremors calmly.    \"Slight!\" exclaimed Mr. Jenks. \"Well, I don't call it so. But I see  Captain Mentor and Mr. Hosbrook coming. Please don't say anything to  them about the diamonds. I'll see you again,\" and with that, the  queer Mr. Jenks walked away.    \"We came to see if you were hurt,\" called the captain, as he neared  the young inventor.    \"No, I'm all right. How about the others?\"    \"Only frightened,\" replied the yacht owner. \"This is getting awful.  I hoped we were free from the shocks, but they still continue.\"    \"And I guess they will,\" added Tom. \"We certainly are on Earthquake  Island!\"    \"Mr. Parker, the scientist, says this last shock bears out his  theory,\" went on the millionaire. \"He says it will be only a  question of a few days when the whole island will disappear.\"    \"Comforting, to say the least,\" commented Tom.    \"I should say so. But what are you doing, Mr. Swift?\"    \"Trying an experiment,\" answered the young inventor, in some  confusion. He was not yet ready to talk about his plans.    \"We must begin to think seriously of building some sort of a boat or  raft, and getting away from the island,\" went on the millionaire.  \"It will be perilous to go to sea with anything we can construct,  but it is risking our lives to stay here. I don't know what to do.\"    \"Perhaps Captain Mentor has some plan,\" suggested Tom, hoping to  change the subject.    \"No,\" answered the commander, \"I confess I am at a loss to know what  to do. There is nothing with which to do anything, that is the  trouble! But I did think of hoisting another signal, on this end of  the island, where it might be seen if our first one wasn't. I  believe I'll do that,\" and he moved away, to carry out his  intention.    \"Well, I think I'll get back, Tom, and tell the others that you are  all right,\" spoke Mr. Hosbrook. \"I left the camp, after the shock,  because Mrs. Nestor was worried about you.\" The place to which the  airship machinery had been removed was some distance from the camp,  and out of sight of the shacks.    \"Oh, yes. I'm all right,\" said Tom. Then, with a sudden impulse, he  asked:    \"Do you know much about this Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Mr. Hosbrook?\"    \"Not a great deal,\" was the reply. \"In fact, I may say I do not know  him at all. Why do you ask?\"    \"Because I thought he acted rather strangely.\"    \"Just what the rest of us think,\" declared the yacht owner. \"He is  no friend of mine, though he was my guest on the RESOLUTE. It came  about in this way. I had invited a Mr. Frank Jackson to make the  trip with me, and he asked if he could bring with him a Mr. Jenks, a  friend of his. I assented, and Mr. Jackson came aboard with Mr.  Jenks. Just as we were about to sail Mr. Jackson received a message  requiring his presence in Canada, and he could not make the trip.\"    \"But Mr. Jenks seemed so cut-up about being deprived of the yachting  trip, and was so fond of the water, that I invited him to remain on  board, even if his friend did not. So that is how he came to be  among my guests, though he is a comparative stranger to all of us.\"    \"I see,\" spoke Tom.    \"Has he been acting unusually strange?\" asked Mr. Hosbrook  suspiciously.    \"No, only he seemed very anxious to get off the island, but I  suppose we all are. He wanted to know what I planned to do.\"    \"Did you tell him?\"    \"No, for the reason that I don't know whether I can succeed or not,  and I don't want to raise false hopes.\"    \"Then you would prefer not to tell any of us?\"    \"No one--that is except Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Damon. I may need them  to help me.\"    \"I see,\" responded Mr. Hosbrook. \"Well, whatever it is, I wish you  luck. It is certainly a fearful place--this island,\" and busy with  many thoughts, which crowded upon him, the millionaire moved away,  leaving Tom alone.    A little while after this Tom might have been seen in close  conversation with Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick. The former, on hearing  what the young inventor had to say, blessed himself and his various  possessions so often, that he seemed to have gotten out of breath.  Mr. Fenwick exclaimed:    \"Tom, if you can work that it will be one of the greatest things you  have ever done!\"    \"I hope I can work it,\" was all the young inventor replied.    For the next three days Tom, and his two friends, spent most of  their time in the neighborhood of the pile of machinery and  apparatus taken from the wrecked WHIZZER. Mr. Jenks hung around the  spot, but a word or two from Mr. Hosbrook sent him away, and our  three friends were left to their work in peace, for they were  inclined to be secretive about their operations, as Tom did not want  his plans known until he was ready.    The gasolene motor was overhauled, and put in shape to work. Then it  was attached to the dynamo. When this much had been done, Tom and  his friends built a rude shack around the machinery shutting it from  view.    \"Humph! Are you afraid we will steal it?\" asked Mr. Parker, the  scientist, who held to his alarming theory regarding the ultimate  disappearance of the island.    \"No, I simply want to protect it from the weather,\" answered Tom.  \"You will soon know all our plans. I think they will work out.\"    \"You'd better do it before we get another earthquake, and the island  sinks,\" was the dismal response.    But there had been no shocks since the one that nearly engulfed Mr.  Jenks. As for that individual he said little to any one, and  wandered off alone by himself. Tom wondered what kind of diamonds  they were that the odd man had, and the lad even had his doubts as  to the value of the queer stones he had seen. But he was too busy  with his work to waste much time in idle speculation.          CHAPTER XX    THE WIRELESS PLANT      The castaways had been on Earthquake Island a week now, and in that  time had suffered many shocks. Some were mere tremors, and some were  so severe as to throw whole portions of the isle into the sea. They  never could tell when a shock was coming, and often one awakened  them in the night.    But, in spite of this, the refugees were as cheerful as it was  possible to be under the circumstances. Only Mr. Jenks seemed  nervous and ill at ease, and he kept much by himself.    As for Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, the three were busy in their  shack. The others had ceased to ask questions about what they were  doing, and Mr. Nestor and his wife took it for granted that Tom was  building a boat.    Captain Mentor and the mate spent much time gazing off to sea,  hoping for a sight of the sail of some vessel, or the haze that  would indicate the smoke of a steamer. But they saw nothing.    \"I haven't much hope of sighting anything,\" the captain said. \"I  know we are off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#18)"],[1,"augh. \"Come on in, Mrs.  Baggert,\" and the housekeeper entered, her hair all done up in curl  papers.    \"Oh, my goodness me!\" she exclaimed. \"When I heard that cannon go  off I was sure the house was coming down. How is it some one wasn't  killed?\"    \"That wasn't a cannon; it was only my little rifle,\" said Tom, and  then he told again, for the benefit of the housekeeper, the story of  what had happened.    \"We'd better hurry and look around the premises,\" suggested Mr.  Jackson. \"Maybe he is hiding, and will come back, or perhaps he has  some confederates on the watch.\"    \"Not much danger of that,\" declared Tom. \"Happy Harry is far enough  away from here now, and so are his confederates, if he had any,  which I doubt. Still, it will do no harm to take a look around.\"    A search resulted in nothing, however, and the Swift household had  soon settled down again, though no one slept soundly during the  remainder of the night.    In the morning Tom sent word of what had happened to the police of  Shopton. Some officers came out to the house, but, beyond looking  wisely at the window by which the burglar had entered and at some  footprints in the garden, they could do nothing. Tom wanted to go  off on his motor-cycle on a tour of the surrounding neighborhood to  see if he could get any clues, but he did not think it would be wise  in the absence of his father. He thought it would be better to  remain at home, in case any further efforts were made to get  possession of valuable models or papers.    \"There's not much likelihood of that, though,\" said Tom to the old  engineer. \"Those fellows have what they want, and are not going to  bother us again. I would like to get that model back for dad,  though. If they file it and take out a patent, even if he can prove  that it is his, it will mean a long lawsuit and he may be defrauded  of his rights, after all. Possession is nine points of the law, and  part of the tenth, too, I guess.\"    So Tom remained at home and busied himself as well as he could over  some new machines he was constructing. He got a telegram from his  father that afternoon, stating that Mr. Swift had safely arrived in  Albany, and would return the following day.    \"Did you have any luck, dad?\" asked the young inventor, when his  father, tired and worn from the unaccustomed traveling, reached home  in the evening.    \"Not much, Tom,\" was the reply. \"Mr. Crawford has gone back to  Washington, and he is going to do what he can to prevent those men  taking advantage of me.\"    \"Did you get any trace of the thieves? Does Mr. Crawford think he  can?\"    \"No to both questions. His idea is that the men will remain in  hiding for a while, and then, when the matter has quieted down, they  will proceed to get a patent on the motor that I invented.\"    \"But, in the meanwhile, can't you make another model and get a  patent yourself?\"    \"No; there are certain legal difficulties in the way. Besides, those  men have the original papers I need. As for the model, it will take  me nearly a year to build a new one that will work properly, as it  is very complicated. I am afraid, Tom, that all my labor on the  turbine motor is thrown away. Those scoundrels will reap the benefit  of it.\"    \"Oh, I hope not, dad! I'm sure those fellows will be caught. Now  that you are back home again, I'm going out on a hunt on my own  account. I don't put much faith in the police. It was through me,  dad, that you lost your model and the papers, and I'll get them  back!\"    \"No, you must not think it was your fault, Tom,\" said his father.  \"You could not help it, though I appreciate your desire to recover  the missing model.\"    \"And I'll do it, too, dad. I'll start to-morrow, and I'll make a  complete circuit of the country for a hundred miles around. I can  easily do it on my motor-cycle. If I can't get on the trail of the  three men who robbed me, maybe I can find Happy Harry.\"    \"I doubt it, my son. Still, you may try. Now I must write to Mr.  Crawford and tell him about the attempted burglary while I was away.  It may give him a clue to work on. I'm afraid you ran quite a risk,  Tom.\"    \"I didn't think about that, dad. I only wish I had managed to keep  that rascal a prisoner.\"    The next day Tom started off on a hunt. He planned to be gone  overnight, as he intended to go first to Dunkirk, where Mr.  Blackford lived, and begin his search from there.          CHAPTER XX.    ERADICATE SAWS WOOD      The farmer's family, including the son who was a deputy sheriff, was  glad to see Tom. Jed said he had \"been on the job\" ever since the  mysterious robbery of Tom had taken place, but though he had seen  many red automobiles he had no trace of the three men.    From Dunkirk Tom went back over the route he had taken in going from  Pompville to Centreford, and made some inquiries in the neighborhood  of the church shed, where he had taken shelter. The locality was  sparsely settled, however, and no one could give any clues to the  robbers.    The young inventor next made a trip over the lonely, sandy road,  where he had met with the tramp, Happy Harry. But there were even  fewer houses near that stretch than around the church, so he got no  satisfaction there. Tom spent the night at a country inn, and  resumed his search the next morning, but with no results. The men  had apparently completely disappeared, leaving no traces behind  them.    \"I may as well go home,\" thought Tom, as he was riding his motor-cycle  along a pleasant country road. \"Dad may be worried, and perhaps  something has turned up in Shopton that will aid me. If there isn't,  I'm going to start out again in a few days in another direction.\"    There was no news in Shopton, however. Tom found his father  scarcely able to work, so worried was he over the loss of his most  important invention.    Two weeks passed, the young machinist taking trips of several days'  duration to different points near his home, in the hope of  discovering something. But he was unsuccessful, and, in the  meanwhile, no reassuring word was received from the lawyers in  Washington. Mr. Crawford wrote that no move had yet been made by the  thieves to take out patent papers, and while this, in a sense, was  some aid to Mr. Swift, still he could not proceed on his own account  to protect his new motor. All that could be done was to await the  first movement on the part of the scoundrels.    \"I think I'll try a new plan to-morrow, dad,\" announced Tom one  night, when he and his father had talked over again, for perhaps the  twentieth time, the happenings of the last few weeks.    \"What is it, Tom?\" asked the inventor.    \"Well, I think I'll take a week's trip on my machine. I'll visit all  the small towns around here, but, instead of asking in houses for  news of the tramp or his confederates, I'll go to the police and  constables. I'll ask if they have arrested any tramps recently, and,  if they have, I'll ask them to let me see the 'hobo' prisoners.\"    \"What good will that do?\"    \"I'll tell you. I have an idea that though the burglar who got in  here may not be a regular tramp, yet he disguises himself like one  at times, and may be known to other tramps. If I can get on the  trail of Happy Harry, as he calls himself, I may locate the other  men. Tramps would be very likely to remember such a peculiar chap as  Happy Harry, and they will tell me where they had last seen him.  Then I will have a starting point.\"    \"Well, that may be a good plan,\" assented Mr. Swift. \"At any rate it  will do no harm to try. A tramp locked up in a country police  station will very likely be willing to talk. Go ahead with that  scheme, Tom, but don't get into any danger. How long will you be  away?\"    \"I don't know. A week, perhaps; maybe longer. I'll take plenty of  money with me, and stop at country hotels overnight.\"    Tom lost no time in putting his plan into execution. He packed some  clothes in a grip, which he attached to the rear of his motor-cycle,  and then having said good-by to his father, started off. The first  three days he met with no success. He located several tramps in  country lock-ups, where they had been sent for begging or loitering,  but none of them knew Happy Harry or had ever heard of a tramp  answering his description.    \"He ain't one of us, youse can make up your mind to dat,\" said one  \"hobo\" whom Tom interviewed. \"No real knight of de highway goes  around in a disguise. We leaves dat for de story-book detectives.  I'm de real article, I am, an' I don't know Happy Harry. But, fer  dat matter, any of us is happy enough in de summer time, if we don't  strike a burgh like dis, where dey jugs you fer panhandlin'.\"    In general, Tom found the tramp willing enough to answer his  questions, though some were sullen, and returned only surly growls  to his inquiries.    \"I guess I'll have to give it up and go back home,\" he decided one  night. But there was a small town, not many miles from Shopton,  which he had not yet visited, and he resolved to try there before  returning. Accordingly, the next morning found him inquiring of the  police authorities in Meadton. But no tramps had been arrested in  the last month, and no one had seen anything of a tramp like Happy  Harry or three mysterious men in an automobile.    Tom was beginning to despair. Riding along a silent road, that  passed through a strip of woods, he was trying to think of some new  line of procedure, when the silence of the highway, that, hitherto,  had resounded only with the muffled explosions of his machine, was  broken by several exclamations.    \"Now, Boomerang, yo' might jest as well start now as later,\" Tom heard  a voice saying--a voice he recognized well. \"Yo' hab got t' do dis  yeah wuk, an' dere ain't no gittin' out ob it. Dis yeah wood am got to  be sawed, an' yo' hab got to saw it. But it am jest laik yo' to go  back on yo' ole friend Eradicate in dis yeah fashion. I neber could  tell what yo' were gwine t'"]]]
