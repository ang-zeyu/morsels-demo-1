NATURE contains Original Articles on all subjects coming within the  domain of Science, contributed by the most eminent Scientists, belonging  to all parts of the world.    Reviews, setting forth the nature and value of recent Scientific works,  are written for NATURE by men who are acknowledged masters in their  particular departments.    The Correspondence columns of NATURE, while forming a medium of  Scientific discussion and of intercommunication among the most  distinguished men of Science, have become the recognized organ for  announcing new discoveries and new illustrations of Scientific  principles among observers of Nature all the world over--from Japan to  San Francisco, from New Zealand to Iceland.    The Serial columns of NATURE contain the gist of the most important  Papers that appear in the numerous Scientific Journals which are now  published at home and abroad, in various languages; while longer  Abstracts are given of the more valuable Papers which appear in foreign  Journals.    The Principal Scientific Societies and Academies of the world, British  and foreign, have their transactions regularly recorded in NATURE, the  Editor being in correspondence, for this purpose, with representatives  of Societies in all parts of the world.    Notes from the most trustworthy sources appear each week recording the  latest gossip of the Scientific world at home and abroad.    As questions of Science compass all limits of nationality, and are of  universal interest, a periodical devoted to them may fitly appeal to the  intelligent classes in all countries where its language is read. The  proprietors of NATURE aim so to conduct it that it shall have a common  claim upon all English-speaking peoples. Its articles are brief and  condensed, and are thus suited to the circumstances of an active and  busy people who have little time to read extended and elaborate  treatises.

They congregate in large numbers where the  wild rice is ripening and make short excursions to the farmers'  fields, where they destroy some grain, it is true, but so little as  compared with the quantity of injurious insects and weed seed, that  the debt is largely in the red-wings' favour.    {143}    RUSTY BLACKBIRD    _Called also: Thrush Blackbird_    This cousin of the red-wing, whom it resembles in size, flight and  notes, is a common migrant in the United States. Nesting is done  farther north. In spring, the rusty blackbirds come from the South in  pairs, already mated, whereas the red-wings and grackles travel then  in flocks. At that time the males are a uniform glossy, bluish-black,  and their mates a slate gray, darker above than below; but after the  summer moult, when they gather in small companies, both are decidedly  rusty. You might mistake them for grackles in the spring, but never  for male red-wings then with their bright epaulettes. Notice the rusty  blackbird's pale yellow eye.      MEADOWLARK    _Called also: Old-field Lark; Meadow Starling_    Every farmer's boy knows his father's friend, the meadowlark, the  brownish, mottled bird, larger than a robin, with a lovely yellow  breast and black crescent on it, that keeps well hidden in the grass  of the meadows or grain fields. Of course he knows, too, that it is  not really a lark, but a starling. When the shy bird takes wing, note  the white feathers on the {144} sides of its tail to be sure it is not  the big, brownish flicker, who wears a patch of white feathers on its  lower back, conspicuous as it flies. The meadowlark has the impolite  habit of turning its back upon one as if it thought its yellow breast  too beautiful for human eyes to gaze at. It flaps and sails through  the air much like bob-white. But flying is not its specialty. It is,  however, a strong-legged, active walker, and rarely rises from the  ground unless an intruder gets very near, when away it flies, with a  nasal, sputtered alarm note, to alight upon a fence rail or other low  perch.    The tender, sweet, plaintive, flute-like whistle,  _Spring-o'-the-year_, is a deliberate song usually given from some  favourite platform--a stump, a rock, a fence or a mound, to which the  bird goes for his musical performance only. He sings on and on  delightfully, not always the same song, for he has several in his  repertoire, and charms all listeners, although he cares to please none  but his mate, that looks just like him.    She keeps well concealed among the grasses where her grassy nest is  almost impossible to find, especially if it be partly arched over at  the top. No farmer who realises what an enormous number of  grasshoppers, not to mention other destructive insects, meadowlarks  destroy, is foolish enough to let his {145} mowing-machine pass over  their nests if he can but locate them. By the time the hay is ready  for cutting in June, the active meadowlark babies are usually running  about through grassy run-ways, but eggs of the second brood too  frequently, alas! meet a tragic end.      ORCHARD ORIOLE    Fortunately many other birds besides this oriole prefer to live in  orchards; otherwise think how many worm-eaten apples there would be!  He usually has the kingbird for company, and, strange to say, keeps on  friendly terms with that rather exclusive fellow; also the robin, the  bluebird, the cedar waxwing and several other feathered neighbours who  show a preference for fruit trees when it is time to nest. You may  know the orchard oriole's cradle by its excellent weaving. It is not a  deep, swinging pouch, like the Baltimore oriole's, but a well-rounded  cup, more like a vireo's, formed of grasses of nearly even length and  width, cut green and woven with far more skill and precision than a  basket made by a boy or a girl is apt to be. Look for it near the end  of a limb, ten to twenty feet up. It is by no means easily seen when  the green, grassy cup matches the colour of the leaves.    The mother oriole is so harmoniously dressed {146} in grayish olive  green, more yellowish underneath, that you may scarcely notice her as  she glides among the trees; but her mate is more conspicuous, however  quietly dressed in black and reddish chestnut--even somberly dressed  as compared with his flashy orange and black cousin, the Baltimore  oriole. Nevertheless, it takes him two, or possibly three years to  attain his fine clothes. By that time his song is rich, sweet and  strong.    Do orioles generally take special delight in the music of a piano? An  orchard oriole who used to come close to our house to feed on the  basket worms dangling from a tamarix bush, returned long after the  last worm had been eaten whenever someone touched the keys. And I have  known more than one Baltimore oriole to fly about the house, joyously  singing, as if attracted and excited by the music in-doors.      BALTIMORE ORIOLE    _Called also: Firebird; Golden Robin; Hang-nest;  Golden Oriole_    A flash of flame among the tender young spring foliage; a rich, high,  whistled song from the blossoming cherry trees, and every child knows  that the sociable Baltimore oriole has just returned from Central  America.      [Illustration]    The gorgeous Baltimore oriole      [Illustration]    How do you suppose these young Baltimore orioles ever packed  themselves into so small a nest?    {147}    Brilliant orange and black feathers like his could no more be  concealed than the fiery little redstart's; and as if they alone were  not enough to advertise his welcome presence in the neighbourhood, he  keeps up a rich, ringing, insistent whistle that you can quickly learn  to imitate. You have often started all the roosters in your  neighbourhood to crowing, no doubt; even so you can \"whistle up\" the  mystified orioles, who are always disposed to live near our homes.  Although the Baltimore oriole has a Southern name, he is really more  common at the North, whereas the orchard oriole is more at home south  of New England.    Lady Baltimore, who wears a yellowish-olive dress with dusky wings and  tail, has the reputation of being one of the finest nest builders in  the world. To the end of a branch of some tall shade tree, preferably  an elm or willow, although almost any large tree on a lawn or roadside  may suit her, she carries grasses, plant fibre, string, or bits of  cloth. These she weaves and felts into a perfect bag six or seven  inches deep and lines it with finer grasses, hair and wool--a safe,  cozy, swinging cradle for her babies.    But, as you may imagine, those babies have a rather hard time when  they try to climb out of it into the world. Many a one tumbles to the  ground, unable to hold on to the tip of a {148} swaying twig, and not  being strong enough to fly. Then what a tremendous fuss the parents  make! They cannot carry the youngster up into the tree; they are in  deadly fear of cats; they are too worried and excited to leave him  alone; but the plucky little fellow usually hops toward the tree and  with the help of his sharp claws on the rough bark, flutters his way  up to the first limb. People who have brought up broods of orphan  orioles say that they are unusually lively, interesting pets. The  little girl orioles will attempt, instinctively, to weave worsted,  string, grass, or whatever is given them to play with, for of course  they never took a lesson in weaving from their expert mother.      THE PURPLE AND THE BRONZED GRACKLES    _Called also: Crow Blackbirds_    You probably know either one of our two crow blackbirds, similar in  size and habits, one with purplish, iridescent plumage, the commonest  grackle east of the Alleghenies and south of Massachusetts, and the  bronzed grackle, with brassy tints in his black plumage, who overruns  the Western country and from Massachusetts northward. {149} Both have  uncanny, yellow eyes that make you suspect they may be witches in  disguise. Their mates are a trifle smaller and duller.    When the trees are still leafless in earliest spring and the ground is  brown and cold, flocks of blackbirds dot the bare trees or take  shelter from March winds among their favourite evergreens, or walk  solemnly about on the earth like small crows, feeding on fat white  grubs and beetles in a business-like way. They are singularly joyless  birds. A croaking, wheezy whistle, like the sound of a cart wheel that  needs axle-grease, expresses whatever pleasure they may have in life.    Always sociable, living in flocks the entire year through, it is in  autumn only that they band together in enormous numbers, and in the  West especially, do serious havoc in the cornfields. However, they do  incalculable good as insect destroyers, so the farmers must forgive  the \"maize thieves.\"    ......    Was ever a family so ill-assorted as the blackbird and oriole clan?  What traits are common to every member of it? Not one, that I know.  Some of the family, as you have seen, are gorgeously clad, like the  Baltimore oriole; some quite plainly, like the cowbird; and although  black seems to be a prevalent colour in the {150} plumage, the  meadowlark, for example, is a brown bird with only a black crescent on  its breast. Most of the males are dressed quite differently from their  mates, although the female grackles are merely duller. Some of these  birds sing exquisitely; others wheeze or croak a few unmusical notes.  Some live in huge flocks; some live in couples. Some, like the  bobolinks, travel to the tropics and beyond every winter; others, like  the meadowlark, can endure the intense cold of the North. Part of the  family feed upon the ground, but the oriole branch live in the trees.  Devotion to mates and children characterise most of the family, but we  cannot overlook the cowbird that neither mates nor takes the slightest  care of its offspring. The cowbird builds no nest, while its cousin,  the Baltimore oriole,"]]]
