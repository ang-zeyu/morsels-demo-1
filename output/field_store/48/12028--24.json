He possessed an advantage over the critics  of old Europe--that of being able to treat literary questions without  mixing up with them recollections of national rivalries.\" He concludes  his article by saying, \"This work is an inestimable repertory; it must  be eminently useful in a library. It comprises very good biographical  notices of the Spanish authors, and numerous abstracts which obviate  the necessity of reference to the original authorities. The  translations, which are copious, are executed with surpassing taste,  to afford an idea of the style of the Spanish poets. Thanks to the  flexibility of the English language, and the ability or command of the  author in using it, the translations are of signal fidelity and  elegance. The rhythm, the flow, the idiomatic grace and _curiosa  felicitas_, are rendered in the most exact and the happiest manner.\"           *       *       *       *       *    By a letter in the London _Times_, signed ERNESTO SUSANNI, it appears  that M. LIBRI may be a very much wronged person. The readers of the  _International_ will remember his trial, a few months ago, and his  condemnation to ten years' imprisonment (in default of judgment), and  deprivation of the various high offices he held, for having, as was  alleged, stolen from the Mazarine Library, besides others, the  following volumes: _Petrarca, gli Triomphi_, 1475: Bologna, in folio;  _Pamphyli poetae lepidissimi Epigrammatum libri quatuor; Faccio degli  Uberti, opera chiamata Ditta Munde Venezia_, 1501, quarto; _Phalaris  Epistole, traducte del Latino da Bartol: Fontio_, 1471, quarto;  _Dante, Convivio_: Florence, 1490, quarto; &c. M. Susanni alleges that  the learned bibliographer, M. Silvestre, has discovered in the  Mazarine Library that, contrary to the very circumstantial affirmation  of the deed of accusation, the above-mentioned books _are still in  their places on the shelves of that library_, from which they have  never been absent, and where any one may go and see them, and verify  the fact for himself. The persons employed to draw up the charges  against M. Libri never appeared to understand that two different  editions of a work were totally different things, and they have  accused M. Libri of having stolen a work from a public library, simply  because M. Libri possessed an edition of that work, though different  from the one the library had lost, or, better still, which it had  never lost at all. Considering all the circumstances, and the  attention which was attracted to the case throughout the learned  world, this is very curious: it will form one of the most remarkable  of the _causes celebres_.           *       *       *       *       *    The new Paris review, _La Politique Nouvelle_, starts bravely its  career as a rival of _La Revue des Deux Mondes_. The leading article,  \"La Constitution, c'est l'order,\" is by M. Marie, who was one of the  chiefs of the Provisional Government, and Henri Martin, Gustave  Cazavan, and Paul Rochery, are among the contributors; but the best  attraction of the work to those who do not care for its politics, is  the beginning of a charming novel by Madame Charles Reybaud, the  authoress of Tales of the Old Convents of Paris.           *       *       *       *       *    Lamartine's reputation declines with every new attempt of his at  money-making. There was never a man capable of doing well a half of  what he advertises. He is writing a romance on the destruction of the  Janizaries, for the _Pays_, another romance for the _Siecle_, and  occasionally gives _feuilletons_ to other journals; he is re-editing a  complete edition of his own works, writing a history of the  Restoration, and a history of Turkey, and has lately begun to edit a  daily paper. He also continues the monthly pamphlet, of between thirty  and forty pages, the _Conseiller du Peuple_, on political matters, and  produces once a month a periodical, _Les Foyers du Peuple_, in which  he gives an account of his travels, with tales and verses.           *       *       *       *       *    The Paris correspondent of the London _Literary Gazette_ states, that  an Assyrian, named FURIS SCHYCYAC, is at present attracting some  attention in the literary circles. He had just arrived from London,  where, it appears, he translated the Bible into Arabic, for one of the  religious associations. He has accompanied his _debut_ in  Parisian society with a _mudh_, or poem, to Paris, in which he almost  out-Orientals the Orientals in his exaggerated compliments and  gorgeous imagery. Paris, he declares, amongst other things, is the  \"terrestrial paradise,\" the \"_sejour_ of houris,\" and \"Eden;\" whilst  the people are, _par excellence_, \"the strong, the generous, the  brave, the sincere-hearted, with no faults to diminish their virtues.\"  This master-stroke has opened the Parisian circles to the cunning  Assyrian.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Leroux has published in Paris a volume of Reminiscences of Travel  and Residence in the United States, with observations on the  Administration of Justice in this country.           *       *       *       *       *    The last _Edinburgh Review_ has an article on COUSIN, in which a  general survey is taken of his life and of his works, of which he has  just completed the publication of a new edition. The _London Leader_  says that the critic ingeniously represents all Cousin's plagiarisms  as the consequences of the progressive and _assimilative_ intellect of  the eclectic chief; that it would be easy with the same facts to tell  a very different story; and correct the reviewer's \"mistake,\" where he  talks of Cousin as the translator of Plato. Cousin's name is on the  title-page; but not one dialogue, the _Leader_ avers, did he  translate; it even doubts his ability to translate one. What he did  was to take old translations by De Grow and others, here and there  polishing the style; and the dialogues that were untranslated he gave  to certain clever young men in want of employment and glad of his  patronage. He touched up their style and wrote the Preface to each  Dialogue, for which the work bears his name! _This_ explains the  puzzling fact that the translator of Plato should so completely  misunderstand the purpose of the dialogue he is prefacing. Gigantic  indeed would be the labors of Cousin--if he performed them himself.           *       *       *       *       *    Walter Savage Landor is now seventy-six years of age. He writes no  more great works, but he is hardly less industrious than a  penny-a-liner in writing upon all sorts of subjects for the journals.  We find his communications almost every week in _The Examiner_, _The  News_, _The Leader_, _Leigh Hunt's Journal_, and other periodicals.  Sometimes he rises to his earlier eloquence, and we hear the voice  that was loudest and sweetest in the \"Imaginary Conversations;\" but  for the most part his newspaper pieces are feeble and splenetic,  unworthy of him. One of his latest composures has relation to Lord  Lyndhurst, by whose speech against the revolutionary aliens in England  had been excited the ire of the old poet. \"In your paper of this day,  April 12,\" he writes to the editor of _The Examiner_, \"I find repeated  an expression of Lord Lyndhurst's, which I am certain will be  offensive to many of your readers. General Klapka, a man illustrious  for his military knowledge, and for his application of it to the  defence of his country and her laws, is contemptuously called _one_  Klapka. The most obscure and the most despicable (and those only) are  thus designated. Surely to have been called by the acclamations of a  whole people to defend the most important of its fortresses is quite  as exalted a distinction as to be appointed a Lord Chamberlain or a  Lord Chancellor by the favor of one minister, and liable to be  dismissed the next morning by another. With all proper respect for the  cleverness of Lord Lyndhurst, I must entreat your assistance in  discovering one sentence he ever wrote, or spoke, denoting the man of  lofty genius or capacious mind. Memorable things he certainly has  said--such as calling by the name of aliens a third part of our  fellow-subjects in these islands, and by the prefix of a _certain_ to  the name of Klapka. It is strange that sound law should not always be  sound sense; strange that the great seal of equity should make so  faint and indistinct an impression. Klapka will be commemorated and  renowned in history as one beloved by the people, venerated by the  nobility; whose voice was listened to attentively by the magistrate,  enthusiastically by the soldier. The fame of Lord Lyndhurst is  ephemeral, confined to the Court of Chancery and the House of Peers;  dozens have shared it in each, and have gone to dinner and oblivion.  Those, and those alone, are great men whose works or words are  destined to be the heirlooms of many generations. God places them  where time passes them without erasing their footsteps. Kings can  never make them. They, if minded so, could more easily make kings.  England hath installed one Chancellor who might have been consummately  great, had there only been in his composition the two simple elements  of generosity and honesty. Bacon did not hate freedom, or the friends  of freedom; and, although he cautiously kept clear of so dangerous a  vicinity, he never came voluntarily forth, invoking the vindictive  spirit of a dead law to eliminate them in the hour of adversity from  their sanctuary.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Rev. Moses Margoliouth, who was once a Jew, and who last year  published a narrative of a journey to Palestine, under the title of \"A  Visit to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#18)"],[1," it has also been the source of much good;  that if it is the child of error, it has yet been the mother of  freedom and truth.          IV. Magic and Religion    THE examples collected in the last chapter may suffice to illustrate  the general principles of sympathetic magic in its two branches, to  which we have given the names of Homoeopathic and Contagious  respectively. In some cases of magic which have come before us we  have seen that the operation of spirits is assumed, and that an  attempt is made to win their favour by prayer and sacrifice. But  these cases are on the whole exceptional; they exhibit magic tinged  and alloyed with religion. Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its  pure unadulterated form, it assumes that in nature one event follows  another necessarily and invariably without the intervention of any  spiritual or personal agency. Thus its fundamental conception is  identical with that of modern science; underlying the whole system  is a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order and uniformity  of nature. The magician does not doubt that the same causes will  always produce the same effects, that the performance of the proper  ceremony, accompanied by the appropriate spell, will inevitably be  attended by the desired result, unless, indeed, his incantations  should chance to be thwarted and foiled by the more potent charms of  another sorcerer. He supplicates no higher power: he sues the favour  of no fickle and wayward being: he abases himself before no awful  deity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, is by no means  arbitrary and unlimited. He can wield it only so long as he strictly  conforms to the rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws  of nature as conceived by him. To neglect these rules, to break  these laws in the smallest particular, is to incur failure, and may  even expose the unskilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril.  If he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is a constitutional  sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact  conformity with ancient usage. Thus the analogy between the magical  and the scientific conceptions of the world is close. In both of  them the succession of events is assumed to be perfectly regular and  certain, being determined by immutable laws, the operation of which  can be foreseen and calculated precisely; the elements of caprice,  of chance, and of accident are banished from the course of nature.  Both of them open up a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to  him who knows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs  that set in motion the vast and intricate mechanism of the world.  Hence the strong attraction which magic and science alike have  exercised on the human mind; hence the powerful stimulus that both  have given to the pursuit of knowledge. They lure the weary  enquirer, the footsore seeker, on through the wilderness of  disappointment in the present by their endless promises of the  future: they take him up to the top of an exceeding high mountain  and show him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet,  a vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be, but radiant with  unearthly splendour, bathed in the light of dreams.    The fatal flaw of magic lies not in its general assumption of a  sequence of events determined by law, but in its total misconception  of the nature of the particular laws which govern that sequence. If  we analyse the various cases of sympathetic magic which have been  passed in review in the preceding pages, and which may be taken as  fair samples of the bulk, we shall find, as I have already  indicated, that they are all mistaken applications of one or other  of two great fundamental laws of thought, namely, the association of  ideas by similarity and the association of ideas by contiguity in  space or time. A mistaken association of similar ideas produces  homoeopathic or imitative magic: a mistaken association of  contiguous ideas produces contagious magic. The principles of  association are excellent in themselves, and indeed absolutely  essential to the working of the human mind. Legitimately applied  they yield science; illegitimately applied they yield magic, the  bastard sister of science. It is therefore a truism, almost a  tautology, to say that all magic is necessarily false and barren;  for were it ever to become true and fruitful, it would no longer be  magic but science. From the earliest times man has been engaged in a  search for general rules whereby to turn the order of natural  phenomena to his own advantage, and in the long search he has  scraped together a great hoard of such maxims, some of them golden  and some of them mere dross. The true or golden rules constitute the  body of applied science which we call the arts; the false are magic.    If magic is thus next of kin to science, we have still to enquire  how it stands related to religion. But the view we take of that  relation will necessarily be coloured by the idea which we have  formed of the nature of religion itself; hence a writer may  reasonably be expected to define his conception of religion before  he proceeds to investigate its relation to magic. There is probably  no subject in the world about which opinions differ so much as the  nature of religion, and to frame a definition of it which would  satisfy every one must obviously be impossible. All that a writer  can do is, first, to say clearly what he means by religion, and  afterwards to employ the word consistently in that sense throughout  his work. By religion, then, I understand a propitiation or  conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct  and control the course of nature and of human life. Thus defined,  religion consists of two elements, a theoretical and a practical,  namely, a belief in powers higher than man and an attempt to  propitiate or please them. Of the two, belief clearly comes first,  since we must believe in the existence of a divine being before we  can attempt to please him. But unless the belief leads to a  corresponding practice, it is not a religion but merely a theology;  in the language of St. James, \"faith, if it hath not works, is dead,  being alone.\" In other words, no man is religious who does not  govern his conduct in some measure by the fear or love of God. On  the other hand, mere practice, divested of all religious belief, is  also not religion. Two men may behave in exactly the same way, and  yet one of them may be religious and the other not. If the one acts  from the love or fear of God, he is religious; if the other acts  from the love or fear of man, he is moral or immoral according as  his behaviour comports or conflicts with the general good. Hence  belief and practice or, in theological language, faith and works are  equally essential to religion, which cannot exist without both of  them. But it is not necessary that religious practice should always  take the form of a ritual; that is, it need not consist in the  offering of sacrifice, the recitation of prayers, and other outward  ceremonies. Its aim is to please the deity, and if the deity is one  who delights in charity and mercy and purity more than in oblations  of blood, the chanting of hymns, and the fumes of incense, his  worshippers will best please him, not by prostrating themselves  before him, by intoning his praises, and by filling his temples with  costly gifts, but by being pure and merciful and charitable towards  men, for in so doing they will imitate, so far as human infirmity  allows, the perfections of the divine nature. It was this ethical  side of religion which the Hebrew prophets, inspired with a noble  ideal of God's goodness and holiness, were never weary of  inculcating. Thus Micah says: \"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is  good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and  to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" And at a later time  much of the force by which Christianity conquered the world was  drawn from the same high conception of God's moral nature and the  duty laid on men of conforming themselves to it. \"Pure religion and  undefiled,\" says St. James, \"before God and the Father is this, To  visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep  himself unspotted from the world.\"    But if religion involves, first, a belief in superhuman beings who  rule the world, and, second, an attempt to win their favour, it  clearly assumes that the course of nature is to some extent elastic  or variable, and that we can persuade or induce the mighty beings  who control it to deflect, for our benefit, the current of events  from the channel in which they would otherwise flow. Now this  implied elasticity or variability of nature is directly opposed to  the principles of magic as well as of science, both of which assume  that the processes of nature are rigid and invariable in their  operation, and that they can as little be turned from their course  by persuasion and entreaty as by threats and intimidation. The  distinction between the two conflicting views of the universe turns  on their answer to the crucial question, Are the forces which govern  the world conscious and personal, or unconscious and impersonal?  Religion, as a conciliation of the superhuman powers, assumes the  former member of the alternative. For all conciliation implies that  the being conciliated is a conscious or personal agent, that his  conduct is in some measure uncertain, and that he can be prevailed  upon to vary it in the desired direction by a judicious appeal to  his interests, his appetites, or his emotions. Conciliation is never  employed towards things which are regarded as inanimate, nor towards  persons whose behaviour in the particular circumstances is known to  be determined with absolute certainty. Thus in so far as religion  assumes the world to be directed by conscious agents who may be  turned from their"]]]
