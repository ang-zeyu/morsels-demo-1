Every art, from architecture to poetry, is brought into  requisition to work its effect on men's souls and to reduce them  to a state of stupefaction, and this effect is constantly  produced.  This use of hypnotizing influence on men to bring them  to a state of stupefaction is especially apparent in the  proceedings of the Salvation Army, who employ new practices to  which we are unaccustomed: trumpets, drums, songs, flags,  costumes, marching, dancing, tears, and dramatic performances.    But this only displeases us because these are new practices.  Were  not the old practices in churches essentially the same, with their  special lighting, gold, splendor, candles, choirs, organ, bells,  vestments, intoning, etc.?    But however powerful this hypnotic influence may be, it is not the  chief nor the most pernicious activity of the  Church.  The chief and most pernicious work of the Church is that  which is directed to the deception of children--these very  children of whom Christ said: \"Woe to him that offendeth one of  these little ones.\"  From the very first awakening of the  consciousness of the child they begin to deceive him, to instill  into him with the utmost solemnity what they do not themselves  believe in, and they continue to instill it into him till the  deception has by habit grown into the child's nature.  They  studiously deceive the child on the most important subject in  life, and when the deception has so grown into his life that it  would be difficult to uproot it, then they reveal to him the whole  world of science and reality, which cannot by any means be  reconciled with the beliefs that have been instilled into him,  leaving it to him to find his way as best he can out of these  contradictions.    If one set oneself the task of trying to confuse a man so that he  could not think clearly nor free himself from the perplexity of  two opposing theories of life which had been instilled into him  from childhood, one could not invent any means more effectual than  the treatment of every young man educated in our so-called  Christian society.    It is terrible to think what the churches do to men. But  if one imagines oneself in the position of the men who constitute  the Church, we see they could not act differently.  The churches  are placed in a dilemma: the Sermon on the Mount or the Nicene  Creed--the one excludes the other.  If a man sincerely believes in  the Sermon on the Mount, the Nicene Creed must inevitably lose all  meaning and significance for him, and the Church and its  representatives together with it.  If a man believes in the Nicene  Creed, that is, in the Church, that is, in those who call  themselves its representatives, the Sermon on the Mount becomes  superfluous for him.  And therefore the churches cannot but make  every possible effort to obscure the meaning of the Sermon on the  Mount, and to attract men to themselves.  It is only due to the  intense zeal of the churches in this direction that the influence  of the churches has lasted hitherto.    Let the Church stop its work of hypnotizing the masses, and  deceiving children even for the briefest interval of time, and men  would begin to understand Christ's teaching.  But this  understanding will be the end of the churches and all their  influence.  And therefore the churches will not for an instant  relax their zeal in the business of hypnotizing grown-up people  and deceiving children.  This, then, is the work of the churches:  to instill a false interpretation of Christ's teaching into men,  and to prevent a true interpretation of it for the majority of  so-called believers.          CHAPTER IV.    CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MEN OF SCIENCE.    Attitude of Men of Science to Religions in General--What Religion is,  and What is its Significance for the Life of Humanity--Three Conceptions  of Life--Christian Religion the Expression of the Divine Conception of  Life--Misinterpretation of Christianity by Men of Science, who Study it  in its External Manifestations Due to their Criticising it from  Standpoint of Social Conception of Life--Opinion, Resulting from this  Misinterpretation, that Christ's Moral Teaching is Exaggerated and  Cannot be put into Practice--Expression of Divine Conception of Life in  the Gospel--False Ideas of Men of Science on Christianity Proceed from  their Conviction that they have an Infallible Method of Criticism--From  which come Two Misconceptions in Regard to Christian Doctrine--First  Misconception, that the Teaching Cannot be put into Practice, Due to the  Christian Religion Directing Life in a Way Different from that of the  Social Theory of Life--Christianity holds up Ideal, does not lay down  Rules--To the Animal Force of Man Christ Adds the Consciousness of a  Divine Force--Christianity Seems to Destroy Possibility of Life only  when the Ideal held up is Mistaken for Rule--Ideal Must Not be  Lowered--Life, According to Christ's Teaching, is Movement--The Ideal  and the Precepts--Second Misconception Shown in Replacing Love and  Service of God by Love and Service of Humanity--Men of Science Imagine  their Doctrine of Service of Humanity and Christianity are  Identical--Doctrine of Service of Humanity Based on Social Conception of  Life--Love for Humanity, Logically Deduced from Love of Self, has No  Meaning because Humanity is a Fiction--Christian Love Deduced from Love  of God, Finds its Object in the whole World, not in Humanity  Alone--Christianity Teaches Man to Live in Accordance with his Divine  Nature--It Shows that the Essence of the Soul of Man is Love, and that  his Happiness Ensues from Love of God, whom he Recognizes as Love within  himself.      Now I will speak of the other view of Christianity which hinders  the true understanding of it--the scientific view.    Churchmen substitute for Christianity the version they have framed  of it for themselves, and this view of Christianity they regard as  the one infallibly true one.    Men of science regard as Christianity only the tenets held by the  different churches in the past and present; and finding that these  tenets have lost all the significance of Christianity, they accept  it as a religion which has outlived its age.    To see clearly how impossible it is to understand the Christian  teaching from such a point of view, one must form for oneself an  idea of the place actually held by religions in general, by the  Christian religion in particular, in the life of mankind, and of  the significance attributed to them by science.    Just as the individual man cannot live without having some theory  of the meaning of his life, and is always, though often  unconsciously, framing his conduct in accordance with the meaning  he attributes to his life, so too associations of men living in  similar conditions--nations--cannot but have theories of the  meaning of their associated life and conduct ensuing from those  theories.  And as the individual man, when he attains a fresh  stage of growth, inevitably changes his philosophy of life, and  the grown-up man sees a different meaning in it from the child, so  too associations of men--nations--are bound to change their  philosophy of life and the conduct ensuing from their philosophy,  to correspond with their development.    The difference, as regards this, between the individual man and  humanity as a whole, lies in the fact that the individual, in  forming the view of life proper to the new period of life on which  he is entering and the conduct resulting from it, benefits by the  experience of men who have lived before him, who have already  passed through the stage of growth upon which he is entering.  But  humanity cannot have this aid, because it is always moving along a  hitherto untrodden track, and has no one to ask how to understand  life, and to act in the conditions on which it is entering and  through which no one has ever passed before.    Nevertheless, just as a man with wife and children cannot continue  to look at life as he looked at it when he was a child, so too in  the face of the various changes that are taking place, the greater  density of population, the establishment of communication between  different peoples, the improvements of the methods of the struggle  with nature, and the accumulation of knowledge, humanity cannot  continue to look at life as of old, and it must frame a new  theory of life, from which conduct may follow adapted to the new  conditions on which it has entered and is entering.    To meet this need humanity has the special power of producing men  who give a new meaning to the whole of human life--a theory of  life from which follow new forms of activity quite different from  all preceding them.  The formation of this philosophy of life  appropriate to humanity in the new conditions on which it is  entering, and of the practice resulting from it, is what is called  religion.    And therefore, in the first place, religion is not, as science  imagines, a manifestation which at one time corresponded with the  development of humanity, but is afterward outgrown by it.  It is a  manifestation always inherent in the life of humanity, and is as  indispensable, as inherent in humanity at the present time as at  any other.  Secondly, religion is always the theory of the  practice of the future and not of the past, and therefore it is  clear that investigation of past manifestations cannot in any case  grasp the essence of religion.    The essence of every religious teaching lies not in the desire for  a symbolic expression of the forces of nature, nor in the dread of  these forces, nor in the craving for the marvelous, nor in the  external forms in which it is manifested, as men of science  imagine; the essence of religion lies in the faculty of men of  foreseeing and pointing out the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#18)"],[1,"moaned in the branches of the pine-tree,  and rustled in the flowering yews which guarded the entrance of the  passage.    Up and down the hillside we could see the peasants returning from  their work in the fields, and the whole world was caught in the  sudden glory of the setting sun. A woman came towards us with the  key of the tomb; she had a baby in her arms, and on her head a  great mottled pitcher, green and gold, full of spring water. The  sunlight wove a halo round her till she seemed as radiant as one of  Pinturicchio's Madonnas.    The great doors of travertine groaned as they swung slowly open  on their stone pivots, and a scorpion fled from the light. Dennis  says, 'There can be no doubt of the antiquity of these doors; it is  manifest in their very arrangement; for the lintel is a huge mass  of rock buried beneath a weight of superincumbent earth, and must  have been laid _after_ the slabs were in their place.'    This sepulchre, like most Etruscan tombs of importance, is divided  into several chambers. Its roof is curiously coffered, and was  at one time painted red and black. But it is the wall paintings  which are of supreme interest here. Unlike the other tombs of  Chiusi the sandstone walls have been whitened, and even so the  figures are hardly distinguishable. But look close. It is worth  the trouble, for as your candlelight drives the shadows back, the  story of an ancient world unfolds itself. Here, to the right, three  charioteers urge their archaic steeds to the winning-post; here  are the wrestlers; here the musicians with their doublepipes and  lutes, and here a dancing girl. On the other wall you can trace  the progress of a banquet, and see the languid youths of Etruria  reclining on couches, toying with wreaths and flowers, and holding  out their _paterae_ for the hurrying slaves to fill with wine.    But they are very faded. They are a world of shadows; they  vanish with the months. Another generation will look for them in  vain; then the athletes will no longer run their silent races to  eternity, the music will be hushed, and the feet of the dancers  stilled. And then, I suppose, the wonderful old doors will be taken  away, and the angry scorpions will be left in possession. If you  would see these ghosts, come soon. For if you come ten years after,  perchance you will find nothing on the cold stone walls; their  pictures will have gone the way of all the other antique graces  which have been lost in Time's devouring maw!    In Italy, especially in the small cities, you have to bow to local  convention. In Chiusi it takes the form of Etruscan tombs. Every  one from tiny children to the oldest inhabitant volunteers to be  your guide. A stranger would say that the Tomb of the Monkey or  the Deposito del Gran Duca were topics of burning interest in the  town, for the people will not rest until they are assured that he  has visited them. It was for this reason that the sunrise next  morning found us on our way to the Tomba della Scimmia, which lies  a mile or so to the north-east of Chiusi. At first we followed  the highroad where the gay painted ox-carts of Clusium, with their  picturesque high-curved shafts, were already rolling up the hill.  But our way soon turned off into a rough path which dipped down  into the chilly sweetness of the olive-gardens. The sun had not  yet risen high enough to penetrate these dewy hollows, but as we  re-emerged from them and breasted the little oak-clad hills beyond,  it slanted between the branches and made a halo round some young  peasant girls, barefoot and with uncovered heads, who were carrying  great pitchers of water to their cottages from an Artesian well.  We dipped into more valleys and circled other hills, plucking the  ripe blackberries as we passed, and gathering the flowers which  made a tangle round our feet. The only people that we met were  peasants at work below their olives, and every one of them gave us  a smiling _buon giorno a loro_ as we passed. Presently we came out  upon a wooded cliff and saw Chiusi, with her fair white houses and  her grey ivied rocca, across the valley to our right, and on our  left the little lakes of Montepulciano and Chiusi, like opals in  the dawn. Umbria again! The flowers at our feet, the glint of water  in the wide green valley, the purple hills, the soft blue sky, the  breadth and depth, the holiness and peace of mystic Umbria.    [Illustration: CHIUSI: THE PALACE OF THE BISHOP.]    The Tomb of the Monkey owes its name to the painted monkey chained  to a tree in the midst of the athletes who wrestle and ride and box  and perform their Pyrrhic dances round the walls. It is approached  by a deep cut in the tufa, in the style of the mummy shafts of  Egypt, but the steps which lead down to the door, and the door  itself, are modern. By the help of our guttering candles we were  able to decipher the solitary spectator who sits, like Nefertari  in her rock-hewn tomb of Thebes, with foot on stool and umbrella  over head, gazing into eternity. But we did not stay there long. It  was too cold. The damp had eaten almost everything away. Down in  the chill dark of the tomb we knew that the wrestlers, their naked  red bodies fading into the tufa, wrestled continuously, and the  chariots drove silently into the shadows before the solemn audience  of one.    But up above we could hear the bells of Chiusi on the warm,  scented air. And there were the wind, the limpid sunlight, the  song of birds, the wooded hills and valleys, the yellow earth  with its flowers and its trails of bramble covered with shining  fruits--everything of warmth and sweetness and pleasure to the  eye and ear. In the plain below we could see the little blue lake  of Chiusi, called lovingly of the people, the 'chiaro di Chiusi,'  which in the olden days was yearly espoused with a ring by the  chief magistrate of the town, in the same manner as the Doge of  Venice wedded the Adriatic. And beside it the towers of Beccati  Questo and Beccati Quest'altro, which were put up in the fifteenth  century by the rival provinces of Siena and Perugia, still shout  defiance to each other across the valley.    After all, it was for her old-world charm that we loved Chiusi--the  simple pastoral beauty of her _contado_, her forges glowing at  night in deep caverns below her walls, her Bishop's palace with  its ancient _cippi_, and its flowering agaves and cypresses. And  most of all we loved the lichen-covered boy in the fountain of the  Piazza del Duomo. For he was like the spirit of eternal youth,  keeping the soul of things alive in this city of tombs. There  were gold fish in the green shallows round his feet, the water  spouted from his forehead, his arms were outstretched and his face  upturned, as though he sang in rapture to the sun.    For it was in such little things as these that we found the  hidden secret of Italy's charm. These little towns like Chiusi,  perched each one on its hill, are sometimes commonplace enough  in themselves, even though their foundations are inscribed by  the years that have passed; but they look across valleys of  unimaginable beauty to the mountains; they have genii singing in  their springs; and the lives of their people have the classic  simplicity of an older, unspoilt world.          HANNIBAL'S THRASYMENE      'Yea! sometimes on the instant all seems plain,    The simple sun could tell us, or the rain,      The world caught dreaming with a look of heaven    Seems on a sudden tip-toe to explain.'                              'THE RUBAIYAT,' Le Gallienne's translation.      We came to Passignano from Chiusi, because we could not resist the  beauty of Thrasymene. Most travellers in Italy only view it with  passing admiration as they fly by in the express which takes them  from Florence to Rome and Naples. It is to them merely another  lovely incident in their journey through a landscape of surpassing  beauty. Perchance they refer to their Baedekers, and find that it  was the scene of Hannibal's great victory over Flaminius, and in a  few minutes more their train is in Chiusi Junction, and the lake  is lost behind the Umbrian hills. Others, who visit Perugia and  Assisi, see more of its beauties, for when they leave the main line  at Chiusi they have to make a semi-circular tour of the lake; and  even from Terontola, the junction for Florence and Perugia, the  line runs for miles along the lake-side, and crosses the actual  site of Hannibal's battle-field.    Twice already, in the last month, we had traversed it, on the  journey from Cortona to Perugia, and again on our way to Siena.  Coming back we could no more resist it. Our intention had been to  go straight from Chiusi to Assisi, but at Terontola the little  philosopher put in a special plea for Thrasymene. He has a passion  for lakes and rivers; no landscape is complete for him without them.    'Let us go down to Thrasymene,' he said. 'Not for the sake of  Hannibal, but for the pleasure of its beauty. For I am sick of the  petty wars of hill-towns, and am wearied for the moment of Etruscan  tombs and Gothic palaces and churches. Let us go forth into the  field; let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the  vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender  grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth!'    So we came to Thrasymene and Passignano, which is a mere handful  of brown houses pushed into the water at the foot of a rocky hill.  Passignano has a flavour of its own. To begin with, its inn is  different from any other albergo in Italy. It has an old-fashioned  kitchen with a cowl chimney and rows of shining brass saucepans,  and it opens on to the village street, where the people sit to  gossip while the evening meal is cooking. Its low cottage windows  look over the wide expanse of water to towered Castiglione, and  the wooded islands of Thrasymene; but it is built so close into  the hillside at the back that you can"]]]
