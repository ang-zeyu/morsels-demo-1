It was during this  period that he found inspiration and encouragement in the study of the  lives of Frederick and Napoleon, besides acquiring a knowledge of music  and shorthand.    When in 1876 Butler quitted Australia for New Zealand, he was  sufficiently accomplished to obtain employment as a schoolmaster.    At Cromwell, Otago, under the name of \"C. J. Donelly, Esq.,\" Butler  opened a \"Commercial and Preparatory Academy,\" and in a prospectus that  recalls Mr. Squeers' famous advertisement of Dotheboys Hall, announced  that the programme of the Academy would include \"reading, taught as  an art and upon the most approved principles of elocution, writing,  arithmetic, euclid, algebra, mensuration, trigonometry, book-keeping,  geography, grammar, spelling and dictation, composition, logic and  debate, French, Latin, shorthand, history, music, and general lectures  on astronomy, natural philosophy, geology, and other subjects.\" The  simpler principles of these branches of learning were to be \"rendered  intelligible, and a firm foundation laid for the acquirement of future  knowledge.\" Unfortunately a suspicion of theft on Butler's part cut  short the fulfilment of this really splendid programme, and Butler left  Cromwell hurriedly for the ampler field of Dunedin. There, less than a  fortnight after his arrivel{sic}, he was sentenced to four years' hard  labour for several burglaries committed in and about that city.    On the 18th of February, 1880, Butler was released from prison. With  that consummate hypocrisy which was part of the man, he had contrived to  enlist the sympathies of the Governor of the Dunedin Jail, who gave  him, on his departure, a suit of clothes and a small sum of money.  A detective of the name of Bain tried to find him employment. Butler  wished to adopt a literary career. He acted as a reporter on the Dunedin  Evening Star, and gave satisfaction to the editor of that newspaper. An  attempt to do some original work, in the shape of \"Prison Sketches,\"  for another newspaper, was less successful. Bain had arranged for the  publication of the articles in the Sunday Advertiser, but when the time  came to deliver his manuscript, Butler failed to appear. Bain, whose  duty it was to keep an eye on Butler, found him in the street looking  wild and haggard. He said that he had found the work \"too much for his  head,\" that he had torn up what he had written, that he had nowhere to  go, and had been to the end of the jetty with the intention of drowning  himself. Bain replied somewhat caustically that he thought it a pity he  had not done so, as nothing would have given him greater joy than  going to the end of the jetty and identifying his body. \"You speak  very plainly,\" said Butler. \"Yes, and what is more, I mean what I say,\"  replied Bain. Butler justified Bain's candour by saying that if he broke  out again, he would be worse than the most savage tiger ever let loose  on the community. As a means of obviating such an outbreak, Butler  suggested that, intellectual employment having failed, some form of  manual labour should be found him. Bain complied with Butler's request,  and got him a job at levelling reclaimed ground in the neighbourhood of  Dunedin. On Wednesday, March 10, Butler started work, but after three  hours of it relinquished the effort. Bain saw Butler again in Dunedin on  the evening of Saturday, March 13, and made an appointment to meet him  at half-past eight that night. Butler did not keep the appointment. Bain  searched the town for him, but he was nowhere to be found.    About the same time Butler had some talk with another member of the  Dunedin police force, Inspector Mallard. They discussed the crimes of  Charles Peace and other notable artists of that kind. Butler remarked to  Mallard how easy it would be to destroy all traces of a murder by fire,  and asked the inspector whether if he woke up one morning to find some  brutal murder had been committed, he would not put it down to him. \"No,  Butler,\" replied the inspector, \"the first thing I should do would be to  look for suspicious circumstances, and most undoubtedly, if they pointed  to you, you would be looked after.\"    In the early morning of this Saturday, March 13, the house of a Mr.  Stamper, a solicitor of Dunedin, had been broken into, and some articles  of value, among them a pair of opera glasses, stolen. The house had been  set on fire, and burned to the ground. On the morning of the following  day, Sunday, the 14th, Dunedin was horrified by the discovery of a far  more terrible crime, tigerish certainly in its apparent ferocity. In a  house in Cumberland Street, a young married couple and their little baby  were cruelly murdered and un{sic}{an??} unsuccessful attempt made to  fire the scene of the crime.    About half-past six on Sunday morning a man of the name of Robb, a  carpenter, on getting out of bed, noticed smoke coming from the house  of a neighbor of his, Mr. J. M. Dewar, who occupied a small one-floored  cottage standing by itself in Cumberland Street, a large and broad  thoroughfare on the outskirts of the town. Dewar was a butcher by trade,  a young man, some eighteen months married, and father of a baby girl.  Robb, on seeing smoke coming from Dewar's house, woke his son, who was  a member of the fire brigade. The latter got up, crossed the street,  and going round to the back door, which he found wide open, entered the  house. As he went along the passage that separated the two front rooms,  a bedroom and sitting-room, he called to the inmates to get up. He  received no answer, but as he neared the bedroom he heard a \"gurgling\"  sound. Crawling on his hands and knees he reached the bedroom door, and  two feet inside it his right hand touched something. It was the body of  a woman; she was still alive, but in a dying condition. Robb dragged  her across the passage into the sitting-room. He got some water, and  extinguished the fire in the bedroom. On the bed lay the body of Dewar.  To all appearances he had been killed in his sleep. By his side was  the body of the baby, suffocated by the smoke. Near the bed was an  axe belonging to Dewar, stained with blood. It was with this weapon,  apparently, that Mr. and Mrs. Dewar had been attacked. Under the bed was  a candlestick belonging also to the Dewars, which had been used by  the murderer in setting fire to the bed. The front window of the  sitting-room was open, there were marks of boot nails on the sill, and  on the grass in front of the window a knife was found. An attempt  had been made to ransack a chest of drawers in the bedroom, but some  articles of jewellery lying in one of the drawers, and a ring on the  dressing-table had been left untouched. As far as was known, Mr. and  Mrs. Dewar were a perfectly happy and united couple. Dewar had been last  seen alive about ten o'clock on the Saturday night getting off a car  near his home. At eleven a neighbour had noticed a light in the Dewars'  house. About five o'clock on the Sunday morning another neighbour  had been aroused from his sleep by the sound as of something falling  heavily. It was a wild and boisterous night. Thinking the noise might be  the slamming of his stable door, he got up and went out to see that  it was secure. He then noticed that a light was burning in the bedroom  window of the Dewars' cottage.    Nothing more was known of what had occurred that morning until at  half-past six Robb saw the smoke coming from Dewars' house. Mrs. Dewar,  who alone could have told something, never recovered consciousness  and died on the day following the crime. Three considerable wounds  sufficient to cause death had been inflicted on the unfortunate woman's  head, and five of a similar character on that of her husband. At the  head of the bed, which stood in the corner of the room, there was a  large smear of blood on the wall just above the door; there were spots  of blood all over the top of the bed, and some smaller ones that had to  all appearances spurted on to the panel of the door nearest to the bed.    The investigation of this shocking crime was placed in the hands of  Detective Bain, whose duty it had been to keep an eye on Robert Butler,  but he did not at first associate his interesting charge with the  commission of the murder. About half-past six on Sunday evening Bain  happened to go to a place called the Scotia Hotel, where the landlord  informed him that one of his servants, a girl named Sarah Gillespie, was  very anxious to see him. Her story was this: On the morning of Thursday,  March 11, Robert Butler had come to the hotel; he was wearing a dark  lavender check suit and carried a top coat and parcel. Butler had stayed  in the hotel all Thursday and slept there that night. He had not slept  in the hotel on the Friday night, and Sarah Gillespie had not seen him  again until he came into the house about five and twenty minutes to  seven on Sunday morning. The girl noticed that he was pale and excited,  seemed afraid and worried, as if someone were coming after him. After  giving her some money for the landlord, he went upstairs, fetched his  top coat, a muffler, and his parcel. Before leaving he said he would  have a pint of beer, as he had not breakfasted. He then left, presumably  to catch an early train.    Butler was next seen a few minutes later at a shop near the hotel, where  he bought five tins of salmon, and about the same time a milk-boy saw  him standing on the kerb in Cumberland Street in a stooping position,  his head turned in the direction of Dewars' house. A little after ten  the same night Butler entered a hotel at a place called Blueskin, some  twelve miles distant from Dunedin. He was wearing an overcoat and a  light muffler. He sat down at a table in the dining-room and seemed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#18)"],[1,"factors--that is, if we remember that pleasure,  like pain, cannot exceed certain limits, and that all sensations,  when too violent, result in the paralysis of sensation.  Our  organism can only support a certain maximum of joy, pain, or  effort, and it cannot support that maximum for long together.  The hand which grasps a dynamometer soon exhausts its effort, and  is obliged suddenly to let go.    The study of the causes of the rapid disappearance of certain  groups of sentiments in assemblies will remind us of the fact  that beside the party which is predominant by means of its  strength or prestige there are others whose sentiments,  restrained by this force or prestige, have not reached their full  development.  Some chance circumstance may somewhat weaken the  prevailing party, when immediately the suppressed sentiments of  the adverse parties may become preponderant.  The Mountain  learned this lesson after Thermidor.    All analogies that we may seek to establish between the laws of  material phenomena and those which condition the evolution of  affective and mystic factors are evidently extremely rough.  They  must be so until the mechanism of the cerebral functions is  better understood than it is to-day.          PART II    THE FRENCH REVOLUTION      BOOK I    THE ORIGINS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION    CHAPTER I    THE OPINIONS OF HISTORIANS CONCERNING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION    1.  The Historians of the Revolution.    The most contradictory opinions have been expressed respecting  the French Revolution, and although only a century separates us  from the period in question it seems impossible as yet to judge  it calmly.  For de Maistre it was ``a satanic piece of work,''  and ``never was the action of the spirit of darkness so evidently  manifested.''  For the modern Jacobins it has regenerated the  human race.    Foreigners who live in France still regard it as a subject to be  avoided in conversation.    ``Everywhere,'' writes Barrett Wendell, ``this memory and these  traditions are still endowed with such vitality that few persons  are capable of considering them dispassionately.  They still  excite both enthusiasm and resentment; they are still regarded  with a loyal and ardent spirit of partisanship.  The better you  come to understand France the more clearly you see that even to-  day no study of the Revolution strikes any Frenchman as  having been impartial.''    This observation is perfectly correct.  To be interpretable with  equity, the events of the past must no longer be productive of  results and must not touch the religious or political beliefs  whose inevitable intolerance I have denoted.    We must not therefore be surprised that historians express very  different ideas respecting the Revolution.  For a long time to  come some will still see in it one of the most sinister events of  history, while to others it will remain one of the most glorious.    All writers on the subject have believed that they have related  its course with impartiality, but in general they have merely  supported contradictory theories of peculiar simplicity.  The  documents being innumerable and contradictory, their conscious or  unconscious choice has readily enabled them to justify their  respective theories.    The older historians of the Revolution--Thiers, Quinet, and,  despite his talent, Michelet himself, are somewhat eclipsed to-  day.  Their doctrines were by no means complicated; a historic  fatalism prevails generally in their work.  Thiers regarded the  Revolution as the result of several centuries of absolute  monarchy, and the Terror as the necessary consequence of foreign  invasion.  Quinet described the excesses of 1793 as the result of  a long-continued despotism, but declared that the tyranny of the  Convention was unnecessary, and hampered the work of the  Revolution.  Michelet saw in this last merely the work of the  people, whom he blindly admired, and commenced the glorification  continued by other historians.    The former reputation of all these historians has been to a great  extent effaced by that of Taine.  Although equally impassioned,  he threw a brilliant light upon the revolutionary period, and it  will doubtless be long before his work is superseded.    Work so important is bound to show faults.  Taine is admirable in  the representation of facts and persons, but he attempts to judge  by the standard of rational logic events which were not dictated  by reason, and which, therefore, he cannot interpret.  His  psychology, excellent when it is merely descriptive, is very weak  as soon as it becomes explanatory.  To affirm that Robespierre  was a pedantic ``swotter'' is not to reveal the causes of his  absolute power over the Convention, at a time when he had spent  several months in decimating it with perfect impunity.  It has  very justly been said of Taine that he saw well and understood  little.    Despite these restrictions his work is highly remarkable and has  not been equalled.  We may judge of his immense influence by the  exasperation which he causes among the faithful defenders of  Jacobin orthodoxy, of which M. Aulard, professor at the Sorbonne,  is to-day the high priest.  The latter has devoted two years to  writing a pamphlet against Taine, every line of which is steeped  in passion.  All this time spent in rectifying a few material  errors which are not really significant has only resulted in the  perpetration of the very same errors.    Reviewing his work, M. A. Cochin shows that M. Aulard has at  least on every other occasion been deceived by his quotations,  whereas Taine erred far more rarely.  The same historian shows  also that we must not trust M. Aulard's sources.    ``These sources--proceedings, pamphlets, journals, and the  speeches and writings of patriots--are precisely the authentic  publications of patriotism, edited by patriots, and edited, as a  rule, for the benefit of the public.  He ought to have seen in  all this simply the special pleading of the defendant: he had,  before his eyes, a ready-made history of the Revolution, which  presents, side by side with each of the acts of the `People,'  from the massacres of September to the law of Prairial, a ready-  made explanation according to the republican system of defence.''    Perhaps the fairest criticism that one can make of the work of  Taine is that it was left incomplete.  He studied more especially  the role of the populace and its leaders during the  revolutionary period.  This inspired him with pages vibrating  with an indignation which we can still admire, but several  important aspects of the Revolution escaped him.    Whatever one may think of the Revolution, an irreducible  difference will always exist between historians of the school of  Taine and those of the school of M. Aulard.  The latter regards  the sovereign people as admirable, while the former shows us that  when abandoned to its instincts and liberated from all social  restraint it relapses into primitive savagery.  The conception of  M. Aulard, entirely contrary to the lessons of the psychology of  crowds, is none the less a religious dogma in the eyes of modern  Jacobins.  They write of the Revolution according to the methods  of believers, and take for learned works the arguments of virtual  theologians.    2.  The Theory of Fatalism in respect of the Revolution.      Advocates and detractors of the Revolution often admit the  fatality of revolutionary events.  This theory is well  synthetised in the following passage from the History of the  Revolution, by Emile Olivier:--    ``No man could oppose it.  The blame belongs neither to those who  perished nor to those who survived; there was no individual force  capable of changing the elements and of foreseeing the events  which were born of the nature of things and circumstances.''    Taine himself inclines to this idea:--    ``At the moment when the States General were opened the course of  ideas and events was not only determined but even visible.  Each  generation unwittingly bears within itself its future and its  past; from the latter its destinies might have been foretold long  before the issue.''    Other modern authors, who profess no more indulgence for the  violence of the revolutionaries than did Taine, are equally  convinced of this fatality.  M. Sorel, after recalling the saying  of Bossuet concerning the revolutions of antiquity:  ``Everything  is surprising if we only consider particular causes, and yet  everything goes forward in regular sequence,'' expresses an  intention which he very imperfectly realises: ``to show in the  Revolution, which seems to some the subversion and to others the  regeneration of the old European world, the natural and necessary  result of the history of Europe, and to show, moreover, that this  revolution had no result--not even the most unexpected--that did  not ensue from this history, and was not explained by the  precedents of the ancien regime.''    Guizot also had formerly attempted to prove that our Revolution,  which he quite wrongly compared to that of England, was perfectly  natural and effected no innovations:--    ``Far from having broken with the natural course of events in  Europe, neither the English revolution nor our own did, intended,  or said anything that had not been said, intended, and done a  hundred years before its outbreak.    `` . . . Whether we regard the general doctrines of the two  revolutions or the application made of them--whether we deal with  the government of the State or with the civil legislation, with  property or with persons, with liberty or with power, we shall  find nothing of which the invention can be attributed to them,  nothing that will not be encountered elsewhere, or that was not  at least originated in times which we qualify as normal.''    All these assertions merely recall the banal law that a  phenomenon is simply the consequence of previous phenomena.  Such  very general "]]]
