[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#18)"],[1,"I was  about to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by  my side.\"    She is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me  with her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten  and flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who  serves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is  only now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of  countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn  out of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,  and, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before  Wanda leaps up in a rage.    \"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you  like her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"    I am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is  suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in  Furs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and  strikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind  me, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a  dark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.    Then the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings  in the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.    I have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf  about to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,  without any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It  would be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to  death before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe  I am beginning to hate this woman.           *       *       *       *       *    A red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light  falling through the door which is now thrust open.    Wanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a  lighted torch.    \"Are you still alive?\" she asks.    \"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.    With two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside  me, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,  do you love me? I want you to love me.\"    She draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade  gleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to  kill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.           *       *       *       *       *    Every evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to  her, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and  subjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were  ashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty  with which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her  entire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a  superhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind  which calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the  miseries of existence and all the terrors of death.           *       *       *       *       *    I am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she  doesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she  shuts up the little book.    \"Don't you want to go on reading?\"    \"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a  rendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany  me; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"    \"You command it.\"    \"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible  charm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at  me.    \"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea  how I love you!\"    \"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have  arranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"    \"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I  must have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose  you, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"    She clung passionately to my lips.    \"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--  thus--but now come.\"    She slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_  [Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went  through the gallery, and entered the carriage.    \"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in  surprise.    I ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.    In the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda  got out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray  clouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man  in a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow  waves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on  the shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they  disappeared behind the green wall.    An hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes  to one side, and they returned.    The man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell  full and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face  which I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.    She held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she  signaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy  wall which follows the river like a long green screen.           *       *       *       *       *    The bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man  from the Cascine.    \"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his  head.    \"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.    \"Yes. Your name, please.\"    \"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your  mistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--  but there she is herself.\"    Wanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.    \"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.    I showed the painter the stairs.    \"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the  steps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the  poor German.    Venus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will  paint her, and go mad.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles  on the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level  of the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious  in their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is  drawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded  as in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,  and is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.    But she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the  spade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may  see her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like  poetry, like music.           *       *       *       *       *    The painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.  I go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the  painter, mistress?\"    She looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally  even smiles.    \"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no  one. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as  it was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any  more; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"    \"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.    \"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when  you have reached that point, and I will give back to you your  freedom.\"    \"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you  and shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of  love which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.    Wanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you  do,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic  towards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old  feeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my  breast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give  you your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,  merciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical  pleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships  me idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;  perhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider  this well.\"    \"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of  fever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you  set me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not  drive me away.\"    \"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that  I no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than  a dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"           *       *       *       *       *    To-day I visited the Venus of Medici.    It was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was  filled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands  in deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.    But I did not stand for long.    Not a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I  fell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the  budding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant  curls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.           *       *       *       *       *    My mistress's bell.    It is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined  behind her neck.    \"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"    I obey.    \"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#18)"],[1,"was going on? Was he holding the  watch?\"    \"The watch?\" said Mr Kay, in a puzzled tone of voice. \"Kennedy was  over at the gymnasium when it occurred.\"    \"Then it was hardly his fault that the fight took place.\"    \"My dear Mulholland, if the head of a house is efficient, fights  should be impossible. Even when he is not present, his influence, his  prestige, so to speak, should be sufficient to restrain the boys under  him.\"    Mr Mulholland whistled softly.    \"So that's your idea of what the head of your house should be like, is  it? Well, I know of one fellow who would have been just your man.  Unfortunately, he is never likely to come to school at Eckleton.\"    \"Indeed?\" said Mr Kay, with interest. \"Who is that? Where did you meet  him? What school is he at?\"    \"I never said I had met him. I only go by what I have heard of him.  And as far as I know, he is not at any school. He was a gentleman of  the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. He might just have been equal to the  arduous duties which devolve upon the head of your house. Goodnight.\"    And Fenn heard his footsteps crunch the gravel as he walked away. A  minute later the front door shut, and there was a rattle. Mr Kay had  put the chain up and retired for the night.    Fenn lay where he was for a short while longer. Then he rose, feeling  very stiff and wet, and crept into one of the summer-houses which  stood in Mr Kay's garden. Here he sat for an hour and a half, at the  end of which time, thinking that Mr Kay must be asleep, he started out  to climb into the house.    His study was on the first floor. A high garden-seat stood directly  beneath the window and acted as a convenient ladder. It was easy to  get from this on to the window-ledge. Once there he could open the  window, and the rest would be plain sailing.    Unhappily, there was one flaw in his scheme. He had conceived that  scheme in the expectation that the window would be as he had left it.    But it was not.    During his absence somebody had shot the bolt. And, try his hardest,  he could not move the sash an inch.          XVII    FENN HUNTS FOR HIMSELF      Nobody knows for certain the feelings of the camel when his proprietor  placed that last straw on his back. The incident happened so long ago.  If it had occurred in modern times, he would probably have contributed  a first-hand report to the _Daily Mail._ But it is very likely  that he felt on that occasion exactly as Fenn felt when, after a night  of unparalleled misadventure, he found that somebody had cut off his  retreat by latching the window. After a gruelling race Fate had just  beaten him on the tape.    There was no doubt about its being latched. The sash had not merely  stuck. He put all he knew into the effort to raise it, but without a  hint of success. After three attempts he climbed down again and,  sitting on the garden-seat, began to review his position.    If one has an active mind and a fair degree of optimism, the effect of  the \"staggerers\" administered by Fate passes off after a while. Fenn  had both. The consequence was that, after ten minutes of grey despair,  he was relieved by a faint hope that there might be some other way  into the house than through his study. Anyhow, it would be worth while  to investigate.    His study was at the side of the house. At the back were the kitchen,  the scullery, and the dining-room, and above these more studies and a  couple of dormitories. As a last resort he might fling rocks and other  solids at the windows until he woke somebody up. But he did not feel  like trying this plan until every other had failed. He had no desire  to let a garrulous dormitory into the secret of his wanderings. What  he hoped was that he might find one of the lower windows open.    And so he did.    As he turned the corner of the house he saw what he had been looking  for. The very first window was wide open. His spirits shot up, and for  the first time since he had left the theatre he was conscious of  taking a pleasure in his adventurous career. Fate was with him after  all. He could not help smiling as he remembered how he had felt during  that ten minutes on the garden-seat, when the future seemed blank and  devoid of any comfort whatsoever. And all the time he could have got  in without an effort, if he had only thought of walking half a dozen  yards.    Now that the way was open to him, he wasted no time. He climbed  through into the dark room. He was not certain which room it was, in  spite of his lengthy residence at Kay's.    He let himself down softly till his foot touched the floor. After a  moment's pause he moved forward a step. Then another. At the third  step his knee struck the leg of a table. He must be in the  dining-room. If so, he was all right. He could find his way up to his  room with his eyes shut. It was easy to find out for certain. The  walls of the dining-room at Kay's, as in the other houses, were  covered with photographs. He walked gingerly in the direction in which  he imagined the nearest wall to be, reached it, and passed his hand  along it. Yes, there were photographs. Then all he had to do was to  find the table again, make his way along it, and when he got to the  end the door would be a yard or so to his left. The programme seemed  simple and attractive. But it was added to in a manner which he had  not foreseen. Feeling his way back to the table, he upset a chair. If  he had upset a cart-load of coal on to a sheet of tin it could not, so  it seemed to him in the disordered state of his nerves, have made more  noise. It went down with an appalling crash, striking the table on its  way. \"This,\" thought Fenn, savagely, as he waited, listening, \"is  where I get collared. What a fool I am to barge about like this.\"    He felt that the echoes of that crash must have penetrated to every  corner of the house. But no one came. Perhaps, after all, the noise  had not been so great. He proceeded on his journey down the table,  feeling every inch of the way. The place seemed one bristling mass of  chairs. But, by the exercise of consummate caution, he upset no more  and won through at last in safety to the door.    It was at this point that the really lively and exciting part of his  adventure began. Compared with what was to follow, his evening had  been up to the present dull and monotonous.    As he opened the door there was a sudden stir and crash at the other  end of the room. Fenn had upset one chair and the noise had nearly  deafened him. Now chairs seemed to be falling in dozens. Bang! Bang!  Crash!! (two that time). And then somebody shot through the window  like a harlequin and dashed away across the lawn. Fenn could hear his  footsteps thudding on the soft turf. And at the same moment other  footsteps made themselves heard.    Somebody was coming downstairs.    \"Who is that? Is anybody there?\"    It was Mr Kay's voice, unmistakably nervous. Fenn darted from the door  and across the passage. At the other side was a boot-cupboard. It was  his only refuge in that direction. What he ought to have done was to  leave the dining-room by the opposite door, which led _via_ a  corridor to the junior dayroom. But he lost his head, and instead of  bolting away from the enemy, went towards him.    The stairs down which Mr Kay was approaching were at the end of the  passage. To reach the dining-room one turned to the right. Beyond the  stairs on the left the passage ended in a wall, so that Mr Kay was  bound to take the right direction in the search. Fenn wondered if he  had a pistol. Not that he cared very much. If the house-master was  going to find him, it would be very little extra discomfort to be shot  at. And Mr Kay's talents as a marksman were in all probability limited  to picking off sitting haystacks. The important point was that he had  a candle. A faint yellow glow preceded him down the stairs. Playing  hide-and-seek with him in the dark, Fenn might have slipped past in  safety; but the candle made that impossible.    He found the boot-room door and slipped through just as Mr Kay turned  the corner. With a thrill of pleasure he found that there was a key  inside. He turned it as quietly as he could, but nevertheless it  grated. Having done this, and seeing nothing else that he could do  except await developments, he sat down on the floor among the boots.  It was not a dignified position for a man who had played for his  county while still at school, but just then he would not have  exchanged it for a throne--if the throne had been placed in the  passage or the dining-room.    The only question was--had he been seen or heard? He thought not; but  his heart began to beat furiously as the footsteps stopped outside the  cupboard door and unseen fingers rattled the handle.    Twice Mr Kay tried the handle, but, finding the cupboard locked,  passed on into the dining-room. The light of the candle ceased to  shine under the door, and Fenn was once more in inky darkness.    He listened intently. A minute later he had made his second mistake.  Instead of waiting, as he should have done, until Mr Kay had retired  for good, he unlocked the door directly he had passed, and when a  muffled crash told him that the house-master was in the dining-room  among the chairs, out he came and fled softly upstairs towards his  bedroom. He thought that Mr Kay might possibly take it into his head  to go round the dormitories to make certain that all the members of  his house were in. In which case all would be discovered.    When he reached his room he began to fling off his clothes with  feverish haste. Once in bed all would be well.    He had got out of his boots, his coat, and his waistcoat, and was  beginning to feel that electric sensation of triumph which only conies  to the man who _just_ pulls through, when he heard Mr Kay coming  down the corridor towards his room. The burglar-hunter, returning from  the dining-room in the full belief that the miscreant had escaped  "]]]
