[Illustration: I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing  chariots.]    My duty dictated that I must see that she was comfortable, and so I  glanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs.  In doing  so I noted with horror that she was heavily chained by one ankle to the  side of the vehicle.    \"What does this mean?\" I cried, turning to Sola.    \"Sarkoja thought it best,\" she answered, her face betokening her  disapproval of the procedure.    Examining the manacles I saw that they fastened with a massive spring  lock.    \"Where is the key, Sola?  Let me have it.\"    \"Sarkoja wears it, John Carter,\" she answered.    I turned without further word and sought out Tars Tarkas, to whom I  vehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties, as  they seemed to my lover's eyes, that were being heaped upon Dejah  Thoris.    \"John Carter,\" he answered, \"if ever you and Dejah Thoris escape the  Tharks it will be upon this journey.  We know that you will not go  without her.  You have shown yourself a mighty fighter, and we do not  wish to manacle you, so we hold you both in the easiest way that will  yet ensure security.  I have spoken.\"    I saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash, and knew that it was  futile to appeal from his decision, but I asked that the key be taken  from Sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the prisoner alone in  future.    \"This much, Tars Tarkas, you may do for me in return for the friendship  that, I must confess, I feel for you.\"    \"Friendship?\" he replied.  \"There is no such thing, John Carter; but  have your will.  I shall direct that Sarkoja cease to annoy the girl,  and I myself will take the custody of the key.\"    \"Unless you wish me to assume the responsibility,\" I said, smiling.    He looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke.    \"Were you to give me your word that neither you nor Dejah Thoris would  attempt to escape until after we have safely reached the court of Tal  Hajus you might have the key and throw the chains into the river Iss.\"    \"It was better that you held the key, Tars Tarkas,\" I replied    He smiled, and said no more, but that night as we were making camp I  saw him unfasten Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.    With all his cruel ferocity and coldness there was an undercurrent of  something in Tars Tarkas which he seemed ever battling to subdue.  Could it be a vestige of some human instinct come back from an ancient  forbear to haunt him with the horror of his people's ways!    As I was approaching Dejah Thoris' chariot I passed Sarkoja, and the  black, venomous look she accorded me was the sweetest balm I had felt  for many hours.  Lord, how she hated me!  It bristled from her so  palpably that one might almost have cut it with a sword.    A few moments later I saw her deep in conversation with a warrior named  Zad; a big, hulking, powerful brute, but one who had never made a kill  among his own chieftains, and so was still an _o mad_, or man with  one name; he could win a second name only with the metal of some  chieftain.  It was this custom which entitled me to the names of either  of the chieftains I had killed; in fact, some of the warriors addressed  me as Dotar Sojat, a combination of the surnames of the two warrior  chieftains whose metal I had taken, or, in other words, whom I had  slain in fair fight.    As Sarkoja talked with Zad he cast occasional glances in my direction,  while she seemed to be urging him very strongly to some action.  I paid  little attention to it at the time, but the next day I had good reason  to recall the circumstances, and at the same time gain a slight insight  into the depths of Sarkoja's hatred and the lengths to which she was  capable of going to wreak her horrid vengeance on me.    Dejah Thoris would have none of me again on this evening, and though I  spoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as the  flutter of an eyelid that she realized my existence.  In my extremity I  did what most other lovers would have done; I sought word from her  through an intimate.  In this instance it was Sola whom I intercepted  in another part of camp.    \"What is the matter with Dejah Thoris?\" I blurted out at her.  \"Why  will she not speak to me?\"    Sola seemed puzzled herself, as though such strange actions on the part  of two humans were quite beyond her, as indeed they were, poor child.    \"She says you have angered her, and that is all she will say, except  that she is the daughter of a jed and the granddaughter of a jeddak and  she has been humiliated by a creature who could not polish the teeth of  her grandmother's sorak.\"    I pondered over this report for some time, finally asking, \"What might  a sorak be, Sola?\"    \"A little animal about as big as my hand, which the red Martian women  keep to play with,\" explained Sola.    Not fit to polish the teeth of her grandmother's cat!  I must rank  pretty low in the consideration of Dejah Thoris, I thought; but I could  not help laughing at the strange figure of speech, so homely and in  this respect so earthly.  It made me homesick, for it sounded very much  like \"not fit to polish her shoes.\"  And then commenced a train of  thought quite new to me.  I began to wonder what my people at home were  doing.  I had not seen them for years.  There was a family of Carters  in Virginia who claimed close relationship with me; I was supposed to  be a great uncle, or something of the kind equally foolish.  I could  pass anywhere for twenty-five to thirty years of age, and to be a great  uncle always seemed the height of incongruity, for my thoughts and  feelings were those of a boy.  There were two little kiddies in the  Carter family whom I had loved and who had thought there was no one on  Earth like Uncle Jack; I could see them just as plainly, as I stood  there under the moonlit skies of Barsoom, and I longed for them as I  had never longed for any mortals before.  By nature a wanderer, I had  never known the true meaning of the word home, but the great hall of  the Carters had always stood for all that the word did mean to me, and  now my heart turned toward it from the cold and unfriendly peoples I  had been thrown amongst.  For did not even Dejah Thoris despise me!  I  was a low creature, so low in fact that I was not even fit to polish  the teeth of her grandmother's cat; and then my saving sense of humor  came to my rescue, and laughing I turned into my silks and furs and  slept upon the moon-haunted ground the sleep of a tired and healthy  fighting man.    We broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only a  single halt until just before dark.  Two incidents broke the  tediousness of the march.  About noon we espied far to our right what  was evidently an incubator, and Lorquas Ptomel directed Tars Tarkas to  investigate it.  The latter took a dozen warriors, including myself,  and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the little  enclosure.    It was indeed an incubator, but the eggs were very small in comparison  with those I had seen hatching in ours at the time of my arrival on  Mars.    Tars Tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely, finally  announcing that it belonged to the green men of Warhoon and that the  cement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up.    \"They cannot be a day's march ahead of us,\" he exclaimed, the light of  battle leaping to his fierce face.    The work at the incubator was short indeed.  The warriors tore open the  entrance and a couple of them, crawling in, soon demolished all the  eggs with their short-swords.  Then remounting we dashed back to join  the cavalcade.  During the ride I took occasion to ask Tars Tarkas if  these Warhoons whose eggs we had destroyed were a smaller people than  his Tharks.    \"I noticed that their eggs were so much smaller than those I saw  hatching in your incubator,\" I added.    He explained that the eggs had just been placed there; but, like all  green Martian eggs, they would grow during the five-year period of  incubation until they obtained the size of those I had seen hatching on  the day of my arrival on Barsoom.  This was indeed an interesting piece  of information, for it had always seemed remarkable to me that the  green Martian women, large as they were, could bring forth such  enormous eggs as I had seen the four-foot infants emerging from.  As a  matter of fact, the new-laid egg is but little larger than an ordinary  goose egg, and as it does not commence to grow until subjected to the  light of the sun the chieftains have little difficulty in transporting  several hundreds of them at one time from the storage vaults to the  incubators.    Shortly after the incident of the Warhoon eggs we halted to rest the  animals, and it was during this halt that the second of the day's  interesting episodes occurred.  I was engaged in changing my riding  cloths from one of my thoats to the other, for I divided the day's work  between them, when Zad approached me, and without a word struck my  animal a terrific blow with his long-sword.    I did not need a manual of green Martian etiquette to know what reply  to make, for, in fact, I was so wild with anger that I could scarcely  refrain from drawing my pistol and shooting him down for the brute he  was; but he stood waiting with drawn long-sword, and my only choice was  to draw my own and meet him in fair fight with his choice of weapons or  a lesser one.    This latter alternative is always permissible, therefore I could have  used my short-sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or my fists had I wished,  and been entirely within my rights, but I could not use firearms or a  spear while he held only his long-sword.    I chose the same weapon he had drawn because I knew he prided himself  upon his ability with it, and I wished, if I worsted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#18)"],[1,"our insane, belong to this invalid corps, and bear its  insignia. The strongest often do nearly a man's work, the feeblest, of  course, nothing; but none who can do anything are willing quite to give  up. In their lucid intervals, even our insane are eager to do what they  can.\"    \"That is a pretty idea of the invalid corps,\" I said. \"Even a barbarian  from the nineteenth century can appreciate that. It is a very graceful  way of disguising charity, and must be grateful to the feelings of its  recipients.\"    \"Charity!\" repeated Dr. Leete. \"Did you suppose that we consider the  incapable class we are talking of objects of charity?\"    \"Why, naturally,\" I said, \"inasmuch as they are incapable of  self-support.\"    But here the doctor took me up quickly.    \"Who is capable of self-support?\" he demanded. \"There is no such thing  in a civilized society as self-support. In a state of society so  barbarous as not even to know family cooperation, each individual may  possibly support himself, though even then for a part of his life only;  but from the moment that men begin to live together, and constitute  even the rudest sort of society, self-support becomes impossible. As  men grow more civilized, and the subdivision of occupations and  services is carried out, a complex mutual dependence becomes the  universal rule. Every man, however solitary may seem his occupation, is  a member of a vast industrial partnership, as large as the nation, as  large as humanity. The necessity of mutual dependence should imply the  duty and guarantee of mutual support; and that it did not in your day  constituted the essential cruelty and unreason of your system.\"    \"That may all be so,\" I replied, \"but it does not touch the case of  those who are unable to contribute anything to the product of industry.\"    \"Surely I told you this morning, at least I thought I did,\" replied Dr.  Leete, \"that the right of a man to maintenance at the nation's table  depends on the fact that he is a man, and not on the amount of health  and strength he may have, so long as he does his best.\"    \"You said so,\" I answered, \"but I supposed the rule applied only to the  workers of different ability. Does it also hold of those who can do  nothing at all?\"    \"Are they not also men?\"    \"I am to understand, then, that the lame, the blind, the sick, and the  impotent, are as well off as the most efficient and have the same  income?\"    \"Certainly,\" was the reply.    \"The idea of charity on such a scale,\" I answered, \"would have made our  most enthusiastic philanthropists gasp.\"    \"If you had a sick brother at home,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"unable to  work, would you feed him on less dainty food, and lodge and clothe him  more poorly, than yourself? More likely far, you would give him the  preference; nor would you think of calling it charity. Would not the  word, in that connection, fill you with indignation?\"    \"Of course,\" I replied; \"but the cases are not parallel. There is a  sense, no doubt, in which all men are brothers; but this general sort  of brotherhood is not to be compared, except for rhetorical purposes,  to the brotherhood of blood, either as to its sentiment or its  obligations.\"    \"There speaks the nineteenth century!\" exclaimed Dr. Leete. \"Ah, Mr.  West, there is no doubt as to the length of time that you slept. If I  were to give you, in one sentence, a key to what may seem the mysteries  of our civilization as compared with that of your age, I should say  that it is the fact that the solidarity of the race and the brotherhood  of man, which to you were but fine phrases, are, to our thinking and  feeling, ties as real and as vital as physical fraternity.    \"But even setting that consideration aside, I do not see why it so  surprises you that those who cannot work are conceded the full right to  live on the produce of those who can. Even in your day, the duty of  military service for the protection of the nation, to which our  industrial service corresponds, while obligatory on those able to  discharge it, did not operate to deprive of the privileges of  citizenship those who were unable. They stayed at home, and were  protected by those who fought, and nobody questioned their right to be,  or thought less of them. So, now, the requirement of industrial service  from those able to render it does not operate to deprive of the  privileges of citizenship, which now implies the citizen's maintenance,  him who cannot work. The worker is not a citizen because he works, but  works because he is a citizen. As you recognize the duty of the strong  to fight for the weak, we, now that fighting is gone by, recognize his  duty to work for him.    \"A solution which leaves an unaccounted-for residuum is no solution at  all; and our solution of the problem of human society would have been  none at all had it left the lame, the sick, and the blind outside with  the beasts, to fare as they might. Better far have left the strong and  well unprovided for than these burdened ones, toward whom every heart  must yearn, and for whom ease of mind and body should be provided, if  for no others. Therefore it is, as I told you this morning, that the  title of every man, woman, and child to the means of existence rests on  no basis less plain, broad, and simple than the fact that they are  fellows of one race-members of one human family. The only coin current  is the image of God, and that is good for all we have.    \"I think there is no feature of the civilization of your epoch so  repugnant to modern ideas as the neglect with which you treated your  dependent classes. Even if you had no pity, no feeling of brotherhood,  how was it that you did not see that you were robbing the incapable  class of their plain right in leaving them unprovided for?\"    \"I don't quite follow you there,\" I said. \"I admit the claim of this  class to our pity, but how could they who produced nothing claim a  share of the product as a right?\"    \"How happened it,\" was Dr. Leete's reply, \"that your workers were able  to produce more than so many savages would have done? Was it not wholly  on account of the heritage of the past knowledge and achievements of  the race, the machinery of society, thousands of years in contriving,  found by you ready-made to your hand? How did you come to be possessors  of this knowledge and this machinery, which represent nine parts to one  contributed by yourself in the value of your product? You inherited it,  did you not? And were not these others, these unfortunate and crippled  brothers whom you cast out, joint inheritors, co-heirs with you? What  did you do with their share? Did you not rob them when you put them off  with crusts, who were entitled to sit with the heirs, and did you not  add insult to robbery when you called the crusts charity?    \"Ah, Mr. West,\" Dr. Leete continued, as I did not respond, \"what I do  not understand is, setting aside all considerations either of justice  or brotherly feeling toward the crippled and defective, how the workers  of your day could have had any heart for their work, knowing that their  children, or grand-children, if unfortunate, would be deprived of the  comforts and even necessities of life. It is a mystery how men with  children could favor a system under which they were rewarded beyond  those less endowed with bodily strength or mental power. For, by the  same discrimination by which the father profited, the son, for whom he  would give his life, being perchance weaker than others, might be  reduced to crusts and beggary. How men dared leave children behind  them, I have never been able to understand.\"    Note.--Although in his talk on the previous evening Dr. Leete had  emphasized the pains taken to enable every man to ascertain and follow  his natural bent in choosing an occupation, it was not till I learned  that the worker's income is the same in all occupations that I realized  how absolutely he may be counted on to do so, and thus, by selecting  the harness which sets most lightly on himself, find that in which he  can pull best. The failure of my age in any systematic or effective way  to develop and utilize the natural aptitudes of men for the industries  and intellectual avocations was one of the great wastes, as well as one  of the most common causes of unhappiness in that time. The vast  majority of my contemporaries, though nominally free to do so, never  really chose their occupations at all, but were forced by circumstances  into work for which they were relatively inefficient, because not  naturally fitted for it. The rich, in this respect, had little  advantage over the poor. The latter, indeed, being generally deprived  of education, had no opportunity even to ascertain the natural  aptitudes they might have, and on account of their poverty were unable  to develop them by cultivation even when ascertained. The liberal and  technical professions, except by favorable accident, were shut to them,  to their own great loss and that of the nation. On the other hand, the  well-to-do, although they could command education and opportunity, were  scarcely less hampered by social prejudice, which forbade them to  pursue manual avocations, even when adapted to them, and destined them,  whether fit or unfit, to the professions, thus wasting many an  excellent handicraftsman. Mercenary considerations, tempting men to  pursue money-making occupations for which they were unfit, instead of  less remunerative employments for which they were fit, were responsible  for another vast perversion of talent. All these things now are  changed. Equal education and opportunity must needs bring to light  whatever aptitudes a man has, and neither social prejudices nor  mercenary considerations hamper him in the choice of his life work.
