On our retreat  we travelled round the northern face of the hills, upon whose south  side we had arrived, in hopes of finding some place having water,  where I might form a depot for a few days. By night we could find  none, and had to encamp without, either for ourselves or our horses.    The following day seemed foredoomed to be unlucky; it really appeared  as though everything must go wrong by a natural law. In the first  place, while making a hobble peg, while Carmichael and Robinson were  away after the horses, the little piece of wood slipped out of my  hand, and the sharp blade of the knife went through the top and nail  of my third finger and stuck in the end of my thumb. The cut bled  profusely, and it took me till the horses came to sew my mutilated  digits up. It was late when we left this waterless spot. As there was  a hill with a prepossessing gorge, I left Carmichael and Robinson to  bring the horses on, and rode off to see if I could find water there.  Though I rode and walked in gullies and gorges, no water was to be  found. I then made down to where the horses should have passed along,  and found some of them standing with their packs on, in a small bit of  open ground, surrounded by dense scrubs, which by chance I came to,  and nobody near. I called and waited, and at last Mr. Carmichael came  and told me that when he and Robinson debouched with the horses on  this little open space, they found that two of the animals were  missing, and that Robinson had gone to pick up their tracks. The horse  carrying my papers and instruments was one of the truants. Robinson  soon returned, not having found the track. Neither of them could tell  when they saw the horses last. I sent Mr. Carmichael to another hill  two or three miles away, that we had passed, but not inspected  yesterday, to search for water, while Robinson and I looked for the  missing horses. And lest any more should retreat during our absence,  we tied them up in two mobs. Robinson tied his lot up near a small  rock. We then separately made sweeps round, returning to the horses on  the opposite side, without success. We then went again in company, and  again on opposite sides singly, but neither tracks nor horses could be  found. Five hours had now elapsed since I first heard of their  absence. I determined to make one more circuit beyond any we had  already taken, so as to include the spot we had camped at; this  occupied a couple of hours. When I returned I was surprised to hear  that Robinson had found the horses in a small but extra dense bunch of  scrub not twenty yards from the spot where he had tied his horses up.  While I was away he had gone on top of the little stony eminence close  by, and from its summit had obtained a bird's-eye view of the ground  below, and thus perceived the two animals, which had never been absent  at all. It seemed strange to me that I could not find their tracks,  but the reason was there were no tracks to find. I took it for granted  when Carmichael told me of their absence that they were absent, but he  and Robinson were both mistaken.    It was now nearly evening, and I had been riding my horse at a fast  pace the whole day; I was afraid we could not reach the reserve water  by night. But we pushed on, Mr. Carmichael joining us, not having  found any water. At dusk we reached the small creek or gully, up in  whose rocks I had found the water on Sunday. At a certain point the  creek split in two, or rather two channels joined, and formed one, and  I suppose the same ill fate that had pursued me all day made me  mistake the proper channel, and we drove the unfortunate and limping  horses up a wretched, rocky, vile, scrubby, almost impenetrable gully,  where there was not a sup of water.    On discovering my error, we had to turn them back over the same  horrible places, all rocks, dense scrubs, and triodia, until we got  them into the proper channel. When near the first little hole I had  formerly seen, I dismounted, and walked up to see how it had stood  during my absence, and was grieved to discover that the lowest and  largest hole was nearly dry. I bounded up the rocks to the next, and  there, by the blessing of Providence, was still a sufficient quantity,  as the slow trickling of the water from basin to basin had not yet  entirely ceased, though its current had sadly diminished since my last  visit only some seventy hours since.    By this time it was dark, and totally impossible to get the horses up  the gully. We had to get them over a horrible ridge of broken and  jumbled rocks, having to get levers and roll away huge boulders, to  make something like a track to enable the animals to reach the water.    Time (and labour) accomplishes all things, and in time the last  animal's thirst was quenched, and the last drop of water sucked up  from every basin. I was afraid it would not be replenished by morning.  We had to encamp in the midst of a thicket of a kind of willow acacia  with pink bark all in little curls, with a small and pretty  mimosa-like leaf. This bush is of the most tenacious nature--you may  bend it, but break it won't. We had to cut away sufficient to make an  open square, large enough for our packs, and to enable us to lie down,  also to remove the huge bunches of spinifex that occupied the space;  then, when the stones were cleared away, we had something like a place  for a camp. By this time it was midnight, and we slept, all heartily  tired of our day's work, and the night being cool we could sleep in  comfort. Our first thought in the morning was to see how the basins  looked. Mr. Carmichael went up with a keg to discover, and on his  return reported that they had all been refilled in the night, and that  the trickling continued, but less in volume. This was a great relief  to my mind; I trust the water will remain until I return from those  dismal-looking mountains to the west. I made another search during the  morning for more water, but without success, and I can only conclude  that this water was permitted by Providence to remain here in this  lonely spot for my especial benefit, for no more rain had fallen here  than at any of the other hills in the neighbourhood, nor is this one  any higher or different from the others which I visited, except that  this one had a little water and all the rest none. In gratitude  therefore to this hill I have called it Mount Udor. Mount Udor was the  only spot where water was to be found in this abominable region, and  when I left it the udor had departed also. I got two of my  riding-horses shod to-day, as the country I intended to travel over is  about half stones and half scrub. I have marked a eucalyptus or  gum-tree in this gully close to the foot of the rock where I found the  water [EG/21], as this is my twenty-first camp from Chambers' Pillar.  My position here is in latitude 23 degrees 14', longitude 130 degrees  55', and variation 3 degrees east nearly. I could not start to-day as  the newly shod horses are so tender-footed that they seem to go worse  in their shoes; they may be better to-morrow. The water still holds  out. The camp is in a confined gully, and warm, though it is  comparatively a cool day. The grass here is very poor, and the horses  wander a great deal to look for feed. Four of them could not be found  in the morning. A slight thunderstorm passed over in the night, with a  sprinkling of rain for nearly an hour, but not sufficient fell to damp  a pocket-handkerchief. It was, however, quite sufficient to damp my  hopes of a good fall. The flies are very numerous here and  troublesome. After watering my two horses I started away by myself for  the ranges out west. I went on our old tracks as far as they went,  then I visited some other hills on my line of march. As usual, the  country alternated between open stones at the foot of the hills and  dense scrubs beyond. I thought one of the beds of scrubs I got into  the densest I had ever seen, it was actually impenetrable without  cutting one's way, and I had to turn around and about in all  directions. I had the greatest difficulty to get the horse I was  leading to come on at all; I had no power over him whatever. I could  not use either a whip or a stick, and he dragged so much that he  nearly pulled me out of my saddle, so that I could hardly tell which  way I was going, and it was extremely difficult to keep anything like  a straight course. Night overtook me, and I had to encamp in the  scrubs, having travelled nearly forty miles. A few drops of rain fell;  it may have benefited the horses, but to me it was a nuisance. I was  up, off my sandy couch early enough, but had to wait for daylight  before I could get the horses; they had wandered away for miles back  towards the camp, and I had the same difficulties over again when  getting them back to where the saddles were. In seven or eight miles  after starting I got out of the scrubs. At the foot of the mountain  for which I was steering there was a little creek or gully, with some  eucalypts where I struck it. It was, as all the others had been,  scrubby, rocky, and dry. I left the horses and ascended to the top,  about 900 feet above the scrubs which surrounded it. The horizon was  broken by low ranges nearly all round, but scrubs as usual intervened  between them. I descended and walked into dozens of gullies and rocky  places, and I found some small holes and basins, but all were dry. At  this spot I was eighty miles from a sufficient supply of water; that  at the camp, forty-five miles away, may be gone by the time I return.  Under these circumstances I could not go any farther west. It was now  evening again. I left these desolate hills, the Ehrenberg Ranges of my  map, and travelled upon a different line, hoping to find a better or  less thick route through the scrubs, but it was just the same, and  altogether abominable. Night again overtook me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#18)"],[1,"rks, and Lockhart as they worked on their  reef), and as soon as the horses returned, the little band set forth in  the direction from which the welcome sound had come, and before long saw  the camp of the lucky prospectors.    Fortunately Mr. Parks had some knowledge of surgery, picked up in the  African bush, where he had been a trader, and so could doctor the wounded  men. Here they camped until one morning, Janet, recovered of his hurt,  picked up a nugget of gold, strangely enough, close to the track from  Roger's camp to the reef he was working. This nugget was the first-fruit  of a plentiful harvest, and presently they went down to the coast where  poor Cable could be properly attended to in hospital. Pickering and Janet  returned as soon as possible, but not before some inkling of their find  had leaked out; consequently when they returned, just at the time of our  arrival on the scene, their tracks were followed, and a \"rush\" set in.    We were not long in making our camp at the new diggings, or in getting to  work to hunt for gold. Being out for a syndicate, who naturally wanted  something big in the way of a reef, we were precluded from the alluring  search for alluvial, \"specking,\" as it is termed.    It seems the simplest thing in the world to find a good mine--that is, as  I said before, after you have found it! On Sunday, February 17th, Paddy  and I took a walk, and stepped right on to an outcrop of quartz showing  beautiful gold. Quite simple! Any fool can prospect; all he wants is a  little luck, and the strange inner urgings that make him examine a certain  quartz reef or blow that others have passed, perhaps dozens of times,  without happening to look in the right place! Roughly marking out an area,  to establish our prior claim to the ground amongst those already on the  field, we returned to camp and gave Jim, who had been packing water from  the granites, the joyful news.    On Monday before daylight we were out, and soon had eighteen acres marked  off by a post at each corner, and our notices posted on a conspicuous  tree, which we had been unable to do the day before, Sunday-pegging being  illegal.    Fresh parties were now arriving daily, and the consequent demand for water  made it necessary for Jim to camp at the rocks, and bring us a supply  whenever he was able.    This was not accomplished without some trouble, for not only were the  soaks we had dug with so much labour, made use of by the new-comers,  which we did not object to, but our right to the water was often disputed  by some who, with small regard for the truth, said that it was they who  had sunk the wells! Jim, however, was not the man to be bluffed, and, in  spite of lameness from sciatica in the loins and hip, managed to keep us  well supplied. Short-handed already, we were further handicapped by Paddy  smashing his thumb, and thus, for a time, I was the only sound workman of  the party.          CHATTER VI        ALONE IN THE BUSH      By March 4th we were satisfied that the appearance of the mine was good  enough to warrant our applying for a lease of the area already marked out.  So leaving Czar behind, to enable Paddy and Jim to pack water, I, riding  Satan and leading Misery, loaded with specimens from the reef, set forth  for Coolgardie, to apply for the lease, and get a fresh supply of  provisions, of which we were sadly in need. My departure for Coolgardie  was taken advantage of by several who wished to bank their gold, and thus  I became an escort.    Coolgardie lay almost due south, 220 miles on the chart, but nearly 300  miles by the track, which deviated from water to water. Speed being an  object, I decided to strike through the bush to George Withers' hole.  Here, by the way, poor Alec Kellis had just been murdered by the  blacks--not the pleasantest of news to hear, as I started on my solitary  journey. I followed a horse pad for fifty-five miles, mostly through thick  scrub, to Cutmore's Well, where several parties were camped, who eagerly  questioned me as to the richness of the new field.    Leaving Cutmore's, I struck through the bush, and before long the sickness  I had had on me for some time past, developed into a raging fever. Every  bone in my body ached and shot with pain. I could neither ride nor walk  for more than a few minutes at a stretch; I was unable to eat, nor cared  to drink the hot water in my canteen. I struggled on, now riding, now  walking, and now resting under a bush, travelling in this fashion as long  as daylight lasted, from five in the morning until six at night. Afraid to  let the camels go at night lest they should wander too far, or, while I  was following them in the morning, my packs should be raided by the  blacks, I tied them down, one on either side of my blankets; and thus I  had not only a protection against the wind, but the pleasure of their  companionship--no slight blessing in that solitude.    How lonely I felt, in that vast uninhabited bush! Racked by pain, I tossed  from side to side, until sheer weariness kept me still; so still that the  silence of death seemed to have fallen upon us; there was not a sound in  all that sea of scrub, save the occasional sleepy grunt of one of the  camels, until the quiet night re-echoed with the hoarse call of the  \"Mopoke,\" which seemed to be vainly trying to imitate the cheerful notes  of the cuckoo. How could any note be true in such a spot! or how could a  dry-throated bird he anything but hoarse! At last morning came, heralded  by the restless shuffling of the camels, and another day's journey began.    Tying the camels down at nights necessitated the cutting of scrub and  bushes for them to feed upon, and I doubt they got little enough to eat.  Before long I was too weak to lift the saddles off, and could only with  difficulty load and unload the bags of quartz, and, weakened as I was by  illness, my labours were not light. Yet further trouble was in store for  me, for presently a salt lake barred my way. Then I began to understand  the meaning of the word despair. Neither kindness or cruelty would induce  my camels to cross; I was therefore forced to follow the banks of the  lake, hoping to get round it, as I could see what I supposed was its end.  Here I was again baffled by a narrow channel not ten yards wide. It might  as well have been half a mile, for all the chance I had of crossing it.  The trend of the lake was north-west by south-east, and I was now at the  north-west end, but stopped, as I say, by a narrow channel connecting  evidently with another lake further to the north-west.    There was nothing for it but to retrace my steps, and follow along the  margin of the lake to the south-east, and eventually I got round, having  been forced some ten miles out of my course.    I was fortunate in finding water without difficulty, in a small rock-hole  amongst some granite hills in which \"Granite Creek\" takes its rise.  From these I had still eighty miles to travel before I could reach a  settlement, Coongarrie (the 90 mile) being the nearest point. Could I do  it? I had to succeed or perish miserably, and a man fights hard for his  life. So I struggled on day and night, stopping at frequent intervals from  sheer exhaustion, cursing the pitiless sun, and praying for it to sink  below the horizon. Some twenty miles from Coongarrie I was relieved by  striking a track, which did away with the necessity of thinking where I  was going.    A few miles more, and--joy unspeakable--I found a condenser and a camp.  The hospitable proprietor, whose name I never learned, did all he could to  make me comfortable, and I felt inclined to stay, but despatch was  imperative, for not only must the lease be applied for forthwith, but  Conley and Egan must be provisioned. At Coongarrie I gave a swagman a  lift, and he helped me with the camels and loads, until at last Coolgardie  was reached.    Giving my camels in charge of the first man I could find willing to look  after them, an Afghan, Neel Bas by name, I finished my business at the  Warden's office. Then, yielding to the persuasion of my friends in Asken  and Nicolson's store, I retired to the hospital, for indeed I could fight  against my sickness no longer. Here I remained some three weeks under the  kind care of Miss O'Brien (now Mrs. Castieau) and Miss Millar, the pioneer  nurses on the goldfields. No words can express the admiration I, and all  of us, felt for the pluck and goodness of these two gently nurtured  ladies, who had braved the discomforts and hardships of the road from York  to Coolgardie--discomforts that many of the so-called stronger sex had  found too much for them--to set up their hospital tent, and soothe the  sufferings of poor fever-stricken fellows.    The services of these kind ladies, and of many that subsequently followed  their example, were badly needed, for the typhoid fiend was  rampant--carrying off the young, and apparently strong, men at a rate too  tremendous to be credible. Funerals were too common to call for even  passing notice. \"Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung,\" they went to a nameless  grave.    My chief anxiety was for my mates. How could I send them relief,  incapacitated as I was? Fortunately, my friend David Wilson offered to go  for me, in consideration of a certain interest in the mine we had found.  This was a great help, and now I could rest contented; not altogether  though, for Neel Bas had some hesitation in giving up the camels, and had  a violent row with Dave Wilson, all of which he would insist on explaining  to me in broken English, as he sat cross-legs on the floor of my tent. The  doctor happily arrived and kicked him out, and I was left in peace. In  less than three weeks I was able to go by coach to Southern Cross, and  thence by train to Perth, where, under the kind roof of Colonel Fleming,  the Commandant, I soon regained my health.
