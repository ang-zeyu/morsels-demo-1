The other phaeton was drawn by a tall bony brown horse, that looked as  if he had seen better days, and could boast a little blood.    The Colonel politely invited Mrs. Winter to accompany him, and Kate  most provokingly took her place with Mr. Winter, when some discussion  arose in consequence of Winter's protesting he must take his boy to  look after Cyclops; this left us minus a seat, but I obviated the  difficulty by offering to drive the brown horse, leaving the original  Jehu behind, and sharing the driving seat with Gilpin. Kate rewarded me  with a bright smile as I handed her into Winter's phaeton.    \"A dashing turn-out, Egerton,\" said the Colonel; \"what would your  friend, Colonel Dashwood, say to it?\"    \"That I'm in great luck to be included in so pleasant a party on any  terms. I wish I could persuade you you would be safer on the driving  seat with me, Miss Vernon.\"    She shook her head.    \"Do not let Cyclops go, Tom, till I have got the reins settled,\" said  Winter, who had armed himself with a pair of green goggles to keep off  the dust.    \"Arrah! there, ye'r the awkerdest crather I ever seen,\" exclaimed  Nurse, as the rejected Jehu was endeavouring to arrange a large basket  of provisions in the Colonel's phaeton, \"d'ye want to have the Captin's  knees in his mouth, ye omadhaun, can't ye put it in this away?\"    \"I don't think it will fix, no ways.\"    \"Now then, are we to start or not,\" said Winter. \"Here! put that basket  in my buggy; we are lighter than you. Tom, a piece of cord, give it to  Mrs. O'Toole; you needn't let Cyclops off yet.\"    Cyclops coughed approvingly.    \"A'there! look at me bould Shyclops, cockin' his tail; Miss Kate,  honey, have ye ye'r strong boots on?\"    \"All right, Mr. Winter,\" cried I.    \"Let him go, Tom.\"    \"God speed yez.\"    I held in my steed, who, notwithstanding his low condition, was still  eager; and after a few energetic lashes, which only entangled the whip  in the traces, Winter led the way, as he wished, and after traversing  some very narrow crooked streets and lanes, apparently paved with a  view to dislocate all travellers, we emerged upon a fine broad road,  where I took the liberty of making the brown horse keep neck and neck  with Cyclops. Winter's was certainly a curious turn out, with a huge  basket tied on the back seat, leaving a narrow ledge for Tom to perch  on; Winter himself in a broad brimm'd straw hat, the expression of his  features completely changed (by the total eclipse of his eyes under  green goggles) into one of preternatural gravity and pre-occupation,  sitting bolt upright, and considerably in the middle of the carriage,  leaving small space for Miss Vernon, and terribly embarrassed with the  reins.    Our own was not much better; the cane work doing duty for panels broken  in several places, and the brown horse leaning against the collar, and  pulling with all his might. How Burton would have laughed at the whole  concern; yet never did I enjoy a pic nic so much.    The road leading through a fine rich, though rather flat country, its  chief ornament an abundance of splendid timber, at one place crossed  a marshy common, where, the Organist informed me, the Royalists had  been routed, in the civil wars. Many a sally from Kate, upholding  the superiority of their steed to ours, enlivened our journey, while  Winter's attention was a good deal engrossed by a tendency of the  reins to get under Cyclops' tail.    Our progress was not rapid, but at length we reached our destination.  Mowbray Castle stands close to the modern house of the Earl of----;  they were generally absentees, and kindly permitted the vulgar public  to enjoy the beauties they did not value; a civil gate keeper admitted  us into an unpretending avenue, and shouted a warning after us, that  one side of the ruins was unsafe, but which no one seemed to heed.  Winter said that was a matter of course hint, given to every visitor,  and that he would undertake to guide us.    We entered a quadrangular court yard, bare and blazing with sunshine,  where we left the carriages, and I secured Miss Vernon as my companion,  while Winter gave some directions to Tom, as to the arrangements of  dinner, all agreeing to leave the selection of our banqueting hall to  him.    \"Push open this gate for me, Captain Egerton,\" said Kate, after a vain  attempt to move a pair of heavy wooden doors to the left. I obeyed,  and we stepped at once from the glare of the paved court yard into the  cool shade of grand old trees, feathering to the ground, with gleams  of sunshine breaking through upon the rich soft mossy turf beneath.  A broad straight gravelled walk led up a steep hill before us, under  a perfect arch of luxuriant foliage, the modern house lying a little  distance to the left.    Here we were joined by Winter, who had discarded the green specs, his  hat in one hand and a handkerchief in the other. Reaching the hill,  and emerging from the shade of the trees, we found ourselves upon  the edge of what was formerly the moat of the Castle, now a gravel  walk, with steeply sloping grassy sides, studded with evergreens and  flowering shrubs. Beyond, the ruins rose majestic in their decay, and  crowning the sudden hill we had partially ascended, a narrow stone  arch, allowing of one passenger only at a time, was here thrown over  the moat; the ivy and other creepers hanging from it in graceful  streamers and festoons. It had no parapet or rail. Kate walked over  it fearlessly and at once, but Mrs. Winter hesitated, and accepted my  hand to lead her across. A good deal of climbing ensued up and down  dilapidated spiral staircases, and among yawning chasms, leading to  torture chambers and _oubliettes_ as Miss Vernon suggested. Some of  the views from the elevated position on which we stood, over the rich  flat country with its winding river, and the distant towers of A----  were fine; but I agreed with Kate in preferring the opposite side of  the Castle, where the hill was more precipitous, and you looked down  into a sea of foliage, with an undulating ferny deer park beyond, and  a background of blue mountains in the distance. Winter was already  arranging his drawing materials in front of a round tower, with an  arched door half hidden by a graceful ash tree.    After looking at his preparations, \"I should like a sketch of the  Castle as we first came upon it, a little to the right, to take in that  pretty bridge; what subject are you going to select, Captain Egerton?\"  asked Kate.    \"If you will show me the spot you speak of, I will endeavour to carry  out your idea.\"    \"That is delightful! follow me.\"    I saw in a moment she had selected an admirable point of view, and I  was soon hard at work, Miss Vernon bending over my drawing, offering  suggestions as I proceeded, now leaning back against the _débris_ of an  old tower, cutting my pencils and telling me legends of the Castle; now  wandering away with Gilpin to inspect Winter's sketch, and returning  with a report of his progress to stimulate my energies, while Mrs.  Winter and the Colonel seated themselves on a rustic bench, occupying  an elevated position in what was once the Keep, from which the rival  sketchers were both visible, and the latter producing a newspaper  from his pocket, sometimes holding his glasses to his eyes, sometimes  tapping them on the paper, seemed to read aloud for his companion's  amusement. A couple of hours glided pleasantly away, and Kate was  congratulating me on my faithful delineation of the ruins, when we  perceived Winter join his wife and the Colonel. He waved his straw hat,  and making a speaking trumpet of a roll of paper, shouted \"Dinner!\"  very audibly.    \"In a minute,\" said Miss Vernon, forgetting he could not hear her,  \"just finish that bit of shading, Captain Egerton; Mr. Gilpin and I  will put up all your things.\"    \"Are you coming?\" shouted Winter once more.    I put my portfolio under my arm, shouldered my camp stool, and we  soon joined the impatient and hungry artist, who led the way to a  well-chosen site for dinner. A bastion to the east of the Castle,  commanding a totally different view both north and south, which the  remains of a grey watch tower at one angle served to divide into  two distinct pictures. Close under it our banquet was spread; some  moss-grown stones and our camp stools supplying us with seats; gaily  and laughingly we attacked the viands. Winter presided, eating and  talking with great energy, seated on a high stone, which compelled  him to keep his feet on tiptoe to prevent his well-filled plate from  gliding off his knees; kneeling down every now and then to dive into  the interior of a partridge pie, his own contribution to the feast.    \"I must trouble you again, Winter,\" said the Colonel; \"no paste thank  you, but Teniers himself never gave a better interior.\"    \"I made it myself, Colonel,\" said Mrs. Winter, triumphantly.    \"My dear Madam, fair hands make fair work.\"    \"_Bel parlare poco costa_,\" ejaculated Winter.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself to say such things in an unknown  tongue,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"What was it, my dear?\" enquired his wife; \"indeed, John, those wicked  words are very sinful.\"    \"Ha, ha, Miss Vernon, you are a mischievous little witch! Ah, Sue,  you've an old reprobate of a husband.\"    \"Let us fill a bumper to the memory of those glorious old Normans, who  left us so charming a banqueting hall,\" said I.    \"You do not express yourself properly; let us 'drain a cup' is more  appropriate,\" interrupted Miss Vernon.    \"A set of unmitigated robbers without a spark of humanity,\" said the  Artist.    \"You must admit they were often splendidly generous,\" interposed Miss  Vernon.    \"Ay, by fits and starts.\"    \"As much as could be expected from ignorant uncivilised warriors,\" said  I; \"they were rude and cruel enough, so were all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#18)"],[1,"foodstuffs; great privations were endured; many died;  and, as in every other part of our Empire, the ways of Rhodesia are  strewn with the bones of the men who won the land for their country.    But the men who go out as the pioneers of the Empire are not easily  discouraged. The settlement and development of the country was at once  undertaken with energy. Arrangements were made for the administration of  the new State; a legal system was created; roads were constructed;  mining plant was brought up; mining operations commenced; land was  brought under cultivation; stores were opened; townships were surveyed,  and rose rapidly from the wilderness, handsome brick buildings taking  the place of the huts in which the pioneers roughed it at first. But the  development of the country was much retarded by the difficulty of  communication and the enormous cost of transport. Little could be done  until Rhodesia was afforded railway communication with the coast; so Mr.  Rhodes made arrangements for the extension of the Cape railway from its  then terminus at Kimberley, and for the construction of a line to Beira  on the east coast.    The Chartered Company had not long effected its active occupation of  Mashonaland before the Matabele impis resumed their murderous raids on  the Mashonas, and in 1893 the Matabele war broke out, leading to the  overthrow of Lobengula and the absorption of Matabeleland by the  Chartered Company. Nearly every able-bodied white man in Mashonaland  volunteered his services. Three columns, numbering nine hundred men in  all, marched through the country, defeating the Matabele impis on the  Shangani and Zambesi; Bulawayo was occupied, and with the gallant stand  of Wilson and his little force, the war was brought to a conclusion.    Then the white man's city began to rise from the veldt, hard by the  burnt kraal of Lobengula. Towards the close of the war I travelled in an  ox-waggon with some Boer transport riders from the Marico Valley in the  Transvaal--about thirty miles from Mafeking--to Bulawayo. This beautiful  valley (\"the Granary of the Transvaal\") was the old home of Moselekatse,  Lobengula's father. It was a fat land; there is none so rich for a  hundred leagues around; for tribes of Zulu blood will establish  themselves in none but the best country, and they will trek far to find  it. The rolling land of Marico is as fertile as it is beautiful. It is  as green as Devon, and the pretty farmhouses of the prosperous people  are scattered among rich pastures, great fields of corn, and fruit  orchards. Fifty years ago the Boers and their Baralong allies drove  Moselekatse and his raiding warriors out of Marico, and sent them  trekking north to seek a new home. So northward they travelled,  murdering and cattle-lifting as they went, traversing good country, but  not such as would satisfy the Zulu, until at last, nearly five hundred  miles from Marico, they came to a land even more favoured than that  they had left, and settled down in what is now called Matabeleland. I  followed their route, and could then understand their choice. Fair  indeed to the eye appears the green, well-watered high veldt of  Matabeleland as the traveller from the south opens it out on reaching  the watershed between the Crocodile and the Zambesi rivers. Lieutenant  Maund, who some years before had been sent to spy out Matabeleland, with  justice reported that, \"when compared to the country south of it, it was  as Canaan after the wilderness.\" When I reached the place where  Bulawayo, with its stately buildings, now stands, I found a few hundred  white men occupying a little temporary settlement of native huts and  tattered tents that had sprung up round the newly-constructed fort; the  building of the modern city had not commenced. A little later I was  present at the first auction of township stands. The alternate land lots  bearing even numbers, lining one side of what was to be the chief  street, were sold. They fetched about £50 apiece. A few months  afterwards the alternate stands bearing odd numbers were sold by  auction; they all fetched over £400 apiece, the highest price realised  being £900. Some of the stands, that could have been purchased for £50  each in 1893, are at the present time worth six or seven thousand pounds  apiece, and realise that price when put on the market. I quote these  figures to show that whatever critics at home may think of the future of  Rhodesia, those on the spot have confidence in it. The Matabele War was  scarcely over before the volunteers, having received their mining, farm,  and loot rights, scattered over the country to prospect and peg out  their claims. It was wonderful to observe how quickly, under Dr.  Jameson's able administration, everything was put in order, and  Matabeleland began to assume the aspect of a settled country. Bulawayo  was soon a fine city, having its water-works, electric lighting,  hospitals, public schools, its imposing court-house and other handsome  public buildings. Townships sprang up like mushrooms all over the high  veldt in the vicinity of the gold-bearing reefs. The population rapidly  increased. The Chartered Company, in the meanwhile, pushed on the  railway from Mafeking towards Bulawayo, proceeded to construct the line  from Umtali to Beira, and quickly placed Bulawayo into telegraphic  communication with the outer world. And now there was every sign of  prosperity; the development of the gold mines gave encouraging results;  trade was good; the value of the land for farming was proved, and  excellent crops were raised; Rhodesia's future seemed assured. But it  was fated that its progress should be retarded by an extraordinary  succession of disasters; surely no new country was ever so sorely  tried.    All was going well until the early part of 1896, when the first of its  many scourges swept down on the unhappy land--the dreaded rinderpest  came from the North, and despite every precaution that could be taken to  prevent its spreading, it destroyed over 90 per cent. of the cattle in  the country, and played like havoc among the wild game. It is difficult  for one who was not in Rhodesia at the time to realise the magnitude of  this misfortune. As this was a land then entirely dependent upon oxen  for transport, a stoppage was put to agricultural and mining operations;  and the cattle-owning native population suffered greatly. Before the  rinderpest broke out the average price of an ox in Rhodesia was £6, and  now, though it is over five years since the rinderpest was stamped out,  the price is about £28. Transport rates rose from 10s. to £5 per 100  lbs., and all the necessaries of life went up to famine prices. These  figures, which will be found in an interesting pamphlet written by Mr.  P. S. Inskip of the British South Africa Company's service, will convey  some idea of the situation. Absolute ruin faced the settlers; it is  wonderful that the bulk of them did not abandon the country in despair,  but pioneers are not easily disheartened, and they stubbornly struggled  on, taking every possible measure to mitigate the effect of the plague.    [Illustration: RHODESIAN NATIVES WASHING CLOTHES]    But misfortune followed on misfortune. The rinderpest was raging when  the Matabele rose, and the Rhodesians had to suppress a formidable  rebellion, which was rendered the more difficult to cope with by the  scarcity of oxen. The white settlers were massacred in outlying  districts; there were heroic rescues, the rising spread to Mashonaland,  and it was not until 1897 that the rebellion was crushed and peace for a  little while came to the troubled land. Our total casualties were 690;  and of the white settlers in the country alone 390 were killed and 150  were wounded, that is, 10 per cent. of the population. The Company spent  £360,000 in compensating the settlers for the losses the rebellion had  brought upon them.    It had fortunately been discovered that the rinderpest could be stamped  out by inoculation, but no sooner had this plague been conquered by  science than a terrible outbreak of red-water decimated the remaining  cattle. Locusts, too, came in unwonted numbers to devour the crops, and  horse sickness was very destructive. Then, on the top of all Rhodesia's  troubles, came the but just concluded Boer war cutting off this inland  territory from its communications with its commercial and military bases  on the coast, retarding its development, and once more calling on its  manhood to abandon industry and take up arms for their country. The  Rhodesians responded well to the call; twelve and a half per cent. of  the population fought in the war, and it will be in the memory of all  how well they acquitted themselves in the defence of Bechuanaland and  the relief of Mafeking. Thanks to the foresight of Cecil Rhodes,  Matabeleland was ours. Had it not been so, the Boers when defeated in  war would have trekked north into the rough country--through which it  would have been almost impossible for us to follow them--there to form  new independent states, to intrigue against us as before. It would have  been the old story over again; and after a few years we should have been  plunged into another Boer war. But Rhodes had hemmed in the two Boer  Republics. The quarrel had to be fought out within their boundaries.  There was no outlet for them into the wilderness this time.    [Illustration: THE OUTLET BELOW VICTORIA FALLS, ZAMBESI RIVER.    After Photo by G. W. Wilson, Aberdeen.]    Notwithstanding these successive disasters the Chartered Company and the  settlers had done much during those few troublous years to develop the  country. The rinderpest and the native rebellion made it all the more  urgent to complete the railway system that was to open communication  with the coast. The Company hurried on the construction. In November  1897 the line had been extended from Mafeking to Bulawayo, and in 1899  the line from"]]]
