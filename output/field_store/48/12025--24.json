An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#18)"],[1,"cies; to suppose original equality in human  society is to admit by implication that the present inequality is  a degeneration from the nature of this society,--a thing which the  defenders of property cannot explain. But I infer therefrom that, if  Providence placed the first human beings in a condition of equality, it  was an indication of its desires, a model that it wished them to realize  in other forms; just as the religious sentiment, which it planted in  their hearts, has developed and manifested itself in various ways. Man  has but one nature, constant and unalterable: he pursues it through  instinct, he wanders from it through reflection, he returns to it  through judgment; who shall say that we are not returning now? According  to Grotius, man has abandoned equality; according to me, he will yet  return to it. How came he to abandon it? Why will he return to it? These  are questions for future consideration.    Reid writes as follows:--    \"The right of property is not innate, but acquired. It is not grounded  upon the constitution of man, but upon his actions. Writers on  jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy  every man of common understanding.    \"The earth is given to men in common for the purposes of life, by the  bounty of Heaven. But to divide it, and appropriate one part of its  produce to one, another part to another, must be the work of men  who have power and understanding given them, by which every man may  accommodate himself, WITHOUT HURT TO ANY OTHER.    \"This common right of every man to what the earth produces, before it  be occupied and appropriated by others, was, by ancient moralists, very  properly compared to the right which every citizen had to the public  theatre, where every man that came might occupy an empty seat, and  thereby acquire a right to it while the entertainment lasted; but no man  had a right to dispossess another.    \"The earth is a great theatre, furnished by the Almighty, with perfect  wisdom and goodness, for the entertainment and employment of all  mankind. Here every man has a right to accommodate himself as a  spectator, and to perform his part as an actor; but without hurt to  others.\"      Consequences of Reid's doctrine.    1. That the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no one, it  must be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be  shared, divided by the number of those who are to share it;    2. The number of places being of necessity equal at all times to that  of the spectators, no spectator can occupy two places, nor can any actor  play several parts;    3. Whenever a spectator comes in or goes out, the places of all contract  or enlarge correspondingly: for, says Reid, \"THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY  IS NOT INNATE, BUT ACQUIRED;\" consequently, it is not absolute;  consequently, the occupancy on which it is based, being a conditional  fact, cannot endow this right with a stability which it does not possess  itself. This seems to have been the thought of the Edinburgh professor  when he added:--      \"A right to life implies a right to the necessary means of life; and  that justice, which forbids the taking away the life of an innocent man,  forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means of life. He has  the same right to defend the one as the other. To hinder another man's  innocent labor, or to deprive him of the fruit of it, is an injustice  of the same kind, and has the same effect as to put him in fetters or in  prison, and is equally a just object of resentment.\"      Thus the chief of the Scotch school, without considering at all the  inequality of skill or labor, posits a priori the equality of the means  of labor, abandoning thereafter to each laborer the care of his own  person, after the eternal axiom: WHOSO DOES WELL, SHALL FARE WELL.    The philosopher Reid is lacking, not in knowledge of the principle, but  in courage to pursue it to its ultimate. If the right of life is equal,  the right of labor is equal, and so is the right of occupancy. Would  it not be criminal, were some islanders to repulse, in the name of  property, the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach  the shore? The very idea of such cruelty sickens the imagination. The  proprietor, like Robinson Crusoe on his island, wards off with pike and  musket the proletaire washed overboard by the wave of civilization, and  seeking to gain a foothold upon the rocks of property. \"Give me work!\"  cries he with all his might to the proprietor: \"don't drive me away, I  will work for you at any price.\" \"I do not need your services,\" replies  the proprietor, showing the end of his pike or the barrel of his gun.  \"Lower my rent at least.\" \"I need my income to live upon.\" \"How can  I pay you, when I can get no work?\" \"That is your business.\" Then the  unfortunate proletaire abandons himself to the waves; or, if he attempts  to land upon the shore of property, the proprietor takes aim, and kills  him.    We have just listened to a spiritualist; we will now question a  materialist, then an eclectic: and having completed the circle of  philosophy, we will turn next to law.    According to Destutt de Tracy, property is a necessity of our nature.  That this necessity involves unpleasant consequences, it would be  folly to deny. But these consequences are necessary evils which do not  invalidate the principle; so that it is as unreasonable to rebel against  property on account of the abuses which it generates, as to complain  of life because it is sure to end in death. This brutal and pitiless  philosophy promises at least frank and close reasoning. Let us see if it  keeps its promise.      \"We talk very gravely about the conditions of property,... as if it was  our province to decide what constitutes property.... It would seem, to  hear certain philosophers and legislators, that at a certain moment,  spontaneously and without cause, people began to use the words THINE and  MINE; and that they might have, or ought to have, dispensed with them.  But THINE and MINE were never invented.\"      A philosopher yourself, you are too realistic. THINE and MINE do not  necessarily refer to self, as they do when I say your philosophy, and my  equality; for your philosophy is you philosophizing, and my equality is  I professing equality. THINE and MINE oftener indicate a relation,--YOUR  country, YOUR parish, YOUR tailor, YOUR milkmaid; MY chamber, MY seat at  the theatre, MY company and MY battalion in the National Guard. In the  former sense, we may sometimes say MY labor, MY skill, MY virtue; never  MY grandeur nor MY majesty: in the latter sense only, MY field, MY  house, MY vineyard, MY capital,--precisely as the banker's clerk says  MY cash-box. In short, THINE and MINE are signs and expressions of  personal, but equal, rights; applied to things outside of us, they  indicate possession, function, use, not property.    It does not seem possible, but, nevertheless, I shall prove, by  quotations, that the whole theory of our author is based upon this  paltry equivocation.      \"Prior to all covenants, men are, not exactly, as Hobbes says, in a  state of HOSTILITY, but of ESTRANGEMENT. In this state, justice and  injustice are unknown; the rights of one bear no relation to the rights  of another. All have as many rights as needs, and all feel it their duty  to satisfy those needs by any means at their command.\"      Grant it; whether true or false, it matters not. Destutt de Tracy cannot  escape equality. On this theory, men, while in a state of ESTRANGEMENT,  are under no obligations to each other; they all have the right  to satisfy their needs without regard to the needs of others, and  consequently the right to exercise their power over Nature, each  according to his strength and ability. That involves the greatest  inequality of wealth. Inequality of conditions, then, is the  characteristic feature of estrangement or barbarism: the exact opposite  of Rousseau's idea.    But let us look farther:--      \"Restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the time when  covenants, either implied or expressed, are agreed upon. Then appears  for the first time justice and injustice; that is, the balance between  the rights of one and the rights of another, which up to that time were  necessarily equal.\"    Listen: RIGHTS WERE EQUAL; that means that each individual had the right  to SATISFY HIS NEEDS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE NEEDS OF OTHERS. In other  words, that all had the right to injure each other; that there was no  right save force and cunning. They injured each other, not only by war  and pillage, but also by usurpation and appropriation. Now, in order to  abolish this equal right to use force and stratagem,--this equal  right to do evil, the sole source of the inequality of benefits and  injuries,--they commenced to make COVENANTS EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED,  and established a balance. Then these agreements and this balance  were intended to secure to all equal comfort; then, by the law of  contradictions, if isolation is the principle of inequality, society  must produce equality. The social balance is the equalization of the  strong and the weak; for, while they are not equals, they are strangers;  they can form no associations,--they live as enemies. Then, if  inequality of conditions is a necessary evil, so is isolation, for  society and inequality are incompatible with each other. Then, if  society is the true condition of man's existence, so is equality also.  This conclusion cannot be avoided.    This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this  balance, inequality has been on the increase? How is it that justice and  isolation always accompany each other? Destutt de Tracy shall reply:--      \"NEEDS and MEANS, RIGHTS and DUTIES, are products of the will. If man  willed nothing, these would not exist. But to have needs and means,  rights and duties, is to HAVE, to POSSESS, something.

The memories  bring smiles to his wrinkled, black face.    \"Honey, dar was a dance every Sattidy night,\" he chuckled, \"an' all de  niggers nigh 'bout broke dey legs adancin'.\"    \"And didn't you dance just as hard as the others, Uncle George?\"    \"Well, Mistus, I was right spry; but I was at my best in de job of  pickin' de banjer. I shorely did love to pick dat box while de other  niggers danced away.\"    George said his family came from Virginia to Mississippi, and that he  came to Greene County about 60 years ago. His two masters were a Mr.  Dillard and Bob Steele.    George explained that he was a field hand and had to work hard most of  the time.    \"But us had plenty to eat,\" he said. \"De food was cooked in Ol' Mistus'  kitchen an' sont to de fiel' on a big cart. I 'member dat a bell would  ring for us to git up, an' we would work as long as it was daylight.\"    George said that Mr. Steele owned about 200 slaves and that he always  had plenty of everything. The plantation, he said, consisted of about  2,000 acres.    \"Ol' Massa had a church right on de plantation for us niggers,\" he  continued. \"Many's de time I danced late in de night an' den had to git  up an' go to church wid de rest. All of us had to go. A white man would  preach, but I allus enjoyed de singin' most of all.\"    George believes earnestly that ghosts exist, but admits they have never  bothered him.

No'm, I's  not 'fraid of 'em; but I knows plenty of niggers dat'll run if a ghost  so much as brushes by 'em.\"    The old darkey said that \"atter freedom come to de worl'\" he continued  to live with his master and worked a share crop. He said that Mr. Steele  was always fair and good to him; always giving him the best of  everything.

Her mother's name  was Mary Norris, owned by Mrs. Calvin Norris, who lived in Selma, Ala.,  but had a homestead in Mobile. Her father belonged to people by the name  of Childress, and his name was Green Childress. She doesn't remember  much about him because his white people took him to Texas.    Ella said that her mother was her madame's hairdresser, and that Mrs.  Norris had her mother taught in Mobile. So Ella's life was very easy, as  she stayed around the big house with her mother, although her  grandmother, Penny Anne Norris, cared for her more than her mother did.  One of the things she remembers quite distinctly was her grandmother's  cooking on the fireplace, and how she would not allow any one to spit in  the fireplace. She said her grandmother made corn-pone and wrapped it in  shucks and baked it in ashes.    Ella said she did not know many colored people, since the quarters were "]]]
