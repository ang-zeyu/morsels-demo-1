[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#18)"],[1," Still, she was not ill enough to lose interest in all that was going  on, and used to insist upon the others telling her everything that  happened outside--who made the biggest score at cricket, what flowers  were out in her own straggling patch of garden, how many eggs the  fowls laid a day, how the guinea-pigs and canaries were progressing,  and what was the very latest thing in clothes or boots the new  retriever puppy had devoured.    And Bunty used to bring in the white mice and the blind French  guinea-pig, and let them run loose over the counterpane, and Pip did  most of his carpentering on a little table near, so she could see  each fresh stage and suggest improvements as he went along.    Meg, who had almost severed her connection with Aldith, devoted  herself to her sister, and waited on her hand and foot; she made her  all kinds of little presents--a boot-bag, with compartments; a  brush-and-comb bag, with the monogram \"J.W.,\" worked in pink silk;  a little work-basket, with needle-book, pin-cushion, and all complete.  Judy feared she should be compelled to betake herself to tidy habits  on her recovery.    Her pleasure in the little gifts started a spirit of competition  among the others.    For one whole day Pip was invisible, but in the evening he turned up,  and walked to the bedside with a proud face.  He had constructed a  little set of drawers, three of which actually opened under skilful  coaxing.    \"It's not for doll-clothes,\" he said, after she had exhausted all the  expressions of gratitude in common use, \"because I know you hate  them, but you can keep all your little things in them, you see--hair  strings, and thimbles, and things.\"    There was a sound of dragging outside the door and presently Bunty  came in backward, lugging a great, strange thing.    It seemed to be five or six heavy pieces of board nailed together  haphazard.    \"It's a chair,\" he explained, wiping the perspiration from his  forehead.  \"Oh!  I'm going to put some canvas across it, of course,  so you won't fall through; but I thought I'd show it you first.\"    Judy's eyes smiled, but she thanked him warmly.  \"I wasn't goin'  to make any stupid thing, like Pip did,\" the small youth continued,  looking deprecatingly at the little drawers.  \"This is really  useful, you see; when you get up you can sit on it, Judy, by the  fire and read or sew or something.  You like it better 'n Pip's, don't  you?\"    Judy temporized skilfully, and averted offence to either by asking  them to put the presents with all the others near the head of the bed.    \"What a lot of things you'll have to take back to school, Ju,\" Nell  said, as she added her contribution in the shape of a pair of crochet  cuffs and a doll's wool jacket.    But Judy only flashed her a reproachful glance, and turned her face  to the wall for the rest of the evening.    That was what had been hanging over her so heavily all this long  fortnight in bed--the thought of school in the future.    \"What's going to happen to me when I get better, Esther?\" she  asked next morning, in a depressed way, when her stepmother came to  see her.  \"Is he saving up a lot of beatings for me?  And shall I  have to go back the first week?\"    Esther reassured her.    \"You won't go back this quarter at all, very likely not next either,  Judy dear.  He says you shall go away with some of the others for  a change till you get strong; and, between you and me, I think  its very unlikely you, will go back ever again.\"    With this dread removed, Judy mended more rapidly, surprising even  the doctor with her powers of recuperation.    In three weeks she was about the house again, thin and great-eyed,  but full of nonsense and even mischief once more.  The doctor's visits  ceased; he said she had made a good recovery so far, but should  have change of surroundings, and be taken a long way from sea air.    \"Let her run wild for some months, Woolcot,\" he said at his last  visit; \"it will take time to quite shake off all this and get her  strength and flesh back again.\"    \"Certainly, certainly; she shall go at once,\" the Captain said.    He could not forget the shock he had received in the old loft five  or six weeks ago, and would have agreed if he had been bidden to take  her for a sojourn in the Sahara.    The doctor had told him the mischief done to her lungs was serious.    \"I won't say she will ultimately die of consumption,\"  he had said,  \"but there is always a danger of that vile disease in these nasty  cases.  And little Miss Judy is such a wild, unquiet subject;  she seems to be always in a perfect fever of living, and to possess  a capacity for joy and unhappiness quite unknown to slower natures.  Take care of her, Woolcot, and she'll make a fine woman some day--ay,  a grand woman.\"    The Captain smoked four big cigars in the solitude of his study  before he could decide how he could best \"take care of her.\"    At first he thought he would send her with Meg and the governess to  the mountains for a time, but then there was the difficulty about  lessons for the other three.  He might send them to school, or  engage a governess certainly, but then again there was expense to be  considered.    It was out of the question for the girls to go alone, for Meg had  shown herself nothing but a silly little goose, in spite of her  sixteen years; and Judy needed attention.  Then he remembered  Esther, too, was, looking unwell; the nursing and the General  together had been too much for her, and she looked quite a shadow of  her bright self.  He knew he really ought to send her, too, and the  child, of course.    And again the expense.    He remembered the Christmas holidays were not very far away; what  would become of the house with Pip and Bunty and the two youngest  girls running wild, and no one in authority?  He sighed heavily, and  knocked the ash from his fourth cigar upon the carpet.    Then the postman came along the drive and past the window.  He poked  up with a broad smile, and touched his helmet in a pleased kind of  way.  If almost seemed as if he knew that in one of the letters he  held the solution of the problem that was making the Captain's brow  all criss-crossed with frowning lines.    A fifth cigar was being extracted from the case, a wrinkle was  deepening just over the left eyebrow, a twinge of something very like  gout was calling forth a word or two of \"foreign language,\" when  Esther came in with a smile on her lips and an open letter in her  hands.    \"From Mother,\" she said.  \"Yarrahappini's a wilderness, it seems, and  she wants me to go up, and take the General with me, for a few weeks.\"    \"Ah!\" he said.    It would certainly solve one of the difficulties.  The place was very  far away certainly, but then it was Esther's old home, and she had  not seen it since her marriage.  She would grow strong again there  very quickly.    \"Oh, and Judy, too.\"    \"Ah-h-h!\" he said.    Two of the lines smoothed themselves carefully from his brow.    \"And Meg, because I mentioned she was looking pale.\"    The Captain placed the cigar back in the case.  He forgot there was  such a thing as gout.    \"The invitation could not have been more opportune,\" he said.  \"Accept  by all means; nothing could have been better;  and it is an exceedingly  healthy climate.  The other children can--\"    \"Oh, Father expressly stipulates for Pip as well, because he is a  scamp.\"    \"Upon my word, Esther, your parents have a large enough fund of  philanthropy.  Anyone else included in the invitation?\"    \"Only Nell and Bunty and Baby.  Oh, and Mother says if you can  run up at any time for a few days shooting you know without her  telling you how pleased she will be to see you.\"    \"The hospitality of squatters is world-famed, but this breaks all  previous records, Esther.\"  The Captain got up and stretched himself  with the air of a man released from a nightmare.  \"Accept by all  means--every one of you.  On their own heads be the results;  but  I'm afraid Yarrahappini will be a sadder and wiser place before  the month is over.\"    But just how much sadder or how much wiser he never dreamed.          CHAPTER XV    Three Hundred Miles in the Train      They filled a whole compartment--at least there was one seat vacant,  but people seemed shy of taking it after a rapid survey of them all.    The whole seven of them, and only Esther as bodyguard--Esther--in  a pink blouse an sailor hat, with a face as bright and mischievous  as Pip's own.    The Captain had come to see them off, with Pat to look after the  luggage.  He had bought the tickets--two whole ones for Esther and  Meg, and four halves for the others.  Baby was not provided with even  a half, much to her private indignation--it was an insult to her four  years and a half, she considered, to go free like the General.    But the cost of those scraps of pasteboard had made the Captain look  unhappy: he only received eighteenpence change out of the ten pounds  he had tendered; for Yarrahappini was on the borders of the Never-Never  Land.    He spent the eighteenpence on illustrated papers--Scraps, Ally  Sloper's Half-Holiday, Comic Cuts, Funny Folks, and the like,  evidently having no very exalted opinion of the literary tastes  of his family; and he provided Esther with a yellow-back--on  which was depicted a lady in a green dress fainting in the arms  of a gentleman attired in purple, and Meg with Mark Twain's \"Jumping  Frog\", because he had noticed a certain air of melancholy in her eyes  lately.    Then bells clanged and a whistle shrieked, porters flew wildly about,  and farewells were said, sadly or gaily as the case might be.    There was a woman crying: in a hopeless little way on the platform,  and a girl with sorrowful, loving eyes leaning out of a second-class  window towards her; there was a brown-faced squatter, in a tweed cap  and slippers, to whom the three-hundred-mile journey was little more  of an event than dining;  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#18)"],[1,"obtain the opinion of the _learned_ about the meaning of the paper      which he brought with him, and which had been given him as a part      of the contents of the book, although no translation had at that      time been made by the young man with spectacles. On hearing this      odd story, I changed my opinion about the paper, and instead of      viewing it any longer as a hoax, I began to regard it as part of      a scheme to cheat the farmer of his money, and I communicated my      suspicions to him to beware of rogues. He requested an opinion from      me in writing, which, of course, I declined to give, and he then      took his leave, taking his paper with him. This paper in question      was, in fact, a singular scroll. It consisted of all kinds of      singular characters disposed in columns, and had evidently been      prepared by some person who had before him at the time a book      containing various alphabets, Greek and Hebrew letters, crosses and      flourishes; Roman letters inverted or placed sideways were arranged      and placed in perpendicular columns, and the whole ended in a rude      delineation of a circle, divided into various compartments, arched      with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the Mexican      calendar by Humboldt, but copied in such a way as not to betray      the source whence it was derived. I am thus particular as to the      contents of the paper, inasmuch as I have frequently conversed      with friends on the subject since the Mormon excitement began, and      well remember that the paper contained anything else but Egyptian      hieroglyphics. Some time after, the farmer paid me a second visit.      He brought with him the gold book in print, and offered it to      me for sale. I declined purchasing. He then asked permission to      leave the book with me for examination. I declined receiving it,      although his manner was strangely urgent. I adverted once more to      the roguery which, in my opinion, had been practiced upon him,      and asked him what had become of the gold plates. He informed me      they were in a trunk with the spectacles. I advised him to go to a      magistrate and have the trunk examined. He said the curse of God      would come upon him if he did. On my pressing him, however, to go      to a magistrate, he told me he would open the trunk if I would take      the curse of God upon myself. I replied that I would do so with the      greatest willingness, and would incur every risk of that nature,      provided I could only extricate him from the grasp of the rogues.      He then left me. I have given you a full statement of all that I      know respecting the origin of Mormonism and must beg of you as a      personal favor, to publish this letter immediately, should you find      my name mentioned again by these wretched fanatics.        Yours respectfully,        CHAS. ANTHON.    In addition to this acknowledgement of the visit of Martin Harris to  him with the transcript of the Nephite characters, Professor Anthon  subsequently made another acknowledgement of Martin Harris' visit in  a letter written to Rev. T. W. Coit, in answer to a note of inquiry  from that gentleman concerning the professor's connection with the  Book of Mormon. The letter was published in _The Church Record_, vol.  I, no. 22; and is frequently quoted, in parts, at least, in various  anti--\"Mormon\" works. _The Church Record_ was published in New York, I  think; but not having access to that volume I am under the necessity  of copying the parts of Anthon's second letter from anti--\"Mormon\"  books. None of these anti--\"Mormon\" works publish the letter in full,  and doubtless for the reason that in this second letter Mr. Anthon  contradicts several statements that he makes in his letter to E. D.  Howe. Following is his letter to Rev. Coit:        New York, April 3, 1841.        _Rev. and Dear Sir_: I have often heard that the \"Mormons\" claimed      me for an auxiliary, but as no one until the present time has      even requested from me a statement in writing, I have not deemed      it worth while to say anything publicly on the subject. What I do      know of the sect relates to some of the early movements; and as the      facts may amuse you, while they will furnish a satisfactory answer      to the charge of my being a \"Mormon\" proselyte, I proceed to lay      them before you in detail.        Many years ago,--the precise date I do not now recollect,--a      plain-looking countryman called upon me with a letter from Dr.      Samuel L. Mitchell, requesting me to examine, and give my opinion      upon a certain paper, marked with various characters, which the      doctor confessed he could not decipher, and which the bearer of the      note was very anxious to have explained. A very brief examination      of the paper, convinced me that it was a mere hoax, and a very      clumsy one too. The characters were arranged in columns, like the      Chinese mode of writing, and presented the most singular medley      that I ever beheld. Greek, Hebrew and all sorts of letters, more      or less distorted, either through unskilfulness or from actual      design, were intermingled with sundry delineations of half      moons, stars, and other natural objects, and the whole ended in      a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac. The conclusion was      irresistible, that some cunning fellow had prepared the paper      in question for the purpose of imposing upon the countryman who      brought it, and I told the man so without any hesitation. He      then proceeded to give me the history of the whole affair, which      convinced me that he had fallen into the hands of some sharper,      while it left me in great astonishment at his simplicity. On my      telling the bearer of the paper that an attempt had been made to      impose on him and defraud him of his property, he requested me      to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had      shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man's      sake, and partly to let the individual \"behind the curtain\" see      that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as      far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the      paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical      characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected      with them. The countryman then took his leave, with many thanks,      and with the express declaration that he would in no shape part      with his farm, or embark in the speculation of printing the golden      book. [7]        The matter rested here for a considerable time, until one day, when      I had ceased entirely to think of the countryman and his paper, he      paid me a second visit. He now brought with him a duodecimo volume,      which he said was a translation into English of the \"Golden Bible.\"      He also stated, that notwithstanding his original determination,      he had been induced evidently to sell his farm, and apply the      money to the publication of the book, and received the golden      plates as a security for payment. He begged my acceptance of the      volume, assuring me that it would be found extremely interesting,      and that it was already \"making great noise\" in the upper part of      the state. Suspecting now, that some serious trick was on foot,      and that my plain-looking visitor might be in fact a very cunning      fellow, I declined his present, and merely contended myself with      a slight examination of the volume while he stood by. The more I      declined receiving it, however, the more urgent the man became in      offering the book, until at last I told him plainly that if he left      the volume, as he said he intended to do, I should most assuredly      throw it after him as he departed. I then asked him how he could      be so foolish as to sell his farm and engage in this affair; and      requested him to tell me if the plates were really of gold. In      answer to this latter inquiry, he said, that he had not seen the      plates himself, which were carefully locked up in a trunk, but that      he had the trunk in his possession. I advised him by all means      to open the trunk and examine its contents, and if the plates      proved to be of gold, which I did not believe at all, to sell them      immediately. His reply was, that if he opened the trunk, the \"curse      of Heaven would descend upon him and his children. However,\" added      he, \"I will agree to open it, provided you take the 'curse of      Heaven' upon yourself, for having advised me to the step.\" I told      him I was perfectly willing to do so, and begged him to hasten home      and examine the trunk, for he would find that he had been cheated.      He promised to do as I recommended, and left me, taking his book      with him. I have never seen him since.        Such is a plain statement of all I know respecting the \"Mormons.\"      My impression now is, that the plain-looking countryman was none      other than the Prophet Smith himself, who assumed an appearance      of great simplicity in order to entrap me, if possible, into some      recommendation of his book. That the Prophet aided me, by his      inspiration, in interpreting the volume, is only one of the many      amusing falsehoods which the \"Mormonites\" utter, relative to my      participation in their doctrines. Of these doctrines I know nothing      whatever, nor have I ever heard a single discourse from any of      their preachers, although I have often felt a strong curiosity to      become an auditor, since my friends tell me that they frequently      name me in their sermons, and even go so far as to say that I am      alluded to in the prophecies of scripture!        If what I have here written shall prove of any service in opening      the eyes of some of their deluded followers to the real designs "]]]
