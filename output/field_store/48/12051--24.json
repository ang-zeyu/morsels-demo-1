But I have good news for you,  Mademoiselle Marie. After going first to the house and finding it in  the possession of a hideous mob, who were plundering and drinking,  I went to see what had taken place at the hotel of the Duc de  Gisons.  I found that he had, like your father, been arrested in  the night. I learned that the count was absent, and that a party  were inside in readiness to arrest him on his return. Thinking  it probable that he might have gone down to their estate near  Fontainebleau, I went out beyond the gate on that road and waited  for him. I had the good fortune to meet him, to warn him of his  danger, and to prevent his returning to town. He rode away with a  suit of workman's clothes I had procured for him, and was to enter  Paris in that disguise in the evening. He is to call on me at ten  o'clock, and I will then conduct him hither. I thought it best to  come in before to let you know that he was coming.\"    Marie burst into tears of happiness at hearing that her lover had  escaped from the danger which threatened. Worn out by the fatigue  and anxiety of the previous night, she had slept for some hours  after reaching the shelter of the old nurse's roof, but she had  lain awake all night thinking over the danger of all those dear to  her.  She was now completely overcome with the revulsion of feeling.    \"You are a dear boy, Harry!\" Jeanne said with frank admiration,  while Marie sobbed out exclamations of gratitude. \"You do seem to  think about everything; and now Marie knows that Victor is safe, I  do hope she is going to be more like herself. As I tell her, they  cannot hurt father or mother. They have done no wrong, and they  must let them out of prison after a time. Mamma said we were to  be brave; and at anyrate I try to be, and so does Virginie, though  she does cry sometimes. And now I hope Marie will be cheerful too,  and not go about the rooms looking so downcast and wretched. It  seems to me a miserable thing being in love. I should have thought  Marie would have been the last person to be downcast, for no one  is prouder of being a St. Caux than she is.\"    \"I shall be better now, Jeanne,\" Marie said smiling, as she wiped  away her tears. \"You shall not have any reason to complain of me  in future.    \"But do you not think, Harry,\" she went on with a return of her  anxiety, \"that it is very dangerous for Victor to come back into  Paris? I know that his father has long been praying him to make  for the frontier.\"    \"I do not think it is very dangerous at present, mademoiselle,  although it may be later, if this rage against the aristocrats  increases; but I hope that when he has once seen you, which is  his principal object in returning to Paris, he will carry our his  father's wishes and make for the frontier, for his presence here  can be of no possible utility.\"    \"Oh, I hope so,\" Marie said, \"for I am sure Victor would soon  be found out, he could never make himself look like one of these  canaille.\"    \"Why shouldn't he?\" Jeanne said indignantly. \"Harry does, and he  is just as good-looking as Victor.\"    Marie burst into a fit of laughter.    \"What a champion you are, child, to be sure! But you are quite  right. Clothes, after all, do go a long way towards making a man.  Still, although I think that it is dangerous for Harry, I think it  will be more dangerous for Victor; because, you see, he is a man  and he has the manner of his race, and would find it more difficult  to pass himself off as a workman than Harry, who has got something  of English\"--and she hesitated.    \"Roughness,\" Harry put in laughing. \"You are quite right, mademoiselle.  I can assure you that with these thick shoes on I find it quite  natural for me to slouch along as the workmen do; and it will be  much more difficult for the count, who always walks with his head  thrown back, and a sort of air of looking down upon mankind in  general.\"    Marie laughed this time.    \"That is a fair retort. Victor certainly has the grand manner.  However, I shall order him to go; and if he won't obey his father's  wishes, he will have to give way to mine.\"    \"I think, mademoiselle, that it would be wiser for Monsieur de Gisons  to meet you elsewhere than here. The arrival of three relations to  stop with Madame Moulin is sure to attract some little attention  among her neighbours just at first. You will be the subject of talk  and gossip. My visit will no doubt be noticed, and it will be as  well that there should not be more material for talk. The less we  attract attention the better. No doubt many have escaped arrest,  and there will be a sharp look-out, for, as they will call us,  suspicious persons. I should propose, if you have no objection to  such a course, that you should stroll out with your sisters and  Louise through the fields to St.  Denis. The count will be in my  room in a few minutes. We can keep a look-out from my window and  follow you at a distance until we get clear from observation beyond  the gates.\"    Marie looked at Madame Moulin, who nodded.    \"That would be the best plan, my dear.  What Monsieur Sandwith  says is very true. The less we give the neighbours to gossip about  the better; for though your disguises are good, if sharp eyes are  watching you they may note something in your walk or air that may  excite suspicion.\"    \"That being arranged then you must excuse me, for it is just the  time when the count was to arrive, and I fancy that he will be  before rather than behind time.\"    Indeed, upon reaching the door of his room Harry found the young  count standing there.    \"Oh, it is you, friend Harry! I have been here ten minutes, and I  began to be afraid that something might have happened to you and  to imagine all sorts of things.\"    \"It is still three or four minutes before the time we agreed upon,  Victor,\" Harry said in a loud voice, for at this moment one of the  other doors opened, and a woman came out with a basket in her arms.    \"I have been looking about as usual, but without luck so far. I  suppose you have had no better fortune in your search for work?\"  He had by this time unlocked his door, and the two entered together.    \"I must call you by your Christian name, count, and will do so, if  you don't mind, when alone as at other times, otherwise the title  might slip out accidentally. Will you, on your part, call me Henri?  As you know the marquis and his family called me Harry, which is  the ordinary way in England of calling anyone whose name is Henry,  that is unless he is a soft sort of fellow; but I must ask them to  call me Henri now, Harry would never do here.\"    \"Have you seen them?\" was the count's first question.    \"I have just left them, Victor, and if you look out from that window  into the street you will in a few minutes see them also; they are  just going for a ramble towards St. Denis, and we will follow them.  I thought it safer not to attract attention by going to the house,  and I also thought that it would be more pleasant for you to talk  to Mademoiselle de St. Caux out there in the fields, than in a  little room with us present.    \"Much more pleasant; indeed, I was wondering whether I should get  an opportunity for a few minutes' talk alone with her.\"    They both took their places at the open window and leaned out  apparently chatting and carelessly watching what was passing in  the street.    A quarter of an hour later they saw Louise Moulin and the girls  come out of their house.    \"We had better come away from the window now,\" Harry said; \"Virginie  might look up and nod, we can't be too careful.\"    They waited three or four minutes to allow the others to get well  ahead and then started out after them; they walked fast until they  caught sight of the others, and then kept some distance behind  until the party had left the town and were out among the fields  which lay between Paris and St. Denis. They then quickened their  pace and were soon up with them.    The greeting between the lovers was a silent one, few words were  spoken, but their faces expressed their joy at meeting again after  the perils through which they had passed; there was a little pause,  and then Harry, as usual, took the lead.    \"I will stroll on to St. Denis and back with Jeanne and Virginie;  Madame Moulin can sit down on that log over there, and go on with  her knitting; you, Victor, can ramble on with mademoiselle by that  path through the field; we will agree to meet here again in an  hour.\"    This arrangement was carried out; Jeanne and Virginie really enjoyed  their walk; the latter thought their disguise was great fun, and,  being naturally a little mimic, imitated so well the walk and  manner of the country children she had seen in her walks near the  chateau that her sister and Harry were greatly amused.    \"I like this too, Harry,\" Jeanne said. \"It would not be nice to be  a peasant girl for many things; but it must be joyful to be able  to walk, and run, and do just as you please, without having a  gouvernante always with you to say, Hold up your head, Mademoiselle  Jeanne; Do not swing your arms, Mademoiselle Jeanne; Please walk  more sedately, Mademoiselle Jeanne. Oh, it was hateful! Now we  might run, mightn't we, Harry?\"    \"Oh, by the way, Jeanne, please call me Henri now; Harry is English,  and people would notice directly if you happened to say it while  anyone is near.\"    \"I like Harry best,\" Jeanne said; \"but, of course, I should not  say it before the people; but may we run just for once?\"    \"Certainly you may,\" Harry laughed; \"you and Virginie can have a  race to the corner of that wall.\"    \"Come on, Virginie,\" Jeanne cried as she started,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#18)"],[1," and  sizes.    The conditions of the large rivers of Newfoundland are different from  the conditions of the small streams of Maine, Long Island, and Cape  Cod; hence the differing desires of the trout in these differing  waters. There is no similarity in the quiet, tiny trout brooks of Long  Island and the broad torrential rivers of Newfoundland, and it is only  natural that the fishes of these deeply contrasting waters should be  widely separated in character--instinct, desires, color, shape, size,  etc. So I do not hesitate to express a belief that the sea trout, no  matter where we find it, is just our own fond _fontinalis_ incognito.    Between Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, there are many wild sea trout  rivers where the fish have never seen a human being. Angle from the  middle of June to the end of August. In June large sea trout are  caught in salt water at the mouth of rivers on the artificial fly and  minnow bait. The best east shore sea trout streams are St. Mary's,  Muscadoboit. Tangier, Cole Harbor, Petpeswick, Quoddy, Sheet Harbor,  Moser's River, Half-way Brook, Smith Brook, Ecwon Secum, Isaac's  Harbor, and about Guysboro.    Southwest of Halifax great sea trout fishing may be had at Ingram  River, Nine Mile River, Hubley's. Indian River, and about Liverpool,  Chester, and the salmon country about Medway.    In New Brunswick beautiful and prolific sea trout waters may be  reached from the towns of New Castle (Miramichi River and  branches--May and June). Chatham (Miramichi River, Tabusintac River,  Bartibog River, Eskeldoc River), Bathhurst (Nipisguit River,  Tetagouche River, Caroquet River, Pockmouche River), and Campbellton,  in the Baie de Chaleur River, Restigouche River, and the Cascapedia.  Metapedia, Upsalquitch, Nouvelle, Escuminac rivers.    My choice of sea trout flies includes: Brown Hackle. Claret, Cinamon,  Codun, Jenny Lind, Parmachenee Belle, Montreal, Grouse, Silver Doctor.  Use sober-hued patterns in fresh water; bright patterns in salt water.  Hooks: Nos. 7 to 12.          CHAPTER XVI    HOOKING THE TROUT    \"Give plenty of time for the fish to swallow the hook,\" says O. W.  Smith, in _Outdoor Life_ (December, 1914), addressing the croppie  (strawberry bass) Angler.      It is not un-anglerlike to catch any fish hooked beyond the lips?  Angling has its gentle qualities as well as its practical ends. It's  different in mere fishing. I don't believe any Angler would purposely  hook his game otherwise than in the lip--a nerveless center where  there is no pain--though the plain fisherman may resort to any method  in his pursuit.    I remember some years ago when two fishermen caught the same fish (a  large fluke), one hook being in the fish's mouth and the other hook on  the inside of the fish's stomach, it was decided after a long  discussion that the fish really belonged to the man whose hook held to  the mouth; the swallowed hook was judged as illegitimate.    Fishes hooked in the mouth do not suffer any pain. I've recaught many  a once-lost specimen with my snell in its lip; these in both fresh  water and salt water. Incidents of this character furnish one of the  many proofs that mouth-hooking the fish is perfectly humane. Two  friends witnessed my catch (July 11, 1915) of a Long Island  two-and-one-quarter-pound brook trout that had a fly and leader (my  first cast) dangling from its mouth, the gear he broke away with a few  minutes before his actual capture.    There is no need of subjecting fishes to any pain in angling. Hook  them in the lips, and kill them the very second they are taken from  the water. Letting them die slowly not only pains the captured fishes,  but injures them as food.    Be a sportsman in angling as well as in hunting. The chivalric gunner,  unlike the market shooter, does not pot his quail huddled stationary  on the ground; he gallantly takes it on the wing--gives it a fair  chance. So the Angler, unlike the trade fisher, gives his game fair  play. I catch quite my share of many species of fishes, but I only  rarely suffer them to swallow the bait, and this by accident. Even  pickerel and fluke (plaice) can be abundantly taken by being hooked in  the lips. I never allow the pickerel or the black bass to swallow the  bait; I hook them in the lip as I hook my trout--on the wing, as it  were.          CHAPTER XVII    DOCTOR NATURE        \"The wise for cure on exercise depend;      God never made His work for man to mend.\"        \"He that takes no holiday hastens a long rest.\"      Game is not the only thing sought for by many men and women who go  angling and shooting. Wise Lord Russell used to ride to the hounds  until he bagged an appetite, then turn suddenly and ride as hard as  possible to the nearest farmhouse and eat a hearty meal. Audubon and  Wilson went afield to study ornithology; Gray and Thoreau for the  study of general natural history, and thousands upon thousands of men  and women less famous have gone afield with rod and gun for still  another quarry--health.    Lord Russell's appetite hunting reminds me of the case of a young  invalid whom I once took on a trout fishing trip. The young man had  been ill all his life. Nobody seemed to know what his complaint was,  but everybody he came in contact with agreed that he was ill. He  looked it, and often said he was born that way. I defined his case the  first day I met him--the city complaint, a complication of general  under-the-weather-ness that is brought about by foul air, improper  exercise, steady indoor work, irregularity, cigarettes, and incorrect  food incorrectly eaten. He's well now. He went out in the woods for  two weeks every three months for six years, and at present he's as  fat and solid as a Delaware shad. I shall never forget his expression  when he hooked his first breath of fresh air and creeled a genuine  outdoor appetite. A woods appetite is very different from the hunger  that once in a while comes to the always-in-the-city man. It strikes  suddenly, one's knees begin to shake, and a cold perspiration breaks  out on the forehead. My poor young friend, having never previously  experienced an appetite, of course didn't know what had taken hold of  him. He began to cry and totter, and I stepped up to him just in time  to save him from falling off a moss-covered rock into a roaring trout  stream.    \"I'm ill,\" he said, \"have been ill all my life. I thought this trip  would do me good but I'm worse. Please let me lie down; I'm very  faint.\"    \"Oh, come,\" said I, \"you're only hungry; here, give me your rod, and  lean on my arm; you'll be all right in a little while.\"    I took him up to the farmhouse and started him slowly on some deviled  trout and watercress. Poor fellow, he reminded me of a young setter  dog born and brought up in the city and taken afield for the first  time. Well, that young man did nothing but cry and eat for two weeks.  He then went home to tell his folks he had come to life, and then  hurried out to feed and weep for another month. I know a hundred young  men and women in New York who are in a bad way with the city  complaint. The streets are filled with ghost-like creatures. Lord  Derby is right: \"If you do not find time for exercise you will have to  find time for illness.\"      \"To-morrow we will go a-fishing; do thou go now and fetch the bait.\"  --Hymir to Thar.          CHAPTER XVIII    THE BROOK TROUT        \"Then, give me the trout of the mountain stream.      With his crimson stars and his golden gleam;      When he, like a hero, on the moss lies.      The Angler has won his fairest prize!\"            AUTHOR UNKNOWN.      =Trout Taking Flies.=--\"Trout invariably strike the insect first with  their tails, knocking it into the water and then devouring it with a  swift dart which can hardly be distinguished from the original  movement, so quickly does one succeed the other.\"--W. C. Prime.    =Trout Colors.=--The color of a trout's back depends on the color of  the bottom of the river. Rapidly growing trout differ greatly in spots  and color from those which grow slowly and thrive badly. A middle-aged  trout differs in color from an aged trout. Speaking generally, the  young, healthy, fast-growing fish will have silvery sides, white  belly, and plenty of well-defined spots. The poorly fed fish will have  few or no spots, a drab belly, and muddy yellow sides. Old trout are  particularly lank and large-headed.    =Tame Trout.=--An English gentleman has two brook trout that take  flies from his fingers, and that ring a little bell cord when they  are hungry. They were taught this latter performance by having bits of  food tied to the cord when it was first introduced.    =Wild Trout and Tame.=--\"Somehow the catching of, as it were,  stall-fed trout has not the same charm as the fishing for the wild  trout. The domestics lack that fierce rush and dash of the wild  beauty.\"--John B. Robinson.    =Sight, Hearing, etc., of Trout.=--\"There is no question ... as to the  high development of the senses of sight, taste, and hearing in  trout.\"--Wm. C. Harris.    =Trout at Play.=--\"Many times have I leaned over the sides of my boat  in Northern waters, where the trout lay beneath me, and seen the  mottled beauties chase each other, and race and leap in rivalry of  sport, until their bright sides irradiated the dark stream with  glancing light, as if the rays of the sun had taken water and were at  their bath.\"--W. H. H. Murry.    =Trout in Hungary.=--The streams of Hungary afford excellent angling  for trout and grayling.    =Unidentified Trout.=--M. P. Dunham of Ovando. Montana, a sportsman's  guide of many years' experience, writes me: \"We have two trout here in  Montana that I do not find pictured in _The Angler's Guide_ or any  other book I have seen containing the technical portraits of the  fishes. One of these trout weighs up to forty-nine pounds and its  average weights are twelve pounds to fifteen pounds. The other is a  small trout that"]]]
