If the line of the shoulders and pectorals slopes from right  to left (the man resting on his right leg) the line across the  hips takes the reverse slope, and is followed by that of the  knees, while the line of the first echoes that of the shoulders.  Thus we get the rhythm ABBA, and the balancing volumes set up  a corresponding play of planes.  Michael Angelo so turns the  body on itself that he reduces the four to two big planes, one  facing, the other swept round to the side of the block.\"  That  is, he gets geometrical enveloping lines for his design.  And,  in fact, there is no sculpture which is more wonderful in  design than Rodin's.  I quote Mr. MacColl again.  \"It has been  said that the 'Bourgeois de Calais' is a group of single  figures, possessing no unity of design, or at best affording  only a single point of view.  Those who say so have never  examined it with attention.  The way in which these figures  move among themselves, as the spectator walks round, so as to  produce from every fresh angle sweeping commanding lines, each  of them thus playing a dozen parts at once, is surely one of  the most astounding feats of the genius of design.  Nothing in  the history of art is exactly comparable with it.\"    <1> D. S. MacColl, _Nineteenth Century Art_, 1902, p. 101.    In short, it is the design, for all his words, that Rodin cares  for.  He calls it Nature, because he sees, and can see Nature  only that way.  But as he said to some one who suggested that  there might be a danger in too close devotion to Nature, \"Yes,  for a mediocre artist!\"  It is for the sake of the strange new  beauty, \"the unedited poses,\" \"the odd beautiful huddle<1> of  lines,\" in a stopping or squatting form, that all these wild  and subtle moments are portrayed.  The limbs must be adjusted  or surprised in some pattern beyond their own.  The ideas are  the occasion and the excuse for new outlines,--that is all.    <1> Said of Degas.  MacColl.    This is all scarcely less true of Millet, whom we have known  above all as the painter who has shown the simple common lot  of labor as divine.  But he, too, is artist for the sake of  beauty first.  He sees two peasant women, one laden with grass,  the other with fagots.  \"From far off, they are superb, they  balance their shoulders under the weight of fatigue, the  twilight swallows their forms.  It is beautiful, it is great  as a myster.\"<1>    <1> Sensier, _Vie et Oeuvre de J.-F. Millet_.    The idea is, as I said, from this point of view, a means to  new beauty; and the stranger and subtler the idea, the more  original the forms.  The more unrestrained the expression of  emotion in the figures, the more chance to surprise them in  some new lovely pattern.  It is thus, I believe, that we may  interpret the seeming trend of modern sculpture, and so much,  indeed, of all modern art, to the \"expressive beauty\" path.  \"The mediocre artist\" will lose beauty in seeking expression,  the great artist will pursue his idea for the sake of the  new beauty it will yield.    Thus it seems that the stumbling blocks in the way of our  theory are not insurmountable after all.  From every point  of view, it is seen to be possible to transmute the idea into  a helpmeet to the form.  Visual beauty is first beauty to the  eye and to the frame, and the mind cherishes and enriches  this beauty with all its own stored treasures.  The stimulation  and repose of the psychophysical organism alone can make one  thrill to visual form; but the thrill is deeper and more  satisfying if it engage the whole man, and be reinforced from  all sources.      VII    But we ought to note a borderland in which the concern is  professedly not with beauty, but with ideas of life.  Aristotle's  lover of knowledge, who rejoiced to say of a picture \"This is  that man,\" is the inspirer of drawing as opposed to the art of  visual form.    It is not beauty we seek from the Rembrandt and Durer of the  etchings and woodcuts, from Hogarth, Goya, Klinger, down to  Leech and Keene and Du Maurier; it is not beauty, but ideas,--  information, irony, satire, life-philosophy.  Where there is  a conflict, beauty, as we have defined it, goes to the wall.  We may trace, perhaps, the ground of this in the highly increased  amount of symbolic, associative power given, and required, in  the black and white.  Even to understand such a picture demands  such an enormous amount of unconscious mental supplementation  that it is natural to find the aesthetic centre of gravity in  that element.    The first conditions of the work, that is, determine its trend  and aim.  The part played by imagination in our vision of an  etching is and must be so important, that it is, after all, the  imaginative part which outweighs the given.  Nor do we desire the  given to infringe upon the ideal field.  Thus do we understand  that for most drawings a background vague and formless is the  desideratum.  \"Such a tone is the foil for psychological  moments, as they are handled by Goya, for instance, with  barbarically magnificent nakedness.  On a background which is  scarcely indicated, with few strokes, which barely suggest  space, he impales like a butterfly the human type, mostly in a  moment of folly or wickedness....  The least definition of  surrounding would blunt his (the artist's) keenness, and make  his vehemence absurd.\"<1>    <1> Max Klinger, _Malerei u. Zeichnung_, 1903, p. 42.    This theory of the aim of black and white is confirmed by the  fact that while a painting is composed for the size in which it  is painted, and becomes another picture if reproduced in another  measure, the size of drawings is relatively indifferent; reduced  or enlarged, the effect is approximately the same, because what  is given to the eye is such a small proportion of the whole  experience.  The picture is only the cue for a complete structure  of ideas.    Here is a true case of Anders-Streben, that \"partial alienation  from its own limitations, by which the arts are able, not indeed  to supply the place of each other, but reciprocally to lend each  other new forces.\"<1>  It is by its success as representation  that the art of the burin and needle--Griffelkunst, as Klinger  names it--ought first to be judged.  This is not saying that it  may not also possess beauty of form to a high degree,--only that  this beauty of form is not its characteristic excellence.    <1> W. Pater, _The Renaissance: Essay on Giorgione_.    In what consists the beauty of visual form?  If this question  could be answered in a sentence our whole discussion of the  abstract formula for beauty would have been unnecessary.  But  since we know what the elements of visual form must do to bring  about the aesthetic experience, it has been the aim of the  preceding pages to show how those elements must be determined  and related.  The eye, the psychophysical organism, must be  favorably stimulated; these, and such colors, combinations,  lines as we have described, are fitted to do it.  It must be  brought to repose; these, and such relations between lines and  colors as we have set forth, are fitted to do it, for reasons  we have given.  It is to the eye and all that waits upon it  that the first and the last appeal of fine art must be made;  and in so far as the emotion or the idea belonging to a  picture or a statue waits upon the eye, in so far does it  enter into the characteristic excellence, that is, the beauty  of visual form.      B.  SPACE COMPOSITION AMONG THE OLD MASTERS    I    THE preceding pages have set forth the concrete facts of  visible beauty, and the explanation of our feelings about it.  It is also interesting, however, to see how these principles  are illustrated and confirmed in the masterpieces of art.  A  statistical study, undertaken some years ago with the purpose  of dealing thus with the hypothesis of substitutional symmetry  in pictorial composition, has given abundance of material,  which I shall set forth, at otherwise disproportionate length,  as to a certain extent illustrative of the methods of such  study.  It is clear that this is but one of many possible  investigations in which the preceding psychological theories  may be further illuminated.  The text confines itself to  pictures; but the functions of the elements of visual form  are valid as well for all visual art destined to fill a bounded  area.  The discussion will then be seen to be only ostensibly  limited in its reference.  For picture might always be read  space arrangement within a frame.    In the original experimental study of space arrangements, the  results of which were given at length on page 111, the elements  of form in a picture were reduced to SIZE or MASS, DEPTH in the  third dimension, DIRECTION, and INTEREST.  Direction was further  analyzed into direction of MOTION or ATTENTION (of persons or  objects in the picture), an ideal element, that is; and direction  of LINE.  For the statistical study, a given picture was then  divided in half by an imaginary vertical line, and the elements  appearing on each side of this line were set off against each  other to see how far they lent themselves to description by  substitutional symmetry.  Thus:  in B. van der Helst's \"Portrait  of Paul Potter,\" the head of the subject is entirely to left  of the central line, as also his full face and frontward glance.  His easel is right, his body turned sharply to right, and both  hands, one holding palette and brushes, are stretched down to  right.  Thus the greater mass is to the left, and the general  direction of line is to the right; elements of interest in the  head, left; in implements, right.  This may be schematized in  the equation (Lt.)M.+I.=(Rt.)I.+L.    Pieter de Hooch, \"The Card-Players,\" in Buckingham Palace,  portrays a group completely on the right of the central line,  all facing in to the table between them.

They have become not decomposed, but mummified.    I expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses  left to rot in the open air. On the contrary, the birds have dried and  hardened, without undergoing any change. What did they want for their  putrefaction? simply the intervention of the Fly. The maggot,  therefore, is the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is,  above all, the putrefactive chemist.    A conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game-bags.  In our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung  unprotected from the hooks on the stalls. Larks strung up by the dozen  with a wire through their nostrils, Thrushes, Plovers, Teal,  Partridges, Snipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the  autumn migration brings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of  the Flies. The buyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior;  he makes his purchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being  prepared for roasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive  with worms. O horror! There is nothing for it but to throw the  loathsome, verminous thing away.    The Bluebottle is the culprit here. Everybody knows it, and nobody  thinks seriously of shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the  wholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game. What is wanted to keep  the maggots out? Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper  sheath. If this precaution were taken at the start, before the Flies  arrive, any game would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain  the degree of ripeness required by the epicure's palate.    Stuffed with olives and myrtleberries, the Corsican Blackbirds are  exquisite eating. We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,  packed in baskets through which the air circulates freely and each  contained in a paper wrapper. They are in a state of perfect  preservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.  I congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of  clothing his Blackbirds in paper. Will his example find imitators? I  doubt it.    There is, of course, a serious objection to this method of  preservation. In its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not  enticing; it does not inform the passer-by of its nature and qualities.  There is one resource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply  to case the head in a paper cap. The head being the part most menaced,  because of the mucous membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be  enough, as a rule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies  and thwart their attempts.    Let us continue to study the Bluebottle, while varying our means of  information. A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of  butcher's meat. The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a  narrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of  the passage of a fine needle. When the bait begins to give off a gamy  scent, the mothers come, singly or in numbers. They are attracted by  the odour which, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my  nostrils.    They explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.  Finding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they  decide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.  Sometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the  ovipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of  the slit. Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly  regular and absolutely white layer.    We have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,  notwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,  without hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal. Can the nature  of the floor make any difference to her? I replace the tin lid by a  paper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice. With the point of my  knife I make a narrow slit in this new lid. That is quite enough: the  parent accepts the paper.    What determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can  easily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the  crevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched  outside, near the narrow passage. The maggots' mother has her own  logic, her prudent foresight. She knows how feeble her wee grubs will  be, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any  resistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains  from laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the  new-born worms can slip unaided.    I wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of  hardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the  decision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional  conditions. With this object in view, I employed small jars, each  baited with a bit of butcher's meat. The respective lids were made of  different-coloured paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,  with its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing  liqueur-bottles. On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with  any desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife  had made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited  and all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the  gash. The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or  brilliant, drab or coloured: these are details of no importance; the  thing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs  to enter.    Though hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the  new-born worms are well able to find their refectory. As they release  themselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their  scent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the  passage cut by the knife. Behold them entering upon their promised  land, their reeking paradise.    Eager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall? Not they!  Slowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use  their fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel  in one. They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.    Let us continue our investigation, varying the conditions. A large  test-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a  lump of butcher's meat. It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two  millimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the  Fly's passage. The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent  rather than sight. She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are  veiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open  tube. The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.    She stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;  but, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the  wire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs  upon it for certain. As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to  the Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).    This Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in  the strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,  and easily shows me what I wish to see. She explores the trellis-work,  chooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,  undisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain  number of grubs, about ten or so. True, her visits will be repeated,  increasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.    The new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to  the wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into  the chasm. It is a nine-inch drop at least. When this is done, the  mother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift  for themselves. If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall  elsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.    This confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no  indication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation. From what  height will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop? I top the  test-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.  The mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a  slight cut in it. Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches  in height. No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of  the young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with  larvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the  fringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the  petals of a little flower. I did not see the mother operating: I was  not there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,  nor of the great dive taken by the family: the contents of the  test-tube furnish me with a duly authenticated certificate.    I admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube  by another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high. The  column is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light. Its  mouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various  other appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or  awaiting their colony of vermin. When the position is well-known to the  Flies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors  should turn aside to easier ground.    From time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the  trellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp. Throughout  the summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where  it is, without result: never a worm. What is the reason? Does the  stench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth? Certainly it  spreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still"]]]
