By scanning open areas from a distance with binoculars,  an observer frequently could determine what turtles were doing without  disturbing them. In the final analysis of data, temperature records  accompanied by data insufficient to determine correctly the state of  activity of the turtle, were discarded, as were temperature records of  injured turtles and turtles in livetraps.    Cowles and Bogert (1944:275-276) and Woodbury and Hardy (1948:177)  emphasized the influence of soil temperatures on body temperatures. It  is thought that air temperatures played a more important role than  soil temperatures in influencing body temperatures of _T. ornata_.  Soil temperatures were taken in the present study only when the turtle  was in a form, hibernaculum, or den.      Optimum Temperature    Cowles and Bogert (1944:277) determined optimum levels of body  temperature of desert reptiles by averaging body temperatures falling  within the range of normal activity; they defined this range as, \"...  extending from the resumption of ordinary routine [activity] ... to  ... a point just below the level at which high temperatures drive the  animal to shelter.\" Fitch (1956b:439) considered optimum body  temperature in the several species that he studied to be near the  temperature recorded most frequently for \"active\" individuals; he  found (_loc. cit._) that of body temperatures of 55 active _T.  ornata_, 66 per cent were between 24 and 30 degrees, and that the  temperatures 27 and 28 occurred most frequently. Fitch concluded (_op.  cit._:473) that the probable optimum body temperature of _T. ornata_  was 28 degrees and that temperatures from 24 to 30 degrees were  preferred. Although Fitch treated all non-torpid individuals that were  abroad in daytime as \"active\" and did not consider the phenomenon of  basking, his observations on optimum body temperature agree closely  with my own.    Body temperatures of 153 box turtles that were known definitely to be  active, ranged from 15.3 to 35.3 degrees. The mean body temperature  for active turtles was 28.8 degrees (A+- 3.78[sigma]) (Fig. 22).  Ninety-two per cent of the temperatures were between 24 and 30 degrees  and 50 per cent were between 28 and 32; temperatures of 29 and 30  degrees occurred most frequently (22 and 21 times, respectively). The  ten body temperatures below 24 degrees all were recorded before 9 A.  M. on overcast days when the air was cool and humid. It is noteworthy  that two of these low temperatures (18.8A deg. and 19.0A deg.) were from a  copulating pair of turtles; two others (21.8A deg. and 22.0A deg.) were from  individuals that were eating. The highest temperature (35.3A deg.) was from  a large female that was feeding at mid-morning in a partly shaded  area.    The mean body temperature for active individuals (Fig. 22) is probably  somewhat below the ecological optimum, because a few temperatures were  abnormally low. The large number of body temperatures in the range of  29 to 31 degrees indicates an optimum closer to 30 degrees. Optimum  body temperatures may vary somewhat with the size, sex, or individual  preference of the turtle concerned.      Basking    Although basking is common in terrestrial turtles, only a few authors  have mentioned it. Woodbury and Hardy (1948:177-178) did not use the  term in their account of thermal relationships in _Gopherus agassizi_;  their discussion indicates, however, that the tortoises move  alternately from sunny to shady areas to regulate body temperature.  Desert tortoises removed from hibernacula and placed in the sun warmed  to approximately 29.5 degrees before they became active, although a  few did so at temperatures as low as 15 degrees. According to Cagle  (1950:45), Sergeev (1939) studied body temperature and activity in the  Asiatic tortoise, _Testudo horsefieldi_, and found that individuals  basked for as much as two hours in the morning before beginning the  first activity of the day (feeding), but that tortoises did not bask  after a period of quiescense from late morning to late afternoon,  during which body temperatures were seemingly maintained nearer the  optimum than they were during nocturnal rest; body temperatures rose  to approximately 30 degrees before the tortoises became active. Since  body temperatures of 23 to 24 degrees were maintained at night, the  basking range of _Testudo horsefieldi_ may be considered to be  approximately 23 to 32 degrees.    Ornate box turtles basked chiefly between sunrise and 10 or 11 A. M.  Body temperatures of 60 basking turtles ranged from 17.3 to 31.4  degrees (mean, 25.5 A+- 3.08[sigma]). More than two-thirds (42) of these  body temperatures were higher than the air temperature near the  turtle, indicating probably that body temperature rises rapidly once  basking is begun. In the instances where body temperature was below  air temperature, the turtles had recently begun to bask (many were  known to have just emerged from forms or other cover where they had  spent the night) or were warming up more slowly because of reduced  sunlight. On cloudy days basking began later than on clear days and  body temperatures usually remained at a suboptimum level. Turtles that  basked on days that were cloudy and windy, or cold and windy, did so  in sheltered places, usually on the leeward sides of windbreaks such  as limestone rocks, rock fences, or ravine banks. It was evident in  these instances that the turtles either sought such shelter from the  wind or remained ensconced in the more complete shelter of a form or  burrow, not emerging at all.    Open areas of various kinds were used as basking sites. Level  ground--such as on roads, cattle pathways, and bare areas surrounding  farm ponds--having unobstructed morning sunlight, nearby dense  vegetation, and choice opportunities for feeding (cow dung, mulberry  trees) was preferred. Basking was frequently combined with feeding; in  several instances box turtles were noted early in the morning at  suboptimum body temperatures eating grasshoppers, berries, or dung  insects. The predilection of box turtles for open areas is probably  important in permitting extended activity at suboptimum temperatures.  _T. ornata_ probably carries on more nearly normal activity on cool  days than do reptilian species with more sharply delimited thermal  tolerances. Collared lizards (_Crotaphytus collaris_), for example,  are chiefly inactive on days when the sky is overcast, although a few  individuals having suboptimum body temperatures can be found in open  situations (Fitch, 1956a:229 and 1956b:442).       [Illustration: FIG. 22. The relationship of body temperature         (Centigrade) and kind of activity in _T. o. ornata_, compiled         from 355 field observations. Vertical and horizontal lines         represent, respectively, the range and mean. Open and solid         rectangles represent one standard deviation and two standard         errors of the mean, respectively.]      Toleration of Thermal Maxima and Minima    The foregoing remarks on basking indicate the approximate, normal,  thermal tolerances of ornate box turtles. Many additional records of  body temperature were taken from turtles that were found under cover.  Turtles under cover in daylight were usually seeking protection from  either below-optimum or above-optimum temperatures. In avoiding low  temperatures, turtles usually chose more complete and permanent cover  than in avoiding high temperatures.    Body temperatures of 64 box turtles that were seeking cover or that  were under cover because of high temperatures ranged from 28.9 to 35.8  degrees (mean, 31.9 A+- 1.55[sigma]). Fifty-nine of these temperatures  (92 per cent) were 30 degrees or higher. Figure 22 shows this range to  overlap broadly with the temperature range of active turtles and the  means of the two groups are close to each other. Body temperatures  below 30 degrees (5) were all recorded late in the morning on hot  summer days when the air temperature was well above 30 degrees; they  are somewhat misleading because they are from turtles that were under  cover long enough to lower body temperature to the range of activity  although the turtles remained under cover because of hazardous  environmental temperatures.    The commonest retreats used by box turtles to escape heat were burrows  of other animals and small dens under thick limestone rocks, where the  air remained cool, even in late afternoon. Most of the burrows and  dens on the Damm Farm were known to me and could be checked each day.  Turtles seeking temporary refuge from high temperatures  characteristically rested just inside the opening of a den or burrow.  Less frequently, turtles burrowed into ravine banks or just under the  sod on level ground. A number of individuals with above-optimum body  temperatures were found in the shade of trees or high weeds in early  afternoon on hot days. Mulberry trees provided ample shade for such  activity and, in June and July, when ripe mulberries were abundant on  the ground, turtles frequently fed on them at times of the day when  temperatures were more hazardous in other areas.    Several turtles were found buried in mud or immersed in water at the  edges of ponds in the hottest part of the day; they were discovered at  first by accident and, on subsequent field trips by systematic  probing. Ordinarily the turtles were covered with mud or muddy water  and remained motionless, except for periodically raising the head to  the surface to breath. There was little vegetation near the edges of  ponds and by late morning on hot days the temperature of the  shallowest water was as high as the air temperature or higher.  Correspondingly, turtles found resting in mud and water had body  temperatures much higher than turtles in dens, burrows, or forms at  the same time of day. Box turtles that retreat to mud or shallow water  cool themselves less efficiently "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#18)"],[1," along a 1-1/2-mile stretch of Birch Lake and nearby  Polaris Lake (Minnesota-Ontario border). One large doe was completely  uneaten and remained so for at least 24 hours after discovery from the  air. Further, one fawn had only a few pounds of flesh eaten, a yearling  doe was half eaten, and another fawn was about 75 percent eaten.  Hazardous landing conditions during this period severely limited the  number of carcasses that could be examined from the ground, but on  February 6 a yearling doe was discovered that had only about 5 to 10  pounds of flesh eaten, and on February 8 an adult doe was found that  was completely intact except for wounds.    In past winters some kills had been located that had been only partly  eaten, but in each case the carcasses were soon revisited and cleaned  up (Mech 1970). This was often not the case in 1969. For the rest of  the winter most of the deer killed by wolves in our study area were not  as completely consumed as in previous winters. Pimlott _et al._ (1969)  found a similar relationship between the severity of the winter and  the degree to which wolf-killed deer were utilized.    Correlated with the above information was the kill history of our  radiotagged wolves (Mech _et al._, p. 1). From December 1968 through  January 1969 No. 1051 had killed three or possibly four deer, and  generally had spent 6 or 7 days feeding on each. However, throughout  most of February this animal visited a new deer carcass (which  presumably he killed) every 3 days, and he spent only 1 or 2 days at  each. In two cases two new carcasses were found in the immediate  vicinity of this animal during the same day, and in each case the wolf  spent only 1 day in the area. A second wolf (1053) which had spent most  of December and January scavenging on the remains of both deer and  moose (_Alces alces_) that had died long before, made her first known  kill of a deer on January 31, 1969. The kill rate of the other three  radiotagged wolves also increased, although the data for them are less  complete. The average kill rate for all radiotagged wolves and their  associates was one deer per wolf per 16 to 20 days before February 1,  and one per 8 to 12 days after February 1 (see Mech _et al._, p. 1).    FOOTNOTES:    [36] _M. H. Stenlund. Personal correspondence to L. D. Mech, Oct. 10,  1969._      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS    Under usual snow conditions throughout most of the range of the  white-tailed deer, healthy vigorous individuals can probably escape  most attacks by wolves. Observations by Mech (1966), Rutter and Pimlott  (1968), and Mech _et al._ (p. 1) indicate that a high percentage of  attempts by wolves to kill deer during winter are unsuccessful. This is  further implied by the figures of Pimlott _et al._ (1969) and Mech and  Frenzel (p. 35) showing that at least during winter wolves tend to kill  a disproportionate number of old deer as well as those with various  abnormalities and pathological conditions.    However, during a winter with extremely deep snow, the usual  relationships seem to change somewhat. Fewer deer are able to escape  wolves, and a surplus is killed. This means that some individuals not  vulnerable under the usual snow conditions become vulnerable during  extreme conditions. There are two main possible reasons for this, the  effect of the extreme weather conditions on the health and vigor of the  deer, and the physical effect of the snow on the escapability of the  deer.    In regard to the first possibility, there was limited evidence that  during February and March 1969 some fawns and yearlings in our study  area were losing their fat stores. Two of three yearlings, and both  fawns intact enough for examination during this period lacked back fat,  and the marrow in one of six fawn femurs was partly fat depleted.  Nevertheless, the third yearling inspected still had back fat, and a  3-1/2-year-old doe had heavy omental, renal, heart, and back fat during  the same period. Thus, although an abnormal decline in the physical  condition of some deer in the late winter might partly account for the  increased kill by wolves during February and March 1969, the effect of  snow on the escapability of the deer probably was also involved.    The key difference in snow conditions between the two periods--(1) the  winters of 1966-67, 1967-68, and December-January 1968-69, and (2)  February and March 1969--was the heavy, persisting accumulation of snow  during the latter period, combined with the increasing density of the  snow. As our observations show, this greatly hindered the movements of  deer fleeing from wolves.    Under more usual conditions, a running deer might sink through the snow  to the ground and thus obtain a firm footing from which to spring  again. In discussing wolf-caribou relations in snow, Kelsall (1968, p.  249) stated the following: \"While caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_) will  sink into snow even deeper than wolves, their longer legs permit them  to run efficiently where a wolf will bog down. Nasimovich (1955)  considered that roe deer and sika deer could be taken by wolves when  snow was not more than 30 cm. (11.8 inches) in depth. At depths above  that their pursuit becomes difficult or fruitless.\"    However, it appears that when snow becomes extremely deep, wolves then  gain the advantage. With 22 to 48 inches or more of snow to plow  through, a deer would have trouble even touching a firm foundation.  According to Kelsall (1969), deer measure only 20 to 24 inches from  hoof tip to chest, with legs extended.    It is true that wolves stand even shorter than deer and so might be  expected to flounder even more. However, this is where another factor  becomes important, the \"weight-load-on-track\" or total weight per area  of track. As Kelsall (1969) has pointed out, the mean  weight-load-on-track for deer is extremely difficult to measure  directly, because the actual under-surface of the deer's foot slants  vertically, and a much greater area may be used to support an animal in  snow than on a hard surface. This probably explains the discrepancy  between Kelsall's measurements and work done by Verme (1968) in  Michigan. According to Kelsall, deer weight-load-on-track (hoof only)  varies between 431 and 1,124 gm./cm.^2. However, Verme stated that  his compaction gauge (with a weight load of about 211 gm./cm.^2,  described earlier in this paper) sank in virtually the same amount in  snow as did deer. Under the snow conditions in our study area, we found  that the same type of compaction gauge generally penetrated to a depth  within a half inch of that to which deer were sinking. On this basis,  it seems reasonable to suggest that a deer in snow is supported by more  of its foot than just the hoof, and that the actual  weight-load-on-track of deer in snow is about 211 gm./cm.^2.    For wolves, this measure varies from 89 to 103 gm./cm.^2 (Foromozov  1946). This means that for the same amount of force applied during  running, a wolf would have twice as much support as a deer. It also  means that in deep snow a walking wolf generally is much less  restricted than a walking deer. Late in February 1969, for example,  when deer were seriously limited in their ability to travel, wolves  were able to travel widely (Mech _et al._, p. 1).    Even though wolves have much greater support than deer, when running  they still sink into the snow almost as much as deer under most  conditions, probably because both run with such force that snow usually  offers little support. Nevertheless, with extremely deep snow, the  difference in support factor between wolves and deer could become  critical, and this is probably what happened during February and March  1969. With deer seriously restrained by the deep snow, even a slight  advantage in favor of the wolf could increase hunting success. A high  snow density during that period would accentuate this advantage. This  is because until the snow becomes dense enough to hold a running deer,  each increase in density would further the advantage of the wolf, which  would require only half the density to support it, while it would  hinder the deer.    One result of the extreme snow conditions of early 1969 was that deer  tended to gravitate to lakes, where snow was shallow and footing was  firm. Initially upon disturbance by human beings, and probably by  wolves, these deer usually headed inland, but it is apparent from a  number of kills examined that when pressed hard by wolves inland, deer  headed out onto lakes where possible. Apparently they could run there  with better footing. However, frozen lakes also provide wolves with  good running conditions, and even seem to give them an advantage  (Rutter and Pimlott 1968, Mech 1970), so many of these deer were killed  (fig. 11).    Stenlund (1955, p. 44) reported as follows on years of low snowfall,  the opposite condition, which demonstrated the same relationship  between snow depth and kills on lakes: \"The winters of 1951-52 and  1952-53 were abnormally mild with little early snow. As a result, few  wolf-killed deer appeared on the lakes and most deer attempted to  outrun wolves in the woods.\"    [Illustration: _Figure 11.--On frozen lakes, wolves often seem to have  the advantage over deer, such as in this case where the wolf (center)  has just killed a deer and is trying to discourage a raven from joining  him in the feed. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel_.)]    Thus it appears that extreme snow conditions in our study area increase  the vulnerability of deer to wolf predation in three ways: (1) by  causing a decline in the health and nutritional state of some members  of the deer population; (2) by hindering the escapability of the deer;  and (3) by causing deer to congregate on frozen lakes where wolves have  the advantage in running.      SUMMARY    During the winters of 1966-67, 1967-68, and 1968-69, the interactions  of wolves (_Canis lupus_) and white-tailed deer (_Odocoileu"]]]
