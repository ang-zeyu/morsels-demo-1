The Absolute and Reality are but an Abstraction.    A grain of sand you, trample upon has a deeper significance than a  series of lectures by your verbal philosopher whom you respect.  It  contains within itself the whole history of the earth; it tells you  what it has seen since the dawn of time; while your philosopher  simply plays on abstract terms and empty words.  What does his  Absolute, or One, or Substance mean?  What does his Reality or Truth  imply?  Do they denote or connote anything?  Mere name! mere  abstraction!  One school of philosophy after another has been  established on logical subtleties; thousands of books have been  written on these grand names and fair mirages, which vanish the  moment that your hand of experience reaches after them.    \"Duke Hwan,\" says Chwang Tsz,[FN#134] \"seated above in his hall, was\"  (once) reading a book, and a wheelwright, Phien, was making a wheel  below it.  Laying aside his hammer and chisel, Phien went up the  steps and said: 'I venture to ask your Grace what words you are  reading?'  The duke said: 'The words of sages.'  'Are these sages  alive?' Phien continued.  'They are dead,' was the reply.  'Then,'  said the other, 'what you, my Ruler, are reading is only the dregs  and sediments of those old men.'  The duke said:      [FN#134]  Chwang Tsz, vol. ii., p. 24.      'How should you, a wheelwright, have anything to say about the book  which I am reading?  If you can explain yourself, very well; if you  cannot, you shall die.'  The wheelwright said: 'Your servant will  look at the thing from the point of view of his own art.  In making a  wheel, if I proceed gently, that is pleasant enough, but the  workmanship is not strong; if I proceed violently, that is toilsome  and the joinings do not fit.  If the movements of my hand are neither  (too) gentle nor (too) violent, the idea in my mind is realized.  But  I cannot tell (how to do this) by word of mouth; there is a knack in  it.  I cannot teach the knack to my son, nor can my son learn it from  me.  Thus it is that I am in my seventieth year, and am (still)  making wheels in my old age.  But these ancients, and what it was not  possible for them to convey, are dead and gone.  So then what you, my  Ruler, are reading is but their dregs and sediments.\"  Zen has no  business with the dregs and sediments of sages of yore.        8. The Sermon of the Inanimate.    The Scripture of Zen is written with facts simple and familiar, so  simple and familiar with everyday life that they escape observation  on that very account.  The sun rises in the east.  The moon sets in  the west.  High is the mountain.  Deep is the sea.  Spring comes with  flowers; summer with the cool breeze; autumn with the bright moon;  winter with the fakes of snow.  These things, perhaps too simple and  too familiar for ordinary observers to pay attention to, have had  profound significance for Zen.  Li Ngao (Ri-ko) one day asked Yoh  Shan (Yaku-san): \"What is the way to truth?\"  Yoh Shan, pointing to  the sky and then to the pitcher beside him, said: \"You see?\"  \"No,  sir,\" replied Li Ngao.  \"The cloud is in the sky,\" said Yoh Shan,  \"and the water in the pitcher.\"  Huen Sha (Gen-sha) one day went upon  the platform and was ready to deliver a sermon when he heard a  swallow singing.  \"Listen,\" said he, \"that small bird preaches the  essential doctrine and proclaims the eternal truth.\"  Then he went  back to his room, giving no sermon.[FN#135]      [FN#135]  Den-to-roku and E-gen.      The letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc., have no meaning whatever.   They are but artificial signs, but when spelt they can express any  great idea that great thinkers may form.  Trees, grass, mountains,  rivers, stars, moons, suns.  These are the alphabets with which the  Zen Scripture is written.  Even a, b, c, etc., when spelt, can  express any great idea.  Why not, then, these trees, grass, etc., the  alphabets of Nature when they compose the Volume of the Universe?  Even the meanest clod of earth proclaims the sacred law.    Hwui Chung[FN#136] (E-chu) is said first to have given an expression  to the Sermon of the Inanimate.  \"Do the inanimate preach the  Doctrine?\" asked a monk of Hwui Chung on one occasion.  \"Yes, they  preach eloquently and incessantly.  There is no pause in their  orations,\" was the reply.  \"Why, then, do I not hear them?\" asked the  other again.  \"Even if you do not, there are many others who can hear  them.\"  \"Who can hear them?\"  \"All the sages hear and understand  them,\" said Hwui Chung.  Thus the Sermon of the Inanimate had been a  favourite topic of discussion 900 years before Shakespeare who  expressed the similar idea, saying:    \"And this our life, exempt from public haunt,  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,  Sermons in stones, and good in everything.\"      [FN#136]  A direct disciple of the Sixth Patriarch.      \"How wonderful is the Sermon of the Inanimate,\" says Tung Shan  (To-zan).  \"You cannot hear it through your ears, but you can hear it  through your eyes.\"  You should hear it through your mind's eyes,  through your heart's eyes, through your inmost soul's eyes, not  through your intellect, not through your perception, not through your  knowledge, not through your logic, not through your metaphysics.  To  understand it you have to divine, not to define; you have to observe,  not to calculate; you have to sympathize, not to analyze; you have to  see through, not to criticize; you have not to explain, but to feel;  you have not to abstract, but to grasp; you have to see all in each,  but not to know all in all; you have to get directly at the soul of  things, penetrating their hard crust of matter by your rays of the  innermost consciousness.  \"The falling leaves as well as the blooming  flowers reveal to us the holy law of Buddha,\" says a Japanese Zenist.    Ye who seek for purity and peace, go to Nature.  She will give you  more than ye ask.  Ye who long for strength and perseverance, go to  Nature.  She will train and strengthen you.  Ye who aspire after an  ideal, go to Nature.  She will help you in its realization.  Ye who  yearn after Enlightenment, go to Nature.  She will never fail to  grant your request.            CHAPTER IV        BUDDHA, THE UNIVERSAL SPIRIT      1. The Ancient Buddhist Pantheon.    The ancient Buddhist pantheon was full of deities or Buddhas,  3,000[FN#137] in number, or rather countless, and also of  Bodhisattvas no less than Buddhas.  Nowadays, however, in every  church of Mahayanism one Buddha or another together with some  Bodhisattvas reigns supreme as the sole object of worship, while  other supernatural beings sink in oblivion.  These Enlightened  Beings, regardless of their positions in the pantheon, were generally  regarded as persons who in their past lives cultivated virtues,  underwent austerities, and various sorts of penance, and at length  attained to a complete Enlightenment, by virtue of which they secured  not only peace and eternal bliss, but acquired divers supernatural  powers, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, all-knowledge, and what  not.  Therefore, it is natural that some Mahayanists[FN#138] came to  believe that, if they should go through the same course of discipline  and study, they could attain to the same Enlightenment and Bliss, or  the same Buddhahood, while other Mahayanists[FN#139] came to believe  in the doctrine that the believer is saved and led up to the eternal  state of bliss, without undergoing these hard disciplines, by the  power of a Buddha known as having boundless mercy and fathomless  wisdom whom he invokes.      [FN#137]  Trikalpa-trisahasra-buddhanrama-sutra gives the names of  3,000 Buddhas, and Buddhabhisita-buddhanama-sutra enumerates Buddhas  and Bodhisattvas 11,093 in number.  See Nanjo's Catalogue, Nos. 404,  405, 406, 407.    [FN#138]  Those who believe in the doctrine of Holy Path.  See 'A  History of the Twelve Japanese Buddhist Sects,' pp. 109-111.    [FN#139]  Those who believe in the doctrine of the Pure Land.        2. Zen is Iconoclastic.    For the followers of Bodhidharma, however, this conception of Buddha  seemed too crude to be accepted unhesitatingly and the doctrine too  much irrelevant with and uncongenial to actual life.  Since Zen  denounced, as we have seen in the previous chapter, the scriptural  authority, it is quite reasonable to have given up this view of  Buddha inculcated in the Mahayana sutras, and to set at naught those  statues and images of supernatural beings kept in veneration by the  orthodox Buddhists.  Tan Hia (Tan-ka), a noted Chinese Zen master,  was found warming himself on a cold morning by the fire made of a  wooden statue of Buddha.  On another occasion he was found mounting  astride the statue of a saint.  Chao Chen (Jo-shu) one day happened  to find Wang Yuen (Bun-yen) worshipping the Buddha in the temple, and  forthwith struck him with his staff.  \"Is there not anything good in  the worshipping of the Buddha?\" protested Wang Yuen.  Then the master  said: \"Nothing is better than anything good.\"[FN#140]  These examples  fully illustrate Zen's attitude towards the objects of Buddhist  worship.  Zen is not, nevertheless, iconoclastic in the commonly  accepted sense of the term, nor is it idolatrous, as Christian  missionaries are apt to suppose.      [FN#140]  Zen-rin-rui-shu.      Zen is more iconoclastic than any of the Christian or the Mohammedan  denominations in the sense that it opposes the acceptance of the  petrified idea of Deity, so conventional and formal that it carries  no inner conviction of the believers.

The  twilight of the Land of Twi was now replaced by bright sunshine, and in  the air was the freshness of the near-by sea.    At evening they came to a large farmhouse, where the owner welcomed  them hospitably and gave them the best his house afforded.    In answer to their questions about the Kingdom of Auriel, he shook his  head sadly and replied:    \"It is a rich and beautiful country, but has fallen under great  misfortunes.  For when the good king died, about two years ago, the  kingdom was seized by a fierce and cruel sorcerer, named Kwytoffle, who  rules the people with great severity, and makes them bring him all  their money and valuable possessions.  So every one is now very poor  and unhappy, and that is a great pity in a country so fair and fertile.\"    \"But why do not the people rebel?\" asked Nerle.    \"They dare not rebel,\" answered the farmer, \"because they fear the  sorcery of Kwytoffle.  If they do not obey him he threatens to change  them into grasshoppers and June-bugs.\"    \"Has he ever changed any one into a grasshopper or a June-bug?\" asked  Prince Marvel.    \"No; but the people are too frightened to oppose him, and so he does  not get the opportunity.  And he has an army of fierce soldiers, who  are accustomed to beat the people terribly if they do not carry every  bit of their wealth to the sorcerer.  So there is no choice but to obey  him.\"    \"We certainly ought to hang this wicked creature!\" exclaimed Wul-Takim.    \"I wish I had brought my Fool-Killer with me,\" sighed King Terribus;  \"for I could have kept him quite busy in this kingdom.\"    \"Can not something be done to rescue these poor people from their sad  fate?\" asked the lovely High Ki, anxiously.    \"We will make a call upon this Kwytoffle to-morrow,\" answered Prince  Marvel, \"and see what the fellow is like.\"    \"Alas!  Alas!\" wailed the good farmer, \"you will all become  grasshoppers and June-bugs--every one of you!\"    But none of the party seemed to fear that, and having passed the night  comfortably with the farmer they left his house and journeyed on into  the Kingdom of Auriel.    Before noon they came upon the edge of a forest, where a poor man was  chopping logs into firewood.  Seeing Prince Marvel's party approach,  this man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly:    \"Take the other path!  Take the other path!\"    \"And why should we take the other path?\" inquired the prince, reining  in his steed.    \"Because this one leads to the castle of the great sorcerer,  Kwytoffle,\" answered the man.    \"But there is where we wish to go,\" said Marvel.    \"What!  You wish to go there?\" cried the man.  \"Then you will be robbed  and enslaved!\"    \"Not as long as we are able to fight,\" laughed the big Wul-Takim.    \"If you resist the sorcerer, you will be turned into grasshoppers and  June-bugs,\" declared the man, staring at them in wonder.    \"How do you know that?\" asked Marvel.    \"Kwytoffle says so.  He promises to enchant every one who dares defy  his power.\"    \"Has any one ever yet dared defy him?\" asked Nerle.    \"Certainly not!\" said the man.  \"No one wishes to become a June-bug or  a grasshopper.  No one dares defy him.\".    \"I am anxious to see this sorcerer,\" exclaimed King Terribus.  \"He  ought to prove an interesting person, for he is able to accomplish his  purposes by threats alone.\"    \"Then let us ride on,\" said Marvel.    \"Dear us!  Dear us!\" remonstrated the bald-headed Ki; \"are we to become  grasshoppers, then?\"    \"We shall see,\" returned the prince, briefly.    \"With your long legs,\" added the pretty pair of High Ki, laughingly,  \"you ought to be able to jump farther than any other grasshopper in the  kingdom.\"    \"Great Kika-koo!\" cried the Ki, nervously, \"what a fate! what a  terrible fate!  And your Highnesses, I suppose, will become June-bugs,  and flutter your wings with noises like buzz-saws!\"        21.  The Wonderful Book of Magic    Whatever their fears might be, none of Prince Marvel's party hesitated  to follow him along the path through the forest in search of the  sorcerer, and by and by they came upon a large clearing.  In the middle  of this open space was a big building in such bad repair that its walls  were tumbling down in several places, and all around it the ground was  uncared for and littered with rubbish.  A man was walking up and down  in front of this building, with his head bowed low; but when he heard  the sound of approaching horses' hoofs he looked up and stared for a  moment in amazement.  Then, with a shout of rage, he rushed toward them  and caught Prince Marvel's horse by the bridle.    \"How dare you!\" he cried; \"how dare you enter my forest?\"    Marvel jerked his bridle from the man's grasp and said in return:    \"Who are you?\"    \"Me!  Who am I?  Why, I am the great and powerful Kwytoffle!  So  beware!  Beware my sorcery!\"    They all looked at the man curiously.  He was short and very fat, and  had a face like a puff-ball, with little red eyes and scarcely any nose  at all.  He wore a black gown with scarlet grasshoppers and june-bugs  embroidered upon the cloth; and his hat was high and peaked, with an  imitation grasshopper of extraordinary size perched upon its point.  In  his right hand he carried a small black wand, and around his neck hung  a silver whistle on a silver cord.    Seeing that the strangers were gazing on him so earnestly, Kwytoffle  thought they were frightened; so he said again, in a big voice:    \"Beware my vengeance!\"    \"Beware yourself!\" retorted the prince.  \"For if you do not treat us  more respectfully, I shall have you flogged.\"    \"What!  Flog me!\" shouted Kwytoffle, furiously.  \"For this I will turn  every one of you into grasshoppers--unless you at once give me all the  wealth you possess!\"    \"Poor man!\" exclaimed Nerle; \"I can see you are longing for that  flogging.  Will you have it now?\" and he raised his riding-whip above  his head.    Kwytoffle stumbled backward a few paces and blew shrilly upon his  silver whistle.  Instantly a number of soldiers came running from the  building, others following quickly after them until fully a hundred  rough-looking warriors, armed with swords and axes, had formed in  battle array, facing the little party of Prince Marvel.    \"Arrest these strangers!\" commanded Kwytoffle, in a voice like a roar.  \"Capture them and bind them securely, and then I will change them all  into grasshoppers!\"    \"All right,\" answered the captain of the soldiers; and then he turned  to his men and shouted: \"Forward--double-quick--march!\"    They came on with drawn swords; at first running, and then gradually  dropping into a walk, as they beheld Nerle, Wul-Takim, King Terribus  and Marvel standing quietly waiting to receive them, weapons in hand  and ready for battle.  A few paces off the soldiers hesitated and  stopped altogether, and Kwytoffle yelled at the captain:    \"Why don't you go on?  Why don't you capture them?  Why don't you fight  them?\"    \"Why, they have drawn their swords!\" responded the captain,  reproachfully.    \"Who cares?\" roared the sorcerer.    \"We care,\" said the captain, giving a shudder, as he looked upon the  strangers.  \"Their swords are sharp, and some of us would get hurt.\"    \"You're cowards!\" shrieked the enraged Kwytoffle.  \"I'll turn you all  into June-bugs!\"    At this threat the soldiers dropped their swords and axes, and all fell  upon their knees, trembling visibly and imploring their cruel master  not to change them into june-bugs.    \"Bah!\" cried Nerle, scornfully; \"why don't you fight?  If we kill you,  then you will escape being June-bugs.\"    \"The fact is,\" said the captain, woefully, \"we simply can't fight.  For  our swords are only tin, and our axes are made of wood, with  silver-paper pasted over them.\"    \"But why is that?\" asked Wul-Takim, while all the party showed their  surprise.    \"Why, until now we have never had any need to fight,\" said the captain,  \"for every one has quickly surrendered to us or run away the moment we  came near.  But you people do not appear to be properly frightened, and  now, alas! since you have drawn upon us the great sorcerer's anger, we  shall all be transformed into June-bugs.\"    \"Yes!\" roared Kwytoffle, hopping up and down with anger, \"you shall all  be June-bugs, and these strangers I will transform into grasshoppers!\"    \"Very well,\" said Prince Marvel, quietly; \"you can do it now.\"    \"I will!  I will!\" cried the sorcerer.    \"Then why don't you begin?\" inquired the prince.    \"Why don't I begin?  Why, I haven't got the enchantments with me,  that's why.  Do you suppose we great magicians carry around  enchantments in our pockets?\" returned the other, in a milder tone.    \"Where do you keep your enchantments?\" asked the prince.    \"They're in my dwelling,\" snapped Kwytoffle, taking off his hat and  fanning his fat face with the brim.    \"Then go and get them,\" said Marvel.    \"Nonsense!  If I went to get the enchantments you would all run away!\"  retorted the sorcerer.    \"Not so!\" protested Nerle, who was beginning to be amused.  \"My  greatest longing in life is to become a grasshopper.\"    \"Oh, yes!  PLEASE let us be grasshoppers!\" exclaimed the High Ki maids  in the same breath.    \"We want to hop!  We want to hop!  Please--PLEASE let us hop!\" implored  the bald-headed Ki, winking their left eyes at Wul-Takim.    \"By all means let us become grasshoppers,\" said King Terribus, smiling;  and Wul-Takim added:    \"I'm sure your soldiers would enjoy being June-bugs, for then they  wouldn't have to work.  Isn't that so, boys?\"    The bewildered soldiers looked at one another in perplexity, and the  still more bewildered sorcerer gazed on the speakers with staring eyes  and wide-open mouth.    \"I insist,\" said Prince Marvel, \"upon your turning us into grasshoppers  and your soldiers into"]]]
