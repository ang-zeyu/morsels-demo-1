Order IX. SHORE BIRDS.    LIMICOLAÂ†.         Family 1. PHALAROPES. PhalaropodidA|. 3 species.       Family 2. AVOCETS AND STILTS. RecurvirostridA|. 2 species.       Family 3. SNIPES, SANDPIPERS, ETC. ScolopacidA|. 33 species,          2 subspecies.       Family 4. PLOVERS. CharadriidA|. 9 species, 2 subspecies.       Family 5. SURF BIRDS AND TURNSTONES. AphrizidA|. 4 species.       Family 6. OYSTER-CATCHERS. HA|matopodidA|. 3 species.       Family 7. JACANAS. JacanidA|. 1 species.      The Phalaropes are swimming Snipes. The Northern and Red Phalaropes,  both of which have well-developed lobes or scalloped webs on their  toes, except when nesting, live at sea a hundred miles or more off  shore, where they find an abundance of food in small forms of marine  life. The Wilson Phalarope is a bird of the interior and consequently,  is far less aquatic than the remaining species of the family;  nevertheless it readily takes to water, swimming buoyantly and  gracefully.    Contrary to the general rule, the female Phalarope is larger and more  brightly colored than the male and this difference in size and plumage  is accompanied by similarly unusual habits; the female taking the  place of the male in the Phalarope household. The female of necessity  lays the eggs, but they are hatched by the male alone, who it is said,  cares for the young, also without the assistance of his mate.    The Avocets and Stilts are wading Snipes. The Stilts secure their food  by quick thrusts of the bill, but the Avocets use their singular,  upturned member in a more interesting manner. When in water two or  three inches deep, the bill is dropped below the surface, until the  curved lower mandible evidently touches the bottom; then walking  rapidly, or even running, the bill is swung from side to side and the  bird thus explores the mud in its search for food, which, when it is  felt, is picked up in the usual way.    Many of the members of the family ScolopacidA| are probing Snipe. The  Woodcock, Wilson Snipe, and Dowitcher are good examples. Their bill is  long and sensitive and they can curve or move its tip without opening  it at the base. When the bill is thrust into the mud the tip may  therefore grasp a worm and it thus becomes a finger as well as a  probe.    Though not ranked as song birds, many of the Snipes and Plovers have  pleasing calls and whistles and in the breeding season they become  highly musical or indulge in singular vocal performances.    The song of the Bartramian Sandpiper would attract the attention of  the least observant and the singular aA\"rial evolutions of the Snipe  and Woodcock lend an unusual interest to the study of these birds in  the spring. The Pectoral Sandpiper was observed by Nelson in Alaska,  in May, to fill its A\"sophagus with air dilating the skin of the neck  and breast and forming a sack as large as the body. Then in the air or  on the ground the bird produced a series of hollow booming notes,  constituting its love song.    The Plovers have shorter, harder bills than the true Snipe and several  of our species frequent the uplands rather than muddy shore or tidal  flats.    The Turnstones are true shore birds. Their home with us is on the  seacoast where they feed along the beach turning over shells and  pebbles in their search for food.    The Oyster-catchers are also strictly maritime. They frequent bars  left bare by the tide and, it is said, use their stout bills to force  open mussels; oysters, or other bivalves left exposed by the water.  This belief, however, does not appear to rest on careful, definite  observation.    The Jacana belongs to a small family of birds with representatives  throughout the tropics. All its members are remarkable for the length  of their toes, the wide extent of which enable these birds to walk  over aquatic vegetation. So, for instance, I have seen them running  over small lily leaves which, sinking slightly beneath the surface,  made the birds appear to be walking on the water.    The LimicolA|, as a rule, nest on the ground. The Phalaropes, Snipes,  and Plovers lay four eggs, the Oyster-catcher three, the Jacanas, it  is said, four in some species to ten in others. The eggs of all are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38013"],[0,"Animals of the Past (#18)"],[1,"to each island. Although Moas were  still numerous when man made his appearance in this part of the world,  the large deposits of their bones indicate that they were on the wane,  and that natural causes had already reduced the feathered population of  these islands. A glacial period is believed to have wrought their  destruction, and in one great morass, abounding in springs, their bones  occur in such enormous numbers, layer upon layer, that it is thought the  birds sought the place where the flowing springs might afford their feet  at least some respite from the biting cold, and there perished miserably  by thousands.    What Nature spared man finished, and legends of Moa hunts and Moa feasts  still lingered among the Maoris when the white man came and began in  turn the extermination of the Maori. The theory has been advanced, with  much to support it, that the big birds were eaten off the face of the  earth by an earlier race than the Maoris, and that after the extirpation  of the Moas the craving for flesh naturally led to cannibalism. But by  whomsoever the destruction was wrought, the result was the same, the  habitat of these feathered giants knew them no longer, while multitudes  of charred bones, interspersed with fragments of egg-shells, bear  testimony to former barbaric feasts.    It is a far cry from New Zealand to Madagascar, but thither must we go,  for that island was, pity we cannot say is, inhabited by a race of giant  birds from whose eggs it has been thought may have been hatched the Roc  of Sindbad. Arabian tales, as we all know, locate the Roc either in  Madagascar or in some adjacent island to the north and east, and it is  far from unlikely that legends of the AEpyornis, backed by the  substantial proof of its enormous eggs, may have been the slight  foundation of fact whereon the story-teller erected his structure of  fiction. True, the Roc of fable was a gigantic bird of prey capable of  bearing away an elephant in its talons, while the AEpyornis has shed its  wings and shrunk to dimensions little larger than an ostrich, but this  is the inevitable result of closer acquaintance and the application of a  two-foot rule.    Like the Moa the AEpyornis seems to have lived in tradition long after it  became extinct, for a French history of Madagascar, published as early  as 1658 makes mention of a large bird, or kind of ostrich, said to  inhabit the southern end of the island. Still, in spite of bones having  been found that bear evident traces of the handiwork of man, it is  possible that this and other reports were due to the obvious necessity  of having some bird to account for the presence of the eggs.    The actual introduction of the AEpyornis to science took place in 1834,  when a French traveller sent Jules Verreaux, the ornithologist, a sketch  of a huge egg, saying that he had seen two of that size, one sawed in  twain to make bowls, the other, traversed by a stick, serving in the  preparation of rice uses somewhat in contrast with the proverbial  fragility of egg-shells. A little later another traveller procured some  fragments of egg-shells, but it was not until 1851 that any entire eggs  were obtained, when two were secured, and with a few bones sent to  France, where Geoffroy St. Hilaire bestowed upon them the name of  _AEpyornis maximus_ (the greatest lofty bird). Maximus the eggs remain,  for they still hold the record for size; but so far as the bird that is  supposed to have laid them is concerned, the name was a little  premature, for other and larger species subsequently came to hand.  Between the AEpyornithes and the Moas Science has had a hard time, for  the supply of big words was not large enough to go around, and some had  to do duty twice. In the way of generic names we have Dinornis, terrible  bird; AEpyornis, high bird; Pachyornis, stout bird; and Brontornis,  thunder bird, while for specific names there are robustus, maximus,  titan; gravis, heavy; immanis, enormous; crassus, stout; ingens, great;  and elephantopus, elephant-footed--truly a goodly array of  large-sounding words. But to return to the big eggs! Usually we look  upon those of the ostrich as pretty large, but an ostrich egg measures  4-1/2 by 6 inches, while that of the AEpyornis is 9 by 13 inches; or, to  put it another way, it would hold the contents of six ostrichs' eggs, or  one hundred and forty-eight hens' eggs, or thirty thousand humming  birds' eggs; and while this is very much smaller than a waterbutt, it is  still as large as a bucket, and one or two such eggs might suffice to  make an omelet for Gargantua himself.    The size of an egg is no safe criterion of the size of the bird that  laid it, for a large bird may lay a small egg, or a small bird a large  one. Comparing the egg of the great Moa with that of our AEpyornis one  might think the latter much the larger bird, say twelve feet in height,  when the facts in the case are that while there was no great difference  in the weight of the two, that difference, and a superiority of at least  two feet in height, are in favor of the bird that laid the smaller egg.  The record of large eggs, however, belongs to the Apteryx, a New Zealand  bird smaller than a hen, though distantly related to the Moas, which  lays an egg about one-third of its own weight, measuring 3 by 5 inches;  perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the bird lays but two.    Although most of the eggs of these big birds that have been found have  literally been unearthed from the muck of swamps, now and then one comes  to light in a more interesting manner as, for example, when a perfect  egg of AEpyornis was found afloat after a hurricane, bobbing serenely up  and down with the waves near St. Augustine's Bay, or when an egg of the  Moa was exhumed from an ancient Maori grave, where for years it had lain  unharmed, safely clasped between the skeleton fingers of the occupant.  So far very few of these huge eggs have made their way to this country,  and the only egg of AEpyornis now on this side of the water is the  property of a private individual.    Most recent in point of discovery, but oldest in point of time, are the  giant birds from Patagonia, which are burdened with the name of  Phororhacidae, a name that originated in an error, although the error may  well be excused. The first fragment of one of these great birds to come  to light was a portion of the lower jaw, and this was so massive, so  un-bird-like, that the finder dubbed it _Phororhacos_, and so it must  remain.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Eggs of Feathered Giants, AEpyornis, Ostrich,  Moa, Compared with a Hen's Egg.]    It is a pity that all the large names were used up before this group of  birds was discovered, and it is particularly unfortunate that Dinornis,  terrible bird, was applied to the root-eating Moas, for these Patagonian  birds, with their massive limbs, huge heads and hooked beaks, were truly  worthy of such a name; and although in nowise related to the eagles,  they may in habit have been terrestrial birds of prey. Not all the  members of this family are giants, for as in other groups, some are big  and some little, but the largest among them might be styled the Daniel  Lambert of the feathered race. _Brontornis_, for example, the thunder  bird, or as the irreverent translate it, the thundering big bird, had  leg-bones larger than those of an ox, the drumstick measuring 30 inches  in length by 2-1/2 inches in diameter, or 4-1/4 inches across the ends,  while the tarsus, or lower bone of the leg to which the toes are  attached, was 16-1/2 inches long and 5-1/2 inches wide where the toes  join on. Bear this in mind the next time you see a large turkey, or  compare these bones with those of an ostrich: but lest you may forget,  it may be said that the same bone of a fourteen-pound turkey is 5-1/2  inches long, and one inch wide at either end, while that of an ostrich  measures 19 inches long and 2 inches across the toes, or 3 at the upper  end.    If Brontornis was a heavy-limbed bird, he was not without near rivals  among the Moas, while the great Phororhacos, one of his contemporaries,  was not only nearly as large, but quite unique in build. Imagine a bird  seven or eight feet in height from the sole of his big, sharp-clawed  feet, to the top of his huge head, poise this head on a neck as thick as  that of a horse, arm it with a beak as sharp as an icepick and almost as  formidable, and you have a fair idea of this feathered giant of the  ancient pampas. The head indeed was truly colossal for that of a bird,  measuring 23 inches in length by 7 in depth, while that of the racehorse  Lexington, and he was a good-sized horse, measures 22 inches long by  5-1/2 inches deep. The depth of the jaw is omitted because we wish to  make as good a case as possible for the bird, and the jaw of a horse is  so deep as to give him an undue advantage in that respect.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Skull of Phororhacos Compared with that of the  Race-horse Lexington.]    We can only speculate on the food of these great birds, and for aught we  know to the contrary they may have caught fish, fed upon carrion, or  used their powerful feet and huge beaks for grubbing roots; but if they  were not more or less carnivorous, preying upon such reptiles, mammals  and other birds as came within reach, then nature apparently made a  mistake in giving them such a formidable equipment of beak and claw. So  far as habits go we might be justified in calling them cursorial birds  of prey.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Leg of a Horse Compared with that of the Giant  Moa.]    We really know very little about these Patagonian giants, but they are  interesting not only from their great size and astounding skulls, but  because of the early age (Miocene) at which they lived and because in  spite of their bulk they are in nowise related to the ostriches, but  belong near the heron family. As usual, we have no idea why they"]]]
