The skirts were now pulled in tight to the  front of the figure and bunched up at the back, with a train or shaped  flounced pieces overlapping each other caught up under the bustle, as in  Fig. B, Plate XXXIII (see p. 282).    [Illustration: Plate XXXI.--        (_a_) Embroidered Muslin Outdoor Dress, 1855-65.      (_b_) Riding Habit. 1845-75.      (_c_) Gauze Ball Dress. 1840-55.]    [Illustration: FIG. 118.--Dress improvers, 1865-1875.]    Mantles of a cumbersome type and shot-silk capes with long pointed  fronts were worn, often heavily fringed, the former also being mostly  decorated with braided designs. Large Paisley shawls were much used all  through this reign, besides the cape and hood with its fine tassels  which became very fashionable in the sixties.    Gloves and mittens are seen both long and short, the latter often  beautifully embroidered on the back in the French style. Hand-bags were  often carried, of which examples are given in the plates of a variety of  shapes; the favourite materials for their make were velvets and silks  decorated with bullion, sequins, braids, needlework, and beads, and  these bags were richly set in gilt, silver, or steel mounts.    Parasols were still heavily fringed, and were of the usual shapes. A  very small one was carried in the carriages, and are even seen on the  ladies' driving whips.    Shoes continued in the same heelless sandal character to the sixties for  evening wear, but from the forties most outdoor shoes had a heel and  large rosettes. With the seventies came round toes with a low round  front and bow, and high shaped heels came to stay till the present day.  Boots of white satin, kid, or coloured silks were chiefly worn till the  seventies, reaching just above the ankle, laced up the inner side, but  many wore elastic sides from the fifties; the toes of these were rather  square, and a toe-cap and front seam was made in many of this type. In  the forties a tight rosette was sometimes placed low down towards the  toes, and later, a huge bow was sewn on the front. High boots buttoned  towards the side and very much shaped, with pointed round toes and high  heels were sometimes laced and finished with a pair of tassels. Spats  were always fashionable through this period.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. VICTORIA. MALE.    The same modes of doing the hair remained till the sixties, parted at  one side and worn rather long and waved, with the side whiskers or beard  all round the chin. The side whiskers were allowed to grow long between  fifty-five and seventy, and full beards also became fashionable, while  the hair was parted in the centre from front to back and flattened on  the forehead.    The favourite top-hat still reigned supreme, many of which retained the  tapered top and large curled brim till about 1855, and a bell shape was  frequently seen in the fifties, but the real straight chimney shape was  seen throughout till the eighties, with a rather narrow brim, and often  of white or fawn-coloured cloth. The bowler hat increased in  appreciation, being of a short type, with smallish brim. A short flat  felt hat, with rather straight brim, also came into favour from the  fifties; little round caps and caps with ear-flaps, for travelling, &c.,  were also in general use.    The frock-coat kept the rather tight sleeves and tight waist, and full  square skirt, with back pockets, also a deep lapel, sometimes with a  velvet collar, and small cuffs; a breast-pocket was often placed on the  left side, and in the fifties the type of morning coat with rounded-off  fronts at the skirt appeared, also a small collar and lapel. Square-cut  jackets and tweed suits similar to our present shapes, but heavier in  cut and with braided edges, were much in use. Velvet or fur-trimmed  overcoats, and heavy travelling-coats, also capes and Inverness capes,  were all in vogue.    Waistcoats became buttoned higher in the neck, and the stock-collar was  supplanted in the sixties by a turn-down collar, and small tie or loose  bow; many still affected the black stock and pointed collar to the  seventies, when a high round collar began to appear.    Coloured and fancy waistcoats were much worn till the eighties, and  evening dress was similar to the present cut, with slight differences in  the length of lapels and waistcoat front.    The trousers were made with the front flap till they were buttoned down  the front about 1845, and side pockets became general. Braids may be  noted down the sides in the fifties, and are seen now and then all  through the reign, while large plaids and stripes were highly esteemed.    Short Wellington boots were chiefly preferred up to the sixties, and  trouser-straps and spats were fashionable all through the reign. The  heavier lace-up boot came in during the fifties, and a very shaped type  of fashion appeared in the sixties.    Having now completed the general survey of Costume, the following pages  are given up to the cut and measurements of various antique garments.          PATTERNS OF VARIOUS REIGNS FROM ANTIQUE COSTUME    WITH NOTES AND MEASUREMENTS      I have striven to gather as many representative patterns of dress types  and accessories as possible, and also give many measurements from the  various examples, when I have been unable to obtain a complete pattern.  The character of cut and proportion is the essential point in the study  of dress design, and the intimate knowledge of periods. When seeing a  collection of patterns, one is astonished at the great variety in cut  used to arrive at the different bodice types. Several patterns of single  pieces are given, as it aids one to find the fellow-part; for example,  the photo of a back given in Fig. C, Plate III (see p. 55), will go with  the front cut on page 290; even though these two pieces did not belong  to the same body, the cut is seen from which to design the missing  part. Often a small piece is wanting for the top of the shoulder, which  can easily be supplied to fill the sleeve measurement. The types of  trimmings in the different centuries will soon be acquired by a careful  student, and the proportions of patterns will be valued for gaining the  character. I believe with this collection one could get the true effects  of any style of dress seen in the period prints. The drawings are mostly  scaled for the half, and the measurement, in inches, will be found by  dots on the top of the collotypes, and by a marked line on the pattern  pages.    One must note, with the 18th-century dress, the sleeve cuffs can be  changed, so I give, on page 300, a full-size measurement of the  elbow-cuff seen in Fig. A, Plate XVI (see p. 167), and a deeper one of  this style is seen on Fig. C, Plate XII (see p. 135), gathered seven  times at the elbow. The plain square type was pleated in the front as  given on page 300, and a variety of this character is shown on Fig. B,  Plate XV (see p. 154). Though many patterns may be found remarkable in  proportions, an allowance is often to be made for the undersetting, as  well as for the thick, straight corsets worn to the end of the 18th  century.    I give several specimens of quilting on petticoats of the 18th century,  which will probably be found useful to artists; the measurement is also  given of their circumference, which attained similar proportions to  those set on the Victorian crinolines, going 3 to 4 yards round: four  18th century ones measured 100, 114, 116, 120 inches, and they are often  1 inch longer at the sides, to allow for setting over the panniers; a  pattern is given on pages 213 and 332. The embroidered pockets on page  300 were worn in pairs at the sides on the petticoats, and only showed  when the dress was looped up. The extra lawn sleeves, given on page 287,  show how precious the superfine linen was held, with its superb gathered  work, lace ruffles, and often fine embroidery; these pieces could be  looked after with special care in the laundry, and could be tacked,  pinned, or buttoned on when required.    The 16th and 17th century collars were mostly attached to the chemise or  shirt, as is seen in many of the old prints. On page 289 I give examples  of shape of the various stomachers, which will be found useful for  getting the characteristic proportions. The scarves worn round the body  of the 17th century cavaliers were from 2 feet 3 inches wide to 3 feet 6  inches, and from 8 feet 6 inches to 7 feet in length.    [Illustration: Plate XXXII.--        (_a_) Silk Dress. 1860-70.            _Pattern, see p. 346._      (_b_) Gauze Walking Dress. 1850-60.      (_c_) Silk Dress. 1848-58.            _Pattern, see p. 344._]    The stocking top, Fig. C, Plate VI (see p. 74), is probably of similar  proportions to the woollen one in the Victoria and Albert Museum, on  which the bell-top circumference is 36 inches, and the full length of  stocking 38 inches. On page 285 a cap of three pieces is given; their  real design is at present unknown, but I trust the Museum authorities  may soon discover their placing, for many of these pieces are in  existence, and this set in my collection is impressed with a beautiful  pattern. The bodice, Fig A, Plate X (see p. 119), should have been set  on a stiff-fronted corset to give it the straight style, as it is  charmingly proportioned and clean in outline. I have also measured a  short circular cloak of the early 17th century, which is 34 inches in  diameter, with a square collar 10 inches deep; and another cape of the  late 16th century, 40 inches in diameter. On page 290 will be found the  smaller tabs which are placed round the jerkin, with a deep front point,  as in Fig. A, Plate VIII_a_ (see p. 103); the collar of this type often  rises 2-3/4 inches in the front to 3 inches at the back, in order to  carry the stiff ruff or deep turned-down collar.

Note its spots of pigment.    7. _Pericardial chamber_, the chamber around the heart; see Sec. 1  above.    8. _Heart._ As the fish is placed belly upward in the pan the  _ventricle_ faces you, pink, conical, and muscular. Posterior to it,  on the dorsal side, is the _auricle_, a membranous sac.    9. _Ventral aorta_, arising on the anterior surface of the ventricle  as a white muscular \"cord\" (really a tube) which is enlarged close to  the heart into a bulb, the _arterial bulb_. You should follow up this  aorta until you see it divide right and left to send its branches  outward into the gills, the branches being called _gill arteries_.          _Questions._    1. The fish frequently swallows its food alive. Why should the  stomach be muscular? Why is it better that the intestine does not  leave the stomach at the end opposite the esophagus?    2. Of what use can the coeca be? What structure of the human  intestine do you recall that is at all like them in form or use?    3. How many times the length of the body is the length of the  alimentary canal? Does this indicate that the fish is compelled to  eat a great deal of poor food or that its food is highly nutritious,  so that little need be taken?    4. Near which end of the fish's body is the heart? Is this the usual  or the unusual condition among animals you know about? What  advantages can you think of in this arrangement?    5. What advantages are there in having the heart in a chamber  separated from the other vital organs?    6. Of how many chambers does the heart consist? Why should at least  one of them be muscular?    7. How many times does the blood pass through the heart in making a  complete circuit of the body? Would you call this a single or a  double circulation?    8. Does the heart force the blood onward or does it draw blood into  itself, _i.e._ is the heart a force pump or is it a suction pump?    9. How is circulation made complete? If the heart is a force pump, is  its power sufficient to drive blood through artery, capillary, vein,  and into auricle, if the capillaries can stand the pressure, or is  another action concerned? If it is a suction pump, why does the blood  leave the heart?          _Suggested drawings._    a. The body cavity, with viscera undisturbed.    b. The alimentary canal extended.    c. The anterior end of the fish with the sinus held open, to show the  general situation of the parts.    d. The heart in its chamber, with the outgoing vessels as far as  dissected.

If individual specimens are not available, the pupil's text-book and  charts are to be used.          _Observations._    _Acorn-tongued worm_: Notice the very simple form and structure of  the symmetrical body, the \"proboscis,\" the collar surrounding the  neck with its simple rod of cartilage, the marks of internal gills  and gill slits extending some distance along the body, and the  presence or absence of sense organs. The acorn-tongued worm  (_Balanoglossus_) lives in the sand of the seashore and in shallow  water in temperate and tropical regions.    _Lancelet_: Observe the form of the body, of the fin, and of the  mouth; note the presence or absence of sense organs, and find out the  number of gills or gill slits. The lancelet (_Amphioxus_) is similar  in habit to the acorn-tongued worm. By day it lies buried with only  the mouth exposed, but at night it swims actively about. It is  somewhat more confined to the tropics.    _Lamprey_: Observe here also the primitive or unspecialized form of  the body, of the fin, of the jawless mouth, the number of gill slits,  and the sense organs.    _Shark_: Examine the body, noting its form and differentiation into  regions, its covering, its fins, mouth, gill slits, and sense organs.    _Perch_: If you have not already studied the bony fish, the points  suggested for the shark will be sufficient for this exercise.    In each case, find out the condition of the skeleton.          _Questions._    1. Which of these animals seem most simple in form, and which most  complex? Give a reason for your answer.    2. Give the stages which show how the fold of skin develops into  separate fins.    3. How does the number of gills and gill slits change in the series?  (Give definite numbers.) How may the reduction in the number of gills  be compensated for in the amount of surface exposed for the exchange  of gases in breathing?    4. How is protection afforded the delicate structure of the gills in  the final form?    5. Give the stages in the formation of a definite, symmetrical mouth  with jaws of equal size.    6. The presence of sense organs may be taken to indicate that there  is an organ of control, or brain. How is the development of this  organ like or unlike that of the other structures in the series?    7. For the developing brain and nervous system what protection and  support is afforded in each case?    The foregoing questions may be answered in tabular form by arranging  the names of the animals in a line and the questions in a column.          _Suggested drawings._    a.

STUDIES OF AMPHIBIA#    #Progress from Water-living Animals to Land-living Animals#      The Living Frog or Toad    _To show how an Animal may be adapted to both Land and Water Life_          _Materials._    Living frogs in small cages or aquaria; living toads; some pungent  liquid, as ammonia.          _Observations._    _The Body._    1. Contrast the body of the frog with that of the fish as to regions,  shape, and compactness. How do you account for the differences?    _Locomotion._    2. What kinds of locomotion can a frog use? Why is it difficult for a  frog to crawl or walk? How far can a frog jump? How are swimming and  jumping accomplished? What do you think is the use of the \"hump\" on  the back?    3. Identify in the legs the thigh, shank, ankle, foot, toes, and web,  and in the arm, the upper arm, forearm, wrist, hand, and fingers.  State in detail the differences in structure and in position between  the fore and hind limbs. How do you account for these differences?    _Feeding._    4. Induce a frog or toad to eat by dangling food, such as a piece of  raw meat or meal worms, small earthworms, etc., before it. How does  it seize the food? What will it eat? How is the mouth adapted to  this manner of feeding?    _Respiration._    5. The frog has no diaphragm, and therefore no chest cavity; watch  very carefully the movements of the mouth, the nostrils, the throat,  and the sides of the body to determine how the problem of breathing  (how the air is gotten into and out of the lungs) without a diaphragm  is solved. Write a detailed account of the frog's method of breathing  which shall explain just how the air is forced into the lungs.    6. What would be the effect of propping open the mouth of the frog?  Why? Does the frog breathe in the usual manner while under the water?  If not, how do you explain its ability to remain"]]]
