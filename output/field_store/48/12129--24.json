Greece was still rich in objects  of art of all descriptions. When, in 535, the King of Macedonia captured  the town of Thermae, in AEtolia, he found in it more than two thousand  statues.[305]    Athens, in spite of the loss of her maritime supremacy, preserved the  remains of a civilization which had already attained the highest degree  of splendour,[306] and those incomparable buildings of the age of  Pericles, the mere name of which reminds us of all that the arts have  produced in greatest perfection. Among the most remarkable were the  Acropolis, with its Parthenon and its Propylaea, masterpieces of Phidias,  the statue of Minerva in gold and ivory, and another in bronze, the  casque and spear of which were seen afar off at sea.[307] The arsenal of  the Piraeus, built by the architect Philo, was, according to Plutarch, an  admirable work.[308]    Sparta, although greatly fallen, was distinguished by its monuments and  by its manufactures; the famous portico of the Persians,[309] built  after the Median wars--the columns of which, in white marble,  represented the illustrious persons among the vanquished--was the  principal ornament of the market. Iron, obtained in abundance from Mount  Taygetus, was marvellously worked at Sparta, which was celebrated for  the manufacture of arms and agricultural instruments.[310] The coasts of  Laconia abounded in shells, from which was obtained the purple, most  valued after that of Phoenicia.[311] The port of Gytheum, very  populous, and very active in 559, still possessed great arsenals.[312]    In the centre of the peninsula, Arcadia, although its population was  composed of shepherds, had the same love for the arts as the rest of  Greece. It possessed two celebrated temples: that of Minerva at Tegaea,  built by the architect Scopas,[313] in which were united the three  orders of architecture, and that of Apollo, at Phigalea,[314] situated  at an elevation of 3,000 feet above the level of the sea, and the  remains of which still excite the wonder of travellers.    Elis, protected by its neutrality, was devoted to the arts of peace.  There agriculture flourished; its fisheries were productive; it had  manufactories of tissues of _byssus_ which rivalled the muslins of Cos,  and were sold for their weight in gold.[315] The town of Elis possessed  the finest gymnasium in Greece; people came to it to prepare themselves  (sometimes a year in advance) for competition in the Olympic games.[316]    Olympia was the holy city, celebrated for its sanctuary and its  consecrated garden, where stood, among a multitude of masterpieces of  art, one of the wonders of the world, the statue of Jupiter, the work of  Phidias,[317] the majesty of which was such, that Paulus AEmilius, when  he first saw it, believed he was in the presence of the divinity  himself.    Argos, the country of several celebrated artists, possessed temples,  fountains, a gymnasium, and a theatre; and its public place had served  for a field of battle to the armies of Pyrrhus and Antigonus. It  remained, until the subjugation by the Romans, one of the finest cities  of Greece. Within its territory were the superb temple of Juno, the  ancient sanctuary of the Argives, with the statue of the goddess in gold  and silver--the work of Polycletus, and the vale of Nemaea, where one of  the four national festivals of Greece was celebrated.[318] Argolis also  possessed Epidaurus, with its hot springs; its temple of AEsculapius,  enriched with the offerings of those who came to be cured of their  diseases;[319] and its theatre, one of the largest in the country.[320]    Corinth, admirably situated upon the narrow isthmus which separates the  AEgean Sea from the gulf which has preserved its name,[321] with its  dye-houses, its celebrated manufactories of carpets and of bronze, bore  witness also to the ancient prosperity of the Hellenic race. Its  population must have been considerable, since there were reckoned in it  460,000 slaves;[322] marble palaces rose on all sides, adorned with  statues and valuable vases. Corinth had the reputation of being the  most voluptuous of towns. Among its numerous temples, that of Venus had  in its service more than a thousand courtezans.[323] In the sale of the  booty made by Mummius, a painting by Aristides, representing Bacchus,  was sold for 600,000 sestertii.[324] There was seen in the triumph of  Metellus surnamed Macedonicus, a group, the work of Lysippus,  representing Alexander the Great, twenty-five horsemen, and nine  foot-soldiers slain at the battle of the Granicus; this group, taken at  Corinth, came from Dium in Macedonia.[325]    Other towns of Greece were no less rich in works of art.[326] The Romans  carried away from the little town of Eretria, at the time of the  Macedonian war, a great number of paintings and precious statues.[327]  We know, from the traveller Pausanias, how prodigious was the quantity  of offerings brought from the most diverse countries into the sanctuary  of Delphi. This town, which, by its reputation for sanctity and its  solemn games, the Pythian, was the rival of Olympia, gathered in its  temple during ages immense treasures; and when it was plundered by the  Phocaeans, they found in it gold and silver enough to coin ten thousand  talents of money (about 58 millions of francs [L2,320,000]). The ancient  opulence of the Greeks had, nevertheless, passed into their colonies;  and, from the extremity of the Black Sea to Cyrene, numerous  establishments arose remarkable for their sumptuousness.      [Sidenote: Macedonia.]    VIII. Macedonia drew to herself, since the time of Alexander, the riches  and resources of Asia. Dominant over a great part of Greece and Thrace,  occupying Thessaly, and extending her sovereignty over Epirus, this  kingdom concentrated in herself the vital strength of those cities  formerly independent, which, two centuries before, were her rivals in  power and courage. Under an economical administration, the public  revenues rising from the royal domains,[328] from the silver mines in  Mount Pangeum, and from the taxes, were sufficient for the wants of the  country.[329] In 527, Antigonus sent to Rhodes considerable succours,  which furnish the measure of the resources of Macedonia.[330]    Towards the year 563 of Rome, Philip had, by wise measures, raised again  the importance of Macedonia. He collected in his arsenals materials for  equipping three armies and provisions for ten years. Under Perseus,  Macedonia was no less flourishing. That prince gave Cotys, for a service  of six months with 1,000 cavalry, the large sum of 200 talents.[331] At  the battle of Pydna, which completed his ruin, nearly 20,000 men  remained on the field, and 11,000 were made prisoners.[332] In richness  of equipment, the Macedonian troops far surpassed other armies. The  Leucaspidan phalanx was dressed in scarlet, and carried gilt armour; the  Chalcaspidan phalanx had shields of the finest brass.[333] The  prodigious splendour of the court of Perseus and that of his favourites  reveal still more the degree of opulence at which Macedonia had arrived.  All exhibited in their dresses and in their feasts a pomp equal to that  of kings.[334] Among the booty made by Paulus AEmilius were paintings,  statues, rich tapestries, vases of gold, silver, bronze, and ivory,  which were so many masterpieces.[335] His triumph was unequalled by any  other.[336]    Valerius of Antium estimates at more than 120 millions of sestertii  (about 30 millions of francs [L1,200,000]) the gold and silver exhibited  on this occasion.[337] Macedonia, as we see, had absorbed the ancient  riches of Greece. Thrace, long barbarous, began also to rise out of the  condition of inferiority in which it had so long languished. Numerous  Greek colonies, founded on the shores of the Pontus Euxinus, introduced  there civilisation and prosperity; and among these colonies, Byzantium,  though often harassed by the neighbouring barbarians, had already an  importance and prosperity which presaged its future destinies.[338]  Foreigners, resorting to it from all parts, had introduced a degree of  licentiousness which became proverbial.[339] Its commerce was, above  all, nourished by the ships of Athens, which went there to fetch the  wheat of Tauris and the fish of the Euxine.[340] When Athens, in her  decline, became a prey to anarchy, Byzantium, where arts and letters  flourished, served as a refuge to her exiles.      [Sidenote: Asia Minor.]    IX. Asia Minor comprised a great number of provinces, of which several  became, after the dismemberment of the empire of Alexander, independent  states. Of these, the principal formed into four groups, composing so  many kingdoms, namely, Pontus, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Pergamus. We  must except from them some Greek cities on the coast, which kept their  autonomy or were placed under the sovereignty of Rhodes. Their extent  and limits varied often until the time of the Roman conquest, and  several of them passed from one domination to another. All these  kingdoms participated in different degrees in the prosperity of  Macedonia.    \"Asia,\" says Cicero, \"is so rich and fertile, that the fecundity of its  plains, the variety of its products, the extent of its pastures, the  multiplicity of the objects of commerce exported from it, give it an  incontestible superiority over all other countries of the earth.[341]\"    The wealth of Asia Minor appears from the amount of impositions paid by  it to the different Roman generals. Without speaking of the spoils  carried away by Scipio, in his campaign against Antiochus, and by  Manlius Volso in 565, Sylla, and afterwards Lucullus and Pompey, each  drew from this country about 20,000 talents,[342] besides an equal sum  distributed by them to their soldiers: which gives the enormous total of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#18)"],[1,", moreover, the \"Word\"  that \"was God,\" and afterwards was made flesh and dwelt among men--is  to believe in the incarnation of the Son of God, then the sacred books  of the Latter-day Saints teach this doctrine, for over and over again  in our sacred books will passages to that effect be found (especially  section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants). Moreover, the Reverend  gentleman should remember that \"Mormons\" include among their sacred  books the Holy Bible, and all the doctrine of incarnation taught in  that book is our doctrine. I think the main difference between the  Latter-day Saints and \"Christians\" on the subject of incarnation, is  that the Latter-day Saints believe that incarnation does not stop with  the Lord Jesus Christ. Our sacred books teach that not only was Jesus  Christ in the beginning with God, but that the spirits of all men were  also with him in the beginning, and that these sons of God, as well as  the Lord Jesus Christ, became incarnated in bodies of flesh and bone  (Doctrine and Covenants, section 93). But Mr. V. thinks he discovers  in this doctrine of incarnation a proof that \"God has not a body and  therefore is not an exalted man,\" \"It is plain,\" says he, \"that the Son  of God became flesh only at the time of his sojourn on earth. Now had  he been flesh or man before, as the 'Mormons' hold, how could he become  what he was already from all eternity?\" This is another instance of Mr.  V.'s misapprehension of what \"Mormons\" teach. We nowhere teach that  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was flesh and bone from all eternity.    When seeking to make \"Mormonism\" appear inconsistent with itself, the  Reverend gentleman is in duty bound to keep in mind our whole doctrine  on any particular subject he is treating. He should remember that  our theology holds that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are distinct  and separate personages, in the sense that they are three distinct  individuals; and that the Father is a personage of flesh and bone, as  Jesus now is; but previous to Messiah's birth into the world, he was a  spirit, the First Born of the hosts of the spirits in heaven, and was  with the Father in the beginning of the creation of our earth and its  heavens. Indeed, under the direction of the Father, he was the creator  of them (Heb. 1:3; Col. 15:17; John 1:3); but he came to the earth  to receive a tabernacle, that in all things he might become as his  Father is--a divine spirit inseparably united to a sacred and glorified  body--one glorious spiritual personage. As much of Mr. V.'s argument on  this head is built on a misapprehension of our doctrine, it will not  be necessary for me to follow him through the interminable windings of  his argument with reference to it. \"There is never a proper ending to  reasoning which proceeds on a false foundation\" (Cicero).    Mr. V. next brings as proof against God's being an exalted man, what he  calls the direct statement of the Bible, that God is not man: \"God is  not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should  be changed\" (Numbers 23:19). \"I am God and not man\" (Psalm). These  passages simply present the contrast between man as he is now, and with  all his imperfections on his head, and God. The Latter-day Saints do  not teach that man in his present state and condition is God; on the  contrary, they hold that there is a very, very wide difference between  them, all the difference indicated by the Bible: but they do believe  that through the eternities that will pass over man's head, and with  God for guide and teacher, he may become as his Father in heaven is,  and that such is his destiny.[A] It follows that when man shall attain  to that destiny, the contrast now so striking between man and God  will not exist. The contrast noted in the scriptures by Mr. V. is not  between _perfected_ men and God, but between very imperfect men--men  who lie, and are changeable--and God; and since the Latter-day Saints  do not hold that man while imperfect is God, or like God, or God like  him, the argument of the gentleman, based on the passages quoted,  is of no force. It could be said of some grandly developed, noble,  high-minded man, such as a Gladstone, a Bismarck, or a Washington: He  is not a child that he should halt in reason, or falter in action, or  be frightened by phantoms of the dark. But such a contrast does not  include the idea that the child may not change his status, and finally  become all that the great man is with whom he is now contrasted.  Clearly, the contrast is one of conditions, more than of natures, and  at its very highest value is the contrast between a perfected nature  and one not yet perfected.    [Footnote A: In a discourse in which much of the \"Mormon\" doctrine  concerning the Deity is unfolded by the Prophet Joseph Smith--the King  Follett discourse (see chapter 5)--in a passage dealing with the time  in which man may attain to some of the contemplated exaltations in the  future, he remarks: \"When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the  bottom and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it  is with the principles of the Gospel--you must begin with the first,  and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. _But it  will be a great while after you have passed through the vail [of death]  before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended  in this world: it will be a great work to learn our salvation and  exaltation, even beyond the grave_.\"]    The same answer applies to the Reverend gentleman's contention based  on the passage, \"Thou art always the selfsame;\" \"I am the Lord and  change not;\" \"The Father of lights, with whom there is no change  nor shadow of alteration.\" These passages teach what the Reverend  gentleman calls the \"immutability of God,\" which he holds to preclude  the idea that God rose from a state of imperfection to that of  perfection--since he is always the \"selfsame.\" Before answering at  length, I couple with this Mr. Van Der Donckt's final argument on this  division of the subject--the scriptural evidences and arguments on the  form and nature of God--namely, \"The Latter day Saints' theory of the  Man-God supposes a past and present with God. The Bible excludes that  succession of time,\" says the Reverend gentleman, \"and speaks of God  as the everlasting present; 'I Am Who am,' 'From eternity to eternity  thou art God.'\" Against this argument, based upon God's reputed  unchangeableness, and being always as he now is, from all eternity to  eternity, I wish to say, first, that the _God-nature_ is doubtless  always the same, without reference to those who may attain unto it; and  speaking of the God-nature, it is always the \"Selfsame,\" from eternity  to eternity; but after that statement, against the Reverend gentleman's  argument bottomed on God's immutability and eternity--and, in fact,  against all his arguments, from first to last, respecting the form and  nature of God, I place Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, the revelation  of God to man, I place him as my premises, and my argument against all  the reverend gentleman has said, or can say, on this division of the  subject. I call attention to the fact that neither in my discourse  which brought forth Mr. Van Der Donckt's Reply nor in this Rejoinder,  have I turned to those numerous passages of the Bible that speak of the  face, limbs or organs of God. Not that I mistrust the force of those  passages as evidence, but because I have thought it unnecessary to  appeal to them, so long as I had in Jesus, the Messiah, a full length  and complete representation of God, not only as to the _reality_ of  his being, but as to the _kind_ of being God is. And now I ask, as I  did in my discourse, _is Jesus God_? Is he a manifestation of God--a  revelation of him? If so, there must be in him an end of controversy;  for whatever Jesus Christ was and is God must be, or Jesus Christ is  no manifestation, no revelation of God. Is Jesus Christ in form like  man? Is he possessed of a body of flesh and bone which is eternally  united to him--and now an integral part of him? Does he possess body,  parts and passions? There can be but one answer to all these questions,  and that is, \"Yes; he possessed and now possesses all these things.\"  Then God also possesses them; for even according to both Catholic and  orthodox Protestant Christian doctrine, Jesus Christ was and is God,  and the complete manifestation and revelation of God the Father.    Also the specific points of argument based upon God's unchangeability,  and there being no succession of time with God--that, too, is answered  in the person and experience of Jesus Christ. According to Catholic  teaching, Jesus was a spirit, identical with God the Father in  substance, before he became man; but at a certain time he became man,  was not that a change? By it, he became something he was not before.  His humanity, according to their teaching, was _added_ to the Son of  God when he received his tabernacle of flesh and bone; and he was  certainly changed from an unembodied state to an embodied one; and  there was a \"before and after\"--in reference to this great event, in  the God Jesus' experience. Is it thinkable that this change was a  deterioration? Was the Son of God's divinity debased to the human, or  was so much of humanity as he took on raised to the divine nature, and  henceforth made an integral part of it?    The orthodox doctrine of Christianity is--Catholic and Protestant  alike--that Jesus Christ is God; that he always was and is God,  according to both orthodox theology and Christian philosophy. Yet it  is said of this Jesus that he \"_increased in wisdom and stature, and  in favor with God and man_\" (Luke 2:52). Here is certainly a change in  condition; here is succession of time with God--a before and after;  here is being and becoming; for whereas, he was a spirit, he became  man; and in becoming man, he passed through all the "]]]
