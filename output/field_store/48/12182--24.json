[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon â€” Complete (#18)"],[1," true, he makes the finest tombstones  imaginable.\"  Reassured by this information, I lay back upon my couch and  watched Habinnas' entrance with great curiosity.  Already drunk and  wearing several wreaths, his forehead smeared with perfume which ran down  into his eyes, he advanced with his hands upon his wife's shoulders, and,  seating himself in the Praetor's place, he called for wine and hot water.  Delighted with his good humor, Trimalchio called for a larger goblet for  himself, and asked him, at the same time, how he had been entertained.  \"We had everything except yourself, for my heart and soul were here, but  it was fine, it was, by Hercules.  Scissa was giving a Novendial feast  for her slave, whom she freed on his death-bed, and it's my opinion  she'll have a large sum to split with the tax gatherers, for the dead man  was rated at 50,000, but everything went off well, even if we did have to  pour half our wine on the bones of the late lamented.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SIXTH.    \"But,\" demanded Trimalchio, \"what did you have for dinner'?\"  \"I'll tell  you if I can,\" answered he, \"for my memory's so good that I often forget  my own name.  Let's see, for the first course, we had a hog, crowned with  a wine cup and garnished with cheese cakes and chicken livers cooked well  done, beets, of course, and whole-wheat bread, which I'd rather have  than white, because it puts strength into you, and when I take a crap  afterwards, I don't have to yell.  Following this, came a course of  tarts, served cold, with excellent Spanish wine poured over warm honey;  I ate several of the tarts and got the honey all over myself.  Then there  were chick-peas and lupines, all the smooth-shelled nuts you wanted, and  an apple apiece, but I got away with two, and here they are, tied up in  my napkin; for I'll have a row on my hands if I don't bring some kind of  a present home to my favorite slave.  Oh yes, my wife has just reminded  me, there was a haunch of bear-meat as a side dish, Scintilla ate some of  it without knowing what it was, and she nearly puked up her guts when she  found out.  But as for me, I ate more than a pound of it, for it tasted  exactly like wild boar and, says I, if a bear eats a man, shouldn't that  be all the more reason for a man to eat a bear?  The last course was soft  cheese, new wine boiled thick, a snail apiece, a helping of tripe, liver  pate, capped eggs, turnips and mustard.  But that's enough.  Pickled  olives were handed around in a wooden bowl, and some of the party  greedily snatched three handfuls, we had ham, too, but we sent it back.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SEVENTH.    \"But why isn't Fortunata at the table, Gaius?  Tell me.\"  \"What's that,\"  Trimalchio replied; \"don't you know her better than that?  She wouldn't  touch even a drop of water till after the silver was put away and the  leftovers divided among the slaves.\"  \"I'm going to beat it if she don't  take her place,\" Habinnas threatened, and started to get up; and then,  at a signal, the slaves all called out together \"Fortunata,\" four times  or more.    She appeared, girded round with a sash of greenish yellow, below which a  cherry-colored tunic could be seen, and she had on twisted anklets and  sandals worked in gold.  Then, wiping her hands upon a handkerchief which  she wore around her neck, she seated herself upon the couch, beside  Scintilla, Habinnas' wife, and clapping her hands and kissing her, \"My  dear,\" she gushed, \"is it really you?\"  Fortunata then removed the  bracelets from her pudgy arms and held them out to the admiring  Scintilla, and by and by she took off her anklets and even her yellow  hair-net, which was twenty-four carats fine, she would have us know!  Trimalchio, who was on the watch, ordered every trinket to be brought to  him.  \"You see these things, don't you?\"  he demanded; \"they're what  women fetter us with.  That's the way us poor suckers are done!  These  ought to weigh six pounds and a half.  I have an arm-band myself, that  don't weigh a grain under ten pounds; I bought it out of Mercury's  thousandths, too.\"  Finally, for fear he would seem to be lying, he  ordered the scales to be brought in and carried around to prove the  weights.  And Scintilla was no better.  She took off a small golden  vanity case which she wore around her neck, and which she called her  Lucky Box, and took from it two eardrops, which, in her turn, she handed  to Fortunata to be inspected.  \"Thanks to the generosity of my husband,\"  she smirked, \"no woman has better.\"  \"What's that?\"  Habinnas demanded.  \"You kept on my trail to buy that glass bean for you; if I had a  daughter, I'll be damned if I wouldn't cut off her little ears.  We'd  have everything as cheap as dirt if there were no women, but we have to  piss hot and drink cold, the way things are now.\"  The women, angry  though they were, were laughing together, in the meantime, and exchanging  drunken kisses, the one running on about her diligence as a housekeeper,  and the other about the infidelities and neglect of her husband.  Habinnas got up stealthily, while they were clinging together in this  fashion and, seizing Fortunata by the feet, he tipped her over backwards  upon the couch.  \"Let go!\"  she screeched, as her tunic slipped above her  knees; then, after pulling down her clothing, she threw herself into  Scintilla's lap, and hid, with her handkerchief, a face which was none  the more beautiful for its blushes.          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-EIGHTH.    After a short interval, Trimalchio gave orders for the dessert to be  served, whereupon the slaves took away all the tables and brought in  others, and sprinkled the floor with sawdust mixed with saffron and  vermilion, and also with powdered mica, a thing I had never seen done  before.  When all this was done Trimalchio remarked, \"I could rest  content with this course, for you have your second tables, but, if you've  something especially nice, why bring it on.\"  Meanwhile an Alexandrian  slave boy, who had been serving hot water, commenced to imitate a  nightingale, and when Trimalchio presently called out, \"Change your  tune,\" we had another surprise, for a slave, sitting at Habinnas' feet,  egged on, I have no doubt, by his own master, bawled suddenly in a  singsong voice, \"Meanwhile AEneas and all of his fleet held his course on  the billowy deep\"; never before had my ears been assailed by a sound so  discordant, for in addition to his barbarous pronunciation, and the  raising and lowering of his voice, he interpolated Atellane verses, and,  for the first time in my life, Virgil grated on my nerves.  When he had  to quit, finally, from sheer want of breath, \"Did he ever have any  training,\" Habinnas exclaimed, \"no, not he!  I educated him by sending  him among the grafters at the fair, so when it comes to taking off a  barker or a mule driver, there's not his equal, and the rogue's clever,  too, he's a shoemaker, or a cook, or a baker a regular jack of all  trades.  But he has two faults, and if he didn't have them, he'd be  beyond all price: he snores and he's been circumcised.  And that's the  reason he never can keep his mouth shut and always has an eye open.  I  paid three hundred dinars for him.\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTY-NINTH.    \"Yes,\" Scintilla broke in, \"and you've not mentioned all of his  accomplishments either; he's a pimp too, and I'm going to see that he's  branded,\" she snapped.  Trimalchio laughed.  \"There's where the  Cappadocian comes out,\" he said; \"never cheats himself out of anything  and I admire him for it, so help me Hercules, I do.  No one can show a  dead man a good time.  Don't be jealous, Scintilla; we're next to you  women, too, believe me.  As sure as you see me here safe and sound, I  used to play at thrust and parry with Mamma, my mistress, and finally  even my master got suspicious and sent me back to a stewardship; but keep  quiet, tongue, and I'll give you a cake.\"  Taking all this as praise, the  wretched slave pulled a small earthen lamp from a fold in his garment,  and impersonated a trumpeter for half an hour or more, while Habinnas  hummed with him, holding his finger pressed to his lips.  Finally, the  slave stepped out into the middle of the floor and waved his pipes in  imitation of a flute-player; then, with a whip and a smock, he enacted  the part of a mule-driver.  At last Habinnas called him over and kissed  him and said, as he poured a drink for him, \"You get better all the time,  Massa.  I'm going to give you a pair of shoes.\"  Had not the dessert been  brought in, we would never have gotten to the end of these stupidities.  Thrushes made of pastry and stuffed with nuts and raisins, quinces with  spines sticking out so that they looked like sea-urchins.  All this would  have been endurable enough had it not been for the last dish that was  served; so revolting was this, that we would rather have died of  starvation than to have even touched it.  We thought that a fat goose,  flanked with fish and all kinds of birds, had been served, until  Trimalchio spoke up.  \"Everything you see here, my friends,\" said he,  \"was made from the same stuff.\"  With my usual keen insight, I jumped to  the conclusion that I knew what that stuff was and, turning to Agamemnon,  I said, \"I shall be greatly surprised, if all those things are not made  out of excrement, or out of mud, at the very least: I saw a like artifice  practiced at Rome during the Saturnalia.\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTIETH.    I had not done speaking, when Trimalchio chimed in, \"As I hope to grow  fatter in fortune but not in figure, my cook has made all this out of a  hog!  It would be simply impossible to meet up with a more valuable  fellow: he'd make you a fish out of a sow's coynte, if that's what you  wanted, a pigeon out of her lard, a turtle-dove out of her ham, and a hen  out of a knuckle of pork: that's why I named him Daedalus, in a happy  moment.  I brought him a present of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#18)"],[1,"friends, flowers may be sent as         an expression of sympathy in either joy or         sorrow.      BIRTH, ANNOUNCEMENT OF. If wishing to send         congratulations after a birth, cards should be         left in person or sent by a messenger. Cut         flowers may be sent with the card.      BRIDE. If she wishes, a bride may present flowers         to her bridesmaids, and also to the best         man and ushers.      CHRISTENING. A christening ceremony offers a         good opportunity for the guests who desire         to present flowers to the mother. This is         not obligatory, however, and must remain a         matter of personal taste.      CONDOLENCE CALLS. When making a condolence         call upon a very intimate friend, cut         flowers may be left in person or sent,         together with a card, unless request has been         made to send none.      DEBUTANTE. Friends should send flowers to a         debutante at a formal tea given in her honor.      ENGAGEMENT. Flowers should accompany the         greetings from the parents of the man to the         parents of the woman.      FUNERALS. See FUNERALS--FLOWERS.      GROOM. He pays for the bridal bouquet carried         by the bride at the wedding ceremony, and, if         he wishes, for the bouquets carried by the         bridesmaids.      MEN. If well acquainted with a debutante's         family, a man may send her flowers at the         time of her debut.           After a slightly intimate acquaintance, a         man can present flowers to a young         unmarried woman as a token of sympathy either of         joy or sorrow.           It is not usual for a man to send flowers to         a woman who is a mere acquaintance.      BALLS. It is permissible for a man, if he wishes,         to send flowers to a woman he is to escort to         a ball.      THEATRE OR OPERA. It is permissible, but not         necessary, for a man to send flowers to the         woman he is to take to the theatre or to the         opera.      WEDDING TRIP. The best man should arrange         beforehand all the details of the trip--such as         the tickets, parlor-car, flowers, baggage, etc.      PALL-BEARERS. See PALL-BEARERS--FLOWERS.        FORK AND KNIFE. See KNIFE AND FORK.        FORMAL AFTERNOON TEAS. See AFTERNOON TEAS (FORMAL).    FORMAL DANCES. See DANCES (FORMAL).        FRUIT. All raw fruit, except melons, berries, and         grapefruit, are eaten with the fingers.         Canned fruits are eaten with a spoon.        FULL DRESS. This phrase is now no longer in good         usage, and instead should be used the term:         \"Evening Dress,\" which SEE.        FUNERALS. A member of the family, or very near         relative, should take charge of the ceremony         and direct the undertaker. A large funeral         should be avoided, and the ceremony confined         to the immediate family and nearest relatives,         and, if possible, the service should be at the         church.           All the details of the funeral should be         carefully considered and carried out, with the         ceremony started at the hour set, and with         all appearance of confusion avoided.           It is not now customary to watch by the         dead at night.           Funerals should be private, and only those         intimately interested should be invited.      CARRIAGES. A carriage should always be         provided to call for the clergyman and to take         him from the church or cemetery back to his         house. Carriages should also be provided to         take the friends, mourners, and pall-bearers         from the house to the church, and then to the         cemetery and return. These are provided by         the family.      DRESS. See FUNERALS--MEN.      EXPENSES. Though it is not customary for         the clergyman in Protestant churches to         expect or to receive fees for conducting funerals,         yet it is in perfectly good taste to offer him a         fee. In the Roman Catholic Church the rate         of fees for funerals is fixed. There are,         besides, fees for the sexton, the organist, and the         singers.      FLOWERS. The family, in publishing notice of         funeral, may add: \"Kindly omit flowers.\"         However, in the absence of such a notice,         at the public funerals of prominent persons         elaborate designs may be sent. But at a         private funeral, if flowers are sent, they         should be choice and delicate.           The custom is growing of having fewer         flowers, and it is no longer in good taste to         have a carriage in the procession carrying         flowers and set pieces. A good use of the         large set pieces is to send them afterward to         the hospitals.           If any flowers are laid upon the grave         they should be those given by the nearest         relatives.      INVITATIONS. A church funeral can be attended         by any one, friend or acquaintance, and no         slight should be felt at the non-receipt of an         invitation. Those attending should take         especial pains to be in the church before the         funeral procession arrives, and that they do         nothing to distract from the solemnity of the         occasion.           Notice of death and date of funeral may be         printed on heavy bordered cards, or on         mourning paper, and sent to friends.         Sometimes a notice is written and sent to most         intimate friends.      MEN--DRESS. A man should wear either a black         frock coat or a black cutaway, with the         necktie, gloves, and other parts of the dress as         subdued as possible. Under no conditions         should light ties or light-colored linen be         worn.      PALL-BEARERS. See PALL-BEARERS.      PRECEDENCE. At a church funeral the parents,         arm in arm, follow the body of their child,         and the children come next in the order of         their age.           A widow, leaning on the arm of her eldest         son, follows the body of her husband, and         the other children come after.           A widower, attended by his eldest daughter         or son, follows the body of his wife, and the         children come after.           The elder children always precede the         younger. The pall-bearers are seated at the         left of the main isle, and the near relatives         at the right.      PUBLIC NOTICE. When the date of the funeral         has been determined upon, notice should be         published in the papers, giving date, place,         and time of funeral--also date of birth and         late place of residence of deceased. Such         announcement may contain notice that         the interment is private, and also the words:         \"Kindly omit flowers.\"           A notice of death and date of funeral may         be printed on heavy bordered cards or mourning         paper, and sent to friends. Sometimes         a notice is written and sent to most intimate         friends.      CHURCH. The pall-bearers and the nearest relatives         meet at the house. At the appointed         hour the procession leaves the house, the         casket borne on the shoulders of the undertaker's         assistants, followed by the pall-bearers,         relatives, and friends.           The same order is followed in the procession         up the aisle, the relatives occupying         the first pews on the right, the pall-bearers         the first pews on the left, of the middle aisle.         At the conclusion of the ceremony the friends         wait until the family and pall-bearers have         left, and then quietly retire.      HOUSE. At a house funeral, some one representing         the family should receive the people         as they enter and direct them where to go,         it being customary for the family and relatives         to be in one room and the friends in         another.           Usually there are no pall-bearers; but if         there are, their duties are the same as at a         church funeral. The clergyman should stand         near the casket, and if there are musicians         they should be so stationed that, while they         are not seen, they are easily heard. At the         conclusion of the ceremony the friends depart,         and thus allow the family and relatives         to take the last leave of the deceased         before they take the carriages for the cemetery.           It is customary for the family to be in         retirement at the hour of the funeral, and         they are the first to enter the carriages.           Those in charge of the house should, after         the funeral party has left, arrange the         apartments to make them as cheerful as possible,         and also provide a substantial meal for         the mourners on their return.        GARDEN PARTIES.      CARDS. Guests leave their cards in the hall either           when entering or leaving only at large garden           parties.      DRESS. It is customary for women to wear light           afternoon dresses.             Men wear summer business suits, yachting           flannels, and straw hats, and even white duck           trousers. Gloves are not worn.             The regulation frock coat and high hat is           not worn, save by men from the city or at           some extremely fashionable affair.      GUESTS. After leaving their outer garments in         the dressing-rooms, the guests should pay         their respects to the hostess, after which         they are free to enjoy themselves as they         please.           The usual length of stay is about half an         hour or the whole afternoon.           While guests may arrive at their own convenient         time, they would do well to remember         that they have not the same freedom to come         and go as at an afternoon reception.           Guests should take leave of the hostess"]]]
