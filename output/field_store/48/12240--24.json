Lincoln and Harrison could not have been altogether penniless, for at  Peoria they bought a canoe and paddled down to Pekin. Here the  ingenious Lincoln employed his hereditary talent for carpentry by  making an oar for the frail vessel while Harrison was providing the  commissary stores. The latter goes on to say: \"The river, being very  low, was without current, so that we had to pull hard to make half the  speed of legs on land; in fact, we let her float all night, and on the  next morning always found the objects still visible that were beside  us the previous evening. The water was remarkably clear for this river  of plants, and the fish appeared to be sporting with us as we moved  over or near them. On the next day after we left Pekin we overhauled a  raft of saw-logs, with two men afloat on it to urge it on with poles  and to guide it in the channel. We immediately pulled up to them and  went on the raft, where we were made welcome by various  demonstrations, especially by an invitation to a feast on fish, corn-  bread, eggs, butter, and coffee, just prepared for our benefit. Of  these good things we ate almost immoderately, for it was the only warm  meal we had made for several days. While preparing it, and after  dinner, Lincoln entertained them, and they entertained us for a couple  of hours very amusingly.\" Kindly human companionship was a luxury in  that green wilderness, and was readily appreciated and paid for.    The returning warriors dropped down the river to the village of  Havana--from Pekin to Havana in a canoe! The country is full of these  geographical nightmares, the necessary result of freedom of  nomenclature bestowed by circumstances upon minds equally destitute of  taste or education. There they sold their boat,--no difficult task,  for a canoe was a staple article in any river-town,--and again set out  \"the old way, over the sand-ridges, for Petersburg. As we drew near  home, the impulse became stronger and urged us on amazingly. The long  strides of Lincoln, often slipping back in the loose sand six inches  every step, were just right for me; and he was greatly diverted when  he noticed me behind him stepping along in his tracks to keep from  slipping.\" Thus the two comrades came back from their soldierings to  their humble homes, from which Lincoln was soon to start on the way  marked out for him by Providence, with strides which no comrade, with  whatever goodwill, might hope to follow.    He never took his campaigning seriously. The politician's habit of  glorifying the petty incidents of a candidate's life always seemed  absurd to him, and in his speech, made in 1848, ridiculing the effort  on the part of General Cass's friends to draw some political advantage  from that gentleman's respectable but obscure services on the frontier  in the war with Great Britain, he stopped any future eulogist from  painting his own military achievements in too lively colors. \"Did you  know, Mr. Speaker,\" he said, \"I am a military hero! In the days of the  Black Hawk war I fought, bled, and came away. I was not at Stillman's  defeat, but I was about as near it as General Cass was to Hull's  surrender; and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards. It is  quite certain I did not break my sword, for I had none to break, but I  bent my musket pretty badly on one occasion. If General Cass went in  advance of me picking whortleberries, I guess I surpassed him in  charges on the wild onions. If he saw any live fighting Indians, it  was more than I did, but I had a good many bloody struggles with the  mosquitoes; and although I never fainted from loss of blood, I can  truly say I was often very hungry. If ever I should conclude to doff  whatever our Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade  Federalism about me, and thereupon they shall take me up as their  candidate for the Presidency, I protest that they shall not make fun  of me, as they have of General Cass, by attempting to write me into a  military hero.\"    [Relocated Footnote: A story to the effect that Lincoln was mustered  into service by Jefferson Davis has for a long time been current, but  the strictest search in the records fails to confirm it. We are  indebted to General R. C. Drum, Adjutant-General of the Army, for an  interesting letter giving all the known facts in relation to this  story. General Drum says: \"The company of the Fourth Regiment Illinois  Mounted Volunteers, commanded by Mr. Lincoln, was, with others, called  out by Governor Reynolds, and was organized at Richland, Sangamon  County, Illinois, April 21, 1832. The muster-in roll is not on file,  but the records show that the company was mustered out at the mouth of  Fox River, May 27, 1832, by Nathaniel Buckmaster, Brigade-Major to  General Samuel Whitesides's Illinois Volunteers. On the muster-roll of  Captain Elijah Iles's company, Illinois Mounted Volunteers, A. Lincoln  (Sangamon County) appears as a private from May 27, 1832, to June 16,  1832, when the company was mustered out of service by Lieutenant  Robert Anderson, Third United States Artillery and Colonel (Assistant  Inspector-General) Illinois Volunteers. Brigadier-General Henry  Atkinson, in his report of May 30, 1832, stated that the Illinois  Volunteers were called out by the Governor of that State, but in haste  and for no definite period of service. On their arrival at Ottawa they  became clamorous for their discharge, which the Governor granted,  retaining--of those who were discharged and volunteered for a further  period of twenty days--a sufficient number of men to form six  companies, which General Atkinson found at Ottawa on his arrival there  from Rock River. General Atkinson further reports that these companies  and some three hundred regular troops, remaining in position at Rock  River, were all the force left him to keep the enemy in check until  the assemblage of the three thousand additional Illinois militia  called out by the Governor upon his (General A.'s) requisition, to  rendezvous at Ottawa, June 12-15, 1832,    \"There can be no doubt that Captain Iles's company, mentioned above,  was one of the six which served until June 16, 1832, while the fact is  fully established that the company of which Mr. Lincoln was a member  was mustered out by Lieutenant Robert Anderson, who, in April, 1861,  was in command of Fort Sumter. There is no evidence to show that it  was mustered in by Lieutenant Jefferson Davis. Mr. Davis's company (B,  First United States Infantry) was stationed at Fort Crawford,  Wisconsin, during the months of January and February, 1832, and he is  borne on the rolls as 'absent on detached service at the Dubuque mines  by order of Colonel Morgan.' From March 26 to August 18, 1832, the  muster-rolls of his company report him as absent on furlough.\"]          CHAPTER VI    SURVEYOR AND REPRESENTATIVE      [Sidenote: 1832.]    The discharged volunteer arrived in New Salem only ten days before the  August election, in which he had a deep personal interest. Before  starting for the wars he had announced himself, according to the  custom of the time, by a handbill circular, as a candidate for the  Legislature from Sangamon County. [Footnote: We are aware that all  former biographers have stated that Lincoln's candidacy for the  Legislature was subsequent to his return from the war, and a  consequence of his service. But his circular is dated March 9, 1832,  and the \"Sangamo Journal\" mentions his name among the July, and  apologizes candidates in for having accidentally omitted it in May.]  He had done this in accordance with his own natural bent for public  life and desire for usefulness and distinction, and not without strong  encouragement from friends whose opinion he valued. He had even then  considerable experience in speaking and thinking on his feet. He had  begun his practice in that direction before leaving Indiana, and  continued it everywhere he had gone. Mr. William Butler tells us that  on one occasion, when Lincoln was a farmhand at Island Grove, the  famous circuit-rider, Peter Cartwright, came by, electioneering for  the Legislature, and Lincoln at once engaged in a discussion with him  in the cornfield, in which the great Methodist was equally astonished  at the close reasoning and the uncouth figure of Mr. Brown's  extraordinary hired man. At another time, after one Posey, a  politician in search of office, had made a speech in Macon, John  Hanks, whose admiration of his cousin's oratory was unbounded, said  that \"Abe could beat it.\" He turned a keg on end, and the tall boy  mounted it and made his speech. \"The subject was the navigation of the  Sangamon, and Abe beat him to death,\" says the loyal Hanks. So it was  not with the tremor of a complete novice that the young man took the  stump during the few days left him between his return and the  election.    [Sidenote: Reynolds, \"My Own Times,\" p. 291.]    He ran as a Whig. As this has been denied on authority which is  generally trustworthy, it is well enough to insist upon the fact. We  have a memorandum in Mr. Lincoln's own handwriting in which he says he  ran as \"an avowed Clay man.\" In one of the few speeches of his, which,  made at this time, have been remembered and reported, he said: \"I am  in favor of a national bank; I am in favor of the internal improvement  system, and of a high protective tariff. These are my sentiments and  political principles.\" Nothing could be more unqualified or outspoken  than this announcement of his adhesion to what was then and for years  afterwards called \"the American System\" of Henry Clay. Other testimony  is not wanting to the same effect. Both Major Stuart and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#18)"],[1," has his price. Snuff's  price was half a pound of tea; and the crew came back, bringing,  however, several new modifications in our contract.    Taking no account of several individuals that joined a number of  times but finally resigned, the following, after they had received  presents, provisions, and advance pay, were the crew secured to  man the York boat on the \"3 or 4\" days' run to Pike's Portage and  then carry my goods to the first lake.    Weeso. The Jesuits called him Louison d'Noire, but it has been  corrupted into a simpler form. \"Weeso\" they call it, \"Weeso\" they  write it, and for \"Weeso\" you must ask, or you will not find him.  So I write it as I do \"Sousi\" and \"Yum,\" with the true local colour.    He was a nice, kind, simple old rabbit, not much use and not  over-strong, but he did his best, never murmuring, and in all the  mutinies and rebellions that followed he remained staunch, saying  simply, \"I gave my word I would go, and I will go.\" He would make  a safe guide for the next party headed for Aylmer Lake. He alone  did not ask rations for his wife during his absence; he said, \"It  didn't matter about her, as they had been married for a long time  now.\" He asked as presents a pair of my spectacles, as his eyes  were failing, and a marble axe. The latter I sent him later, but  he could not understand why glasses that helped me should not help  him. He acted as pilot and guide, knowing next to nothing about  either.    Francois d'Noire, son of Weeso, a quiet, steady, inoffensive chap,  but not strong; nevertheless, having been there once with us, he  is now a competent guide to take any other party as far as Pike's  Portage.    C., a sulky brute and a mischief-maker. He joined and resigned  a dozen times that day, coming back on each occasion with a new  demand.    S., grandson of the chief, a sulky good-for-nothing; would not have  him again at any price; besides the usual wages, tobacco, food,  etc., he demanded extra to support his wife during his absence.  The wife, I found, was a myth.    T., a sulky good-for-nothing.    Beaulieu, an alleged grandson of his grandfather. A perpetual  breeder of trouble; never did a decent day's work the whole trip.  Insolent, mutinous, and overbearing, till I went for him with intent  to do bodily mischief; then he became extremely obsequious. Like  the rest of the foregoing, he resigned and resumed at irregular  intervals.    Yum (William), Freesay; the best of the lot; a bright, cheerful,  intelligent, strong Indian, boy. He and my old standby, Billy  Loutit, did virtually all the handling of that big boat. Any one  travelling in that country should secure Yum if they can. He was  worth all the others put together.          CHAPTER XXII    THE CHIPEWYANS, THEIR SPEECH AND WRITING        Sweeping generalisations are always misleading, therefore I offer  some now, and later will correct them by specific instances.    These Chipewyans are dirty, shiftless, improvident, and absolutely  honest. Of the last we saw daily instances in crossing the country.  Valuables hung in trees, protected only from weather, birds, and  beasts, but never a suggestion that they needed protection from  mankind. They are kind and hospitable among themselves, but grasping  in their dealings with white men, as already set forth. While they  are shiftless and lazy, they also undertake the frightful toil of  hunting and portaging. Although improvident, they have learned to  dry a stock of meat and put up a scaffold of white fish for winter  use. As a tribe they are mild and inoffensive, although they are  the original stock from which the Apaches broke away some hundreds  of years ago before settling in the south.    They have suffered greatly from diseases imported by white men,  but not from whiskey. The Hudson's Bay Company has always refused  to supply liquor to the natives. What little of the evil traffic  there has been was the work of free-traders. But the Royal Mounted  Police have most rigorously and effectually suppressed this.  Nevertheless, Chief Trader Anderson tells me that the Mackenzie  Valley tribes have fallen to less than half their numbers during  the last century.    It is about ten, years since they made the treaty that surrendered  their lands to the government. They have no reserves, but are free  to hunt as their fathers did.    I found several of the older men lamenting the degeneracy of  their people. \"Our fathers were hunters and our mothers made good  moccasins, but the young men are lazy loafers around the trading  posts, and the women get money in bad ways to buy what they should  make with their hands.\"    The Chipewyan dialects are peculiarly rasping, clicking, and  guttural, especially when compared with Cree.    Every man and woman and most of the children among them smoke.  They habitually appear with a pipe in their mouth and speak without  removing it, so that the words gurgle out on each side of the pipe  while a thin stream goes sizzling through the stem. This additional  variant makes it hopeless to suggest on paper any approach to their  peculiar speech.    The Jesuits tell me that it was more clicked and guttural fifty  years ago, but that they are successfully weeding out many of the  more unpleasant catarrhal sounds.    In noting down the names of animals, I was struck by the fact that  the more familiar the animal the shorter its name. Thus the Beaver,  Muskrat, Rabbit, and Marten, on which they live, are respectively  Tsa, Dthen, Ka, and Tha. The less familiar (in a daily sense) Red  Fox and Weasel are Nak-ee-they, Noon-dee-a, Tel-ky-lay; and the  comparatively scarce Musk-ox and little Weasel, At-huh-le-jer-ray  and Tel-ky-lay-azzy. All of which is clear and logical, for the  name originally is a description, but the softer parts and sharp  angles are worn down by the attrition of use--the more use they  have for a word the shorter it is bound to get. In this connection  it is significant that \"to-day\" is To-ho-chin-nay, and \"to-morrow\"  Kom-pay.    The Chipewyan teepee is very distinctive; fifty years ago all were  of caribou leather, now most are of cotton; not for lack of caribou,  but because the cotton does not need continual watching to save it  from the dogs. Of the fifty teepees at Fort Chipewyan, one or two  only were of caribou but many had caribou-skin tops, as these are  less likely to bum than those of cotton.    The way they manage the smoke is very clever; instead of the two  fixed flaps, as among the Plains River Indians, these have a separate  hood which is easily set on any side (see III). Chief Squirrel lives  in a lodge that is an admirable combination of the white men's tent  with its weather-proof roof and the Indian teepee with its cosy  fire. (See cut, p. 149.)    Not one of these lodges that I saw, here or elsewhere, had the  slightest suggestion of decoration.    For people who spend their whole life on or near the water these are  the worst boatmen I ever saw. The narrow, thick paddle they make,  compared with the broad, thin Iroquois paddle, exactly expressed  the difference between the two as canoemen. The Chipewyan's mode of  using it is to sit near the middle and make 2 or perhaps 3 strokes  on one side, then change to the other side for the same, and so  on. The line made by the canoes is an endless zigzag. The idea of  paddling on one side so dexterously that the canoe goes straight  is yet on an evolutionary pinnacle beyond their present horizon.    In rowing, their way is to stand up, reach forward with the 30-pound  16 1/2-foot oar, throw all the weight on it, falling backward into  the seat. After half an hour of this exhausting work they must rest  15 to 20 minutes. The long, steady, strong pull is unknown to them  in every sense.    Their ideas of sailing a boat are childish. Tacking is like washing,  merely a dim possibility of their very distant future. It's a  sailing wind if behind; otherwise it's a case of furl and row.    By an ancient, unwritten law the whole country is roughly divided  among the hunters. Each has his own recognised hunting ground,  usually a given river valley, that is his exclusive and hereditary  property; another hunter may follow a wounded animal into it, but  not begin a hunt there or set a trap upon it.    Most of their time is spent at the village, but the hunting ground  is visited at proper seasons.    Fifty years ago they commonly went half naked. How they stood the  insects I do not know, and when asked they merely grinned significantly;  probably they doped themselves with grease.    This religious training has had one bad effect. Inspired with horror  of being \"naked\" savages, they do not run any sinful risks, even  to take a bath. In all the six months I was among them I never saw  an Indian's bare arms, much less his legs. One day after the fly  season was over I took advantage of the lovely weather and water  to strip off and jump into a lake by our camp;  my Indians modestly  turned their backs until I had finished.    If this mock modesty worked for morality one might well accept it,  but the old folks say that it operates quite the other way. It has  at all events put an end to any possibility of them taking a bath.    Maybe as a consequence, but of this I am not sure, none of these  Indians swim. A large canoe-load upset in crossing Great Slave Lake  a month after we arrived and all were drowned.    Like most men who lead physical lives, and like all meat-eating  savages, these are possessed of a natural proneness toward strong  drink.    An interesting two-edged boomerang illustration of this was given  by an unscrupulous whiskey trader. While travelling across country  he ran short of provisions but fortunately came to a Chipewyan  lodge. At first its owner had no meat to spare, but when he found  that the visitor had a flask of whiskey he offered for it a large  piece of Moose meat; when this was refused he doubled the amount,  and after another"]]]
