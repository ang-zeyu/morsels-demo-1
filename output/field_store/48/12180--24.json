Rather, under public forum doctrine,  the extent to which the First Amendment permits the government to  restrict speech on its own property depends on the character of  the forum that the government has created.  See Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788 (1985).  Thus,  the First Amendment affords greater deference to restrictions on  speech in those areas considered less amenable to free  expression, such as military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S.  828 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39  (1966), or public airport terminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672 (1992), than to  restrictions on speech in state universities, see Rosenberger v.  Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), or  streets, sidewalks and public parks, see Frisby v. Schultz, 487  U.S. 474 (1988); Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939).  The Supreme Court has identified three types of fora for  purposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny  applicable to content-based restrictions on speech on government  property: traditional public fora, designated public fora, and  nonpublic fora.  Traditional public fora include sidewalks,  squares, and public parks:  [S]treets and parks . . . have immemorially been held  in trust for the use of the public and, time out of  mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,  communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing  public questions.  Such use of the streets and public  places has, from ancient times, been a part of the  privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of  citizens.      Hague, 307 U.S. at 515.  \"In these quintessential public forums,  . . . [f]or the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it  must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling  state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that  end.\"  Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S.  37, 45 (1983); see also Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,  505 U.S. at 678 (\"[R]egulation of speech on government property  that has traditionally been available for public expression is  subject to the highest scrutiny.\"); Frisby, 487 U.S. at 480  (\"[W]e have repeatedly referred to public streets as the  archetype of a traditional public forum.\").  A second category of fora, known as designated (or limited)  public fora, \"consists of public property which the State has  opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity.\"   Perry, 460 U.S. at 46.  Whereas any content-based restriction on  the use of traditional public fora is subject to strict scrutiny,  the state is generally permitted, as long as it does not  discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, to limit a designated  public forum to certain speakers or the discussion of certain  subjects.  See Perry, 460 U.S. at 45 n.7.  Once it has defined  the limits of a designated public forum, however, \"[r]egulation  of such property is subject to the same limitations as that  governing a traditional public forum.\"  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna  Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 678.  Examples of designated fora  include university meeting facilities, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454  U.S. 263 (1981), school board meetings, see City of Madison Joint  School Dist. v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167  (1976), and municipal theaters, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd.  v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975).      The third category, nonpublic fora, consists of all  remaining public property.  \"Limitations on expressive activity  conducted on this last category of property must survive only a  much more limited review.  The challenged regulation need only be  reasonable, as long as the regulation is not an effort to  suppress the speaker's activity due to disagreement with the  speaker's view.\"  Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S.  at 679.  2.        Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's  Collection as a Whole or the Provision of Internet  Access?    To apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must first  determine whether the appropriate forum for analysis is the  library's collection as a whole, which includes both print and  electronic resources, or the library's provision of Internet  access.  Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for expressive  purposes, to governmentally controlled property, the Supreme  Court has held that the relevant forum is defined not by the  physical limits of the government property at issue, but rather  by the specific access that the plaintiff seeks:  Although . . . as an initial matter a speaker must seek  access to public property or to private property  dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment  concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by  identifying the government property at issue.  Rather,  in defining the forum we have focused on the access  sought by the speaker.  When speakers seek general  access to public property, the forum encompasses that  property.  In cases in which limited access is sought,  our cases have taken a more tailored approach to  ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the  confines of the government property.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788,  801 (1985).      Thus, in Cornelius, where the plaintiffs were legal defense  and political advocacy groups seeking to participate in the  Combined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that the  relevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entire  federal workplace, but rather the charity drive itself.  Id. at  801.  Similarly, in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local  Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), which addressed a  union's right to access a public school's internal mail system  and teachers' mailboxes, the Court identified the relevant forum  as the school's mail system, not the public school as a whole.  In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), in which a student  group challenged a state university's restrictions on use of its  meeting facilities, the Court identified the relevant forum as  the meeting facilities to which the plaintiffs sought access, not  the state university generally.  And in Christ's Bride  Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA, 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), involving  a First Amendment challenge to the removal of advertisements from  subway and commuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted that  the forum at issue was not the rail and subway stations as a  whole, but rather the advertising space within the stations.  Id.  at 248.  Although these cases dealt with the problem of  identifying the relevant forum where speakers are claiming a  right of access, we believe that the same approach applies to  identifying the relevant forum where the parties seeking access  are listeners or readers.      In this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a  First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire  certain books or magazines for their print collections.  Nor are  the Web site plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to  compel public libraries to carry print materials that they  publish.  Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific  right of library patrons to access information on the Internet,  and the specific right of Web publishers to provide library  patrons with information via the Internet.  Thus, the relevant  forum for analysis is not the library's entire collection, which  includes both print and electronic media, such as the Internet,  but rather the specific forum created when the library provides  its patrons with Internet access.  Although a public library's provision of Internet access  does not resemble the conventional notion of a forum as a well-  defined physical space, the same First Amendment standards apply.   See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S.  819, 830 (1995) (holding that a state university's student  activities fund \"is a forum more in a metaphysical than a spatial  or geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable\");  see also Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801 (identifying the Combined  Federal Campaign charity drive as the relevant unit of analysis  for application of public forum doctrine).  3.        Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora      Unlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals, see Int'l  Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672  (1992), military bases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976),  jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39 (1966), the  federal workplace, see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ.  Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 805 (1985), and public transit vehicles, see  Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974), the  purpose of a public library in general, and the provision of  Internet access within a public library in particular, is \"for  use by the public . . . for expressive activity,\" Perry Educ.  Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983),  namely, the dissemination and receipt by the public of a wide  range of information.  We are satisfied that when the government  provides Internet access in a public library, it has created a  designated public forum.  See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of  Trustees of the Loudoun County Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563  (E.D. Va. 1998); cf. Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242,  1259 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that a public library is a limited  public forum).  Relying on those cases that have recognized that government  has leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use of a  designated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and that  content-based restrictions on speech that are consistent with  those purposes are subject only to rational basis review, the  government argues for application of rational basis review to  public libraries' decisions about which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#18)"],[1,"the F.B.I.\"    \"I can't advise you on the subject of your sex life,\" Vail said. \"But  you have nothing to fear if you remember to cultivate a clean-cut manly  expression and an air of amazed innocence as you tell the Judge, 'Not  guilty, your Honor, and I reserve my defense.'\"    \"What shall I tell Phil Cone, though?\" I asked.    \"Wait a minute and I'll put in another call,\" Vail said. He dialed  another number. \"I want to speak to Joe,\" he said. \"Yes. Joe. Tell him  it's Merry Vail.... Joe, this is Merry.... Same to you. Say, what's all  this b.s. about Winnie Tompkins.... Oh ... the hell you say!... I don't  believe.... No, that's definitely not true.... If it was anybody but  you, Joe, I'd advise him to sue for libel.... Yeah, he's my client....  Of course he's innocent.... Lay you five-to-one in thousands he is....  Done!\"    Vail turned back to me. \"That was the chief fixer in New York,\" he  told me. \"His word is good. This kidnapping charge is a phony. Just  a move to tie you up. What they think they have on you is a charge  under the Espionage Act, communicating with the enemy. Joe was vague  but it sounded plenty tough. The S.E.C.'s passed out word to be cagey  in trading with you. They can't black-list you or freeze your funds  without a hearing, but they sure can put on the heat. How much did  Willamer want you to put into his racket?\"    \"Half a million,\" I told him. \"One hundred thousand now and the rest in  thirty days.\"    Merry Vail drew a wry face, sucked in his lips and signaled to Tammy  for another drink. \"As a member of the Bar and an officer of the  court,\" he remarked, \"I can't advise you to pay blackmail. On the other  hand, if you could see your way to making a substantial investment in  the Inter-Alia Corporation, it might make things much pleasanter all  around.\"    I shook my head. \"No, Merry,\" I told him, \"and you are through as my  attorney. I'll take my chances without a lawyer from now on, if that's  the sort of advice I pay you for. I don't mind a gamble but these boys  figure to use malaria to put a financial squeeze on the whole world.  Ever see a man die of malignant malaria, Merry? It's not nice and it's  not necessary, if you have atabrine or quinine. No, damn it, you go  peddle your papers and I'll fight this out alone. Tammy,\" I added. \"Get  me the office, please. I want to talk to Mr. Cone again.\"    Vail grinned and clapped me on the shoulder. \"Like hell you'll do  without an attorney, you damn fool!\" he said. \"I'm sticking with you,  with or without a fee. Say,\" he added, \"what's come into you to make  you act this way? You used to get the heebie-jeebies at the mere  thought of legal complications.\"    \"Phil,\" I said into the phone. \"This is Winnie. Things are plenty bad  for me personally. You and Graham can pull right out now if you wish.  That louse Harry Willamer or somebody has put me on the spot and I'm  trying to prove I'm not a Nazi agent.... No, neither are you, but you  might have a hell of a time proving it. That's swell of you, Phil, but  I don't want to get you or Graham in trouble. Now's the time to pull  out of the firm if you like. Naturally I'm innocent but just now it's  tough. Okay, you take it up with Graham, will you? I don't want to have  to worry about either of you.... Sure I'm in a jam but it's not your  fault and has nothing to do with the firm....\"    When I put the telephone back in its cradle I looked up to see Merry  Vail staring at me.    \"Winnie,\" he said, \"you're innocent for my money. Fun's fun but this  thing is dangerous. Now I'm your attorney and you'll sure as hell need  one so it's no use firing me. I don't know what sort of a frame they've  figured for you or why the F.B.I.--\"    I laughed. \"Okay, Merry,\" I told him, \"you're still my attorney. The  F.B.I.'s been swell. The Special Agent assigned to check up on me, A.  J. Harcourt, couldn't be nicer. I'd trust him not to pull a fast one.\"    Vail frowned. \"The F.B.I. may be swell,\" he answered, \"but their hand  can be forced. They have to act on information received and superior  orders. Your man Harcourt may be the nicest guy in the world but if  he's told to bring you in he'll bring you in.\"    \"Then what's your advice, counselor?\"    \"My advice to you, Winnie,\" he said, \"is to try to forget about it.  Just go right ahead with your plans, whatever they are, just so you  don't try to leave this jurisdiction or go into hiding. The best thing  you could do is to go back to Bedford Hills and mind your own business  and don't let these government so-and-so's push you around. Hell, this  is a free country!\"    \"But I phoned Jimmie to meet me at the Ritz at five o'clock,\" I  objected, \"with our traveling things.\"    Vail glanced at his wrist-watch. \"It's not three yet. If you phone her  now the chances are she hasn't left. Tell her to stay put. Remember,  the less you act guilty or scared the safer you are. The dog doesn't  start to chase the rabbit until the rabbit starts to run.\"    I phoned back to Pook's Hill and was rewarded by catching Jimmie five  minutes before the taxi was due to pick her up.    \"Hold everything, dear,\" I told her. \"Plans have changed. I'm coming  out on the first train I can catch. How's Ponto?\"    \"Thank Heaven you called,\" Winnie's wife replied. \"I couldn't find your  dressing gown and your traveling case is in the room with Ponto and I  didn't want to disturb him.... Oh he's snoring like mad. Passed out  cold, I guess. He shakes the house. I never knew dogs got drunk, did  you?\"           *       *       *       *       *    When I first arrived at Pook's Hill I had a definite program in mind.  First, I went to the kitchen, broke a raw egg into a tumbler and soused  it in Worchester sauce. Then I added a good slug of brandy from the  portable bar in my den. Armed with this Prairie Oyster, I went boldly  to the second floor, opened the door to my bedroom and contemplated the  debauched Great Dane.    Really, I could never have believed that a dog could look so completely  blotto. Ponto was a bum in every sense of the word. He lay drooling and  snoring on the bed, dead to the world.    \"Ponto!\" I ordered.    An ear pricked up, then dropped languidly back again. Then a blood-shot  eye opened and shut. There was a half-whine, half snarl, interrupted by  a violent hiccough.    \"Here you are, Ponto!\" I stated firmly, advancing on the bed, glass in  hand.    The blood-shot eye opened again and the beast began to shake and  shiver. I walked up, lifted his jowl in one hand, made a little funnel  of his lip and poured in the Prairie Oyster. Then I clamped a firm  control on the jaws, held Ponto's head back and let it slide gulping  down his gullet.    Ponto heaved. He shuddered. He shook himself free, leaped from the  bed and ran around the room, lurching, whining and shaking his head  violently. He stopped and sideswiped his muzzle with a clumsy paw. He  lay down on his back and rolled.    Then the dose took hold. A noble expression seemed to pour over his  brow. His eyes opened wide and remained open, with a clear and friendly  gleam. He stood up, shook himself, ran into the bathroom, gulped some  water from his bowl very noisily, and then came bounding back.    \"Wuff!\" He said to me.    Then Ponto reared on his hind legs, placed two large paws on my  shoulders and proceeded to lick my face thoroughly with a rough, wet  tongue. I had made a friend, I decided. As Androcles had won the  lion by removing the thorn from its paw, so had I tamed Ponto by  administering first-aid.    There was a tap at the door. It was Jimmie. \"Are you all right,  Winnie?\" she asked. \"Is he still asleep?\"    \"Asleep!\" I was contemptuous. \"No, he's awake. Ponto and I are pals.  We understand each other. He had a hang-over and I fixed him. We're  buddies now, aren't we, old fellow?\"    The answer was a low savage growl and I leaped through the door barely  in time to escape his earnest but rather shaky attempt to remove a  couple of pounds of meat from my exterior.    \"Hell!\" I explained, \"that beast's not human. Let's send him back to  the vet's and get something easier to live with--a Yorkshire or a  poodle.\"    \"I'd like a Chihuahua,\" said Germaine, \"or one of those little Belgian  Schipperke gadgets.\"    \"How about a collie?\" I asked.    Germaine raised piteous eyes to me. \"Do you want to make me ill, with  your talk of collies?\" she asked. \"Now come on down to the den and tell  me what's been going on in town.\"    \"Well, Jimmie,\" I began, \"it's a long, long story--\"          CHAPTER 14      \"If it's going to be long,\" she said, \"we'd both better have a drink.  You always think better if you have a glass in your hand.\"    \"Now, what is it you want to know?\" I answered, after we were  comfortably settled in front of the electric fire.    \"It's--it's just that everything is so queer,\" Germaine began. \"You've  changed so that you almost seem like a different person. You even look  better, not so flabby, as though you took regular exercise. At least  I see a change, and then suddenly I find that you've been carrying on  with that Briggs girl and I can't tell whether you've really changed or  are just trying to fool me. She's a nice person, of course, and if you  _must_ have another girl, I'd rather have you pick someone--oh--safe  and comfortable like her. But you said you hadn't been playing with  the office girls. And then there's Ponto. He used to adore you and you  swore by him. Now he tries to bite you and you want to get rid of him.  And then there's all this talk about where you were during Holy Week  and that F.B.I. man and Myrtle tells me they've been asking a lot of  questions about you and Virginia. What _have_ you been doing, dear,  that you can't remember when our whole life may depend on it?\"    \"Jimmie,\" I told her. \"I wish to God I knew. You must believe me when  I tell you I can't remember things before Easter Monday. That was the  second and today is the eleventh and "]]]
