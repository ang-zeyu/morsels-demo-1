And how great was my vengeance and my menance!    We sent against them a single shout; and they became like the dry sticks of  the fold-builders.    Easy have we made the Koran for warningbut, is there any one who receives  the warning?    The people of Lot treated his warning as a lie;    But we sent a stone-charged wind against them all, except the family of Lot,  whom at daybreak we delivered,    By our special gracefor thus we reward the thankful.    He, indeed, had warned them of our severity, but of that warning they  doubted.    Even this guess did they demand: therefore we deprived them of sight,    And said, \"Taste ye my vengeance and my menace;\"    And in the morning a relentless punishment overtook them.    Easy have we made the Koran for warning but, is there any one who receives  the warning?    To the people of Pharaoh also came the threatenings:    All our miracles did they treat as impostures. Therefore seized we them as he  only can seize, who is the Mighty, the Strong.    Are your infidels, O Meccans, better men than these? Is there an exemption  for you in the sacred Books?    Will they say, \"We are a host that lend one another aid?\"    The host shall be routed, and they shall turn them back.    But, that Hour is their threatened time, and that Hour shall be most severe  and bitter.    Verily, the wicked are sunk in bewilderment and folly.    On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces. \"Taste ye the  touch of Hell.\"    All things have we created after a fixed decree:    Our command was but one word, swift as the twinkling of an eye.    Of old, too, have we destroyed the like of youyet is any one warned?    And everything that they do is in the Books;2    Each action, both small and great, is written down.    Verily, amid gardens3 and rivers shall the pious dwell.    In the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King.      _______________________    1 See Sura [lvi.] xxvi. 155; also Sura [lxxxvii.] vii. 71.    2 Kept by the Guardian Angels.    3 The Talmudic descriptions of the Gardensfor the later Jews believed in  more than one Paradiseand of the rivers and trees therein, will be found in  Schr der Talm.

SURA XXXVII.THE RANKS [L.]    MECCA.182 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By the angels ranged in order for Songs of Praise,    And by those who repel demons,1    And by those who recite the Koran for warning,    Truly your God is but one,    Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and  Lord of the East.2    We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars.    They serve also as a guard against every rebellious Satan,    That they overhear not what passeth in the assembly on high, for they are  darted at from every side,3    Driven off and consigned to a lasting torment;    While, if one steal a word by stealth, a glistening flame pursueth him.    Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger  creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them.    But while thou marvellest they mock;    When they are warned, no warning do they take;    And when they see a sign, they fall to mocking,    And say, \"This is no other than clear sorcery:    What! when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?    Our sires also of olden times?\"    Say, Yes; and ye shall be covered with disgrace.    For, one blast only, and lo! they shall gaze around them, And shall say, \"Oh!  woe to us! this is the day of reckoning; This is the day of decision which ye  gainsaid as an untruth.\"    Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their consorts,4 and the  gods whom they adored    Beside God; and guide them to the road for Hell.    Set them forth: they shall be questioned.    \"How now, that ye help not one another?\"    But on this day they shall submit themselves to God,    And shall address one another with mutual reproaches.    They shall say, \"In sooth, ye came to us in well-omened sort:\"5    But they will answer, \"Nay, it was ye who would not believe; and we had no  power whatever over you. Nay, ye were people given to transgress;    Just, therefore, is the doom which our Lord hath passed upon us.6 We shall  surely taste it:    We made you err, for we had erred ourselves.\"    Partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day.    Truly, thus will we deal with the wicked,    Because when it was said to them, There is no God but God, they swelled with  pride,    And said, \"Shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet?\"    Nay, he cometh with truth and confirmeth the Sent Ones of old.    Ye shall surely taste the painful punishment,    And ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought,    Save the sincere servants of God!    A stated banquet shall they have    Of fruits; and honoured shall they be    In the gardens of delight,    Upon couches face to face.    A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain,    Limpid, delicious to those who drink;    It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken.    And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances, fair  like the sheltered egg.7    And they shall address one another with mutual questions.    Saith one of them, \"I truly had a bosom friend,    Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it?    What! when we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be  judged?\"'    He shall say to those around him, \"Will ye look?\"    And he shall look and see him in the midst of Hell.    And he shall say to him, \"By God, thou hadst almost caused me to perish;    And, but for the favour of my Lord, I had surely been of those who have been  brought with thee into torment.\"    \"But do we not die,\" say the blessed,    \"Any other than our first death? and have we escaped the torment?\"8    This truly is the great felicity!    For the like of this should the travailers travail!    Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum?    Verily, we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked.    It is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell;    Its fruits is as it were the heads of Satans;    And, lo! the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it:    Then shall they have, thereon, a mixture of boiling water:    Then shall they return to hell.    They found their fathers erring,    And they hastened on in their footsteps.    Also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred.    Though we had sent warners among them.    But see what was the end of these warned ones,    Except of God's true servants.    Noah called on us of old, and right prompt were we to hear him,9    And we saved him and his family out of the great distress,    And we made his offspring the survivors;    And we left for him with posterity,    \"Peace be on Noah throughout the worlds!\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was one of our believing servants;    And the rest we drowned.    And truly, of his faith was Abraham,    When he brought to his Lord a perfect heart,    When he said to his father and to his people, \"What is this ye worship?    Prefer ye with falsehood gods to God?    And what deem ye of the Lord of the worlds?\"    So gazing he gazed towards the stars,    And said, \"In sooth I am ill:10    And they turned their back on him and departed.    He went aside to their gods and said, \"Do ye not eat?    What aileth you that ye do not speak?\"    He broke out upon them, with the right hand striking:    When his tribesmen came back to him with hasty steps    He said, \"Worship ye what ye carve,    When God hath created you, and that ye make?\"    They said, \"Build up a pyre for him and cast him into the glowing flame.\"    Fain would they plot against him, but we brought them low.    And he said, \"Verily, I repair to my Lord who will guide me:    O Lord give me a son, of the righteous.\"    We announced to him a youth of meekness.    And when he became a full-grown youth,11    His father said to him, \"My son, I have seen in a dream that I should  sacrifice thee; therefore, consider what thou seest right.\"    He said, \"My father, do what thou art bidden; of the patient, if    God please, shalt thou find me.\"    And when they had surrendered them to the will of God, he laid him down upon  his forehead:    We cried unto him, \"O Abraham!    Now hast thou satisfied the vision.\" See how we recompense the righteous.    This was indeed a decisive test.    And we ransomed his son with a costly12 victim,    And we left this13 for him among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON ABRAHAM!\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was of our believing servants.    And we announced Isaac to hima righteous Prophet    And on him and on Isaac we bestowed our blessing. And among their offspring  were well-doers, and others, to their own hurt undoubted sinners.    And of old,14 to Moses and to Aaron shewed we favours:    And both of them, and their people, we rescued from the great distress:    And we succoured them, and they became the conquerors:    And we gave them (Moses and Aaron) each the lucid book:    And we guided them each into the right way:    And we left this for each among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON MOSES AND AARON.\"    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For they were two of our believing servants.    And Elias truly was of our Sent Ones,    When he said to his people, \"Fear ye not God?    Invoke ye Baal and forsake ye the most skilful Creator?    God is your Lord, and the Lord of your sires of old?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34376"],[0,"Our Domestic Birds: Elementary Lessons in Aviculture (#18)"],[1,"that the small chickens may  have fresh land not too far from the farmhouse; land seeded to grass the  year before is best.    The chickens are fed the same dough as is given to the hens, but are fed  oftener. They have a second meal of dough about noon, and their grain  supply, which is given in small troughs, is replenished frequently.  While the hens are with the chickens the food is placed where the hen  confined to the coop can get her share. After the hens are taken away,  the dough is thrown on the grass as the cart passes up and down the rows  of coops.    [Illustration: Fig. 106. Coop for hen and chicks, used on Rhode Island  farm]    When the hay has been harvested and the corn has grown tall, a part of  the young chickens may be removed from the land where they were started,  and the coops placed where they can forage on mowing lands, in  cornfields, and wherever they can go without damage to a growing crop.  As they become too crowded in the small coops, the cockerels are sold  and, if there are still too many birds in a coop, a few pullets are  taken from each of the overcrowded coops and new colonies are started,  so far from their old associates that they will not find their way back.    [Illustration: Fig. 107. Colony house for growing chicks, at Macdonald  College. (Photograph from the college)]    In the early fall as many of the oldest hens are sold as is necessary to  vacate the houses needed for the pullets reared that season. Then the  houses are thoroughly cleaned. (They may not have been cleaned before  for six months or a year.) If a house is to be moved to a new location,  the change is usually made at this time. One or two cartloads of clean  sand are put into each house, to make the floor higher than the ground  outside and to provide an absorbent for the droppings which are allowed  to accumulate. When they are brought to the house, which will probably  be their home as long as they live, the pullets are confined to the  house, or a small temporary yard is attached to it, so that they cannot  wander away. After a few days of confinement they accept the new home as  their headquarters.    =Adaptability of the colony system.= The colony system as developed in  Rhode Island attracted little attention elsewhere until very recent  years. Since about 1900 many descriptions of it have been published, and  numerous efforts have been made to adapt features of this system to  operations in other localities. The principal obstacles to this are snow  and predacious animals. Where snow lies deep for months it is not  practical to keep fowls in widely distributed flocks in winter. In some  places the plan of distributing the houses in summer and parking them  (that is, placing them close together in a regular order) in winter has  worked very well. Where wild animals are numerous, colony methods cannot  be extensively applied, but on most farms a limited application of the  system will greatly increase the amount of poultry that can profitably  be kept.    In England many farmers use smaller colony houses than those in use in  Rhode Island, and move them often, not letting a house stand in the same  spot long enough to kill the grass. Some of the houses used in this way  are provided with small wheels. The advantage of moving houses often is  greatest when the fowls are on good arable land, upon which there are,  or will be, crops that can utilize the manure which the birds leave on  the land. If the houses are moved methodically, the fertilizer will be  evenly distributed.      INTENSIVE POULTRY FARMS    [Illustration: Fig. 108. Colony houses in foreground; sheds for ducks  beyond. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States  Department of Agriculture)]    =Reasons for concentration.= In the early days of the poultry fancy in  this country the tendency was for each fancier to keep as many different  varieties as he could find room for or could afford to buy. Most of  these fanciers were city people who thought that, as they kept their  fowls in small flocks anyway, they might just as well have as many  different kinds of poultry as they had separate compartments in their  poultry yards. When rich men with large estates became interested in  fancy poultry, they usually built large houses containing many small  pens, each with its small yard, and bought a few of each known variety.  By far the greater part of the choicest poultry was kept in small  inclosures, and the flocks that laid remarkably well were usually city  flocks that were given good care. This seemed to a great many people to  prove that fowls did not need the room and the freedom which for ages  they had enjoyed on farms, and that the limit of the possible extension  of the city method of keeping fowls in small, bare yards depended in  any case upon the business capacity of the poultry keeper.    =Concentration not profitable.= Very few people who have not had  experience in growing large numbers of poultry under both good and bad  conditions can be made to understand how futile industry and business  methods are when many other things which affect results are unfavorable.  Even when the obstacles to the application of intensive methods on a  large scale are pointed out to them, most novices imagine that the  difficulties are exaggerated for the purpose of discouraging them. They  think that the successful poultry keeper wishes to discourage  competition, and that the person who has failed does not want to see any  one else succeed, and so warns others to let such projects alone. Those  who have been very successful in their first efforts in a small way  seldom lack perfect confidence in their ability to make good on any  scale if once they are in a position to devote themselves entirely to  this work.    [Illustration: Fig. 109. Commercial laying house at New Jersey  Experiment Station. (Photograph from the station)]    For some seventy or eighty years, but more especially for the last  thirty or forty years, the most conspicuous phase of the poultry  industry in America has been the widespread and continuous movement to  develop large plants of this character. There has been no time, for a  quarter of a century, when poultry plants of this kind, which to the  uninitiated appeared to be highly profitable, have not been numerous.  The owners of many of these plants have claimed that they were making  very large profits, and their claims have led others to engage in the  business, following in every detail the methods in use on some large  plant which they suppose is very successful. So, while well-informed  poultry keepers know that these methods are not practical on a large  scale, except in a few limited lines of production, there is in the  business a constant succession of newcomers who try to operate egg farms  and breeding farms and combinations of various lines by methods that are  not suited to their purpose.    [Illustration: Fig. 110. Interior of a compartment in commercial poultry  house, United States Government farm, Beltsville, Maryland. (Photograph  from Bureau of Animal Industry)]    =Common type of intensive poultry farm.= The ordinary special poultry  farm is a run-down farm upon which have been erected the buildings  necessary for the accommodation of from four or five hundred to two or  three thousand fowls kept in comparatively small yards. The buildings  are nearly always neat and substantial, the fences strong and durable.  The arrangement of the plant is orderly, and, when well stocked with  fowls and kept clean, it presents a most attractive appearance. The  houses and yards for adult stock, the incubator cellar and the brooder  houses, the barns and sheds, and the dwelling of the owner or manager  occupy but a very small part of the farm--usually from one to three  acres. The young chickens are grown year after year on the nearest land  not occupied by the permanent buildings and yards. In most cases the  land is so heavily stocked with them that they secure almost nothing by  foraging.    The routine of work on such a farm is very exacting. The fowls can do so  little for themselves and require so much extra care that the poultry  keeper knows from the start that he cannot make his business pay unless  he gets a very high production. So all his efforts are devoted to this  end. He uses labor-saving appliances, carefully systematizes his work,  and by great effort often succeeds in making a fair profit for a few  years. It is at this stage of his progress that the poultry keeper of  this class does the boasting which misleads others. Then things begin to  go wrong with his stock. His eggs do not hatch well, because his  chickens, while nominally on free range on a farm, have really been no  better off than chickens reared under ordinary conditions in town. His  chickens do not thrive, because they are weak and the land is tainted.  He himself is worn out with long hours of work and no holidays, and if  he does not realize his mistake and close out the business in time, it  is only a question of continuing until his income and credit combined no  longer suffice to keep the business going.    This in brief has been the history of all special poultry farms where  intensive methods were used, except the duck farms and the several  classes to be described farther on in this chapter. By no means all  succeed to even the extent described, because a great many people who go  into the business have so little capital that they have to give up the  business before they have been able to make it show a profit. When the  owners have capital, plants are sometimes operated for years at a loss,  but it is very rare indeed that a poultry farm of this kind (except in  the classes to be described later) is continued for more than seven or  eight years, and few of them last five years. Those who wish to make a  poultry business permanent must adopt other methods.      BROILER GROWING    The desire for what"]]]
