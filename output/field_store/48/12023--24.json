[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35829"],[0,"The 2009 CIA World Factbook (#18)"],[1,"on use of The World Factbook is  described on the Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a  courtesy, please cite The World Factbook when used.        Why are there discrepancies between The World Factbook's demographic  statistics and other sources?    Although estimates and projections start with the same basic data  from censuses, surveys, and registration systems, final estimates  and projections can differ as a result of factors including data  availability, assessment, and methods and protocols.    Data availability  Researchers may obtain specific country data at  different times. Estimates or projections developed before the  results of a census have been released will not be as accurate as  those that take into account new census results.    Assessment  Researchers can differ in their assessment of data  quality and in their estimates based on the available country data.  They often need to adjust their estimates due to such factors as  undercounting in a census or underregistration of births or deaths.    Methods and protocols  Differences in methods and protocols can  shape the way estimates and projections are made of fertility,  mortality, and international migration, and how these data are  integrated with the population data. For example, the US Census  Bureau uses a model that projects the population ahead by single  years of age, a single year at a time (population statistics used in  the Factbook are based on this model), whereas the United Nations  model projects five-year age groups forward, five years at a time.        Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, etc., for each country?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative  units within a country. A comprehensive encyclopedia might be a  source for state/province-level information.        Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Previous editions of the Factbook , beginning with 2000, are  available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA Web site.  Rehosted versions of earlier editions of the Factbook are available  for browsing, as well as for downloading, at other Internet web  sites. We urge caution, however, in attempting to create time series  by stringing together economic data - especially dollar values -  from previous editions of the Factbook . Over time, data sources,  definitions, and economic accounting methods have changed. We  occasionally have made these changes ourselves in order to provide  our readers with the best information available. Also, in the case  of dollar values, changes in relative exchange rates and prices may  make trends difficult to comprehend. Therefore, individuals should  consult additional resources when doing comparative research or  trend analysis.        Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration  between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations  or individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.          Geography ::        Why can't I find a geographic name for a particular country?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of  places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and  cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions  (in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country  maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,  however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as  well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in  The World Factbook.        Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical  order at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the A-Z country entries because even though  the mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected  Taiwanese authorities de facto administer the island and reject  mainland sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic  relations with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government  recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal  government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there  is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China.    The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these may be expanded in the future. A  more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into the  Factbook can be found in the Preliminary statement.        Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,  why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to  the authority and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisors to  direct the worldwide Catholic Church. As the jurisdictional equal of  a state, the Holy See can enter into treaties and sends and receives  diplomatic representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to  administer properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is  recognized under international law as a sovereign state, but it does  not send or receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy  See is included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City  cross-referenced in the Geographic Names appendix.        Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The Palestinian areas of Gaza Strip and West Bank are listed in the  Factbook.        Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United  States Government are not shown on US Government maps.        Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet or  Kashmir?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative  divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government  that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the  spelling, use, and application of geographic names - domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to  uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world  whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly  Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute  among countries are not covered.        What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?    A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean  or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan  and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.          Why is the area of the United States described as \"slightly larger  than China\" in the Factbook , while other sources list China as  larger in area than the United States?    It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and  water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by  the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water  features such as rivers and lakes).    Total area (combining land and water)    United States = 9,826,630 sq km  China = 9,596,960 sq km    Land only (without any water features)    United States = 9,161,923 sq km  China = 9,326,410 sq km        Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of  Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?    The four entities are no longer in The World Factbook because their  status has changed. While they are overseas departments of France,  they are also now recognized as French regions, having equal status  to the 22 metropolitan regions that make up European France. In  other words, they are now recognized as being part of France proper.  Their status is somewhat analogous to Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis  the contiguous United States. Although separated from the larger  geographic entity, they are still considered to be an integral part  of it.            Photos ::        Why do you not have pictures for every country?    Inclusion of photos in The World Factbook is a new feature that  premiered with the unveiling of the redesigned online World Factbook  in June 2009. This is a long-term project, and we plan to  continuously add more photos to the site over time. Eventually, we  hope to have images for every country in the Factbook.        Could you include photos of people from different locations around  the world?    Factbook policy is to not include photos showing identifiable  individuals.        I have great travel photos from my trips abroad. Can I submit them  to your web site to enhance your photo collection?    We appreciate the many offers from the public to contribute to our  photo collection. However, we only use photos from US Government  sources.        Can I use a photo in a report I'm writing?    Yes! All photos in The World Factbook are in the public domain.            Spelling and Pronunciation ::        Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling  in my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs  of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared  using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not  use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in  its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;  they may appear first in some cultures.        Why does the spelling of geographic names, features, cities,  administrative divisions, etc. in the Factbook differ from those  used in my country?

Telephones - mobile cellular      This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephone  subscribers.    Terminology      Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word  Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of  dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and  other entities in addition to the traditional countries or  independent states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for  various civil defense, security, and defense activities in many  entries. The Independence entry includes the usual colonial  independence dates and former ruling states as well as other  significant nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date  or the date of unification, federation, confederation,  establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their  dependency status noted in this same entry.        Terrain      This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Time difference      This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two ways. First, it  is stated as the difference in hours between the capital of an  entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during Standard Time.  Additionally, the difference in time between the capital of an  entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided. Note  that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously  observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.    Time zones      Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,  Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States) and the  island of Greenland observe more than one official time depending on  the number of designated time zones within their boundaries. An  illustration of time zones throughout the world and within countries  can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World map included in  the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.        Total fertility rate      This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that  would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their  childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility  rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct  measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since  it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential  for population change in the country. A rate of two children per  woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting  in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two  children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age  is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for  families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and  for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children  indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global  fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most  pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe,  where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the  next 50 years.        Total renewable water resources      This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a  country in cubic kilometers of precipitation, recharged ground  water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries. The values  have been adjusted to account for overlap resulting from surface  flow recharge of groundwater sources. Total renewable water  resources provides the water total available to a country but does  not include water resource totals that have been reserved for  upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.  Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect  the total available in any given year. Annual available resources  can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and  weather variations.        Trafficking in persons      Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who  are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation.  The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged  with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection  issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in  forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude,  and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a  multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and  freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown,  inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000,  the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the  US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad.  One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department  of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the  government response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150  countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across  their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or  obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the  annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts  to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are  those listed in the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2  Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following tier rating definitions:  Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making  significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:  1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,  2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to  combat trafficking in persons, or,  3. they have committed to take action over the next year.  Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to  do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential  non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.    Transnational issues      This category includes four entries - Disputes - international,  Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking in persons,  and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going beyond  national boundaries.    Transportation      This category includes the entries dealing with the means for  movement of people and goods.        Transportation - note      This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.        U          Unemployment rate      This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.        Urbanization      This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a  population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of  the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the  country. The second, rate of urbanization, describes the projected  average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the  given period of time. Additionally, the World entry includes a list  of the ten largest urban agglomerations. An urban agglomeration is  defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban "]]]
