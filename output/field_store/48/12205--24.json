Your side of the province on the sea coast is all  stone--I never seed such a pro per sight of rocks in my  life, it's enough to starve a rabbit. Well, tother side  on the Bay of Fundy is a superfine country, there aint  the beat of it to be found any where. Now, would'nt the  folks living away up to the Bay, be pretty fools to go  to Halifax, when they can go to St. John with half the  trouble. St. John is the natural capital of the Bay of  Fundy, it will be the largest city in America next to  New York. It has an immense back country as big as Great  Britain, a first chop river, and amazin sharp folks, most  as cute as the Yankees--it's a splendid location for  business. Well, they draw all the produce of the Bay  shores, and where the produce goes the supplies return--  it will take the whole trade of the Province; I guess  your rich folks will find they've burnt their fingers,  they've put their foot in it, that's a fact. Houses with  out tenants--wharves without shipping, a town without  people--what a grand investment!! If you have any loose  dollars, let 'em out on mortgage in Halifax, that's the  security--keep clear of the country for your life--the  people may run, but the town can't. No, take away the  troops, and you're done--you'll sing the dead march folks  did at Louisburg and Shelburne. Why you hant got a single  thing worth havin, but a good harbor, and as for that  the coast is full on 'em. You hav'nt a pine log, a spruce  board or a refuse shingle; you neither raise wheat, oats,  or hay, nor never can; you have no staples on airth,  unless it be them iron ones for the padlocks, in  Bridewell--you've sowed pride and reaped poverty, take  care of your crop, for it's worth harvestin--you have no  River and no Country, what in the name of fortin have  you to trade on? But, said he, (and he shewed the whites  of his eyes like a wall eyed horse) but, said he, Mr.  Slick, how is it then, Halifax ever grew at all, has'nt  it got what it always had; it's no worse than it was. I  guess, said I, that pole aint strong enough to bear you,  neither; if you trust to that you'll be into the brook,  as sure as you are born; you once had the trade of the  whole Province, but St. John has run off with that  now--you've lost all but your trade in blue berries and  rabbits with the niggers at Hammond Plains. You've lost  your customers, your rivals have a better stand for  business--they've got the corner store--four great streets  meet there, and its near the market slip.    Well he stared; says he, I believe you're right, but I  never thought of that afore; (thinks I, nobody ever  suspect you of the trick of thinkin that ever I heer'd  tell of) some of our great men, said he, laid it all to  your folks selling so many Clocks and Polyglot Bibles,  they say you have taken off a horrid sight of money; did  they, indeed, said I; well, I guess it tante pins and  needles that's the expense of house-keepin, it is something  more costly than that. Well, some folks say its the Banks,  says he; better still, says I, perhaps you've hearn tell  too that greasing the axle, makes a gig harder to draw,  for there's jist about as much sense in that. Well then,  says he, others say its smugglin has made us so poor.  That guess, said I, is most as good as tother one, whoever  found out that secret ought to get a patent for it, for  its worth knowin. Then the country has grown poorer,  has'nt it, because it has bought cheaper this year, than  it did the year before? Why, your folks are cute chaps,  I vow; they'd puzzle a Philadelphia Lawyer, they are so  amazin knowin. Ah, said he, and he rubb'd his hands and  smiled like a young doctor, when he gets his first patient;  ah, said he, if the timber duties are altered, down comes  St. John, body and breeches, it's built on a poor  foundation--its all show--they are speculatin like  mad--they'll ruin themselves. Says I, if you wait till  they're dead, for your fortin, it will be one while, I  tell you, afore you pocket the shiners. Its no joke waitin  for a dead man's shoes. Suppose an old feller of 80 was  to say when that are young feller dies, I'm to inherit  his property, what would you think? Why, I guess you'd  think be was an old fool. No sir, if the English don't  want their timber we do want it all, we have used ourn  up, we hant got a stick even to whittle. If the British  dont offer we will, and St. John, like a dear little  weeping widow, will dry up her tears, and take to frolickin  agin and accept it right off. There is'nt at this moment  such a location hardly in America, as St. John; for beside  all its other advantages, it has this great one, its only  rival, Halifax, has got a dose of opium that will send  it snoring out of the world, like a feller who falls  asleep on the ice of a winter's night. It has been asleep  so long, I actilly think it never will wake. Its an easy  death too, you may rouse them up if you like, but I vow  I wont. I once brought a feller too that was drowned,  and one night he got drunk and quilted me, I could'nt  walk for a week; says I, your the last chap I'll ever  save from drowning in all my born days, if that's all  the thanks I get for it. No Sir, Halifax has lost the  run of its custom. Who does Yarmouth trade with? St.  John. Who does Annapolis County trade with? St. John.  Who do all the folks on the Basin of Mines, and Bay shore,  trade with? St John. Who does Cumberland trade with? St  John. Well Pictou, Lunenburg and Liverpool, supply  themselves, and the rest that aint worth havin, trade  with Halifax. They take down a few half starved pigs,  old viteran geese, and long legged fowls, some ram mutton  and tuf beef; and swap them for tea, sugar, and such  little notions for their old women to home; while the  rail roads and canals of St. John are goin to cut off  your Gulf Shore trade to Miramichi, and along there.  Flies live in the summer and die in winter, you're jist  as noisy in war as those little critters, but you sing  small in peace.    No, your done for, you are up a tree, you may depend;  pride must fall. Your town is like a ball room arter a  dance. The folks have eat, drank, and frolicked, and left  an empty house; the lamps and hangings are left, but the  people are gone. Is there no remedy for this? said he,  and he looked as wild as a Cherokee Indian. Thinks I,  the handle is fitten on proper tight now. Well, says I,  when a man has a cold, he had ought to look out pretty  sharp, afore it gets seated on his lungs; if he don't,  he gets into a gallopin consumption, and it's gone goose  with him. There is a remedy, if applied in time: make a  rail road to Minas Basin, and you have a way for your  customers to get to you, and a conveyance for your goods  to them. When I was in New York last, a cousin of mine,  Hezekiah Slick, said to me, I do believe Sam, I shall be  ruined; I've lost all my custom, they are widening and  improving the streets, and there's so many carts and  people to work in it, folks can't come to my shop to  trade, what on airth shall I do, and I'm payin a dreadful  high rent too? Stop Ki, says I, when the street is all  finished off and slicked up, they'll all come back agin,  and a whole raft more on 'em too, you'll sell twice as  much as ever you did, you'll put off a proper swad of  goods next year, you may depend; and so he did, he made  money, hand over hand. A rail-road, will bring back your  customers, if done right off; but wait till trade has  made new channels, and fairly gets settled in them, and  you'll never divart it agin to all etarnity. When a feller  waits till a gall gets married, I guess it will be too  late to pop the question then. St. John MUST go ahead,  at any rate; you MAY, if you choose, but you must exert  yourselves I tell you. If a man has only one leg, and  wants to walk, he must get an artificial one. If you have  no river, make a rail road, and that will supply its  place. But, says he, Mr. Slick, people say it never will  pay in the world; they say its as mad a scheme as the  canal. Do they indeed, says I, send them to me then, and  I'll fit the handle on to them in tu tu's. I say it will  pay, and the best proof is, our folks will take tu thirds  of the stock. Did you ever hear any one else but your  folks, ax whether a dose of medicine would pay when it  was given to save life? If that everlastin long Erie  canal can secure to New York the supply of that far off  country, most tother side of creation, surely a rail road  of 45 miles can give you the trade of the Bay of Fundy.  A rail road will go from Halifax to Windsor and make them  one town, easier to send goods from one to tother, than  from Governor Campbell's House to Admiral Cockburn's. A  bridge makes a town, a river makes a town, a canal makes  a town, but a rail road is bridge, river, thoroughfare,  canal, all in one; what a wappin large place that would  make, would'nt it? It would be the dandy, that's a fact.  No, when you go back, take a piece of chalk, and the  first dark night, write on every door in Halifax, in  large letters--a rail road--and if they don't know the  meanin of it, says you its a Yankee word; if you'll go  to Sam Slick, the Clockmaker, (the chap that fixed a  Yankee handle on to a Halifax blade, and I made him a  scrape of my leg, as much as to say, that's you,) every  man that buys a Clock shall hear all about a RAIL ROAD.          No. XVIII    The Grahamite and the Irish Pilot.    I think, said I, this is a happy country, Mr. Slick.  The people are fortunately all of one origin, there are  no national jealousies to divide, and no very violent  politics to agitate them. They appear to be cheerful and  contented, and are a civil, good natured, hospitable  race. Considering the unsettled state of almost every  part of the world, I think I would as soon cast my lot  in Nova-Scotia as in any part I know of.

But let us imagine some insistent Socrates, who, whatever reason we  give him, continues to demand a reason for the reason. We must sooner  or later, and probably before very long, be driven to a point where we  cannot find any further reason, and where it becomes almost certain that  no further reason is even theoretically discoverable. Starting with the  common beliefs of daily life, we can be driven back from point to point,  until we come to some general principle, or some instance of a general  principle, which seems luminously evident, and is not itself capable  of being deduced from anything more evident. In most questions of  daily life, such as whether our food is likely to be nourishing and not  poisonous, we shall be driven back to the inductive principle, which we  discussed in Chapter VI. But beyond that, there seems to be no further  regress. The principle itself is constantly used in our reasoning,  sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously; but there is no  reasoning which, starting from some simpler self-evident principle,  leads us to the principle of induction as its conclusion. And the same  holds for other logical principles. Their truth is evident to us, and we  employ them in constructing demonstrations; but they themselves, or at  least some of them, are incapable of demonstration.    Self-evidence, however, is not confined to those among general  principles which are incapable of proof. When a certain number of  logical principles have been admitted, the rest can be deduced from  them; but the propositions deduced are often just as self-evident as  those that were assumed without proof. All arithmetic, moreover, can  be deduced from the general principles of logic, yet the simple  propositions of arithmetic, such as 'two and two are four', are just as  self-evident as the principles of logic.    It would seem, also, though this is more disputable, that there are some  self-evident ethical principles, such as 'we ought to pursue what is  good'.    It should be observed that, in all cases of general principles,  particular instances, dealing with familiar things, are more evident  than the general principle. For example, the law of contradiction states  that nothing can both have a certain property and not have it. This is  evident as soon as it is understood, but it is not so evident as that a  particular rose which we see cannot be both red and not red. (It is of  course possible that parts of the rose may be red and parts not red, or  that the rose may be of a shade of pink which we hardly know whether to  call red or not; but in the former case it is plain that the rose as a  whole is not red, while in the latter case the answer is theoretically  definite as soon as we have decided on a precise definition of 'red'.)  It is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to  see the general principle. Only those who are practised in dealing with  abstractions can readily grasp a general principle without the help of  instances.    In addition to general principles, the other kind of self-evident truths  are those immediately derived from sensation. We will call such truths  'truths of perception', and the judgements expressing them we will  call 'judgements of perception'. But here a certain amount of care  is required in getting at the precise nature of the truths that are  self-evident. The actual sense-data are neither true nor false. A  particular patch of colour which I see, for example, simply exists: it  is not the sort of thing that is true or false. It is true that there is  such a patch, true that it has a certain shape and degree of brightness,  true that it is surrounded by certain other colours. But the patch  itself, like everything else in the world of sense, is of a radically  different kind from the things that are true or false, and therefore  cannot properly be said to be _true_. Thus whatever self-evident truths  may be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data  from which they are obtained.    It would seem that there are two kinds of self-evident truths of  perception, though perhaps in the last analysis the two kinds may  coalesce. First, there is the kind which simply asserts the _existence_  of the sense-datum, without in any way analysing it. We see a patch  of red, and we judge 'there is such-and-such a patch of red', or more  strictly 'there is that'; this is one kind of intuitive judgement of  perception. The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex,  and we subject it to some degree of analysis. If, for instance, we see a  _round_ patch of red, we may judge 'that patch of red is round'. This is  again a judgement of perception, but it differs from our previous kind.  In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour  and shape: the colour is red and the shape is round. Our judgement  analyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by  stating that the red colour is round in shape. Another example of this  kind of judgement is 'this is to the right of that', where 'this'  and 'that' are seen simultaneously. In this kind of judgement the  sense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each  other, and the judgement asserts that these constituents have this  relation.    Another class of intuitive judgements, analogous to those of sense and  yet quite distinct from them, are judgements of _memory_. There is some  danger of confusion as to the nature of memory, owing to the fact that  memory of an object is apt to be accompanied by an image of the object,  and yet the image cannot be what constitutes memory. This is easily seen  by merely noticing that the image is in the present, whereas what is  remembered is known to be in the past. Moreover, we are certainly able  to some extent to compare our image with the object remembered, so  that we often know, within somewhat wide limits, how far our image is  accurate; but this would be impossible, unless the object, as opposed to  the image, were in some way before the mind. Thus the essence of memory  is not constituted by the image, but by having immediately before the  mind an object which is recognized as past. But for the fact of memory  in this sense, we should not know that there ever was a past at all,  nor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a man  born blind can understand the word 'light'. Thus there must be intuitive  judgements of memory, and it is upon them, ultimately, that all our  knowledge of the past depends.    The case of memory, however, raises a difficulty, for it is notoriously  fallacious, and thus throws doubt on the trustworthiness of intuitive  judgements in general. This difficulty is no light one. But let us  first narrow its scope as far as possible. Broadly speaking, memory is  trustworthy in proportion to the vividness of the experience and to its  nearness in time. If the house next door was struck by lightning half a  minute ago, my memory of what I saw and heard will be so reliable that  it would be preposterous to doubt whether there had been a flash at  all. And the same applies to less vivid experiences, so long as they are  recent. I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in  the same chair in which I am sitting now. Going backward over the day,  I find things of which I am quite certain, other things of which I am  almost certain, other things of which I can become certain by thought  and by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which I  am by no means certain. I am quite certain that I ate my breakfast this  morning, but if I were as indifferent to my breakfast as a philosopher  should be, I should be doubtful. As to the conversation at breakfast,  I can recall some of it easily, some with an effort, some only with a  large element of doubt, and some not at all. Thus there is a continual  gradation in the degree of self-evidence of what I remember, and a  corresponding gradation in the trustworthiness of my memory.    Thus the first answer to the difficulty of fallacious memory is to say  that memory has degrees of self-evidence, and that these correspond  to the degrees of its trustworthiness, reaching a limit of perfect  self-evidence and perfect trustworthiness in our memory of events which  are recent and vivid.    It would seem, however, that there are cases of very firm belief in a  memory which is wholly false. It is probable that, in these cases, what  is really remembered, in the sense of being immediately before the mind,  is something other than what is falsely believed in, though something  generally associated with it. George IV is said to have at last believed  that he was at the battle of Waterloo, because he had so often said that  he was. In this case, what was immediately remembered was his repeated  assertion; the belief in what he was asserting (if it existed) would  be produced by association with the remembered assertion, and would  therefore not be a genuine case of memory. It would seem that cases of  fallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way, i.e. they  can be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all.    One important point about self-evidence is made clear by the case of  memory, and that is, that self-evidence has degrees: it is not a quality  which is simply present or absent, but a quality which may be more or  less present, in gradations ranging from absolute certainty down to an  almost imperceptible faintness. Truths of perception and some of the  principles of logic have the very highest degree of self-evidence;  truths of immediate memory have an almost equally high degree. The  inductive principle has less self-evidence than some of the other  principles of logic, such as 'what follows from a true premiss must be  true'. Memories have a diminishing self-evidence as they become remoter  and fainter; the truths "]]]
