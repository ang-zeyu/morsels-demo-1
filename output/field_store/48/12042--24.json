Leave everything to me, and when you get back we'll have _mynheer_ so  drunk he won't know a tax statement from an Edammer cheese.\"    Muller's face failed to brighten at the hopeful program mapped out by  his associate. If anything, his agitation increased.    \"But he might ask questions to-day, _kapitein_--questions I cannot  answer.\"    Van Slyck's lips curled. His thought was: \"Good God, what am I going to  do with this lump of jelly-fish?\" But he replied encouragingly:    \"No danger of that at all, _mynheer_. There are certain formalities that  must be gone through first before a new resident takes hold. It would  not be good form to kick his predecessor out of office without giving  the latter a chance to close his books--even a pig of a Yankee knows  that. Accept his credentials if he offers them, but tell him business  must wait till the morning. Above all, keep your head, say nothing, and  be as damnably civil as though he were old Van Schouten himself. If we  can swell his head none of us will have to worry.\"    \"But my accounts, _kapitein_,\" Muller faltered.    \"To the devil with your accounts,\" Van Slyck exclaimed, losing  patience. \"Go to Barang, fix them up as best you can.\"    \"I can never get them to balance,\" Muller cried. \"Our dealings--the  rattan we shipped--you know.\" He looked fearfully around.    \"There never was a _controlleur_ yet that didn't line his own pockets,\"  Van Slyck sneered. \"But his books never showed it. You are a  book-keeper, _mynheer_, and you know how to juggle figures. Forget these  transactions; if you can't, charge the moneys you got to some account.  There are no vouchers or receipts in Bulungan. A handy man with figures,  like yourself, ought to be able to make a set of accounts that that  ferret Sachsen himself could not find a flaw in.\"    \"But that is not the worst,\" Muller cried despairingly. \"There are the  taxes, the taxes I should have sent to Batavia, the rice that we sold  instead to Ah Sing.\"    \"Good God! Have you grown a conscience?\" Van Slyck snarled. \"If you  have, drown yourself in the bay. Lie, you fool, lie! Tell him the  weevils ruined the crop, tell him the floods drowned it, tell him a  tornado swept the fields bare, lay it to the hill Dyaks--anything,  anything! But keep your nerve, or you'll hang sure.\"    Muller retreated before the captain's vehemence.    \"But the _bruinevels_, _kapitein_?\" he faltered. \"They may tell him  something different.\"    \"Wobanguli won't; he's too wise to say anything,\" Van Slyck asserted  firmly. \"None of the others will dare to, either--all we've got to do is  to whisper Ah Sing's name to them. But there's little danger of any of  them except the Rajah seeing him until after the _Prins_ is gone. Once  she's out of the harbor I don't care what they say--no word of it will  ever get back to Batavia.\"    His devilishly handsome smile gleamed sardonically, and he twisted his  nicely waxed mustache. Muller's hands shook.    \"_Kapitein_,\" he replied in an odd, strained voice, \"I am afraid of this  Peter Gross. I had a dream last night, a horrible dream--I am sure it  was him I saw. I was in old de Jonge's room in the residency  building--you know the room--and the stranger of my dream sat in old de  Jonge's chair.    \"He asked me questions, questions of how I came here, and what I have  done here, and I talked and talked till my mouth was dry as the marsh  grass before the rains begin to fall. All the while he listened, and his  eyes seemed to bore through me, as though they said: 'Judas, I know  what is going on in your heart.'    \"At last, when I could say no more, he asked me: '_Mynheer_, how did  Mynheer de Jonge die?' Then I fell on the ground before him and told him  all--all. At the last, soldiers came to take me away to hang me, but  under the very shadow of the gallows a bird swooped down out of the air  and carried me away, away into the jungle. Then I awoke.\"    Van Slyck broke into scornful laughter.    \"_Mynheer_, you had enough to worry about before you started dreaming,\"  he said bluntly. \"If you're going to fill your head with such  foolishness I'll leave you to your own devices.\"    \"But, _kapitein_, it might be a warning,\" Muller cried desperately.    \"Heaven doesn't send ravens to cheat such rogues as you and I from the  gallows, _mynheer_,\" Van Slyck mocked. \"We might as well get ready to  meet our new resident. I see a boat putting off from the ship.\"          CHAPTER XII    PETER GROSS'S RECEPTION      When Peter Gross stepped ashore at the foot of the slope on which the  fort and government buildings stood, three thousand pairs of eyes, whose  owners were securely hidden in the copses and undergrowth for a quarter  of a mile in both directions along the shore-line, watched his every  movement. With the lightning celerity with which big news travels word  had been spread through Bulungan town that the new resident was coming  ashore, and every inhabitant possessed of sound legs to bear him had  run, crawled, or scrambled to a favorable patch of undergrowth where he  could get a first glimpse of the _orang blanda_ chief without being  observed.    Perfectly aware of this scrutiny, but calmly oblivious to it, Peter  Gross stepped out of the boat and directed the sailors who rowed it to  return to their ship. As their oars bit the water he faced the path that  wound up the hillside and walked along it at a dignified and easy pace.  His sharp ears caught the incessant rustle of leaves, a rustle not made  by the breeze, and the soft grinding of bits of coral under the pressure  of naked feet.    Once he surprised a dusky face in the bush, but his glance roved to the  next object in his line of vision in placid unconcern. As he mounted the  rise he made for the _controlleur's_ home, strolling along as calmly as  though he were on a Batavia lane.    \"_Duivel noch toe!_\" Muller exclaimed as the boat returned to the ship.  \"He is coming here alone.\" His voice had an incredulous ring as though  he half doubted the evidence of his own senses.    Van Slyck's eyes danced with satisfaction, and his saturnine smile was  almost Mephistophelian.    \"By Nassau, I was right, after all, _mynheer_,\" he exclaimed. \"He's an  ass of a Yankee that Van Schouten is having some sport with in sending  him here.\"    \"There may be something behind this, _kapitein_,\" Muller cautioned  apprehensively, but Van Slyck cut him short.    \"Behind this, _mynheer_? The fool does not even know how to maintain the  dignity due his office. Would he land this way, like a pedler with his  pack, if he did? Oh, we are going to have some rare sport--\"    Van Slyck's merriment broke loose in a guffaw.    \"You-you will not do anything violent, _kapitein_?\" Muller asked  apprehensively.    \"Violent?\" Van Slyck exclaimed. \"I wouldn't hurt him for a thousand  guilders, _mynheer_. He's going to be more fun than even you.\"    The frank sneer that accompanied the remark made the captain's meaning  sufficiently clear to penetrate even so sluggish a mind as the  _controlleur's_. He reddened, and an angry retort struggled to his  lips, but he checked it before it framed itself into coherent language.  He was too dependent on Van Slyck, he realized, to risk offending the  latter now, but for the first time in their acquaintanceship his  negative dislike of his more brilliant associate deepened to a positive  aversion.    \"What are we going to do, _kapitein_?\" he asked quietly.    \"Welcome him, _mynheer_!\" Again the sardonic smile. \"Treat him to some  of your fine cigars and a bottle of your best Hollands. Draw him out,  make him empty his belly to us. When we have sucked him dry and drenched  him with liquor we will pack him back to the _Prins_ to tell Kapitein  Enckel what fine fellows we are. To-morrow we'll receive him with all  ceremony--I'll instruct him this afternoon how a resident is installed  in his new post and how he must conduct himself.    \"Enckel will leave here without a suspicion, Mynheer Gross will be ready  to trust even his purse to us if we say the word, and we will have  everything our own way as before. But s-s-st! Here he comes!\" He lifted  a restraining hand. \"Lord, what a shoulder of beef! Silence, now, and  best your manners, _mynheer_. Leave the talking to me.\"    Peter Gross walked along the kenari-tree shaded lane between the  evergreen hedges clipped with characteristic Dutch primness to a perfect  plane. Behind him formed a growing column of natives whose curiosity had  gotten the better of their diffidence.    The resident's keen eyes instantly ferreted out Van Slyck and Muller in  the shadows of the veranda, but he gave no sign of recognition. Mounting  the steps of the porch, he stood for a moment in dignified expectancy,  his calm, gray eyes taking the measure of each of its occupants.    An apprehensive shiver ran down Muller's spine as he met Peter Gross's  glance--those gray eyes were so like the silent, inscrutable eyes of the  stranger in de Jonge's chair whom he saw in his dream. It was Van Slyck  who spoke first.    \"You were looking for some one, _mynheer_?\" he asked.    \"For Mynheer Muller, the _controlleur_ and acting resident. I think I  have found him.\"    The mildness with which these words were spoken restored the captain's  aplomb, momentarily shaken by Peter Gross's calm, disconcerting stare.    \"You have a message for us?\"    \"I have,\" Peter Gross replied.    \"Ah, from Kapitein Enckel, I suppose,\" Van Slyck remarked urbanely.  \"Your name is--\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#18)"],[1,"  he saw a list of the barons who had joined the French king he found  among them the name of his favorite son John, and his heart was  broken. He died a few days later.    II    Henry's eldest surviving son, Richard, was crowned at Westminster  Abbey in 1190. He took the title of Richard I but is better known  as \"C[oe]ur de Lion\" (_the lion-hearted_), a name which was given  him on account of his bravery. He had wonderful strength and his  brave deeds were talked about all over the land.    With such a man for their king, the English people became devoted  to chivalry, and on every field of battle brave men vied with another  in brave deeds. Knighthood was often the reward of valor. Then, as  now, knighthood was usually conferred upon a man by his king or  queen. A part of the ceremony consisted in the sovereign's touching  the kneeling subject's soldier with the flat of a sword and saying,  \"Arise, Sir Knight.\" This was called \"the accolade.\"    Richard did not stay long in England after his coronation. In 1191  he went with Philip of France on a Crusade.    The French and English Crusaders together numbered more than one  hundred thousand men. They sailed to the Holy Land and joined an  army of Christian soldiers encamped before the city of Acre. The  besiegers had despaired of taking the city but when reinforced  they gained fresh courage.    [Illustration: THE ACCOLADE]    C[oe]ur de Lion now performed deeds of valor which gave him fame  throughout Europe. He was the terror of the Saracens. In every  attack on Acre he led the Christians and when the city was captured  he planted his banner in triumph on its walls.    So great was the terror inspired everywhere in the Holy Land by  the name of Richard that Moslem mothers are said to have made their  children quiet by threatening to send for the English king.    Every night when the Crusaders encamped, the heralds blew their  trumpets, and cried three times, \"Save the Holy Sepulchre!\" And  the Crusaders knelt and said, \"Amen!\"    The great leader of the Saracens was Saladin. He was a model of  heroism and the two leaders, one the champion of the Christians  and the other the champion of the Mohammedans, vied with each other  in knightly deeds.    Just before one battle Richard rode down the Saracen line and boldly  called for any one to step forth and fight him alone. No one responded  to the challenge, for the most valiant of the Saracens did not dare  to meet the lion-hearted king.    After the capture of Acre Richard took As'ca-lon. Then he made a  truce with Saladin, by which the Christians acquired the right for  three years to visit the Holy City without paying for the privilege.    [Illustration: RICHARD C[OE]UR DE LION AND SALADIN, RULER OF THE  FAITHFUL, ENTERING JERUSALEM]    III    Richard now set out on his voyage home. He was wrecked, however,  on the Adriatic Sea near Trieste. To get to England he was obliged  to go through the lands of Leopold, duke of Austria, one of his  bitterest enemies. So he disguised himself as a poor pilgrim returning  from the Holy Land.    But he was recognized by a costly ring that he wore and was taken  prisoner at Vienna by Duke Leopold. His people in England anxiously  awaited his return, and when after a long time he did not appear  they were sadly distressed. There is a legend that a faithful squire  named Blondel went in search of him, as a wandering minstrel traveled  for months over central Europe, vainly seeking for news of his  master.    At last one day, while singing one of Richard's favorite songs  near the walls of the castle where the king was confined, he heard  the song repeated from a window. He recognized the voice of Richard.  From the window Richard told him to let the English people and  the people of Europe know where he was confined, and the minstrel  immediately went upon his mission.    Soon Europe was astounded to learn that brave Richard of England,  the great champion of Christendom, was imprisoned. The story of  Blondel is probably not true, but what is true is that England  offered to ransom Richard; that the Pope interceded for him; and  that finally it was agreed that he should be given up on the payment  of a very large sum of money. The English people quickly paid the  ransom and Richard was freed.    The king of France had little love for Richard, and Richard's own  brother John had less. Both were sorry that C[oe]ur de Lion was  at liberty.    John had taken charge of the kingdom during his brother's absence,  and hoped that Richard might pass the rest of his days in the prison  castle of Leopold.    As soon as Richard was released, the French king sent word to John,  \"The devil is loose again.\" And a very disappointed man was John  when all England rang with rejoicing at Richard's return.    IV    Upon the death of Richard, in 1199, Arthur, the son of his elder  brother Geoffrey, was the rightful heir to the throne. John, however,  seized the throne himself and cast Arthur into prison. There is a  legend that he ordered Arthur's eyes to be put out with red hot  irons. The jailor, however, was touched by the boy's prayer for  mercy and spared him. But Arthur was not to escape his uncle long.  It is said that one night the king took him out upon the Seine in  a little boat, murdered him and cast his body into the river.    [Illustration: PRINCE ARTHUR PLEADS WITH HIS JAILER]    Besides being a king of England, John was duke of Normandy, and  Philip, king of France, now summoned him to France to answer for  the crime of murdering Arthur. John would not answer the summons  and this gave the king of France an excuse for taking possession of  Normandy. He did so, and thus this great province was lost forever  to England. Nothing in France was left to John except A-qui-taine',  which had come to him through his mother.    John's government was unjust and tyrannical, and the bishops and  barons determined to preserve their rights and the rights of the  people. They met on a plain called Runnymeade, and there forced  John to sign the famous \"Magna Carta\" (_Great Charter_).    Magna Carta is the most valuable charter ever granted by any sovereign  to his people. In it King John names all the rights which belong  to the citizens under a just government, and he promises that no  one of these rights shall ever be taken away from any subjects  of the English king. For violating this promise one English king  lost his life and another lost the American colonies.    Magna Carta was signed in 1215. A year after he signed it the king  died. His son, Henry III, succeeded him.    [Illustration: JOHN SIGNING MAGNA CARTA]          LOUIS THE NINTH    KING FROM 1226-1270    I    After the time of Barbarossa and Richard C[oe]ur de Lion lived  another great Crusading king. This was a grandson of Philip II,  named Louis IX, who became sovereign of France in 1226. He was  then only eleven years old, so for some years his mother ruled the  kingdom.    A few years after he had begun to reign Louis decided to make his  brother Alphonse the governor of a certain part of France. The  nobles of the region refused to have Alphonse as governor and invited  Henry III of England to help them in a revolt.    Henry crossed to France with an army to support the rebellious  nobles. He was duke of Aquitaine and Gascony; so that although he  was the king in England he had to do homage to the king of France  for his possessions in that country, and fight for him if called  upon to do so.    Louis gathered an army and hastened to meet the English troops.  He drove Henry from place to place, until at last he forced him  to make terms of peace. The rebellious nobles who had invited the  English king to France soon after swore allegiance to Louis and  afterwards he had little trouble in his kingdom.    [Illustration: THE CHILD KING, LOUIS THE NINTH, BESTOWING ALMS]    Once Louis was dangerously ill and his life was despaired of. Finally  he was believed to be dying and his wife and chief officials gathered  round his bed to await the end. Suddenly he roused himself and  said in a feeble voice, \"The cross! The cross!\"    They laid the cross upon his heart and he clasped it fervently.  For a while he slumbered. When he awoke he appeared much better.  In a day or two he was entirely well. He then made a solemn vow  that in thankfulness for his restoration he would go on a Crusade  to the Holy Land.    Louis lived at a time when everybody was full of the Crusading  spirit. A few years before he was born even the children in France  and Germany started out upon a Crusade of their own. It is called  in history the \"Children's Crusade.\" Several thousand left their  homes and marched toward the Mediterranean. They thought that God  would open a pathway to the Holy Land for them through its waters.  A number of them died of cold and hunger when trying to cross the  Alps. Some reached Rome, and when the Pope saw them he told them  to return home and not think of going on a Crusade until they were  grown up.    [Illustration: THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE]    It is easy to understand how in such an age people flocked to Louis'  banner when he asked for volunteers to go with him on another Crusade.    In a few months forty thousand Crusaders assembled at a French  port on the Mediterranean Sea. On a bright day in August, 1248,  they went on board the fleet which was ready to sail. The king  called to the Crusaders, \"Sing in the name of God. Shout forth  his praises as we sail away.\" Then quickly, on ship after ship,  shouts of praise burst from the lips of thousands and amid the  grand chorus the fleet began its voyage.    The Crusaders went to Dam-i-et'ta, in Egypt. Louis was so eager to  land that he jumped into water up to his waist and waded ashore.  He captured the city without striking a blow.    He had resolved to make war on the Moslems in Egypt rather than  in the Holy Land, so when he left Damietta he marched southward.    He"]]]
