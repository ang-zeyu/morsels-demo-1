Well?\"    \"Well, Milton had an idea that it was Rand-Brown who ragged his study.\"    \"What made him think that?\"    Trevor related the Shoeblossom incident.    Clowes became quite excited.    \"Then Rand-Brown must be the man,\" he said. \"Why don't you go and  tackle him? Probably he's got the bat in his study.\"    \"It's not in his study,\" said Trevor, \"because I looked everywhere for  it, and got him to turn out his pockets, too. And yet I'll swear he  knows something about it. One thing struck me as a bit suspicious. I  went straight into his study and showed him that last letter--about the  bat, you know, and accused him of writing it. Now, if he hadn't been in  the business somehow, he wouldn't have understood what was meant by  their saying 'the bat you lost'. It might have been an ordinary  cricket-bat for all he knew. But he offered to let me search the study.  It didn't strike me as rum till afterwards. Then it seemed fishy. What  do you think?\"    Clowes thought so too, but admitted that he did not see of what use the  suspicion was going to be. Whether Rand-Brown knew anything about the  affair or not, it was quite certain that the bat was not with him.    O'Hara, meanwhile, had decided that the time had come for him to resume  his detective duties. Moriarty agreed with him, and they resolved that  that night they would patronise the vault instead of the gymnasium, and  take a holiday as far as their boxing was concerned. There was plenty  of time before the Aldershot competition.    Lock-up was still at six, so at a quarter to that hour they slipped  down into the vault, and took up their position.    A quarter of an hour passed. The lock-up bell sounded faintly. Moriarty  began to grow tired.    \"Is it worth it?\" he said, \"an' wouldn't they have come before, if they  meant to come?\"    \"We'll give them another quarter of an hour,\" said O'Hara. \"After that--\"    \"Sh!\" whispered Moriarty.    The door had opened. They could see a figure dimly outlined in the  semi-darkness. Footsteps passed down into the vault, and there came a  sound as if the unknown had cannoned into a chair, followed by a sharp  intake of breath, expressive of pain. A scraping sound, and a flash of  light, and part of the vault was lit by a candle. O'Hara caught a  glimpse of the unknown's face as he rose from lighting the candle, but  it was not enough to enable him to recognise him. The candle was  standing on a chair, and the light it gave was too feeble to reach the  face of any one not on a level with it.    The unknown began to drag chairs out into the neighbourhood of the  light. O'Hara counted six.    The sixth chair had scarcely been placed in position when the door  opened again. Six other figures appeared in the opening one after the  other, and bolted into the vault like rabbits into a burrow. The last  of them closed the door after them.    O'Hara nudged Moriarty, and Moriarty nudged O'Hara; but neither made a  sound. They were not likely to be seen--the blackness of the vault was  too Egyptian for that--but they were so near to the chairs that the  least whisper must have been heard. Not a word had proceeded from the  occupants of the chairs so far. If O'Hara's suspicion was correct, and  this was really the League holding a meeting, their methods were more  secret than those of any other secret society in existence. Even the  Nihilists probably exchanged a few remarks from time to time, when they  met together to plot. But these men of mystery never opened their lips.  It puzzled O'Hara.    The light of the candle was obscured for a moment, and a sound of  puffing came from the darkness.    O'Hara nudged Moriarty again.    \"Smoking!\" said the nudge.    Moriarty nudged O'Hara.    \"Smoking it is!\" was the meaning of the movement.    A strong smell of tobacco showed that the diagnosis had been a true  one. Each of the figures in turn lit his pipe at the candle, and sat  back, still in silence. It could not have been very pleasant, smoking  in almost pitch darkness, but it was breaking rules, which was probably  the main consideration that swayed the smokers. They puffed away  steadily, till the two Irishmen were wrapped about in invisible clouds.    Then a strange thing happened. I know that I am infringing copyright in  making that statement, but it so exactly suits the occurrence, that  perhaps Mr Rider Haggard will not object. It _was_ a strange thing  that happened.    A rasping voice shattered the silence.    \"You boys down there,\" said the voice, \"come here immediately. Come  here, I say.\"    It was the well-known voice of Mr Robert Dexter, O'Hara and Moriarty's  beloved house-master.    The two Irishmen simultaneously clutched one another, each afraid that  the other would think--from force of long habit--that the house-master  was speaking to him. Both stood where they were. It was the men of  mystery and tobacco that Dexter was after, they thought.    But they were wrong. What had brought Dexter to the vault was the fact  that he had seen two boys, who looked uncommonly like O'Hara and  Moriarty, go down the steps of the vault at a quarter to six. He had  been doing his usual after-lock-up prowl on the junior gravel, to  intercept stragglers, and he had been a witness--from a distance of  fifty yards, in a very bad light--of the descent into the vault. He had  remained on the gravel ever since, in the hope of catching them as they  came up; but as they had not come up, he had determined to make the  first move himself. He had not seen the six unknowns go down, for, the  evening being chilly, he had paced up and down, and they had by a lucky  accident chosen a moment when his back was turned.    \"Come up immediately,\" he repeated.    Here a blast of tobacco-smoke rushed at him from the darkness. The  candle had been extinguished at the first alarm, and he had not  realised--though he had suspected it--that smoking had been going on.    A hurried whispering was in progress among the unknowns. Apparently  they saw that the game was up, for they picked their way towards the  door.    As each came up the steps and passed him, Mr Dexter observed \"Ha!\" and  appeared to make a note of his name. The last of the six was just  leaving him after this process had been completed, when Mr Dexter  called him back.    \"That is not all,\" he said, suspiciously.    \"Yes, sir,\" said the last of the unknowns.    Neither of the Irishmen recognised the voice. Its owner was a stranger  to them.    \"I tell you it is not,\" snapped Mr Dexter. \"You are concealing the  truth from me. O'Hara and Moriarty are down there--two boys in my own  house. I saw them go down there.\"    \"They had nothing to do with us, sir. We saw nothing of them.\"    \"I have no doubt,\" said the house-master, \"that you imagine that you  are doing a very chivalrous thing by trying to hide them, but you will  gain nothing by it. You may go.\"    He came to the top of the steps, and it seemed as if he intended to  plunge into the darkness in search of the suspects. But, probably  realising the futility of such a course, he changed his mind, and  delivered an ultimatum from the top step.    \"O'Hara and Moriarty.\"    No reply.    \"O'Hara and Moriarty, I know perfectly well that you are down there.  Come up immediately.\"    Dignified silence from the vault.    \"Well, I shall wait here till you do choose to come up. You would be  well advised to do so immediately. I warn you you will not tire me  out.\"    He turned, and the door slammed behind him.    \"What'll we do?\" whispered Moriarty. It was at last safe to whisper.    \"Wait,\" said O'Hara, \"I'm thinking.\"    O'Hara thought. For many minutes he thought in vain. At last there came  flooding back into his mind a memory of the days of his faghood. It was  after that that he had been groping all the time. He remembered now.  Once in those days there had been an unexpected function in the middle of  term. There were needed for that function certain chairs. He could recall  even now his furious disgust when he and a select body of fellow fags had  been pounced upon by their form-master, and coerced into forming a line  from the junior block to the cloisters, for the purpose of handing  chairs. True, his form-master had stood ginger-beer after the event, with  princely liberality, but the labour was of the sort that gallons of  ginger-beer will not make pleasant. But he ceased to regret the episode  now. He had been at the extreme end of the chair-handling chain. He had  stood in a passage in the junior block, just by the door that led to the  masters' garden, and which--he remembered--was never locked till late at  night. And while he stood there, a pair of hands--apparently without a  body--had heaved up chair after chair through a black opening in the  floor. In other words, a trap-door connected with the vault in which  he now was.    He imparted these reminiscences of childhood to Moriarty. They set off  to search for the missing door, and, after wanderings and barkings of  shins too painful to relate, they found it. Moriarty lit a match. The  light fell on the trap-door, and their last doubts were at an end. The  thing opened inwards. The bolt was on their side, not in the passage  above them. To shoot the bolt took them one second, to climb into the  passage one minute. They stood at the side of the opening, and dusted  their clothes.    \"Bedad!\" said Moriarty, suddenly.    \"What?\"    \"Why, how are we to shut it?\"    This was a problem that wanted some solving. Eventually they managed  it, O'Hara leaning over and fishing for it, while Moriarty held his  legs.    As luck would have it--and luck had stood by them well all  through--there was a bolt on top of the trap-door, as well as  beneath it.    \"Supposing that had been shot!\" said O'Hara, as they fastened the door  in its place."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#18)"],[1,"er, is seldom accepted unless the murdered man has been  slain with a lawful weapon. Those who kill with the Dankaleh, a poisonous  juice rubbed upon meat, are always put to death by the members of their  own tribe.    [30] The Abban or protector of the Somali country is the Mogasa of the  Gallas, the Akh of El Hejaz, the Ghafir of the Sinaitic Peninsula, and the  Rabia of Eastern Arabia. It must be observed, however, that the word  denotes the protege as well as the protector; In the latter sense it is  the polite address to a Somali, as Ya Abbaneh, O Protectress, would be to  his wife.    The Abban acts at once as broker, escort, agent, and interpreter, and the  institution may be considered the earliest form of transit dues. In all  sales he receives a certain percentage, his food and lodging are provided  at the expense of his employer, and he not unfrequently exacts small  presents from his kindred. In return he is bound to arrange all  differences, and even to fight the battles of his client against his  fellow-countrymen. Should the Abban be slain, his tribe is bound to take  up the cause and to make good the losses of their protege. El Taabanah,  the office, being one of \"name,\" the eastern synonym for our honour, as  well as of lucre, causes frequent quarrels, which become exceedingly  rancorous.    According to the laws of the country, the Abban is master of the life and  property of his client. The traveller's success will depend mainly upon  his selection: if inferior in rank, the protector can neither forward nor  defend him; if timid, he will impede advance; and if avaricious, he will,  by means of his relatives, effectually stop the journey by absorbing the  means of prosecuting it. The best precaution against disappointment would  be the registering Abbans at Aden; every donkey-boy will offer himself as  a protector, but only the chiefs of tribes should be provided with  certificates. During my last visit to Africa, I proposed that English  officers visiting the country should be provided with servants not  protectors, the former, however, to be paid like the latter; all the  people recognised the propriety of the step.    In the following pages occur manifold details concerning the complicated  subject, El Taabanah.    [31] Future travellers would do well either to send before them a trusty  servant with orders to buy cattle; or, what would be better, though a  little more expensive, to take with them from Aden all the animals  required.    [32] The Somal use as camel saddles the mats which compose their huts;  these lying loose upon the animal's back, cause, by slipping backwards and  forwards, the loss of many a precious hour, and in wet weather become half  a load. The more civilised make up of canvass or \"gunny bags\" stuffed with  hay and provided with cross bars, a rude packsaddle, which is admirably  calculated to gall the animal's back. Future travellers would do well to  purchase camel-saddles at Aden, where they are cheap and well made.    [33] He received four cloths of Cutch canvass, and six others of coarse  American sheeting. At Zayla these articles are double the Aden value,  which would be about thirteen rupees or twenty-six shillings; in the bush  the price is quadrupled. Before leaving us the Abban received at least  double the original hire. Besides small presents of cloth, dates, tobacco  and rice to his friends, he had six cubits of Sauda Wilayati or English  indigo-dyed calico for women's fillets, and two of Sauda Kashshi, a Cutch  imitation, a Shukkah or half Tobe for his daughter, and a sheep for  himself, together with a large bundle of tobacco.    [34] When the pastures are exhausted and the monsoon sets in, the Bedouins  return to their cool mountains; like the Iliyat of Persia, they have their  regular Kishlakh and Yaylakh.    [35] \"Kaum\" is the Arabic, \"All\" the Somali, term for these raids.    [36] Amongst the old Egyptians the ostrich feather was the symbol of  truth. The Somal call it \"Bal,\" the Arabs \"Rish;\" it is universally used  here as the sign and symbol of victory. Generally the white feather only  is stuck in the hair; the Eesa are not particular in using black when they  can procure no other. All the clans wear it in the back hair, but each has  its own rules; some make it a standard decoration, others discard it after  the first few days. The learned have an aversion to the custom,  stigmatising it as pagan and idolatrous; the vulgar look upon it as the  highest mark of honor.    [37] This is an ancient practice in Asia as well as in Africa. The  Egyptian temples show heaps of trophies placed before the monarchs as eyes  or heads were presented in Persia. Thus in 1 Sam. xviii. 25., David brings  the spoils of 200 Philistines, and shows them in full tale to the king,  that he might be the king's son-in-law. Any work upon the subject of  Abyssinia (Bruce, book 7. chap, 8.), or the late Afghan war, will prove  that the custom of mutilation, opposed as it is both to Christianity and  El Islam, is still practised in the case of hated enemies and infidels;  and De Bey remarks of the Cape Kafirs, \"victores caesis excidunt [Greek:  _tu aidoui_], quae exsiccata regi afferunt.\"    [38] When attacking cattle, the plundering party endeavour with shoots and  noise to disperse the herds, whilst the assailants huddle them together,  and attempt to face the danger in parties.    [39] For the cheapest I paid twenty-three, for the dearest twenty-six  dollars, besides a Riyal upon each, under the names of custom dues and  carriage. The Hajj had doubtless exaggerated the price, but all were good  animals, and the traveller has no right to complain, except when he pays  dear for a bad article.          CHAP. IV.    THE SOMAL, THEIR ORIGIN AND PECULIARITIES.      Before leaving Zayla, I must not neglect a short description of its  inhabitants, and the remarkable Somal races around it.    Eastern Africa, like Arabia, presents a population composed of three  markedly distinct races.    1. The Aborigines or Hamites, such as the Negro Sawahili, the Bushmen,  Hottentots, and other races, having such physiological peculiarities as  the steatopyge, the tablier, and other developments described, in 1815, by  the great Cuvier.    2. The almost pure Caucasian of the northern regions, west of Egypt: their  immigration comes within the range of comparatively modern history.    3. The half-castes in Eastern Africa are represented principally by the  Abyssinians, Gallas, Somals, and Kafirs. The first-named people derive  their descent from Menelek, son of Solomon by the Queen of Sheba: it is  evident from their features and figures,--too well known to require  description,--that they are descended from Semitic as well as Hamitic  progenitors. [1] About the origin of the Gallas there is a diversity of  opinion. [2] Some declare them to be Meccan Arabs, who settled on the  western coast of the Red Sea at a remote epoch: according to the  Abyssinians, however, and there is little to find fault with in their  theory, the Gallas are descended from a princess of their nation, who was  given in marriage to a slave from the country south of Gurague. She bare  seven sons, who became mighty robbers and founders of tribes: their  progenitors obtained the name of Gallas, after the river Gala, in Gurague,  where they gained a decisive victory over their kinsmen the Abyssins. [3] A  variety of ethnologic and physiological reasons,--into which space and  subject prevent my entering,--argue the Kafirs of the Cape to be a  northern people, pushed southwards by some, to us, as yet, unknown cause.  The origin of the Somal is a matter of modern history.    \"Barbarah\" (Berberah) [4], according to the Kamus, is \"a well known town  in El Maghrib, and a race located between El Zanj--Zanzibar and the  Negrotic coast--and El Habash [5]: they are descended from the Himyar  chiefs Sanhaj ([Arabic]) and Sumamah ([Arabic]), and they arrived at the  epoch of the conquest of Africa by the king Afrikus (Scipio Africanus?).\"  A few details upon the subject of mutilation and excision prove these to  have been the progenitors of the Somal [6], who are nothing but a slice of  the great Galla nation Islamised and Semiticised by repeated immigrations  from Arabia. In the Kamus we also read that Samal ([Arabic]) is the name  of the father of a tribe, so called because he _thrust out_ ([Arabic],  _samala_) his brother's eye. [7] The Shaykh Jami, a celebrated  genealogist, informed me that in A.H. 666 = A.D. 1266-7, the Sayyid Yusuf  el Baghdadi visited the port of Siyaro near Berberah, then occupied by an  infidel magician, who passed through mountains by the power of his  gramarye: the saint summoned to his aid Mohammed bin Tunis el Siddiki, of  Bayt el Fakih in Arabia, and by their united prayers a hill closed upon  the pagan. Deformed by fable, the foundation of the tale is fact: the  numerous descendants of the holy men still pay an annual fine, by way of  blood-money to the family of the infidel chief. The last and most  important Arab immigration took place about fifteen generations or 450  years ago, when the Sherif Ishak bin Ahmed [8] left his native country  Hazramaut, and, with forty-four saints, before mentioned, landed on  Makhar,--the windward coast extending from Karam Harbour to Cape  Guardafui. At the town of Met, near Burnt Island, where his tomb still  exists, he became the father of all the gentle blood and the only certain  descent in the Somali country: by Magaden, a free woman, he had Gerhajis,  Awal, and Arab; and by a slave or slaves, Jailah, Sambur, and Rambad.  Hence the great clans, Habr Gerhajis and Awal, who prefer the matronymic--  Habr signifying a mother,--since, according to their dictum, no man knows  who may be his sire. [9] These increased and multiplied by connection and  affiliation to such an extent that about 300 years ago they drove their  progenitors, the Galla, from Berberah, and"]]]
