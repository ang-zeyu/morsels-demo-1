[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#18)"],[1," are defective, others [1275b] as excellent as  possible: for it is evident, that those which have many deficiencies  and degeneracies in them must be far inferior to those which are without  such faults. What I mean by degeneracies will be hereafter explained.  Hence it is clear that the office of a citizen must differ as  governments do from each other: for which reason he who is called  a citizen has, in a democracy, every privilege which that station  supposes. In other forms of government he may enjoy them; but not  necessarily: for in some states the people have no power; nor have they  any general assembly, but a few select men.    The trial also of different causes is allotted to different persons; as  at Lacedaemon all disputes concerning contracts are brought before some  of the ephori: the senate are the judges in cases of murder, and so on;  some being to be heard by one magistrate, others by another: and thus  at Carthage certain magistrates determine all causes. But our former  description of a citizen will admit of correction; for in some  governments the office of a juryman and a member of the general assembly  is not an indeterminate one; but there are particular persons appointed  for these purposes, some or all of the citizens being appointed jurymen  or members of the general assembly, and this either for all causes and  all public business whatsoever, or else for some particular one: and  this may be sufficient to show what a citizen is; for he who has a right  to a share in the judicial and executive part of government in any  city, him we call a citizen of that place; and a city, in one word, is  a collective body of such persons sufficient in themselves to all the  purposes of life.          CHAPTER II      In common use they define a citizen to be one who is sprung from  citizens on both sides, not on the father's or the mother's only. Others  carry the matter still further, and inquire how many of his ancestors  have been citizens, as his grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., but  some persons have questioned how the first of the family could prove  themselves citizens, according to this popular and careless definition.  Gorgias of Leontium, partly entertaining the same doubt, and partly in  jest, says, that as a mortar is made by a mortar-maker, so a citizen is  made by a citizen-maker, and a Larisssean by a Larisssean-maker. This  is indeed a very simple account of the matter; for if citizens are so,  according to this definition, it will be impossible to apply it to the  first founders or first inhabitants of states, who cannot possibly claim  in right either of their father or mother. It is probably a matter of  still more difficulty to determine their rights as citizens who are  admitted to their freedom after any revolution in the state. As, for  instance, at Athens, after the expulsion of the tyrants, when Clisthenes  enrolled many foreigners and city-slaves amongst the tribes; and the  doubt with respect to them was, not whether they were citizens or no,  but whether they were legally so or not. Though indeed some persons may  have this further [1276a] doubt, whether a citizen can be a citizen  when he is illegally made; as if an illegal citizen, and one who is  no citizen at all, were in the same predicament: but since we see some  persons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to govern, though not justly,  and the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices,  for such a one we have defined a citizen to be, it is evident, that a  citizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen, but whether  justly or unjustly so belongs to the former inquiry.          CHAPTER III      It has also been doubted what was and what was not the act of the city;  as, for instance, when a democracy arises out of an aristocracy or a  tyranny; for some persons then refuse to fulfil their contracts; as if  the right to receive the money was in the tyrant and not in the state,  and many other things of the same nature; as if any covenant was founded  for violence and not for the common good. So in like manner, if anything  is done by those who have the management of public affairs where a  democracy is established, their actions are to be considered as the  actions of the state, as well as in the oligarchy or tyranny.    And here it seems very proper to consider this question, When shall we  say that a city is the same, and when shall we say that it is different?    It is but a superficial mode of examining into this question to begin  with the place and the people; for it may happen that these may be  divided from that, or that some one of them may live in one place, and  some in another (but this question may be regarded as no very knotty  one; for, as a city may acquire that appellation on many accounts,  it may be solved many ways); and in like manner, when men inhabit one  common place, when shall we say that they inhabit the same city, or that  the city is the same? for it does not depend upon the walls; for I can  suppose Peloponnesus itself surrounded with a wall, as Babylon was, and  every other place, which rather encircles many nations than one city,  and that they say was taken three days when some of the inhabitants  knew nothing of it: but we shall find a proper time to determine this  question; for the extent of a city, how large it should be, and whether  it should consist of more than one people, these are particulars that  the politician should by no means be unacquainted with. This, too, is a  matter of inquiry, whether we shall say that a city is the same while  it is inhabited by the same race of men, though some of them are  perpetually dying, others coming into the world, as we say that a river  or a fountain is the same, though the waters are continually changing;  or when a revolution takes place shall we [1276b] say the men are the  same, but the city is different: for if a city is a community, it is a  community of citizens; but if the mode of government should alter, and  become of another sort, it would seem a necessary consequence that the  city is not the same; as we regard the tragic chorus as different from  the comic, though it may probably consist of the same performers: thus  every other community or composition is said to be different if the  species of composition is different; as in music the same hands produce  different harmony, as the Doric and Phrygian. If this is true, it is  evident, that when we speak of a city as being the same we refer to the  government there established; and this, whether it is called by the  same name or any other, or inhabited by the same men or different.  But whether or no it is right to dissolve the community when the  constitution is altered is another question.          CHAPTER IV      What has been said, it follows that we should consider whether the  same virtues which constitute a good man make a valuable citizen, or  different; and if a particular inquiry is necessary for this matter we  must first give a general description of the virtues of a good citizen;  for as a sailor is one of those who make up a community, so is a  citizen, although the province of one sailor may be different from  another's (for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boatswain,  and so on, each having their several appointments), it is evident that  the most accurate description of any one good sailor must refer to  his peculiar abilities, yet there are some things in which the same  description may be applied to the whole crew, as the safety of the ship  is the common business of all of them, for this is the general centre of  all their cares: so also with respect to citizens, although they may  in a few particulars be very different, yet there is one care common to  them all, the safety of the community, for the community of the citizens  composes the state; for which reason the virtue of a citizen has  necessarily a reference to the state. But if there are different sorts  of governments, it is evident that those actions which constitute the  virtue of an excellent citizen in one community will not constitute it  in another; wherefore the virtue of such a one cannot be perfect: but we  say, a man is good when his virtues are perfect; from whence it follows,  that an excellent citizen does not possess that virtue which constitutes  a good man. Those who are any ways doubtful concerning this question  may be convinced of the truth of it by examining into the best formed  states: for, if it is impossible that a city should consist entirely of  excellent citizens (while it is necessary that every one should do well  in his calling, in which consists his excellence, as it is impossible  that all the citizens should have the same [1277a] qualifications) it  is impossible that the virtue of a citizen and a good man should be the  same; for all should possess the virtue of an excellent citizen: for  from hence necessarily arise the perfection of the city: but that every  one should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible without  all the citizens in a well-regulated state were necessarily virtuous.  Besides, as a city is composed of dissimilar parts, as an animal is of  life and body; the soul of reason and appetite; a family of a man and  his wife--property of a master and a slave; in the same manner, as a  city is composed of all these and many other very different parts, it  necessarily follows that the virtue of all the citizens cannot be the  same; as the business of him who leads the band is different from the  other dancers. From all which proofs it is evident that the virtues of  a citizen cannot be one and the same. But do we never find those virtues  united which constitute a good man and excellent citizen? for we say,  such a one is an excellent magistrate and a prudent and good man; but  prudence is a necessary qualification for all those who engage in public  affairs. Nay, some persons affirm that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#18)"],[1,"a  certain air of Southern languor, rather picturesque, but perhaps not  altogether bracing. General Hunter received us, that day, with his usual  kindliness; there was a good deal of pleasant chat; Miles O'Reilly was  called in to read his latest verses; and then we came to the matter in  hand.    Jacksonville, on the St. John's River, in Florida, had been  already twice taken and twice evacuated; having been occupied by  Brigadier-General Wright, in March, 1862, and by Brigadier-General  Brannan, in October of the same year. The second evacuation was by  Major-General Hunter's own order, on the avowed ground that a garrison  of five thousand was needed to hold the place, and that this force could  not be spared. The present proposition was to take and hold it with  a brigade of less than a thousand men, carrying, however, arms and  uniforms for twice that number, and a month's rations. The claim was,  that there were fewer rebel troops in the Department than formerly,  and that the St. Mary's expedition had shown the advantage possessed by  colored troops, in local knowledge, and in the confidence of the loyal  blacks. It was also urged, that it was worth while to risk something, in  the effort to hold Florida, and perhaps bring it back into the Union.    My chief aim in the negotiation was to get the men into action, and  that of the Florida Commissioners to get them into Florida. Thus far  coinciding, we could heartily co-operate; and though General Hunter made  some reasonable objections, they were yielded more readily than I had  feared; and finally, before half our logical ammunition was exhausted,  the desired permission was given, and the thing might be considered as  done.    We were now to leave, as we supposed forever, the camp which had thus  far been our home. Our vast amount of surplus baggage made a heavy job  in the loading, inasmuch as we had no wharf, and everything had to be  put on board by means of flat-boats. It was completed by twenty-four  hours of steady work; and after some of the usual uncomfortable delays  which wait on military expeditions, we were at last afloat.    I had tried to keep the plan as secret as possible, and had requested  to have no definite orders, until we should be on board ship. But this  larger expedition was less within my own hands than was the St. Mary's  affair, and the great reliance for concealment was on certain counter  reports, ingeniously set afloat by some of the Florida men. These  reports rapidly swelled into the most enormous tales, and by the time  they reached the New York newspapers, the expedition was \"a great  volcano about bursting, whose lava will burn, flow, and destroy,\" \"the  sudden appearance in arms of no less than five thousand negroes,\"  \"a liberating host,\" \"not the phantom, but the reality, of servile  insurrection.\" What the undertaking actually was may be best seen in the  instructions which guided it.*    * HEAD-QUARTERS, BEAUFORT, S. C.,    March 5, 1863.    COLONEL,--You will please proceed with your command, the First and  Second Regiments South Carolina Volunteers, which are now embarked upon  the steamers John Adams, Boston, and Burn-side, to Fernandina, Florida.    Relying upon your military skill and judgment. I shall give you no  special directions as to your procedure after you leave Fernandina.  I expect, however, that you will occupy Jacksonville, Florida, and  intrench yourselves there.    The main objects of your expedition are to carry the proclamation of  freedom to the enslaved; to call all loyal men into the service of the  United States; to occupy as much of the State of Florida as possible  with the forces under your command; and to neglect no means consistent  with the usages of civilized warfare to weaken, harass, and annoy those  who are in rebellion against the Government of the United States.    Trusting that the blessing of our Heavenly Father will rest upon your  noble enterprise,    I am yours, sincerely,    R. SAXTON,    Brig.-Gen., Mil. Gov. Dept. of the South. Colonel Higginson, Comdg.  Expeditionary Corps.      In due time, after touching at Fernandina, we reached the difficult  bar of the St. John's, and were piloted safely over. Admiral Dupont had  furnished a courteous letter of introduction.* and we were cordially  received by Commander Duncan of the Norwich, and Lieutenant Watson,  commanding the Uncas. Like all officers on blockade duty, they were  impatient of their enforced inaction, and gladly seized the opportunity  for a different service. It was some time since they had ascended as  high as Jacksonville, for their orders were strict, one vessel's coal  was low, the other was in infirm condition, and there were rumors of  cotton-clads and torpedoes. But they gladly agreed to escort us up  the river, so soon as our own armed gunboat, the John Adams, should  arrive,--she being unaccountably delayed.    FLAG SHIP WABASH,    PORT ROYAL HARBOR, S. C., March 6, 1863. SIR,--I am informed by  Major-General Hunter that he is sending Colonel Higginson on an  important mission in the southerly part of his Department.    I have not been made acquainted with the objects of this mission, but  any assistance that you can offer Colonel Higginson, which will not  interfere with your other duties, you are authorized to give.    Respectfully your obedient servant,    S. F. DUPONT, Rear-Adm. Comdg. S. Atl. Block. Squad.    To the Senior Officer at the different Blockading Stations on the Coast  of Georgia and Florida.      We waited twenty-four hours for her, at the sultry mouth of that glassy  river, watching the great pelicans which floated lazily on its tide, or  sometimes shooting one, to admire the great pouch, into which one of  the soldiers could insert his foot, as into a boot. \"He hold one quart,\"  said the admiring experimentalist. \"Hi! boy,\" retorted another quickly,  \"neber you bring dat quart measure in _my_ peck o' corn.\" The protest  came very promptly, and was certainly fair; for the strange receptacle  would have held nearly a gallon.    We went on shore, too, and were shown a rather pathetic little garden,  which the naval officers had laid out, indulging a dream of vegetables.  They lingered over the little microscopic sprouts, pointing them out  tenderly, as if they were cradled babies. I have often noticed this  touching weakness, in gentlemen of that profession, on lonely stations.    We wandered among the bluffs, too, in the little deserted hamlet called  \"Pilot Town.\" The ever-shifting sand had in some cases almost buried  the small houses, and had swept around others a circular drift, at a few  yards' distance, overtopping then: eaves, and leaving each the untouched  citadel of this natural redoubt. There was also a dismantled lighthouse,  an object which always seems the most dreary symbol of the barbarism  of war, when one considers the national beneficence which reared and  kindled it. Despite the service rendered by this once brilliant light,  there were many wrecks which had been strown upon the beach, victims of  the most formidable of the Southern river-bars. As I stood with my foot  on the half-buried ribs of one of these vessels,--so distinctly traced  that one might almost fancy them human,--the old pilot, my companion,  told me the story of the wreck. The vessel had formerly been in the  Cuba trade; and her owner, an American merchant residing in Havana,  had christened her for his young daughter. I asked the name, and was  startled to recognize that of a favorite young cousin of mine, besides  the bones of whose representative I was thus strangely standing, upon  this lonely shore.    It was well to have something to relieve the anxiety naturally felt at  the delay of the John Adams,--anxiety both for her safety and for the  success of our enterprise, The Rebels had repeatedly threatened to  burn the whole of Jacksonville, in case of another attack, as they had  previously burned its mills and its great hotel. It seemed as if the  news of our arrival must surely have travelled thirty miles by this  time. All day we watched every smoke that rose among the wooded hills,  and consulted the compass and the map, to see if that sign announced the  doom of our expected home. At the very last moment of the tide, just  in time to cross the bar that day, the missing vessel arrived; all  anxieties vanished; I transferred my quarters on board, and at two the  next morning we steamed up the river.    Again there was the dreamy delight of ascending an unknown stream,  beneath a sinking moon, into a region where peril made fascination.  Since the time of the first explorers, I suppose that those Southern  waters have known no sensations so dreamy and so bewitching as those  which this war has brought forth. I recall, in this case, the faintest  sensations of our voyage, as Ponce de Leon may have recalled those  of his wandering search, in the same soft zone, for the secret of the  mystic fountain. I remember how, during that night, I looked for the  first time through a powerful night-glass. It had always seemed a thing  wholly inconceivable, that a mere lens could change darkness into light;  and as I turned the instrument on the preceding gunboat, and actually  discerned the man at the wheel and the others standing about him,--all  relapsing into vague gloom again at the withdrawal of the glass,--it  gave a feeling of childish delight. Yet it seemed only in keeping  with the whole enchantment of the scene; and had I been some Aladdin,  convoyed by genii or giants, I could hardly have felt more wholly a  denizen of some world of romance.    But the river was of difficult navigation; and we began to feel  sometimes, beneath the keel, that ominous, sliding, grating, treacherous  arrest of motion which makes the heart shudder, as the vessel does.  There was some solicitude about torpedoes, also,--a peril which became  a formidable thing, one year later, in the very channel where we"]]]
