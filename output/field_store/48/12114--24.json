Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#18)"],[1,"that General Halleck was  delighted with the improvements made at headquarters, both in camp  outfit and transportation, and in administration generally.  My  popularity grew as the improvements increased, but one trifling  incident came near marring it.  There was some hitch about getting  fresh beef for General Halleck's mess, and as by this time everybody  had come to look to me for anything and everything in the way of  comfort, Colonel Joe McKibben brought an order from the General for  me to get fresh beef for the headquarters mess.  I was not caterer  for this mess, nor did I belong to it even, so I refused point-blank.  McKibben, disliking to report my disobedience, undertook persuasion,  and brought Colonel Thom to see me to aid in his negotiations, but I  would not give in, so McKibben in the kindness of his heart rode  several miles in order to procure the beef himself, and thus save me  from the dire results which he thought would follow should Halleck  get wind of such downright insubordination.  The next day I was made  Commissary of Subsistence for the headquarters in addition to my  other duties, and as this brought me into the line of fresh beef,  General Halleck had no cause thereafter to complain of a scarcity of  that article in his mess.    My stay at General Halleck's headquarters was exceedingly agreeable,  and my personal intercourse with officers on duty there was not only  pleasant and instructive, but offered opportunities for improvement  and advancement for which hardly any other post could have afforded  like chances.  My special duties did not occupy all my time, and  whenever possible I used to go over to General Sherman's division,  which held the extreme right of our line in the advance on Corinth,  to witness the little engagements occurring there continuously during  the slow progress which the army was then making, the enemy being  forced back but a short distance each day.  I knew General Sherman  very well.  We came from near the same section of country in Ohio,  and his wife and her family had known me from childhood.  I was  always kindly received by the General, and one day he asked me if I  would be willing to accept the colonelcy of a certain Ohio regiment  if he secured the appointment.  I gladly told him yes, if General  Halleck would let me go; but I was doomed to disappointment, for in  about a week or so afterward General Sherman informed me that the  Governor of Ohio would not consent, having already decided to appoint  some one else.    A little later Governor Blair, of Michigan, who was with the army  temporarily in the interest of the troops from his State, and who  just at this time was looking around for a colonel for the Second  Michigan Cavalry, and very anxious to get a regular officer, fixed  upon me as the man.  The regiment was then somewhat run down by  losses from sickness, and considerably split into factions growing  out of jealousies engendered by local differences previous to  organization, and the Governor desired to bridge over all these  troubles by giving the regiment a commander who knew nothing about  them.  I presume that some one said to the Governor about this time,  \"Why don't you get Sheridan?\"  This, however, is only conjecture.  I  really do not know how my name was proposed to him, but I have often  been told since that General Gordon Granger, whom I knew slightly  then, and who had been the former colonel of the regiment, first  suggested the appointment.  At all events, on the morning of May 27,  1862, Captain Russell A. Alger--recently Governor of Michigan  --accompanied by the quartermaster of the regiment, Lieutenant Frank  Walbridge, arrived at General Halleck's headquarters and delivered to  me this telegram:    (By Telegraph.)  \"MILITARY DEPT OF MICHIGAN,  \"ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,  \"DETROIT, May 25, 1862.    GENERAL ORDERS NO. 148.    \"Captain Philip H. Sheridan, U. S. Army, is hereby appointed  Colonel of the Second Regiment Michigan Cavalry, to rank from  this date.    \"Captain Sheridan will immediately assume command of the  regiment.    \"By order of the Commander-in-Chief,  \"JNO. ROBERTSON,  \"Adjutant-General.\"      I took the order to General Halleck, and said that I would like to  accept, but he was not willing I should do so until the consent of  the War Department could be obtained.  I returned to my tent much  disappointed, for in those days, for some unaccountable reason, the  War Department did not favor the appointment of regular officers to  volunteer regiments, and I feared a disapproval at Washington.  After  a further consultation with Captain Alger and Lieutenant Walbridge, I  determined to go to the General again and further present the case.  Enlarging on my desire for active service with troops, and urging the  utter lack of such opportunity where I was, I pleaded my cause until  General Halleck finally resolved to take the responsibility of  letting me go without consulting the War Department.  When I had  thanked him for the kindness, he said that inasmuch as I was to leave  him, he would inform me that the regiment to which I had just been  appointed was ordered out as part of a column directed to make a raid  to the south of the enemy, then occupying Corinth, and that if I  could turn over my property, it would probably be well for me to join  my command immediately, so that I could go with the expedition.  I  returned to my tent, where Alger and Walbridge were still waiting,  and told them of the success of my interview, at the same time  notifying them that I would join the regiment in season to accompany  the expedition of which Halleck had spoken.    In the course of the afternoon I turned over all my property to my  successor, and about 8 o'clock that evening made my appearance at the  camp of the Second Michigan Cavalry, near Farmington, Mississippi.  The regiment was in a hubbub of excitement making preparations for  the raid, and I had barely time to meet the officers of my command,  and no opportunity at all to see the men, when the trumpet sounded to  horse.  Dressed in a coat and trousers of a captain of infantry, but  recast as a colonel of cavalry by a pair of well-worn eagles that  General Granger had kindly given me, I hurriedly placed on my saddle  a haversack, containing some coffee, sugar, bacon, and hard bread,  which had been prepared, and mounting my horse, I reported my  regiment to the brigade commander as ready for duty.          CHAPTER IX.    EXPEDITION TO BOONEVILLE--DESTROYING SUPPLIES--CONFEDERATE  STRAGGLERS--SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION--A RECONNOISSANCE--THE  IMPORTANCE OF BODILY SUSTENANCE--THE BATTLE OF BOONEVILLE  --RECOMMENDED FOR APPOINTMENT AS A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.    The expedition referred to by General Halleck in his parting  conversation was composed of the Second Michigan and Second Iowa  regiments of cavalry, formed into a brigade under command of Colonel  Washington L. Elliott, of the Second Iowa.  It was to start on the  night of the 27th of May at 12 o'clock, and proceed by a circuitous  route through Iuka, Miss., to Booneville, a station on the Mobile and  Ohio Railroad, about twenty-two miles below Corinth, and accomplish  all it could in the way of destroying the enemy's supplies and  cutting his railroad communications.    The weather in that climate was already warm, guides unobtainable,  and both men and horses suffered much discomfort from the heat, and  fatigue from the many delays growing out of the fact that we were in  almost total ignorance of the roads leading to the point that we  desired to reach.  In order that we might go light we carried only  sugar, coffee, and salt, depending on the country for meat and bread.  Both these articles were scarce, but I think we got all there was,  for our advent was so unexpected by the people of the region through  which we passed that, supposing us to be Confederate cavalry, they  often gave us all they had, the women and servants contributing most  freely from their, reserve stores.    Before reaching Booneville I had the advance, but just as we arrived  on the outskirts of the town the brigade was formed with the Second  Iowa on my right, and the whole force moved forward, right in front,  preceded by skirmishers.  Here we encountered the enemy, but forced  him back with little resistance.  When we had gained possession of  the station, Colonel Elliott directed me to take the left wing of my  regiment, pass to the south, and destroy a bridge or culvert supposed  to be at a little distance below the town on the Mobile and Ohio  Railroad.  The right wing, or other half of the regiment, was to be  held in reserve for my support if necessary.  I moved rapidly in the  designated direction till I reached the railroad, and then rode down  it for a mile and a half, but found neither bridge nor culvert.  I  then learned that there was no bridge of any importance except the  one at Baldwin, nine miles farther down, but as I was aware, from  information recently received, that it was defended by three  regiments and a battery, I concluded that I could best accomplish the  purpose for which I had been detached--crippling the road--by tearing  up the track, bending the rails, and burning the cross-ties.  This  was begun with alacrity at four different points, officers and men  vieing with one another in the laborious work of destruction.  We had  but few tools, and as the difficulties to overcome were serious, our  progress was slow, until some genius conceived the idea that the  track, rails and ties, might be lifted from its bed bodily, turned  over, and subjected to a high heat; a convenient supply of dry  fence-rails would furnish ample fuel to render the rails useless.  In this way a good deal of the track was effectively broken up, and  communication by rail from Corinth to the south entirely cut off.  While we were still busy in wrecking the road, a dash was made at my  right and rear by a squadron"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#18)"],[1,"nd, the  gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only  kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as  public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty,  indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and  useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however,  where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed  with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders  by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative  constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a  blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the  appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of this  fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof  the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of  the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its  worthiest individuals and periods.    200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with  one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his  body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts  and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom  at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an  average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is  IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character  of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean  or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of  undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the \"Sabbath of  Sabbaths,\" to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine,  who was himself such a man.--Should, however, the contrariety and  conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus  to life--and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and  irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated  into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict  with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and  self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and  inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering  and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades  and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans  according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and  among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the  same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes  to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring  from the same causes.    201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only  gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only  kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in  what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be  no \"morality of love to one's neighbour.\" Granted even that there is  already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,  gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition  of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly  distinguished by honourable names as \"virtues,\" and eventually almost  coincide with the conception \"morality\": in that period they do not  as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still  ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good  nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should  it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this  praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared  with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES  PUBLICA. After all, \"love to our neighbour\" is always a secondary  matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to  our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the  whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this  fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral  valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of  enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and  love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the  point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than  those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they  were perpetually required in the common danger against the common  enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when  the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral  and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now  attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its  conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or  to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a  disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here  again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest  instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual  far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious  conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its  belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these  very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent  spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are  felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the  herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called  EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing  disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and  honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always  less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity  and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins  to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and  self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\"  and still more \"the sheep,\" wins respect. There is a point of diseased  mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society  itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL,  and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it  to be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of \"punishment\" and  \"the obligation to punish\" are then painful and alarming to people. \"Is  it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we  still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!\"--with these questions  gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate  conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear,  one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it  would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer  necessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European,  will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds  and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd \"we wish  that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!\" Some time  or other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called \"progress\" all  over Europe.    202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred  times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OUR  truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one  plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will  be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to  men of \"modern ideas\" that we have constantly applied the terms \"herd,\"  \"herd-instincts,\" and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot  do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We  have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become  unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence  prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he  did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to  teach--they \"know\" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard  and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which  here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise  and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human  animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more  to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts,  according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance  of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS  HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter,  only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after  which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or  should be possible. Against such a \"possibility,\" against such a \"should  be,\" however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it  says obstinately and inexorably \"I am morality itself and nothing else  is morality!\" Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured  and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have  reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of  this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC  movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO,  however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for  those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated  by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised  teeth-gnashing of the anarchist"]]]
