Their difficulties have arisen after this  admission, from the differences in the appearance which one physical  object presents to two people at the same time, or to one person at two  times between which it cannot be supposed to have changed. Such  difficulties have made people doubtful how far objective reality could  be known by sense at all, and have made them suppose that there were  positive arguments against the view that it can be so known. Our  hypothetical construction meets these arguments, and shows that the  account of the world given by common sense and physical science can be  interpreted in a way which is logically unobjectionable, and finds a  place for all the data, both hard and soft. It is this hypothetical  construction, with its reconciliation of psychology and physics, which  is the chief outcome of our discussion. Probably the construction is  only in part necessary as an initial assumption, and can be obtained  from more slender materials by the logical methods of which we shall  have an example in the definitions of points, instants, and particles;  but I do not yet know to what lengths this diminution in our initial  assumptions can be carried.          LECTURE IV    THE WORLD OF PHYSICS AND THE WORLD OF SENSE      Among the objections to the reality of objects of sense, there is one  which is derived from the apparent difference between matter as it  appears in physics and things as they appear in sensation. Men of  science, for the most part, are willing to condemn immediate data as  \"merely subjective,\" while yet maintaining the truth of the physics  inferred from those data. But such an attitude, though it may be  _capable_ of justification, obviously stands in need of it; and the only  justification possible must be one which exhibits matter as a logical  construction from sense-data--unless, indeed, there were some wholly _a  priori_ principle by which unknown entities could be inferred from such  as are known. It is therefore necessary to find some way of bridging the  gulf between the world of physics and the world of sense, and it is this  problem which will occupy us in the present lecture. Physicists appear  to be unconscious of the gulf, while psychologists, who are conscious of  it, have not the mathematical knowledge required for spanning it. The  problem is difficult, and I do not know its solution in detail. All that  I can hope to do is to make the problem felt, and to indicate the kind  of methods by which a solution is to be sought.    Let us begin by a brief description of the two contrasted worlds. We  will take first the world of physics, for, though the other world is  given while the physical world is inferred, to us now the world of  physics is the more familiar, the world of pure sense having become  strange and difficult to rediscover. Physics started from the  common-sense belief in fairly permanent and fairly rigid bodies--tables  and chairs, stones, mountains, the earth and moon and sun. This  common-sense belief, it should be noticed, is a piece of audacious  metaphysical theorising; objects are not continually present to  sensation, and it may be doubted whether they are there when they are  not seen or felt. This problem, which has been acute since the time of  Berkeley, is ignored by common sense, and has therefore hitherto been  ignored by physicists. We have thus here a first departure from the  immediate data of sensation, though it is a departure merely by way of  extension, and was probably made by our savage ancestors in some very  remote prehistoric epoch.    But tables and chairs, stones and mountains, are not _quite_ permanent  or _quite_ rigid. Tables and chairs lose their legs, stones are split by  frost, and mountains are cleft by earthquakes and eruptions. Then there  are other things, which seem material, and yet present almost no  permanence or rigidity. Breath, smoke, clouds, are examples of such  things--so, in a lesser degree, are ice and snow; and rivers and seas,  though fairly permanent, are not in any degree rigid. Breath, smoke,  clouds, and generally things that can be seen but not touched, were  thought to be hardly real; to this day the usual mark of a ghost is that  it can be seen but not touched. Such objects were peculiar in the fact  that they seemed to disappear completely, not merely to be transformed  into something else. Ice and snow, when they disappear, are replaced by  water; and it required no great theoretical effort to invent the  hypothesis that the water was the same thing as the ice and snow, but in  a new form. Solid bodies, when they break, break into parts which are  practically the same in shape and size as they were before. A stone can  be hammered into a powder, but the powder consists of grains which  retain the character they had before the pounding. Thus the ideal of  absolutely rigid and absolutely permanent bodies, which early physicists  pursued throughout the changing appearances, seemed attainable by  supposing ordinary bodies to be composed of a vast number of tiny atoms.  This billiard-ball view of matter dominated the imagination of  physicists until quite modern times, until, in fact, it was replaced by  the electromagnetic theory, which in its turn is developing into a new  atomism. Apart from the special form of the atomic theory which was  invented for the needs of chemistry, some kind of atomism dominated the  whole of traditional dynamics, and was implied in every statement of its  laws and axioms.    The pictorial accounts which physicists give of the material world as  they conceive it undergo violent changes under the influence of  modifications in theory which are much slighter than the layman might  suppose from the alterations of the description. Certain features,  however, have remained fairly stable. It is always assumed that there is  _something_ indestructible which is capable of motion in space; what is  indestructible is always very small, but does not always occupy a mere  point in space. There is supposed to be one all-embracing space in which  the motion takes place, and until lately we might have assumed one  all-embracing time also. But the principle of relativity has given  prominence to the conception of \"local time,\" and has somewhat  diminished men's confidence in the one even-flowing stream of time.  Without dogmatising as to the ultimate outcome of the principle of  relativity, however, we may safely say, I think, that it does not  destroy the possibility of correlating different local times, and does  not therefore have such far-reaching philosophical consequences as is  sometimes supposed. In fact, in spite of difficulties as to measurement,  the one all-embracing time still, I think, underlies all that physics  has to say about motion. We thus have still in physics, as we had in  Newton's time, a set of indestructible entities which may be called  particles, moving relatively to each other in a single space and a  single time.    The world of immediate data is quite different from this. Nothing is  permanent; even the things that we think are fairly permanent, such as  mountains, only become data when we see them, and are not immediately  given as existing at other moments. So far from one all-embracing space  being given, there are several spaces for each person, according to the  different senses which give relations that may be called spatial.  Experience teaches us to obtain one space from these by correlation, and  experience, together with instinctive theorising, teaches us to  correlate our spaces with those which we believe to exist in the  sensible worlds of other people. The construction of a single time  offers less difficulty so long as we confine ourselves to one person's  private world, but the correlation of one private time with another is a  matter of great difficulty. Thus, apart from any of the fluctuating  hypotheses of physics, three main problems arise in connecting the world  of physics with the world of sense, namely (1) the construction of  permanent \"things,\" (2) the construction of a single space, and (3) the  construction of a single time. We will consider these three problems in  succession.    (1) The belief in indestructible \"things\" very early took the form of  atomism. The underlying motive in atomism was not, I think, any  empirical success in interpreting phenomena, but rather an instinctive  belief that beneath all the changes of the sensible world there must be  something permanent and unchanging. This belief was, no doubt, fostered  and nourished by its practical successes, culminating in the  conservation of mass; but it was not produced by these successes. On the  contrary, they were produced by it. Philosophical writers on physics  sometimes speak as though the conservation of something or other were  essential to the possibility of science, but this, I believe, is an  entirely erroneous opinion. If the _a priori_ belief in permanence had  not existed, the same laws which are now formulated in terms of this  belief might just as well have been formulated without it. Why should we  suppose that, when ice melts, the water which replaces it is the same  thing in a new form? Merely because this supposition enables us to state  the phenomena in a way which is consonant with our prejudices. What we  really know is that, under certain conditions of temperature, the  appearance we call ice is replaced by the appearance we call water. We  can give laws according to which the one appearance will be succeeded by  the other, but there is no reason except prejudice for regarding both as  appearances of the same substance.    One task, if what has just been said is correct, which confronts us in  trying to connect the world of sense with the world of physics, is the  task of reconstructing the conception of matter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#18)"],[1,"severe if one will be guided entirely by the advice  of the inhabitants of the region, especially as to his clothing and  general outfit. I feel certain that, if one goes to the right locality,  not only will he get good sport, but he will get it under very pleasant  and novel conditions, and return home more benefited in every way than  if he had taken a trip of the same duration to some warm climate. Under  no circumstances, however, let him imagine that he knows more than the  people of the country as to what he should do and wear.    _D. M. Barringer._          [Illustration: OUTESHAI, RUSSIAN BARZOI.]    Wolf-Hunting in Russia      The enormous extent and diversified conditions of the various localities  of this empire would naturally suggest a variety of sport in hunting and  shooting, including perhaps something characteristic. In the use of dogs  of the chase especially is this suggestion borne out by the facts, and  it has been said that in no other country has the systematic working  together of fox-hounds and greyhounds been successfully carried out.    Unfortunately, this sort of hunting is not now so general as prior to  the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. A modest kennel for such sport  consists of six to ten fox-hounds and four to six pairs of barzois,[1]  and naturally demands considerable attention. Moreover, to use it  requires the presence of at least one man with the fox-hounds and one  man for each pair or each three greyhounds. To have a sufficient number  of good huntsmen at his service was formerly a much less expensive  luxury to a proprietor than now, and to this fact is due the decline of  the combined kennel in Russia.      [1] Barzoi--long-haired greyhound, wolf-hound, Russian greyhound.    This hunt is more or less practised throughout the entire extent of the  Russian Empire. In the south, where the soil is not boggy, it is far  better sport than in Northern Russia, where there are such enormous  stretches of marshy woods and tundra. Curiously enough, nearly all the  game of these northern latitudes, including moose, wolves, hares, and  nearly all kinds of grouse and other birds, seem to be found in the  marshiest places--those almost impracticable to mounted hunters.    Though the distances covered in hunting, and also in making neighborly  visits in Russia, are vast, often recalling our own broad Western life,  yet in few other respects are any similarities to be traced. This is  especially true of Russia north of the Moscow parallel; for in the south  the steppes have much in common with the prairies, though more  extensive, and the semi-nomadic Cossacks, in their mounted  peregrinations and in their pastoral life, have many traits in common  with real Americans. Nor is it true of the Caucasus, where it would seem  that the Creator, dissatisfied with the excess of the great plain,[2]  extending from the Finnish Gulf to the Black Sea, resolved to establish  a counterpoise, and so heaved up the gigantic Caucasus. There too are to  be found fine hunting and shooting, which merit description and which  offer good sport to mountain amateurs.      [2] The Waldeir hills, extending east and west half-way between St.    Petersburg and Moscow, are the only exception.    The annual hunt in the fall of 1893 in the governments of Tver and  Yaroslav, with the Gatchino kennels, will give a good idea of the  special sport of which I have spoken. It is imperative that these hounds  go to the hunt once a year for about a month, although for the most part  without their owner. The master of the hunt and his assistant, with  three or four guests, and oftentimes the proprietors of the lands where  the hounds happen to hunt, usually constitute the party. The hunt  changes locality nearly every year, but rarely does it go further from  home than on this occasion, about 450 versts from Gatchino. As a rule it  is not difficult to obtain from proprietors permission to hunt upon  their estates, and this is somewhat surprising to one who has seen the  freedom with which the fences are torn down and left unrepaired. It is  true that they are not of the strongest and best type, and that peasant  labor is still very cheap; yet such concessions to sport would rarely be  made in America.    It was at Gatchino, on the 10th day of September, that the hunting train  was loaded with men, horses, dogs, provisions and wagons. The hunt  called for twenty-two cars in all, including one second-class passenger  car, in one end of which four of us made ourselves comfortable, while in  the other end servants found places. The weather was cold and rainy,  and, as our train traveled as a freight, we had two nights before us. It  was truly a picturesque and rare sight to see a train of twenty-two cars  loaded with the _personnel_, material and live stock of a huge kennel.  The fox-hounds, seventy in number, were driven down in perfect, close  order by the beaters to the cracks of the Russian hunting whip and  installed in their car, which barely offered them sufficient  accommodation. The greyhounds, three sorts, sixty-seven in number, were  brought down on leashes by threes, fours or fives, and loaded in two  cars. Sixty saddle and draft horses, with saddles, wagons and hunting  paraphernalia, were also loaded. Finally the forty-four gray and green  uniformed huntsmen, beaters, drivers and ourselves were ready, and the  motley train moved away amid the uttered and unuttered benedictions of  the families and relatives of the parting hunt.    Our first destination was Peschalkino, in the government of Tver, near  the River Leet, a tributary of the Volga, not far from the site of the  first considerable check of the Mongolian advance about 1230. I mention  this fact in passing to give some idea of the _terrain_, because I think  that it is evident to anyone who has visited this region that the  difficulty of provisioning and of transportation in these marshes must  have offered a greater obstacle to an invading army than did the then  defenders of their country.    We passed our time most agreeably in playing vint[3] and talking of  hunting incidents along the route. Many interesting things were told  about the habits of wolves and other game, and, as they were vouched for  by two thorough gentlemen and superb sportsmen, and were verified as far  as a month's experience in the field would permit, I feel authorized to  cite them as facts.      [3] Vint--game of cards resembling whist, boaston and _preference_.    The bear has been called in folk-lore the moujik's brother, and it must  be conceded that there are outward points of resemblance, especially  when each is clad in winter attire; moreover the moujik, when all is  snow and ice, fast approximates the hibernating qualities of the bear.  One strong point of difference is the accentuated segregative character  of the former, who always live in long cabin villages.[4]      [4] The bear is caricatured in Russian publications as a humorous,    light-hearted, joking creature, conversing and making common sport    with the golden-hearted moujik, his so-called brother.    But it is rather of the wolf's habits and domestic economy that I wish  to speak--of him who has always been the dreaded and accursed enemy of  the Russian peasant. In the question of government the wolf follows very  closely the system of the country, which is pre-eminently  patriarchal--the fundamental principle of the _mir_. A family of wolves  may vary in number from six to twenty, and contain two to four  generations, usually two or three, yet there is always one chief and one  wife--in other words, never more than one female with young ones. When  larger packs have been seen together it was probably the temporary  marshaling of their forces for some desperate raid or the preliminaries  of an anarchistic strike. The choruses of wolves and the special  training of the young for them are interesting characteristics. Upon  these choruses depends the decision of the hunter whether or not to make  his final attack upon the stronghold of the wolves; by them he can tell  with great precision the number in the family and the ages of the  different members. They are to wolf-hunters what tracks are to moose- and  bear-hunters--they serve to locate the game. When the family is at home  they occur with great regularity at twilight, midnight and dawn.    In camp near Billings, Montana, in the fall of 1882, we heard nightly  about 12 o'clock the howling of a small pack of coyotes; but we supposed  that it was simply a \"howling protest\" against the railway train,  passing our camp at midnight, that had just reached that part of the  world. Possibly our coyotes have also howling choruses at regular  intervals, like the Russian wolves.    There was such a fascination in listening to the wolves that we went out  several times solely for that purpose. The weirdness of the sound and  the desolateness of the surroundings produced peculiar sensations upon  the listener. To an enthusiastic lover of sport and nature these  pleasurable sensations might be well compared with the effect of the  Niebelungen songs upon an ardent Wagnerite. The old professional  huntsmen could tell just what members of the family and how many were  howling; they scarcely disagreed upon these points.    These old hunters pretended to interpret the noisy assemblies of the  wolves as regards content or discontent, satisfaction or  dissatisfaction.    Owing to the difficulty of securing wolves under most favorable  circumstances, especially old ones, it would be considered folly to make  a drive if the matinal howl had not been heard. But to make a successful  drive in a large marshy forest many beaters must be employed, and, as  they are gathered from far and near, considerable time is necessary to  collect them; therefore it is almost essential to know that the wolves  were \"at home\" at midnight as well as dawn.
