Now I repeat--the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, he constitutes  the third person in the Trinity, the Godhead. The gift or presentation  of the Holy Ghost is the authoritative act of conferring him upon man.  The Holy Ghost in person may visit men and will visit those who are  worthy and bear witness to their spirit of God and Christ, but may not  tarry with them. The Spirit of God which emanates from Deity may be  likened to electricity, or the universal ether, as explained in our  manual, which fills the earth and the air, and is everywhere present.  It is the power of God, the influence that he exerts throughout all  his works by which he can effect his purposes and execute his will, in  consonance with the laws of free agency which he has conferred upon  man. By means of this Spirit every man is enlightened, the {75} wicked  as well as the good, the intelligent and the ignorant, the high and  the low, each in accordance with his capacity to receive the light;  and this Spirit or influence which emanates from God may be said to  constitute man's consciousness, and will never cease to strive with  man, until man is brought to the possession of the higher intelligence  which can only come through faith, repentance, baptism for the  remission of sins, and the gift or the presentation of the Holy Ghost  by one having authority.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 12, p. 389, March,  1909.    GOD INSPIRES MAN TO KNOW AND TO DO. I am inclined to acknowledge the  hand of God in all things. If I see a man inspired with intelligence,  with extraordinary ability and wisdom, I say to myself he is indebted  to God for that wisdom and ability; and that, without the providence  or interposition of the Almighty, he would not have been what he is.  He is indebted to the Lord Almighty for his intelligence, and for all  that he has; for the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof. God  originated and designed all things, and all are his children. We are  born into the world as his offspring; endowed with the same attributes.  The children of men have sprung from the Almighty, whether the world is  willing to acknowledge it or not. He is the Father of our spirits. He  is the originator of our earthly tabernacles. We live and move and have  our being in God our heavenly Father. And having sprung from him with  our talents, our ability, our wisdom, we should at least be willing  to acknowledge his hand in all the prosperity that may attend us in  life, and give to him the honor and glory of all we accomplish in the  flesh. We are particularly dependent upon the Almighty for everything  we possess of a worldly character. There is not a man on the earth  possessed of the wisdom or power of himself to cause even a spear of  grass to grow, or to produce a kernel of wheat or of corn, or any  fruit, vegetable, or any material whatever which is essential for the  {76} sustenance, the happiness and the well-being of a human creature  in the world. It is true we can go to the earth, we find it prepared  to a certain extent, and we cultivate, plow and plant, and we reap the  harvest; but God has ordained that the fruits of our labor shall be in  subjection and in obedience to certain laws which he himself controls,  and which he has kept out of the power of man. Man may boast of having  a great deal of wisdom; of having accomplished a great deal in this  nineteenth century; but, if he did but know it, he derives the ability  by which he accomplishes these things from God his Father, who is in  heaven. He does not possess the power in and of himself.    I read a Scripture something like this: that \"there is a spirit in  man.\" Now, if that should stop here, there would not be perhaps  anything very remarkable about man; for the spirit of man knoweth only  the things of man, and the things of God are discerned by the Spirit of  God. But while there is a spirit in man, it is further stated that \"the  inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.\" There is not a  man born into the world, but has a portion of the Spirit of God, and it  is that Spirit of God which gives to his spirit understanding. Without  this, he would be but an animal like the rest of the brute creation,  without understanding, without judgment, without skill, without  ability, except to eat and to drink like the brute beast. But inasmuch  as the Spirit of God giveth all men understanding, he is enlightened  above the brute beast. He is made in the image of God himself, so that  he can reason, reflect, pray, exercise faith; he can use his energies  for the accomplishment of the desires of his heart, and inasmuch as he  puts forth his efforts in the proper direction, then he is entitled  to an increased portion of the Spirit of the Almighty to inspire him  to increased intelligence, to increased prosperity and happiness in  the world; but in proportion as he prostitutes his energies for evil,  the inspiration of the Almighty is withdrawn from {77} him, until he  becomes so dark and so benighted, that so far as his knowledge of God  is concerned, he is quite as ignorant as a dumb brute.    Again, where are we going? We come here and journey in the flesh a  little season, and then we pass away. Every soul that is born into the  world will die. There is not a soul that has escaped death, except  those upon whom God has passed, by the power of his Spirit, that they  should live in the flesh until the second coming of the Son of Man; but  they will eventually have to pass through the ordeal called death; it  may be in the twinkling of an eye, and without pain or suffering; but  they will pass through the change, because it is an irrevocable edict  of the Almighty. \"In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely  die.\" This was the edict of the Almighty, and it pertains to Adam--that  is, all the human race--for Adam is many, and it means you and me and  every soul that lives and that bears the image of the Father. We shall  all die. But is that the end of our being? If we had an existence  before we came here, we certainly shall continue that existence when  we leave here. The spirit will continue to exist as it did before,  with the additional advantages derived from having passed through this  probation. It is absolutely necessary that we should come to the earth  and take upon us tabernacles; because if we did not have tabernacles  we could not be like God, nor like Jesus Christ. God has a tabernacle  of flesh and bone. He is an organized being just as we are, who are  now in the flesh. Jesus Christ was born of his mother, Mary. He had a  fleshly tabernacle. He was crucified on the cross; and his body was  raised from the dead. He burst the bonds of the grave, and came forth  to newness of life, a living soul, a living being, a man with a body,  with parts and with spirit--the spirit and the body becoming a living  and immortal soul. You and I have to do the same thing. We must go  through the same ordeal in order to attain to the glory and exaltation  which God designed {78} we should enjoy with him in the eternal worlds.  In other words, we must become like him; peradventure to sit upon  thrones, to have dominion, power and eternal increase. God designed  this in the beginning. We are the children of God. He is an eternal  being, without beginning of days or end of years. He always was, he is,  he always will be. We are precisely in the same condition and under the  same circumstances that God our heavenly Father was when he was passing  through this, or a similar ordeal. We are destined to come forth out of  the grave as Jesus did, and to obtain immortal bodies as he did--that  is, that our tabernacles are to become immortal as his became immortal,  that the spirit and the body may be joined together and become one  living being, indivisible, inseparable, eternal. This is the object  of our existence in the world; and we can only attain to these things  through obedience to certain principles, through walking in certain  channels, through obtaining certain information, certain intelligence  from God, without which no man can accomplish his work or fulfill  the mission he has come upon the earth to fulfill. These principles  are the principles of the gospel of eternal truth, the principles of  faith, repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, the principle  of obedience to God the eternal Father; for obedience is one of the  first principles or laws of heaven. Without obedience, there can be no  order, no government, no union, no plan or purpose carried out. And  that obedience must be voluntary; it must not be forced, there must be  no coercion. Men must not be constrained against their will to obey  the will of God; they must obey it because they know it to be right,  because they desire to do it, and because it is their pleasure to do  it. God delights in the willing heart.    I am looking forward to the time when I shall have passed away from  this stage of existence, there I shall be permitted to enjoy more fully  every gift and blessing that has {79} contributed to my happiness in  this world; everything. I do not believe that there is one thing that  was designed or intended to give me joy or make me happy, that I shall  be denied here after, provided I continue faithful; otherwise my joy  cannot be full. I am not now speaking of that happiness or pleasure  that is derived from sin; I refer to the happiness experienced in  seeking to do the will of God on earth as it is done in heaven.

The great object, therefore, of the splendid rush was defeated, but  ten prisoners were secured, together with thirty-five rounds of  ammunition for the defunct Long Tom. Two of the British party were  wounded. While proceeding to search for further spoil, 100,000 rounds  of Martini-Henry ammunition were unearthed at a neighbouring farm and  destroyed. Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, under Colonels Colenbrander  and Wilson, were now ever on the move, and, working from Bergvlei as  a centre, were continually bringing in wandering Boers. A detachment  of the 12th Mounted Infantry under Major Thomson, too, did splendid  work, and succeeded, in the midst of a dense fog, in capturing  Commandant Marais and forty of his followers.    Beyers, who had fled from Pietersburg on the approach of the British,  was still at large, however, and in the Waterberg district was doing  his best to intercept such commandos as were on the way to surrender.  Munnik, a former landdrost of Pietersburg, and somewhat of a  firebrand, together with his son, an ex-state mining engineer, had  been captured during General Plumer's march, by Major Kirkwood and the  Wiltshire Regiment.    The total \"bag\" made by Colonel Grenfell, during his move from  Pietersburg till his return there on the 6th of May, was 129  prisoners, fifty voluntary surrenders, and 240,000 rounds of  ammunition, which were destroyed. Seven Boers were killed.    On 10th May Botha forwarded to Lord Kitchener another letter:--         \"As I have already assured your Excellency, I am very desirous       of terminating this war and its sad consequences. It is,       however, necessary, in order to comply with the Grondwet of       this Republic and otherwise, that, before any steps are taken       in that direction, the condition of our country and our cause       be brought to the notice of his Honour State President Kruger       in Europe; and I therefore wish to send two persons to him in       order to acquaint him fully with that condition. As speed in       this matter is of great consequence to both contending parties,       and as such despatch without your Excellency's assistance would       take a considerable time, I should like to hear from your       Excellency whether your Excellency is prepared to assist me in       expediting this matter by allowing such person or persons to       journey there and back unhindered, if necessary by the traffic       medium within your Excellency's control.\"    On 16th May Lord Kitchener replied to the application as follows:--         \"I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Honour's       letter of the 10th instant, and, in reply, beg to state that I       can only deal with you and your superior officers in the field       in regard to the cessation of hostilities, and that I do not       recognise the official status of any other persons in the late       Republics of the Orange River and Transvaal. If, however, your       Honour desires, with the object of bringing hostilities to a       close, to consult with any person in Europe I will forward any       telegram your Honour desires on the subject and let you have       the reply. Should, however, your Honour still desire to send       messengers, and will inform me of their names and status, I       will refer the matter to his Majesty's Government for       decision.\"          CHAPTER VI    GENERAL ELLIOT'S OPERATIONS FROM KROONSTAD      It will be remembered that during the middle of March Lord Kitchener  engaged himself with a new scheme of redistribution, and that General  Elliot's force was arranged to operate from Kroonstad in the northern  district of the Orange River Colony. By the 10th of April this force  was ready to take the field. In consequence of a seeming recrudescence  of activity of the enemy in the north-west of the Colony, and certain  signs of a possible junction between them and their confederates of  the south-west of the Transvaal, General Elliot directed his energies  to the sweeping of the district about Reitzburg and Parys. Here  supplies in some quantities served as an attraction to the hungry  commandos. These were satisfactorily disposed of by the 20th of April,  when the force returned to Kroonstad.    But it remained not long idle. General Elliot proceeded to scour the  districts beyond the Wilge River, where the Dutchmen were again  beginning to hoard their goods for further activity. Lord Kitchener's  plan was as follows:--A movement was to be made by parallel columns on  a wide front eastward beyond Heilbron; the left or northern column,  when past that point, was to halt, while the other columns wheeling to  the left should clear the country, the right passing east of  Frankfort. The whole division, moving north in line, was then to press  the Boers and their stock back on the Vaal River.    In order to drive as many dispersed Boers as possible into General  Elliot's net, General C. Knox, concurrently with General Elliot's  first move, was to send a column towards Reitz. A force was also  stationed on the north under Colonel Western, who had succeeded to the  command of Lieutenant-Colonel Williams' column on the lower drifts of  the Wilge River. At the same time the columns of Colonels E. Knox and  Rimington were to move from Heidelberg and Standerton respectively  towards the junction of the Vaal and Waterval Rivers.    In accordance with this scheme, General C. Knox occupied Senekal on  the 25th of April, sending, as directed, Colonel Pilcher (who had been  doing magnificent work at Clocolan, Mequatting's Nek, and the  Korannaberg) to Reitz on the 28th. The town was found to have been  evacuated on the previous evening, and report spoke to General  Elliot's presence on the north of it: consequently, Colonel Pilcher's  part in the scheme being accomplished, he rejoined General Knox at  Senekal, and with him moved to the railway.    General Elliot's force at this time was moving east, and by the 7th of  May the troops were disposed along the line Villiersdorp-Frankfort-Tafel  Kop. On the 9th the General, who was at Cornelia, despatched a force to  Vrede, and sent off forty prisoners, 5000 horses, and a large number of  waggons and cattle to Standerton. The Boers (since Colonel Western was  guarding the Wilge River Drift) were now threatened on all sides. Flying  in despair to the hilly cover south of Greylingstad, they jumped into  the open arms of Colonels E. Knox and Rimington, who were lying in wait  for them. Those who were smart enough to escape scurried across the  river, but 34 prisoners, 4000 cattle, 284 waggons and carts, and 5400  rounds of ammunition were secured, and the haul served as a successful  finale to the first phase of these well-directed operations.    Colonel Western's share in the movement being completed, he went from  the Wilge River Drifts to Heilbron. Here he became aware that  Steenkamp's laagers were situated some seventeen miles to north of  him. Quick as lightning he was off again, marching stealthily by night  in the direction of the quarry, and rushing the camp at dawn on the  9th of May. It was a splendidly conceived and splendidly executed  affair, and thirty-two prisoners, with horses, waggons, and carts,  were the prize of the undertaking.    June opened with more dexterous swoops, and after clearing the ground  from Vereeniging to Parys, and thoroughly sweeping Venterskroom and  Vredefort, the force returned eastward to the rail, bringing with them  nine prisoners, 16,000 rounds of ammunition, and many waggons. After  refitting at Rhenoster, Colonel Western scoured the country between  the junction of the Vaal and Rhenoster Rivers and Coal Mine Drift, but  the enemy vanished, having now every reason to reserve their  ammunition, or to spend it only on forces inferior to their own in  number. They were not in all cases successful in their disappearance,  for a convoy was caught on the 23rd of June, and the guerillas had to  fight for dear life; six prisoners and all the waggons and stock were  captured. Colonel Western then marched to Klerksdorp to replenish his  supplies, after which he co-operated with General Gilbert Hamilton and  Colonel Allenby--attacked the enemy in the mountain fastnesses of  Hartebeestefontein, and captured more prisoners, horses, and rifles.  He finished up the month by moving towards Hoopstad to meet Colonel  Henry's column, on its way from Christiana, hustling Boers wherever  he found them, and then returning to Klerksdorp, plus six prisoners,  thirteen rifles, seventy-one horses, fifteen waggons and carts. Two  Boers were killed.      GENERAL ELLIOT'S OPERATIONS--SECOND PHASE    General Elliot, his left column following the course of the Klip  River, his right extended to the south (beyond Vrede), meanwhile  marched towards the Natal border. At the same time Colonel Colville's  force moved up the right bank of the Klip River on General Elliot's  left, searching the country around Verzammelberg. Troops from General  Hildyard's force were posted to close Almond's (or Alleman's) Nek and  guard Botha's and Muller's Passes. Beyond an engagement with some 300  of the foe, who were found on his right flank some twenty miles below  Vrede, General Elliot met with slight opposition. He reached Botha's  Pass on the 19th of May, and forwarded to Natal some 2000 horses and  stock, the fruits of his labours since leaving the Vaal.    The Boers by this time had found for themselves a new and naturally  strong position some twenty-five miles to the south, and from this  rugged and honeycombed region it was imperative to rout them. On the  21st they were attacked and without much difficulty driven off, as  their resistance was mainly intended to cause a diversion while their  convoy got away in safety to the cover of the broken country along the  banks of the Wilge River. General Elliot, accompanied by "]]]
