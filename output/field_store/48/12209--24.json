However, he said, \"I've sold the  presentation of the living, Hodson; none of that breed shall get it, I  war'nt\"; and Mr. Hodson said he was quite right: and I have no doubt  from this that the two brothers are at variance--as brothers often are,  and sisters too.  Don't you remember the two Miss Scratchleys at  Chiswick, how they used always to fight and quarrel--and Mary Box, how  she was always thumping Louisa?    Presently, seeing two little boys gathering sticks in the wood, Mr.  Hodson jumped out of the carriage, at Sir Pitt's order, and rushed upon  them with his whip.  \"Pitch into 'em, Hodson,\" roared the baronet;  \"flog their little souls out, and bring 'em up to the house, the  vagabonds; I'll commit 'em as sure as my name's Pitt.\" And presently we  heard Mr. Hodson's whip cracking on the shoulders of the poor little  blubbering wretches, and Sir Pitt, seeing that the malefactors were in  custody, drove on to the hall.    All the servants were ready to meet us, and . . .    Here, my dear, I was interrupted last night by a dreadful thumping at  my door: and who do you think it was? Sir Pitt Crawley in his night-cap  and dressing-gown, such a figure! As I shrank away from such a visitor,  he came forward and seized my candle.  \"No candles after eleven  o'clock, Miss Becky,\" said he.  \"Go to bed in the dark, you pretty  little hussy\" (that is what he called me), \"and unless you wish me to  come for the candle every night, mind and be in bed at eleven.\" And  with this, he and Mr. Horrocks the butler went off laughing.  You may  be sure I shall not encourage any more of their visits.  They let loose  two immense bloodhounds at night, which all last night were yelling and  howling at the moon.  \"I call the dog Gorer,\" said Sir Pitt; \"he's  killed a man that dog has, and is master of a bull, and the mother I  used to call Flora; but now I calls her Aroarer, for she's too old to  bite.  Haw, haw!\"    Before the house of Queen's Crawley, which is an odious old-fashioned  red brick mansion, with tall chimneys and gables of the style of Queen  Bess, there is a terrace flanked by the family dove and serpent, and on  which the great hall-door opens.  And oh, my dear, the great hall I am  sure is as big and as glum as the great hall in the dear castle of  Udolpho.  It has a large fireplace, in which we might put half Miss  Pinkerton's school, and the grate is big enough to roast an ox at the  very least.  Round the room hang I don't know how many generations of  Crawleys, some with beards and ruffs, some with huge wigs and toes  turned out, some dressed in long straight stays and gowns that look as  stiff as towers, and some with long ringlets, and oh, my dear! scarcely  any stays at all.  At one end of the hall is the great staircase all in  black oak, as dismal as may be, and on either side are tall doors with  stags' heads over them, leading to the billiard-room and the library,  and the great yellow saloon and the morning-rooms.  I think there are  at least twenty bedrooms on the first floor; one of them has the bed in  which Queen Elizabeth slept; and I have been taken by my new pupils  through all these fine apartments this morning.  They are not rendered  less gloomy, I promise you, by having the shutters always shut; and  there is scarce one of the apartments, but when the light was let into  it, I expected to see a ghost in the room.  We have a schoolroom on the  second floor, with my bedroom leading into it on one side, and that of  the young ladies on the other.  Then there are Mr. Pitt's  apartments--Mr. Crawley, he is called--the eldest son, and Mr. Rawdon  Crawley's rooms--he is an officer like SOMEBODY, and away with his  regiment.  There is no want of room I assure you.  You might lodge all  the people in Russell Square in the house, I think, and have space to  spare.    Half an hour after our arrival, the great dinner-bell was rung, and I  came down with my two pupils (they are very thin insignificant little  chits of ten and eight years old).  I came down in your dear muslin  gown (about which that odious Mrs. Pinner was so rude, because you gave  it me); for I am to be treated as one of the family, except on company  days, when the young ladies and I are to dine upstairs.    Well, the great dinner-bell rang, and we all assembled in the little  drawing-room where my Lady Crawley sits.  She is the second Lady  Crawley, and mother of the young ladies.  She was an ironmonger's  daughter, and her marriage was thought a great match.  She looks as if  she had been handsome once, and her eyes are always weeping for the  loss of her beauty.  She is pale and meagre and high-shouldered, and  has not a word to say for herself, evidently.  Her stepson Mr. Crawley,  was likewise in the room.  He was in full dress, as pompous as an  undertaker.  He is pale, thin, ugly, silent; he has thin legs, no  chest, hay-coloured whiskers, and straw-coloured hair.  He is the very  picture of his sainted mother over the mantelpiece--Griselda of the  noble house of Binkie.    \"This is the new governess, Mr. Crawley,\" said Lady Crawley, coming  forward and taking my hand.  \"Miss Sharp.\"    \"O!\" said Mr. Crawley, and pushed his head once forward and began again  to read a great pamphlet with which he was busy.    \"I hope you will be kind to my girls,\" said Lady Crawley, with her pink  eyes always full of tears.    \"Law, Ma, of course she will,\" said the eldest: and I saw at a glance  that I need not be afraid of THAT woman. \"My lady is served,\" says the  butler in black, in an immense white shirt-frill, that looked as if it  had been one of the Queen Elizabeth's ruffs depicted in the hall; and  so, taking Mr. Crawley's arm, she led the way to the dining-room,  whither I followed with my little pupils in each hand.    Sir Pitt was already in the room with a silver jug.  He had just been  to the cellar, and was in full dress too; that is, he had taken his  gaiters off, and showed his little dumpy legs in black worsted  stockings.  The sideboard was covered with glistening old plate--old  cups, both gold and silver; old salvers and cruet-stands, like Rundell  and Bridge's shop.  Everything on the table was in silver too, and two  footmen, with red hair and canary-coloured liveries, stood on either  side of the sideboard.    Mr. Crawley said a long grace, and Sir Pitt said amen, and the great  silver dish-covers were removed.    \"What have we for dinner, Betsy?\" said the Baronet.    \"Mutton broth, I believe, Sir Pitt,\" answered Lady Crawley.    \"Mouton aux navets,\" added the butler gravely (pronounce, if you  please, moutongonavvy); \"and the soup is potage de mouton a  l'Ecossaise.  The side-dishes contain pommes de terre au naturel, and  choufleur a l'eau.\"    \"Mutton's mutton,\" said the Baronet, \"and a devilish good thing. What  SHIP was it, Horrocks, and when did you kill?\"  \"One of the black-faced  Scotch, Sir Pitt: we killed on Thursday.\"    \"Who took any?\"    \"Steel, of Mudbury, took the saddle and two legs, Sir Pitt; but he says  the last was too young and confounded woolly, Sir Pitt.\"    \"Will you take some potage, Miss ah--Miss Blunt? said Mr. Crawley.    \"Capital Scotch broth, my dear,\" said Sir Pitt, \"though they call it by  a French name.\"    \"I believe it is the custom, sir, in decent society,\" said Mr. Crawley,  haughtily, \"to call the dish as I have called it\"; and it was served to  us on silver soup plates by the footmen in the canary coats, with the  mouton aux navets.  Then \"ale and water\" were brought, and served to us  young ladies in wine-glasses.  I am not a judge of ale, but I can say  with a clear conscience I prefer water.    While we were enjoying our repast, Sir Pitt took occasion to ask what  had become of the shoulders of the mutton.    \"I believe they were eaten in the servants' hall,\" said my lady, humbly.    \"They was, my lady,\" said Horrocks, \"and precious little else we get  there neither.\"    Sir Pitt burst into a horse-laugh, and continued his conversation with  Mr. Horrocks.  \"That there little black pig of the Kent sow's breed  must be uncommon fat now.\"    \"It's not quite busting, Sir Pitt,\" said the butler with the gravest  air, at which Sir Pitt, and with him the young ladies, this time, began  to laugh violently.    \"Miss Crawley, Miss Rose Crawley,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"your laughter  strikes me as being exceedingly out of place.\"    \"Never mind, my lord,\" said the Baronet, \"we'll try the porker on  Saturday.  Kill un on Saturday morning, John Horrocks.  Miss Sharp  adores pork, don't you, Miss Sharp?\"    And I think this is all the conversation that I remember at dinner.  When the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir  Pitt, with a case-bottle containing, I believe, rum.  Mr. Horrocks  served myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a  bumper was poured out for my lady.  When we retired, she took from her  work-drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young  ladies began to play at cribbage with a dirty pack of cards.  We had  but one candle lighted, but it was in a magnificent old silver  candlestick, and after a very few questions from my lady, I had my  choice of amusement between a volume of sermons, and a pamphlet on the  corn-laws, which Mr. Crawley had been reading before dinner.    So we sat for an hour until steps were heard.    \"Put away the cards, girls,\" cried my lady, in a great tremor; \"put  down Mr. Crawley's books, Miss Sharp\"; and these orders had been  scarcely obeyed, when Mr. Crawley entered the room.    \"We will resume yesterday's discourse, young ladies,\" said he, \"and you  shall each read a page by turns; so that Miss a--Miss Short may have an  opportunity of hearing you\"; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#18)"],[1,"spot lower than the rest, and over this he  proceeded to adjust his coat very carefully; he then vaulted lightly  over himself, and calling upon me to aid by sundry flicks on Leo's  flank, the horse would be induced to jump over it. This was always a  work of time and trouble, for Leo hated doing it, and would rather have  leaped the widest winter creek, than jumped the lowest coat-covered wire  fence. Helen had to jump with me on her back, and without any friendly  whip to urge her, but except once, when she caught her hind leg in  the sleeve of the coat which was hanging over the fence, and tore it  completely out, she got over very well. Upon that occasion F---- had  to carry his sleeve in his pocket until we reached the neat little  out-station hut, where Jim Salter lived, and where we were pretty sure  to find a housewife, for shepherds are as handy as sailors with a needle  and thread.    I shall always believe that some bird of the air had \"carried the  matter\" to Salter, because not only was he at home, and in his Sunday  clothes, but he had made a cake the evening before, and that was a very  suspicious circumstance. However we pretended not to imagine that we  were expected, and Jim pretended with equal success to be much surprised  at our visit, so both sides were satisfied. Nothing could be neater  than the inside of the little hut; its cob walls papered with, old  Illustrated London News,--not only pictures but letter-press,--its tiny  window as clean as possible, a new sheep-skin rug laid down before the  open fireplace, where a bright wood fire was sputtering and cracking  cheerily, and the inevitable kettle suspended from a hook half-way up  the low chimney. Outside, the dog-kennels had been newly thatched with  tohi grass, the garden weeded and freshly dug, the chopping-block and  camp-oven as clean as scrubbing could make them. It was too late in the  year for fruit, but Salter's currant, raspberry, and gooseberry bushes  gave us a good idea of how well he must have fared in the summer. The  fowls were just devouring the last of the green-pea shoots, and the  potatoes had been blackened by our first frosts.    It was all very nice and trim and comfortable, except the loneliness;  that must have been simply awful. It is difficult to realise how  completely cut off from the society of his kind a New Zealand up-country  shepherd is, especially at an out-station like this. Once in every three  months he goes down to the homestead, borrows the pack horse, and leads  it up to his hut, with a quarter's rations of flour, tea, sugar and  salt; of course he provides himself with mutton and firewood, and his  simple wants are thus supplied. After shearing, about January, his wages  are paid, varying from 75 pounds to 100 pounds a year, according to  the locality, and then he gets a week's leave to go down to the nearest  town. If he be a prudent steady man, as our friend Salter was, he puts  his money in the bank, or lends it out on a freehold mortgage at ten  per cent., only deducting a few pounds from his capital for a suit of  clothes, a couple of pair of Cookham boots for hill walking, and above  all, some new books.    Without any exception, the shepherds I came across in New Zealand were  all passionately fond of reading; and they were also well-informed  men, who often expressed themselves in excellent, through superfine,  language. Their libraries chiefly consisted of yellow-covered novels,  and out of my visits in search of a congregation grew a scheme for a  book-club to supply something better in the way of literature, which was  afterwards most successfully carried out. But of this I need not speak  here, for we are still seated inside Salter's hut,--so small in its  dimensions that it could hardly have held another guest. Womanlike,  my eyes were everywhere, and I presently spied out an empty bottle,  labelled \"Worcestershire Sauce.\"    \"Dear me, Salter,\" I cried, \"I had no idea you were so grand as to  have sauces up here: why we hardly ever use them.\" \"Well, mum,\" replied  Salter, bashfully, and stroking his long black beard to gain time  to select the grandest words he could think of, \"it is hardly to be  regarded in the light of happetite, that there bottle, it is more in  the nature of remedies.\" Then, seeing that I still looked mystified, he  added, \"You see, mum, although we gets our 'elth uncommon well in these  salubrious mountings, still a drop of physic is often handy-like, and  in a general way I always purchase myself a box of Holloway's Pills  (of which you do get such a lot for your money), and also a bottle of  pain-killer; but last shearing they was out o' pain-killer, they said,  so they put me up a bottle o' Cain pepper, and likewise that 'ere  condiment, which was werry efficacious, 'specially towards the end o'  the bottle!\" \"And do you really mean to say you drank it, Salter?\" I  inquired with horror.    \"Certainly I do, mum, whenever I felt out o' sorts. It always took my  mind off the loneliness, and cheered me up wonderful, especial if I  hadded a little red pepper to it,\" said Salter, getting up from his log  of wood and making me a low bow. All this time F---- and I were seated  amicably side by side on poor Salter's red blanket-covered \"bunk,\" or  wooden bedstead, made of empty flour-sacks nailed between rough poles,  and other sacks filled with tussock grass for a mattress and pillow.    The word loneliness gave me a good opening to broach the subject of our  Sunday gatherings, and my suspicions of Jim's having been told of our  visit were confirmed by the alacrity with which he said, \"I have much  pleasure in accepting your kind invitation, mum, if so be as I am not  intruding.\"    \"No, indeed Salter,\" F---- said; \"you'd be very welcome, and you could  always turn Judy into the paddock whilst we were having service.\"    Now if there was one thing dearer to Salter's heart than another, it was  his little roan mare Judy: her excellent condition, and jaunty little  hog-mane and tail, testified to her master's loving care. So it was all  happily settled, and after paying a most unfashionably long visit to the  lonely man, we rode away with many a farewell nod and smile. I may say  here that Salter was one of the most regular of our congregation for  more than two years, besides being a member of the book club. In time,  its more sensible volumes utterly displaced the yellow paper rubbish in  his but library, and I never can forget the poor man's emotion when he  came to bid me good-bye.    At my request he made the rough little pen and ink sketches which are  here given, and as he held my offered hand (not knowing quite what else  to do with it) when I took leave of him after our last home-service,  when my face was set towards England, he could not say a word. The great  burly creature's heart must have been nearly as big as his body, and he  seemed hardly to know that large tears were rolling down his sunburnt  face and losing themselves in his bushy beard. I tried to be cheerful  myself, but he kept repeating, \"It is only natural you should be glad  to go, yet it is very rough upon us.\" In vain I assured him I was not  at all glad to go,--very, very sorry, in fact: all he would say was, \"To  England, home and beauty, in course any one would be pleased to  return.\" I can't tell you what he meant, and he had no voice to waste on  explanations; I only give poor dear Jim's valedictory sentences as they  fell from his white and trembling lips.    Very different was Ned Palmer, the most diminutive and wiry of hill  shepherds, with a tongue which seemed never tired, and a good humoured  smile for every one. Ned used to try my gravity sorely by stepping up to  me half a dozen times during the service, to find his place for him in  his Prayer-book, and always saying aloud, \"Thank you kindly, m'm.\"        Chapter IX: Another shepherd's hut.      To get to Ned's hut--which was not nearly so trim or comfortable as  Salter's, and stood out in the midst of a vast plain covered with waving  yellow tussocks,--we had to cross a low range of hills, and pick our  way through nearly a mile of swampy ground on the other side. The  sure-footed horses zig-zagged their way up the steep hill-side with  astonishing ease, availing themselves here and there of a sheep track,  for sheep are the best engineers in the world, and always hit off the  safest and easiest line of country. I did not feel nervous going _up_  the hill, although we must have appeared, had there been any one to look  at us, more like flies on a wall than a couple of people on horse back,  but when we came to the ridge and looked down on the descent beneath us,  my heart fairly gave way.    Not a blade of grass, or a leaf of a shrub, was to be seen on all the  steep slope, or rather precipice, for there was very little slope about  it; nothing but grey loose shingle, which the first hoof-fall of  the leading horse invariably sent slipping and sliding, in a perfect  avalanche of rubble, down into the soft bright green morass beneath.  Of all the bad \"tracks\" I encountered in my primitive rides, I really  believe I suffered more real terror and anguish on that particular  hill-side than on any other. My companion's conduct too, used to be  heartless in the extreme. He let the reins fall loosely on his horse's  neck, merely holding their extreme ends, settled himself comfortably  in his saddle, leaning well back, and turning round laughingly to  me, observed, \"Aren't you coming?\" \"Oh, not there,\" I cried in true  melo-dramatic tones of horror; but it was all in vain, F---- merely  remarked \"You have nothing to do but fancy you are sitting in an  arm-chair at home, you are quite as safe.\" \"What nonsense,\" I gasped. \"I  only wish I _was_ at home: never, never will I come out riding again.\"  All this time the leading horse was slowly and carefully edging himself  down hill a few steps to the right, then a few to the left, "]]]
