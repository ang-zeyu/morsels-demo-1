[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#18)"],[1,"many slaves were in the castle, and the youth  replied that he would try to count them and let him know.    Tom Atto had, they found, prepared for them an excellent meal, and  they ate heartily because they were really hungry. After luncheon  Cap'n Bill smoked his pipe contentedly, and they renewed their  conversation, planning various ways to outwit Zog and make their  escape. While thus engaged, the gong at the door sounded and Sacho  entered.    \"My diabolical master commands you to attend him,\" said the boy.    \"When?\" asked Aquareine.    \"At once, your Majesty.\"    \"Very well, we will follow you,\" she said. So they swam down the  corridors following Sacho until they again reached the golden-domed  room they had formerly visited. Here sat Zog just as they had left  him, seemingly, but when his prisoners entered, the magician arose  and stood upon his cloven feet and then silently walked to a  curtained archway.    Sacho commanded the prisoners to follow, and beyond the archway they  found a vast chamber that occupied the center of the castle and was  as big as a ballroom. Zog, who seemed to walk with much difficulty  because his ungainly body swayed back and forth, did not go far  beyond the arched entrance. A golden throne was set nearby, and in  this the monster seated himself. At one side of the throne stood a  group of slaves. They were men, women and children. All had broad  gold bands clasped around their ankles as a badge of servitude, and  at each throat were the fish's gills that enabled them to breathe  and live under water. Yet every face was smiling and serene, even in  the presence of their dread master. In parts of the big hall were  groups of other slaves.    Sacho ranged the prisoners in a circle before Zog's throne, and  slowly the magician turned his eyes, glowing like live coals, upon  the four. \"Captives,\" said he, speaking in his clear, sweet voice,  \"in our first interview you defied me, and both the mermaid queen  and the princess declared they could not die. But if that is a true  statement, as I have yet to discover, there are various ways to make  you miserable and unhappy, and this I propose to do in order to  amuse myself at your expense. You have been brought here to undergo  the first trial of strength between us.\" None of the prisoners  replied to this speech, so Zog turned to one of his slaves and said,  \"Rivivi, bring in the Yell-Maker.\"    Rivivi was a big fellow, brown of skin and with flashing, black  eyes. He bowed to his master and left the room by an archway covered  with heavy draperies. The next moment these curtains were violently  pushed aside, and a dreadful sea creature swam into the hall. It had  a body much like that of a crab, only more round and of a jet-black  color. Its eyes were bright yellow balls set on the ends of two  horns that stuck out of its head. They were cruel-looking eyes, too,  and seemed able to see every person in the room at the same time.  The legs of the Yell-Maker, however, were the most curious part of  the creature. There were six of them, slender and black as coal, and  each extended twelve to fifteen feet from its body when stretched  out in a straight line. They were hinged in several places so they  could be folded up or extended at will. At the ends of these thin  legs were immense claws shaped like those of a lobster, and they  were real \"nippers\" of a most dangerous sort.    The prisoners knew, as soon as they saw the awful claws, why the  thing was called the \"Yell-Maker,\" and Trot gave a little shiver and  crept closer to Cap'n Bill. Zog looked with approval upon the  creature he had summoned and said to it, \"I give you four victims,  the four people with fish's tails. Let me hear how loud they can  yell.\"    The Yell-Maker uttered a grunt of pleasure and in a flash stretched  out one of its long legs toward the queen's nose, where its powerful  claws came together with a loud noise. Aquareine did not stir; she  only smiled. Both Zog and the creature that had attacked her seemed  much surprised to find she was unhurt. \"Again!\" cried Zog, and again  the Yell-Maker's claw shot out and tried to pinch the queen's pretty  ear. But the magic of the fairy mermaid was proof against this  sea-rascal's strength and swiftness, nor could he touch any part of  Aquareine, although he tried again and again, roaring with anger  like a mad bull.    Trot began to enjoy this performance, and as her merry, childish  laughter rang out, the Yell-Maker turned furiously upon the little  girl, two of the dreadful claws trying to nip her at the same time.  She had no chance to cry out or jump backward, yet she remained  unharmed. For the Fairy Circle of Queen Aquareine kept her safe. Now  Cap'n Bill was attacked, and Princess Clia as well. The half-dozen  slender legs darted in every direction like sword thrusts to reach  their victims, and the cruel claws snapped so rapidly that the sound  was like the rattling of castanets. But the four prisoners regarded  their enemy with smiling composure, and no yell greeted the  Yell-Maker's efforts.    \"Enough!\" said Zog, softly and sweetly. \"You may retire, my poor  Yell-Maker, for with these people you are powerless.\"    The creature paused and rolled its yellow eyes. \"May I nip just one  of the slaves, oh Zog?\" it asked pleadingly. \"I hate to leave  without pleasing your ears with a single yell.\"    \"Let my slaves alone,\" was Zog's answer. \"They are here to serve me  and must not be injured. Go, feeble one.\"    \"Not so!\" cried the Queen. \"It is a shame, Zog, that such an evil  thing should exist in our fair sea.\" With this, she drew her fairy  wand from a fold of her gown and waved it toward the creature. At  once the Yell-Maker sank down unconscious upon the floor; its legs  fell apart in many pieces, the claws tumbling in a heap beside the  body. Then all grew withered and lost shape, becoming a pulpy mass,  like gelatin. A few moments later the creature had melted away to  nothing at all, forever disappearing from the ocean where it had  caused so much horror and pain.    Zog watched this destruction with surprising patience. When it was  all over, he nodded his head and smiled, and Trot noticed that  whenever Zog smiled, his slaves lost their jolly looks and began to  tremble. \"That is very pretty magic, Aquareine,\" said the monster.  \"I myself learned the trick several thousand years ago, so it does  not astonish me. Have you fairies nothing that is new to show me?\"    \"We desire only to protect ourselves,\" replied the Queen with  dignity.    \"Then I will give you a chance to do so,\" said Zog. As he spoke, the  great marble blocks in the ceiling of the room directly over the  heads of the captives gave way and came crashing down upon them.  Many tons of weight were in these marble blocks, and the magician  had planned to crush his victims where they stood. But the four were  still unharmed. The marble, being unable to touch them, was diverted  from its course, and when the roar of the great crash had died away,  Zog saw his intended victims standing quietly in their places and  smiling scornfully at his weak attempts to destroy them.          CHAPTER 16    THE TOP OF THE GREAT DOME      Cap'n Bill's heart was beating pretty vast, but he did not let Zog  know that. Trot was so sure of the protection of the fairy mermaids  that she would not allow herself to become frightened. Aquareine and  Clia were as calm as if nothing had happened.    \"Please excuse this little interruption,\" said Zog. \"I knew very  well the marble blocks would not hurt you. But the play is over for  a time. You may now retire to your rooms, and when I again invite  you to my presence, I shall have found some better ways to entertain  you.\"    Without reply to this threat, they turned and followed Sacho from  the hall, and the boy led them straight back to their own rooms.    \"Zog is making a great mistake,\" said Sacho with a laugh. \"He has no  time for vengeance, but the great magician does not know that.\"    \"What is he trying to do, anyway?\" asked Trot.    \"He does not tell me all his secrets, but I've an idea he wants to  kill you,\" replied Sacho. \"How absurd it is to be plotting such a  thing when he might spend his time in laughing and being jolly!  Isn't it, now?\"    \"Zog is a wicked, wicked creature!\" exclaimed Trot.    \"But he had his good points,\" replied Sacho cheerfully. \"There is no  one about in the world so bad that there is nothing good about him.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"What are Zog's good  points?\"    \"All his slaves were saved from drowning, and he is kind to them,\"  said Sacho.    \"That is merely the kindness of selfishness,\" said Aquareine. \"Tell  me, my lad, is the opening in the great dome outside guarded?\"    \"Yes indeed,\" was the reply. \"You cannot hope to escape in that way,  for the prince of the sea devils, who is the largest and fiercest of  his race, lies crouched over the opening night and day, and none can  pass his network of curling legs.\"    \"Is there no avenue that is not guarded?\" continued Aquareine.    \"None at all, your Majesty. Zog is always careful to be well  guarded, for he fears the approach of an enemy. What this enemy can  be to terrify the great magician I do not know, but Zog is always  afraid and never leaves an entrance unguarded. Besides, it is an  enchanted castle, you know, and none in the ocean can see it unless  Zog wishes him to. So it will be very hard for his enemy to find  him.\"    \"We wish to escape,\" said Clia. \"Will you help us, Sacho?\"    \"In any way I can,\" replied the boy.    \"If we succeed, we will take you with us,\" continued the Princess.    But Sacho shook his head and laughed. \"I would indeed like to see  you escape Zog's vengeance,\" said he, \"for vengeance is wrong, and  you are too pretty and too good to be destroyed. But I am happy here  and have no wish to go away, having no other home or friends other  than my fellow slaves.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#18)"],[1,"?\" gurgled the cowardly sailor.    \"I'm going to feed you to the sharks--unless you promise to keep your  mouth shut,\" retorted the boy.  \"Now, then; decide at once!  Which will  it be--sharks or silence?\"    \"I won't say a word--'pon my honor, I won't!\" said the sailor  shudderingly.    \"All right; remember your promise and we'll have no further trouble,\"  remarked Rob, who had hard work to keep from laughing at the man's  abject terror.    Once more he ascended and continued the journey, and for several hours  they rode along swiftly and silently.  Rob's shoulders were beginning  to ache with the continued tugging of the vine upon them, but the  thought that he was saving the lives of two unfortunate  fellow-creatures gave him strength and courage to persevere.    Night was falling when they first sighted land; a wild and seemingly  uninhabited stretch of the American coast.  Rob made no effort to  select a landing place, for he was nearly worn out with a strain and  anxiety of the journey.  He dropped his burden upon the brow of a high  bluff overlooking the sea and, casting the vine from his shoulders,  fell to the earth exhausted and half fainting.          17.  The Coast of Oregon      When he had somewhat recovered, Rob sat up and looked around him.  The  elder sailor was kneeling in earnest prayer, offering grateful thanks  for his escape from suffering and death.  The younger one lay upon the  ground sobbing and still violently agitated by recollections of the  frightful experiences he had undergone.  Although he did not show his  feelings as plainly as the men, the boy was none the less gratified at  having been instrumental in saving the lives of two fellow-beings.    The darkness was by this time rapidly enveloping them, so Rob asked his  companions to gather some brushwood and light a fire, which they  quickly did.  The evening was cool for the time of year, and the heat  from the fire was cheering and grateful; so they all lay near the  glowing embers and fell fast asleep.    The sound of voices aroused Rob next morning, and on opening his eyes  and gazing around he saw several rudely dressed men approaching.  The  two shipwrecked sailors were still sound asleep.    Rob stood up and waited for the strangers to draw near.  They seemed to  be fishermen, and were much surprised at finding three people asleep  upon the bluff.    \"Whar 'n thunder 'd ye come from?\" asked the foremost fisherman, in a  surprised voice.    \"From the sea,\" replied the boy.  \"My friends here are shipwrecked  sailors from the 'Cynthia Jane.'\"    \"But how'd ye make out to climb the bluff?\" inquired a second  fisherman; \"no one ever did it afore, as we knows on.\"    \"Oh, that is a long story,\" replied the boy, evasively.    The two sailors had awakened and now saluted the new-comers.  Soon they  were exchanging a running fire of questions and answers.    \"Where are we?\" Rob heard the little sailor ask.    \"Coast of Oregon,\" was the reply.  \"We're about seven miles from Port  Orford by land an' about ten miles by sea.\"    \"Do you live at Port Orford?\" inquired the sailor.    \"That's what we do, friend; an' if your party wants to join us we'll do  our best to make you comf'table, bein' as you're shipwrecked an' need  help.\"    Just then a loud laugh came from another group, where the elder sailor  had been trying to explain Rob's method of flying through the air.    \"Laugh all you want to,\" said the sailor, sullenly; \"it's true--ev'ry  word of it!\"    \"Mebbe you think it, friend,\" answered a big, good-natured fisherman;  \"but it's well known that shipwrecked folks go crazy sometimes, an'  imagine strange things.  Your mind seems clear enough in other ways, so  I advise you to try and forget your dreams about flyin'.\"    Rob now stepped forward and shook hands with the sailors.    \"I see you have found friends,\" he said to them, \"so I will leave you  and continue my journey, as I'm in something of a hurry.\"    Both sailors began to thank him profusely for their rescue, but he cut  them short.    \"That's all right.  Of course I couldn't leave you on that island to  starve to death, and I'm glad I was able to bring you away with me.\"    \"But you threatened to drop me into the sea,\" remarked the little  sailor, in a grieved voice.    \"So I did,\" said Rob, laughing; \"but I wouldn't have done it for the  world--not even to have saved my own life.  Good-by!\"    He turned the indicator and mounted skyward, to the unbounded amazement  of the fishermen, who stared after him with round eyes and wide open  mouths.    \"This sight will prove to them that the sailors are not crazy,\" he  thought, as he turned to the south and sped away from the bluff.  \"I  suppose those simple fishermen will never forget this wonderful  occurrence, and they'll probably make reg'lar heroes of the two men who  have crossed the Pacific through the air.\"    He followed the coast line, keeping but a short distance above the  earth, and after an hour's swift flight reached the city of San  Francisco.    His shoulders were sore and stiff from the heavy strain upon them of  the previous day, and he wished more than once that he had some of his  mother's household liniment to rub them with.  Yet so great was his  delight at reaching once more his native land that all discomforts were  speedily forgotten.    Much as he would have enjoyed a day in the great metropolis of the  Pacific slope, Rob dared not delay longer than to take a general view  of the place, to note its handsome edifices and to wonder at the throng  of Chinese inhabiting one section of the town.    These things were much more plainly and quickly viewed by Rob from  above than by threading a way through the streets on foot; for he  looked down upon the city as a bird does, and covered miles with a  single glance.    Having satisfied his curiosity without attempting to alight, he turned  to the southeast and followed the peninsula as far as Palo Alto, where  he viewed the magnificent buildings of the university.  Changing his  course to the east, he soon reached Mount Hamilton, and, being  attracted by the great tower of the Lick Observatory, he hovered over  it until he found he had attracted the excited gaze of the inhabitants,  who doubtless observed him very plainly through the big telescope.    But so unreal and seemingly impossible was the sight witnessed by the  learned astronomers that they have never ventured to make the incident  public, although long after the boy had darted away into the east they  argued together concerning the marvelous and incomprehensible vision.  Afterward they secretly engrossed the circumstance upon their records,  but resolved never to mention it in public, lest their wisdom and  veracity should be assailed by the skeptical.    Meantime Rob rose to a higher altitude, and sped swiftly across the  great continent.  By noon he sighted Chicago, and after a brief  inspection of the place from the air determined to devote at least an  hour to forming the acquaintance of this most wonderful and  cosmopolitan city.          18.  A Narrow Escape      The Auditorium Tower, where \"the weather man\" sits to flash his reports  throughout the country, offered an inviting place for the boy to  alight.  He dropped quietly upon the roof of the great building and  walked down the staircase until he reached the elevators, by means of  which he descended to the ground floor without exciting special  attention.    The eager rush and hurry of the people crowding the sidewalks impressed  Rob with the idea that they were all behind time and were trying hard  to catch up.  He found it impossible to walk along comfortably without  being elbowed and pushed from side to side; so a half hour's  sight-seeing under such difficulties tired him greatly.  It was a  beautiful afternoon, and finding himself upon the Lake Front, Rob  hunted up a vacant bench and sat down to rest.    Presently an elderly gentleman with a reserved and dignified appearance  and dressed in black took a seat next to the boy and drew a magazine  from his pocket.  Rob saw that he opened it to an article on \"The  Progress of Modern Science,\" in which he seemed greatly interested.    After a time the boy remembered that he was hungry, not having eaten a  tablet in more than twenty-four hours.  So he took out the silver box  and ate one of the small, round disks it contained.    \"What are those?\" inquired the old gentleman in a soft voice.  \"You are  too young to be taking patent medicines.\"    \"There are not medicines, exactly,\" answered the boy, with a smile.  \"They are Concentrated Food Tablets, sorted with nourishment by means  of electricity.  One of them furnishes a person with food for an entire  day.\"    The old gentleman stared at Rob a moment and then laid down his  magazine and took the box in his hands, examining the tablets curiously.    \"Are these patented?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Rob; \"they are unknown to any one but myself.\"    \"I will give you a half million dollars for the recipe to make them,\"  said the gentleman.    \"I fear I must refuse your offer,\" returned Rob, with a laugh.    \"I'll make it a million,\" said the gentleman, coolly.    Rob shook his head.    \"Money can't buy the recipe,\" he said; \"for I don't know it myself.\"    \"Couldn't the tablets be chemically analyzed, and the secret  discovered?\" inquired the other.    \"I don't know; but I'm not going to give any one the chance to try,\"  declared the boy, firmly.    The old gentleman picked up his magazine without another word, and  resumed his reading.    For amusement Rob took the Record of Events from his pocket and began  looking at the scenes reflected from its polished plate.    Presently he became aware that the old gentleman was peering over his  shoulder with intense interest.  General Funston was just then engaged  in capturing the rebel chief, Aguinaldo, and for a few moments both man  and boy observed the occurrence with rapt attention.  As"]]]
