[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#18)"],[1,"to brood on the past; for New York is the  City of the Present, the City of Things that are Going On.    To Betty everything was new and strange. Her previous acquaintance with  the metropolis had not been extensive. Mr. Scobell's home--or, rather,  the house which he owned in America--was on the outskirts of  Philadelphia, and it was there that she had lived when she was not  paying visits. Occasionally, during horse-show week, or at some other  time of festivity, she had spent a few days with friends who lived in  Madison or upper Fifth Avenue, but beyond that, New York was a closed  book to her.    It would have been a miracle in the circumstances, if John and Mervo  and the whole of the events since the arrival of the great cable had  not to some extent become a little dream-like. When she was alone at  night, and had leisure to think, the dream became a reality once more;  but in her hours of work, or what passed for work in the office of  _Peaceful Moments_, and in the hours she spent walking about the  streets and observing the ways of this new world of hers, it faded.  Everything was so bright and busy! Every moment had its fresh interest.    And, above all, there was the sense of adventure. She was twenty-four;  she had health and an imagination; and almost unconsciously she was  stimulated by the thrill of being for the first time in her life  genuinely at large. The child's love of hiding dies hard in us. To  Betty, to walk abroad in New York in the midst of hurrying crowds, just  Betty Brown--one of four million and no longer the beautiful Miss  Silver of the society column, was to taste the romance of disguise, or  invisibility.    During office hours she came near to complete contentment. To an expert  stenographer the amount of work to be done would have seemed  ridiculously small, but Betty, who liked plenty of time for a task,  generally managed to make it last comfortably through the day.    This was partly owing to the fact that her editor, when not actually at  work himself, was accustomed to engage her in conversation, and to keep  her so engaged until the entrance of Pugsy Maloney heralded the arrival  of some caller.    Betty liked Smith. His odd ways, his conversation, and his extreme  solicitude for his clothes amused her. She found his outlook on life  refreshing. Smith was an optimist. Whatever cataclysm might occur, he  never doubted for a moment that he would be comfortably on the summit  of the debris when all was over. He amazed Betty with his stories of  his reportorial adventures. He told them for the most part as humorous  stories at his own expense, but the fact remained that in a  considerable proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and  violent death by adroitness or pure good luck. His conversation opened  up a new world to Betty. She began to see that in America, and  especially in New York, anything may happen to anybody. She looked on  Smith with new eyes.    \"But surely all this,\" she said one morning, after he had come to the  end of the story of a highly delicate piece of interviewing work in  connection with some Cumberland Mountains feudists, \"surely all this--\"  She looked round the room.    \"Domesticity?\" suggested Smith.    \"Yes,\" said Betty. \"Surely it all seems rather tame to you?\"    Smith sighed.    \"Comrade Brown,\" he said, \"you have touched the spot with an unerring  finger.\"    Since Mr. Renshaw's departure, the flatness of life had come home to  Smith with renewed emphasis. Before, there had always been the quiet  entertainment of watching the editor at work, but now he was feeling  restless. Like John at Mervo, he was practically nothing but an  ornament. _Peaceful Moments_, like Mervo, had been set rolling and  had continued to roll on almost automatically. The staff of regular  contributors sent in their various pages. There was nothing for the man  in charge to do. Mr. Renshaw had been one of those men who have a  genius for being as busy over nothing as if it were some colossal work,  but Smith had not that gift. He liked something that he could grip and  that gripped him. He was becoming desperately bored. He felt like a  marooned sailor on a barren rock of domesticity.    A visitor who called at the office at this time did nothing to remove  this sensation of being outside everything that made life worth living.  Betty, returning to the office one afternoon, found Smith in the  doorway, just parting from a thickset young man. There was a rather  gloomy expression on the thickset young man's face.    Smith, too, she noted, when they were back in the inner office, seemed  to have something on his mind. He was strangely silent.    \"Comrade Brown,\" he said at last, \"I wish this little journal of ours  had a sporting page.\"    Betty laughed.    \"Less ribaldry,\" protested Smith pained. \"This is a sad affair. You saw  the man I was talking to? That was Kid Brady. I used to know him when I  was out West. He wants to fight anyone in the country at a hundred and  thirty-three pounds. We all have our hobbies. That is Comrade Brady's.\"    \"Is he a boxer?\"    \"He would like to be. Out West, nobody could touch him. He's in the  championship class. But he has been pottering about New York for a  month without being able to get a fight. If we had a sporting page on  _Peaceful Moments_ we could do him some good, but I don't see how  we can write him up,\" said Smith, picking up a copy of the paper, and  regarding it gloomily, \"in 'Moments in the Nursery' or 'Moments with  Budding Girlhood.'\"    He put up his eyeglass, and stared at the offending journal with the  air of a vegetarian who has found a caterpillar in his salad.  Incredulity, dismay, and disgust fought for precedence in his  expression.    \"B. Henderson Asher,\" he said severely, \"ought to be in some sort of a  home. Cain killed Abel for telling him that story.\"    He turned to another page, and scrutinized it with deepening gloom.    \"Is Luella Granville Waterman by any chance a friend of yours, Comrade  Brown? No? I am glad. For it seems to me that for sheer, concentrated  piffle, she is in a class by herself.\"    He read on for a few moments in silence, then looked up and fixed Betty  with his monocle. There was righteous wrath in his eyes.    \"And people,\" he said, \"are paying money for this! _Money!_ Even  now they are sitting down and writing checks for a year's subscription.  It isn't right! It's a skin game. I am assisting in a carefully planned  skin game!\"    \"But perhaps they like it,\" suggested Betty.    Smith shook his head.    \"It is kind of you to try and soothe my conscience, but it is useless.  I see my position too clearly. Think of it, Comrade Brown! Thousands of  poor, doddering, half-witted creatures in Brooklyn and Flatbush, who  ought not really to have control of their own money at all, are getting  buncoed out of whatever it is per annum in exchange for--how shall I  put it in a forcible yet refined and gentlemanly manner?--for cat's  meat of this description. Why, selling gold bricks is honest compared  with it. And I am temporarily responsible for the black business!\"    He extended a lean hand with melodramatic suddenness toward Betty. The  unexpectedness of the movement caused her to start back in her chair  with a little exclamation of surprise. Smith nodded with a kind of  mournful satisfaction.    \"Exactly!\" he said. \"As I expected! You shrink from me. You avoid my  polluted hand. How could it be otherwise? A conscientious green-goods  man would do the same.\" He rose from his seat. \"Your attitude,\" he  said, \"confirms me in a decision that has been in my mind for some  days. I will no longer calmly accept this terrible position. I will try  to make amends. While I am in charge, I will give our public something  worth reading. All these Watermans and Ashers and Parslows must go!\"    \"Go!\"    \"Go!\" repeated Smith firmly. \"I have been thinking it over for days.  You cannot look me in the face, Comrade Brown, and say that there is a  single feature which would not be better away. I mean in the paper, not  in my face. Every one of these punk pages must disappear. Letters must  be despatched at once, informing Julia Burdett Parslow and the others,  and in particular B. Henderson Asher, who, on brief acquaintance,  strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber--that, unless  they cease their contributions instantly, we shall call up the police  reserves. Then we can begin to move.\"    Betty, like most of his acquaintances, seldom knew whether Smith was  talking seriously or not. She decided to assume, till he should dismiss  the idea, that he meant what he said.    \"But you can't!\" she exclaimed.    \"With your kind cooperation, nothing easier. You supply the mechanical  work. I will compose the letters. First, B. Henderson Asher. 'Dear  Sir'--\"    \"But--\" she fell back on her original remark--\"but you can't. What will  Mr. Renshaw say when he comes back?\"    \"Sufficient unto the day. I have a suspicion that he will be the  first to approve. His vacation will have made him see things  differently--purified him, as it were. His conscience will be alive  once more.\"    \"But--\"    \"Why should we worry ourselves because the end of this venture is  wrapped in obscurity? Why, Columbus didn't know where he was going to  when he set out. All he knew was some highly interesting fact about an  egg. What that was, I do not at the moment recall, but I understand it  acted on Columbus like a tonic. We are the Columbuses of the  journalistic world. Full steam ahead, and see what happens. If Comrade  Renshaw is not pleased, why, I shall have been a martyr to a good  cause. It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done,  so to speak. Why should I allow possible inconvenience to myself to  stand in the way of the happiness which we propose to inject into those  Brooklyn and Flatbush homes? Are you ready then, once more?

'Then how did you get here?'    'That was the one stroke of luck I've had this afternoon. I started to  walk back, and after I'd gone about a quarter of a mile, Adamson caught  me up in his dog-cart. I suggested that it would be a Christian act on  his part to give me a lift, and he did. I shall remember Adamson in my  will.'    'Tell us what happened.'    'I'll tell thee everything I can,' said Charteris. 'There's little to  relate. I saw an aged, aged man a-sitting on a gate. Where do you want  me to begin?'    'At the beginning. Don't rot.'    'I was born,' began Charteris, 'of poor but honest parents, who sent  me to school at an early age in order that I might acquire a grasp of  the Greek and Latin languages, now obsolete. I--'    'How did you lose?' enquired the Babe.    'The other man beat me. If he hadn't, I should have won hands down. Oh,  I say, guess who I met at Rutton.'    'Not a beak?'    'No. Almost as bad, though. The Bargee man who paced me from Stapleton.  Man who crocked Tony.'    'Great _Scott_!' cried the Babe. 'Did he recognize you?'    'Rather. We had a very pleasant conversation.'    'If he reports you,' began the Babe.    'Who's that?'    Charteris looked up. Tony Graham had entered the study.    'Hullo, Tony! Adamson told me to remember him to you.'    'So you've got back?'    Charteris confirmed the hasty guess.    'But what are you talking about, Babe?' said Tony. 'Who's going to be  reported, and who's going to report?'    The Babe briefly explained the situation.    'If the man,' he said, 'reports Charteris, he may get run in tomorrow,  and then we shall have both our halves away against Dacre's. Charteris,  you are a fool to go rotting about out of bounds like this.'    'Nay, dry the starting tear,' said Charteris cheerfully. 'In the first  place, I shouldn't get kept in on a Thursday anyhow. I should be shoved  into extra on Saturday. Also, I shrewdly conveyed to the Bargee the  impression that I was at Rutton by special permission.'    'He's bound to know that that can't be true,' said Tony.    'Well, I told him to think it over. You see, he got so badly left last  time he tried to compass my downfall, that I shouldn't be a bit  surprised if he let the job alone this journey.'    'Let's hope so,' said the Babe gloomily.    'That's right, Babby,' remarked Charteris encouragingly, nodding at the  pessimist.    'You buck up and keep looking on the bright side. It'll be all right.  You see if it won't. If there's any running in to be done, I shall do  it. I shall be frightfully fit tomorrow after all this dashing about  today. I haven't an ounce of superfluous flesh on me. I'm a fine,  strapping specimen of sturdy young English manhood. And I'm going to  play a _very_ selfish game tomorrow, Babe.'    'Oh, my dear chap, you mustn't.' The Babe's face wore an expression of  horror. The success of the House-team in the final was very near to his  heart. He could not understand anyone jesting on the subject. Charteris  respected his anguish, and relieved it speedily.    'I was only ragging,' he said. 'Considering that our three-quarter line  is our one strong point, I'm not likely to keep the ball from it, if I  get a chance of getting it out. Make your mind easy, Babe.'    The final House-match was always a warmish game. The rivalry between  the various Houses was great, and the football cup especially was  fought for with immense keenness. Also, the match was the last fixture  of the season, and there was a certain feeling in the teams that if  they _did_ happen to disable a man or two, it would not matter  much. The injured sportsman would not be needed for School-match  purposes for another six months. As a result of which philosophical  reflection, the tackling was ruled slightly energetic, and the  handing-off was done with vigour.    This year, to add a sort of finishing touch, there was just a little  ill-feeling between Dacre's and Merevale's. The cause of it was the  Babe. Until the beginning of the term he had been a day boy. Then the  news began to circulate that he was going to become a boarder, either  at Dacre's or at Merevale's. He chose the latter, and Dacre's felt  slightly aggrieved. Some of the less sportsmanlike members of the House  had proposed that a protest should be made against his being allowed to  play, but, fortunately for the credit of Dacre's, Prescott, the captain  of the House Fifteen, had put his foot down with an emphatic bang at  the suggestion. As he sagely pointed out, there were some things which  were bad form, and this was one of them. If the team wanted to express  their disapproval, said he, let them do it on the field by tackling  their very hardest. He personally was going to do his best, and he  advised them to do the same.    The rumour of this bad blood had got about the School in some  mysterious manner, and when Swift, Merevale's only First Fifteen  forward, kicked off up the hill, a large crowd was lining the ropes. It  was evident from the outset that it would be a good game.    Dacre's were the better side--as a team. They had no really weak spot.  But Merevale's extraordinarily strong three-quarter line somewhat made  up for an inferior scrum. And the fact that the Babe was in the centre  was worth much.    At first Dacre's pressed. Their pack was unusually heavy for a  House-team, and they made full use of it. They took the ball down the  field in short rushes till they were in Merevale's twenty-five. Then  they began to heel, and, if things had been more or less exciting for  the Merevalians before, they became doubly so now. The ground was dry,  and so was the ball, and the game consequently waxed fast. Time after  time the ball went along Dacre's three-quarter line, only to end by  finding itself hurled, with the wing who was carrying it, into touch.  Occasionally the centres, instead of feeding their wings, would try to  dodge through themselves. And that was where the Babe came in. He was  admittedly the best tackler in the School, but on this occasion he  excelled himself. His man never had a chance of getting past. At last a  lofty kick into touch over the heads of the spectators gave the players  a few seconds' rest.    The Babe went up to Charteris.    'Look here,' he said, 'it's risky, but I think we'll try having the  ball out a bit.'    'In our own twenty-five?' said Charteris.    'Wherever we are. I believe it will come off all right. Anyway, we'll  try it. Tell the forwards.'    For forwards playing against a pack much heavier than themselves, it is  easier to talk about letting the ball out than to do it. The first half  dozen times that Merevale's scrum tried to heel they were shoved off  their feet, and it was on the enemy's side that the ball went out. But  the seventh attempt succeeded. Out it came, cleanly and speedily.  Daintree, who was playing instead of Tony, switched it across to  Charteris. Charteris dodged the half who was marking him, and ran.  Heeling and passing in one's own twenty-five is like smoking--an  excellent practice if indulged in in moderation. On this occasion it  answered perfectly. Charteris ran to the half-way line, and handed the  ball on to the Babe. The Babe was tackled from behind, and passed to  Thomson. Thomson dodged his man, and passed to Welch on the wing. Welch  was the fastest sprinter in the School. It was a pleasure--if you did  not happen to be one of the opposing side--to see him race down the  touch-line. He was off like an arrow. Dacre's back made a futile  attempt to get at him. Welch could have given the back fifteen yards in  a hundred. He ran round him, and, amidst terrific applause from the  Merevale's-supporting section of the audience, scored between the  posts. The Babe took the kick and converted without difficulty. Five  minutes afterwards the whistle blew for half-time.    The remainder of the game does not call for detailed description.  Dacre's pressed nearly the whole of the last half hour, but twice more  the ball came out and went down Merevale's three-quarter line. Once it  was the Babe who scored with a run from his own goal-line, and once  Charteris, who got in from half-way, dodging through the whole team.  The last ten minutes of the game was marked by a slight excess of  energy on both sides. Dacre's forwards were in a decidedly bad temper,  and fought like tigers to break through, and Merevale's played up to  them with spirit. The Babe seemed continually to be precipitating  himself at the feet of rushing forwards, and Charteris felt as if at  least a dozen bones were broken in various portions of his anatomy. The  game ended on Merevale's line, but they had won the match and the cup  by two goals and a try to nothing.    Charteris limped off the field, cheerful but damaged. He ached all  over, and there was a large bruise on his left cheek-bone. He and Babe  were going to the House, when they were aware that the Headmaster was  beckoning to them.    'Well, MacArthur, and what was the result of the match?'    'We won, sir,' boomed the Babe. 'Two goals and a try to _nil_.'    'You have hurt your cheek, Charteris?'    'Yes, sir.'    'How did you do that?'    'I got a kick, sir, in one of the rushes.'    'Ah. I should bathe it, Charteris. Bathe it well. I hope it will not be  very painful. Bathe it well in warm water.'    He walked on.    'You know,' said Charteris to the Babe, as they went into the House,  'the Old Man isn't such a bad sort after all. He has his points, don't  you think?'    The Babe said that he did.    'I'm going to reform, you know,' continued Charteris confidentially.    'It's about time,' said the Babe. 'You can have the bath first if you  like. Only buck up.'    Charteris boiled himself for ten minutes, and then dragged his weary  limbs to his study. It was while he was sitting in a deck-chair eating  mixed biscuits, and"]]]
