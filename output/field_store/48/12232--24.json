That was in  1845--46, during the United States Exploring Expedition that visited  the then little known Japan. The chaplain of the fleet, the Rev. Mr  Jones, went out prepared to study the mysterious light in all its  phases. He saw it from many latitudes on both sides of the equator,  and the imagination cannot but follow him with keen interest in his  world-circling tour, keeping his eyes every night fixed upon the  phantasm overhead, whose position shifted with that of the hidden sun.  He demonstrated that the flow extends at times completely across the  celestial dome, although it is relatively faint directly behind the  earth. On his return the government published a large volume of his  observations, in which he undertook to show that the phenomenon was  due to the reflection of sunlight from a ring of meteoric bodies  encircling the earth. But, after all, this elaborate investigation  settled nothing.    Prof. E. E. Barnard has more recently devoted much attention to the  Zodiacal Light, as well as to a strange attendant phenomenon called  the ``Gegenschein,'' or Counterglow, because it always appears at that  point in the sky which is exactly opposite the sun. The Gegenschein is  an extremely elusive phenomenon, suitable only for eyes that have been  specially trained to see it. Professor Newcomb has cautiously remarked  that      it is said that in that point of the heavens directly opposite the    sun there is an elliptical patch of light... This phenomenon is so    difficult to account for that its existence is sometimes doubted;    yet the testimony in its favor is difficult to set aside.    It certainly cannot be set aside at all since the observations of  Barnard. I recall an attempt to see it under his guidance during a  visit to Mount Hamilton, when he was occupied there with the Lick  telescope. Of course, both the Gegenschein and the Zodiacal Light are  too diffuse to be studied with telescopes, which, so to speak, magnify  them out of existence. They can only be successfully studied with the  naked eye, since every faintest glimmer that they afford must be  utilized. This is especially true of the Gegenschein. At Mount  Hamilton, Mr Barnard pointed out to me its location with reference to  certain stars, but with all my gazing I could not be sure that I saw  it. To him, on the contrary, it was obvious; he had studied it for  months, and was able to indicate its shape, its boundaries, its  diameter, and the declination of its center with regard to the  ecliptic. There is not, of course, the shadow of a doubt of the  existence of the Gegenschein, and yet I question if one person in a  million has ever seen or ever will see it. The Zodiacal Light, on the  other hand, is plain enough, provided that the time and the  circumstances of the observation are properly chosen.    In the attempts to explain the Zodiacal Light, the favorite hypothesis  has been that it is an appendage of the sun -- perhaps simply an  extension of the corona in the plane of the ecliptic, which is not  very far from coinciding with that of the sun's equator. This idea is  quite a natural one, because of the evident relation of the light to  the position of the sun. The vast extension of the equatorial wings of  the corona in 1878 gave apparent support to this hypothesis; if the  substance of the corona could extend ten million miles from the sun,  why might it not extend even one hundred million, gradually fading out  beyond the orbit of the earth? A variation of this hypothesis assumes  that the reflection is due to swarms of meteors circling about the  sun, in the plane of its equator, all the way from its immediate  neighborhood to a distance exceeding that of the earth. But in neither  form is the hypothesis satisfactory; there is nothing in the  appearance of the corona to indicate that it extends even as far as  the planet Mercury, while as to meteors, the orbits of the known  swarms do not accord with the hypothesis, and we have no reason to  believe that clouds of others exist traveling in the part of space  where they would have to be in order to answer the requirements of the  theory. The extension of the corona in 1878 did not resemble in its  texture the Zodiacal Light.    Now, it has so often happened in the history of science that an  important discovery in one branch has thrown unexpected but most  welcome light upon some pending problem in some other branch, that a  strong argument might be based upon that fact alone against the too  exclusive devotion of many investigators to the narrow lines of their  own particular specialty; and the Zodiacal Light affords a case in  point, when it is considered in connection with recent discoveries in  chemistry and physics. From the fact that atoms are compound bodies  made up of corpuscles at least a thousand times smaller than the  smallest known atom -- a fact which astounded most men of science when  it was announced a few years ago -- a new hypothesis has been  developed concerning the nature of the Zodiacal Light (as well as  other astronomical riddles), and this hypothesis comes not from an  astronomer, but from a chemist and physicist, the Swede, Svante  Arrhenius. In considering an outline of this new hypothesis we need  neither accept nor reject it; it is a case rather for suspension of  judgment.    To begin with, it carries us back to the ``pressure of light''  mentioned in the preceding chapter. The manner in which this pressure  is believed generally to act was there sufficiently explained, and it  only remains to see how it is theoretically extended to the particles  of matter supposed to constitute the Zodiacal Light. We know that  corpuscles, or ``fragments of atoms'' negatively electrified, are  discharged from hot bodies. Streams of these ``ions'' pour from many  flames and from molten metals; and the impact of the cathode and  ultra-violet rays causes them to gush even from cold bodies. In the  vast laboratory of the sun it is but reasonable to suppose that  similar processes are taking place. ``As a very hot metal emits these  corpuscles,'' says Prof. J. J. Thomson, ``it does not seem an  improbable hypothesis that they are emitted by that very hot body, the  sun.'' Let it be assumed, then, that the sun does emit them; what  happens next? Negatively charged corpuscles, it is known, serve as  nuclei to which particles of matter in the ordinary state are  attracted, and it is probable that those emitted from the sun  immediately pick up loads in this manner and so grow in bulk. If they  grow large enough the gravitation of the sun draws them back, and they  produce a negative charge in the solar atmosphere. But it is probable  that many of the particles do not attain the critical size which,  according to the principles before explained, would enable the  gravitation of the sun to retain them in opposition to the pressure of  the waves of light, and with these particles the light pressure is  dominant. Clouds of them may be supposed to be continually swept away  from the sun into surrounding space, moving mostly in or near the  plane of the solar equator, where the greatest activity, as indicated  by sunspots and related phenomena, is taking place. As they pass  outward into space many of them encounter the earth. If the earth,  like the moon, had no atmosphere the particles would impinge directly  on its surface, giving it a negative electric charge. But the presence  of the atmosphere changes all that, for the first of the flying  particles that encounter it impart to it their negative electricity,  and then, since like electric charges repel like, the storm of  particles following will be sheered off from the earth, and will  stream around it in a maze of hyperbolic paths. Those that continue on  into space beyond the earth may be expected to continue picking up  wandering particles of matter until their bulk has become so great  that the solar attraction prevails again over the light pressure  acting upon them, and they turn again sunward. Passing the earth on  their return they will increase the amount of dust-clouds careering  round it; and these will be further increased by the action of the  ultra-violet rays of the sunlight causing particles to shoot radially  away from the earth when the negative charge of the upper atmosphere  has reached a certain amount, which particles, although starting  sunward, will be swept back to the earth with the oncoming streams. As  the final result of all this accumulation of flying and gyrating  particles in the earth's neighborhood, we are told that the latter  must be transformed into the semblance of a gigantic solid-headed  comet provided with streaming tails, the longest of them stretching  away from the direction of the sun, while another shorter one extends  toward the sun. This shorter tail is due to the particles that we have  just spoken of as being driven sunward from the earth by the action of  ultra-violet light. No doubt this whole subject is too technical for  popular statement; but at any rate the general reader can understand  the picturesque side of the theory, for its advocates assure us that  if we were on the moon we would doubtless be able to see the  comet-like tails of the earth, and then we could appreciate the part  that they play in producing the phenomenon of the Zodiacal Light.    That the Light as we see it could be produced by the reflection of  sunlight from swarms of particles careering round the earth in the  manner supposed by Arrhenius' hypothesis is evident enough; and it  will be observed that the new theory, after all, is only another  variant of the older one which attributes the Zodiacal Light to an  extension of the solar corona. But it differs from the older theory in  offering an explanation of the manner in which the extension is  effected, and it differentiates between the corona proper and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],[0,"Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#18)"],[1,"savages. [58]    At length the sunny days of autumn were gone, and the winter, with its  fierce winds and its penetrating frosts and deep banks of snow, was upon  them. Little occupation could be furnished for the twenty-eight men that  composed the colony. Their idleness soon brought a despondency that hung  like a pall upon their spirits. In February, disease made its approach. It  had not been expected. Every defence within their knowledge had been  provided against it. Their houses were closely sealed and warm; their  clothing was abundant; their food nutritious and plenty. But a diet too  exclusively of salt meat had, notwithstanding, in the opinion of Champlain,  and we may add the want, probably, of exercise and the presence of bad air,  induced the _mal de la terre_ or scurvy, and it made fearful havoc with his  men. Twenty, five out of each seven of their whole number, had been carried  to their graves before the middle of April, and half of the remaining eight  had been attacked by the loathsome scourge.    While the mind of Champlain was oppressed by the suffering and death that  were at all times present in their abode, his sympathies were still further  taxed by the condition of the savages, who gathered in great numbers about  the settlement, in the most abject misery and in the last stages of  starvation. As Champlain could only furnish them, from his limited stores,  temporary and partial relief, it was the more painful to see them slowly  dragging their feeble frames about in the snow, gathering up and devouring  with avidity discarded meat in which the process of decomposition was far  advanced, and which was already too potent with the stench of decay to be  approached by his men.    Beyond the ravages of disease [59] and the starving Indians, Champlain adds  nothing more to complete the gloomy picture of his first winter in Quebec.  The gales of wind that swept round the wall of precipice that protected  them in the rear, the drifts of snow that were piled up in fresh  instalments with every storm about their dwelling, the biting frost, more  piercing and benumbing than they had ever experienced before, the unceasing  groans of the sick within, the semi-weekly procession bearing one after  another of their diminishing numbers to the grave, the mystery that hung  over the disease, and the impotency of all remedies, we know were prominent  features in the picture. But the imagination seeks in vain for more than a  single circumstance that could throw upon it a beam of modifying and  softening light, and that was the presence of the brave Champlain, who bore  all without a murmur, and, we may be sure, without a throb of unmanly fear  or a sensation of cowardly discontent.    But the winter, as all winters do, at length melted reluctantly away, and  the spring came with its verdure, and its new life. The spirits of the  little remnant of a colony began to revive. Eight of the twenty-eight with  which the winter began were still surviving. Four had escaped attack, and  four were rejoicing convalescents.    On the 5th of June, news came that Pont Grave had arrived from France, and  was then at Tadoussac, whither Champlain immediately repaired to confer  with him, and particularly to make arrangements at the earliest possible  moment for an exploring expedition into the interior, an undertaking which  De Monts had enjoined upon him, and which was not only agreeable to his own  wishes, but was a kind of enterprise which had been a passion with him from  his youth.    In anticipation of a tour of exploration during the approaching summer,  Champlain had already ascertained from the Indians that, lying far to the  southwest, was an extensive lake, famous among the savages, containing many  fair islands, and surrounded by a beautiful and productive country. Having  expressed a desire to visit this region, the Indians readily offered to act  as guides, provided, nevertheless, that he would aid them in a warlike raid  upon their enemies, the Iroquois, the tribe known to us as the Mohawks,  whose homes were beyond the lake in question. Champlain without hesitation  acceded to the condition exacted, but with little appreciation, as we  confidently believe, of the bitter consequences that were destined to  follow the alliance thus inaugurated; from which, in after years, it was  inexpedient, if not impossible, to recede.    Having fitted out a shallop, Champlain left Quebec on his tour of  exploration on the 18th of June, 1609, with eleven men, together with a  party of Montagnais, a tribe of Indians who, in their hunting and fishing  excursions, roamed over an indefinite region on the north side of the St.  Lawrence, but whose headquarters were at Tadoussac. After ascending the St  Lawrence about sixty miles, he came upon an encampment of two hundred or  three hundred savages, Hurons [60] and Algonquins, the former dwelling on  the borders of the lake of the same name, the latter on the upper waters of  the Ottawa. They had learned something of the French from a son of one of  their chiefs, who had been at Quebec the preceding autumn, and were now on  their way to enter into an alliance with the French against the Iroquois.  After formal negotiations and a return to Quebec to visit the French  settlement and witness the effect of their firearms, of which they had  heard and which greatly excited their curiosity, and after the usual  ceremonies of feasting and dancing, the whole party proceeded up the river  until they reached the mouth of the Richelieu. Here they remained two days,  as guests of the Indians, feasting upon fish, venison, and water-fowl.    While these festivities were in progress, a disagreement arose among the  savages, and the bulk of them, including the women, returned to their  homes. Sixty warriors, however, some from each of the three allied tribes,  proceeded up the Richelieu with Champlain. At the Falls of Chambly, finding  it impossible for the shallop to pass them, he directed the pilot to return  with it to Quebec, leaving only two men from the crew to accompany him on  the remainder of the expedition. From this point, Champlain and his two  brave companions entrusted themselves to the birch canoe of the savages.  For a short distance, the canoes, twenty-four in all, were transported by  land. The fall and rapids, extending as far as St. John, were at length  passed. They then proceeded up the river, and, entering the lake which now  bears the name of Champlain, crept along the western bank, advancing after  the first few days only in the night, hiding themselves during the day in  the thickets on the shore to avoid the observation of their enemies, whom  they were now liable at any moment to meet.    On the evening of the 29th of July, at about ten o'clock, when the allies  were gliding noiselessly along in restrained silence, as they approached  the little cape that juts out into the lake at Ticonderoga, near where Fort  Carillon was afterwards erected by the French, and where its ruins are  still to be seen, [61] they discovered a flotilla of heavy canoes, of oaken  bark, containing not far from two hundred Iroquois warriors, armed and  impatient for conflict. A furor and frenzy as of so many enraged tigers  instantly seized both parties. Champlain and his allies withdrew a short  distance, an arrow's range from the shore, fastening their canoes by poles  to keep them together, while the Iroquois hastened to the water's edge,  drew up their canoes side by side, and began to fell trees and construct a  barricade, which they were well able to accomplish with marvellous facility  and skill. Two boats were sent out to inquire if the Iroquois desired to  fight, to which they replied that they wanted nothing so much, and, as it  was now dark, at sunrise the next morning they would give them battle. The  whole night was spent by both parties in loud and tumultuous boasting,  berating each other in the roundest terms which their savage vocabulary  could furnish, insultingly charging each other with cowardice and weakness,  and declaring that they would prove the truth of their assertions to their  utter ruin the next morning.    When the sun began to gild the distant mountain-tops, the combatants were  ready for the fray. Champlain and his two companions, each lying low in  separate canoes of the Montagnais, put on, as best they could, the light  armor in use at that period, and, taking the short hand-gun, or arquebus,  went on shore, concealing themselves as much as possible from the enemy. As  soon as all had landed, the two parties hastily approached each other,  moving with a firm and determined tread. The allies, who had become fully  aware of the deadly character of the hand-gun and were anxious to see an  exhibition of its mysterious power, promptly opened their ranks, and  Champlain marched forward in front, until he was within thirty paces of the  Iroquois. When they saw him, attracted by his pale face and strange armor,  they halted and gazed at him in a calm bewilderment for some seconds. Three  Iroquois chiefs, tall and athletic, stood in front, and could be easily  distinguished by the lofty plumes that waved above their heads. They began  at once to make ready for a discharge of arrows. At the same instant,  Champlain, perceiving this movement, levelled his piece, which had been  loaded with four balls, and two chiefs fell dead, and another savage was  mortally wounded by the same shot. At this, the allies raised a shout  rivalling thunder in its stunning effect. From both sides the whizzing  arrows filled the air. The two French arquebusiers, from their ambuscade in  the thicket, immediately attacked in flank, pouring a deadly fire upon the  enemy's right. The explosion of the firearms, altogether new to the  Iroquois, the fatal effects that instantly followed, their chiefs lying  dead at their feet and others fast falling, threw them into a tumultuous  panic."]]]
