The distance was eight or ten miles.    I was standing near the edge of the open scrub, with the reins over my arm.  The mare was famished and exhausted.  The bells were almost silent,  for the bullocks stood still in the agony of thirst.  The weather was hot;  and they had barely sipped the alkaline water at last camp.  I was absently observing one white bullock close by, when,  with a low bellow, he suddenly darted forward eight or ten yards,  and began drinking at the gilgie.  That bellow was answered from all sides;  and in two minutes his nineteen mates were sharing the discovery.  Meanwhile, I had let Fancy go amongst them, after putting on her bell,  and taking off the saddle and bridle.  I had done with her for the night.  And I knew that the water was good, for all the beasts stood on the brink,  and drank without wetting their feet.    But how had the first bullock found the water, after he and his mates  had passed it a dozen times, and within a few yards?  This was worth investigating at once.  So, before thinking about supper,  I went to the exact spot where the beast had been standing,  and there saw the stars reflected in the water.  Of course,  if it had been anything like a permanent supply, the sound of frogs  or yabbies would have guided the beasts to it at once.  But even wild cattle can no more scent water than we can,  though they make better use of such faculties as they possess.  I have tested the supposition deliberately and exhaustively,  time after time; and this instance is cited, not controversially,  but because it has to do with the present memoir.    However, next morning--after verifying the tracks of the thirsty bullocks  so near the gilgie that it seemed a wonder they hadn't walked into it--  I looked for the clump of mallee.  I don't believe there was a stick of it  within miles; but there was a clump of yarran where it should have been.  A stately beefwood, sixty feet high, with swarthy column  furrowed a hand-breadth deep, and heavy tufts of foliage like bundles  of long leeks in colour and configuration--the first beefwood I had seen  since leaving the homestead--stood close to the water, making a fine landmark;  but Dan's sense of proportion had selected the adjacent bit of yarran;  and--as I told the breakfast-party--he had never concerned himself  to know the difference between yarran and mallee.    \"Curious combination of a fool and a well-informed man,\" remarked Ward.    \"Is he either of the two?\" asked Broome.  \"My belief, he shams both.\"    \"Easy matter to sham foolishness,\" obsened Williamson. \"Not so easy  to sham information.\"    \"Any relation to the late Liberator?\" I asked.    \"Dan O'Connell's only his nickname,\" replied Andrews.  \"His proper name  is Rory O'Halloran.'    \"Rory O'Halloran!\" I repeated.  \"I thought I had met him before,  but could n't place him.  And so Rory has found his way here?\"    \"Well, he was brought here,\" replied Andrews.  \"Twelve or fourteen years ago  he turned up at Moogoojinna, down Deniliquin way, and froze to the station.  Then when Arbuthnot settled this place--five years ago now--  Spanker brought Rory with him, and he's been here ever since.  Got married at Moogoojinna, a year or two before leaving,  to a red-hot Protestant, from the same part of the globe as himself;  but she stayed at Moogoojinna for her confinement, and only came up  four years ago, after Dan was settled in the Utopia paddock.  Good woman in her way; but she spends her time in a sort of steady fury,  for she came to Moogoojinna with the idea of collaring something worth while.  So Spanker says; and he was there at the time.  Seems she did n't want Dan,  and Dan did n't want her, but somehow they were married before they came  to an understanding.  He's very good to her, in his own inoffensive way;  and she leads him a dog's life.  One kid.  Likely you knew him on Moogoojinna.  According to his own account, he came straight through Vic.,  only stopping once, when he chummied for a few weeks with a squatter  that took a fancy to him and treated him like a long-lost brother.  Grain of salt just there.\"    \"Not necessarily,\" I replied.  \"I can verify his statement to the letter,  for I was that land-cormorant.\" And I straightway unfolded to the boys  an earlier page of Dan O'Connell's history----    It was about thirteen years before.  At that time I was really suffering  the embarrassment of riches, though the latter consisted only of those  chastening experiences which daily confront adventurers of immature judgment  and scanty resources, on new selections.  The local storekeeper, however,  was keeping me supplied with the luxuries of life--such as flour, spuds, tea,  sugar, tobacco--whilst turkeys and ducks were to be had for the shooting,  and kangaroos for the chasing.  The storekeeper had also taken charge  of my land license, for safety, and occasionally presented documents  for my signature, making me feel like some conscious criminal,  happily let off for the present with a caution.    One summer evening, whilst dragging myself home from work,  I encountered a young fellow, who, I flattered myself, resembled me  only in age.  Soft as a cabbage in every way, he was footsore and weary,  as well as homesick and despondent to the verge of tears.  In one hand  he carried a carpet bag, and in the other a large bundle, tied up  in a coloured handkerchief.  In his conversation he employed the Armagh accent  with such slavish fidelity as to make it evident that he regarded  any other form of speech as showing culpable ignorance  or offensive affectation.  His name was Rory O'Halloran.    Of course, I offered him the rugged hospitalities of my hut.  In the morning, perceiving that his feet showed startling traces  of the hundred-and-twenty-mile walk from Melbourne, I constrained him  to rest for a few days.  But the poor fellow had a painfully outspoken scruple  against eating the damper of idleness; so, as soon as he was able  to get his boots on without supplication for Divine support,  he started to help me with my work.    Soon our acquaintance ripened to intimacy; and I learned something  of his history.  Like the majority of us, he was the scion  of an ancient family.  He was the youngest of eleven, all surviving  at latest advices (praise God).  Seven of these had swarmed to America,  and were doing well (glory be); two remained in their native hive,  with full and plenty (Amen); whilst he and his brother Larry  had staked their future on the prosperity of Australia (God help us).    His father must have been a man of wealth and position, as he apparently spent  his whole time in following the hounds, shooting pheasants,  and catching salmon, with the other gentlemen.  But just before Rory left home,  his father and mother had withdrawn from society.  And here  the narrator's sudden reticence warned me not to inquire into the details  of the old couple's retirement.    Larry, it appeared, had been doing Victoria and Riverina for five or six years,  with magnificent, though unspecific, results.  Anyway, he had franked Rory  to Port Melbourne pier by passage warrant; but seemed to have made no provision  for further intercourse.  And Rory, having walked the streets of Melbourne  for two whole days without finding any trace of Larry, had concluded  that he must be in Riverina, and that it would be a brave notion to slip over,  and take the defaulter by surprise.  Hence his present pilgrimage.    Poor Rory, in spite of his willingness, was naturally awkward  with the splitters' tools, nor did he know how to harness a horse.  All this, he explained to me, was a penalty adherent to people who,  by reason of their social-economic position, are emancipated  from manual labour.  But when a heavy, soaking pour of summer rain  brought the ground into fencing condition, I noticed that he could handle  the spade with a strength and dexterity rarely equalled within my observation.    \"You're a Catholic--are n't you, Rory?\" I speculated, one evening,  struck by the simple piety of some asinine remark he had made.    A startled look of remonstrance and deprecation was his only reply.  However, as it has always been my rule to seek information at first hand,  I tried, in a friendly and confidential way, to draw him out  respecting certain of his Church's usages and tenets, which I knew  to be garbled and falsified by Protestant bigotry.  But it was evident  that throughout every fibre of his moral nature there ran a conviction  that the mere mention of Purgatory or Transubstantiation would be fatal  to our friendship.  And he, at all events, would be no party  to the unmasking of that great gulf which hereditarily divided us.    [It may be worth while, before we go any farther, to inquire into the nature  and origin of this gulf--not merely for the sake of information,  but because it is a question which affects the moral health of our community.    When Australia was first colonised, any sensible man might have foreboded  sorrel, cockspur, Scotch thistle, &c., as unwelcome, but unavoidable,  adjuncts of settlement.  A many-wintered sage might have predicted  that some colonist, in a fit of criminal folly, would scourge the country  with a legacy of foxes, rabbits, sparrows, &c.  But a second  and clearer-sighted Jeremiah could never have prophesied  the deliberate introduction of hydrophobia for dogs, glanders for horses,  or Orangeism for men.  Yet the latter enterprise has been carried out--  whether by John Smith or John Beelzebub, by the Rev. Jones  or the Rev. Belphegor, it matters not now.  Some one has carried  his congenial virus half-way round the globe, and tainted a young nation.    It is no question of doctrine.  There is a greater difference between  the Presbyterian and Episcopalian creeds than between the latter  and the Catholic.  But in tracing sectarian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#18)"],[1,"that be whole need  not a physician, but they that are sick. I am not come to call the  righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" Matt. 9:12, 13. By this declaration  the Lord teaches us, that he indeed calls sinners, but that he calls them  to _repentance_; whence it is evident, that no man can come to Christ  without true repentance and conversion from sin, and without a true faith.    2. Now repentance consists in dying unto sin through true sorrow for our  sins, and in obtaining the remission of sins through faith and living unto  righteousness in Christ. There is no real repentance unless a genuine  godly sorrow is first experienced, by which the heart is broken and the  flesh crucified. Hence it is termed \"repentance from dead works\" (Heb.  6:1); or the renunciation of such works as issue in death. To abstain from  dead works is, therefore, one of the principal parts of true repentance.    3. If we be not the subjects of this repentance, the merit of Christ  profits us nothing; nor can we lay the smallest claim to the benefits  which thence accrue; for Christ proffers his aid, as the physician of  souls, and his blood, as the only effectual medicine for our spiritual  maladies.    4. But as not even the most precious remedy can effect a cure of a  disorder unless the patient refrain from things that are hurtful in their  tendency, and that resist the operation of the medicine, so the blood and  death of Christ will be of no avail to him who does not fully resolve to  forsake his sins, and to live up to the requirements of the gospel; for  St. Paul says: \"They who do such things (the works of the flesh), shall  not inherit the kingdom of God,\" and, of course, have not any part in the  Lord Jesus Christ. Gal. 5:21.    5. Again, if Christ, by his most precious blood, is to become our  medicine, it cannot be doubted that we must be in a diseased state, and  that we must, for ourselves, _feel_ that we are so. The whole need not a  physician, but the sick only (Matt. 9:12); and none is spiritually sick  (at least so as to be conscious of it) who does not experience unfeigned  contrition for the sins which he has committed, and who has not a sense of  the indignation of God which is excited against them. He is no proper  patient for the physician of souls who avoids not worldly lusts and  vanities, honors and riches; but goes on in a state of spiritual  unconcern, without any regard to his past life or his final salvation.  Upon a man of this character, no cure can possibly be wrought. He does not  see his distemper, and therefore needs no physician. In short, Christ  profits him nothing, and his merits leave no saving effect upon his soul.    6. Remember, therefore, O man! that Christ is come to call _sinners to  repentance_; and that it is only such as are broken in heart and contrite  in spirit; only such as fervently desire and thirst after this  righteousness that are in a condition to receive the saving influence of  the blood, death, and merits of the Lord Jesus.    7. Happy is he who feels in his heart, and still more happy he who proves  obedient to this holy calling, that is, the \"godly sorrow for sin, which  worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of,\" and which is the  work of the Holy Spirit himself. It arises, first, from the _law_, and  from serious meditation on the _passion_ of Christ, which abounds with  loud invitations to unfeigned repentance. It exhibits, as in a mirror,  both the wrath of God against sin, and also his infinite grace in saving  the sinner. To make an atonement for our sins, Jesus shed his blood; and  love induced him to die for us while we were yet sinners. Rom. 5:8. Here  the divine justice and clemency combine for the salvation of souls.    8. How is it possible that a man who believes in Christ, should continue  in sins which the Lord expiated at no less a price than his own most  precious blood? When, therefore, O man! thou art tempted to pride and  ambition, reflect upon the contempt and humiliation to which Jesus  submitted in order to atone for thy pride and thy ambition. When thou art  covetous after this world, think of the poverty which he underwent that he  might make satisfaction for thy cupidity; and, surely, this will  extinguish in thee the love of money and of worldly estates. What anguish  and agony did Christ suffer on account of thy lusts and sinful pleasures;  and art thou yet in pursuit of these pleasures that will leave behind them  a mortal sting? Alas! how great must be the corruption of our nature when  we can delight in things for which our Redeemer and Lord was sorrowful  even unto death! Christ died to expiate thy wrath, hatred, and enmity; to  atone for thy bitterness and rancor, for thy love of revenge, and the  implacableness of thy spirit. This he effected by his extreme mildness and  patience, mercy and long-suffering. And wilt thou be angry on every  trifling occasion, and esteem revenge to be sweet, when, to atone for it,  thy Redeemer drank to the very dregs the cup of bitterness and affliction?    9. Truly as many as assume to themselves the name of Christians, and yet  do not forsake the pleasures of sin, \"crucify Christ to themselves  _afresh_, and put him to an open shame\" (Heb. 6:6); and it is, therefore,  utterly impossible that they should partake of that merit which they tread  under foot. They pollute the blood of the everlasting covenant, and do not  believe that their sins are expiated by it. They do \"despite unto the  Spirit of grace;\" they despise and resist him; and, by their ungodly  lives, scorn and condemn the grace of God offered in Christ Jesus. Heb.  10:29. Hence, the blood of the Saviour, which was shed for their sakes,  cries aloud for vengeance against them; and this it does by the righteous  judgment of God, which they thus draw down upon themselves,--a  consideration that ought to strike a terror into every one that names the  name of Christ. Indeed, \"it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of  the living God\" (Heb. 10:31); for he is a _living_ God, and not a lifeless  idol, incapable of punishing so scornful a contempt of his grace and  mercy.    10. With this divine wrath and vengeance, even their own consciences  threaten them, as inevitably following those who (though they know that it  was to atone for sin that the Son of God died so ignominious a death) are  yet not careful to put away their sins.    11. It was for this reason that, soon after the death of Christ,  repentance was preached over all the world; namely, both because he died  \"for the sins of the whole world\" (1 John 2:2); and because _in all  places_ of the world men should repent. Acts 17:30. Thus it is said, \"God  now commandeth all men _every where_ to repent,\" and to receive with a  contrite, penitent, and believing heart the sovereign medicine purchased  by the death of Christ, in order that the grace of God be not frustrated,  but answer the end designed.    12. Remission of sins immediately follows true repentance; but how shall a  man have his sins remitted when he does not repent of them, nay, when he  still rejoices in them? Nothing surely could be more preposterous than to  expect that sins should be pardoned which a man has no design to renounce;  and nothing can be more absurd than to seek consolation in the sufferings  of Christ, and yet continue in the mire of sin which caused Christ's  death.    13. But certain and obvious as these truths are in themselves, there are  many that call themselves Christians who never repented, and who yet will  presume to lay claim to a share in the merits of Christ, and in the  remission of sins which he has purchased. They have not ceased to indulge  their accustomed wrath, covetousness, pride, malice, envy, hypocrisy, and  unrighteousness, but have rather become more and more enslaved by them;  and yet, alas! they expect forgiveness of sin, and presumptuously apply to  themselves the merits of Christ as a defence against the impending  judgment of Almighty God. And though this is one of the grossest and most  palpable of errors, yet they do not hesitate to bestow upon it the  specious name of _faith_, by which they hope for salvation. These are they  that flatter themselves to their own destruction; fondly supposing that  they are true Christians because they have a speculative knowledge of the  Gospel, and because they believe that Jesus died for their sins. This,  alas! is not _faith_, but _fancy_; and thou art an unhappy, and most  awfully infatuated _false Christian_, if thou canst suffer thyself to be  deluded in this manner! Never did the Word of God teach such a doctrine;  but the unvarying language of the inspired writers is: \"If thou earnestly  desirest the pardon of thy sins, _repent_ of them, and firmly resolve to  give up the practice of them; and thus, grieving from thy heart that thou  hast so greatly offended God, and determining to lead a new life, believe  on Jesus Christ, the great propitiation for the sins of the whole world.\"    14. But how should that man feel sorrow for his sins, who will not be  induced to quit them? and how should he quit them, while he remains  unconcerned about committing them? Christ, and all his apostles and  prophets, unite in teaching thee, O man! that thou must die to the world  and to thy sins; die to thy pride, thy covetousness, thy lust, and thy  wrath; and that thou must return to the Lord with all thy heart, and  implore his gracious pardon. And this being sincerely done, thou art  absolved, and thy sins are forgiven. _Then_, the heavenly physician looks  upon thee graciously; for he is come to revive those that are of a  contrite spirit, and to bind up the broken in heart. Ps. 147:3. But if  thou seekest for some other way to be saved, than that which is here  pointed out, then Christ will profit thee nothing, and the boasting of thy  faith is altogether vain. For _true_ faith renews him who possesses it; it  mortifies sin, "]]]
