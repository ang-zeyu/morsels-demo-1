If she comes back to us, it must be of her own free will. We  have done our part.\"    \"Can we do anything to help you, Anne?\" asked Grace.    \"Yes,\" replied Anne, looking ruefully at the overflowing trunk. \"You can  all come over and sit upon this trunk. I never shall get the lid down  any other way.\"    This having been successfully accomplished, the three girls took leave  of Anne, who promised to be on hand for a final session that night at  Grace's.    Before eight o'clock the next morning Anne departed for New York, laden  with flowers, magazines and candy, bestowed upon her by the Phi Sigma  Tau, who had risen before daybreak in order to be in time to see her  off. She had purposely chosen an early train, as she wished to arrive in  New York before the darkness of the winter evening closed in.    Mr. Southard and his sister were to meet her at the Jersey station, but  careful little soul that she was, Anne decided that in case anything  unforeseen arose to prevent their coming, she would have less difficulty  in finding her way about in daylight.    \"Take good care of yourself, Anne,\" commanded Nora, patting Anne on the  shoulder.    \"You do the same,\" replied Anne. \"Don't forget that theatre party,  either.\"    \"We'll be there,\" Grace assured her, as she followed Anne up the aisle  with her suit case. \"By the way, Anne, here's my sweater. I thought you  might need it during rehearsals. The stage is likely to be draughty.\"    \"Grace Harlowe, you are too good to me,\" murmured Anne, as she  reluctantly took the package that Grace thrust into her unwilling hands.    \"All aboard,\" shouted the brakeman, and with a hasty kiss Grace hurried  down the steps to join her friends, who stood on the station platform  waving their farewells to the brown-eyed girl who was to separate from  them for the first time since the beginning of their High School career.    The days slipped quickly away, and the girl chums heard frequently from  Anne, who had arrived at her destination in safety, was met by the  Southards and carried off to their comfortable home. She was enjoying  every minute of her stay, she wrote them, and every one was very kind to  her. Miss Southard was a dear, and she was looking forward to the visit  of the Phi Sigma Tau with almost as much enthusiasm as Anne herself.    The boys had been duly informed of Anne's good fortune, and the Saturday  of the third week of Anne's engagement had been the date fixed upon for  the theatre party. Tom Gray would bring Arnold Evans. Hippy, David and  Reddy would join them in New York. Then the five boys would repair to  the hotel where the girls were to stop, accompanied by Mrs. Gibson and  James Gardiner, who was again invited to make the number even.    Intense excitement prevailed in school when it was learned that the Phi  Sigma Tau were to go to New York to see Anne as \"Rosalind,\" and the five  girls were carried upon the top wave of popularity.    Marian and Eleanor alone remained aloof, evincing no outward interest in  the news, although both thought rather enviously of the good time in New  York that awaited the girls they had repudiated.    The eventful Saturday came at last, and the five girls, chaperoned by  Mrs. Gibson, with James Gardiner for a bodyguard, boarded the same  express that had carried Anne off and were whirled away to the  metropolis.    As soon as they arrived in New York they were conveyed by taxicabs to  their hotel and on entering the reception room were hailed with delight  by the boys, who had arrived only half an hour before. While they were  busily engaged in exchanging news, Anne hurried in from a rehearsal, was  seized by Grace, then passed from one to the other until, freeing  herself, she said, laughing:    \"Do let me stand still for a second. I haven't had a really good look at  any of you yet.\"    \"What do you mean by becoming a Shakespearian star without consulting me  first!\" demanded David, with mock severity, although there was a rather  wistful look in his eyes as they looked into Anne's. David preferred to  keep Anne the little High School girl he had known for the past three  years. Theatrical stars were somewhat out of his firmament.    \"Don't worry,\" Anne assured him. \"It's only for three more weeks. I'll  be back in Oakdale in plenty of time to finish up my senior year with  the girls.\"    \"Anne, you haven't any idea of how much we have missed you,\" cried Nora.  \"We can't get used to being without you.\"    \"I've missed you, too,\" responded Anne who stood with Grace's arm around  her, smiling lovingly at her little circle of friends.    \"Of course I have had a good many rehearsals--one every day, and  sometimes two--so the time has fairly raced by; but when the play is  over and I am on the way home at night, then I think of all of you, and  it seems as though I must take the next train back to Oakdale.\"    \"Do let me talk,\" interposed Hippy, who had hitherto been devoting his  attention to Nora. \"No one knows how I long to be back in Oakdale, fair  village of my birth, home of the chafing dish and the cheerful chocolate  cream. 'Tis there that the friends of my youth flourish, and the grass  green banner of O'Malley waves. Take me back; oh, take me--\"    \"You will be taken away back and set down with a jar in about two  seconds if you are seized with another of those spells,\" promised Tom  Gray, turning a withering glance upon Hippy.    \"What sort of jar,\" asked Hippy, with an interested grin. \"A cooky jar  or merely a glass candy jar? Be sure you make it a full one.\"    \"It will be a full one,\" replied Tom with emphasis, \"and will last you  for a long time.\"    \"I don't believe I'll take up with your proposition,\" said Hippy  hastily. \"There is something about the tone of your voice that makes my  spinal column vibrate with nervous apprehension. I think I had better  confine my conversation strictly to Nora. She is sympathetic and also  skilled in argument.\"    With this, he took Nora by the arm and would have marched her out of the  group had she not protested so vigorously that he turned from her in  disgust and began questioning James Gardiner as to how he managed to  survive the journey and what methods he had used to insure good behavior  on the part of his charges, much to the embarrassment of that youth, who  was anything but a \"ladies' man.\"    \"My dear young people,\" finally said Mrs. Gibson, laughingly, \"this  impromptu reception is liable to last all night unless it is checked by  a stern hand. It is almost five o'clock, and we haven't even seen our  rooms yet. Besides, Anne will have to leave before long for the theatre.  Let us hurry with our dressing, order an early dinner and keep Anne here  for it. Shall you be able to stay?\" she asked, turning to Anne.    \"I think so,\" replied Anne. \"I do not have to be in the theatre until  after seven. But I am not dressed for dinner,\" she added, looking  doubtfully at her street costume. \"You see, I came straight from  rehearsal.\"    \"Never mind, Anne,\" interposed Grace, \"you are a star, and stars have  the privilege of doing as they choose. At least that's what the Sunday  papers say. Miriam and I are going to room together. Come up with us.\"    Mrs. Gibson had engaged rooms ahead for her party, and the girls soon  found themselves in very luxurious quarters, with a trim maid on hand to  attend to their wants.    The boys had engaged rooms on the floor above that occupied by Mrs.  Gibson and the Phi Sigma Tau. James Gardiner heaved a sigh of relief as  he deposited his suit case beside Tom's in the room to which they had  been assigned.    \"Girls are an awful responsibility,\" he remarked gloomily, with a  care-worn expression that made Tom shout with laughter. \"I like them all  right enough, but not in bunches.\"    By making a special effort, the party was ready by six o'clock to  descend to dinner, which was served to them in a private dining room,  Mrs. Gibson having thoughtfully made this arrangement, in order to give  the young folks as much time together as possible.    They made a pretty picture as they sat at the round table, the delicate  finery of the girls gaining in effect from the sombre evening coats of  the boys. Mrs. Gibson, gowned in white silk with an overdress of black  chiffon, sat at the head of the table and did the honors of the  occasion.    \"I feel frightfully out of place in this company of chivalry and  beauty,\" Anne remarked, looking fondly about her at the friends whose  presence told more plainly than words could have done the place she  occupied in their hearts.    \"Think how we shall fade into insignificance to-night when you hold  forth with the great Southard,\" retorted Nora. \"I shall consider myself  honored by even a mere bow from you, after you have taken curtain calls  before a New York audience.\"    \"When I was with Edwin Booth,\" began Hippy reminiscently, \"he often said  to me, 'Hippy, my boy, my acting is nothing compared to yours. You  are--'\"    \"A first cousin to Ananias and Sapphira,\" finished David derisively.    \"Never heard of them,\" replied Hippy unabashed. \"Not branches of our  family tree. As I was saying--\"    \"Never mind what you were saying,\" said Nora in cutting tones. \"Listen  to me. It is seven o'clock. Anne must go, and in a taxicab, at that.\"    \"Where shall we see you after the performance, dear?\" asked Grace.    \"Mr. Southard has obtained special permission for all of you to go  behind the scenes after the play.\"    \"How lovely!\" cried the girls.    \"My curiosity will at last be satisfied. I have always wanted to go  behind the scenes of a New York theatre,\" remarked Mrs. Gibson.    \"I have the dearest dressing room,\" said Anne, with enthusiasm. \"Mr. and  Miss Southard are going "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#18)"],[1,"to thee.    BRÜNNHILDE        On Siegfried? Thou?            [_Smiling bitterly._        One single flash      Of his eye and its lightning--  Which streamed in its glory on me  Even through his disguise--      And thy heart would fail,      Shorn of its courage.    HAGEN        But to my spear      His perjury gives him.    BRÜNNHILDE        Truth and falsehood--      What matter words!      To arm thy spear      Seek for something stronger,  Strength such as his to withstand!    HAGEN        Well know I Siegfried's      Conquering strength:  How hard in battle to slay him;      But whisper to me      Some sure device  For speeding him to his doom.    BRÜNNHILDE    Ungrateful, shameful return!      I taught him all      The arts I know,  To preserve his body from harm.      [Illustration:    \"O wife betrayed,   I will avenge   Thy trust deceived\"   See p. 154  ]          He bears unwitting      A charmèd life  And safely walks by spells enwound.    HAGEN    Then no weapon forged could wound him?    BRÜNNHILDE    In battle none;--yet--  Did the blow strike his back!      Never--I knew that--      Would he give way,  Or turn and fly, the foe pursuing,  So there I gave him no blessing.    HAGEN    And there shall my spear strike!            [_He turns quickly from Brünnhilde to Gunther._        Up, Gunther,      Noble Gibichung!  Here stands thy valiant wife.  Why hang thy head in grief?    GUNTHER            [_Starting up passionately._        O shame!      Dishonour!      Woe is me!  No man has known such sorrow!    HAGEN        In shame thou liest--      That is true.    BRÜNNHILDE [_To Gunther._        O craven man!      Falsest of friends!      Hidden behind      The hero wert thou      While won were for thee      The prize and the glory.      Low indeed      The race must have sunk  That breeds such cowards as thou!    GUNTHER [_Beside himself._    Deceived am I--and deceiver!  Betrayed am I--and betrayer!  My strength be consumed,  And broken my heart!      Help, Hagen!      Help for my honour!      Help, for my mother was thine--  Thee too she bore!    HAGEN        No help from head      Or hand will suffice:  'Tis Siegfried's death we need.    GUNTHER [_Seized with horror._    Siegfried's death?    HAGEN    Unpurged else were thy shame.    GUNTHER [_Staring before him._        Blood-brotherhood      He and I swore.    HAGEN        Who broke the bond      Pays with his blood.    GUNTHER        Broke he the bond?    HAGEN        In betraying thee.    GUNTHER        Was I betrayed?    BRÜNNHILDE        He betrayed thee,  And me ye all are betraying!      If I were just,      All the blood of the world  Would not atone for your guilt!      But the death of one      Is all I ask for.      Dying, Siegfried  Atones for himself and you!    HAGEN            [_Turning to Gunther and speaking to him secretly._    His death would profit thee;  Boundless were indeed thy might  If thou couldst capture the ring,  Which, alive, he never will yield.    GUNTHER [_Softly._        Brünnhilde's ring?    HAGEN        The ring the Niblung wrought.    GUNTHER [_Sighing deeply._    'Twould be the end of Siegfried.    HAGEN    His death would serve us all.    GUNTHER        But Gutrun', to whom      He has been given!  How could we look in her face  If her husband we had slain?    BRÜNNHILDE [_Starting up furiously._        What wisdom forewarned of,      And runes hinted darkly,      In helpless despair      Is plain to me now.            [_Passionately._    Gutrune is the spell  That stole my husband's heart away!      Woe be her lot!    HAGEN [_To Gunther._    If this grief we must give her,  Conceal how Siegfried died.      We go to-morrow      Merrily hunting;  The hero gallops ahead;  We find him slain by a boar.    BRÜNNHILDE and HAGEN        So shall it be!      Perish Siegfried!      Purged be the shame      He brought on me!      Faith sworn by oath      He has broken;      Now with his blood      Let him atone!      Avenging,      All-hearing God!      Oath-witness,      And lord of vows!  Wotan, come at my call!      Send thou thine awful      Heavenly host      Hither to hear      While I vow revenge!    HAGEN        Doomed let him die,      The hero renowned!      Mine is the hoard,      And mine I shall hold it!      From him the ring      Shall be wrested!        Niblung father!      O fallen prince!      Night warder!      Nibelung lord!  Alberich! Hear thou thy son!      Ruling again      O'er the Nibelung host,      Bid them obey thee,      The ring's dread lord!            [_As Gunther turns impetuously towards the hall          with Brünnhilde they are met by the bridal          procession coming out. Boys and girls, waving          flower-wreathed staves, leap merrily in front.          The vassals are carrying Siegfried on a shield          and Gutrune on a seat. On the rising ground          at the back men-servants and maids are taking          implements and beasts for sacrifice, by the          various mountain-paths, to the altars, which they          deck with flowers. Siegfried and the vassals blow          wedding-calls on their horns. The women invite          Brünnhilde to accompany them to Gutrune's side.          Brünnhilde stares blankly at Gutrune, who beckons          her with a friendly smile. As Brünnhilde is about          to step back angrily Hagen comes quickly between          them and presses her towards Gunther, who takes          her hand again, whereupon he allows himself to be          raised on a shield by the men. As the procession,          scarcely interrupted, moves on quickly again          towards the height, the curtain falls._    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE THIRD ACT          _A wild wooded and rocky valley on the Rhine,      which flows past a steep cliff in the background.

[_They sing and again start swimming and circling          about. They pause and listen, then merrily splash          the waters._        O sun,  The hero quickly send us  Who again our gold shall give us!      If it were ours,      We should no longer  Envy thine eye for its splendour.      Rhinegold!      Gleaming gold!  How glad was thy radiance,  Glorious star of the waters!
