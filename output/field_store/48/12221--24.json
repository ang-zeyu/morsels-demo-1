This was his first service. If the glory was  too bright for his eyes to bear, if he staggered under the trance of  delight, the more excellent is the spectacle he saw, the realities of  being which beam and blaze through him, and which no infirmities of  the prophet are suffered to obscure; and he renders a second passive  service to men, not less than the first,--perhaps, in the great circle  of being, and in the retributions of spiritual nature, not less glorious  or less beautiful to himself.          IV. MONTAIGNE; OR, THE SKEPTIC.      Every fact is related on one side to sensation and, on the other, to  morals. The game of thought is, on the appearance of one of these two  sides, to find the other; given the upper, to find the under side.  Nothing so thin, but has these two faces; and, when the observer has  seen the obverse, he turns it over to see the reverse.    Life is a pitching of this penny,--heads or tails. We never tire of  this game, because there is still a slight shudder of astonishment at  the exhibition of the other face, at the contrast of the two faces.  A man is flushed with success, and bethinks himself what this good  luck signifies. He drives his bargain in the street; but it occurs  that he also is bought and sold. He sees the beauty of a human face,  and searches the cause of that beauty, which must be more beautiful.  He builds his fortunes, maintains the laws, cherishes his children;  but he asks himself, why? and whereto? This head and this tail are  called, in the language of philosophy, Infinite and Finite; Relative  and Absolute; Apparent and Real; and many fine names beside.    Each man is born with a predisposition to one or the other of these  sides of nature; and it will easily happen that men will be found  devoted to one or the other. One class has the perception of difference,  and is conversant with facts and surfaces; cities and persons; and the  bringing certain things to pass;--the men of talent and action. Another  class have the perception of identity, and are men of faith and  philosophy, men of genius.    Each of these riders drives too fast. Plotinus believes only in  philosophers; Fenelon, in saints; Pindar and Byron, in poets. Read the  haughty language in which Plato and the Platonists speak of all men  who are not devoted to their own shining abstractions: other men are  rats and mice. The literary class is usually proud and exclusive. The  correspondence of Pope and Swift describes mankind around them as  monsters; and that of Goethe and Schiller, in our own time, is scarcely  more kind.    It is easy to see how this arrogance comes. The genius is a genius by  the first look he casts on any object. Is his eye creative? Does he  not rest in angles and colors, but beholds the design--he will presently  undervalue the actual object. In powerful moments, his thought has  dissolved the works of art and nature into their causes, so that the  works appear heavy and faulty. He has a conception of beauty which the  sculptor cannot embody. Picture, statue, temple, railroad, steam-engine,  existed first in an artist's mind, without flaw, mistake, or friction,  which impair the executed models. So did the church, the state, college,  court, social circle, and all the institutions. It is not strange that  these men, remembering what they have seen and hoped of ideas, should  affirm disdainfully the superiority of ideas. Having at some time seen  that the happy soul will carry all the arts in power, they say, Why  cumber ourselves with superfluous realizations? and, like dreaming  beggars, they assume to speak and act as if these values were already  substantiated.    On the other part, the men of toil and trade and luxury,--the animal  world, including the animal in the philosopher and poet also,--and the  practical world, including the painful drudgeries which are never  excused to philosopher or poet any more than to the rest,--weigh heavily  on the other side. The trade in our streets believes in no metaphysical  causes, thinks nothing of the force which necessitated traders and a  trading planet to exist; no, but sticks to cotton, sugar, wool, and  salt. The ward meetings, on election days, are not softened by any  misgivings of the value of these ballotings. Hot life is streaming in  a single direction. To the men of this world, to the animal strength  and spirits, to the men of practical power, whilst immersed in it, the  man of ideas appears out of his reason. They alone have reason.    Things always bring their own philosophy with them, that is, prudence.  No man acquires property without acquiring with it a little arithmetic,  also. In England, the richest country that ever existed, property  stands for more, compared with personal ability, than in any other.  After dinner, a man believes less, denies more; verities have lost  some charm. After dinner, arithmetic is the only science; ideas are  disturbing, incendiary, follies of young men, repudiated by the solid  portion of society; and a man comes to be valued by his athletic and  animal qualities. Spence relates, that Mr. Pope was with Sir Godfrey  Kneller one day, when his nephew, a Guinea trader, came in. \"Nephew,\"  said Sir Godfrey, \"you have the honor of seeing the two greatest men  in the world.\" \"I don't know how great men you may be,\" said the Guinea  man, \"but I don't like your looks. I have often bought a man much  better than both of you, all muscles and bones, for ten guineas. Thus,  the men of the senses revenge themselves on the professors, and repay  scorn for scorn. The first had leaped to conclusions not yet ripe, and  say more than is true; the others make themselves merry with the  philosopher, and weigh man by the pound.--They believe that mustard  bites the tongue, that pepper is hot, friction-matches are incendiary,  revolvers to be avoided, and suspenders hold up pantaloons; that there  is much sentiment in a chest of tea; and a man will be eloquent, if  you give him good wine. Are you tender and scrupulous,--you must eat  more mince-pie. They hold that Luther had milk in him when he said,    \"Wer nicht liebt Wein, Weib, und Gesang Der bleibt ein Narr sein Leben  lang,\"    and when he advised a young scholar perplexed with fore-ordination and  free-will, to get well drunk. \"The nerves,\" says Cabanis, \"they are  the man.\" My neighbor, a jolly farmer, in the tavern bar-room, thinks  that the use of money is sure and speedy spending. \"For his part,\" he  says, \"he puts his down his neck, and gets the good of it.\"    The inconvenience of this way of thinking is, that it runs into  indifferentism, and then into disgust. Life is eating us up. We shall  be fables presently. Keep cool: it will be all one a hundred years  hence. Life's well enough; but we shall be glad to get out of it, and  they will all be glad to have us. Why should we fret and drudge? Our  meat will taste to-morrow as it did yesterday, and we may at last have  had enough of it. \"Ah,\" said my languid gentleman at Oxford, \"there's  nothing new or true,--and no matter.\"    With a little more bitterness, the cynic moans: our life is like an  ass led to market by a bundle of hay being carried before him: he sees  nothing but the bundle of hay. \"There is so much trouble in coming  into the world,\" said Lord Bolingbroke, \"and so much more, as well as  meanness, in going out of it, that 'tis hardly worth while to be here  at all.\" I knew a philosopher of this kidney, who was accustomed briefly  to sum up his experience of human nature in saying, \"Mankind is a  damned rascal:\" and the natural corollary is pretty sure to  follow,--\"The world lives by humbug, and so will I.\"    The abstractionist and the materialist thus mutually exasperating each  other, and the scoffer expressing the worst of materialism, there  arises a third party to occupy the middle ground between these two,  the skeptic, namely. He finds both wrong by being in extremes. He  labors to plant his feet, to be the beam of the balance. He will not  go beyond his card. He sees the one-sidedness of these men of the  street; he will not be a Gibeonite; he stands for the intellectual  faculties, a cool head, and whatever serves to keep it cool; no  unadvised industry, no unrewarded self-devotion, no loss of the brains  in toil. Am I an ox, or a dray?--You are both in extremes, he says.  You that will have all solid, and a world of pig-lead, deceive  yourselves grossly. You believe yourselves rooted and grounded on  adamant; and, yet, if we uncover the last facts of our knowledge, you  are spinning like bubbles in a river, you know not whither or whence,  and you are bottomed and capped and wrapped in delusions.    Neither will he be betrayed to a book, and wrapped in a gown. The  studious class are their own victims; they are thin and pale, their  feet are cold, their heads are hot, the night is without sleep, the  day a fear of interruption,--pallor, squalor, hunger, and egotism. If  you come near them, and see what conceits they entertain,--they are  abstractionists, and spend their days and nights in dreaming some  dreams; in expecting the homage of society to some precious scheme  built on a truth, but destitute of proportion in its presentment, of  justness in its application, and of all energy of will in the schemer  to embody and vitalize it.    But I see plainly, he says, that I cannot see. I know that human  strength is not in extremes, but in avoiding extremes. I, at least,  will shun the weakness of philosophizing beyond my depth. What is the  use of pretending to powers we have not? What is the use of pretending  to assurances we have not, respecting the other life? Why exaggerate  the power of virtue? Why be an angel before your time?

The air of depression was about the place, and I hurried  back to the sloop to forget myself again in the voyage.    Early the next morning I stood out from Borgia Bay, and off Cape Quod,  where the wind fell light, I moored the sloop by kelp in twenty  fathoms of water, and held her there a few hours against a three-knot  current. That night I anchored in Langara Cove, a few miles farther  along, where on the following day I discovered wreckage and goods  washed up from the sea. I worked all day now, salving and boating off  a cargo to the sloop. The bulk of the goods was tallow in casks and in  lumps from which the casks had broken away; and embedded in the  seaweed was a barrel of wine, which I also towed alongside. I hoisted  them all in with the throat-halyards, which I took to the windlass.  The weight of some of the casks was a little over eight hundred  pounds.    [Illustration: Salving wreckage.]    There were no Indians about Langara; evidently there had not been any  since the great gale which had washed the wreckage on shore. Probably  it was the same gale that drove the _Spray_ off Cape Horn, from March  3 to 8. Hundreds of tons of kelp had been torn from beds in deep water  and rolled up into ridges on the beach. A specimen stalk which I found  entire, roots, leaves, and all, measured one hundred and thirty-one  feet in length. At this place I filled a barrel of water at night, and  on the following day sailed with a fair wind at last.    I had not sailed far, however, when I came abreast of more tallow in a  small cove, where I anchored, and boated off as before. It rained and  snowed hard all that day, and it was no light work carrying tallow in  my arms over the boulders on the beach. But I worked on till the  _Spray_ was loaded with a full cargo. I was happy then in the prospect  of doing a good business farther along on the voyage, for the habits  of an old trader would come to the surface. I sailed from the cove  about noon, greased from top to toe, while my vessel was tallowed from  keelson to truck. My cabin, as well as the hold and deck, was stowed  full of tallow, and all were thoroughly smeared.          CHAPTER X      Running to Port Angosto in a snow-storm--A defective sheetrope places  the _Spray_ in peril--The _Spray_ as a target for a Fuegian arrow--The  island of Alan Erric--Again in the open Pacific--The run to the island  of Juan Fernandez--An absentee king--At Robinson Crusoe's anchorage.    Another gale had then sprung up, but the wind was still fair, and I  had only twenty-six miles to run for Port Angosto, a dreary enough  place, where, however, I would find a safe harbor in which to refit  and stow cargo. I carried on sail to make the harbor before dark, and  she fairly flew along, all covered with snow, which fell thick and  fast, till she looked like a white winter bird. Between the  storm-bursts I saw the headland of my port, and was steering for it  when a flaw of wind caught the mainsail by the lee, jibed it over, and  dear! dear! how nearly was this the cause of disaster; for the sheet  parted and the boom unshipped, and it was then close upon night. I  worked till the perspiration poured from my body to get things  adjusted and in working order before dark, and, above all, to get it  done before the sloop drove to leeward of the port of refuge. Even  then I did not get the boom shipped in its saddle. I was at the  entrance of the harbor before I could get this done, and it was time  to haul her to or lose the port; but in that condition, like a bird  with a broken wing, she made the haven. The accident which so  jeopardized my vessel and cargo came of a defective sheet-rope, one  made from sisal, a treacherous fiber which has caused a deal of strong  language among sailors.    I did not run the _Spray_ into the inner harbor of Port Angosto, but  came to inside a bed of kelp under a steep bluff on the port hand  going in. It was an exceedingly snug nook, and to make doubly sure of  holding on here against all williwaws I moored her with two anchors  and secured her besides, by cables to trees. However, no wind ever  reached there except back flaws from the mountains on the opposite  side of the harbor. There, as elsewhere in that region, the country  was made up of mountains. This was the place where I was to refit and  whence I was to sail direct, once more, for Cape Pillar and the  Pacific.    I remained at Port Angosto some days, busily employed about the sloop.  I stowed the tallow from the deck to the hold, arranged my cabin in  better order, and took in a good supply of wood and water. I also  mended the sloop's sails and rigging, and fitted a jigger, which  changed the rig to a yawl, though I called the boat a sloop just the  same, the jigger being merely a temporary affair.    I never forgot, even at the busiest time of my work there, to have my  rifle by me ready for instant use; for I was of necessity within range  of savages, and I had seen Fuegian canoes at this place when I  anchored in the port, farther down the reach, on the first trip  through the strait. I think it was on the second day, while I was  busily employed about decks, that I heard the swish of something  through the air close by my ear, and heard a \"zip\"-like sound in the  water, but saw nothing. Presently, however, I suspected that it was an  arrow of some sort, for just then one passing not far from me struck  the mainmast, where it stuck fast, vibrating from the shock--a Fuegian  autograph. A savage was somewhere near, there could be no doubt about  that. I did not know but he might be shooting at me, with a view to  getting my sloop and her cargo; and so I threw up my old  Martini-Henry, the rifle that kept on shooting, and the first shot  uncovered three Fuegians, who scampered from a clump of bushes where  they had been concealed, and made over the hills. I fired away a good  many cartridges, aiming under their feet to encourage their climbing.  My dear old gun woke up the hills, and at every report all three of  the savages jumped as if shot; but they kept on, and put Fuego real  estate between themselves and the _Spray_ as fast as their legs could  carry them. I took care then, more than ever before, that all my  firearms should be in order and that a supply of ammunition should  always be ready at hand. But the savages did not return, and although  I put tacks on deck every night, I never discovered that any more  visitors came, and I had only to sweep the deck of tacks carefully  every morning after.    [Illustration: \"The first shot uncovered three Fuegians.\"]    As the days went by, the season became more favorable for a chance to  clear the strait with a fair wind, and so I made up my mind after six  attempts, being driven back each, time, to be in no further haste to  sail. The bad weather on my last return to Port Angosto for shelter  brought the Chilean gunboat _Condor_ and the Argentine cruiser  _Azopardo_ into port. As soon as the latter came to anchor, Captain  Mascarella, the commander, sent a boat to the _Spray_ with the message  that he would take me in tow for Sandy Point if I would give up the  voyage and return--the thing farthest from my mind. The officers of  the _Azopardo_ told me that, coming up the strait after the _Spray_ on  her first passage through, they saw Black Pedro and learned that he  had visited me. The _Azopardo_, being a foreign man-of-war, had no  right to arrest the Fuegian outlaw, but her captain blamed me for not  shooting the rascal when he came to my sloop.    I procured some cordage and other small supplies from these vessels,  and the officers of each of them mustered a supply of warm flannels,  of which I was most in need. With these additions to my outfit, and  with the vessel in good trim, though somewhat deeply laden, I was well  prepared for another bout with the Southern, misnamed Pacific, Ocean.    In the first week in April southeast winds, such as appear about Cape  Horn in the fall and winter seasons, bringing better weather than that  experienced in the summer, began to disturb the upper clouds; a little  more patience, and the time would come for sailing with a fair wind.    At Port Angosto I met Professor Dusen of the Swedish scientific  expedition to South America and the Pacific Islands. The professor was  camped by the side of a brook at the head of the harbor, where there  were many varieties of moss, in which he was interested, and where the  water was, as his Argentine cook said, \"muy rico.\" The professor had  three well-armed Argentines along in his camp to fight savages. They  seemed disgusted when I filled water at a small stream near the  vessel, slighting their advice to go farther up to the greater brook,  where it was \"muy rico.\" But they were all fine fellows, though it was  a wonder that they did not all die of rheumatic pains from living on  wet ground.    Of all the little haps and mishaps to the _Spray_ at Port Angosto, of  the many attempts to put to sea, and of each return for shelter, it is  not my purpose to speak. Of hindrances there were many to keep her  back, but on the thirteenth day of April, and for the seventh and last  time, she weighed anchor from that port. Difficulties, however,  multiplied all about in so strange a manner that had I been given to  superstitious fears I should not have persisted in sailing on a  thirteenth day, notwithstanding that a fair wind blew in the offing.  Many of the incidents were ludicrous. When I found myself, for  instance, disentangling the sloop's mast from the branches of a tree  after she had drifted three times around a small island, against my  will, it seemed more than one's nerves could bear, and I had to speak  about it, so I thought, or die of lockjaw, and I apostrophized the  _Spray_ as an impatient farmer might his horse or his ox. \"Didn't you  know,\" cried I--\"didn't you know that you couldn't"]]]
