If you are watched as closely as  it would seem, you may be robbed before you can hand this letter over to  the general. There is nothing at which these men will hesitate in order  to carry out their instructions. You might be arrested in the streets  by two or three men disguised as policemen, and carried away and  confined in some lonely place; you might be accused of a theft and given  in charge on some trumped-up accusation, in order that your luggage and  every article belonging to you might be thoroughly searched, before you  could prove your entire innocence. I can quite understand that, when you  first started, the object was simply to search for any papers you might  be carrying, and if this could be done without violence it would be so  effected, although, if murder was necessary, they would not have  hesitated at it; and even now, guessing as they will that you have come  here, directly you have landed, to obtain some important document, they  would, if they could find an opportunity, do anything to obtain it,  before you can deliver it to Garibaldi.\"    \"I quite feel that, signora, and have three young Garibaldian officers  waiting in a carriage below for me, and they will drive with me to the  Villa Spinola.\"    \"That will make you perfectly safe,\" and she then rose from her seat,  opened a secret drawer in an antique cabinet, and handed him the letter.  \"Now, Signor Percival,\" she said, \"this has been a visit of business,  but I hope that when you have this charge off your mind you will, as the  grandson of my old friend Signora Forli, come often to see me while you  are here. I am always at home in the evening, and it will be a great  pleasure to me to hear more of her than she tells me in her letters.\"    Thanking the countess for her invitation, and saying that he should  certainly avail himself of it, he went down and again took his place in  the carriage.    \"Have you found all as you wished?\" Sarto asked.    \"Yes; I have the letter in my pocket.\"    \"That is good news. Knowing what these secret agents are able to  accomplish, I did not feel at all sure that they might not in some way  have learned how the money was to be sent, and have managed to intercept  the letter.\"    Having given instructions to the driver where to go, they chatted as  they drove along of the proposed expedition.    \"None of us know yet,\" Rubini said, \"whether it is against the Papal  States or Naples. We all received the telegram we had for some time been  hoping for, with the simple word 'Come.' However, it matters not a bit  to us whether we first free the Pope's dominions or Francisco's.\"    \"Will you go in with me to see Garibaldi?\"    \"No; we have already received orders that, until we are called upon, it  is best that we should remain quietly with our families. Were a large  number of persons to pay visits to him, the authorities would know that  the time was close at hand when he intended to start on an expedition of  some kind. The mere fact that we have come here to stay for a time with  our friends is natural enough; but we may be sure that everything that  passes at the villa is closely watched. It is known, I have no doubt,  that an expedition is intended, and Cavour may wait to prevent it from  starting, until the last moment; therefore I should say that it is  important that no one should know on what date Garibaldi intends to sail  until the hour actually arrives. How we are to get ships to carry us,  how many are going, and how we are to obtain arms, are matters that  don't concern us. We are quite content to wait until word comes to us,  'Be at such a place, at such an hour.'\"    \"I would give something to know which among the men we are passing are  those who have been on your track,\" Sarto remarked. \"It would be such a  satisfaction to laugh in their faces and to shout, 'Have you had a  pleasant journey?' or, 'We congratulate you,' or something of that  sort.\"    \"They feel sore enough without that,\" Maffio said. \"They are  unscrupulous villains; but to do them justice, they are shrewd ones, and  work their hardest for their employers, and it is not very often that  they fail; and you have a right to congratulate yourself that for once  they have been foiled. It is certainly a feather in your cap, Percival,  that you and your friends have succeeded in outwitting them.\"    They had now left the city and were driving along the coast road towards  the Villa Spinola. There were only a few people on the road.    \"You see, it is well that we came in force,\" Sarto remarked; \"for had  you been alone, the carriage might very well have been stopped, and  yourself seized and carried off, without there being any one to notice  the affair. I have no doubt that even now there is a party somewhere  behind a wall or a hedge, in waiting for you; they would probably be  sent here as soon as you landed, and would not be recalled, as, until  you left the house of the countess, all hope that you would drive along  this road alone would not be at an end.\"    \"We shall call and see you this evening, and we all hope that you will  use our homes as your own while you are staying here,\" Rubini said. \"We  can introduce you to numbers of our friends, all of our way of thinking,  and will do our best to make your stay at Genoa as pleasant as possible.  It may be some time before all is ready for a start, and until that is  the case you will have nothing to do, and certainly Garibaldi will not  want visitors.\"    \"I shall be pleased indeed to avail myself of your kindness,\" Frank  said. \"It will be a great pleasure to me to see something of Italian  society, and I should find time hang very heavy on my hands at the  hotel, where there are, I know, very few visitors staying at present.\"    \"That is the villa,\" Rubini said, pointing to a large house surrounded  by a high wall.    \"Will you take my vehicle back?\"    \"No; we shall walk. I should advise you to keep the carriage, however  long you may stay here. These fellows will be very sore at finding they  have failed, after all the trouble they have taken in the matter. I  don't say that they will be watching for you; but if they should come  across you in a lonely spot, I think it is very probable that they would  not hesitate to get even with you with the stab of a knife between your  shoulders.\"    Alighting, Frank rang at the bell. His friends stood chatting with him  until a man, after looking through a grill in the gate, came out; and  then, feeling that their mission was safely accomplished, they started  for their walk back in high spirits.    \"I do not know whether the general is in at present, signor,\" the man  said, as Frank was about to enter. \"May I ask your business?\"    \"If you will take this card to him, I am sure that he will see me.\"    In three minutes the gates were opened. Frank entered on foot, and would  have left the carriage outside; but the porter said,--    \"It had better come in, signor; carriages standing at a gate attract  attention.\"    Garibaldi was seated in a room with two men, who were, as Frank  afterwards learned, Bixio and Crispi. Garibaldi had risen from his seat  and was looking inquiringly at the door as the lad entered.    \"Welcome, Signor Percival! You have come, doubtless, on the part of my  dear friend your father. Has he not come with you? I trust that he is  but delayed.\"    \"I come on the part of my mother, general,\" Frank replied. \"I lost my  father more than a year ago.\"    \"And I had not heard of it!\" the general exclaimed. \"Alas! alas! for my  friend and comrade; this is indeed a heavy blow to me. I looked forward  so much to seeing him. Oh, how many friends have I lost in the past two  years! And so your mother has sent you to me?\"    \"She bade me give you this letter, general.\"    The letter was not a long one. Mrs. Percival briefly told how her  husband had set out to endeavour to find where Professor Forli was  imprisoned, how he had been attacked and killed by brigands, and how  she, knowing what her husband's wishes would have been, had sent her  son. \"He is young,\" she said, \"but not so young as many of those who  have fought under you. He is as eager and enthusiastic in the cause of  Italian liberty as was his father, having, as you may well suppose,  learned the tale from my husband and myself, and my father and mother.  As you will see, he speaks Italian as well as English, and I pray you,  for the sake of my husband, to take him on your staff; or, if that  cannot be, he will shoulder a musket and march with you. He does not  come empty-handed. My husband has for years laid by a certain amount to  be used in the good cause when the time came. He will tell you where it  is to be obtained, and how. I wish you success with all my heart, and  if the prayers of two widowed women will avail aught, you will have  them daily. It is my only son I give you, and a widow cannot give more.  The money is from my husband; the boy is from me.\"    Garibaldi's eyes filled with tears as he read the letter.    \"Your mother is a noble woman indeed! How could she be otherwise, as the  daughter of Forli and the wife of my brave comrade? Surely you will be  most welcome to me, young man--welcome if you came only as your mother's  gift to Italy.\"    Frank opened the envelope, which was directed to himself, and took out  five slips of thin paper.    \"These are bills, general,\" he said, handing them to him. \"They are  drawn upon a bank at Genoa, and are each for two thousand pounds.\"    \"Francs, you must mean, surely?\" Garibaldi said.    \"No, general; they are English pounds.\"    Exclamations of surprise and gratification broke from Garibaldi and his  two companions.    \"This is a royal gift!\" the former cried. \"My brave comrade is not here  to help us; but he has sent us a wonderful proof of his love for the  cause. It is noble!--it is superb! This "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#18)"],[1,"subject of his malady, for he  was in a very excited state.    The reader will be able to gather from the above conversation what my  design really was. I was determined to escape, and to escape under the  character of Lieutenant Fakenham; taking it from him to his face, as  it were, and making use of it to meet my imperious necessity. It  was forgery and robbery, if you like; for I took all his money and  clothes,--I don't care to conceal it; but the need was so urgent, that  I would do so again: and I knew I could not effect my escape without his  purse, as well as his name. Hence it became my duty to take possession  of one and the other.    As the lieutenant lay still in bed upstairs, I did not hesitate at  all about assuming his uniform, especially after taking care to inform  myself from the doctor whether any men of ours who might know me were in  the town. But there were none that I could hear of; and so I calmly took  my walks with Madame Lischen, dressed in the lieutenant's uniform, made  inquiries as to a horse that I wanted to purchase, reported myself to  the commandant of the place as Lieutenant Fakenham, of Gale's English  regiment of foot, convalescent, and was asked to dine with the officers  of the Prussian regiment at a very sorry mess they had. How Fakenham  would have stormed and raged, had he known the use I was making of his  name!    Whenever that worthy used to inquire about his clothes, which he did  with many oaths and curses that he would have me caned at the regiment  for inattention, I, with a most respectful air, informed him that they  were put away in perfect safety below; and, in fact, had them very  neatly packed, and ready for the day when I proposed to depart. His  papers and money, however, he kept under his pillow; and, as I had  purchased a horse, it became necessary to pay for it.    At a certain hour, then, I ordered the animal to be brought round, when  I would pay the dealer for him. (I shall pass over my adieux with my  kind hostess, which were very tearful indeed). And then, making up my  mind to the great action, walked upstairs to Fakenham's room attired in  his full regimentals, and with his hat cocked over my left eye.    'You gWeat scoundWel!' said he, with a multiplicity of oaths; 'you  mutinous dog! what do you mean by dWessing yourself in my Wegimentals?  As sure as my name's Fakenham, when we get back to the Wegiment, I'll  have your soul cut out of your body.'    'I'm promoted, Lieutenant,' said I, with a sneer. 'I'm come to take my  leave of you;' and then going up to his bed, I said, 'I intend to have  your papers and purse.' With this I put my hand under his pillow; at  which he gave a scream that might have called the whole garrison about  my ears. 'Hark ye, sir!' said I, 'no more noise, or you are a dead  man!' and taking a handkerchief, I bound it tight around his mouth so  as well-nigh to throttle him, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his  shirt, tied them in a knot together, and so left him; removing the  papers and the purse, you may be sure, and wishing him politely a good  day.    'It is the mad corporal,' said I to the people down below who were  attracted by the noise from the sick man's chamber; and so taking leave  of the old blind Jagdmeister, and an adieu (I will not say how tender)  of his daughter, I mounted my newly purchased animal; and, as I pranced  away, and the sentinels presented arms to me at the town-gates, felt  once more that I was in my proper sphere, and determined never again to  fall from the rank of a gentleman.    I took at first the way towards Bremen, where our army was, and gave out  that I was bringing reports and letters from the Prussian commandant  of Warburg to headquarters; but, as soon as I got out of sight of the  advanced sentinels, I turned bridle and rode into the Hesse-Cassel  territory, which is luckily not very far from Warburg: and I promise you  I was very glad to see the blue-and-red stripes on the barriers, which  showed me that I was out of the land occupied by our countrymen. I rode  to Hof, and the next day to Cassel, giving out that I was the bearer of  despatches to Prince Henry, then on the Lower Rhine, and put up at the  best hotel of the place, where the field-officers of the garrison had  their ordinary. These gentlemen I treated to the best wines that the  house afforded, for I was determined to keep up the character of the  English gentleman, and I talked to them about my English estates with a  fluency that almost made me believe in the stories which I invented. I  was even asked to an assembly at Wilhelmshohe, the Elector's palace, and  danced a minuet there with the Hofmarshal's lovely daughter, and lost a  few pieces to his excellency the first huntmaster of his Highness.    At our table at the inn there was a Prussian officer who treated me with  great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England; which  I answered as best I might. But this best, I am bound to say, was bad  enough. I knew nothing about England, and the Court, and the noble  families there; but, led away by the vaingloriousness of youth (and a  propensity which I possessed in my early days, but of which I have long  since corrected myself, to boast and talk in a manner not altogether  consonant with truth), I invented a thousand stories which I told him;  described the King and the Ministers to him, said the British Ambassador  at Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of  recommendation to him. When the officer asked me my uncle's name, I was  not able to give him the real name, and so said his name was O'Grady: it  is as good a name as any other, and those of Kilballyowen, county  Cork, are as good a family as any in the world, as I have heard. As for  stories about my regiment, of these, of course, I had no lack. I wish my  other histories had been equally authentic.    On the morning I left Cassel, my Prussian friend came to me with an open  smiling countenance, and said he, too, was bound for Dusseldorf, whither  I said my route lay; and so laying our horses' heads together we jogged  on. The country was desolate beyond description. The prince in whose  dominions we were was known to be the most ruthless seller of men in  Germany. He would sell to any bidder, and during the five years which  the war (afterwards called the Seven Years' War) had now lasted, had  so exhausted the males of his principality, that the fields remained  untilled: even the children of twelve years old were driven off to the  war, and I saw herds of these wretches marching forwards, attended by  a few troopers, now under the guidance of a red-coated Hanovarian  sergeant, now with a Prussian sub-officer accompanying them; with some  of whom my companion exchanged signs of recognition.    'It hurts my feelings,' said he, 'to be obliged to commune with such  wretches; but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and  hence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh. They get  five-and-twenty dollars from our Government for every man they bring  in. For fine men--for men like you,' he added, laughing, 'we would go as  high as a hundred. In the old King's time we would have given a thousand  for you, when he had his giant regiment that our present monarch  disbanded.'    'I knew one of them,' said I, 'who served with you: we used to call him  Morgan Prussia.'    'Indeed; and who was this Morgan Prussia?'    'Why, a huge grenadier of ours, who was somehow snapped up in Hanover by  some of your recruiters.'    'The rascals!' said my friend: 'and did they dare take an Englishman?'    ''Faith this was an Irishman, and a great deal too sharp for them;  as you shall hear. Morgan was taken, then, and drafted into the giant  guard, and was the biggest man almost among all the giants there. Many  of these monsters used to complain of their life, and their caning, and  their long drills, and their small pay; but Morgan was not one of the  grumblers. \"It's a deal better,\" said he, \"to get fat here in Berlin,  than to starve in rags in Tipperary!\"'    'Where is Tipperary?' asked my companion.    'That is exactly what Morgan's friends asked him. It is a beautiful  district in Ireland, the capital of which is the magnificent city of  Clonmel: a city, let me tell you, sir, only inferior to Dublin and  London, and far more sumptuous than any on the Continent. Well, Morgan  said that his birthplace was near that city, and the only thing which  caused him unhappiness, in his present situation, was the thought that  his brothers were still starving at home, when they might be so much  better off in His Majesty's service.    '\"'Faith,\" says Morgan to the sergeant, to whom he imparted the  information, \"it's my brother Bin that would make the fine sergeant of  the guards, entirely!\"    '\"Is Ben as tall as you are?\" asked the sergeant.    '\"As tall as ME, is it? Why, man, I'm the shortest of my family! There's  six more of us, but Bin's the biggest of all. Oh! out and out the  biggest. Seven feet in his stockin-FUT, as sure as my name's Morgan!\"    '\"Can't we send and fetch them over, these brothers of yours?\"    '\"Not you. Ever since I was seduced by one of you gentlemen of the cane,  they've a mortal aversion to all sergeants,\" answered Morgan: \"but  it's a pity they cannot come, too. What a monster Bin would be in a  grenadier's cap!\"    'He said nothing more at the time regarding his brothers, but only  sighed as if lamenting their hard fate. However, the story was told by  the sergeant to the officers, and by the officers to the King himself;  and His Majesty was so inflamed by curiosity, that he actually consented  to let Morgan go home in order to bring back with him his seven enormous  brothers.'    'And were they as big as Morgan pretended?' asked my comrade. I could  not help laughing at his simplicity.    'Do you suppose,' cried I, 'that Morgan ever came back? No, no; once  free, he was too"]]]
