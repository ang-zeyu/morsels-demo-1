I remember that I spoke very slowly as I asked him  the question:    \"Whose is the lighted window, Harley?\"    \"Has Colonel Menendez taken you into a little snuggery or smoke-room  which faces his bedroom in the southeast corner of the house?\"    \"No, but Miss Beverley has mentioned the room.\"    \"Ah. Well, there is a light in that room, Knox.\"    \"Possibly the Colonel has not retired?\"    \"According to Madame de Staemer he went to bed several hours ago, you may  remember.\"    \"True,\" I murmured, fumbling for the significance of his words.    \"The next point is this,\" he resumed. \"You saw Madame retire to her own  room, which, as you know, is on the ground floor, and I have satisfied  myself that the door communicating with the servants' wing is locked.\"    \"I see. But to what is all this leading, Harley?\"    \"To a very curious fact, and the fact is this: The Colonel is not  alone.\"    I sat bolt upright.    \"What?\" I cried.    \"Not so loud,\" warned Harley.    \"But, Harley--\"    \"My dear fellow, we must face facts. I repeat, the Colonel is not  alone.\"    \"Why do you say so?\"    \"Twice I have seen a shadow on the blind of the smoke-room.\"    \"His own shadow, probably.\"    Again Paul Harley's cigarette glowed in the darkness.    \"I am prepared to swear,\" he replied, \"that it was the shadow of a  woman.\"    \"Harley----\"    \"Don't get excited, Knox. I am dealing with the strangest case of my  career, and I am jumping to no conclusions. But just let us look at  the circumstances judicially. The whole of the domestic staff we may  dismiss, with the one exception of Mrs. Fisher, who, so far as I can  make out, occupies the position of a sort of working housekeeper, and  whose rooms are in the corner of the west wing immediately facing the  kitchen garden. Possibly you have not met Mrs. Fisher, Knox, but I have  made it my business to interview the whole of the staff and I may  say that Mrs. Fisher is a short, stout old lady, a native of Kent, I  believe, whose outline in no way corresponds to that which I saw upon  the blind. Therefore, unless the door which communicates with the  servants' quarters was unlocked again to-night--to what are we reduced  in seeking to explain the presence of a woman in Colonel Menendez's  room? Madame de Staemer, unassisted, could not possibly have mounted the  stairs.\"    \"Stop, Harley!\" I said, sternly. \"Stop.\"    He ceased speaking, and I watched the steady glow of his cigarette in  the darkness. It lighted up his bronzed face and showed me the steely  gleam of his eyes.    \"You are counting too much on the locking of the door by Pedro,\" I  continued, speaking very deliberately. \"He is a man I would trust no  farther than I could see him, and if there is anything dark underlying  this matter you depend that he is involved in it. But the most natural  explanation, and also the most simple, is this--Colonel Menendez has  been taken seriously ill, and someone is in his room in the capacity of  a nurse.\"    \"Her behaviour was scarcely that of a nurse in a sick-room,\" murmured  Harley.    \"For God's sake tell me the truth,\" I said. \"Tell me all you saw.\"    \"I am quite prepared to do so, Knox. On three occasions, then, I saw  the figure of a woman, who wore some kind of loose robe, quite clearly  silhouetted upon the linen blind. Her gestures strongly resembled those  of despair.\"    \"Of despair?\"    \"Exactly. I gathered that she was addressing someone, presumably Colonel  Menendez, and I derived a strong impression that she was in a condition  of abject despair.\"    \"Harley,\" I said, \"on your word of honour did you recognize anything  in the movements, or in the outline of the figure, by which you could  identify the woman?\"    \"I did not,\" he replied, shortly. \"It was a woman who wore some kind  of loose robe, possibly a kimono. Beyond that I could swear to nothing,  except that it was not Mrs. Fisher.\"    We fell silent for a while. What Paul Harley's thoughts may have been  I know not, but my own were strange and troubled. Presently I found my  voice again, and:    \"I think, Harley,\" I said, \"that I should report to you something which  Miss Beverley told me this evening.\"    \"Yes?\" said he, eagerly. \"I am anxious to hear anything which may be of  the slightest assistance. You are no doubt wondering why I retired so  abruptly to-night. My reason was this: I could see that you were full of  some story which you had learned from Miss Beverley, and I was anxious  to perform my tour of inspection with a perfectly unprejudiced mind.\"    \"You mean that your suspicions rested upon an inmate of Cray's Folly?\"    \"Not upon any particular inmate, but I had early perceived a distinct  possibility that these manifestations of which the Colonel complained  might be due to the agency of someone inside the house. That this  person might be no more than an accomplice of the prime mover I also  recognized, of course. But what did you learn to-night, Knox?\"    I repeated Val Beverley's story of the mysterious footsteps and of the  cries which had twice awakened her in the night.    \"Hm,\" muttered Harley, when I had ceased speaking. \"Assuming her account  to be true----\"    \"Why should you doubt it?\" I interrupted, hotly.    \"My dear Knox, it is my business to doubt everything until I have  indisputable evidence of its truth. I say, assuming her story to be  true, we find ourselves face to face with the fantastic theory that some  woman unknown is living secretly in Cray's Folly.\"    \"Perhaps in one of the tower rooms,\" I suggested, eagerly. \"Why, Harley,  that would account for the Colonel's marked unwillingness to talk about  this part of the house.\"    My sight was now becoming used to the dusk, and I saw Harley vigorously  shake his head.    \"No, no,\" he replied; \"I have seen all the tower rooms. I can swear that  no one inhabits them. Besides, is it feasible?\"    \"Then whose were the footsteps that Miss Beverley heard?\"    \"Obviously those of the woman who, at this present moment, so far as I  know, is in the smoking-room with Colonel Menendez.\"    I sighed wearily.    \"This is a strange business, Harley. I begin to think that the mystery  is darker than I ever supposed.\"    We fell silent again. The weird cry of a night hawk came from somewhere  in the valley, but otherwise everything within and without the great  house seemed strangely still. This stillness presently imposed its  influence upon me, for when I spoke again, I spoke in a low voice.    \"Harley,\" I said, \"my imagination is playing me tricks. I thought I  heard the fluttering of wings at that moment.\"    \"Fortunately, my imagination remains under control,\" he replied, grimly;  \"therefore I am in a position to inform you that you did hear the  fluttering of wings. An owl has just flown into one of the trees  immediately outside the window.\"    \"Oh,\" said I, and uttered a sigh of relief.    \"It is extremely fortunate that my imagination is so carefully trained,\"  continued Harley; \"otherwise, when the woman whose shadow I saw upon the  blind to-night raised her arms in a peculiar fashion, I could not well  have failed to attach undue importance to the shape of the shadow thus  created.\"    \"What was the shape of the shadow, then?\"    \"Remarkably like that of a bat.\"    He spoke the words quietly, but in that still darkness, with dawn yet a  long way off, they possessed the power which belongs to certain chords  in music, and to certain lines in poetry. I was chilled unaccountably,  and I peopled the empty corridors of Cray's Folly with I know not  what uncanny creatures; nightmare fancies conjured up from memories of  haunted manors.    Such was my mood, then, when suddenly Paul Harley stood up. My eyes were  growing more and more used to the darkness, and from something strained  in his attitude I detected the fact that he was listening intently.    He placed his cigarette on the table beside the bed and quietly crossed  the room. I knew from his silent tread that he wore shoes with rubber  soles. Very quietly he turned the handle and opened the door.    \"What is it, Harley?\" I whispered.    Dimly I saw him raise his hand. Inch by inch he opened the door. My  nerves in a state of tension, I sat there watching him, when without  a sound he slipped out of the room and was gone. Thereupon I arose and  followed as far as the doorway.    Harley was standing immediately outside in the corridor. Seeing me, he  stepped back, and: \"Don't move, Knox,\" he said, speaking very close to  my ear. \"There is someone downstairs in the hall. Wait for me here.\"    With that he moved stealthily off, and I stood there, my heart beating  with unusual rapidity, listening--listening for a challenge, a cry, a  scuffle--I knew not what to expect.    Cavernous and dimly lighted, the corridor stretched away to my left.  On the right it branched sharply in the direction of the gallery  overlooking the hall.    The seconds passed, but no sound rewarded my alert listening--until,  very faintly, but echoing in a muffled, church-like fashion around that  peculiar building, came a slight, almost sibilant sound, which I took to  be the gentle closing of a distant door.    Whilst I was still wondering if I had really heard this sound or merely  imagined it:    \"Who goes there?\" came sharply in Harley's voice.    I heard a faint click, and knew that he had shone the light of an  electric torch down into the hall.    I hesitated no longer, but ran along to join him. As I came to the head  of the main staircase, however, I saw him crossing the hall below. He  was making in the direction of the door which shut off the servants'  quarters. Here he paused, and I saw him trying the handle. Evidently  the door was locked, for he turned and swept the white ray all about the  place. He tried several other doors, but found them all to be locked,  for presently he came upstairs again, smiling grimly when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#18)"],[1,"  It ended abruptly in a sheer wall thousands of feet high at the base of  which stretched a level valley, broken here and there by low rolling  hills and little clumps of forest, and with tiny rivers formed by the  melting of the ice barrier at its base.    Once we passed far above what seemed to be a deep canyon-like rift  stretching from the ice wall on the north across the valley as far as  the eye could reach.  \"That is the bed of the River Iss,\" said Xodar.  \"It runs far beneath the ice field, and below the level of the Valley  Otz, but its canyon is open here.\"    Presently I descried what I took to be a village, and pointing it out  to Xodar asked him what it might be.    \"It is a village of lost souls,\" he answered, laughing.  \"This strip  between the ice barrier and the mountains is considered neutral ground.  Some turn off from their voluntary pilgrimage down the Iss, and,  scaling the awful walls of its canyon below us, stop in the valley.  Also a slave now and then escapes from the therns and makes his way  hither.    \"They do not attempt to recapture such, since there is no escape from  this outer valley, and as a matter of fact they fear the patrolling  cruisers of the First Born too much to venture from their own domains.    \"The poor creatures of this outer valley are not molested by us since  they have nothing that we desire, nor are they numerically strong  enough to give us an interesting fight--so we too leave them alone.    \"There are several villages of them, but they have increased in numbers  but little in many years since they are always warring among  themselves.\"    Now we swung a little north of west, leaving the valley of lost souls,  and shortly I discerned over our starboard bow what appeared to be a  black mountain rising from the desolate waste of ice.  It was not high  and seemed to have a flat top.    Xodar had left us to attend to some duty on the vessel, and Phaidor and  I stood alone beside the rail.  The girl had not once spoken since we  had been brought to the deck.    \"Is what he has been telling me true?\" I asked her.    \"In part, yes,\" she answered.  \"That about the outer valley is true,  but what he says of the location of the Temple of Issus in the centre  of his country is false.  If it is not false--\" she hesitated.  \"Oh it  cannot be true, it cannot be true.  For if it were true then for  countless ages have my people gone to torture and ignominious death at  the hands of their cruel enemies, instead of to the beautiful Life  Eternal that we have been taught to believe Issus holds for us.\"    \"As the lesser Barsoomians of the outer world have been lured by you to  the terrible Valley Dor, so may it be that the therns themselves have  been lured by the First Born to an equally horrid fate,\" I suggested.  \"It would be a stern and awful retribution, Phaidor; but a just one.\"    \"I cannot believe it,\" she said.    \"We shall see,\" I answered, and then we fell silent again for we were  rapidly approaching the black mountains, which in some indefinable way  seemed linked with the answer to our problem.    As we neared the dark, truncated cone the vessel's speed was diminished  until we barely moved.  Then we topped the crest of the mountain and  below us I saw yawning the mouth of a huge circular well, the bottom of  which was lost in inky blackness.    The diameter of this enormous pit was fully a thousand feet.  The walls  were smooth and appeared to be composed of a black, basaltic rock.    For a moment the vessel hovered motionless directly above the centre of  the gaping void, then slowly she began to settle into the black chasm.  Lower and lower she sank until as darkness enveloped us her lights were  thrown on and in the dim halo of her own radiance the monster  battleship dropped on and on down into what seemed to me must be the  very bowels of Barsoom.    For quite half an hour we descended and then the shaft terminated  abruptly in the dome of a mighty subterranean world.  Below us rose and  fell the billows of a buried sea.  A phosphorescent radiance  illuminated the scene.  Thousands of ships dotted the bosom of the  ocean.  Little islands rose here and there to support the strange and  colourless vegetation of this strange world.    Slowly and with majestic grace the battleship dropped until she rested  on the water.  Her great propellers had been drawn and housed during  our descent of the shaft and in their place had been run out the  smaller but more powerful water propellers.  As these commenced to  revolve the ship took up its journey once more, riding the new element  as buoyantly and as safely as she had the air.    Phaidor and I were dumbfounded.  Neither had either heard or dreamed  that such a world existed beneath the surface of Barsoom.    Nearly all the vessels we saw were war craft.  There were a few  lighters and barges, but none of the great merchantmen such as ply the  upper air between the cities of the outer world.    \"Here is the harbour of the navy of the First Born,\" said a voice  behind us, and turning we saw Xodar watching us with an amused smile on  his lips.    \"This sea,\" he continued, \"is larger than Korus.  It receives the  waters of the lesser sea above it.  To keep it from filling above a  certain level we have four great pumping stations that force the  oversupply back into the reservoirs far north from which the red men  draw the water which irrigates their farm lands.\"    A new light burst on me with this explanation.  The red men had always  considered it a miracle that caused great columns of water to spurt  from the solid rock of their reservoir sides to increase the supply of  the precious liquid which is so scarce in the outer world of Mars.    Never had their learned men been able to fathom the secret of the  source of this enormous volume of water.  As ages passed they had  simply come to accept it as a matter of course and ceased to question  its origin.    We passed several islands on which were strangely shaped circular  buildings, apparently roofless, and pierced midway between the ground  and their tops with small, heavily barred windows.  They bore the  earmarks of prisons, which were further accentuated by the armed guards  who squatted on low benches without, or patrolled the short beach lines.    Few of these islets contained over an acre of ground, but presently we  sighted a much larger one directly ahead.  This proved to be our  destination, and the great ship was soon made fast against the steep  shore.    Xodar signalled us to follow him and with a half-dozen officers and men  we left the battleship and approached a large oval structure a couple  of hundred yards from the shore.    \"You shall soon see Issus,\" said Xodar to Phaidor.  \"The few prisoners  we take are presented to her.  Occasionally she selects slaves from  among them to replenish the ranks of her handmaidens.  None serves  Issus above a single year,\" and there was a grim smile on the black's  lips that lent a cruel and sinister meaning to his simple statement.    Phaidor, though loath to believe that Issus was allied to such as  these, had commenced to entertain doubts and fears.  She clung very  closely to me, no longer the proud daughter of the Master of Life and  Death upon Barsoom, but a young and frightened girl in the power of  relentless enemies.    The building which we now entered was entirely roofless.  In its centre  was a long tank of water, set below the level of the floor like the  swimming pool of a natatorium.  Near one side of the pool floated an  odd-looking black object.  Whether it were some strange monster of  these buried waters, or a queer raft, I could not at once perceive.    We were soon to know, however, for as we reached the edge of the pool  directly above the thing, Xodar cried out a few words in a strange  tongue.  Immediately a hatch cover was raised from the surface of the  object, and a black seaman sprang from the bowels of the strange craft.    Xodar addressed the seaman.    \"Transmit to your officer,\" he said, \"the commands of Dator Xodar.  Say  to him that Dator Xodar, with officers and men, escorting two  prisoners, would be transported to the gardens of Issus beside the  Golden Temple.\"    \"Blessed be the shell of thy first ancestor, most noble Dator,\" replied  the man.  \"It shall be done even as thou sayest,\" and raising both  hands, palms backward, above his head after the manner of salute which  is common to all races of Barsoom, he disappeared once more into the  entrails of his ship.    A moment later an officer resplendent in the gorgeous trappings of his  rank appeared on deck and welcomed Xodar to the vessel, and in the  latter's wake we filed aboard and below.    The cabin in which we found ourselves extended entirely across the  ship, having port-holes on either side below the water line.  No sooner  were all below than a number of commands were given, in accordance with  which the hatch was closed and secured, and the vessel commenced to  vibrate to the rhythmic purr of its machinery.    \"Where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water?\" asked Phaidor.    \"Not up,\" I replied, \"for I noticed particularly that while the  building is roofless it is covered with a strong metal grating.\"    \"Then where?\" she asked again.    \"From the appearance of the craft I judge we are going down,\" I replied.    Phaidor shuddered.  For such long ages have the waters of Barsoom's  seas been a thing of tradition only that even this daughter of the  therns, born as she had been within sight of Mars' only remaining sea,  had the same terror of deep water as is a common attribute of all  Martians.    Presently the sensation of sinking became very apparent.  We were going  down swiftly.  Now we could hear the water rushing past the port-holes,  and in the dim light that filtered through them to the water beyond the  swirling eddies were plainly visible.    Phaidor grasped my arm.    \"Save me!\" she whispered."]]]
