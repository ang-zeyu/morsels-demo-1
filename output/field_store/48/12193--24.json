They needed shelter but couldn't find it.  This time they all sat behind bushes with their tails turned to  the wind and sand.    For hours the sand didn't let up.  About ten o'clock that night  the wind shifted around to the west, a little while later, to the  north, and then to the northeast.  It still didn't slow up.  Each  time it changed directions, it stirred up more sand.    As the wind shifted, so did the rabbits.  They moved around their  respective bushes, keeping behind the bushes from the sand, and  with their tails still windward.    When the wind came out of the north, it became very cold and  began to snow.  The temperature got down below zero that night  and many rabbits froze to death and were buried under the snow.    For a week or two after that storm, we went hunting and shot dead  rabbits, not knowing they were already dead.  They were still  sitting under bushes and looking very much like live rabbits.  We  continued to shoot dead rabbits until they were all eaten by  coyotes and buzzards.    It was reported that one rancher near Lamesa lost 500 cows that  night from the cold and the snow.    On one side of our house snow drifted into a huge pile halfway up  our windows.  After it melted, the sand which blew in with the  snow was at least two feet deep.  That was the first time I can  remember when snow was so dirty we couldn't make snow ice cream.  However, there were many other times later on.    Here is another little rabbit story.  On one occasion when Frank  was home, he went rabbit hunting with the other four of us boys.  We hadn't had much luck until almost sundown.  By that time we  were still about four or five miles from home and we came to  another windmill and waterhole.  There was a lot of sagebrush  around the waterhole and jackrabbits began to hop up here and  there.  This place was so far from civilization the rabbits were  not much afraid of us.  They would hop off a way and stop and sit  up and look back at us.    We all spread out and took a swath about the width of a city  block and circled the waterhole one time--and killed more  jackrabbits than we could carry home.  We swung some of them over  our shoulders, tied some to our overall suspenders and carried  some in our hands.  It was a long way home and we were plenty  tired before we got there.    During our stay on the plains, tractors had not yet established  themselves on American farms, at least not in our part of the  country.  Men were still raising fine work horses and looking  forward to raising even bigger and better ones.  A neighbor named  Debnam bought the biggest horse I ever hope to see.  A big man  had to reach high to touch his nose, and few men could reach the  top of his shoulders.  He was one of the six largest stallions in  the United States and he cost the man $3,600.  By the time he was  three years old he weighed 2600 pounds, and his feet were about  as large as a cedar water bucket.    Now Papa needed at least four of those fine work horses but he  didn't have the money to buy them, and he couldn't get the money.  And farm tractors were almost unheard of before the late 1920s.  However, there was a company that made an attachment to go on a  Model T Ford car which was supposed to make a tractor out of the  car.  The manufacturers name for the \"thing\" was \"Pull-Ford.\"  Papa heard of a man who had such a contraption, so he went to  look at it.    Now, the fact that the man was not using the gadget should have  told Papa something.  Moreover, the fact that he was willing to  sell it at a bargain should have told Papa something more.  And  finally, when he went and looked at it and saw that it was  practically unused, that should have been the final message to  Papa.    But Papa wasn't listening good.  He was a man in trouble.  Dry  weather and sand colic had claimed some of his best work horses.  And he could buy this thing for a lot less than four horses would  cost.  Anyway he bought the attachment and made it fit on the  Reo.  I suppose he reasoned that a Reo owner had more sense than  a Ford owner, and even if it was not a success on the man's Ford,  he could make it do the job on a Reo.    Well, anyway he bought it and brought it home and a few days  later he had it all rigged on the old car and ready to go.  It  didn't prove to be the best tractor in the world, in fact, it  might compare with a modern tractor of today about like the  Wright Brothers' first flying machine would compare with a  superjet.    Anyhow it worked some.  It took one to drive the car and one to  ride the plow.  It didn't replace the horse in the field half as  well as the Reo car replaced the horse on the road.  Yet it  filled in somewhat when feed was scarce and horses were tired.  This monster didn't have to stop and rest, just stop to get water  and cool off.  As a tractor it wasn't so hot--it only got hot.    We didn't spend all of our time at hard work on the farm.  Come  Saturday afternoon, if we were pretty well caught up with our  farm work, we would spend an hour or two in Lamesa.    I remember one time we were in Lamesa, when I was eleven years  old.  I had spent all my money except a dime.  I wanted to buy a  pocketbook to put my money in.  There were four stores in town  that sold pocketbooks and I went to all of them but it was of no  use.  The cheapest one any of them had was ten cents.  Now, if I  spent my dime for one, I wouldn't have any money left to put in  it.  And if I didn't buy one, I was apt to lose my dime.  What  should I do?  That was a big decision for me to make.    I went back to each store time and again, hoping to find a five  cent pocketbook I had overlooked before.  But it just wasn't  there.  And I don't recall whether I bought a ten cent one or  kept my dime.    Now you may ask, \"If you can't remember whether or not you bought  the purse, how can you remember it was on a Saturday?\"  That's  easy.  Saturday was about the only day we went to town.  I was a  big boy before I learned that there were people in town on other  days of the week.  I hardly knew that stores opened except on  Saturday.    I remember another time in Lamesa when a kid about my size was  aggravating me.  Now, we kids were taught not to fight.  I grew  up not knowing how to fight, not wanting to fight and thinking  that boys who did fight were bad boys.  And here I was, faced  with the stark realization that I needed something I didn't  have--the ability to make a bully leave me alone.  I was about as  big as he was, but I was afraid he had the know-how to fight in a  way that could hurt a country boy like me.    I didn't want to fight the boy.  I only wanted him to go away and  leave me alone.  But he had other plans.  We went in and out  among the cars parked by the curb.  I was always in the lead, he  was after me.  Somehow I had hoped that I could lose him.  But he  kept coming back, pinching and hitting me a little harder each  time.  I really think my not fighting him encouraged him to get  tougher and rougher.    Then he got me out behind the cars, out near their back wheels,  and he was just about to really let me have it.  People on the  sidewalk couldn't see us.  It was just him and me.  I had to do  something--so I hit him and ran.  That proved to be the best  thing I could have done.  He came right after me.  I knew he  might hit me but he couldn't hit me in the face and bloody my  nose--I had my back to him.    I jumped up on the curb with the bully right on my heels.  The  first man I passed asked, \"Is that boy bothering you?\"  Before I  could answer him, the boy had turned and was going away.  He  didn't bother me any more.  He probably thought the stranger was  a friend of mine and that he had better leave me alone or else  the man would get him.    On another trip to Lamesa I went with Papa one day into the back  of a hardware store--back among the shelves of bolts and nuts and  things.  Way back there were stacks of silver dollars and half  dollars and other coins, lying there on a shelf where the store  was only half lighted.  Papa and the clerk were around behind  some other shelves.  They couldn't even see me.  It would have  been easy to slip some money into my pocket and walk away.  But I  didn't, and I have wondered a lot of times just why I didn't.    There was no question but that I knew it would be the wrong thing  to do.  Yet I don't believe the moral aspect kept me from taking  at least some of the money.  That is to say, I could have lived  with my conscience but I could not have lived with the  condemnation I would have gotten from my family, once they  learned about it.  And I knew that somehow they would learn about  it.  Then there would have been the \"dishonoring\" of thy father  and thy mother.    This would not have been a small thing, like talking back to  Frank in the cotton patch years ago.  That was an isolated case  of one boy doing wrong and receiving his punishment.  It was my  punishment alone, it hurt no one else in the family and it was  soon forgotten.  But taking any part of the money from the store  would have been altogether different.  There would have been no  way for me to take some of it, then take my punishment and not  hurt my folks.    Until the depression years of the 1930s, merchants never fooled  around with pennies.  If the wholesale cost of an item was four  cents, he would usually sell it for ten cents.  Then he could  sell the items at two for 15 cents and still make a good profit.    Well, Papa wanted to buy us kids some firecrackers but the war  was on and they had gone from five cents a package up to ten  cents a package.  With six kids at home, that would put quite a  strain on Papa's pocketbook.  So while he was figuring how many  to buy, my brother Joel began dickering with the clerk.    \"Two for 15 cents?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" came the reply.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#18)"],[1,"or bluff that opened out on a barren  desert, known to the Mexicans as Tierra Caliente, or the Hot Lands.    Now the command entered upon another soul-trying march. The route from  the crossing of the Colorado was over the northeast corner of Lower  California, some sixty miles above the Gulf of California, then into  the south-eastern part of Upper California. The stronger men, with a  little extra ration, preceded the main army, to dig wells in the desert.    No sooner was the almost hopeless march commenced than men began to  lag behind, so that when the advance guard came to a halt at any part  of the journey, others were miles behind. The first day we came to a  well that General Phil. Kearney and his men had dug, but it had caved  in so badly that it was almost as much work to clean it as to dig a new  one; and when it was cleaned, our men dug another. The water was scant  and brackish. We remained at that point only until the rear of the  command caught up, then proceeded on our way, stopping but a short time  in any one place, until we reached Cariza, a splendid spring near the  base of the Sierra Nevada range of mountains. The first men to reach  water filled kegs and canteens, lashed them to the stouter animals, and  hastened back to succor and revive the famishing men who were bringing  up the rear.    On that terrible march many of the weaker men despaired of ever  reaching water. We passed several, who, with sunken and glazed eyes and  blackened mouths and looking as ghastly as death, stammered to us as  we passed them: \"Goodby, I shall never live to reach water. I cannot  go a step farther, but shall die on this spot.\" Poor fellows! I verily  believe that if they had not been resuscitated by the water that was  carried back, their words would have been painfully true before the  rising of another sun.    If it had not been for some fresh mules and beef cattle that we met on  this tedious march, we never could have got through with the wagons,  and possibly would have lost some men, as our flour had given out and  we were reduced so near to starvation as to eat every particle of the  worn-out beef ox; even the tender part of the horns and hoofs, and the  intestines, were broiled on the coals and eaten, without water to wash  them.    In our mess, the last spoonful of flour was made into a thin gravy by  stirring it into some water where some of our glue-like beef had been  boiled. This so-called gravy was divided among the men by spoonfuls,  then the pan was scraped with a table knife and wiped into a spoon,  and with the point of the same knife it was divided into seven parts.  Each man watched the division; and I do not believe there was one man  out of the seven but would have fought for his share of that spoonful  of pan-scrapings. Nor do I believe there was one of them who would  have robbed his comrades. For the last three or four hundred miles we  had been in the habit of cooking the food, and dividing it into seven  equal parts. Then one man would turn his back, and the cook or the one  who made the division would touch each morsel and say, \"Who shall have  that?\" whereupon the one whose back was turned would say, so and so,  calling each messmate by name, until all had been \"touched off,\" as we  used to call it.    From our camp at the spring we passed into the canyons of the Sierra  Nevada. The days had been excessively hot on the desert, and it was  very cold and frosty in the mountains at night. We soon came to where  the canyons were too narrow for our wagons; then with crowbar and  pickaxe and sledge we went at the jagged rocks until the pass was  sufficiently widened, and with our shoulders to the wheels or by  tugging at ropes we got our train to the summit.    It was while passing through this range of mountains that we first saw  live-oak acorns. They were bitter as wormwood; yet we ate considerable  quantities of them, and as we descended the western slope they became  very abundant, and served for a change. As we passed down to the  valleys we found green mustard, which was boiled and eaten without  pepper or salt.    About this time one of our guides or interpreters brought word from  the governor of San Diego that several battles had been fought by the  California troops and United States forces, and that we might meet a  large Mexican army retreating to Sonora. In consequence of receiving  this news, Colonel Cooke ordered a drill. We had secured a few beef  cattle and some fresh mules, and with this increase of strength and the  prospect of engaging the Mexicans we were spurred on from one mountain  summit to another, pushing and pulling the wagons--a business we were  well versed in, from oft repeated lessons.    At Warner's Ranch, we came to the first house we had seen in  California. Mr. Warner hailed from the state of Massachusetts. From him  the colonel purchased two or three fat beeves. The beef was good, yet  we had nothing to eat with it, not even pepper or salt for seasoning,  and it did not satisfy the cravings of hunger. We rested a day at the  ranch, and some of us wandered off up the creek in hopes of finding  wild fruit or game. We came to a small camp of Indians who were engaged  in hulling and leaching live-oak acorns, then pounding them to a pulp  in stone mortars; this was boiled to a thick mush in home-made earthen  pots. The writer bantered one of the old ladies for about three or four  quarts of that cold-ochre mush, by offering her the belt that held  his pantaloons in place. She accepted the offer, and he, being without  proper utensil to receive his purchase, substituted his hat for a pan,  and the mush was scooped into it. Then when he found himself in the  dilemma of his pantaloons threatening to desert him, he seized the  alternative of holding up that portion of his attire with one hand, and  carrying his hat and its contents in the other, and proceeded to camp,  where his purchase was divided and devoured as a sweet morsel.    From Warner's Ranch we traveled over low hills and camped on a little  narrow flat between two hills. In the night it came on to rain  terribly, and the flat was so flooded that we awoke to find ourselves  half-side deep in water. At dawn one of the boys crawled out of the  water and wet blankets, and crowed; for he had learned that the men who  had been sent back to recover some flour which had been left in the  boat had come in with about four hundred pounds. Soon every man in camp  had heard the glad tidings of the arrival of this expedition, about  which there had been much anxiety.    In a short time the writer was called on by the orderly sergeant of  his company, D, to go with him and receive the portion of flour to be  issued to the company. At the door of the tent where the flour was  being divided we met Col. Cooke, who was sitting with his head down, as  if in deep study. Some of the boys had found a riddle that had fared  better than its owner, and near by one of them struck up the tune  of \"Leather Breeches Full of Stitches,\" or some similar lively air.  Immediately a number of men formed a couple of French fours and began  dancing in water half to their shoe tops. The colonel caught the sound,  started up, and inquired what it was. Some one replied, \"Oh, nothing,  only the boys are dancing and making merry over the prospect of getting  a little flour.\" The colonel shrugged his shoulders and remarked, \"I  never saw such a d--d set of men before in my life. If they can get out  somewhere so they can dry their clothes and have a little flour they  will be as happy as gods!\"    Doubtless the colonel could call to mind often having seen us stagger  into camp, and perhaps could remember a dozen or so of us rush to where  his mule was being fed corn mixed with beans, which the well-fed mule  would object to by throwing his head first one way, then the other,  scattering the half-chewed corn and beans in the sand, where the hungry  soldiers would pick it from, rub it in their hands, and eat it raw; for  to the famishing soldier beans are not so objectionable.    I am reminded at this point in my narrative that three croaking ravens  had followed the command nearly all the way from Santa Fe, for the  bits that escaped the soldier's eye. Surely if it had not been for the  ravens' keener vision they would have left in disgust, and would have  given us a very hard name. Even the wolf might have told his fellows  not to follow such a greedy lot, which did not leave a bone till it was  pounded and boiled and re-boiled till it could not be scented, and if  perchance a bit was found it was too hard for even wolves' teeth.    From this camp we moved to the west under orders from General Kearney  to go to Los Angeles. While on the march toward that point, just as we  emerged from a canyon, we heard the drum and fife in an open valley.  Soon we saw a military force forming in line of battle, and as we drew  nearer we discovered their spears or lances gleaming in the sunlight,  and officers dashing up and down the lines giving commands. Our advance  guard slowed up, and we were ordered to form in line of battle. Every  officer took his place, the command dressed in proper order, and, as we  advanced, comrades looked into each other's faces as if to say, \"How  do you feel about it?\" One asked Alexander Stephens the question, and  received a prompt reply, \"First-rate. I had as lief go into battle as  not. If we must die, the sooner the better, for it seems that we must  be worn till we starve and die anyhow. I do not fear death a particle.\"  Others were heard to say as much, and although the ashy look of death  shone in many faces, from the privations undergone, I do not think  there was a tremor in any heart, or a single man who showed the white  feather.    As we drew near the force in our path, there was a dead silence, as if  awaiting the order to wheel into line and open fire, for we were within  rifle range. Just then "]]]
