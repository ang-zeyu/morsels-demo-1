A great line of railway, which will intersect the       States from south to north, connecting the port of       Mobile on the Gulf of Mexico with Lake Michigan and the       lead mines of Galena on the Upper Mississippi, is also       in progress of construction, large grants of land being       conceded to the company by the Federal Government. This       line will probably be opened in 1854.         It is difficult to obtain authentic reports from which       the movement of the traffic on the American railways       can be ascertained with precision. Dr. Lardner,       however, obtained the necessary statistical data       relating to nearly 1,200 miles of railway in the States       of New England and New York, from which he was enabled       to collect all the circumstances attending the working       of these lines, the principal of which are collected in       the following  table:--    Tabular analysis of the average daily movement of the traffic on 28 of the  principal railways in the States of New England and New York.

The railways, of whose traffic we have here given a       synopsis, are those of the most active and profitable       description in the United States. It would, therefore,       be a great error to infer from the results here       exhibited general conclusions as to the financial       condition of the American railways. It appears, on the       other hand, from a more complete analysis, that the       dividends on the American lines, exclusive of those       contained in the preceding analysis, are in general       small, and in many instances nothing. It is, therefore,       probable that in the aggregate the average profits on       the total amount of capital invested in the American       railways does not exceed, if it indeed equal, the       average profits obtained on the capital invested in       English railways, which we have in a former article       shown to produce little more than 3 per cent.         The extraordinary extent of railway constructed at so       early a period in the United States has been by some       ascribed to the absence of a sufficient extent of       communication by common roads. Although this cause has       operated to some extent in certain districts it is by       no means so general as has been supposed. In the year       1838 the United States' mails circulated over a length       of way amounting on the whole to 136,218 miles, of       which two-thirds were land transport, including       railways as well as common roads. Of the latter there       must have been about 80,000 miles in operation, of       which, however, a considerable portion was       bridle-roads. The price of transport in the stage       coaches was, upon an average, 3.25d. per passenger per       mile, the average price by railway being about 1.47d.       per mile.         Of the entire extent of railway constructed in the       United States, by far the greater portion, as has been       already explained, consists of single lines,       constructed in a light and cheap manner, which in       England would be regarded as merely serving temporary       purposes; while, on the contrary, the entire extent of       the English system consists, not only of double lines,       but of railways constructed in the most solid,       permanent, and expensive manner, adapted to the       purposes of an immense traffic. If a comparison were to       be instituted at all between the two systems, its basis       ought to be the capital expended, and the traffic       served by them, in which case the result would be       somewhat different from that obtained by the mere       consideration of the length of the lines. It is not,       however, the same in reference to the canals, in which       it must be admitted America far exceeds all other       countries in proportion to her population.         The American railways have been generally constructed       by joint stock companies, which, however, the State       controls much more stringently than in England. In some       cases a major limit to the dividends is imposed by the       statute of incorporation, in some the dividends are       allowed to augment, but when they exceed a certain       limit the surplus is divided with the State; in some       the privilege granted to the companies is only for a       limited period, in some a sort of periodical revision       and restriction of the tariff is reserved to the State.       Nothing can be more simple, expeditious, and cheap than       the means of obtaining an act for the establishment of       a railway company in America. A public meeting is held       at which the project is discussed and adopted, a       deputation is appointed to apply to the Legislature,       which grants the act without expense, delay, or       official difficulty. The principle of competition is       not brought into play as in France, nor is there any       investigation as to the expediency of the project with       reference to future profit or loss as in England. No       other guarantee or security is required from the       company than the payment by the shareholders of a       certain amount, constituting the first call. In some       States the non-payment of a call is followed by the       confiscation of the previous payments, in others a fine       is imposed on the shareholders, in others the share is       sold, and if the produce be less than the price at       which it was delivered the surplus can be recovered       from the shareholder by process of law. In all cases       the act creating the companies fix a time within which       the works must be completed, under pain of forfeiture.       The traffic in shares before the definite constitution       of the company is prohibited.         Although the State itself has rarely undertaken the       execution of railways, it holds out in most cases       inducements in different forms to the enterprise of       companies. In some cases the State takes a great number       of shares, which is generally accompanied by a loan       made to the company, consisting in State Stock       delivered at par, which the company negotiate at its       own risk. This loan is often converted into a       subvention.         The great extent of railway communication in America in       proportion to its population must necessarily excite       much admiration. If we take the present population of       the United States at 24,000,000, and the railways in       operation at 10,000 miles, it will follow that in round       numbers there is one mile of railway for every 2,400       inhabitants. Now, in the United Kingdom there are at       present in operation 6,500 miles of railway, and if we       take the population at 30,000,000, it will appear that       there is a mile of railway for every 4,615"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#18)"],[1,"nvestor-in-grain--who  also desired a reputation of virtuosity but did not want to lose money  over it.    As it happens M. Chauchard was well advised. But wonderful as they  are, beautiful as they are, valuable as they are, there is not a  picture here which suggests to the visitor that it ever brought a real  gladness to the eyes of its owner in his own home.    But I can convince you only too easily that M. Chauchard had no taste.  Do you remember when driving out to Longchamp, through the Bois,  either to the Races or to Suresnes, just after you pass the Cascade,  you come on the left to a windmill overlooking the course, and on the  right to a white villa, all alone and unreal? A club house, one  naturally thinks it, for the French Jockey Club, or something of that  kind. You may have forgotten the villa, but you will recall it when I  say that on the very trim vivid lawn in front of it, scattered about,  supposed to be counterfeiting life, are various animals in stone--a  stag, a doe, some dogs, all white and motionless, in the best mortuary  manner, and all, to you and me, outrageous. Well, that was one of M.  Chauchard's homes. M. Chauchard was the owner of that lawn and its  occupants. The man who looking out of his window could feast his eye  on these triumphs of the monumental mason was the same man who bought  for his walls sheep by Jacque and Millet, and cattle and dogs by  Troyon....    No matter. M. Chauchard acquired pictures and left them to the French  Nation, and they are now on view for ever (always excepting the fatal  Continental Mondays) for all to rejoice in. The first really  compellingly beautiful work as one enters--the first picture to touch  the emotions--is Rousseau's \"La Charrette\". It was painted in 1862,  five years before the painter's death, which left the villagers of  Barbizon the richer by a studio-chapel. It is a mere trifle and it is  as wonderful as a summer day: a forest glade, in the midst of which a  tiny wagon and white horse with blue trappings are seen beneath a  burning sky, such a picture as ought to have a wall if not a room to  itself: such a picture as I should like to see placed above an altar.  It is the same subject--a forest wagon--that provided what in some  ways is the best or most attractive Corot here. His \"La Charrette\" is  a large easy landscape lit by the gracious light of which he alone had  the secret. In the foreground is a deep sandy road with the charrette  labouring through it. But before we came to this we had stood before  one of the finest of the seven Daubignys, \"La Seine a Bezons,\" a river  scene of almost terrible calm, with Mont Valerien in the distance and  geese and boats on the near shore, and implicit in it the sincerity,  strength and humility of this great man.    At the end of the room hang two large and busy Troyons, one on each  side of M. Chauchard himself, the donor of the feast, whose bust in  the whitest Carrara, with the whiskers in full fig and the _croix de  grand officier du Legion d'honneur_ meticulously carved upon it,  stands here, as stipulated in the will. These two Troyons, of which  there are eighteen in all, are I think the largest. One represents  cows sauntering lazily down to drink; the other the return from the  market of a mixed herd of cattle and sheep, with a donkey in panniers,  being driven by a man on a white horse. As was his wont, Troyon chose  a road on the edge of a cliff with a very green border of turf and an  exquisite glimpse of sea to the left. None of the new Troyons perhaps  is as fine as those in Salle VIII. of the Louvre proper, but this is a  superb thing. The \"Boeufs se rendant au labour\" and the \"Le Retour a  la ferme\" in Salle VIII. should be visited after the Chauchards.    And so we leave the first and largest room, in the midst of which are  two cases of Barye's bronzes--lions and tigers, bears and deer, snakes  and birds--and enter the first room on the left as we came in; and  here we begin to see for the first time pictures with special knots of  people before them. For the Meissoniers begin here. And of Meissonier  what am I to say? For Meissonier leaves me cold. He is marvellous; but  he leaves me cold. He painted with a fidelity and spirit that border  on the magical; but those qualities that I want in a picture, those  callings of deep to deep, one seeks in vain. Hence I say nothing of  Meissonier, except that he was a master, that there are twenty-six of  his masterpieces here, and that the crowd opposite his \"1814\" extends  to the opposite side. How can one spend time over \"Le cheval de  l'ordonnance\" and the \"Petit Poste de Grand'-Garde\" when Daubigny's  \"Les Laveuses (effet de soleil couchant)\" hangs so near--this great  placid green picture, so profoundly true as to be almost an act of  God? Corot's \"Etang de Ville d'Avray\" is here too, liquid and tender.    The little room that leads out of this is usually almost unenterable  by reason of the press before Meissonier's \"1814\". This undoubtedly is  one of the little great pictures of the world, and I can understand  the enthusiasm of the French sightseer, whose blood is still stirrable  by the enduring personality of the saturnine man on the white horse.  Neighbouring pictures are a rich cattle piece by Diaz, immediately  over \"1814\"; Rousseau's \"La Mare,\" which is not a little like the  Koninck in the Ionides Collection at South Kensington, and the same  painter's \"La Mare au pied du coteau\" with its lovely middle distance.  Here too is one of Corot's many _pecheurs_, who little knew as they  fished on so quietly in the still gentle light that they were being  rendered immortal by the quaint little bourgeois with the long pipe,  sketching on the bank. One of the finest of the Dupres is also  here--\"La Vanne,\" a deep green scene of water.    In the last room we come at last to that painter whose work, next  perhaps to Meissonier's, is the magnet which draws such a steady  stream of worshippers to this new shrine of art--to Jean Francois  Millet. M. Chauchard had eight Millets, including the \"Angelus,\" but  though it is the \"Angelus\" which is considered of many to be the very  core of this collection, I find more pleasure in \"La Bergere gardant  ses moutons\" (reproduced opposite page 308), which I would call, I  think, the best picture of all. It has been remarked that no picture  containing sheep can ever be a bad picture; but when Millet paints  them, and when they are grazing beneath such a sky, and when one of  those grave sweet peasant women--a monument of patient acceptance and  the humility that comes from the soil--is their shepherdess, why then  it is almost too much; and the brave ardent Jacque, whose \"Moutons au  Paturage\" hangs close by, is half suspected of theatricalism. Millet  is so great, so full of large elemental simplicity and truth that one  regrets that his eight pictures have not a room to themselves. That  they should be elbowed by the neat dancing-master _chefs d'oeuvre_  of Meissonier is something of a catastrophe.    Thinking over the collection, I have very strongly the feeling already  expressed that it was wrongly assembled. The investor rather than the  enthusiast is too apparent. M. Chauchard, it is true, refrained from  making money by his acquisitions, since he gave them to the nation,  and this is eternally to his credit. None the less I find it difficult  to esteem him as perhaps one should even in the light of a generous  testator. One so wants pictures to be loved. And of all pictures that  are lovable and that long to pass into their owner's being--to  engentle his eyes and enrich his experience and deepen his  nature--none equal those that were painted by the little group of  friends who in the middle of the last century made the white-walled  village of Barbizon their head-quarters and the Forest of  Fontainebleau their happy hunting-ground and a Wordsworthian passion  for nature their creed.    Such pictures deserve the most faithful owners and the most thoughtful  hospitality....    But if we cannot get all as we wish it, at least we must be grateful  for the next best thing, and to M. Chauchard and the Louvre  authorities we must all be supremely grateful.    The Louvre is to-day the most wonderful museum in the world; but what  would one not give to be able to visit it as it was in 1814, when it  was in some respects more wonderful still. For then it was filled with  the spoils of Napoleon's armies, who had instructions always to bring  back from the conquered cities what they could see that was likely to  beautify and enrich France. It is a reason for war in itself. I would  support any war with Austria, for example, that would bring to London  Count Czernin's Vermeer and the Parmigianino in the Vienna National  Gallery; any war with Germany that would put the Berlin National  Gallery at our disposal. Napoleon had other things to fight for, but  that comprehensive brain forgot nothing, and as he deposed a king he  remembered a blank space in the Louvre that lacked a Raphael, an empty  niche waiting for its Phidias. The Revolution decreed the Museum, but  it was Napoleon who made it priceless and glorious. After the fall of  this man a trumpery era of restitution set in. Many of his noble  patriotic thefts were cancelled out. The world readjusted itself and  shrank into its old pettiness. Priceless pictures and statues were  carried again to Italy and Austria, Napoleon to St. Helena.
