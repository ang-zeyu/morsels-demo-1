Not one of the operas which has  entertained the theaters for the past twenty years can give any  approximate idea of it.    So don't be piqued any longer, or rather, dear friend, be piqued  with curiosity to be one of the first to hear such a beautiful  thing. Sulk with Vienna, for a few weeks at least, instead of  sulking with me, which is all nonsense, and believe me always and  ever your most sincerely attached, but very much occupied, very  much pre-occupied, and oftentimes very absorbed friend,    F. Liszt        69. To Mathilde Graumann    [Given by the addressee, subsequently celebrated as Mathilde  Marchesi, teacher of singing, in \"Aus meinem Leben\" (Bagel,  Dusseldorf)]    Mademoiselle,    Here is the letter for the Grand Master de Luttichau, which M. de  Ziegesar has just written in your honor and glory, with all the  good grace and obligingness which he keeps for you.    As regards introductions to Berlin there is a provoking  contretemps for you. H.R.H. the Princess of Prussia will pass the  winter at Coblentz.    Meyerbeer, to whom I beg you to remember me respectfully, will  certainly be your best patron with the Court, and I have no doubt  that he will receive you with sympathy and interest.    I will also send you, in the course of the week, a letter for the  Chamberlain of H.R.H. Princess Charles of Prussia, which Ziegesar  has promised me.    As to our concert, fixed for the 19th (Saturday next), I assure  you frankly that I should not have ventured to speak to you of  it, and that I hardly venture now.    The receipts are to be devoted to some pension fund, always so  low in funds in our countries; consequently I am not in a  position to propose any suitable terms. Now as, on the occasion  of the performance of the \"Messiah,\" you have already been only  too kind to us, it really would not do for me to return to the  charge, unless you were to authorize me to do so quite directly  and positively, by writing me an epistolary masterpiece somewhat  as follows:--    \"I will sing in a perfunctory manner, but with the best  intentions and the best will in the world, the air from...(here  follows the name of the piece), and the duet from \"Semairamide\"  with Milde or Mademoiselle Aghte, next Saturday; and in order not  to put anybody out, I will arrive at the exact time of the  rehearsal, on Friday at four o'clock.\"    If any such idea as this should come into your head please let me  know (by telegram if need be), so that by Monday night, or, at  latest, Tuesday midday, I may be able to make the programme,  which must appear by Wednesday morning at latest.    With homage and friendship,    F. Liszt    Friday, October 11th, 1850  Be so kind as to give a friendly  shake of the hand from me to Joachim; recommend him not to be too  late in arriving at Weimar, where we expect him for the evening  of the 14th.    P.S.--At the moment when I was going to send my letter to the  post the following lines reached me. I send them to you intact,  and you will see by them that you could not have friends better  disposed towards you than those of Weimar.    Please do not fail to write direct to Ziegesar to thank him for  his kindness, of which you have been sensibly informed by me  (without alluding to his letter, which you will return to me),  and at the same time say exactly which week you will arrive in  Berlin; unless, however, you prefer to come and tell him this  verbally on Friday or Saturday evening at the Altenburg, after  you have again chanted to us and enchanted us. [Literal  translation, on account of play on words.]        70. To Carl Reinecke    Dear Reinecke,    Here are the letters for Berlioz and Erard that I offered you. I  add a few lines for the young Prince Eugene Wittgenstein, with  whom you will easily have pleasant relations; he is an  impassioned musician, and is remarkably gifted with artistic  qualities. In addition, I have had a long talk about your stay in  Paris, and the success which you ought to obtain, with Belloni,  who came to me for a few days. You will find him thoroughly well  disposed to help you by all the means in his power, and I would  persuade you to have complete confidence in him. Go and look for  him as soon as ever you arrive, and ask him for all the practical  information you require. Make your visit to Messrs. Escudier with  him. (N.B.--He will explain why I have not given you a letter for  Brandus.)    The greater number of your pieces have hitherto been printed  exclusively by Escudier, and in my opinion you would do well to  keep well with them in consequence. In your position it is not at  all necessary to make advances to everybody--and, moreover, it is  the very way to have no one for yourself. Look, observe, and keep  an intelligent reserve, and don't cast yourself, German-wise,  precipitately into politeness and inopportune modesty.    In one of your leisure hours Belloni will take you to Madame  Patersi, who is entrusted with the education of my two daughters,  for whom I beg a corner of your kind attention. Play them your  Polonaise and Ballade, and let me hear, later on, how their very  small knowledge of music is going on. Madame Patersi, as I told  you, will have much pleasure in introducing you to her former  pupil, Madame de Foudras, whose salon enjoys an excellent  reputation.    Need I renew to you here the request of my four cardinal points?-  -No, I am sure I need not!--Accept then, dear Reinecke, all my  heartiest wishes for this new year, as well as for your journey  to Paris. Let me hear of you through Belloni, if you have not  time to write to me yourself, and depend in all circumstances on  the very cordial attachment of    Yours sincerely and affectionately,    F. Liszt January 1st, 1851  My return to Weymar is unfortunately  again postponed for twenty days, by the doctor's orders, to which  I submit, although not personal to myself. [They referred to  Princess Wittgenstein, who was ill.]        71. To Leon Escudier, Music Publisher in Paris    [autograph in the possession of M. Arthur Pougin in Paris.--The  addressee was at that time the manager of the periodical \"La  France Musicale,\" in which Liszt's Memoir of Chopin first  appeared in detached numbers (beginning from February 9th,  1851).]    Weymar, February 4th, 1851    My dear Sir,    The proofs of the two first articles of my biographical study of  Chopin ought to have reached you some days ago, for I corrected  and forwarded them immediately on my return to Weymar. You will  also find an indication of how I want them divided, which I shall  be obliged if you will follow. Both on account of the reverence  of my friendship for Chopin, and my desire to devote the utmost  care to my present and subsequent publications, it is important  to me that this work should make its appearance as free from  defects as possible, and I earnestly request you to give most  conscientious attention to the revision of the last proofs. Any  alterations, corrections, and additions must be made entirely in  accordance with my directions, so that the definitive  publication, which it would be opportune to begin at once in your  paper, may satisfy us and rightly fulfill the aim we have in  view. If therefore your time is too fully occupied to give you  the leisure to undertake these corrections, will you be so good  as to beg M. Chavee [an eminent Belgian linguist, at that time a  collaborator on the \"France Musicale\"] (as you propose) to do me  this service with the scrupulous exactitude which is requisite,  for which I shall take the opportunity of expressing to him  personally my sincere thanks?    In the matter of exactitude you would have some right to reproach  me (I take it kindly of you to have passed it over in silence,  but I have nevertheless deserved your reproaches, apparently at  least) with regard to Schubert's opera [\"Alfonso and Estrella,\"  which Liszt produced at Weimar in 1854]. I hope Belloni has  explained to you that the only person whom I can employ to make a  clear copy of this long work has been overwhelmed, up to now,  with pressing work. It will therefore be about three months  before I can send you the three acts, the fate of which I leave  in your hands, and for which, by the aid of an interesting  libretto, we may predict good luck at the Opera Comique. I will  return to this matter more in detail when I am in the position to  send you the piano score (with voice), to which, as yet, I have  only been able to give some too rare leisure hours, but which I  promise you I will not put off to the Greek Calends!    As far as regards my opera, allow me to thank you for the  interest you are ready to take in it. For my own part I have made  up my mind to work actively at the score. I expect to have a copy  of it ready by the end of next autumn. We will then see what can  be done with it, and talk it over.    Meanwhile accept, my dear sir, my best thanks and compliments.    F. Liszt    The proofs of the third and fourth articles on Chopin will be  posted to you tomorrow.    Has Belloni spoken to you about F. David's \"Salon Musical\"  (twenty-four pieces of two pages each, very elegantly written and  easy to play)?--I can warmly recommend this work to you, both  from the point of view of art, and of a profitable, and perhaps  even popular, success.

Why the  creature was engaged in blowing this bubble I do not know, and have not  met with another instance of such conduct.          CHAPTER XI.    NOVEMBER.        Characteristics of the Polyzoa--Details of structure according          to Allman--Plumatella repens--Its great beauty under proper          illumination--Its tentacles and their cilia--The mouth and its          guard or epistome--Intestinal tube--How it swallowed a Rotifer,          and what happened--Curiosities of digestion--Are the tentacles          capable of Stinging?--Resting Eggs, or \"Statoblasts\"--Tube of          Plumatella--Its muscular Fibres--Physiological importance of          their structure.      During the fag end of last month I observed some fragments of a new  creature among some bits of Anacharis, from the Vale of Heath Pond, and  searched for complete and intelligible specimens without effect. Luckily  one evening a scientific neighbour, to whom I had given some of the  plant for the sake of the beautiful _Stephanoceri_ which inhabited it,  came in with a glass trough containing a little branch, to which adhered  a dirty parchment-like ramifying tube, dotted here and there with brown  oval masses, and having sundry open extremities, from which some  polyp-shaped animals put forth long pearly tentacles margined with  vibrating cilia, and making a lively current. The creatures presented an  organization higher than that of polyps, for there was an evident  _differentiation_ and complication of parts. They belonged to the  _Polyzoa_ or _Bryozoa_,[21] a very important division of the _mollusca_.  The _Polyzoa_ are chiefly marine, and the common \"sea-mat,\" often  erroneously treated as a _sea-weed_, is a well-known form. A species of  another order often picked up on our coasts is the _Sertularia_, or  Sea-Fir, composed of delicate branching stems of a horny-looking  substance, which, under a pocket-lens, is found to contain an immense  number of small cells inhabited by Polyps. It is instructive to compare  the two and note how much more advanced in structure is the Polyzoon  than the polyp.    [21] _Polyzoa_ means \"many animals,\" in allusion to their habit of  living in association. _Bryozoa_, \"moss-animals,\" from some forming  cells having that appearance.    [Illustration: Plumatella repens. Single Polypide enlarged]    Polyzoa were formerly associated with the polyps, to which they bear a  strong superficial resemblance; but they are of a much higher degree of  organization, as will be seen by comparing what has been said in a  former chapter on the _Hydra_, with the description which we now proceed  to abridge from Dr. Allman's splendid monograph on the fresh-water  kinds. In order to get a general conception of a Polyzoon, the Professor  tells us to imagine an alimentary canal, consisting of oesophagus,  stomach, and intestine, to be furnished at its origin with long ciliated  tentacles, and to have a single nervous ganglion on one side of the  oesophagus. We must then conceive the intestine bent back till its  anal orifice comes near the mouth; and this curved digestive tube to be  suspended in a bag containing fluid, and having two openings, one for  the mouth and the other for the vent. A system of muscles enables the  alimentary tube to be retracted or protruded, the former process pulling  the bag in, and the latter letting it out. The mouth of the bag is, so  to speak, tied round the creature's neck just below the tentacles, which  are the only portions of it that are left free. The investing sack has  in nearly every case the power of secreting an external sheath, more or  less solid, and which branches forming numerous cells, in which the  members of the family live in a socialistic community, having, as it  were, two lives, one individual, and the other shared in common with the  rest.    The whole group of tubes and cells, whatever may be the form in which  they are aggregated, is called the _Polypary_, or, as Dr. Allman  prefers, the _Coenoecium_ (common house); the creature he names a  _Polypide_[22] (polyp-like); and the disk which bears the tentacles  _Lophophore_ (crest-bearer). There are some more hard words to be learnt  before the student can enjoy himself scientifically among the Polyzoa,  and we shall be compelled to employ some of them before we have done;  but will now endeavour to describe what was presented to our view by the  specimen obtained from the Hampstead Pond.    [22] _Polyzoon_ is preferable, as avoiding confusion with _polypite_,  used for another class of object.    The general aspect of a branch of _Plumatella repens_--the creature we  have to describe--is given in the drawing annexed. When all was quiet,  the mouths of the bags belonging to each cell were slowly everted, and  out came a numerous bundle of tentacles, which were either spread like  the corolla of a flower, or permitted to hang dishevelled like the  snake-locks of Medusa. We will suppose these organs symmetrically  expanded, and that we are looking down upon them with a magnifying power  of sixty diameters, the light having been carefully adjusted by turning  the reflecting mirror a little on one side, to avoid a direct glare. The  tentacles, each of which curves with a living grace, and displays an  opaline tint in its glassy structure, do not form a complete circle, for  at one place we discern two slightly diverging arms of the disk, or  frame (Lophophore) from which they grow.    These arms support tentacles on each side, and leave a gap between, so  that the whole pattern is _crescentic_, or crescent-shaped, and not  circular. Extending as far as the points of the arms, and carried all  round the crescent, is an extremely delicate membrane, like the finest  gauze, which unites all the tentacles by their basal portions, and makes  an elegant retreating curve between every two. Each tentacle exhibits  two rows of cilia, which scintillate as their vibrations cause them to  catch the light. The motion of the cilia is invariably _down_ one side  and _up_ the other, the current or pattern being carried on from one  tentacle to the other, all through the series. This characteristic, and  the facility with which each cilium can be distinguished, gives great  interest and beauty to the spectacle of this wonderful apparatus, by  which water-currents are made to bathe the tentacles, and assist  respiration, and also to carry food towards the mouth, over which a sort  of finger or tongue is stretched to guard the way, and exercise some  choice as to what particles shall be permitted to pass on. This organ is  called the _epistome_, from two Greek words, signifying \"upon the  mouth.\"    If the cell is an old one, it may be covered with so much extraneous  matter as to obscure the economy within; but we are fortunate in having  a transparent specimen before us, through which we can see all that goes  on. The alimentary tube, after forming a capacious cavity, much longer  than it is broad, turns round and terminates in an orifice near the  mouth, and just below the integuments. When refuse has to be discharged,  this orifice is protruded; and after the operation is over, it draws  back as before. Long muscles, composed of separate threads or fibres,  pull the creature in and out of its cell, and at the part where the  stomach ends, and the intestine turns round, is attached a long flexible  rope, called the _funiculus_, which goes to the bottom of the cell. The  passage of the food down to the stomach, its digestion, and the eviction  of the residue, can all be watched; and when a large morsel is  swallowed, the spectacle is curious in the extreme.    One day a polyzoon caught a large rotifer, (_R. vulgaris_,) which, with  several others of its tribe, had been walking over the _coenoecium_,  and swimming amongst the tentacles, as if unconscious of danger. All of  a sudden it went down the whirlpool leading to the mouth, was rolled up  by a process that could not be traced, and without an instant's loss of  time, was seen shooting down in rapid descent to the gulf below, where  it looked a potato-shaped mass, utterly destitute of its characteristic  living form. Having been made into a bolus, the unhappy rotifer, who  never gave the faintest sign of vitality, was tossed up and down from  the top to the bottom of the stomach, just as a billiard-ball might be  thrown from the top to the bottom of a stocking. This process went on  for hours, the ball gradually diminishing in size, until at last it was  lost in the general brown mass with which the stomach was filled. The  bottom of the stomach seems well supplied with muscular fibres, to cause  the constrictions by which this work is chiefly performed, and by  keeping a colony for a month or two, I had many opportunities of seeing  my Polyzoa at their meals.    When alarmed the tentacles were quickly retracted, but although these  creatures are said to dislike the light, and usually keep away from it  in their native haunts, my specimens had no objection to come out in a  strong illumination, and seemed perfectly at their ease. They were  indeed most amiable creatures, and never failed to display their charms  to admiring visitors, who rewarded them with unmeasured praise. Twice I  had an opportunity of observing an action I cannot explain, except by  supposing either that the tentacles of the _Plumatella_ have some  poisonous action, or that rotifers are susceptible of fear. On these  occasions the common rotifer was the subject of the experiment. First  one and then another got among the tentacles, and on escaping seemed  very poorly. One fellow was, to borrow a phrase from Professor Thomas  Sayers, \"completely doubled up,\" and two or three seconds--long periods  in a rotifer's life--elapsed before he came to himself again.
