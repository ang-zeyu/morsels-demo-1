His  example and encouraging words restore hope to the combatants and revive  their courage. Each man, under the eyes of their general, shows new  energy, and this heroic devotedness begins to cool the impetuosity of  the enemy. Not far thence, the 7th legion was pressed by a multitude of  assailants. Caesar orders the tribunes gradually to bring the two legions  back to back, so that each presented its front to the enemy in opposite  directions. Fearing no longer to be taken in the rear, they resist with  firmness, and fight with new ardour. While Caesar is thus occupied, the  two legions of the rear-guard, which formed the escort of the baggage  (the 13th and 14th), informed of what was taking place, arrive in haste,  and appear in view of the enemy at the top of the hill. On his part, T.  Labienus, who, at the head of the 9th and 10th legions, had made himself  master of the enemy's camp on the heights of Haumont, discovers what is  passing in the Roman camp. He judges, by the flight of the cavalry and  servants, the greatness of the danger with which Caesar is threatened,  and sends the 10th legion to his succour, which, re-passing the Sambre,  and climbing the slopes of Neuf-Mesnil, runs in haste to fall upon the  rear of the Nervii.    On the arrival of these re-enforcements, the whole aspect of things  changes: the wounded raise themselves, and support themselves on their  bucklers in order to take part in the action; the valets, seeing the  terror of the enemy, throw themselves unarmed upon men who are armed;  and the cavalry,[265] to efface the disgrace of their flight, seek to  outdo the legionaries in the combat. Meanwhile the Nervii fight with the  courage of despair. When those of the first ranks fall, the nearest take  their places, and mount upon their bodies; they are slain in their turn;  the dead form heaps; the survivors throw, from the top of this mountain  of corpses, their missiles upon the Romans, and send them back their own  _pila_. \"How can we, then, be astonished,\" says Caesar, \"that such men  dared to cross a broad river, climb its precipitous banks, and overcome  the difficulties of the ground, since nothing appeared too much for  their courage?\" They met death to the last man, and 60,000 corpses  covered the field of battle so desperately fought, in which the fortune  of Caesar had narrowly escaped wreck.    After this struggle, in which, according to the \"Commentaries,\" the race  and name of the Nervii were nearly annihilated, the old men, women, and  children, who had sought refuge in the middle of the marshes, finding no  hopes of safety, surrendered.[266] In dwelling on the misfortune of  their country, they said that, of 600 senators, there remained only  three; and that, of 60,000 combatants, hardly 500 had survived. Caesar,  to show his clemency towards the unfortunate who implored it, treated  these remains of the Nervii with kindness; he left them their lands and  towns, and enjoined the neighbouring peoples not only not to molest  them, but even to protect them from all outrage and violence.[267]      [Sidenote: Siege of the _Oppidum_ of the Aduatuci.]    VIII. This victory was gained, no doubt, towards the end of July. Caesar  detached the 7th legion, under the orders of young P. Crassus, to reduce  the maritime peoples of the shores of the ocean: the Veneti, the Unelli,  the Osismii, the Curiosolitae, the Essuvii, the Aulerci, and the Redones.  He proceeded in person, with the seven other legions, following the  course of the Sambre, to meet the Aduatuci, who, as we have seen above,  were marching to join the Nervii. They were the descendants of those  Cimbri and Teutones who, in their descent upon the Roman province and  Italy in the year 652, had left on this side the Rhine 6,000 men in  charge of as much of the baggage as was too heavy to be carried with  them. After the defeat of their companions by Marius, and many  vicissitudes, these Germans had established themselves towards the  confluence of the Sambre and the Meuse, and had there formed a state.    As soon as the Aduatuci were informed of the disaster of the Nervii,  they returned to their own country, abandoned their towns and forts, and  retired, with all they possessed, into one _oppidum_, remarkably  fortified by nature. Surrounded in every direction by precipitous rocks  of great elevation, it was accessible only on one side by a gentle  slope, at most 100 feet wide, defended by a fosse and double wall of  great height, on which they placed enormous masses of rock and pointed  beams. The mountain on which the citadel of Namur is situated[268]  answers sufficiently to this description. (_See Plate 11._)    On the arrival of the army, they made at first frequent sorties, and  engaged in battles on a small scale. Later, when the place was  surrounded by a countervallation of twelve feet high in a circuit of  15,000 feet,[269] with numerous redoubts, they kept close in their  _oppidum_. The Romans pushed forward their covered galleries, raised a  terrace under shelter of these galleries, and constructed a tower of  timber, intended to be pushed against the wall. At the sight of these  preparations, the Aduatuci, who, like most of the Gauls, despised the  Romans on account of their small stature, addressed the besiegers  ironically from their walls, not understanding how a great machine,  placed at a great distance, could be put in motion by men so diminutive.  But when they saw this tower move and approach the walls, struck with a  sight so strange and so new to them, they sent to implore peace,  demanding, as the only condition, that they should be left in possession  of their arms. Caesar refused this condition, but declared that, if they  surrendered before the ram had struck their wall, they should be placed,  like the Nervii, under the protection of the Roman people, and preserved  from all violence. The besieged thereupon threw such a quantity of arms  into the fosses that they filled them almost to the height of the wall  and the terrace; yet, as was afterwards discovered, they had retained  about one-third. They threw open their gates, and that day remained  quiet.    The Romans had occupied the town; towards evening, Caesar ordered them to  leave it, fearing the violences which the soldiers might commit on the  inhabitants during the night. But these, believing that after the  surrender of the place the posts of the countervallation would be  guarded with less care, resume the arms they had concealed, furnish  themselves with bucklers of bark of trees, or wicker, covered hastily  with skins, and, at midnight, attack the part of the works which seems  most easy of access. Fires, prepared by Caesar, soon announce the attack.  The soldiers rush to the spot from the nearest redoubts; and, though the  enemies fight with the obstinacy of despair, the missiles thrown from  the entrenchments and the towers disperse them, and they are driven back  into the town with a loss of 4,000 men. Next day the gates were broken  in without resistance, and, the town once taken, the inhabitants were  sold publicly to the number of 53,000.[270]      [Sidenote: Subjugation of Armorica by P. Crassus]    IX. Towards the time of the conclusion of this siege (the first days of  September), Caesar received letters from P. Crassus. This lieutenant  announced that the maritime peoples on the coasts of the ocean, from the  Loire to the Seine, had submitted. On the arrival of this news at Rome,  the Senate decreed fifteen days of thanksgivings.[271]    These successful exploits, and Gaul entirely pacified, gave to the  barbarian peoples so high an opinion of the Roman power, that the  nations beyond the Rhine, particularly the Ubii, sent deputies to Caesar,  offering hostages and obedience to his orders. Anxious to proceed to  Italy and Illyria, he commanded the deputies to return to him at the  commencement of the following spring, and placed his legions, with the  exception of the 12th, in winter quarters, in the countries of the  Carnutes, the Andes, and the Turones, neighbouring upon the localities  where Crassus had been making war.[272] They were probably _echelonnes_  in the valley of the Loire, between Orleans and Angers.      [Sidenote: Expedition of Galba into the Valais.]    X. Before he departed for Italy, Caesar sent Servius Galba, with a part  of the cavalry and the 12th legion, into the country of the Nantuates,  the Veragri, and the Seduni (_peoples of Chablais and Lower and Upper  Valais_), whose territory extended from the country of the Allobroges,  Lake Leman, and the Rhone, to the summit of the Alps. His object was to  open an easy communication with Italy by way of these mountains, that  is, by the Simplon and the St. Bernard, where travellers were  continually subject to exactions and vexations. Galba, after some  successful battles, by which all these peoples were subdued, obtained  hostages, placed two cohorts among the Nantuates, and the rest of his  legions in a town of the Veragri called Octodurus (_Martigny_). This  town, situated in a little plain at the bottom of a glen surrounded by  high mountains, was divided into two parts by a river (_the Drance_).  Galba left one bank to the Gauls, and established his troops on the  other, which he fortified with a fosse and rampart.    Several day had passed in the greatest tranquillity, when Galba learnt  suddenly that the Gauls had during the night evacuated the part of the  town which they occupied, and that the Veragri and the Seduni were  appearing in great numbers on the surrounding mountains. The situation  was most critical; for not only could Galba reckon on no succour, but he  had not even finished his retrenchments, or gathered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#18)"],[1,"and sports prowess in days gone by.    Over his fighting experiences, however, a veil was drawn; and  seeing that even to hint a question about it was to bring a look of  unutterable terror, of trench-haunted madness into his eyes, the  subject was left in abeyance.    Being neither wounded nor sick, nor attached to the regiment at the  base, it was usually assumed that he was an officer's servant, which  assumption was corroborated by the amount of spare time on his hands,  for he seemed always at the canteen.    One day he came to the man in charge with the request that he should  find him some remunerative work. Amazed, the civilian asked, \"Why?  Aren't you drawing your pay?\" Then the truth leaked out. Months back,  during an infantry advance, in a fit of madness he had boarded a  passing ambulance and found himself at the base. In plain words, he  was a deserter. For weeks he had lived, evading the canny A.P.M.'s  minions by the skin of his teeth, sleeping one night in a barn, the  next in a railway truck, the third on the sands, and always feeding at  the canteen. A dozen times he had thought the game was up. The strain  was beginning to tell, and now that he was down to his last sou there  was nothing left for it but to give himself up or cut and run.    Well, for the sake of the wife he was going to risk it.    He did so. But the authorities who scrutinise those little seemingly  useless papers on the boat were too sharp for him, and he passed for  ever out of the life of the only civilian who knew his story--to be  exact, out of the lives of all his friends.    And is not slackness at home all the more reprehensible when one  realises the penalties to which men O.A.S. are liable? Is it to be  wondered at that we in France would gladly hear the death-sentence  passed on every one of those traitor strikers?      _May 17th._ Far, far out, the fisher-folk, their hair and faces white  with brine, are shrimping. So far out is the tide that they are mere  dark specks against the red glow. Farther along the coast a number  of A.V.C. officers from remount camps are enjoying a chukker of polo  on the firm sands. The sound of heavy firing that had been so audible  during the afternoon in the Dover-Calais direction has ceased. The  friends who had come out to visit the invalids have departed by the  last tram, on which a tall Sikh was busy teaching the French conductor  to talk English. The result may be better pictured than described. When  they set to work to do a little bartering, ransacking each other's  pockets for souvenirs, exchanging two pencils for a cigarette, a penny  for a halfpenny, it was interesting to note that the businesslike  Frenchman--the bargainer _par excellence_--had met his match at last.    And to-morrow a month's sick leave in Blighty! Baths unlimited! Beef  that is beef and not horse! Lamb that is lamb and not goat! Every fibre  aches for civilisation.      _May 23rd, London._ No doubt the waitress at the terminus was rather  amused by the arrival of three travel-stained creatures, one in mufti  and two in uniform, whose first demand was for glasses of clear, cold  water. But could she have known she would have been astonished to find  that, in spite of our bad crossing, our hunger, and the subsequent good  dishes she set before us, none of us remembered _anything_ half as good  as this first unboiled, unchlorinated, unsterilised draught.    It is impossible to blame anyone for failing to take war seriously at  home. Here, where \"business as usual\" is the motto, it is literally  inconceivable that anything extraordinary is going on in the world.  No wonder that a certain number of women were prating recently of  the forthcoming Peace Conference at The Hague. Even those who are  worst hit, who have lost their nearest and dearest, are so engrossed  in their little charities, their bandage-making and knitting and Red  Cross lectures, that they have little leisure to mope. London is as  gay or gayer than ever, not a bit purged, for every man home on leave  is busy making the best of time. How different from the Frenchman,  whose one idea on getting out of the trenches is to set his house in  order, to instruct the women who are doing his work how to manipulate  the latest agricultural implements, to help prepare for the harvest!  Aldershot and its vicinity, for all the many lives that have passed out  of it for ever, is the same. And here, in the big country houses one  visits, people have still leisure to indulge in nerve attacks at the  sight of their milliners' bills. Even the rise of that new species,  the very temporary gentleman officer, is less remarkable at home. The  only change one notices (bar a few dances and cricket matches that have  been skipped, maybe out of respect for those who will dance and play no  more) is the Continental atmosphere of the streets and theatres.    London is almost as Belgian as Boulogne is anglicised. Rotund Belgians  sit knitting in the stalls, their sombre day dresses contrasting  strangely with our erstwhile brilliant audiences.    \"Evening dress optional but unfashionable,\" as one theatre announces.    A joy for ever is the element of free-and-easy good-humour brought over  by our Colonials. If the last ten months have done no other good, they  have at least knit together, in bonds that can never be riven, our  wonderful Empire.          CHAPTER IX    June, 1915      _June 11th--Cumberland._ Speaking to a gathering of village folk on  work in France, I invited debate. \"If King George 'as got wot Kaiser  Bill wants, why don't they go and fight it out themselves?\" asked one  man. \"Wot difference would it make to us if the country is ruled by  Germans or Englishmen?\" said another, a lazy fellow whose fields had  remained fallow for years, quite oblivious of the fact that under  German regime _he_ would have been in the firing-line months ago. The  rest of the audience shivered with the helpless indecision as to what  their right course should be: which shows the little faith felt in the  present Government, half hoping for, half fearing the conscription of  labour that seems imminent.    That there should exist men who openly confess that from their point of  view the end of the war will be disastrous is almost incredible. Yet  I have come across a clergyman, working in a Midland manufacturing  centre, who has many instances of this indifference to recount.    Is it not useless to hope that this war will be the last? So long as  men are actuated by motives of commercial profit and agrarian gain,  the dream of Universal Peace must remain a chimaera; and the present  upheaval, essential to the checking and wiping out of Germany's  abnormal line of development, is destined to be only the first step  towards the Ideal of Progress which Europe (the Central Powers  included) had flattered herself to be following.    Most astounding of all is the utter obliviousness on the part of all  at home to the seriousness of the shell campaign, illustrated by the  ridicule hurled at those of us who uphold the Northcliffe Press.    As I settled into the corner of the railway carriage, after a  delightful week-end with a dear friend in Surrey, a batch of  illustrated journals and the _Morning Post_ were pressed upon me.    No one can be a more devout devotee of the _Morning Post_ Court  Circular than my humble self, knowing full well that to miss that  interesting document means a gradual drifting without the pale of  one's many acquaintances. Nevertheless, I asked meekly for \"The _Daily  Mail_, please!\"    \"That you, with your love of literature, should read such stuff!\" she  groaned.    Then, confidently:    \"My dear, at any other time I should have _cut you dead_ for such a  thing.\"    There was no time to explain, as the train steamed out, that I go to my  newspaper for news and not for literature.    Yet I could not refrain from marvelling at the contumely showered on  the only organ strong enough to bring the truth before the public and  combat the weaknesses of a desultory Government.    The second astounding thing at home is the fact that no one seems to  realise the difference between the Front and the Base.    Anywhere in France--Paris excepted--seems to be \"the Front,\" and no one  who has not been privileged to peep behind the scenes seems to realise  the gap that intervenes between the fighting line and the back of the  Front, as one might call the Base.    And one is introduced to a strange medley of people, all \"going to the  Front.\"    Not only veteran soldiers and raw recruits and nurses, but charming  women of leisure who contemplate migrating with their retinue somewhere  abroad and earning fame \"at a canteen or anything that is wanted--just  behind the lines!\"    Now, although I can claim to have worked longer at our Base than  any other British woman (with one exception), to have withstood  the inclemency of its climate and its laws successfully for eight  consecutive months, and might therefore pretend to be an authority  as to where it really _is_, not a single friend have I succeeded in  convincing that I am not a true heroine--risking my life daily with  shells bursting all around and the Huns a few yards away. What they  want are descriptions of weeping gas victims and death-bed scenes (that  in reality are far better forgotten--if it is possible) and incidents  such as a youthful convalescent sapper confided to me recently--of the  man who, though his head was blown clean off at midday, was found to be  convulsively clawing the earth with fingers that seemed yet alive at  sundown!    For such yarns there seems to be a great demand, and if I told  them that heroism at the Base consisted of maintaining continual  cheerfulness in face of odds like bursting boilers which, for want  of men, cannot be repaired; if I hinted at the dullness of buttering  endless loaves, of wheedling Primus stoves into working order, of  changing French money for"]]]
