Born in 1478, he passed at that court several years  of his family's exile from Florence; nor was he ungrateful for the  splendid hospitality he there enjoyed, for, while he lived, his  influence with his brother, Leo X., averted those designs against  the dukedom, which were directed to his own aggrandisement. After  the restoration of the Medici, Leo confided to him the government of  Florence, which he endeavoured to administer in the spirit of his  father, and succeeded in gaining the good will of the people. But  the Pope was not satisfied with the re-establishment of his race as  sovereigns of that republic; and the fine qualities and vast ideas  of Giuliano suggested him as a fit instrument of further grasping  schemes. To realise these, Leo coquetted between France and Spain,  and, like his predecessors, sacrificed the peace of Italy. The prizes  which he successively proposed for Giuliano, who, by resigning  Florence into the hands of his nephew Lorenzo, the heir-male of his  house, was free to accept whatever sovereignty might be had, were  the duchy of Milan, a state in Eastern Lombardy and Ferrara, or the  crown of Naples. In June, 1515, the Pontiff conferred on him the  insignia of gonfaloniere and captain-general of the Church; but he  was prevented from active service by a fever which cut him off in  the following March, when only thirty-eight, not without suspicion  of poison at the hands of his nephew Lorenzo. His name is enshrined  in Bembo's prose and Ariosto's verse, whilst his tomb by Michael  Angelo in the Medicean Chapel, which Rogers, with a quaint but happy  antithesis, calls \"the most real and unreal thing which ever came  from the chisel,\" is one of the glories of art.[*41] Shortly before  his death he had married Filiberta of Savoy, whose nephew, Francis  I., created him Duke of Nemours, and, had his life been prolonged,  would probably have aided him to further aggrandisement.    [Footnote *41: Giuliano was not so bad a poet himself. Cf. on this  subject SERASSI, in the Annotazioni to the _Tirsi_ of Castiglione at  stanza 43, and the five sonnets contained in _Cod. Palat._, 206 (_I  Cod. Palat. della Nazionale Centrale di Firenze_, vol. I., fasc. 4),  and the six of _Cod. Magliabech._ II., I., 60 (BARTOLI, _I manoscritti  della Bib. Nazionale di Firenze_, tom. I., p. 38).]    During his residence at Urbino, from an intrigue with Pacifica  Brandani, a person of high rank or base condition, for both extremes  have been conjectured to account for the mystery, there was born to  him a son, who, after being exposed in the streets in 1511, was sent  to the foundling hospital, and baptized Pasqualino. Removed to Rome  and acknowledged in 1513, the child received an excellent education;  and under the munificent patronage of the Medici became Cardinal  Ippolito, whose tastes were more for arms than mass-books, and whose  handsome features and gallant bearing, expressive of his splendid  character, are preserved to us in the Pitti Gallery by the gorgeous  tints of Titian, alone worthy of such a subject.           *       *       *       *       *    The next personage of this goodly company was CESARE  GONZAGA, descended from a younger branch of the Mantuan  house, and cousin-german of Count Baldassare, whose quarters he  shared in 1504, when they returned together from the reduction of  Valentino's strongholds in Romagna, where he had the command of fifty  men-at-arms. We know little of him beyond his having been a knight of  St. John of Jerusalem, and ambassador from Leo X. to Charles V.[*42]  Baldi describes him as not less distinguished by merit than blood,  and Castiglione assigns him a prominent place in the lively circle  whose amusements he depicts. He was no unsuccessful devotee of the  muses: a graceful canzonet by him is preserved in the Rime Scelte of  Atanagi, and he shares the credit of the eclogue of _Tirsis_ already  alluded to, and printed among the works of Castiglione. Recommended  by military talent, as well as by diplomatic dexterity and business  habits, he remained in the service of Duke Francesco Maria during his  early campaigns; and in September, 1512, after reducing Bologna to  obedience of the Pope, died there of an acute fever in the flower of  his age.    [Footnote *42: SERASSI, in _Poesie volgari e latine del B.C.  aggiunti alcune Rime e Lettere di Cesare Gonzaga_ (Roma, 1760), gives  a full notice of his life, and CASTIGLIONE, in the Fourth  Book of the _Cortegiano_, speaks affectionately of him.]           *       *       *       *       *    The brothers OTTAVIANO and FEDERIGO FREGOSO were  of a Genoese family, who for above a century had distinguished  themselves in the military, naval, and civil service of their  country, and had given several doges to that republic. Their father,  Agostino Fregoso, had married Gentile, natural daughter of Duke  Federigo, and the young men were consequently much brought up at  the court of Urbino, where their sisters Margherita and Costanza  were long in attendance on Duchess Elisabetta. In 1502, Ottaviano  accompanied his uncle on his first return from Venice, and we have  seen him then defending S. Leo during a lengthened siege, sustained  with great gallantry and skill. For that good service he had from  the Duke the countship of Sta. Agatha in the Apennines, afterwards  confirmed to him by an honourable brief of Leo X., and continued to  his descendants, with the title of Vicar, until their extinction in  the third generation.    The latter period of Ottaviano's life was actively passed in his  native city. From 1512 his endeavours were directed to abolish the  French domination maintained at that time by aid of the Adorni,  long hereditary rivals of his family. In this he finally succeeded,  and next year was elected doge, the only one, in Litta's opinion,  \"who gloriously manifested a desire for the public weal.\" He held  that dignity during two years of tranquillity to his country, over  which the benign influence of his mild and impartial sway diffused a  temporary calm, long unknown to its factious inhabitants. So obvious  were these beneficial results, that Francis I., on becoming master  of Genoa in 1515, continued to him a delegated authority as its  governor. But, seven years later, the restless Adorni, having adhered  to the Emperor, aided the Marquis of Pescara to carry the city,  with an army of imperialists, who mercilessly sacked it. Ottaviano  remained a prisoner in the enemy's hands, and died soon after. He is  called in the _Cortegiano_ \"a man the most singularly magnanimous  and religious of our day, full of goodness, genius, prudence, and  courtesy; a true friend to honour and virtue, and so worthy of praise  that even his enemies are constrained to extend it to him.\" The  revolution effected by Andrea Doria, in 1528, forcibly closed the  feuds of these rival families, which, during a century and a half,  had outraged public order, and, both being compelled to change their  name, the Fregosi adopted that of Fornaro.           *       *       *       *       *    FEDERIGO FREGOSO, the younger brother of Ottaviano,  born in 1480, was educated for holy orders under the eye of his  maternal uncle Guidobaldo. In the lettered society of Urbino he  perfected himself in various accomplishments, as well as in a  thorough knowledge of the world, which enabled him afterwards to  acquit himself usefully and creditably in many diversified spheres  of action. It was to the great satisfaction of that court that in  April, 1507, Julius II. conferred upon him the archbishopric of  Salerno, a benefice which the opposition of Ferdinand II., founded  on his leaning to French interests, apparently prevented him from  enjoying. His life of literary ease remained uninterrupted until  his brother's elevation as doge of Genoa in 1513, when he hastened  to support him by his counsels and influence. During the next nine  years he alternately commanded the army of the republic, led her  fleet against the Barbary pirates, whom he annihilated in their own  harbours, and represented her as ambassador at the papal court.  The revolution of 1522 compelled him to fly from his native city,  and, taking refuge in France, he received protection and preferment  from Francis I. He returned to Italy in 1529, and was appointed to  the see of Gubbio, where his piety, and devotion to the spiritual  and temporal welfare of his flock, were equally commendable, and  gained him the appellation of father of the poor and refuge of the  distressed. A posthumous imputation of heretical error cast upon his  name had no better foundation than the accident of his discourse  upon prayer happening to be reprinted along with a work of Luther,  which occasioned their being both consigned to the Index. In 1539 he  was made cardinal by Paul III., and died at Gubbio two years after.  His attainments in philology were eminent, including a profound  knowledge of Hebrew, with the study of which he is said to have  consoled his exile in France. Equal cultivation might have gained  him much fame as a poet, but the works he has left are chiefly of  a doctrinal character, and his eminence in the literary circle of  his day rests more upon the correspondence of Bembo, Sadoleto, and  Cortesio than upon his own writings.[*43] By the first of these, the  sparkle of his measured wit, the general moderation and suavity of  his manners, his gentle consideration for other men's habits, his  personal accomplishments, and the zeal displayed in his studies,  are all spoken of with warm admiration.

If my friend O'Rell's theory be true, how barren would be Age! Lord  Bacon tells us in his \"Apothegms\" that Alonzo of Aragon was wont to  say, in commendation of Age, that Age appeared to be best in four  things:  Old wood best to burn; old wine to drink; old friends to  trust; and old authors to read.  Sir John Davys recalls that \"a French  writer (whom I love well) speaks of three kinds of companions:  Men,  women and books,\" and my revered and beloved poet-friend, Richard Henry  Stoddard, has wrought out this sentiment in a poem of exceeding beauty,  of which the concluding stanza runs in this wise:          Better than men and women, friend,        That are dust, though dear in our joy and pain,    Are the books their cunning hands have penned,        For they depart, but the books remain;    Through these they speak to us what was best        In the loving heart and the noble mind;    All their royal souls possessed        Belongs forever to all mankind!    When others fail him, the wise man looks    To the sure companionship of books.      If ever, O honest friends of mine, I should forget you or weary of your  companionship,  whither would depart the memories and the associations  with which each of you is hallowed!  Would ever the modest flowers of  spring-time, budding in pathways where I no longer wander, recall to my  failing sight the vernal beauty of the Puritan maid, Captivity?  In  what reverie of summer-time should I feel again the graciousness of thy  presence, Yseult?    And Fanchonette--sweet, timid little Fanchonette! would ever thy ghost  come back from out those years away off yonder? Be hushed, my Beranger,  for a moment; another song hath awakened softly responsive echoes in my  heart! It is a song of Fanchonette:          In vain, in vain; we meet no more,        Nor dream what fates befall;    And long upon the stranger's shore        My voice on thee may call,    When years have clothed the line in moss        That tells thy name and days,    And withered, on thy simple cross,        The wreaths of Pere la Chaise!        XVI    THE MALADY CALLED CATALOGITIS    Judge Methuen tells me that one of the most pleasing delusions he has  experienced in his long and active career as a bibliomaniac is that  which is born of the catalogue habit.  Presuming that there are among  my readers many laymen,--for I preach salvation to the heathen,--I will  explain for their information that the catalogue habit, so called, is a  practice to which the confirmed lover of books is likely to become  addicted.  It is a custom of many publishers and dealers to publish and  to disseminate at certain periods lists of their wares, in the hope of  thereby enticing readers to buy those wares.    By what means these crafty tradesmen secure the names of their  prospective victims I cannot say, but this I know full well--that there  seems not to be a book-lover on the face of the earth, I care not how  remote or how secret his habitation may be, that these dealers do not  presently find him out and overwhelm him with their delightful  temptations.    I have been told that among booksellers there exists a secret league  which provides for the interchange of confidences; so that when a new  customer enters a shop in the Fulham road or in Oxford street or along  the quays of Paris, or it matters not where (so long as the object of  his inquiry be a book), within the space of a month that man's name and  place of residence are reported to and entered in the address list of  every other bookseller in Christendom, and forthwith and forever after  the catalogues and price-lists and bulletins of publishers and dealers  in every part of the world are pelted at him through the unerring  processes of the mails.    Judge Methuen has been a victim (a pleasant victim) to the catalogue  habit for the last forty years, and he has declared that if all the  catalogues sent to and read by him in that space of time were gathered  together in a heap they would make a pile bigger than Pike's Peak, and  a thousandfold more interesting.  I myself have been a famous reader of  catalogues, and I can testify that the habit has possessed me of  remarkable delusions, the most conspicuous of which is that which  produces within me the conviction that a book is as good as mine as  soon as I have met with its title in a catalogue, and set an X over  against it in pencil.    I recall that on one occasion I was discussing with Judge Methuen and  Dr. O'Rell the attempted escapes of Charles I. from Carisbrooke Castle;  a point of difference having arisen, I said: \"Gentlemen, I will refer  to Hillier's 'Narrative,' and I doubt not that my argument will be  sustained by that authority.\"    It was vastly easier, however, to cite Hillier than it was to find him.  For three days I searched in my library, and tumbled my books about in  that confusion which results from undue eagerness; 't was all in vain;  neither hide nor hair of the desired volume could I discover.  It  finally occurred to me that I must have lent the book to somebody, and  then again I felt sure that it had been stolen.    No tidings of the missing volume came to me, and I had almost forgotten  the incident when one evening (it was fully two years after my  discussion with my cronies) I came upon, in one of the drawers of my  oak chest, a Sotheran catalogue of May, 1871.  By the merest chance I  opened it, and as luck would have it, I opened it at the very page upon  which appeared this item:    \"Hillier (G.) 'Narrative of the Attempted Escapes of Charles the First  from Carisbrooke Castle'; cr.  8vo, 1852, cloth, 3/6.\"    Against this item appeared a cross in my chirography, and I saw at a  glance that this was my long-lost Hillier! I had meant to buy it, and  had marked it for purchase; but with the determination and that  pencilled cross the transaction had ended. Yet, having resolved to buy  it had served me almost as effectively as though I had actually bought  it; I thought--aye, I could have sworn--I HAD bought it, simply because  I MEANT to buy it.    \"The experience is not unique,\" said Judge Methuen, when I narrated it  to him at our next meeting.  \"Speaking for myself, I can say that it is  a confirmed habit with me to mark certain items in catalogues which I  read, and then to go my way in the pleasing conviction that they are  actually mine.\"    \"I meet with cases of this character continually,\" said Dr. O'Rell.  \"The hallucination is one that is recognized as a specific one by  pathologists; its cure is quickest effected by means of hypnotism.  Within the last year a lady of beauty and refinement came to me in  serious distress.  She confided to me amid a copious effusion of tears  that her husband was upon the verge of insanity.  Her testimony was to  the effect that the unfortunate man believed himself to be possessed of  a large library, the fact being that the number of his books was  limited to three hundred or thereabouts.    \"Upon inquiry I learned that N. M. (for so I will call the victim of  this delusion) made a practice of reading and of marking booksellers'  catalogues; further investigation developed that N. M.'s great-uncle on  his mother's side had invented a flying-machine  that would not fly,  and that a half-brother of his was the author of a pamphlet entitled  '16 to 1; or the Poor Man's Vade-Mecum.'    \"'Madam,' said I, 'it is clear to me that your husband is afflicted  with catalogitis.'    \"At this the poor woman went into hysterics, bewailing that she should  have lived to see the object of her affection the victim of a malady so  grievous as to require a Greek name.  When she became calmer I  explained to her that the malady was by no means fatal, and that it  yielded readily to treatment.\"    \"What, in plain terms,\" asked Judge Methuen, \"is catalogitis?\"    \"I will explain briefly,\" answered the doctor.  \"You must know first  that every perfect human being is provided with two sets of bowels; he  has physical bowels and intellectual bowels, the brain being the  latter.  Hippocrates (since whose time the science of medicine has not  advanced even the two stadia, five parasangs of Xenophon)--Hippocrates,  I say, discovered that the brain is subject to those very same diseases  to which the other and inferior bowels are liable.    \"Galen confirmed this discovery and he records a case (Lib. xi., p.  318) wherein there were exhibited in the intellectual bowels symptoms  similar to those we find in appendicitis.  The brain is wrought into  certain convolutions, just as the alimentary canal is; the fourth  layer, so called, contains elongated groups of small cells or nuclei,  radiating at right angles to its plane, which groups present a  distinctly fanlike structure.  Catalogitis is a stoppage of this fourth  layer, whereby the functions of the fanlike structure are suffered no  longer to cool the brain, and whereby also continuity of thought is  interrupted, just as continuity of digestion is prevented by stoppage  of the vermiform appendix.    \"The learned Professor Biersteintrinken,\" continued Dr. O'Rell, \"has  advanced in his scholarly work on 'Raderinderkopf' the interesting  theory that catalogitis is produced by the presence in the brain of a  germ which has its origin in the cheap paper used by booksellers for  catalogue purposes, and this theory seems to have the approval of M.  Marie-Tonsard, the most famous of authorities on inebriety, in his  celebrated classic entitled 'Un Trait sur Jacques-Jacques.'\"    \"Did you effect a cure in the case of N. M.?\" I asked.    \"With the greatest of ease,\" answered the doctor.  \"By means of  hypnotism I purged his intellectuals of their hallucination, "]]]
