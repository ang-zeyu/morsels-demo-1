Let us be ready, for we may be sent for  any minute.\"    He put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zeb  got into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat.    \"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little.    \"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard.  \"It will all happen as quick as a  wink.\"    And that was the way it did happen.    The cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to  make sure he was not asleep.  For they were in the streets of a  beautiful emerald-green city, bathed in a grateful green light that was  especially pleasing to their eyes, and surrounded by merry faced people  in gorgeous green-and-gold costumes of many extraordinary designs.    Before them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and  now the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,  where splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their  silvery sprays into the air.    Zeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of  amazement, for the people were beginning to gather around and stare at  the strangers.    \"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into the  courtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the great  entrance of the royal palace.          15.  Old Friends are Reunited      Many servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome the  new arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl in  a green gown cried out in surprise:    \"Why, it's Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again!\"    The little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden's  hands in his and shook them cordially.    \"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it's little Jellia Jamb--as pert and  pretty as ever!\"    \"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low.  \"But I'm afraid you  cannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have a  beautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly.\"    \"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldier  in a Captain-General's uniform.    The Wizard turned to look at him.    \"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since  then I have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the Royal  Armies.\"    \"That's nice,\" said the little man.  \"But I assure you, my good people,  that I do not wish to rule the Emerald City,\" he added, earnestly.    \"In that case you are very welcome!\" cried all the servants, and it  pleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers  bowed before him.  His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz,  by any means.    \"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy and  stood beside his friend the little Wizard.    \"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"  replied Jellia Jamb.  \"But she has ordered me to make you welcome and  to show you to your apartments.\"    The boy looked around him with wondering eyes.  Such magnificence and  wealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever  dreamed of, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter  was real and not tinsel.    \"What's to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily.  He had seen  considerable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew that  this regal palace was no place for him.    It perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with the  animal.  The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so  unusual a creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who  lived in the Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so  after inspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes  the girl decided not to be afraid of him.    \"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have been  built since I went away.\"    \"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorse  lives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural in  appearance than this great beast you have brought with you.\"    \"Do you mean that I'm a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily.    \"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in the  place you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual.\"    This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden  decided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building  having many rooms that were seldom in use.    So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse  around to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he  could have all to himself.    Then Jellia said to the Wizard:    \"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been  vacant ever since you left us.  Would you like it again?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man.  \"It will seem like being at  home again, for I lived in that room for many, many years.\"    He knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his  satchel.  Zeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that  he almost feared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he  might dim their splendor.  In the closets he discovered many fancy  costumes of rich velvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told  him to dress himself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be  prepared to dine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour's time.    Opening from the chamber was a fine bathroom having a marble tub with  perfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of his  surroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet  costume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn  clothing.  There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with  diamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully  dressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in  his life.    He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence  of the Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more  dainty and attractive than it was splendid.  Here he found Dorothy  seated beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy  stopped suddenly with a gasp of admiration.    But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend's hand drawing him  impulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon  her guest.  Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the  boy's embarrassment.  The little man was clothed in black velvet, with  many sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald  head and wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.    Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the  Emerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkies  into one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner table  the Princess said:    \"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after this  great country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after  you.  It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because  you are of a strange race and my own name is Ozma.  No, one, I am sure,  is better able to explain this mystery than you.\"    \"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give me  pleasure to explain my connection with your country.  In the first  place, I must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was  a politician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle  Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could  think of no more to go before it.  Taken altogether, it was a  dreadfully long name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of  the hardest lessons I ever learned was to remember my own name.  When I  grew up I just called myself O. Z., because the other initials were  P-I-N-H-E-A-D; and that spelled 'pinhead,' which was a reflection on my  intelligence.\"    \"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,  sympathetically.  \"But didn't you cut it almost too short?\"    \"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard.  \"When a young man I ran away from  home and joined a circus.  I used to call myself a Wizard, and do  tricks of ventriloquism.\"    \"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess.    \"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that  the object was speaking instead of me.  Also I began to make balloon  ascensions.  On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the  circus I painted the two initials: 'O. Z.', to show that those things  belonged to me.    \"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts  to this beautiful country.  When the people saw me come from the sky  they naturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before  me.  I told them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that  amazed them; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they  called me Oz.\"    \"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling.    \"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup while  talking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one of  the four being ruled by a Witch.  But the people thought my power was  greater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought so  too, for they never dared oppose me.  I ordered the Emerald City to be  built just where the four countries cornered together, and when it was  completed I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz, which  included all the four countries of the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the  Winkies and the Quadlings."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#18)"],[1,"largely made are composed chiefly of material thus  worn from still more ancient lands--lands with their hills and  valleys like those of to-day--and carried by their rivers to the  ocean. In all geological times, as at the present, the work of  streams has been to destroy the lands, and in so doing to furnish  to the ocean the materials from which the lands of future ages  were to be made. Before we consider how the waste of the land  brought in by streams is rebuilt upon the ocean floor, we must  proceed to study the work of two agents, glacier ice and the wind,  which cooperate with rivers in the denudation of the land.            CHAPTER V    THE WORK OF GLACIERS      THE DRIFT. The surface of northeastern North America, as far south  as the Ohio and Missouri rivers, is generally covered by the  drift,--a formation which is quite unlike any which we have so far  studied. A section of it, such as that illustrated in Figure 87,  shows that for the most part it is unstratified, consisting of  clay, sand, pebbles, and even large bowlders, all mingled pell-  mell together. The agent which laid the drift is one which can  carry a load of material of all sizes, from the largest bowlder to  the finest clay, and deposit it without sorting.    The stones of the drift are of many kinds. The region from which  it was gathered may well have been large in order to supply these  many different varieties of rocks. Pebbles and bowlders have been  left far from their original homes, as may be seen in southern  Iowa, where the drift contains nuggets of copper brought from the  region about Lake Superior. The agent which laid the drift is one  able to gather its load over a large area and carry it a long way.    The pebbles of the drift are unlike those rounded by running water  or by waves. They are marked with scratches. Some are angular,  many have had their edges blunted, while others have been ground  flat and smooth on one or more sides, like gems which have been  faceted by being held firmly against the lapidary's wheel. In many  places the upper surface of the country rock beneath the drift has  been swept clean of residual clays and other waste. All rock  rotten has been planed away, and the ledges of sound rock to which  the surface has been cut down have been rubbed smooth and  scratched with long, straight, parallel lines. The agent which  laid the drift can hold sand and pebbles firmly in its grasp and  can grind them against the rock beneath, thus planing it down and  scoring it, while faceting the pebbles also.    Neither water nor wind can do these things. Indeed, nothing like  the drift is being formed by any process now at work anywhere in  the eastern United States. To find the agent which has laid this  extensive formation we must go to a region of different climatic  conditions.    THE INLAND ICE OF GREENLAND. Greenland is about fifteen hundred  miles long and nearly seven hundred miles in greatest width. With  the exception of a narrow fringe of mountainous coast land, it is  completely buried beneath a sheet of ice, in shape like a vast  white shield, whose convex surface rises to a height of nine  thousand feet above the sea. The few explorers who have crossed  the ice cap found it a trackless desert destitute of all life save  such lowly forms as the microscopic plant which produces the so-  called \"red snow.\" On the smooth plain of the interior no rock  waste relieves the snow's dazzling whiteness; no streams of  running water are seen; the silence is broken only by howling  storm winds and the rustle of the surface snow which they drive  before them. Sounding with long poles, explorers find that below  the powdery snow of the latest snowfall lie successive layers of  earlier snows, which grow more and more compact downward, and at  last have altered to impenetrable ice. The ice cap formed by the  accumulated snows of uncounted centuries may well be more than a  mile in depth. Ice thus formed by the compacting of snow is  distinguished when in motion as GLACIER ICE.    The inland ice of Greenland moves. It flows with imperceptible  slowness under its own weight, like, a mass of some viscous or  plastic substance, such as pitch or molasses candy, in all  directions outward toward the sea. Near the edge it has so thinned  that mountain peaks are laid bare, these islands in the sea of ice  being known as NUNATAKS. Down the valleys of the coastal belt it  drains in separate streams of ice, or GLACIERS. The largest of  these reach the sea at the head of inlets, and are therefore  called TIDE GLACIERS. Their fronts stand so deep in sea water that  there is visible seldom more than three hundred feet of the wall  of ice, which in many glaciers must be two thousand and more feet  high. From the sea walls of tide glaciers great fragments break  off and float away as icebergs. Thus snows which fell in the  interior of this northern land, perhaps many thousands of years  ago, are carried in the form of icebergs to melt at last in the  North Atlantic.    Greenland, then, is being modeled over the vast extent of its  interior not by streams of running water, as are regions in warm  and humid climates, nor by currents of air, as are deserts to a  large extent, but by a sheet of flowing ice. What the ice sheet is  doing in the interior we may infer from a study of the separate  glaciers into which it breaks at its edge.    THE SMALLER GREENLAND GLACIERS. Many of the smaller glaciers of  Greenland do not reach the sea, but deploy on plains of sand and  gravel. The edges of these ice tongues are often as abrupt as if  sliced away with a knife (Fig. 92), and their structure is thus  readily seen. They are stratified, their layers representing in  part the successive snowfalls of the interior of the country. The  upper layers are commonly white and free from stones; but the  lower layers, to the height of a hundred feet or more, are dark  with debris which is being slowly carried on. So thickly studded  with stones is the base of the ice that it is sometimes difficult  to distinguish it from the rock waste which has been slowly  dragged beneath the glacier or left about its edges. The waste  beneath and about the glacier is unsorted. The stones are of many  kinds, and numbers of them have been ground to flat faces. Where  the front of the ice has retreated the rock surface is seen to be  planed and scored in places by the stones frozen fast in the sole  of the glacier.    We have now found in glacier ice an agent able to produce the  drift of North America. The ice sheet of Greenland is now doing  what we have seen was done in the recent past in our own land. It  is carrying for long distances rocks of many kinds gathered, we  may infer, over a large extent of country. It is laying down its  load without assortment in unstratified deposits. It grinds down  and scores the rock over which it moves, and in the process many  of the pebbles of its load are themselves also ground smooth and  scratched. Since this work can be done by no other agent, we must  conclude that the northeastern part of our own continent was  covered in the recent past by glacier ice, as Greenland is to-day.    VALLEY GLACIERS    The work of glacier ice can be most conveniently studied in the  separate ice streams which creep down mountain valleys in many  regions such as Alaska, the western mountains of the United States  and Canada, the Himalayas, and the Alps. As the glaciers of the  Alps have been studied longer and more thoroughly than any others,  we shall describe them in some detail as examples of valley  glaciers in all parts of the world.    CONDITIONS OF GLACIER FORMATION. The condition of the great  accumulation of snow to which glaciers are due--that more or less  of each winter's snow should be left over unmelted and  unevaporated to the next--is fully met in the Alps. There is  abundant moisture brought by the winds from neighboring seas. The  currents of moist air driven up the mountain slopes are cooled by  their own expansion as they rise, and the moisture which they  contain is condensed at a temperature at or below 32 degrees F.,  and therefore is precipitated in the form of snow. The summers are  cool and their heat does not suffice to completely melt the heavy  snow of the preceding winter. On the Alps the SNOW LINE--the lower  limit of permanent snow--is drawn at about eight thousand five  hundred feet above sea level. Above the snow line on the slopes  and crests, where these are not too steep, the snow lies the year  round and gathers in valley heads to a depth of hundreds of feet.    This is but a small fraction of the thickness to which snow would  be piled on the Alps were it not constantly being drained away.  Below the snow fields which mantle the heights the mountain  valleys are occupied by glaciers which extend as much as a  vertical mile below the snow line. The presence in the midst of  forests and meadows and cultivated fields of these tongues of ice,  ever melting and yet from year to year losing none of their bulk,  proves that their loss is made good in the only possible way. They  are fed by snow fields above, whose surplus of snow they drain  away in the form of ice. The presence of glaciers below the snow  line is a clear proof that, rigid and motionless as they appear,  glaciers really are in constant motion down valley.    THE NEVE FIELD. The head of an Alpine valley occupied by a glacier  is commonly a broad amphitheater deeply filled with snow. Great  peaks tower above it, and snowy slopes rise on either side on the  flanks of mountain spurs. From these heights fierce winds drift  the snows into the amphitheater, and avalanches pour in their  torrents of snow and waste. The snow of the amphitheater is like  that of drifts in late winter after many successive thaws and  freezings. It is made of hard grains and pellets and is called  NEVE. Beneath the surface of the neve field and at its outlet the"]]]
