[243] In a legend of the Tibetan Buddhists, referred to by Professor  Schiefner in his interesting work, _Ueber Indra's Donnerkeil_ (St  Petersburg), 1848, we find two valiant heroes who, upon Mount  Gridhrakuta (the vulture's peak), strive, in presence of their master,  to lift the vagram (that is, the arm in the form of a wedge, the  lever-rod, the thunderbolt of Indras), but in vain; Vagrapanis alone  succeeds in lifting the vagram with his right hand. Ramas makes a  similar trial of strength in the _Ramayanam_, when he lifts and breaks  in pieces a bow, which no one had before been able even to move.    [244] Cfr. the following chapter.    [245] i. 2772-2783.    [246] To the myth of the ravished earrings is almost always joined, even  in the popular tales, the story of the horse, which is always especially  referred to the Acvinau, as that of the bull to Indras. In the Puranic  legends, Krishnas receives from the earth the earrings of Aditis (whom  we already know to be a cow), whilst he frees the princesses from the  infernal Narakas.--Cfr. the _Vishnu Purana_, v. 29.

[259] The word _badhiras_ means here the crooked, the crippled one,  and not the deaf (from the root _badh_ or _vadh_, to wound, to cut);  the more so that here the name of the blind man's companion is  Mantharakas, a word which properly means the slow one. The curved line  and the slow line correspond; and the curved one, who cannot stand  upright, may be the hunchback just as well as the cripple, the  crooked, the lame.--Cfr.

April 17--Turks capture Batum.      ITALIAN CAMPAIGN    March 22--Fighting becomes more active along the entire front; Italians  drive back patrols on the Trentino front and eject an Austrian  detachment from an advanced post in the Frenzela Valley sector.    March 28--Artillery engagements east of Badeneoche; forty Austrian  divisions transferred to the Italian front.      AERIAL RECORD    James Ian Macpherson, Parliamentary Secretary of the British War Office,  announced in the British Commons on March 19 that 255 flights into  Germany, constituting 38 raids, had been made since last October, and  that forty-eight tons of bombs had been dropped.    Italians bombed Metz on the nights of March 17 and March 23 and the  railway station at Thionville on March 24.    Paris was raided on the night of April 12 and twenty-six were persons  killed and seventy-two wounded.    Bombs were dropped on the east coast of England on the night of April  12. Five persons were killed and fifteen injured.      NAVAL RECORD    Ostend was bombarded by British monitors on March 21. On the same day  two German destroyers and two torpedo boats were sunk off Dunkirk by  British and French destroyers.    The Alexander Agassiz, a small boat formerly of American registry, which  was outfitted by the Germans at Mazatlan for service as a raider, was  captured in the Pacific Ocean by an American cruiser on March 19.

RUSSIA, RUMANIA, AND POLAND    Leon Trotzky asked the American military mission for ten American  officers to aid as inspectors in organizing and training a new volunteer  army, and requested the aid of American railway engineers and  transportation experts in the reorganization of the railways, March 20.  The same day he addressed the Moscow Soviet, calling for a new army of  from 300,000 to 750,000, commanded by trained officers.    Japanese and British marines were landed at Vladivostok on April 5,  following the invasion of a Japanese office by five armed Russians, who  killed one Japanese and wounded two others. The Siberian Council of  Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates protested to the Consular Corps, but  the Japanese representatives at Vologda explained that the landing was  only a local incident and that Admiral Kato had acted on his own  initiative.    The Trans-Caucasian Constituent Assembly, in session at Tiflis on March  21, refused to ratify the peace treaty with Germany, and urged immediate  war. On March 29 the Caucasus Diet approved the basis of a separate  peace agreement with Turkey, including autonomy for Armenia and the  restoration of old frontiers.    The Armenians and Georgians refused to recognize the cession of  territory made under the Brest-Litovsk treaty, and on April 3 fierce  fighting broke out in the districts of Batum, Kars, and Ardahan, as the  Turks began military occupation. The Georgians seized most of the  Russian warships in the Harbor of Batum and took them into the Black  Sea. On April 4 the Armenians recaptured Erzerum from the Turks, and on  April 7 the Turks took Ardahan from the Armenian forces.    Alexander Marghiloman, leader of the Conservatives, was appointed  Premier of Rumania March 20. On the same day Germany announced the  extension of the armistice until March 22.    On March 21 Germany increased her demands on Rumania, calling for the  surrender of all war munitions. Austria demanded the surrender of all  territory west of a line extending from a point east of Red Tower Pass  to a point on the Danube near Ghilramar, and also a strip of country  eighty miles long and ten miles wide in the region of Predeal. On March  23 Germany again extended the armistice because of a delay in the  formation of the Rumanian Cabinet. On March 29 Germany demanded that the  Rumanian oil wells be turned over to a German-controlled corporation.    German forces continued their advance in Ukraine, taking Kherson on  March 21 and burning Poltava on March 31. The Ukrainian Rada protested  against the German demand for 85 per cent. of the country's grain supply  and practically all of the sugar supply, March 27.

Finland protested to the German Government, March 29, against the arrest  of Major Henry Crosby Emery, representative of the Guaranty Trust  Company of New York, and his detention on the Aland Islands.    British and French troops were reported on March 31 to be co-operating  with the Bolshevist troops in the defense of the Kola and Mourmansk  troops against the Finnish White Guards. German troops were landed in  Finland April 3, and on the same day the Finnish White Guards captured  Tammerfors. The Russian fleet escaped from Helsingfors on April 7. On  April 8 Germany sent an ultimatum demanding the removal or disarmament  of all Russian warships in Finnish waters by April 12, and on April 11 a  German squadron, with several transports, arrived at Lovisa.    On April 14 German troops took Hyving and Finnish White Guards took  Bjoerneborg. Helsingfors was occupied by the Germans on April 15.    Abo was evacuated by the Red Guards on April 16.      MISCELLANEOUS    President Poincare refused to pardon Bolo Pacha, April 7, and the next  day the condemned man made a statement concerning other treason cases,  thus gaining a reprieve. He was executed on the morning of April 17.    Holland refused the Allies' terms for the transfer of Dutch ships and  demanded guarantees that they would not be used for troops or munitions.  On March 20 President Wilson issued a proclamation ordering their  seizure. The Netherlands Government protested in a statement which  appeared in the Official Gazette March 30. On April 1 President Wilson  issued an order authorizing the Navy Department to take possession of  all equipment and cargoes. Secretary Lansing replied to the Netherlands  Government in a statement issued on April 13.    Premier Lloyd George addressed the British House of Commons on April 9  on the military situation and the man-power problem. He asked that the  services of every able-bodied man between the ages of 18 and 50 be  placed at the disposal of the Government and advocated conscription in  Ireland. Leave to introduce the man-power bill was carried in the House.  The next day the second reading was carried, and on April 12 the bill  was passed. On the same day Sir Horace Plunkett submitted to Lloyd  George his report on the Irish Convention's plan for home rule. The  third reading of the man-power bill was passed by the House of Lords  April 17.    Mme. Despina Davidovitch Storch, a woman of Turkish birth; Baron Henri  de Beville, Mrs. Elizabeth Charlotte Nix, and a man who called himself  Count Robert de Clairmont were arrested in New York City on March 18 on  suspicion of being members of an international spy system working in the  interests of Germany. President Wilson ordered their deportation to  France. Mme. Storch died of pneumonia at Ellis Island on March 30.    Lieutenants Calamaras and Hodjopoulos, who landed in Greece from a  German submarine to act as agents of ex-King Constantine, and who  planned to arrange a spy system and establish a naval base, were  executed on March 30.    The Supreme War Council of the Allies issued a statement on March 18  condemning German political crimes against the Russian and Rumanian  peoples, refusing to acknowledge Germany's peace treaties with them, and  announcing their purpose to establish a reign of organized justice.    General Ferdinand Foch was made Generalissimo of all the allied forces  on the western front on March 28. A definite official announcement of  his appointment as Commander in Chief, with enlarged powers, was made on  April 15.          Russia Under German Domination    Record of a Month's Events The Russo-German peace treaty, signed by the  Bolshevist plenipotentiaries on March 3, 1918, and ratified at a session  of the All-Russian Soviet Congress held in Moscow on March 14-16, was  approved, after a prolonged discussion, by the Main Committee of the  German Reichstag on March 22.    Discussing the situation created in Russia by the Brest-Litovsk pact, a  Petrograd daily remarks that, while the rest of the world has secret  diplomacy and open war, Russia has open diplomacy and secret war. In  fact, the final ratification of the \"peace\" instrument by both sides did  not put an end to the military operations of the Central Powers in  Russia. Nor did the Russians cease to make feeble and sporadic attempts  at resistance.    In the third week of March the fall of Petrograd seemed imminent, but  the transfer of the Government to Moscow and the partial evacuation of  the northern capital by the civil population apparently changed the  objective of the invading German troops to the ancient Russian  metropolis. They began to march on Moscow from northwest, west, and  southwest, but stopped within the distance of approximately 150 miles  from that city. For the last three weeks practically no fighting has  been going on in the north of Russia, except occasional guerrilla  skirmishes and punitive expeditions, conducted by the Germans and the  propertied classes. On the other hand, in the south the Austro-German  invaders have been vigorously pushing on, ostensibly under the pretext  of assisting the friendly Ukrainian nation in its struggle against the  Soviet power.    By March 20 the Teutons were in possession of the whole of Western  Ukraine west of the Dnieper. Among other cities they held Zhitomir,  Kiev, Nikolayev, and Odessa. The latter city,"]]]
