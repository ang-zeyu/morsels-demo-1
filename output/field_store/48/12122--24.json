Let us picture wealth, then, as a mass held by a chemical force  in a permanent state of composition, in which new elements,  continually entering, combine in different proportions, but  according to a certain law: value is the proportional relation  (the measure) in which each of these elements forms a part of the  whole.    From this two things result: one, that the economists have been  wholly deluded when they have looked for the general measure of  value in wheat, specie, rent, etc., and also when, after having  demonstrated that this standard of measure was neither here nor  there, they have concluded that value has neither law nor  measure; the other, that the proportion of values may continually  vary without ceasing on that account to be subject to a law,  whose determination is precisely the solution sought.    This idea of value satisfies, as we shall see, all the  conditions: for it includes at once both the positive and fixed  element in useful value and the variable element in exchangeable  value; in the second place, it puts an end to the contradiction  which seemed an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the  determination of value; further, we shall show that value thus  understood differs entirely from a simple juxtaposition of the  two ideas of useful and exchangeable value, and that it is  endowed with new properties.    The proportionality of products is not a revelation that we  pretend to offer to the world, or a novelty that we bring into  science, any more than the division of labor was an unheard-of  thing when Adam Smith explained its marvels.  The proportionality  of products is, as we might prove easily by innumerable  quotations, a common idea running through the works on political  economy, but to which no one as yet has dreamed of attributing  its rightful importance: and this is the task which we undertake  today.  We feel bound, for the rest, to make this declaration in  order to reassure the reader concerning our pretensions to  originality, and to satisfy those minds whose timidity leads them  to look with little favor upon new ideas.    The economists seem always to have understood by the measure of  value only a standard, a sort of original unit, existing by  itself, and applicable to all sorts of merchandise, as the yard  is applicable to all lengths.  Consequently, many have thought  that such a standard is furnished by the precious metals.  But  the theory of money has proved that, far from being the measure  of values, specie is only their arithmetic, and a conventional  arithmetic at that.  Gold and silver are to value what the  thermometer is to heat.  The thermometer, with its arbitrarily  graduated scale, indicates clearly when there is a loss or an  increase of heat: but what the laws of heat-equilibrium are; what  is its proportion in various bodies; what amount is necessary to  cause a rise of ten, fifteen, or twenty degrees in the  thermometer,--the thermometer does not tell us; it is not certain  even that the degrees of the scale, equal to each other,  correspond to equal additions of heat.    The idea that has been entertained hitherto of the measure of  value, then, is inexact; the object of our inquiry is not the  standard of value, as has been said so often and so foolishly,  but the law which regulates the proportions of the various  products to the social wealth; for upon the knowledge of this law  depends the rise and fall of prices in so far as it is normal and  legitimate.  In a word, as we understand by the measure of  celestial bodies the relation resulting from the comparison of  these bodies with each other, so, by the measure of values, we  must understand the relation which results from their comparison.    Now, I say that this relation has its law, and this comparison  its principle.    I suppose, then, a force which combines in certain proportions  the elements of wealth, and makes of them a homogeneous whole: if  the constituent elements do not exist in the desired proportion,  the combination will take place nevertheless; but, instead of  absorbing all the material, it will reject a portion as useless.  The internal movement by which the combination is produced, and  which the affinities of the various substances determine--this  movement in society is exchange; exchange considered no longer  simply in its elementary form and between man and man, but  exchange considered as the fusion of all values produced by  private industry in one and the same mass of social wealth.  Finally, the proportion in which each element enters into the  compound is what we call value; the excess remaining after the  combination is NON-VALUE, until the addition of a certain  quantity of other elements causes further combination and  exchange.    We will explain later the function of money.    This determined, it is conceivable that at a given moment the  proportions of values constituting the wealth of a country may be  determined, or at least empirically approximated, by means of  statistics and inventories, in nearly the same way that the  chemists have discovered by experience, aided by analysis, the  proportions of hydrogen and oxygen necessary to the formation of  water.  There is nothing objectionable in this method of  determining values; it is, after all, only a matter of accounts.  But such a work, however interesting it might be, would teach us  nothing very useful.  On the one hand, indeed, we know that the  proportion continually varies; on the other, it is clear that  from a statement of the public wealth giving the proportions of  values only for the time and place when and where the statistics  should be gathered we could not deduce the law of proportionality  of wealth.  For that, a single operation of this sort would not  be sufficient; thousands and millions of similar ones would be  necessary, even admitting the method to be worthy of confidence.    Now, here there is a difference between economic science and  chemistry.  The chemists, who have discovered by experience such  beautiful proportions, know no more of their how or why than of  the force which governs them.  Social economy, on the contrary,  to which no a posteriori investigation could reveal directly the  law of proportionality of values, can grasp it in the very force  which produces it, and which it is time to announce.    This force, which Adam Smith has glorified so eloquently, and  which his successors have misconceived (making privilege its  equal),--this force is LABOR.  Labor differs in quantity and  quality with the producer; in this respect it is like all the  great principles of Nature and the most general laws, simple in  their action and formula, but infinitely modified by a multitude  of special causes, and manifesting themselves under an  innumerable variety of forms.  It is labor, labor alone, that  produces all the elements of wealth, and that combines them to  their last molecules according to a law of variable, but certain,  proportionality.  It is labor, in fine, that, as the principle of  life, agitates (mens agitat) the material (molem) of wealth, and  proportions it.    Society, or the collective man, produces an infinitude of  objects, the enjoyment of which constitutes its WELL-BEING.  This well-being is developed not only in the ratio of the  QUANTITY of the products, but also in the ratio of their  VARIETY (quality) and PROPORTION.  From this fundamental datum  it follows that society always, at each instant of its life, must  strive for such proportion in its products as will give the  greatest amount of well-being, considering the power and means of  production.  Abundance, variety, and proportion in products are  the three factors which constitute WEALTH: wealth, the object of  social economy, is subject to the same conditions of existence as  beauty, the object of art; virtue, the object of morality; and  truth, the object of metaphysics.    But how establish this marvelous proportion, so essential that  without it a portion of human labor is lost,--that is, useless,  inharmonious, untrue, and consequently synonymous with poverty  and annihilation?    Prometheus, according to the fable, is the symbol of human  activity.  Prometheus steals the fire of heaven, and invents the  early arts; Prometheus foresees the future, and aspires to  equality with Jupiter; Prometheus is God.  Then let us call  society Prometheus.    Prometheus devotes, on an average, ten hours a day to labor,  seven to rest, and seven to pleasure.  In order to gather from  his toil the most useful fruit, Prometheus notes the time and  trouble that each object of his consumption costs him.  Only  experience can teach him this, and this experience lasts  throughout his life.  While laboring and producing, then,  Prometheus is subject to an infinitude of disappointments.  But,  as a final result, the more he labors, the greater is his  well-being and the more idealized his luxury; the further he  extends his conquests over Nature, the more strongly he fortifies  within him the principle of life and intelligence in the exercise  of which he alone finds happiness; till finally, the early  education of the Laborer completed and order introduced into his  occupations, to labor, with him, is no longer to suffer,--it is  to live, to enjoy.  But the attractiveness of labor does not  nullify the rule, since, on the contrary, it is the fruit of it;  and those who, under the pretext that labor should be attractive,  reason to the denial of justice and to communism, resemble  children who, after having gathered some flowers in the garden,  should arrange a flower-bed on the staircase.    In society, then, justice is simply the proportionality of  values; its guarantee and sanction is the responsibility of the  producer.

An  account of his efforts to bring to justice the Mountain Meadow and other  murderers has already been given in his own language.    The following notice of this bold and energetic man is from the \"Nevada  Territorial Enterprise\":--         \"Judge Cradlebaugh, of the United States Court of Utah, is       making his mark in that Territory, if half that is written of       him is true. . . . . Satisfied that many of the leading       Mormons had taken part in or instigated the Mountain Meadow       massacre, and the murder of Jones, Potter, Forbes, Parrish,       and a dozen others, he determined to bring them to punishment.       . . . He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution       of a Jackson; but the jury failed to indict, or even report on       the charges, while threats of violence were heard in every       quarter, and an attack on the troops intimated, if he       persisted in his course.         \"Finding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were       discharged, with a scathing rebuke from the Judge. Sitting as       a committing magistrate, he commenced his task alone. He       examined witnesses, made arrests in every quarter, and created       a consternation in the camps of the saints, greater even than       was occasioned by the arrival of the troops within the walls       of Zion. At last accounts, terrified elders and bishops were       decamping to save their necks; and developments of the most       startling character were being made, implicating the highest       church dignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed       upon the gentiles during the past eight years.\"    Governor Cumming did not sustain Judge Cradlebaugh, but, under the  pretence of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands  of justice.    Hence various differences between Cumming on one side, and Johnson and  Cradlebaugh on the other; and on one occasion the Governor went so far  as to publish his protest against the use of the troops in aid of  Cradlebaugh's proceedings.    Cumming was a native of Georgia. He had married a daughter of one of the  most distinguished physicians of Boston, a lady of many accomplishments,  who accompanied him to Utah.    During the dreadful reign of the cholera in 1836 he was Mayor of  Augusta, Ga., and is said to have rendered efficient service in saving  the lives of the citizens.    For some years he was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. At the  commencement of the Mexican war he was at Point Isabel, and afterwards  on the Southern line, attached to General Scott's staff. Subsequently he  was detailed by the Government to visit several tribes of Indians in the  far West.    He had performed some service to the country, and was a man of many good  qualities; but was very vain, and fond of attention, and was unable to  withstand the seductive influences which the Mormons know so well how to  bring to bear upon persons of his organization.    Cradlebaugh, finding he was not supported by Buchanan's administration,  left Utah, and settled in the Territory of Nevada; whence he has been  twice sent as delegate to Congress, and we look to see him, at no  distant day, represent the new State of Nevada in the Senate of the  United States.    In 1860 John F. Kinney was reappointed Chief Justice, succeeding Judge  Eckels; and Judges Crosby and Flenniken were appointed Associate  Justices, to succeed Sinclair and Cradlebaugh. Judge Cradlebaugh did not  resign, and not recognizing the right of the President to remove the  Judges, he continued to perform the duties of his office for some time  afterward.    On the 3d of October, 1861, John W. Dawson, of Indiana, was appointed by  President Lincoln as Governor of Utah, to succeed Cumming, who had left the  Territory some months previous.    In the appointment of Dawson, Lincoln, to use his own language, was  \"imposed on.\" The Senate relieved him from the imposition, by refusing  to confirm the appointment.    The Mormons, however, anticipated the action of the Senate, and speedily  ejected Dawson from the governorship. The history of this _emeute_ is  briefly as follows:--    Dawson arrived at Salt Lake about the commencement of the session of the  Legislature. Having some notions of his own concerning legislative  affairs, and not yielding, like his predecessor, to all the views of  Brigham Young, he soon became involved in difficulties from which he was  unable to extricate himself. He had not the nerve and ability to sustain  himself in his position. The Mormons saw this, and at once resolved  upon, planned, and accomplished a brilliant _coup d'etat_, similar to  that practised upon Steptoe. Without going into details, the plan may be  seen by the result; which was the affidavit of a widow woman named  Williams, to the effect that Dawson had insulted her, by making improper  advances, which, of course, she had scornfully repelled and rejected.    The indignation of the Mormons was aroused to the highest pitch by this  base attempt upon Mormon virtue. Threats were made so freely, that the  Governor became very much alarmed, and precipitately fled the  Territory. Not satisfied with this, the \"boys\" waylaid him at one of the  stations, and gave him a severe beating.    In contemplating this serio-comic affair, one hardly knows which most to  condemn, the lawless spirit which prompted such treatment, or the  timidity and weakness which would submit to it.    About the 1st of February, 1862, Judges Flenniken and Crosby left Salt  Lake City, and the federal officers there immediately advised the  President of the fact by telegraph, and recommended the appointment of  their successors. Accordingly on the 3d of February, 1862, Thomas J.  Drave, of Michigan, and Charles B. Waite, of Illinois, were appointed  Associate Justices, and on the 31st of March following, Stephen S.  Harding, of Indiana, was appointed Governor, to succeed Dawson.      FOOTNOTES:    [69:A] John D. Lee is an adopted son of Brigham Young.    [71:A] Several years after the massacre, Major, now General Carlton,  visited that region and erected a monument to the memory of the slain.  \"It was constructed by raising a large pile of rock, in the centre of  which was erected a beam, some twelve or fifteen feet in height. Upon  one of the stones he caused to be engraved, 'Here lie the bones of one  hundred and twenty men, women, and children, from Arkansas, murdered  on the 10th day of September, 1857.' Upon a cross-tree, on the beam,  he caused to be painted: 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I  will repay it.' This monument is said to have been destroyed the first  time Brigham visited that part of the Territory.\"          CHAPTER VI.    POLITICAL HISTORY CONTINUED.         Arrival of the New Federal Officers in July, 1862.--Colonel       Connor arrives with his Command.--The Message of Gov. Harding.       --The Mormons Indignant.--The Legislature refuse to print the       Message.--Action of the United States Senate thereon.--Forgery       in the Mormon Legislature.--Bill of Judge Waite to amend the       Organic Act.--Indignation Meeting.--Governor Harding and       Judges Waite and Drake requested to leave the Territory.--       Their Replies.--Brigham.--The Federal Officers.      Judges Drake and Waite arrived in Salt Lake City on the 11th of July,  1862. Governor Harding had arrived a few days previous.    For several months everything passed off smoothly, and Brigham was more  than once heard to say the officers now in the Territory were \"good  men.\" No circumstances occurred to develop any differences, and it was  hoped by the federal officers themselves that none would arise.    In the mean time, in October of the same year, Colonel (now General)  Connor marched into and through Salt Lake City with his command, and  established his camp on the \"bench,\" or high land, about three miles  east of the city. His forces at that time consisted of the Third  Regiment of Infantry, California Volunteers, and the Second Regiment of  Cavalry, under command of Col. George S. Evans.    Some little excitement was caused by the entrance of the troops, and  rumors were rife of threats having been made by the Mormons that the  volunteers should never \"cross the Jordan,\" a stream a few miles south  of the city, and which was directly on their line of march. But the  Jordan was crossed, the camp established, and everything went on as  usual, until the meeting of the Territorial Legislature in December.    Then the pent-up fires began to break forth. The first pretext used by  the Mormons for indulging in words and acts of hostility was the Message  of Governor Harding to the Legislature. Therein he called the attention  of the people, through their representatives, to the practice of  polygamy in their midst, to the anomalous state of society it tended to  establish, to its incompatibility with our free institutions, and  especially to its violation of an Act of Congress recently passed.    The following are the portions of the Message which gave most offence:--           \"_Polygamy._         \"It would be disingenuous if I were not to advert to a       question which, although seemingly it has nothing to do in the       premises, yet is one of vast importance to you as a people,       and which cannot be ignored. I mean that institution which is       not only commended but encouraged by you, and which, to say       the least of it, is an anomaly throughout Christendom. I mean       polygamy, or, if you prefer the term, plurality of wives. In       approaching this delicate subject, I desire to do so in no  "]]]
