[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#18)"],[1,"telephoning of the instructions about the  papers took some time. Tom had counted on this, and had made his  plans accordingly.    As soon as the telephone call had come in, Tom had communicated  with a private detective who was in waiting, and this man had gone  to the drug store whence the first call had come. He was going to  try to make the arrest of the man telephoning.    But for fear the scoundrel would go to a different instrument, Tom  took another precaution. This was to have one of the operators in  the central exchange on the watch. As soon as Mrs. Damon's house  was in connection with another telephone, the location of the  latter would be noted, and another private detective would be sent  there. Thus Tom hoped to catch the man at the 'phone.    Meanwhile Tom listened to the hoarse voice at the other end of the  wire, giving the directions to Mrs. Damon. Tom hoped that soon  there would be an arrest made.    Meanwhile the talk was being faithfully recorded on the phonograph  cylinder. And, as the man talked on, Tom became aware of a curious  undercurrent of sound. It was a buzzing noise, that Tom knew did  not come from the instrument itself. It was not the peculiar  tapping, singing noise heard in a telephone receiver, caused by  induced electrical currents, or by wire trouble.    \"This is certainly different,\" mused Tom. He was trying to recall  where he had heard the noise before. Sometimes it was faint, and  then it would gradually increase, droning off into faintness once  more. Occasionally it was so loud that Mrs. Damon could not hear  the talk about the papers, and the man would have to repeat.    But finally he came to an end.    \"This is all now,\" he said, sharply. Tom heard the words above the  queer, buzzing, humming sound. \"You are keeping me too long. I  think you are up to some game, but it won't do you any good, Mrs.  Damon. I'll 'phone you to-morrow where to send the papers. And if  you don't send them--if you try any tricks--it will be the worse  for you and Mr. Damon!\"    There was a click, that told of a receiver being placed back on  the hook, and the voice ceased. So, also, did the queer, buzzing  sound over which Tom puzzled.    \"What can it have been?\" he asked. \"Did you hear it, Mrs. Damon?\"    \"What, Tom?\"    \"That buzzing sound.\"    \"Yes, I heard, but I didn't know what it was. Oh, Tom, what shall  I do?\"    \"Don't worry. We'll see if anything happened. They may have caught  that fellow. If not I'll plan another scheme.\"    Tom's first act was to call up the telephone exchange to learn  where the second call had come from. He got the information at  once. The address was in the suburbs. The man had not gone to the  drug store this time.    \"Did the detective get out to that address?\" asked Tom eagerly of  the manager.    \"Yes. As soon as we were certain that he was the party you wanted,  your man got right after him, Mr. Swift.\"    \"That's good, I hope he catches him!\" cried the young inventor. \"We'll  have to wait and find out.\"    \"He said he'd call up and let you know as soon as he reached the  place,\" the telephone manager informed Tom.    There was nothing to do but wait, and meanwhile Tom did what he  could to comfort Mrs. Damon. She was quite nervous and inclined to  be hysterical, and the youth thought it wise to have a cousin, who  had come to stay with her, summon the doctor.    \"But, Tom, what shall I do about those papers?\" Mrs. Damon asked  him. \"Shall I send them?\"    \"Indeed not!\"    \"But I want Mr. Damon restored to me,\" she pleaded. \"I don't care  about the money. He can make more.\"    \"Well, we'll not give those scoundrels the satisfaction of getting  any money out of you. Just wait now, I'll work this thing out, and  find a way to catch that fellow. If I could only think what that  buzzing sound was--\"    Then, in a flash, it came to Tom.    \"A sawmill! A planing mill!\" he cried. \"That's what it was! That  fellow was telephoning from some place near a sawmill!\"    The telephone rang in the midst of Tom's excited comments.    \"Yes--yes!\" he called eagerly. \"Who is it--what is it?\"    \"This is Larsen--the private detective you sent.\"    \"Oh, yes, you were at the drug store.\"    \"Yes, Mr. Swift. Well, that party didn't call up from here.\"    \"I know, Larsen. It was from another station. We're after him.  Much obliged to you. Come on back.\"    Tom was sure his theory was right. The man had called up the Damon  house from some telephone near a sawmill. And a little later Tom's  theory was proved to be true. He got a report from the second  detective. Unfortunately the man had not been able to reach the  telephone station before the unknown speaker had departed.    \"Was the place near a sawmill?\" asked Tom, eagerly.    \"It was,\" answered the detective over the wire. \"The telephone is  right next door to one. It's an automatic pay station and no one  seems to have noticed who the man was who telephoned. I couldn't  get a single clue. I'm sorry.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Tom, as cheerfully as he could. \"I think I'm on  the right track now. I'm going to lay a trap for this fellow.\"            CHAPTER XX    SETTING THE TRAP      Troublesome problems seemed to be multiplying for Tom Swift. He  admitted as much himself after the failure to capture the man who  had telephoned to Mrs. Damon. He had hoped that his plan of  sending detectives to the location of the telephones would  succeed. Since it had not the youth must try other means.    \"Now, Ned,\" he said to his chum, when they were on their way from  Mrs. Damon's, it being impossible to do anything further there.  \"Now, Ned, we've got to think this thing out together.\"    \"I'm willing, Tom. I'll do what I can.\"    \"I know you will. Now the thing to do is to go at this thing  systematically. Otherwise we'll be working around in a circle, and  won't get anywhere. In the first place, let's set down what we do  know. Then we'll put down what we don't know, and go after that.\"    \"Put down what you don't know?\" exclaimed Ned. \"How are you going  to put down a thing when you don't know it?\"    \"I mean we can put a question mark after it, so to speak. For  instance we don't know where Mr. Damon is, but we want to find  out.\"    \"Oh, I see. Well, let's start off with the things we do know.\"    The two friends were at Tom's house by now, having come from  Waterford in Tom's airship. After thinking over all the exciting  happenings of the past few days, Tom remarked: \"Now, Ned, for the  things we do know. In the first place Mr. Damon is missing, and  his fortune is about gone. There is considerable left to Mrs.  Damon, however, but those scoundrels may get that away from her,  if we don't watch out. Secondly, my airship was taken and brought  back, with a button more than it had when it went away. Said  button exactly matched one off Mr. Boylan's coat.\"    \"Thirdly, Mr. Damon was either taken away or went away, in an  airship--either in mine or someone else's. Fourthly, Mrs. Damon  has received telephonic communications from the man, or men, who  have her husband. Fifthly, Mr. Peters, either legally or  illegally, is responsible for the loss of Mr. Damon's fortune.  Now: there you are--for the things we do know.\"    \"Now for the things we don't know. We don't know who has taken  Mr. Damon away, nor where he is, to begin with the most important.\"    \"Hold on, Tom, I think you're wrong,\" broke in Ned.    \"In what way?\"    \"About not knowing who is responsible for the taking away of Mr.  Damon. I think it's as plain as the nose on your face that Peters  is responsible.\"    \"I can't see it that way,\" said Tom, quickly. \"I will admit that  it looks as though Boylan had been in my airship, but as for  Peters taking Mr. Damon away--why, Peters is around town all the  while, and if he had a hand in the disappearance of Mr. Damon, do  you think he'd stay here, when he knows we are working on the  case? And would he send Boylan to see me if Boylan had been one of  those who had a hand in it? They wouldn't dare, especially as they  know I'm working on the case.\"    \"Peters is a bad lot. I'll grant you, though, he was fair enough  to pay for my motor boat. I don't believe he had anything to do  with taking Mr. Damon away.\"    \"Do you think he was the person who was talking to Mrs. Damon  about the papers?\"    \"No, Ned. I don't. I listened to that fellow's voice carefully. It  wasn't like Peters's. I'm going to put it in the phonograph, too,  and let you listen to it. Then see what you say.\"    Tom did this, a little later. The record of the voice, as it came  over the wire, was listened to from the wax cylinder, and Ned had  to admit that it was not much like that of the promoter.    \"Well, what's next to be done?\" asked the young banker.    \"I'm going to set a trap,\" replied Tom, with a grin.    \"Set a trap?\"    \"Yes, a sort of mouse-trap. I'm glad my photo telephone is now  perfected, Ned.\"    \"What has that got to do with it?\"    \"That's going to be my trap, Ned. Here is my game. You know this  fellow--this strange unknown--is going to call up Mrs. Damon  to-morrow. Well, I'll be ready for him. I'm going to put in the booth  where he will telephone from, one of my photo telephones--that is, the  sending apparatus. In Mrs. Damon's house, attached to her telephone,  will be the receiving plate, as well as the phonograph cylinder.\"    \"When this fellow starts to talk he'll be sending us his picture,  though he won't know it, and we'll be getting a record of his  voice. Then we'll have him just where we want him.\"    \"Good!\" cried Ned. \"But, Tom, there's a weak spot in your mouse-trap.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"How are you going to know which telephone the unknown will call  up from? He may go to any of a hundred, more or less.\"    \"He might--yes. But that's a chance we've got to take. It isn't so  much of a chance, though when you stop to think that he will  probably go to some public telephone in an isolated spot, and,  unless I'm "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#18)"],[1,"    [53] Pepwell has \"feble.\"    [54] Reasons.

Pepwell has  instead: \"To the which us bring our blessed Benjamin, Christ Jesu,  Amen.\" Harl. MS. 1022 ends: \"Jesus Jesu, Mercy, Jesu, grant Mercy,  Jesu.\" The whole of this concluding paragraph, which is an addition  of the translator, differs considerably in Pepwell.    [118]So Pepwell and MS. Reg. 17 D.V.; Caxton has: \"Thou art she that  art not, and I am he that am\"; which is nearer to the Latin.    [119]Caxton reads: \"I escape gracyously all his snares.\"    [120]Cf. Dante, Par. xxxiii. 100-105:--      \"A quella luce cotal si diventa,    Che volgersi da lei per altro aspetto,    E impossibil che mai si consenta;    Pero che il ben, ch'e del volere obbietto,    Tutto s'accoglie in lei, e fuor di quella    E difettivo cio che li e perfetto.\"    \"Such at that light does one become, that it were impossible ever  to consent to turn from it for sight of ought else, For the good,  that is the object of the will, is wholly gathered therein, and  outside it that is defective which there is perfect.\"    [121]So Pepwell: Caxton has: \"yf thou wilt gete the vertu of  ghostely strength.\"    [122]Pepwell and the MS. add: \"and temptations\" (Caxton: \"of  temptacyons\"); which is clearly out of place. Cf. Legenda, SS 104  (Acta Sanctorum, Aprilis, tom. iii.).    [123]2 Cor. i. 7.    [124]Mated. Caxton has: \"vertuously y-mette.\" Cf. Legenda, SS 101:  \"Talis anima sic Deo conjuncta.\"    [125]2 Cor. xii. 10.    [126] \"And the cause and the rote\" (Caxton).    [127]Sometimes.    [128]Caxton has: \"It happed she sayde that other whyle deuoute  feruour of a sowle leuyng oure lorde Jhesu other by somme certeyne  synne, or ellys by newe sotyll temptacyons of the fende wexyth dull  and slowe, and other whyle it is y-brought to veray coldenesse.\"  Pepwell and the MS. are entirely corrupt: \"It happeneth (she sayth)  that otherwhyle a synner whiche is leuynge our Lord Jhesu by some  certeyn synne, or ellys by some certeyn temptacyons of the fende,\"  &c. The original of the passage runs thus: \"Frequenter enim (ut  inquiebat) contingit animae Deum amanti quod fervor mentalis, vel ex  divina providentia, vel ex aliquali culpa, vel ex haustis  adinventionibus inimici, tepescit, et quandoque quasi ad  frigiditatem usque deducitur\" (Legenda SS 107).    [129]So Caxton; Pepwell has: \"leaving.\"    [130]Caxton has: \"seeth\"; the Latin text: quantumcumque videat seu  sentiat.    [131]Requited.    [132]So the MS.; Pepwell reads: \"were feble and fayle\"; and Caxton:  \"wexed feble and defayled.\"    [133]Caxton reads: \"prayng\" (praying).    [134]So Caxton: Pepwell and MS. have: \"in.\"    [135]Latin, Praelatorum suorum (i.e. of her ecclesiastical  superiors), Legenda, SS 361.    [136]Omitted in Pepwell and in MS.    [137]Judge. Cf. above, p. 14.    [138]Judgment.

Skeat, SS 97): \"Thanne shaltow  understonde, that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or techinge, by  word or by wrytinge, or in ensample. Also in weringe of heyres or of  stamin, or of haubergeons on hir naked flesh, for Cristes sake, and  swiche manere penances. But war thee wel that swiche manere penances  on thy flesh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of  thy-self; for bettre is to caste awey thyn heyre, than for to caste  away the sikernesse of Jesu Crist. And therfore seith seint Paul:  'Clothe yow, as they that been chosen of God, in herte of  misericorde, debonairetee, suffraunce, and swich manere of  clothinge'; of whiche Jesu Crist is more apayed than of heyres, or  haubergeons, or hauberkes.\"    [141]Wynkyn de Worde has: \"sholde.\"    [142]Wynkyn de Worde has: \"profyte.\"    [143]Cf. St. Catherine of Siena, Letter to William Flete (ed. Gigli,  124): \"There are some who give themselves perfectly to chastising  their body, doing very great and bitter penance, in order that the  sensuality may not rebel against the reason. They have set all their  desire more in mortifying the body than in slaying their own will.  These are fed at the table of penance, and are good and perfect, but  unless they have great humility, and compel themselves to consider  the will of God and not that of men, they oft times mar their  perfection by making themselves judges of those who are not going by  the same way that they are going.\"    [144]Perhaps, simply, \"say many prayers\"--without any special  reference to the rosary.    [145]Annoy.    [146]Wynkyn de Worde has: \"mote.\"    [147]Wynkyn de Worde has: \"lownesse.\"    [148]With-out-forth=outwardly. Cf. Chaucer, The Persones Tale, (ed.  Skeat, SS 10): \"And with-inne the hertes of folk shal be the bytinge  conscience, and with-oute-forth shal be the world al brenninge.\"    [149]Everyche=each one.    [150]According to the legend, certain \"indulgences,\" to be gained by  all who visited the Holy Places at Jerusalem, were first granted by  Pope St. Sylvester at the petition of Constantine and St. Helena.  There seems no evidence as to the real date at which these special  indulgences were instituted. Cf. Amort, De origine, progressu,  valore, ac frauctu Indulgentiarum, Augsburg, 1735, pars i. pp. 217  et seq.    [151]Plenary.    [152]All the indulgences attached to the Holy Places.    [153]Probably Racheness in the parish of South Acre, where \"there  was a leper hospital, with church or chapel dedicated to St.  Bartholomew, of early foundation\" (Victoria History of the County of  Norfolk, ii. p. 450).    [154]In true union.    [155]Established firmly.    [156]Wandering.    [157]So Horstman. Pepwell reads: \"With this wonderful onehede ne may  none be fuifilled.\"    [158]Unreasonable impulses.    [159]Secret nature. Cf. Mother Juliana, Revelations of Divine Love,  xiv. cap. 46: \"And our kindly substance is now blessedfully in God.\"    [160]Divers.    [161]Cf.
