There can be no doubt that every peculiarity  of his personal appearance is thoroughly well known to the writer of  the letter.\"    \"Even a cough that he is troubled with is mentioned, if I remember  right?\"    \"Yes, and mentioned correctly.  He treats it lightly himself, though it  sometimes makes his friends anxious about him.\"    \"I suppose no whispers have ever been heard against his character?\"    \"Mr. Hartright! I hope you are not unjust enough to let that infamous  letter influence you?\"    I felt the blood rush into my cheeks, for I knew that it HAD influenced  me.    \"I hope not,\" I answered confusedly.  \"Perhaps I had no right to ask  the question.\"    \"I am not sorry you asked it,\" she said, \"for it enables me to do  justice to Sir Percival's reputation.  Not a whisper, Mr. Hartright,  has ever reached me, or my family, against him.  He has fought  successfully two contested elections, and has come out of the ordeal  unscathed.  A man who can do that, in England, is a man whose character  is established.\"    I opened the door for her in silence, and followed her out.  She had  not convinced me.  If the recording angel had come down from heaven to  confirm her, and had opened his book to my mortal eyes, the recording  angel would not have convinced me.    We found the gardener at work as usual.  No amount of questioning could  extract a single answer of any importance from the lad's impenetrable  stupidity.  The woman who had given him the letter was an elderly  woman; she had not spoken a word to him, and she had gone away towards  the south in a great hurry.  That was all the gardener could tell us.    The village lay southward of the house.  So to the village we went next.        XII    Our inquiries at Limmeridge were patiently pursued in all directions,  and among all sorts and conditions of people.  But nothing came of  them.  Three of the villagers did certainly assure us that they had  seen the woman, but as they were quite unable to describe her, and  quite incapable of agreeing about the exact direction in which she was  proceeding when they last saw her, these three bright exceptions to the  general rule of total ignorance afforded no more real assistance to us  than the mass of their unhelpful and unobservant neighbours.    The course of our useless investigations brought us, in time, to the  end of the village at which the schools established by Mrs. Fairlie  were situated.  As we passed the side of the building appropriated to  the use of the boys, I suggested the propriety of making a last inquiry  of the schoolmaster, whom we might presume to be, in virtue of his  office, the most intelligent man in the place.    \"I am afraid the schoolmaster must have been occupied with his  scholars,\" said Miss Halcombe, \"just at the time when the woman passed  through the village and returned again.  However, we can but try.\"    We entered the playground enclosure, and walked by the schoolroom  window to get round to the door, which was situated at the back of the  building.  I stopped for a moment at the window and looked in.    The schoolmaster was sitting at his high desk, with his back to me,  apparently haranguing the pupils, who were all gathered together in  front of him, with one exception.  The one exception was a sturdy  white-headed boy, standing apart from all the rest on a stool in a  corner--a forlorn little Crusoe, isolated in his own desert island of  solitary penal disgrace.    The door, when we got round to it, was ajar, and the school-master's  voice reached us plainly, as we both stopped for a minute under the  porch.    \"Now, boys,\" said the voice, \"mind what I tell you.  If I hear another  word spoken about ghosts in this school, it will be the worse for all  of you.  There are no such things as ghosts, and therefore any boy who  believes in ghosts believes in what can't possibly be; and a boy who  belongs to Limmeridge School, and believes in what can't possibly be,  sets up his back against reason and discipline, and must be punished  accordingly.  You all see Jacob Postlethwaite standing up on the stool  there in disgrace.  He has been punished, not because he said he saw a  ghost last night, but because he is too impudent and too obstinate to  listen to reason, and because he persists in saying he saw the ghost  after I have told him that no such thing can possibly be. If nothing  else will do, I mean to cane the ghost out of Jacob Postlethwaite, and  if the thing spreads among any of the rest of you, I mean to go a step  farther, and cane the ghost out of the whole school.\"    \"We seem to have chosen an awkward moment for our visit,\" said Miss  Halcombe, pushing open the door at the end of the schoolmaster's  address, and leading the way in.    Our appearance produced a strong sensation among the boys.  They  appeared to think that we had arrived for the express purpose of seeing  Jacob Postlethwaite caned.    \"Go home all of you to dinner,\" said the schoolmaster, \"except Jacob.  Jacob must stop where he is; and the ghost may bring him his dinner, if  the ghost pleases.\"    Jacob's fortitude deserted him at the double disappearance of his  schoolfellows and his prospect of dinner.  He took his hands out of his  pockets, looked hard at his knuckles, raised them with great  deliberation to his eyes, and when they got there, ground them round  and round slowly, accompanying the action by short spasms of sniffing,  which followed each other at regular intervals--the nasal minute guns  of juvenile distress.    \"We came here to ask you a question, Mr. Dempster,\" said Miss Halcombe,  addressing the schoolmaster; \"and we little expected to find you  occupied in exorcising a ghost.  What does it all mean? What has really  happened?\"    \"That wicked boy has been frightening the whole school, Miss Halcombe,  by declaring that he saw a ghost yesterday evening,\" answered the  master; \"and he still persists in his absurd story, in spite of all  that I can say to him.\"    \"Most extraordinary,\" said Miss Halcombe, \"I should not have thought it  possible that any of the boys had imagination enough to see a ghost.  This is a new accession indeed to the hard labour of forming the  youthful mind at Limmeridge, and I heartily wish you well through it,  Mr. Dempster.  In the meantime, let me explain why you see me here, and  what it is I want.\"    She then put the same question to the schoolmaster which we had asked  already of almost every one else in the village.  It was met by the  same discouraging answer Mr. Dempster had not set eyes on the stranger  of whom we were in search.    \"We may as well return to the house, Mr. Hartright,\" said Miss  Halcombe; \"the information we want is evidently not to be found.\"    She had bowed to Mr. Dempster, and was about to leave the schoolroom,  when the forlorn position of Jacob Postlethwaite, piteously sniffing on  the stool of penitence, attracted her attention as she passed him, and  made her stop good-humouredly to speak a word to the little prisoner  before she opened the door.    \"You foolish boy,\" she said, \"why don't you beg Mr. Dempster's pardon,  and hold your tongue about the ghost?\"    \"Eh!--but I saw t' ghaist,\" persisted Jacob Postlethwaite, with a stare  of terror and a burst of tears.    \"Stuff and nonsense! You saw nothing of the kind.  Ghost indeed! What  ghost----\"    \"I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe,\" interposed the schoolmaster a  little uneasily--\"but I think you had better not question the boy. The  obstinate folly of his story is beyond all belief; and you might lead  him into ignorantly----\"    \"Ignorantly what?\" inquired Miss Halcombe sharply.    \"Ignorantly shocking your feelings,\" said Mr. Dempster, looking very  much discomposed.    \"Upon my word, Mr. Dempster, you pay my feelings a great compliment in  thinking them weak enough to be shocked by such an urchin as that!\" She  turned with an air of satirical defiance to little Jacob, and began to  question him directly.  \"Come!\" she said, \"I mean to know all about  this.  You naughty boy, when did you see the ghost?\"    \"Yestere'en, at the gloaming,\" replied Jacob.    \"Oh! you saw it yesterday evening, in the twilight? And what was it  like?\"    \"Arl in white--as a ghaist should be,\" answered the ghost-seer, with a  confidence beyond his years.    \"And where was it?\"    \"Away yander, in t' kirkyard--where a ghaist ought to be.\"    \"As a 'ghaist' should be--where a 'ghaist' ought to be--why, you little  fool, you talk as if the manners and customs of ghosts had been  familiar to you from your infancy! You have got your story at your  fingers' ends, at any rate.  I suppose I shall hear next that you can  actually tell me whose ghost it was?\"    \"Eh! but I just can,\" replied Jacob, nodding his head with an air of  gloomy triumph.    Mr. Dempster had already tried several times to speak while Miss  Halcombe was examining his pupil, and he now interposed resolutely  enough to make himself heard.    \"Excuse me, Miss Halcombe,\" he said, \"if I venture to say that you are  only encouraging the boy by asking him these questions.\"    \"I will merely ask one more, Mr. Dempster, and then I shall be quite  satisfied.  Well,\" she continued, turning to the boy, \"and whose ghost  was it?\"    \"T' ghaist of Mistress Fairlie,\" answered Jacob in a whisper.    The effect which this extraordinary reply produced on Miss Halcombe  fully justified the anxiety which the schoolmaster had shown to prevent  her from hearing it.  Her face crimsoned with indignation--she turned  upon little Jacob with an angry suddenness which terrified him into a  fresh burst of tears--opened her lips to speak to him--then controlled  herself, and addressed the master"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#18)"],[1," if those  Fallaba engines could have been sent to Chatham dockyard, would  mention that \"you could not get any pace up on her\"; and all who  knew her sadly owned \"she wouldn't steer,\" so naturally she spent  the greater part of her time on the Ogowe on a sand-bank, or in the  bush.  All West African steamers have a mania for bush, and the  delusion that they are required to climb trees.  The Fallaba had the  complaint severely, because of her defective steering powers, and  the temptation the magnificent forest, and the rapid currents, and  the sharp turns of the creek district, offered her; she failed, of  course--they all fail--but it is not for want of practice.  I have  seen many West Coast vessels up trees, but never more than fifteen  feet or so.    The trade of this lower part of the Ogowe, from the mouth to  Lembarene, a matter of 130 miles, is almost nil.  Above Lembarene,  you are in touch with the rubber and ivory trade.    This Fallaba creek is noted for mosquitoes, and the black passengers  made great and showy preparations in the evening time to receive  their onslaught, by tying up their strong chintz mosquito bars to  the stanchions and the cook-house.  Their arrangements being  constantly interrupted by the white engineer making alarums and  excursions amongst them; because when too many of them get on one  side the Move takes a list and burns her boilers.  Conversation and  atmosphere are full of mosquitoes.  The decision of widely  experienced sufferers amongst us is, that next to the lower Ogowe,  New Orleans is the worst place for them in this world.    The day closed with a magnificent dramatic beauty.  Dead ahead of  us, up through a bank of dun-coloured mist rose the moon, a great  orb of crimson, spreading down the oil-like, still river, a streak  of blood-red reflection.  Right astern, the sun sank down into the  mist, a vaster orb of crimson, and when he had gone out of view,  sent up flushes of amethyst, gold, carmine and serpent-green, before  he left the moon in undisputed possession of the black purple sky.    Forest and river were absolutely silent, but there was a pleasant  chatter and laughter from the black crew and passengers away  forward, that made the Move seem an island of life in a land of  death.  I retired into my cabin, so as to get under the mosquito  curtains to write; and one by one I heard my companions come into  the saloon adjacent, and say to the watchman:  \"You sabe six  o'clock?  When them long arm catch them place, and them short arm  catch them place, you call me in the morning time.\"  Exit from  saloon--silence--then:  \"You sabe five o'clock?  When them long arm  catch them place, and them short arm catch them place, you call me  in the morning time.\"  Exit--silence--then:  \"You sabe half-past  five o'clock?  When them long arm--\"  Oh, if I were a watchman!  Anyhow, that five o'clocker will have the whole ship's company  roused in the morning time.    June 7th.--Every one called in the morning time by the reflex row  from the rousing of the five o'clocker.  Glorious morning.  The  scene the reversal of that of last night.  The forest to the east  shows a deep blue-purple, mounted on a background that changes as  you watch it from daffodil and amethyst to rose-pink, as the sun  comes up through the night mists.  The moon sinks down among them,  her pale face flushing crimson as she goes; and the yellow-gold  sunshine comes, glorifying the forest and gilding the great sweep of  tufted papyrus growing alongside the bank; and the mist vanishes,  little white flecks of it lingering among the water reeds and lying  in the dark shadows of the forest stems.  The air is full of the  long, soft, rich notes of the plantain warblers, and the uproar  consequent upon the Move taking on fuel wood, which comes alongside  in canoe loads from the Fallaba.    Pere Steinitz and Mr. Woods are busy preparing their respective  canoes for their run to Fernan Vaz through the creek.  Their canoes  are very fine ones, with a remarkably clean run aft.  The Pere's is  quite the travelling canoe, with a little stage of bamboo aft,  covered with a hood of palm thatch, under which you can make  yourself quite comfortable, and keep yourself and your possessions  dry, unless something desperate comes on in the way of rain.    By 10.25 we have got all our wood aboard, and run off up river full  speed.  The river seems broader above the Fallaba, but this is  mainly on account of its being temporarily unencumbered with  islands.  A good deal of the bank we have passed by since leaving  Nazareth Bay on the south side has been island shore, with a channel  between the islands and the true south bank.    The day soon grew dull, and looked threatening, after the delusive  manner of the dry season.  The climbing plants are finer here than I  have ever before seen them.  They form great veils and curtains  between and over the trees, often hanging so straight and flat, in  stretches of twenty to forty feet or so wide, and thirty to sixty or  seventy feet high, that it seems incredible that no human hand has  trained or clipped them into their perfect forms.  Sometimes these  curtains are decorated with large bell-shaped, bright-coloured  flowers, sometimes with delicate sprays of white blossoms.  This  forest is beyond all my expectations of tropical luxuriance and  beauty, and it is a thing of another world to the forest of the  Upper Calabar, which, beautiful as it is, is a sad dowdy to this.  There you certainly get a great sense of grimness and vastness; here  you have an equal grimness and vastness with the addition of superb  colour.  This forest is a Cleopatra to which Calabar is but a  Quaker.  Not only does this forest depend on flowers for its  illumination, for there are many kinds of trees having their young  shoots, crimson, brown-pink, and creamy yellow:  added to this there  is also the relieving aspect of the prevailing fashion among West  African trees, of wearing the trunk white with here and there upon  it splashes of pale pink lichen, and vermilion-red fungus, which  alone is sufficient to prevent the great mass of vegetation from  being a monotony in green.    All day long we steam past ever-varying scenes of loveliness whose  component parts are ever the same, yet the effect ever different.  Doubtless it is wrong to call it a symphony, yet I know no other  word to describe the scenery of the Ogowe.  It is as full of life  and beauty and passion as any symphony Beethoven ever wrote:  the  parts changing, interweaving, and returning.  There are leit motifs  here in it, too.  See the papyrus ahead; and you know when you get  abreast of it you will find the great forest sweeping away in a bay-  like curve behind it against the dull gray sky, the splendid columns  of its cotton and red woods looking like a facade of some limitless  inchoate temple.  Then again there is that stretch of sword-grass,  looking as if it grew firmly on to the bottom, so steady does it  stand; but as the Move goes by, her wash sets it undulating in waves  across its broad acres of extent, showing it is only riding at  anchor; and you know after a grass patch you will soon see a red  dwarf clay cliff, with a village perched on its top, and the  inhabitants thereof in their blue and red cloths standing by to  shout and wave to the Move, or legging it like lamp-lighters from  the back streets and the plantation to the river frontage, to be in  time to do so, and through all these changing phases there is always  the strain of the vast wild forest, and the swift, deep, silent  river.    At almost every village that we pass--and they are frequent after  the Fallaba--there is an ostentatious display of firewood deposited  either on the bank, or on piles driven into the mud in front of it,  mutely saying in their uncivilised way, \"Try our noted chunks:  best  value for money\"--(that is to say, tobacco, etc.), to the Move or  any other little steamer that may happen to come along hungry for  fuel.    We stayed a few minutes this afternoon at Ashchyouka, where there  came off to us in a canoe an enterprising young Frenchman who has  planted and tended a coffee plantation in this out-of-the-way  region, and which is now, I am glad to hear, just coming into  bearing.  After leaving Ashchyouka, high land showed to the N.E.,  and at 5.15, without evident cause to the uninitiated, the Move took  to whistling like a liner.  A few minutes later a factory shows up  on the hilly north bank, which is Woermann's; then just beyond and  behind it we see the Government Post; then Hatton and Cookson's  factory, all in a line.  Opposite Hatton and Cookson's there was a  pretty little stern-wheel steamer nestling against the steep clay  bank of Lembarene Island when we come in sight, but she instantly  swept out from it in a perfect curve, which lay behind her marked in  frosted silver on the water as she dropt down river.  I hear now she  was the Eclaireur, the stern-wheeler which runs up and down the  Ogowe in connection with the Chargeurs Reunis Company, subsidised by  the Government, and when the Move whistled, she was just completing  taking on 3,000 billets of wood for fuel.  She comes up from the  Cape (Lopez) stoking half wood and half coal as far as Njole and  back to Lembarene; from Lembarene to the sea downwards she does on  wood.  In a few minutes we have taken her berth close to the bank,  and tied up to a tree.  The white engineer yells to the black  engineer \"Tom-Tom:  Haul out some of them fire and open them drains  one time,\" and the stokers, with hooks, pull out the glowing logs on  to the iron deck in front of the furnace door, and throw water over  them, and the Move sends a cloud of oil-laden steam against the  bank, coming perilously near scalding some of her black admirers  assembled there.  I dare say she felt vicious because they had been  admiring the Eclaireur.    After a few minutes, I am escorted"]]]
