Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major   exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.   Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total   exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices   can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for   increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in   international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered   from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD   countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly   from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor   being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so   strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and   monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,   largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.   A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of   Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months   through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to   boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to   government statistics.     National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $374.6 billion (1994   est.)     National product real growth rate: 6.4% (1994)     National product per capita: $20,720 (1994 est.)     Inflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1994)     Unemployment rate: 8.9% (December 1994)     Budget:   revenues: $83.8 billion   expenditures: $92.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA   (FY93/94)     Exports: $50.4 billion (1994)   commodities: coal, gold, meat, wool, alumina, wheat, machinery and   transport equipment   partners: Japan 25%, US 11%, South Korea 6%, NZ 5.7%, UK, Taiwan,   Singapore, Hong Kong (1992)     Imports: $51.1 billion (1994)   commodities: machinery and transport equipment, computers and office   machines, crude oil and petroleum products   partners: US 23%, Japan 18%, UK 6%, Germany 5.7%, NZ 4% (1992)     External debt: $147.2 billion (1994)     Industrial production: growth rate 3.9% (FY93/94); accounts for 32% of   GDP     Electricity:   capacity: 34,540,000 kW   production: 155 billion kWh   consumption per capita: 8,021 kWh (1993)     Industries: mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food   processing, chemicals, steel     Agriculture: accounts for 5% of GDP and over 30% of export revenues;   world's largest exporter of beef and wool, second-largest for mutton,   and among top wheat exporters; major crops - wheat, barley, sugarcane,   fruit; livestock - cattle, sheep, poultry    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5747"],[0,"Do and Dare — a Brave Boy's Fight for Fortune (#18)"],[1,"Herbert.    \"Well, in the morning when I went out I found seven dead redskins, and  two others lying at the point of death.\"    \"That was certainly a thrilling adventure, Colonel,\" said George  Melville, smiling.    \"Egad, I should say so.\"    \"I confess I don't care to meet with any such.\"    \"Oh, no danger, no danger!\" said the colonel, airily. \"That is,  comparatively speaking. In fact, the chief danger is of a different  sort.\"    \"Of the sleigh upsetting and tipping us out into some of the canyons, I  suppose you mean?\"    \"No, I speak of the gentlemen of the road--road agents as they are  generally called.\"    \"You mean highwaymen?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is there much danger of meeting them?\" asked Melville.    \"Well, there's a chance. They are quite in the habit of attacking  stage-coaches, and plundering the passengers. Sometimes they make rich  hauls.\"    \"That must be rather inconvenient to the passengers.\" said Melville.  \"Can't the laws reach these outlaws?\"    \"They don't seem to. Why, there are men who have been in the business  for years, and have never been caught.\"    \"Very true,\" said a fellow traveler. \"There's Jerry Lane, for instance.  He has succeeded thus far in eluding the vigilance of the authorities.\"    \"Yes,\" said the colonel, \"I once saw Lane myself. Indeed he did me the  honor of relieving me of five hundred dollars.\"    \"Couldn't you help it?\" asked Herbert.    \"No; he covered me with his revolver, and if I had drawn mine I  shouldn't have lived to take aim at him.\"    \"Were you in a stage at the time?\"    \"No, I was riding on horseback.\"    \"Is this Lane a large man?\" asked George Melville.    \"Not larger than myself,\" continued the colonel.    \"Where does he live--in some secret haunt in the forest, I suppose?\"    \"Oh, no, he doesn't confine himself to one place. He travels a good  deal. Sometimes he goes to St. Louis. I have heard that he sometimes  even visits New York.\"    \"And is he not recognized?\"    \"No; he looks like anything but an outlaw. If you should see him you  might think him a prosperous merchant, or banker.\"    \"That's curious!\" said Herbert.    \"The fact is,\" said the colonel, \"when you travel by stage-coaches  in these solitudes you have to take the chances. Now I carry my money  concealed in an inner pocket, where it isn't very likely to be found. Of  course I have another wallet, just for show, and I give that up when I  have to.\"    There was a stout, florid gentleman present, who listened to the  above conversation with ill-disguised nervousness. He was a New York  capitalist, of German birth, going out to inspect a mine in which he  proposed purchasing an interest. His name was Conrad Stiefel.    \"Good gracious!\" said he, \"I had no idea a man ran such a risk, or I  would have stayed at home. I decidedly object to being robbed.\"    \"Men are robbed in a different way in New York,\" said George Melville.    \"How do you mean, Mr. Melville?\"    \"By defaulting clerks, absconding cashiers, swindlers of excellent  social position.\"    \"Oh, we don't mind those things,\" said Mr. Stiefel. \"We can look out  for ourselves. But when a man points at you with a revolver, that is  terrible!\"    \"I hope, my dear sir, you take good care of your money.\"    \"That I do,\" said Stiefel, complacently. \"I carry it in a belt around my  waist. That's a good place, hey?\"    \"I commend your prudence, sir,\" said the colonel. \"You are evidently a  wise and judicious man.\"    \"They won't think of looking there, hey?\" laughed Stiefel.    \"I should say not.\"    \"You may think what you like, Mr. Stiefel,\" said a tall, thin passenger,  who looked like a book peddler, \"but I contend that my money is in a  safer place than yours.\"    \"Indeed, Mr. Parker, I should like to know where you keep it,\" said Col.  Warner, pleasantly.    \"You can't get at it without taking off my stockings,\" said the tall  man, looking about him in a self-satisfied manner.    \"Very good, 'pon my soul!\" said the colonel. \"I really don't know but I  shall adopt your hiding place. I am an old traveler, but not too old to  adopt new ideas when I meet with good ones.\"    \"I think you would find it to your interest, Colonel,\" said Parker,  looking flattered.    \"Well, well,\" said the colonel, genially, \"suppose we change the  subject. There isn't much chance of our being called upon to produce our  money, or part with it. Still, as I said a while since, it's best to  be cautious, and I see that you all are so. I begin to feel hungry,  gentlemen. How is it with you?\"    \"Are we anywhere near the place for supper?\" asked Stiefel. \"I wish I  could step into a good Broadway restaurant; I feel empty.\"    \"Only a mile hence, gentlemen, we shall reach Echo Gulch, where we halt  for the night. There's a rude cabin there, where they will provide us  with supper and shelter.\"    This announcement gave general satisfaction. The colonel proved to be  right. The stage soon drew up in front of a long one-story building,  which bore the pretentious name of the Echo Gulch Hotel.          CHAPTER XXIII. A STARTLING REVELATION.        A stout, black-bearded man stood in front of the hotel to welcome  the stage passengers. He took a clay pipe from his lips and nodded a  welcome.    \"Glad to see you, strangers,\" he said. \"Here, Peter, you black rascal,  help the gentlemen with their baggage.\"    The door was thrown open, and the party filed into a comfortless looking  apartment, at one end of which was a rude bar.    One of the passengers, at least, seemed to know the landlord, for Col.  Warner advanced to greet him, his face beaming with cordiality.    \"How are you, John?\" he said. \"How does the world use you?\"    The landlord growled something inaudible.    \"Have a drink, colonel?\" was the first audible remark.    \"Don't care if I do. It's confounded dry traveling over these mountain  roads. Walk up, gentlemen. Col. Warner doesn't drink alone.\"    With the exception of Herbert and George Melville, the passengers seemed  inclined to accept the offer.    \"Come along, Melville,\" said the colonel; \"you and your friend must join  us.\"    \"Please excuse me, colonel,\" answered Melville. \"I would prefer not to  drink.\"    \"Oh, nonsense! To oblige me, now.\"    \"Thank you; but I am traveling for my health, and it would not be  prudent.\"    \"Just as you say, Melville; but a little whisky would warm you up and do  you good, in my opinion.\"    \"Thank you all the same, colonel; but I think you must count me out.\"    The colonel shrugged his shoulders and beckoned Herbert.    \"You can come, anyway; your health won't prevent.\"    Melville did not interfere, for he knew it would give offense, but he  hoped his young clerk would refuse.    \"Thank you,\" said Herbert; \"I won't object to a glass of sarsaparilla.\"    \"Sarsaparilla!\" repeated the colonel, in amazement. \"What's that?\"    \"We don't keep no medicine,\" growled the landlord.    \"Have you root-beer?\" asked Herbert.    \"What do you take me for?\" said the landlord, contemptuously. \"I haven't  got no root-beer. Whisky's good enough for any man.\"    \"I hope you'll excuse me, then,\" said Herbert. \"I am not used to any  strong drinks.\"    \"How old are you?\" asked the colonel, rather contemptuously.    \"Sixteen.\"    \"Sixteen years old and don't drink whisky! My young friend, your  education has been sadly neglected.\"    \"I dare say it has,\" answered Herbert, good-naturedly.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Col. Warner, apologetically, \"the boy is a stranger,  and isn't used to our free Western ways. He's got the makings of a man  in him, and it won't be long before he'll get over his squeamishness,  and walk up to the bar as quick as any one of us.\"    Herbert and Melville stood apart, while the rest of the company emptied  their glasses, apparently at a gulp. It was clear that their refusal had  caused them to be regarded with dislike and suspicion.    The accommodations of the Echo Gulch Hotel were far from luxurious. The  chambers were scarcely larger than a small closet, clap-boarded but not  plastered, and merely contained a bedstead. Washing accommodations were  provided downstairs.    Herbert and George Melville were assigned to a single room, to which  they would not have objected had the room been larger. It was of no use  to indulge in open complaints, however, since others had to fare in the  same way.    \"This isn't luxury, Herbert,\" said Melville.    \"No,\" answered the boy; \"but I don't mind it if you don't.\"    \"I am afraid I may keep you awake by my coughing, Herbert.\"    \"Not if I once get to sleep. I sleep as sound as a top.\"    \"I wish I did; but I am one of the wakeful kind. Being an invalid, I  am more easily annoyed by small inconveniences. You, with your sturdy  health, are more easily suited.\"    \"Mr. Melville, I had just as lief sleep downstairs in a chair, and give  you the whole of the bed.\"    \"Not on my account, Herbert. I congratulate myself on having you for a  roommate. If I had been traveling alone I might have been packed away  with the colonel, who, by this time, would be even less desirable as a  bedfellow than usual.\"    The worthy colonel had not been content with a single glass of whisky,  but had followed it up several times, till his utterance had become  thick, and his face glowed with a dull, brick-dust color.    Col. Warner had been assigned to the adjoining chamber, or closet,  whichever it may be called. He did not retire early, however, while  Herbert and George Melville did.    Strangely enough, Herbert, who was usually so good a sleeper, after  a short nap woke up. He turned to look at his companion, for it was a  moonlight night, and saw that he was sleeping quietly.    \"I wonder what's got into me?\" he thought; \"I thought I should sleep  till morning.\"    He tried to compose himself to sleep, but the more effort he made the  broader awake he became. Sometimes it seems as if such unaccountable  deviations from our ordinary habits were Heaven-sent. As Herbert lay  awake he"]]]
