Fritz made him a new pair of trousers  and would have made him an overcoat but for the fact that overcoats were  so easy to pawn.    Wunsch would not go across the ravine to the town until he went to take  the morning train for Denver. He said that after he got to Denver he  would \"look around.\" He left Moonstone one bright October morning,  without telling any one good-bye. He bought his ticket and went directly  into the smoking-car. When the train was beginning to pull out, he heard  his name called frantically, and looking out of the window he saw Thea  Kronborg standing on the siding, bareheaded and panting. Some boys had  brought word to school that they saw Wunsch's trunk going over to the  station, and Thea had run away from school. She was at the end of the  station platform, her hair in two braids, her blue gingham dress wet to  the knees because she had run across lots through the weeds. It had  rained during the night, and the tall sunflowers behind her were fresh  and shining.    \"Good-bye, Herr Wunsch, good-bye!\" she called waving to him.    He thrust his head out at the car window and called back, \"LEBEN SIE  WOHL, LEBEN SIE WOHL, MEIN KIND!\" He watched her until the train swept  around the curve beyond the roundhouse, and then sank back into his  seat, muttering, \"She had been running. Ah, she will run a long way;  they cannot stop her!\"    What was it about the child that one believed in? Was it her dogged  industry, so unusual in this free-and-easy country? Was it her  imagination? More likely it was because she had both imagination and a  stubborn will, curiously balancing and interpenetrating each other.  There was something unconscious and unawakened about her, that tempted  curiosity. She had a kind of seriousness that he had not met with in a  pupil before. She hated difficult things, and yet she could never pass  one by. They seemed to challenge her; she had no peace until she  mastered them. She had the power to make a great effort, to lift a  weight heavier than herself. Wunsch hoped he would always remember her  as she stood by the track, looking up at him; her broad eager face, so  fair in color, with its high cheek-bones, yellow eyebrows and  greenishhazel eyes. It was a face full of light and energy, of the  unquestioning hopefulness of first youth. Yes, she was like a flower  full of sun, but not the soft German flowers of his childhood. He had it  now, the comparison he had absently reached for before: she was like the  yellow prickly pear blossoms that open there in the desert; thornier and  sturdier than the maiden flowers he remembered; not so sweet, but  wonderful.      That night Mrs. Kohler brushed away many a tear as she got supper and  set the table for two. When they sat down, Fritz was more silent than  usual. People who have lived long together need a third at table: they  know each other's thoughts so well that they have nothing left to say.  Mrs. Kohler stirred and stirred her coffee and clattered the spoon, but  she had no heart for her supper. She felt, for the first time in years,  that she was tired of her own cooking. She looked across the glass lamp  at her husband and asked him if the butcher liked his new overcoat, and  whether he had got the shoulders right in a ready-made suit he was  patching over for Ray Kennedy. After supper Fritz offered to wipe the  dishes for her, but she told him to go about his business, and not to  act as if she were sick or getting helpless.    When her work in the kitchen was all done, she went out to cover the  oleanders against frost, and to take a last look at her chickens. As she  came back from the hen-house she stopped by one of the linden trees and  stood resting her hand on the trunk. He would never come back, the poor  man; she knew that. He would drift on from new town to new town, from  catastrophe to catastrophe. He would hardly find a good home for himself  again. He would die at last in some rough place, and be buried in the  desert or on the wild prairie, far enough from any linden tree!    Fritz, smoking his pipe on the kitchen doorstep, watched his Paulina and  guessed her thoughts. He, too, was sorry to lose his friend. But Fritz  was getting old; he had lived a long while and had learned to lose  without struggle.          XIV    \"Mother,\" said Peter Kronborg to his wife one morning about two weeks  after Wunsch's departure, \"how would you like to drive out to Copper  Hole with me to-day?\"    Mrs. Kronborg said she thought she would enjoy the drive. She put on her  gray cashmere dress and gold watch and chain, as befitted a minister's  wife, and while her husband was dressing she packed a black oilcloth  satchel with such clothing as she and Thor would need overnight.    Copper Hole was a settlement fifteen miles northwest of Moonstone where  Mr. Kronborg preached every Friday evening. There was a big spring there  and a creek and a few irrigating ditches. It was a community of  discouraged agriculturists who had disastrously experimented with dry  farming. Mr. Kronborg always drove out one day and back the next,  spending the night with one of his parishioners. Often, when the weather  was fine, his wife accompanied him. To-day they set out from home after  the midday meal, leaving Tillie in charge of the house. Mrs. Kronborg's  maternal feeling was always garnered up in the baby, whoever the baby  happened to be. If she had the baby with her, the others could look out  for themselves. Thor, of course, was not, accurately speaking, a baby  any longer. In the matter of nourishment he was quite independent of his  mother, though this independence had not been won without a struggle.  Thor was conservative in all things, and the whole family had anguished  with him when he was being weaned. Being the youngest, he was still the  baby for Mrs. Kronborg, though he was nearly four years old and sat up  boldly on her lap this afternoon, holding on to the ends of the lines  and shouting \"'mup, 'mup, horsey.\" His father watched him affectionately  and hummed hymn tunes in the jovial way that was sometimes such a trial  to Thea.    Mrs. Kronborg was enjoying the sunshine and the brilliant sky and all  the faintly marked features of the dazzling, monotonous landscape. She  had a rather unusual capacity for getting the flavor of places and of  people. Although she was so enmeshed in family cares most of the time,  she could emerge serene when she was away from them. For a mother of  seven, she had a singularly unprejudiced point of view. She was,  moreover, a fatalist, and as she did not attempt to direct things beyond  her control, she found a good deal of time to enjoy the ways of man and  nature.    When they were well upon their road, out where the first lean pasture  lands began and the sand grass made a faint showing between the  sagebrushes, Mr. Kronborg dropped his tune and turned to his wife.  \"Mother, I've been thinking about something.\"    \"I guessed you had. What is it?\" She shifted Thor to her left knee,  where he would be more out of the way.    \"Well, it's about Thea. Mr. Follansbee came to my study at the church  the other day and said they would like to have their two girls take  lessons of Thea. Then I sounded Miss Meyers\" (Miss Meyers was the  organist in Mr. Kronborg's church) \"and she said there was a good deal  of talk about whether Thea wouldn't take over Wunsch's pupils. She said  if Thea stopped school she wouldn't wonder if she could get pretty much  all Wunsch's class. People think Thea knows about all Wunsch could  teach.\"    Mrs. Kronborg looked thoughtful. \"Do you think we ought to take her out  of school so young?\"    \"She is young, but next year would be her last year anyway. She's far  along for her age. And she can't learn much under the principal we've  got now, can she?\"    \"No, I'm afraid she can't,\" his wife admitted. \"She frets a good deal  and says that man always has to look in the back of the book for the  answers. She hates all that diagramming they have to do, and I think  myself it's a waste of time.\"    Mr. Kronborg settled himself back into the seat and slowed the mare to a  walk. \"You see, it occurs to me that we might raise Thea's prices, so it  would be worth her while. Seventy-five cents for hour lessons, fifty  cents for half-hour lessons. If she got, say two thirds of Wunsch's  class, that would bring her in upwards of ten dollars a week. Better pay  than teaching a country school, and there would be more work in vacation  than in winter. Steady work twelve months in the year; that's an  advantage. And she'd be living at home, with no expenses.\"    \"There'd be talk if you raised her prices,\" said Mrs. Kronborg  dubiously.    \"At first there would. But Thea is so much the best musician in town  that they'd all come into line after a while. A good many people in  Moonstone have been making money lately, and have bought new pianos.  There were ten new pianos shipped in here from Denver in the last year.  People ain't going to let them stand idle; too much money invested. I  believe Thea can have as many scholars as she can handle, if we set her  up a little.\"    \"How set her up, do you mean?\" Mrs. Kronborg felt a certain reluctance  about accepting this plan, though she had not yet had time to think out  her reasons.    \"Well, I've been thinking for some time we could make good use of  another room. We couldn't give up the parlor to her all the time. If we  built another room on the ell and put the piano in there, she could give  lessons all day long and it wouldn't bother us. We could build a  clothes-press in it, and put in a bed-lounge and a dresser and let Anna  have it for her sleeping-room. She needs a place of her own, now that  she's beginning to be dressy.\"    \"Seems like Thea ought to have the choice of the room, herself,\" said  Mrs. Kronborg.    \"But, my dear, she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#18)"],[1," giddy babble of a  conqueror.  O Galeazzo! hast triumphed o'er thyself indeed--casting that  old familiar? chasing him hereout?  Why, then, I whom thou hast  appointed to be thy conscience, interpreting thy rule through truth and  love, am the more emboldened to beseech the favour for which I came.'    'Ask it only, sweet.'  His chest still heaved spasmodically to the  catching of his breath.    'It is,' said the boy steadily, 'that thou wouldst give me, thy  conscience's delegate, a last justification by the sacraments.'    The Duke smiled faintly, and nodded, and murmured: 'I will confess ere  midnight, and, fasting, receive the Holy Communion before I go  to-morrow.  Does it please thee?  Come, then.'    He re-entered his cabinet, reeling a little, and sat himself down, as if  exhausted, by the table.    'Bernardo,' he said weakly, half apologetically, 'I am overwrought:  there is wine in that jug: I prithee give it me to drink.'    The boy, unhesitating, handed him the flagon.    'It is the symbol of joy redeemed,' he said.  'Put thy lips to the  chalice, Galeazzo, and take what thy soul needest--no more.'    The Duke lifted the cup shakily, stumbled at its brim, steadied himself,  and sipped.  His eyes dilated and grew wolfish--'I am vindicated,' he  stuttered: 'O sweet little saint!'--and he drank greedily, ecstatically,  and, smacking his lips, put down the vessel.    He was himself again from that draught.    'Bernardo,' he said, in a reassured, half-maudlin confidence, 'canst  thou read the stars?'    'Nay,' said the other gravely, 'they are the Sibyls' books.'    'True.  Yet some essay.'    'Ay: then flies a comet, cancelling all their sums.'    'An impious vanity, is it not?'    'Truly, I think so.'    'And deserving of the last chastisement.'    'Poor fools, they make their own.'    'What?'    'Why, taking colds instead of rest--cramps, chills, and agues--immense  pains, and all for nothing; the dead moon for the living sun; nursing  all day that they may starve by night.  God gave us level eyes.  The  star's best resting place for them is on a hill.  We need no more  knowledge than to read beauty through the wise lens Nature hath  proportioned us.  Not God Himself can foretell a future.'    'Not God?'    'No, for there is no Future, nor ever will be.  The Past but eternally  prolongs itself to the Present.  Heaven or hell is the road we tread,  and must retrace when we come to the brink of the abyss where Time drops  sheer into nothingness.  Joy or woe, then, to him the returning  wanderer, according as he hath provisioned his way.  So shall he starve,  or travel in content, or meet with weary retributions.  O, in  providence, hold thy hand, thinking on this, whenever thy hand is  tempted!'    Galeazzo was amazed, discomfited.  This unorthodoxy was the last to  accommodate itself to his principles of conduct.  The Future to him was  always an unmortgaged reversion, sufficient to pay off all debts to  conscience and leave a handsome residue for income.  He could only  exclaim, again, like one aghast: '_No Future_?'    'Nay,' said Bembo, smiling, 'what is the heresy to reason or religion?  To foresee the issues of to-day were, for Omniscience, to suppress all  strains but the angels'. What irony to accept worship from the  foredoomed! What insensate folly wantonly to multiply the devil's  recruits!  O Galeazzo, there is no Future for God or Men?  Hope shudders  at the inexorable word: Evil presumes on it: it is the lodestone to all  dogmatism; the bogey, the weapon of the unversed Churchman; the very  bait to acquisition and self-greed.  Be what, returning, ye would find  yourselves--no lovelier ambition. See, we walk with Christ, the human  God and comrade, I have but this hour left him bathing his tired feet in  the brook.  He will follow anon; and all the pretty birds and insects  and wildflowers he watched while resting will have suggested to him a  thousand tales and reflections gathered of an ancient lore.  He can be  full of wonder too, but wiser by many moons than we.  There is no  Future.  God possesses the Past.'    The Duke sprang to his feet, and went up and down once or twice.  This  view of a self-retaliatory entity--of a returning body condemned by  natural laws to retraverse every point of its upward flight--disturbed  him horribly.  He desired no responsibility in things done and gone.  Eternity, timely propitiated, was his golden chance.  He stopped and  looked at Bembo, at once inexpressibly cringing and crafty.    'Bernardino,' murmured he: 'I can never get it out of my head that  whenever thou sayest God thou meanest gods.  _The gods possess the  past?_--why, one would fancy somehow it ran glibber than the other.'    Bembo sighed.    'Well, why not?  Nature, and Love, and the Holy Ghost--_Tria juncta in  Uno_--why not gods?'    The Duke pressed his hand to his forehead; then ran and clasped the boy  about the shoulders.    'Adorable little wisdom,' he cried: 'take my conscience, and record on  it what thou wilt!'    'To-morrow,' said Bembo, with a happy smile: 'when its tablets are  sponged and clean.'    Galeazzo fawned, showing his teeth.  There was something in him  infinitely suggestive of the cat that, in alternate spasms of animalism,  licks and bites the hand that caresses it.  This strange new heresy of a  limited omniscience oddly affected him.  Could it be possible, after  all, that the soul's responsibility was to itself alone? In any case so  pure a spirit as this could represent him only to his advantage.  Still,  at the same time, if God were no more than relatively wiser and stronger  than himself--why, it was not _his_ theory--let the Parablist answer for  it--on Messer Bembo's saintly head fall the onus, if any, of leaving  Capello where he was.  For his own part, he told himself, the God of  Moses remaining in his old place in the heavens, he, Galeazzo, would  have been inclined to consider the virtuous policy of releasing the  Monk.    And so he prepared himself to confess and communicate.                                        *CHAPTER IX*      The Duke of Milan, confessed, absolved, and his conscience pawned to a  saint, had, on the virtue of that pledge, started in a humour of  unbridled self-righteousness for the territory of Vercelli.  With him  went some four thousand troops, horse and footmen, a drain of bristling  splendour from the city; yet the roaring hum of that city's life, and  the flash and sting thereof, were not appreciably lessened in the flying  of its hornet swarm.  Rather waxed they poignant in the general sense of  a periodic emancipation from a hideous thralldom. The tyrant was gone,  and for a time the intolerable incubus of him was lifted.    But, for the moment, there was something more--a consciousness, within  the precincts of the palace and beyond them, of a substituted  atmosphere, in which the spirit experienced a strange  self-expansion--other than mere relief from strain--which was foreign to  its knowledge.  Men felt it, and pondered, or laughed, or were sceptical  according as their temperaments induced them. So, in droughty days, the  little errant winds that blow from nowhere, rising and falling on a  thought, affect us with a sense of the unaccountable.  There was such a  sweet odd zephyr abroad in Milan.  The queer question was, Was the  little gale a little mountebank gale, tumbling ephemerally for its  living, or did it represent a permanent atmospheric change?    A few days before Galeazzo's departure, Bernardo--by special appointment  _custos conscientiae ducalis_--had, while walking in the outer ward of  the Castello with Cicada, happened upon the vision of a Franciscan monk,  plump and rosy, but with inflammatory eyes, entering with Messer Jacopo  through a private postern in the walls. He had saluted the jocund figure  reverentially, as one necessarily sacred through its calling, and was  standing aside with doffed bonnet, when the other, halting with an  expression of good-humoured curiosity on his face, had greeted him,  puffed and asthmatic, in his turn:--    'Peace to thee, my son!  Can this be he of whom it might be said, \"_Puer  natus est nobis: et vocabitur nomen ejus, Magni Consilii Angelus_\"?'    The Franciscan had rumbled the query at Jacopo, who had shrugged, and  answered shortly: 'Well; 'tis Messer Bembo.'    'So?' had responded the monk, gratified; 'the David of our later  generation?' and instantly and ingratiatory he had waddled up, and,  putting a prosperous hand on Bernardo's shoulder, had bent to whisper  hoarsely, and quite audibly to Cicada, into the boy's ear:--    'Child--I know--I am to thank _thee_ for this summons.'  Then, before  Bembo, wondering, could respond: 'Ay, ay; Saul's ears are opened to the  truth.  The stars cannot lie.  You sent for me, yourself their sainted  emissary, to confirm the verdict.  What!  I might have failed to answer  else.  We know the Duke, eh?  But, mum!'    And with these enigmatic words, and a roguish wink and squeeze, he had  hurried away again, following the impatient summons of Jacopo, who was  beckoning him towards a flight of open stairs niched in the north  curtain, up which the two had thereon gone, and so disappeared among the  battlements.    Then had Bernardo turned, humour battling with reverence in his  sensorium, and 'Cicca!' had exclaimed, with a little click of laughter.    The Fool's answer had been prompt and emphatic.    'Cracked!' he had snapped, like a dog at a fly.    'Who was he?'    'Nay, curtail not his short lease.  He is yet, and, being, is the Fra  Capello--may I die else.'    'Well, if he is, _what_ is he?'    'Why, a short-of-breath monk; yet soon destined, if I read him aright,  to be a breathless monk.'    'Nay, thou wilt only new-knot a riddle.  I will follow and ask the  Provost-Marshal, though I love him not.'    'Nor he thee, methinks.  Hold back.  The butcher looks askance at the  pet lamb.  Well, what wouldst thou?  Of "]]]
