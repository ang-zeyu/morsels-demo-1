But, as Stoicism was your  choice, the argument has seemed to be aimed at that, though it had no  such special application.    _Her_. You are quite right. And now I will be off to metamorphose  myself. When we next meet, there will be no long, shaggy beard, no  artificial composure; I shall be natural, as a gentleman should. I may go  as far as a fashionable coat, by way of publishing my renunciation of  nonsense. I only wish there were an emetic that would purge out every  doctrine they have instilled into me; I assure you, if I could reverse  Chrysippus's plan with the hellebore, and drink forgetfulness, not of the  world but of Stoicism, I would not think twice about it. Well, Lycinus, I  owe you a debt indeed; I was being swept along in a rough turbid torrent,  unresisting, drifting with the stream; when lo, you stood there and  fished me out, a true _deus ex machina_. I have good enough reason,  I think, to shave my head like the people who get clear off from a wreck;  for I am to make votive offerings to-day for the dispersion of that thick  cloud which was over my eyes. Henceforth, if I meet a philosopher on my  walks (and it will not be with my will), I shall turn aside and avoid him  as I would a mad dog.          HERODOTUS AND AETION      I devoutly wish that Herodotus's other characteristics were imitable; not  all of them, of course--that is past praying for--, but any one of them:  the agreeable style, the constructive skill, the native charm of his  Ionic, the sententious wealth, or any of a thousand beauties which he  combined into one whole, to the despair of imitators. But there is one  thing--the use he made of his writings, and the speed with which he  attained the respect of all Greece; from that you, or I, or any one else,  might take a hint. As soon as he had sailed from his Carian home for  Greece, he concentrated his thoughts on the quickest and easiest method  of winning a brilliant reputation for himself and his works. He might  have gone the round, and read them successively at Athens, Corinth,  Argos, and Sparta; but that would be a long toilsome business, he  thought, with no end to it; so he would not do it in detail, collecting  his recognition by degrees, and scraping it together little by little;  his idea was, if possible, to catch all Greece together. The great  Olympic Games were at hand, and Herodotus bethought him that here was the  very occasion on which his heart was set. He seized the moment when the  gathering was at its fullest, and every city had sent the flower of its  citizens; then he appeared in the temple hall, bent not on sight-seeing,  but on bidding for an Olympic victory of his own; he recited his  _Histories_, and bewitched his hearers; nothing would do but each  book must be named after one of the Muses, to whose number they  corresponded.    He was straightway known to all, better far than the Olympic winners.  There was no man who had not heard his name; they had listened to him at  Olympia, or they were told of him by those who had been there; he had  only to appear, and fingers were pointing at him: 'There is the great  Herodotus, who wrote the Persian War in Ionic, and celebrated our  victories.' That was what he made out of his _Histories_; a single  meeting sufficed, and he had the general unanimous acclamation of all  Greece; his name was proclaimed, not by a single herald; every spectator  did that for him, each in his own city.    The royal road to fame was now discovered; it was the regular practice of  many afterwards to deliver their discourses at the festival; Hippias the  rhetorician was on his own ground there; but Prodicus came from Ceos,  Anaximenes from Chios, Polus from Agrigentum; and a rapid fame it  brought, to them and many others.    However, I need not have cited ancient rhetoricians, historians, and  chroniclers like these; in quite recent times the painter Aetion is said  to have brought his picture, _Nuptials of Roxana and Alexander_, to  exhibit at Olympia; and Proxenides, High Steward of the Games on the  occasion, was so delighted with his genius that he gave him his daughter.    It must have been a very wonderful picture, I think I hear some one say,  to make the High Steward give his daughter to a stranger. Well, I have  seen it--it is now in Italy--, so I can tell you. A fair chamber, with  the bridal bed in it; Roxana seated--and a great beauty she is--with  downcast eyes, troubled by the presence of Alexander, who is standing.  Several smiling Loves; one stands behind Roxana, pulling away the veil on  her head to show her to Alexander; another obsequiously draws off her  sandal, suggesting bed-time; a third has hold of Alexander's mantle, and  is dragging him with all his might towards Roxana. The King is offering  her a garland, and by him as supporter and groom's-man is Hephaestion,  holding a lighted torch and leaning on a very lovely boy; this is  Hymenaeus, I conjecture, for there are no letters to show. On the other  side of the picture, more Loves playing among Alexander's armour; two are  carrying his spear, as porters do a heavy beam; two more grasp the  handles of the shield, tugging it along with another reclining on it,  playing king, I suppose; and then another has got into the breast-plate,  which lies hollow part upwards; he is in ambush, and will give the royal  equipage a good fright when it comes within reach.    All this is not idle fancy, on which the painter has been lavishing  needless pains; he is hinting that Alexander has also another love, in  War; though he loves Roxana, he does not forget his armour. And, by the  way, there was some extra nuptial virtue in the picture itself, outside  the realm of fancy; for it did Aetion's wooing for him. He departed with  a wedding of his own as a sort of pendant to that of Alexander;  _his_ groom's-man was the King; and the price of his marriage-piece  was a marriage.    Herodotus, then (to return to him), thought that the Olympic festival  would serve a second purpose very well--that of revealing to the Greeks a  wonderful historian who had related their victories as he had done. As  for me--and in Heaven's name do not suppose me so beside myself as to  intend any comparison between my works and his; I desire his favour too  much for that--but one experience I have in common with him. On my first  visit to Macedonia, _my_ thoughts too were busy with my best policy.  My darling wish was to be known to you all, and to exhibit my writings to  as many Macedonians as might be; I decided that it would be too great an  undertaking at such a time of year to go round in person visiting city by  city; but if I seized the occasion of this your meeting, appeared before  you all, and delivered my discourse, my aspirations, I thought, might be  realized that way.    And now here are you met together, the _elite_ of every city, the  true soul of Macedonia; the town which lodges you is the chief of all,  little enough resembling Pisa, with its crowding, its tents and hovels  and stifling heat; there is as great a difference between this audience  and that promiscuous crowd, mainly intent upon mere athletics, and  thinking of Herodotus only as a stop-gap; here we have orators,  historians, professors, the first in each kind--that is much in itself;  my arena, it seems, need not suffer from comparison with Olympia. And  though, if you insist on matching me with the Polydamases, Glaucuses, and  Milos of literature, you must think me a very presumptuous person, it is  open to you on the other hand to put them out of your thoughts  altogether; and if you strip and examine me independently, you may decide  that at least I need not be whipped. [Footnote: Cf. _Remarks addressed  to an Illiterate Book-fancier_, 9.] Considering the nature of the  contest, I may well be satisfied with that measure of success.          ZEUXIS AND ANTIOCHUS      I was lately walking home after lecturing, when a number of my audience  (you are now my friends, gentlemen, and there can be no objection to my  telling you this)--these persons, then, came to me and introduced  themselves, with the air of admiring hearers. They accompanied me a  considerable way, with such laudatory exclamations that I was reduced to  blushing at the discrepancy between praise and thing praised. Their chief  point, which they were absolutely unanimous in emphasizing, was that the  substance of my work was so fresh, so crammed with novelty. I had better  give you their actual phrases: 'How new! What paradoxes, to be sure! What  invention the man has! His ideas are quite unequalled for originality.'  They said a great deal of this sort about my fascinating lecture, as they  called it; they could have had no motive for pretending, or addressing  such flatteries to a stranger who had no independent claims on their  attention.    These commendations, to be quite frank, were very far from gratifying to  me; when at length they left me to myself, my reflections took this  course:--_So the only attraction in my work is that it is unusual, and  does not follow the beaten track; good vocabulary, orthodox composition,  insight, subtlety, Attic grace, general constructive skill--these may for  aught I know be completely wanting; else indeed they would hardly have  left them unnoticed, and approved my method only as new and startling.  Fool that I was, I did indeed guess, when they jumped up to applaud, that  novelty was part of the attraction; I knew that Homer spoke truly when he  said there is favour for the new song; but I did not see that novelty was  to have so vast a share--the whole, indeed--of the credit; I thought it  gave a sort of adventitious charm, and contributed, its part to the  success, but that the real object of commendation--what extracted the  cheers--was those other qualities. Why, I have been absurdly self-  satisfied, and come very near believing them when they called me the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#18)"],[1,"death of Mrs Partridge,  which, though owing to the distemper above mentioned, which is no  consequence of poverty or distress, many were not ashamed to impute to  Mr Allworthy's severity, or, as they now termed it, cruelty.    Partridge having now lost his wife, his school, and his annuity, and  the unknown person having now discontinued the last-mentioned charity,  resolved to change the scene, and left the country, where he was in  danger of starving, with the universal compassion of all his  neighbours.        Chapter vii.    A short sketch of that felicity which prudent couples may extract from  hatred: with a short apology for those people who overlook  imperfections in their friends.      Though the captain had effectually demolished poor Partridge, yet had  he not reaped the harvest he hoped for, which was to turn the  foundling out of Mr Allworthy's house.    On the contrary, that gentleman grew every day fonder of little Tommy,  as if he intended to counterbalance his severity to the father with  extraordinary fondness and affection towards the son.    This a good deal soured the captain's temper, as did all the other  daily instances of Mr Allworthy's generosity; for he looked on all  such largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth.    In this, we have said, he did not agree with his wife; nor, indeed, in  anything else: for though an affection placed on the understanding is,  by many wise persons, thought more durable than that which is founded  on beauty, yet it happened otherwise in the present case. Nay, the  understandings of this couple were their principal bone of contention,  and one great cause of many quarrels, which from time to time arose  between them; and which at last ended, on the side of the lady, in a  sovereign contempt for her husband; and on the husband's, in an utter  abhorrence of his wife.    As these had both exercised their talents chiefly in the study of  divinity, this was, from their first acquaintance, the most common  topic of conversation between them. The captain, like a well-bred man,  had, before marriage, always given up his opinion to that of the lady;  and this, not in the clumsy awkward manner of a conceited blockhead,  who, while he civilly yields to a superior in an argument, is desirous  of being still known to think himself in the right. The captain, on  the contrary, though one of the proudest fellows in the world, so  absolutely yielded the victory to his antagonist, that she, who had  not the least doubt of his sincerity, retired always from the dispute  with an admiration of her own understanding and a love for his.    But though this complacence to one whom the captain thoroughly  despised, was not so uneasy to him as it would have been had any hopes  of preferment made it necessary to show the same submission to a  Hoadley, or to some other of great reputation in the science, yet even  this cost him too much to be endured without some motive. Matrimony,  therefore, having removed all such motives, he grew weary of this  condescension, and began to treat the opinions of his wife with that  haughtiness and insolence, which none but those who deserve some  contempt themselves can bestow, and those only who deserve no contempt  can bear.    When the first torrent of tenderness was over, and when, in the calm  and long interval between the fits, reason began to open the eyes of  the lady, and she saw this alteration of behaviour in the captain, who  at length answered all her arguments only with pish and pshaw, she was  far from enduring the indignity with a tame submission. Indeed, it at  first so highly provoked her, that it might have produced some  tragical event, had it not taken a more harmless turn, by filling her  with the utmost contempt for her husband's understanding, which  somewhat qualified her hatred towards him; though of this likewise she  had a pretty moderate share.    The captain's hatred to her was of a purer kind: for as to any  imperfections in her knowledge or understanding, he no more despised  her for them, than for her not being six feet high. In his opinion of  the female sex, he exceeded the moroseness of Aristotle himself: he  looked on a woman as on an animal of domestic use, of somewhat higher  consideration than a cat, since her offices were of rather more  importance; but the difference between these two was, in his  estimation, so small, that, in his marriage contracted with Mr  Allworthy's lands and tenements, it would have been pretty equal which  of them he had taken into the bargain. And yet so tender was his  pride, that it felt the contempt which his wife now began to express  towards him; and this, added to the surfeit he had before taken of her  love, created in him a degree of disgust and abhorrence, perhaps  hardly to be exceeded.    One situation only of the married state is excluded from pleasure: and  that is, a state of indifference: but as many of my readers, I hope,  know what an exquisite delight there is in conveying pleasure to a  beloved object, so some few, I am afraid, may have experienced the  satisfaction of tormenting one we hate. It is, I apprehend, to come at  this latter pleasure, that we see both sexes often give up that ease  in marriage which they might otherwise possess, though their mate was  never so disagreeable to them. Hence the wife often puts on fits of  love and jealousy, nay, even denies herself any pleasure, to disturb  and prevent those of her husband; and he again, in return, puts  frequent restraints on himself, and stays at home in company which he  dislikes, in order to confine his wife to what she equally detests.  Hence, too, must flow those tears which a widow sometimes so  plentifully sheds over the ashes of a husband with whom she led a life  of constant disquiet and turbulency, and whom now she can never hope  to torment any more.    But if ever any couple enjoyed this pleasure, it was at present  experienced by the captain and his lady. It was always a sufficient  reason to either of them to be obstinate in any opinion, that the  other had previously asserted the contrary. If the one proposed any  amusement, the other constantly objected to it: they never loved or  hated, commended or abused, the same person. And for this reason, as  the captain looked with an evil eye on the little foundling, his wife  began now to caress it almost equally with her own child.    The reader will be apt to conceive, that this behaviour between the  husband and wife did not greatly contribute to Mr Allworthy's repose,  as it tended so little to that serene happiness which he had designed  for all three from this alliance; but the truth is, though he might be  a little disappointed in his sanguine expectations, yet he was far  from being acquainted with the whole matter; for, as the captain was,  from certain obvious reasons, much on his guard before him, the lady  was obliged, for fear of her brother's displeasure, to pursue the same  conduct. In fact, it is possible for a third person to be very  intimate, nay even to live long in the same house, with a married  couple, who have any tolerable discretion, and not even guess at the  sour sentiments which they bear to each other: for though the whole  day may be sometimes too short for hatred, as well as for love; yet  the many hours which they naturally spend together, apart from all  observers, furnish people of tolerable moderation with such ample  opportunity for the enjoyment of either passion, that, if they love,  they can support being a few hours in company without toying, or if  they hate, without spitting in each other's faces.    It is possible, however, that Mr Allworthy saw enough to render him a  little uneasy; for we are not always to conclude, that a wise man is  not hurt, because he doth not cry out and lament himself, like those  of a childish or effeminate temper. But indeed it is possible he might  see some faults in the captain without any uneasiness at all; for men  of true wisdom and goodness are contented to take persons and things  as they are, without complaining of their imperfections, or attempting  to amend them. They can see a fault in a friend, a relation, or an  acquaintance, without ever mentioning it to the parties themselves, or  to any others; and this often without lessening their affection.  Indeed, unless great discernment be tempered with this overlooking  disposition, we ought never to contract friendship but with a degree  of folly which we can deceive; for I hope my friends will pardon me  when I declare, I know none of them without a fault; and I should be  sorry if I could imagine I had any friend who could not see mine.  Forgiveness of this kind we give and demand in turn. It is an exercise  of friendship, and perhaps none of the least pleasant. And this  forgiveness we must bestow, without desire of amendment. There is,  perhaps, no surer mark of folly, than an attempt to correct the  natural infirmities of those we love. The finest composition of human  nature, as well as the finest china, may have a flaw in it; and this,  I am afraid, in either case, is equally incurable; though,  nevertheless, the pattern may remain of the highest value.    Upon the whole, then, Mr Allworthy certainly saw some imperfections in  the captain; but as this was a very artful man, and eternally upon his  guard before him, these appeared to him no more than blemishes in a  good character, which his goodness made him overlook, and his wisdom  prevented him from discovering to the captain himself. Very different  would have been his sentiments had he discovered the whole; which  perhaps would in time have been the case, had the husband and wife  long continued this kind of behaviour to each other; but this kind  Fortune took effectual means to prevent, by forcing the captain to do  that which rendered him again dear to his wife, and restored all her  tenderness and affection towards him.
