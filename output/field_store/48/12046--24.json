And I shall speak before a great crowd of people, coughing  and hiccuping as I am--for all my life I have eaten too heartily. And  very hard-hearted must you be if you shed no tears when you hear what  I shall have to say.    \"'I shall shed many tears,' answers King Philip.    \"And now His Sacred Majesty is speaking to his valet, a man named  Dubois.    \"'Bring me some sugar dipped in Madeira,' he cries. 'I have the  hiccups. Pray heaven they do not attack me when I am making my  speech before all those people. Oh, that goose I had last night  for dinner! Will it never pass? I think I had better take a glass  of Orleans wine? No, it is too harsh. Or perhaps if I ate some  anchovies? No, they are oily. Dubois, there, give me some Roman wine!'    \"Dubois does as he is told, then dresses his master in a robe of  crimson velvet, wraps a golden cloak about him, girds on his sword,  places the globe and sceptre in his hands, and on his head the  crown. Thus arrayed, His Sacred Majesty goes forth from the Park  House, riding on a little mule and followed by King Philip and many  notables. Presently they arrive at a large building called the Palace,  and they come to a room wherein is a tall thin man, most richly  dressed. He is the Prince of Orange, William, surnamed the Silent.    \"'Do I look well, Cousin William?' His Sacred Majesty inquires.    \"But the man makes no answer, till at length His Sacred Majesty speaks  again, half mused, half angry.    \"'Still silent, cousin? Still without a word?--even when you have  the chance of telling the truth to a grey-beard! Come now, shall I  abdicate or stay upon my throne, O silent one?'    \"'Most Sacred Majesty,' replies the thin man, 'at the approach of  winter even the strongest oaks let fall their leaves.'    \"Three o'clock strikes.    \"'Lend me your shoulder, silent one, that I may lean upon it.'    \"And, so saying, His Most Sacred Majesty leads the way into a great  room wherein is a canopy, and under the canopy a dais covered with  a carpet of crimson silk. On the dais are three chairs. His Sacred  Majesty seats himself on the mid-most one, which is more ornamented  than the others and surmounted by the imperial crown. King Philip takes  the second chair, and the third is occupied by a woman, who is no doubt  the Queen. On either side are long benches covered with tapestry, and  sitting upon them are men dressed in red robes and wearing round their  necks the image of a golden sheep. Behind stand various personages who  would seem to be princes and lords. Opposite these, and at the bottom  of the dais, there is a row of bare benches which are occupied by men  dressed in plain cloth. I hear it said that these men are clothed and  seated so modestly because it is themselves that have to pay all the  costs. At the entrance of His Sacred Majesty these people all stand  up, but when he has sat down he makes a sign and they sit also.    \"Now a very aged man is talking of his gout interminably. After which  the woman, who seems to be a Queen, presents a roll of parchment to  His Majesty. His Sacred Majesty reads what is written thereon in a low  voice, coughing all the time, and then he begins to speak for himself.    \"'Many and long are the journeys that I have made through Spain and  Italy and the Netherlands, through England and through Africa, all for  God's glory, for the renown of my arms, and the good of my peoples.'    \"And so on, and so on, till at last he comes to tell of his growing  weakness and fatigue, and of his determination to relinquish the  crown of Spain, together with the counties, duchies, and marquisates  of all those countries, and of his desire to hand them over to his  son. Thereafter he begins to weep, and every one weeps with him, and  King Philip gets up from his chair and falls upon his knees before  his father.    \"'Most Sacred Majesty,' he cries, 'am I indeed to receive this crown  from your hands while yet you are so strong to wear it?'    \"Then His Majesty whispers into his son's ear that he should speak  some kindly words to those men who are seated upon the tapestried  chairs. Whereupon King Philip turns towards them, and without rising  addresses them in a sharp tone of voice.    \"'I understand French fairly well,' he says, 'but not well enough to  be able to talk to any one in that language. But the Bishop of Arras,  Monsieur Grandvelle, he will say something to you on my behalf.'    \"'That is not the way to speak to them, my son,' says His Sacred  Majesty.    \"And in truth the whole assembly begins to murmur, seeing the  young King so proud and unbending. The woman, she who is the Queen,  then makes an oration, and is followed by an aged professor, who,  on sitting down, receives a wave of the hand from His Sacred Majesty  by way of thanks. These ceremonies and harangues being finished, His  Sacred Majesty makes a declaration to the effect that his subjects  are released from their oath of fidelity, signs the deeds drawn up  to ratify his abdication, and then, rising from his throne, places  his son upon it in his stead. Every one in the hall weeps. Then they  return again to the Park House.    \"Once more His Sacred Majesty and his son Philip are alone together in  the green chamber. As soon as the doors are shut His Sacred Majesty  goes off into a peal of laughter, and begins talking to King Philip,  who keeps quite solemn all the time.    \"'Did you notice,' says the Emperor, laughing and hiccuping at the  same time, 'how little was needed to move these good people to tears?  Heavens, how they wept! You would have thought it was the deluge!  That fat Maes who made the long speech, why, he cried like a calf!  Even you appeared to be affected--but not quite sufficiently,  perhaps. Really there is no doubt that these are the best of all the  entertainments which one can provide for the populace. For just as we  nobles are wont to cherish most those mistresses who cost us most,  so also it is with the people. The more we make them pay the more  they love us. That is why I have tolerated the reformed religion  in Germany while punishing it severely in the Low Countries. If,  however, the German princes had been Catholics I would have made  myself a Lutheran so that I might confiscate their property. Verily  they all believe in the integrity of my zeal for the Roman faith,  and when I leave them they are full of regrets. Yet for heresy there  have perished at my hands fifty thousand of their bravest men and of  their tenderest maidens, in the Netherlands alone. But still they  grieve at my departure. And without making any count of what has  been got from confiscations, I have raised in taxes more than the  wealth of all the Indies or Peru; yet they are sorry to lose me.  And I have torn up the Peace of Cadzant, brought the city of Ghent  under subjection, suppressed every one who might be dangerous to  me, put down all liberties, freedoms, and privileges, and placed  them under the authority of the royal officers; but yet do these  good people think they are still free inasmuch as I allow them to  shoot with the crossbow, and to carry in procession the banners of  their guilds. Willingly do they submit themselves to the hand of  their master, finding happiness in a cage, and singing his praises  while he is with them, and weeping when he departs. My son, be you  to them even as I have been, kindly in words but harsh in deed. Lick  that which you have no need to bite, and never leave off swearing  to maintain liberties, freedoms, and privileges, however little you  may scruple to destroy those liberties if they show signs of becoming  dangerous. For such things as these are like iron if handled timidly,  but brittle as glass if grappled with a strong hand. Therefore you  should root out all heresy, not because it differs from the Roman  religion, but because, if allowed to flourish, it would mean the end  of our rule in all the Netherlands. For they that attack the Pope  with his three crowns would finish by denying the authority of the  temporal princes who wear but one. So, then, you should follow my  example, and regard all claims to freedom of conscience as crimes  of high treason to be punished by immediate confiscation. Hereby  you will inherit great riches, as I also have done all my life long;  and when you come to die or to abdicate, everybody will say, 'Ah me,  the good and noble prince!' and many are the tears that will be shed!'    \"And now I hear no more,\" said Nele, \"for His Sacred Majesty has laid  him down to sleep. And King Philip, that proud and haughty prince,  stands gazing at him with loveless eyes.\"    And when she had thus spoken, Nele was awakened from her trance by  Katheline. And Claes gazed thoughtfully into the fire as it flamed  and lit up all the chimney.              XXXV      It was the month of April. The weather had been mild, but now there  was come a sharp frost and a sky grey and overcast as it were the  sky of All Souls' Day. The third year of Ulenspiegel's banishment had  long since passed, and Nele was waiting day after day for the return  of her lover.    \"Alas!\" she cried, \"there will be snow on the pear-trees, and snow  upon the flowering jasmines, and on all the poor plants that have  bloomed in confidence of the mildness and the warmth of an early  spring. Already from the sky little snowflakes are falling on the  roads. And on my poor heart as well the snow is falling.    \"Where, oh where are the bright rays of sunshine that should be playing  now on our happy spring-time faces--and upon red roofs that were used  to grow the redder for that warmth, and on window-panes that flashed  as they caught that sunny brightness? Where indeed are those flaming  beams that kindled earth to life again, and the sky, and the birds,  and the insects? Alas! For day and night am I chilled by sorrow and  long waiting.

A Mr Warren, of whom no one had ever heard except that he was a nabob,  had recently returned from India and purchased a large estate in the  north of England, was returned to Parliament one of the representatives  of a close borough which he had purchased: a quiet, gentlemanlike,  middle-aged man, with no decided political opinions; and, as parties  were then getting very equal, of course very much courted. The throes of  Lord North's administration were commencing. The minister asked the new  member to dine with him, and found the new member singularly free from  all party prejudices. Mr Warren was one of those members who announced  their determination to listen to the debates and to be governed by the  arguments. All complimented him, all spoke to him. Mr Fox declared that  he was a most superior man; Mr Burke said that these were the men who  could alone save the country. Mrs Crewe asked him to supper; he was  caressed by the most brilliant of duchesses.    At length there arrived one of those fierce trials of strength, which  precede the fall of a minister, but which sometimes from peculiar  circumstances, as in the instances of Walpole and Lord North, are  not immediate in their results. How would Warren vote? was the great  question. He would listen to the arguments. Burke was full of confidence  that he should catch Warren. The day before the debate there was a  levee, which Mr Warren attended. The sovereign stopped him, spoke to  him, smiled on him, asked him many questions: about himself, the House  of Commons, how he liked it, how he liked England. There was a flutter  in the circle; a new favourite at court.    The debate came off, the division took place. Mr Warren voted for the  minister. Burke denounced him; the king made him a baronet.    Sir John Warren made a great alliance, at least for him; he married the  daughter of an Irish earl; became one of the king's friends; supported  Lord Shelburne, threw over Lord Shelburne, had the tact early to  discover that Mr Pitt was the man to stick to, stuck to him. Sir John  Warren bought another estate, and picked up another borough. He was  fast becoming a personage. Throughout the Indian debates he kept himself  extremely quiet; once indeed in vindication of Mr Hastings, whom he  greatly admired, he ventured to correct Mr Francis on a point of fact  with which he was personally acquainted. He thought that it was safe,  but he never spoke again. He knew not the resources of vindictive genius  or the powers of a malignant imagination. Burke owed the Nabob a turn  for the vote which had gained him a baronetcy. The orator seized the  opportunity and alarmed the secret conscience of the Indian adventurer  by his dark allusions, and his fatal familiarity with the subject.    Another estate however and another borough were some consolation for  this little misadventure; and in time the French Revolution, to Sir  John's great relief, turned the public attention for ever from Indian  affairs. The Nabob from the faithful adherent of Mr Pitt had become even  his personal friend. The wits indeed had discovered that he had been a  waiter; and endless were the epigrams of Fitzpatrick and the jokes of  Hare; but Mr Pitt cared nothing about the origin of his supporters. On  the contrary, Sir John was exactly the individual from whom the minister  meant to carve out his plebeian aristocracy; and using his friend as  a feeler before he ventured on his greater operations, the Nabob one  morning was transformed into an Irish baron.    The new Baron figured in his patent as Lord Fitz-Warene, his Norman  origin and descent from the old barons of this name having been  discovered at Herald's college. This was a rich harvest for Fitzpatrick  and Hare; but the public gets accustomed to everything, and has an easy  habit of faith. The new Baron cared nothing for ridicule, for he was  working for posterity. He was compensated for every annoyance by the  remembrance that the St James's Street waiter was ennobled, and by his  determination that his children should rank still higher in the proud  peerage of his country. So he obtained the royal permission to resume  the surname and arms of his ancestors, as well as their title.    There was an ill-natured story set afloat, that Sir John owed this  promotion to having lent money to the minister; but this was a calumny.  Mr Pitt never borrowed money of his friends. Once indeed, to save his  library, he took a thousand pounds from an individual on whom he had  conferred high rank and immense promotion: and this individual, who  had the minister's bond when Mr Pitt died, insisted on his right,  and actually extracted the 1,000 l. from the insolvent estate of his  magnificent patron. But Mr Pitt always preferred an usurer to a friend;  and to the last day of his life borrowed money at fifty per cent.    The Nabob departed this life before the Minister, but he lived long  enough to realize his most aspiring dream. Two years before his death  the Irish baron was quietly converted into an English peer; and without  exciting any attention, all the squibs of Fitzpatrick, all the jokes of  Hare, quite forgotten, the waiter of the St James's Street club took his  seat in the most natural manner possible in the House of Lords.    The great estate of the late Lord Fitz-Warene was situated at Mowbray, a  village which principally belonged to him, and near which he had raised  a gothic castle, worthy of his Norman name and ancestry. Mowbray was one  of those places which during the long war had expanded from an almost  unknown village to a large and flourishing manufacturing town; a  circumstance, which, as Lady Marney observed, might have somewhat  deteriorated the atmosphere of the splendid castle, but which had  nevertheless doubled the vast rental of its lord. He who had succeeded  to his father was Altamont Belvidere (named after his mother's family)  Fitz-Warene, Lord Fitz-Warene. He was not deficient in abilities,  though he had not his father's talents, but he was over-educated for his  intellect; a common misfortune. The new Lord Fitz-Warene was the  most aristocratic of breathing beings. He most fully, entirely, and  absolutely believed in his pedigree; his coat of arms was emblazoned  on every window, embroidered on every chair, carved in every corner.  Shortly after his father's death he was united to the daughter of a  ducal house, by whom he had a son and two daughters, chrisened by names  which the ancient records of the Fitz-Warenes authorised. His son, who  gave promise of abilities which might have rendered the family really  distinguished, was Valence; his daughters, Joan and Maud. All that  seemed wanting to the glory of the house was a great distinction of  which a rich peer, with six seats in the House of Commons, could not  ultimately despair. Lord Fitz-Warene aspired to rank among the earls  of England. But the successors of Mr Pitt were strong; they thought the  Fitz-Warenes had already been too rapidly advanced; it was whispered  that the king did not like the new man; that his majesty thought him  pompous, full of pretence, in short, a fool. But though the successors  of Mr Pitt managed to govern the country for twenty years and were  generally very strong, in such an interval of time however good their  management or great their luck, there were inevitably occasions  when they found themselves in difficulties, when it was necessary to  conciliate the lukewarm or to reward the devoted. Lord Fitz-Warene well  understood how to avail himself of these occasions; it was astonishing  how conscientious and scrupulous he became during Walcheren expeditions,  Manchester massacres, Queen's trials. Every scrape of the government was  a step in the ladder to the great borough-monger. The old king too had  disappeared from the stage; and the tawdry grandeur of the great Norman  peer rather suited George the Fourth. He was rather a favourite at the  Cottage; they wanted his six votes for Canning; he made his terms; and  one of the means by which we got a man of genius for a minister, was  elevating Lord Fitz-Warene in the peerage, by the style and title of  Earl de Mowbray of Mowbray Castle.          Book 2 Chapter 8        We must now for a while return to the strangers of the Abbey ruins. When  the two men had joined the beautiful Religious, whose apparition had so  startled Egremont, they all three quitted the Abbey by a way which led  them by the back of the cloister garden, and so on by the bank of the  river for about a hundred yards, when they turned up the winding glen of  a dried-up tributary stream. At the head of the glen, at which they soon  arrived, was a beer-shop, screened by some huge elms from the winds that  blew over the vast moor, which, except in the direction of Mardale, now  extended as far as the eye could reach. Here the companions stopped, the  beautiful Religious seated herself on a stone bench beneath the trees,  while the elder stranger calling out to the inmate of the house to  apprise him of his return, himself proceeded to a neighbouring shed,  whence he brought forth a very small rough pony with a rude saddle, but  one evidently intended for a female rider.    \"It is well,\" said the taller of the men \"that I am not a member of a  temperance society like you, Stephen, or it would be difficult to reward  this good man for his care of our steed. I will take a cup of the drink  of Saxon kings.\" Then leading up the pony to the Religious, he placed  her on its back with gentleness and much natural grace, saying at the  same time in a subdued tone, \"And you--shall I bring you a glass of  nature's wine?\"    \"I have drank of the spring of the Holy Abbey,\" said the Religious, \"and  none other must touch my lips this eve.\"    \"Come, our course must be"]]]
