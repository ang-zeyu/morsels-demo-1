AFFAIRS IN AND AROUND PRETORIA--THE CAPTURE OF MIDDELBURG    Late in June, at the time of the armistice before-mentioned, there seemed  to have been some hesitation on the part of Botha and Kruger whether they  should unconditionally surrender, but they were incapable of decisive  action while Steyn, who now had nothing to lose and everything to gain,  kept the field. The position was best described by Mr. Spenser Wilkinson  when he likened Kruger and Steyn to Hannibal and Hasdrubal: \"the  strongest proof that his cause was lost that could be given to Hannibal  was Hasdrubal's head sent into his camp.\" Another important consideration  influenced the President in his hesitation; he bargained, or wished to  bargain, that he might remain in the country, a condition which of course  could not be entertained.    Both Mrs. Kruger and Mrs. Botha exerted themselves to bring about the  termination of the useless struggle. One went to her husband's camp in  hope to influence him, while the other wrote imploring her better half to  come to terms. But their efforts were of no avail. According to some  accounts, the President was in the hands of his generals, who, declaring  he had played his cards and played them badly, arrogated to themselves  the right to judge when hostilities should cease. He was, moreover, in  bad odour even with his own burghers, and many of them were openly  denouncing him for his conduct in feathering his own nest, and leaving  his compatriots alone to face ruin and extricate themselves from the  hurly-burly into which he had inveigled them. His foreign mercenaries,  too, were furious. They had been calculating on magnificent rewards for  their championship of the Boer cause, and now found it hard to digest the  philosophic maxim, \"Blessed are they who expect nothing, for they shall  not be disappointed!\"    On the 24th, 25th, and 26th of June, efforts were made to surround the  enemy in the hills some fifteen miles to the east beyond Silverton.  General French on the left, General Ian Hamilton on the right, and the  Eleventh Division in the centre engaged in the enveloping movement; but,  by the night of Tuesday the 26th, there was nothing to envelop--the Boers  had vanished along the Delagoa Bay Railway. The operation caused a loss  of about 150.    Stringent measures had now to be adopted to frustrate the wily efforts of  the Boer generals to obtain news of the military movements of the  British. The town was teeming with spies, who actively communicated to  the foe the secret doings of the authorities, and diffused intelligence  in relation to the intentions of the Boer forces, which was both alarming  and paralysing to the inhabitants. It was reported that a combination  existed between the Boer leader without the town and the burghers who had  surrendered within it, to join forces and attack the place, and in  consequence of these rumours extensive precautions were adopted, the  number of guards around the capital were increased, and armoured trains  patrolled the line daily. Nevertheless, in other ways the town was  assuming a more business-like and settled aspect. Some of the Dutch  women, knowing themselves safe in the hands of the British, continued to  flaunt their national colours, while others flung insulting epithets at  the officers, thus unintentionally and subtly complimenting them, as such  demeanour demonstrated a firm conviction on the part of the ladies that  those whom they insulted were too chivalrous to retaliate.    Revelations respecting the intrigues of the late Transvaal Government  came gradually to hand, and documents found in Pretoria divulged some  unpleasant secrets. First, that large bribes had been paid to sundry  prominent foreigners who had visited the Transvaal during the war and  promised intervention; second, that letters of dubious complexion had  been sent by certain members of the British House of Commons to the  Boers--letters which those who were apt to dub a spade a spade called  traitorous, and others who talked of \"implement of agriculture\" styled  unpatriotic!    The enemy, who had succeeded in capturing Lieutenant Rundle (6th Dragoon  Guards) and some men of his patrol, continued to engage himself in  mischief around the right flank, so much so that Lord Roberts decided  that he must make a clean sweep towards the east of Bronker's Spruit. It  must be remembered that after the battle of Diamond Hill the Boers had  moved off, only to widen, if to thin, their half-circle round the  neighbourhood of Pretoria. Botha remained astride the Delagoa Railway  line toward the east, threatening with his left, so far as he dared, the  south-east of the town. Grobler gathered his force on the north, while  beyond him, to north-west, went Delarey and his hovering hordes, bent on  menacing the road to Rustenburg. It was impossible as yet to engage in  very decisive operations owing to lack of remounts, but some action was  necessary.    Accordingly, General Hutton's Mounted Infantry was despatched to  reinforce Colonel Mahon, who on the 6th of July was attacked at  Rietfontein by some 3000 Boers with six guns and two Vickers-Maxims.  Fighting fierce and sustained was continued for two days, when the  desired object was achieved, and the Boers cleared from the immediate  neighbourhood. The Imperial Light Horse, brilliant as ever, unhappily  lost two officers--Captain Currie and Lieutenant Kirk--and thirteen men,  their unusual loss being occasioned by the gallantry of B Squadron in  pressing to the assistance of a wounded comrade in the teeth of a host of  the enemy.    Poor young Kirk was a volunteer in the highest sense of the term. His  career was typical of the careers of many of the gallant Colonials who  rushed to the aid of their country. He had served in the Matabele War,  and jumped to arms at the outbreak of the present campaign. He was  conspicuous among the heroes of the heroic regiment during the siege of  Ladysmith, and was wounded while binding up the injuries of a comrade. He  received his commission, and afterwards took part in the famous relief of  Mafeking, and later, was again wounded, and severely, while out on patrol  with Colonel Baden-Powell. Nevertheless he managed to rejoin the Imperial  Light Horse in the great advance _via_ Lichtenburg and Potchefstroom to  Johannesburg and Pretoria. Among others wounded was Captain and Adjutant  Nelles, 1st Battalion Canadian Mounted Rifles.    General Hutton on the following day was attacked by 5000 of the enemy  near Rietfontein, but he succeeded in routing his assailants, capturing a  French officer and inflicting considerable loss, the enemy leaving their  injured upon the field. Lieutenant Young, 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles,  was slightly wounded.    [Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY.

Report came in from Ladysmith that some 800 prisoners--Yeomanry  and Derbyshire Militia--without officers, had been put over the Natal  border from Reitz, and were making their way towards Acton Homes. The  plight of these unhappy fellows, without food, tattered, torn, and  limping, with only a poor acquaintanceship with the country through which  they plodded, was deplorable. Waggons and food were sent out by the O.C.  of the Drakensberg Defence Force, and the wretched men were encountered  and brought in. Having been marched about for over a month with De Wet,  they were so footsore and exhausted that some could barely crawl. The  Boers had treated them well, but they had too many mouths of their own to  feed, and had been forced by the pressure of circumstance to turn them  adrift.    [Illustration: NITRAL'S NEK.]    On the 11th Botha decided there should be fighting all along the line,  and so cleverly were things managed that the British suffered  considerably. At dawn the Boers under Delarey, having failed in getting  round the right rear of the British, collected on the hills surrounding  Nitral's Nek with a view to attacking the left flank. Nitral's Nek, a  position some eighteen miles west of Pretoria, near where the road  crosses the Crocodile River, was held in order to maintain telegraphic  and road communication with Rustenburg. Garrisoning this place were one  squadron of Scots Greys, two guns of O Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and  five companies of the Lincolnshire Regiment. The Dutchmen were in great  force, and admirably disposed, evidently by a preconcerted arrangement,  and succeeded in directing a converging fire on the small garrison and on  the various portions of it occupying the plain some distance off. As  early as possible the news of the attack was sent to Pretoria, whereupon  the King's Own Scottish Borderers, under Colonel Godfrey, were despatched  to the rescue. It took some hours to reach the scene of the fray, and by  the time the reinforcements arrived the small garrison, who had been  fighting all day, and had expended their ammunition, were overpowered. It  appeared that about this time the Scots Greys had been ordered to proceed  to Crocodile Bridge to relieve General Baden-Powell. They followed the  same route they had taken when marching to relieve the prisoners at  Watervall, a route with only one attraction--it passed through one of the  most golden orange groves of the Transvaal, and jaded and depressed as  they were, they felt thankful that their ways were cast among the  refreshing fruit. A squadron was left at Tulikat's or Nitral's Nek, while  the rest of the party, cold, worn, and famishing, reached camp at 10 P.M.  on the 7th. On Sunday, the 8th, the force still "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4633"],[0,"Philip Steele of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (#18)"],[1,"him.    \"No, we won't fight, but we'll wrap up in the same blankets, and die,  with Woonga, there, keeping our backs warm until the last. Eh, Woonga,  will you do that?\"    He turned cheerily to the dog, and Woonga rose slowly and with  unmistakable stiffness of limb, and was fastened in the sledge traces.    They went on through the desolate gloom of afternoon, which in late  winter is, above the sixtieth, all but night. Ahead of them there seemed  to rise billow upon billow of snow-mountains, which dwarfed themselves  into drifted dunes when they approached, and the heaven above them, and  the horizon on all sides of them were shut out from their vision by a  white mist which was intangible and without substance and yet which rose  like a wall before their eyes. It was one chaos of white mingling with  another chaos of white, a chaos of white earth smothered and torn by  the Arctic wind under a chaos of white sky; and through it all, saplings  that one might have twisted and broken over his knee were magnified into  giants at a distance of half a hundred paces, and men and dog looked  like huge specters moving with bowed heads through a world that was no  longer a world of life, but of dead and silent things. And up out of  this, after a time, rose DeBar's voice, chanting in tones filled with  the savagery of the North, a wild song that was half breed and half  French, which the forest men sing in their joy when coming very near to  home.    They went on, hour after hour, until day gloom thickened into night,  and night drifted upward to give place to gray dawn, plodding steadily  north, resting now and then, fighting each mile of the way to the Red  Porcupine against the stinging lashes of the Arctic wind. And through it  all it was DeBar's voice that rose in encouragement to the dog limping  behind him and to the man limping behind the dog--now in song, now in  the wild shouting of the sledge-driver, his face thin and gaunt in its  starved whiteness, but his eyes alive with a strange fire. And it was  DeBar who lifted his mittened hands to the leaden chaos of sky when they  came to the frozen streak that was the Red Porcupine, and said, in a  voice through which there ran a strange thrill of something deep and  mighty, \"God in Heaven be praised, this is the end!\"    He started into a trot now, and the dog trotted behind him, and behind  the dog trotted Philip, wondering, as he had wondered a dozen times  before that night, if DeBar were going mad. Five hundred yards down  the stream DeBar stopped in his tracks, stared for a moment into the  breaking gloom of the shore, and turned to Philip. He spoke in a voice  low and trembling, as if overcome for the moment by some strong emotion.    \"See--see there!\" he whispered. \"I've hit it, Philip Steele, and what  does it mean? I've come over seventy miles of barren, through night an'  storm, an' I've hit Pierre Thoreau's cabin as fair as a shot! Oh, man,  man, I couldn't do it once in ten thousand times!\" He gripped Philip's  arm, and his voice rose in excited triumph. \"I tell 'ee, it means  that--that God--'r something--must be with me!\"    \"With us,\" said Philip, staring hard.    \"With me,\" replied DeBar so fiercely that the other started  involuntarily. \"It's a miracle, an omen, and it means that I'm going to  win!\" His fingers gripped deeper, and he said more gently, \"Phil, I've  grown to like you, and if you believe in God as we believe in Him up  here--if you believe He tells things in the stars, the winds and things  like this, if you're afraid of death--take some grub and go back! I mean  it, Phil, for if you stay, an' fight, there is going to be but one end.  I will kill you!\"        Chapter XII. The Fight--And A Strange Visitor    At DeBar's words the blood leaped swiftly through Philip's veins, and he  laughed as he flung the outlaw's hand from his arm.    \"I'm not afraid of death,\" he cried angrily. \"Don't take me for a child,  William DeBar. How long since you found this God of yours?\"    He spoke the words half tauntingly, and as soon regretted them, for in  a voice that betrayed no anger at the slur DeBar said: \"Ever since my  mother taught me the first prayer, Phil. I've killed three men and I've  helped to hang three others, and still I believe in a God, and I've halt  a notion He believes a little bit in me, in spite of the laws made down  in Ottawa.\"    The cabin loomed up amid a shelter of spruce like a black shadow, and  when they climbed up the bank to it they found the snow drifted high  under the window and against the door.    \"He's gone--Pierre, I mean,\" said DeBar over his shoulder as he kicked  the snow away. \"He hasn't come back from New Year's at Fort Smith.\"    The door had no lock or bolt, and they entered. It was yet too dark for  them to see distinctly, and DeBar struck a match. On the table was a tin  oil lamp, which he lighted. It revealed a neatly kept interior about a  dozen feet square, with two bunks, several chairs, a table, and a sheet  iron stove behind which was piled a supply of wood. DeBar pointed to a  shelf on which were a number of tin boxes, their covers weighted down by  chunks of wood.    \"Grub!\" he said.    And Philip, pointing to the wood, added, \"Fire--fire and grub.\"    There was something in his voice which the other could not fail to  understand, and there was an uncomfortable silence as Philip put fuel  into the stove and DeBar searched among the food cans.    \"Here's bannock and cooked meat--frozen,\" he said, \"and beans.\"    He placed tins of each on the stove and then sat down beside the roaring  fire, which was already beginning to diffuse a heat. He held out his  twisted and knotted hands, blue and shaking with cold, and looked up at  Philip, who stood opposite him.    He spoke no words, and yet there was something in his eyes which made  the latter cry out softly, and with a feeling which he tried to hide:  \"DeBar, I wish to God it was over!\"    \"So do I,\" said DeBar.    He rubbed his hands and twisted them until the knuckles cracked.    \"I'm not afraid and I know that you're not, Phil,\" he went on, with his  eyes on the top of the stove, \"but I wish it was over, just the same.  Somehow I'd a'most rather stay up here another year or two than--kill  you.\"    \"Kill me!\" exclaimed Philip, the old fire leaping back into his veins.    DeBar's quiet voice, his extraordinary self-confidence, sent a flush of  anger into Philip's face.    \"You're talking to me again as if I were a child, DeBar. My instructions  were to bring you back, dead or alive--and I'm going to!\"    \"We won't quarrel about it, Phil,\" replied the outlaw as quietly as  before. \"Only I wish it wasn't you I'm going to fight. I'd rather kill  half-a-dozen like the others than you.\"    \"I see,\" said Philip, with a perceptible sneer in his voice.  \"You're trying to work upon my sympathy so that I will follow your  suggestion--and go back. Eh?\"    \"You'd be a coward if you did that,\" retorted DeBar quickly. \"How are we  going to settle it, Phil?\"    Philip drew his frozen revolver from its holster and held it over the  stove.    \"If I wasn't a crack shot, and couldn't center a two-inch bull's-eye  three times out of four at thirty paces, I'd say pistols.\"    \"I can't do that,\" said DeBar unhesitatingly, \"but I have hit a wolf  twice out of five shots. It'll be a quick, easy way, and we'll settle it  with our revolvers. Going to shoot to kill?\"    \"No, if I can help it. In the excitement a shot may kill, but I want to  take you back alive, so I'll wing you once or twice first.\"    \"I always shoot to kill,\" replied DeBar, without lifting his head. \"Any  word you'd like to have sent home, Phil?\"    In the other's silence DeBar looked up.    \"I mean it,\" he said, in a low earnest voice. \"Even from your point  of view it might happen, Phil, and you've got friends somewhere. It  anything should happen to me you'll find a letter in my pocket. I want  you to write to--to her--an' tell her I died in--an accident. Will you?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Philip. \"As for me, you'll find addresses in my pocket,  too. Let's shake!\"    Over the stove they gripped hands.    \"My eyes hurt,\" said DeBar. \"It's the snow and wind, I guess. Do you  mind a little sleep--after we eat? I haven't slept a wink in three days  and nights.\"    \"Sleep until you're ready,\" urged Philip. \"I don't want to fight bad  eyes.\"    They ate, mostly in silence, and when the meal was done Philip carefully  cleaned his revolver and oiled it with bear grease, which he found in a  bottle on the shelf.    DeBar watched him as he wiped his weapon and saw that Philip lubricated  each of the five cartridges which he put in the chamber.    Afterward they smoked.    Then DeBar stretched himself out in one of the two bunks, and his heavy  breathing soon gave evidence that he was sleeping.    For a time Philip sat beside the stove, his eyes upon the inanimate  form of the outlaw. Drowsiness overcame him then, and he rolled into  the other bunk. He was awakened several hours later by DeBar, who was  filling the stove with wood.    \"How's the eyes?\" he asked, sitting up.    \"Good,\" said the other. \"Glad you're awake. The light will be bad inside  of an hour.\"    He was rubbing and warming his hands, and Philip came to the opposite  side of the stove and rubbed and warmed his hands. For some reason he  found it difficult to look at DeBar, and he knew that DeBar was not  looking at him.    It was the outlaw who broke the suspense.    \"I've been outside,\" he said in a low voice. \"There's an open in front  of the cabin, just a hundred paces across. It wouldn't be a bad idea  for us to stand at opposite sides of the open and at a given signal  approach, firing as we want to.\"    \"Couldn't be better,\" exclaimed Philip briskly, turning to pull his  revolver from its holster.    DeBar watched him with tensely anxious eyes as he broke the breech,  looked at the shining circle of cartridges, and closed it again."]]]
