All this work is wholesome and good, and goes on steadily, giving us  health and strength and new power; but if we, through mismanagement,  make heart or lungs or stomach work harder than they should, then  they must rob us of power to accomplish what we give them to do, and  we blame them, instead of blaming ourselves for being hard and  unjust taskmasters.    The strain in a stomach necessary to the digesting of too much food,  or the wrong kind of food, makes itself felt in strain all through  the whole system.    I knew a woman whose conscience was troubling her very greatly. She  was sure she had done many very selfish things for which there was  no excuse, and that she herself was greatly to blame for other  people's troubles. This was a very acute attack of conscience,  accompanied by a very severe stomach ache. The doctor was called in  and gave her an emetic. She threw a large amount of undigested food  from her stomach, and after that relief the weight on her conscience  was lifted entirely and she had nothing more to blame herself with  than any ordinary, wholesome woman must have to look out for every  day of her life.    This is a true story and should be practically useful to readers who  need it. This woman's stomach had been given too much to do. It  worked hard to do its work well, and had to rob the brain and  nervous system in the effort. This effort brought strain to the  whole brain, which was made evident in the region of the conscience.  It might have come out in some other form. It might have appeared in  irritability. It might even have shown itself in downright ugliness.    Whatever the effects are, whether exaggerated conscience,  exaggerated anxiety, or irritability, the immediate cause of the  trouble in such cases as I refer to is in the fact that the stomach  has been given too much to do.    We give the stomach too much to do if we put a great deal of food  into it when it is tired. We give it too much to do if we put into  it the wrong kind of food. We give it too much to do if we insist  upon working hard ourselves, either with body or brain, directly  after a hearty meal.    No matter how busy we are we can protect our stomachs against each  and all of these three causes of trouble.    If a woman is very tired her stomach must necessarily be very tired  also. If she can remember that at such times even though she may be  very hungry, her body is better nourished if she takes slowly a cup  of hot milk, and waits until she is more rested before taking solid  food, than if she ate a hearty meal. It will save a strain, and  perhaps eventually severe illness.    If it is possible to rest and do absolutely nothing for half an hour  before a meal, and for half an hour after that insures the best work  for our digestion. If one is pretty well, and cannot spare the half  hour, ten or fifteen minutes will do, unless there is a great deal  of fatigue to be conquered.    If it is necessary to work right up to mealtime, let up a little  before stopping. As the time for dinner approaches do not work quite  so hard; the work will not lose; in the end it will gain--and when  you begin work again begin lightly, and get into the thick of it  gradually. That gives your stomach a good chance.    If possible get a long rest before the last meal, and if your day is  very busy, it is better to have the heartiest meal at the end of it,  to take a good rest afterward and then a walk in the fresh air,  which may be long or short, according to what other work you have to  do or according to how tired you are.    I know many women will say: \"But I am tired all the time; if I  waited to rest before I ate, I should starve.\"    The answer to that is \"protect your stomach as well as you can. If  you cannot rest before and after each meal try to arrange some way  by which you can get rid of a little fatigue.\"    If you do this with attention and interest you will find gradually  that you are less tired all the time, and as you keep on steadily  toward the right path, you may be surprised some day to discover  that you are only tired half the time, and perhaps even reach the  place where the tired feeling will be the exception.    It takes a good while to get our misused stomachs into wholesome  ways, but if we are persistent and intelligent we can surely do it,  and the relief to the overstrained stomach--as I have said--means  relief to the whole body.    Resting before and after meals amounts to very little, however, if  we eat food that is not nourishing.    Some people are so far out of the normal way of eating that they  have lost a wholesome sense of what is good for them, and live in a  chronic state of disordered stomach, which means a chronic state of  disordered nerves and disposition. If such persons could for one  minute literally experience the freedom of a woman whose body was  truly and thoroughly nourished, the contrast from the abnormal to  the normal would make them dizzy. If, however, they stayed in the  normal place long enough to get over the dizziness, the freedom of  health would be so great a delight that food that was not nourishing  would be nauseous to them.    Most of us are near enough the normal to know the food that is best  for us, through experience of suffering from food which is not best  for us, as well as through good natural instinct.    If we would learn from the normal working of the involuntary action  of our organs, it might help us greatly toward working more  wholesomely in all our voluntary actions.    If every woman who reads this article would study not to interfere  with the most healthy action of her own stomach, her reward after a  few weeks' persistent care would be not only a greater power for  work, but a greater power for good, healthy, recuperative rest.          CHAPTER XVIII    _About Faces_      WATCH the faces as you walk along the street! If you get the habit  of noticing, your observations will grow keener. It is surprising to  see how seldom we find a really quiet face. I do not mean that there  should be no lines in the face. We are here in this world at school  and we cannot have any real schooling unless we have real  experiences. We cannot have real experiences without suffering, and  suffering which comes from the discipline of life and results in  character leaves lines in our faces. It is the lines made by  unnecessary strain to which I refer.    Strange to say the unquiet faces come mostly from shallow feeling.  Usually the deeper the feeling the less strain there is on the face.  A face may look troubled, it may be full of pain, without a touch of  that strain which comes from shallow worry or excitement.    The strained expression takes character out of the face, it weakens  it, and certainly it detracts greatly from whatever natural beauty  there may have been to begin with. The expression which comes from  pain or any suffering well borne gives character to the face and  adds to its real beauty as well as its strength.    To remove the strained expression we must remove the strain behind;  therefore the hardest work we have to do is below the surface. The  surface work is comparatively easy.    I know a woman whose face is quiet and placid. The lines are really  beautiful, but they are always the same. This woman used to watch  herself in the glass until she had her face as quiet and free from  lines as she could get it--she used even to arrange the corners of  her mouth with her fingers until they had just the right droop.    Then she observed carefully how her face felt with that placid  expression and studied to keep it always with that feeling, until by  and by her features were fixed and now the placid face is always  there, for she has established in her brain an automatic vigilance  over it that will not allow the muscles once to get \"out of  drawing.\"    What kind of an old woman this acquaintance of mine will make I do  not know. I am curious to see her--but now she certainly is a most  remarkable hypocrite. The strain in behind the mask of a face which  she has made for herself must be something frightful. And indeed I  believe it is, for she is ill most of the time--and what could keep  one in nervous illness more entirely than this deep interior strain  which is necessary to such external appearance of placidity.    There comes to my mind at once a very comical illustration of  something quite akin to this although at first thought it seems  almost the reverse. A woman who constantly talked of the  preeminency of mind over matter, and the impossibility of being  moved by external circumstances to any one who believed as she  did--this woman I saw very angry.    She was sitting with her face drawn in a hundred cross lines and all  askew with her anger. She had been spouting and sputtering what she  called her righteous indignation for some minutes, when after a  brief pause and with the angry expression still on her face she  exclaimed: \"Well, I don't care, it's all peace within.\"    I doubt if my masked lady would ever have declared to herself or to  any one else that \"it was all peace within.\" The angry woman  was--without doubt--the deeper hypocrite, but the masked woman had  become rigid in her hypocrisy. I do not know which was the weaker of  the two, probably the one who was deceiving herself.    But to return to those drawn, strained lines we see on the people  about us. They do not come from hard work or deep thought. They come  from unnecessary contractions about the work. If we use our wills  consistently and steadily to drop such contractions, the result is a  more quiet and restful way of living, and so quieter and more  attractive faces.    This unquietness comes especially in the eyes. It is a rare thing to  see a really quiet eye; and very pleasant and beautiful it is when  we do see it. And the more we see and observe "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#18)"],[1,"times.    That these primitive tribes which we find now are not degenerated  specimens of mankind who formerly knew a higher civilization, as it has  occasionally been maintained, has sufficiently been proved by Edwin  Tylor and Lubbock. However, to the arguments already opposed to the  degeneration theory, the following may be added. Save a few tribes  clustering in the less-accessible highlands, the \"savages\" represent a  girdle which encircles the more or less civilized nations, and they  occupy the extremities of our continents, most of which have retained  still, or recently were bearing, an early post-glacial character. Such  are the Eskimos and their congeners in Greenland, Arctic America, and  Northern Siberia; and, in the Southern hemisphere, the Australians, the  Papuas, the Fuegians, and, partly, the Bushmen; while within the  civilized area, like primitive folk are only found in the Himalayas, the  highlands of Australasia, and the plateaus of Brazil. Now it must be  borne in mind that the glacial age did not come to an end at once over  the whole surface of the earth. It still continues in Greenland.  Therefore, at a time when the littoral regions of the Indian Ocean, the  Mediterranean, or the Gulf of Mexico already enjoyed a warmer climate,  and became the seats of higher civilizations, immense territories in  middle Europe, Siberia, and Northern America, as well as in Patagonia,  Southern Africa, and Southern Australasia, remained in early postglacial  conditions which rendered them inaccessible to the civilized nations of  the torrid and sub-torrid zones. They were at that time what the  terrible urmans of North-West Siberia are now, and their population,  inaccessible to and untouched by civilization, retained the characters  of early post-glacial man. Later on, when desiccation rendered these  territories more suitable for agriculture, they were peopled with more  civilized immigrants; and while part of their previous inhabitants were  assimilated by the new settlers, another part migrated further, and  settled where we find them. The territories they inhabit now are still,  or recently were, sub-glacial, as to their physical features; their arts  and implements are those of the neolithic age; and, notwithstanding  their racial differences, and the distances which separate them, their  modes of life and social institutions bear a striking likeness. So we  cannot but consider them as fragments of the early post-glacial  population of the now civilized area.    The first thing which strikes us as soon as we begin studying primitive  folk is the complexity of the organization of marriage relations under  which they are living. With most of them the family, in the sense we  attribute to it, is hardly found in its germs. But they are by no means  loose aggregations of men and women coming in a disorderly manner  together in conformity with their momentary caprices. All of them are  under a certain organization, which has been described by Morgan in its  general aspects as the \"gentile,\" or clan organization.(7)    To tell the matter as briefly as possible, there is little doubt that  mankind has passed at its beginnings through a stage which may be  described as that of \"communal marriage\"; that is, the whole tribe had  husbands and wives in common with but little regard to consanguinity.  But it is also certain that some restrictions to that free intercourse  were imposed at a very early period. Inter-marriage was soon prohibited  between the sons of one mother and her sisters, granddaughters, and  aunts. Later on it was prohibited between the sons and daughters of the  same mother, and further limitations did not fail to follow. The idea of  a gens, or clan, which embodied all presumed descendants from one stock  (or rather all those who gathered in one group) was evolved, and  marriage within the clan was entirely prohibited. It still remained  \"communal,\" but the wife or the husband had to be taken from another  clan. And when a gens became too numerous, and subdivided into several  gentes, each of them was divided into classes (usually four), and  marriage was permitted only between certain well-defined classes. That  is the stage which we find now among the Kamilaroi-speaking Australians.  As to the family, its first germs appeared amidst the clan organization.  A woman who was captured in war from some other clan, and who formerly  would have belonged to the whole gens, could be kept at a later period  by the capturer, under certain obligations towards the tribe. She may be  taken by him to a separate hut, after she had paid a certain tribute to  the clan, and thus constitute within the gens a separate family, the  appearance of which evidently was opening a quite new phase of  civilization.    Now, if we take into consideration that this complicated organization  developed among men who stood at the lowest known degree of development,  and that it maintained itself in societies knowing no kind of authority  besides the authority of public opinion, we at once see how deeply  inrooted social instincts must have been in human nature, even at its  lowest stages. A savage who is capable of living under such an  organization, and of freely submitting to rules which continually clash  with his personal desires, certainly is not a beast devoid of ethical  principles and knowing no rein to its passions. But the fact becomes  still more striking if we consider the immense antiquity of the clan  organization. It is now known that the primitive Semites, the Greeks of  Homer, the prehistoric Romans, the Germans of Tacitus, the early Celts  and the early Slavonians, all have had their own period of clan  organization, closely analogous to that of the Australians, the Red  Indians, the Eskimos, and other inhabitants of the \"savage girdle.\"(9)  So we must admit that either the evolution of marriage laws went on on  the same lines among all human races, or the rudiments of the clan rules  were developed among some common ancestors of the Semites, the Aryans,  the Polynesians, etc., before their differentiation into separate races  took place, and that these rules were maintained, until now, among races  long ago separated from the common stock. Both alternatives imply,  however, an equally striking tenacity of the institution--such a  tenacity that no assaults of the individual could break it down through  the scores of thousands of years that it was in existence. The very  persistence of the clan organization shows how utterly false it is to  represent primitive mankind as a disorderly agglomeration of  individuals, who only obey their individual passions, and take advantage  of their personal force and cunningness against all other  representatives of the species. Unbridled individualism is a modern  growth, but it is not characteristic of primitive mankind.(10)    Going now over to the existing savages, we may begin with the Bushmen,  who stand at a very low level of development--so low indeed that they  have no dwellings and sleep in holes dug in the soil, occasionally  protected by some screens. It is known that when Europeans settled in  their territory and destroyed deer, the Bushmen began stealing the  settlers' cattle, whereupon a war of extermination, too horrible to be  related here, was waged against them. Five hundred Bushmen were  slaughtered in 1774, three thousand in 1808 and 1809 by the Farmers'  Alliance, and so on. They were poisoned like rats, killed by hunters  lying in ambush before the carcass of some animal, killed wherever met  with.(11) So that our knowledge of the Bushmen, being chiefly borrowed  from those same people who exterminated them, is necessarily limited.  But still we know that when the Europeans came, the Bushmen lived in  small tribes (or clans), sometimes federated together; that they used to  hunt in common, and divided the spoil without quarrelling; that they  never abandoned their wounded, and displayed strong affection to their  comrades. Lichtenstein has a most touching story about a Bushman, nearly  drowned in a river, who was rescued by his companions. They took off  their furs to cover him, and shivered themselves; they dried him, rubbed  him before the fire, and smeared his body with warm grease till they  brought him back to life. And when the Bushmen found, in Johan van der  Walt, a man who treated them well, they expressed their thankfulness by  a most touching attachment to that man.(12) Burchell and Moffat both  represent them as goodhearted, disinterested, true to their promises,  and grateful,(13) all qualities which could develop only by being  practised within the tribe. As to their love to children, it is  sufficient to say that when a European wished to secure a Bushman woman  as a slave, he stole her child: the mother was sure to come into slavery  to share the fate of her child.(14)    The same social manners characterize the Hottentots, who are but a  little more developed than the Bushmen. Lubbock describes them as \"the  filthiest animals,\" and filthy they really are. A fur suspended to the  neck and worn till it falls to pieces is all their dress; their huts are  a few sticks assembled together and covered with mats, with no kind of  furniture within. And though they kept oxen and sheep, and seem to have  known the use of iron before they made acquaintance with the Europeans,  they still occupy one of the lowest degrees of the human scale. And yet  those who knew them highly praised their sociability and readiness to  aid each other. If anything is given to a Hottentot, he at once divides  it among all present--a habit which, as is known, so much struck Darwin  among the Fuegians. He cannot eat alone, and, however hungry, he calls  those who pass by to share his food. And when Kolben expressed his  astonishment thereat, he received the answer. \"That is Hottentot  manner.\" But this is not Hottentot manner only: it is an all but"]]]
