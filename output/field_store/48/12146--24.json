Johnny being a past-master in his trade, stood on the platform in the  upper air, guiding the saw along the marked lines; and as he instructed  us all in the fine art of pit-sawing, Dan decided that the building of a  house, under some circumstances, could be an education in itself.    \"Thought she might manage to learn a thing or two out of it,\" he said.  \"The building of it is right enough. It all depends what she uses it for  when Johnny's done with it.\"    As the pliant saw coaxed beams, and slabs, and flooring boards out of  the forest trees I grew to like beginning at the beginning of  things, and realised there was an underlying truth in Dan's whimsical  reiteration, that \"the missus was in luck when she struck this place\";  for beams and slabs and flooring boards wrested from Nature amid  merrymaking and philosophical discourses are not as other beams and  slabs and flooring boards. They are old friends and fellow-adventurers,  with many a good tale to tell, recalling comical situations in their  reminiscences with a vividness that baffles description.    Perhaps those who live in homes with the beginning of things left behind  in forests they have never seen, may think chattering planks a poor  compensation for unpapered, rough-boarded walls and unglazed window  frames. Let them try it before they judge; remembering always, that  before a house can be built of old friends and memories the friends must  be made and the memories lived through.    But other things beside the sawing of timber were in progress, Things  were also \"humming\" in the dog world. A sturdy fox-terrier, Brown by  name, had been given by a passing traveller to the Maluka, given  almost of necessity for Brown--as is the way with fox-terriers at  times--quietly changed masters, and lying down at the Maluka's feet, had  refused to leave him. The station dogs resented his presence there, and  persecuted him as an interloper; and being a peace-loving dog, Brown  bore it patiently for two days, hoping, no doubt, the persecution would  wear itself out. On the third day, however, he quietly changed his  tactics--for sometimes the only road to peace is through fighting--and,  accepting their challenge, took on the station dogs one by one in single  combat.    Only a full-sized particularly sturdy-looking fox-terrier against expert  cattle dogs; and yet no dog could stand against him. One by one he  closed with them, and one by one they went before him; and at the end of  a week he was \"cock of the walk,\" and lay down to enjoy his well-earned  peace. His death-stroke was a flashing lunge, from a grip of a foreleg  to a sharp, grinding grip of the enemy's tongue. How he managed it was  a puzzle, but sooner or later he got his grip in, to let go at the  piercing yell of defeat that invariably followed. But Brown was a  gentleman, not a bully, and after each fight buried the hatchet,  appearing to shake hands with his late adversary. No doubt if he had had  a tail he would have wagged it, but Brown had been born with a large,  perfectly round, black spot, at the root of his tail, and his then  owner, having an eye for the picturesque, had removed his white tail  entirely, even to its last joint, to allow of no break in the spot; and  when the spirit moved Brown to wag a tail, a violent stirring of hairs  in the centre of this spot betrayed his desire to the world. It goes  without saying that Brown did not fight the canine women-folk; for, as  some one has said, man is the only animal that strikes his women-folk.    Most of the battles were fought in the station thoroughfare, all of them  taking on the form of a general melee. As soon as Brown closed with an  enemy, the rest of the dogs each sought an especial adversary, hoping to  wipe out some past defeat; while the pups, having no past to wipe  out, diverted themselves by skirmishing about on the outskirts of  the scrimmage, nipping joyously at any hind quarters that came handy,  bumping into other groups of pups, thoroughly enjoying life, and  accumulating material for future fights among themselves.    Altogether we had a lively week. To interfere in the fights only  prolonged them; and, to add to the general hubbub, the servant question  had opened up again. Jimmy's Nellie, who had been simmering for some  time, suddenly rebelled, and refused to consider herself among the  rejected.    We said there was no vacancy on the staff for her, and she immediately  set herself to create one, by pounding and punching at the staff in  private. Finding this of no avail, she threatened to \"sing\" Maudie dead,  also in private, unless she resigned. Maudie proving unexpectedly tough  and defiant, Nellie gave up all hope of creating a vacancy, and changing  front, adopted a stone-walling policy. Every morning, quietly and  doggedly, she put herself on the staff, and every morning was as quietly  and doggedly dismissed from office.    Doggedness being an unusual trait in a black fellow, the homestead  became interested. \"Never say die, little 'un,\" the Maluka laughed each  morning; but Dan was inclined to bet on Nellie.    \"She's got nothing else to do, and can concentrate all her thoughts on  it,\" he said, \"and besides, it means more for her.\"    It meant a good deal to me, too, for I particularly objected to Jimmy's  Nellie partly because she was an inveterate smoker and a profuse spitter  upon floors; partly because--well to be quite honest--because a good  application of carbolic soap would have done no harm; and partly because  she appeared to have a passion for exceedingly scanty garments,  her favourite costume being a skirt made from the upper half of a  fifty-pound calico flour bag. Her blouses had, apparently, been all  mislaid. Nellie, unconscious of my real objections, daily and doggedly  put herself on the staff, and was daily and doggedly dismissed. But  as she generally managed to do the very thing that most needed doing,  before I could find her to dismiss, Dan was offering ten to one on  Nellie by Easter time.    \"Another moon'll see her on the staff,\" he prophesied, as we prepared to  go out-bush for Easter.    The Easter moon had come in dry and cool, and at its full the Wet  lifted, as our traveller had foretold. Only a bushman's personal  observation, remember, this lifting of the Wet with the full of the  Easter moon, not a scientific statement; but by an insight peculiarly  their own, bushmen come at more facts than most men.    Sam did his best with Bunday, serving hot rolls with mysterious markings  on them for breakfast, and by midday he had the homestead to himself,  the Maluka and I being camped at Bitter Springs and every one else being  elsewhere. Our business was yard-inspection, with Goggle-Eye as general  factotum. We, of course, had ridden out, but Goggle-Eye had preferred  to walk. \"Me all day knock up longa horse,\" he explained striding  comfortably along beside us.    Several exciting hours were spent with boxes of wax matches, burning the  rank grass back from the yard at the springs (at Goggle-Eye's suggestion  the missus had been pressed into the service); and then we rode through  the rank grass along the river, scattering matches as we went like  sparks from an engine. As soon as the rank grass seeds it must be burnt  off, before the soil loses its moisture, to ensure a second shorter  spring, and everywhere we went now clouds of dense smoke rose behind us.    That walk about with the Maluka and \"Gadgerrie\" lived like a red-letter  day in old Goggle-Eye's memory; for did he not himself strike a dozen  full boxes of matches?    Dan was away beyond the northern boundary, going through the cattle,  judging the probable duration of \"outside waters\" for that year, burning  off too as he rode. The Quiet Stockman was away beyond the southern  boundary, rounding up wanderers and stragglers among the horses, and the  station was face to face with the year's work, making preparations  for the year's mustering and branding--for with the lifting of the Wet  everything in the Never-Never begins to move.    \"After the Wet\" rivers go down, the north-west monsoon giving place  to the south-east Trades; bogs dry up everywhere, opening all  roads; travellers pass through the stations from all points of the  compass--cattle buyers, drovers, station-owners, telegraph people--all  bent on business, and all glad to get moving after the long compulsory  inaction of the Wet; and lastly that great yearly cumbrous event takes  place: the starting of the \"waggons,\" with their year's stores for  Inside.    The first batch of travellers had little news for us. They had heard  that the teams were loading up, and couldn't say for certain, and,  finding them unsatisfactory, we looked forward to the coming of the  \"Fizzer,\" our mailman, who was almost due.    Eight mails a year was our allowance, with an extra one now and then  through the courtesy of travellers. Eight mails a year against eight  hundred for the townsfolk. Was it any wonder that we all found we had  business at the homestead when the Fizzer was due there?    When he came this trip he was, as usual, brimming over with news:  personal items, public gossip, and the news that the horse teams had got  most of their loading on, and that the Macs were getting their bullocks  under way. Two horse waggons and a dray for far \"inside,\" and three  bullock waggons for the nearer distances, comprised the \"waggons\" that  year. The teamsters were Englishmen; but the bullock-punchers were three  \"Macs\"--an Irishman, a Highlander, and the Sanguine Scot.    Six waggons, and about six months' hard travelling, in and out, to  provide a year's stores for three cattle stations and two telegraph  stations. It is not surprising that the freight per ton was what it  was--twenty-two pounds per ton for the Elsey, and upwards of forty  pounds for \"insid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#18)"],[1,"attempts, therefore, at a science of any human things, at a science  of history, a science of folk-lore, a science of sociology, are by  their nature not merely hopeless, but crazy. You can no more be certain  in economic history that a man's desire for money was merely a desire  for money than you can be certain in hagiology that a saint's desire  for God was merely a desire for God. And this kind of vagueness in the  primary phenomena of the study is an absolutely final blow to anything  in the nature of a science. Men can construct a science with very few  instruments, or with very plain instruments; but no one on earth could  construct a science with unreliable instruments.  A man might work out  the whole of mathematics with a handful of pebbles, but not with a  handful of clay which was always falling apart into new fragments, and  falling together into new combinations. A man might measure heaven and  earth with a reed, but not with a growing reed.    As one of the enormous follies of folk-lore, let us take the case of  the transmigration of stories, and the alleged unity of their source.  Story after story the scientific mythologists have cut out of its place  in history, and pinned side by side with similar stories in their  museum of fables.  The process is industrious, it is fascinating, and  the whole of it rests on one of the plainest fallacies in the world.  That a story has been told all over the place at some time or other,  not only does not prove that it never really happened; it does not even  faintly indicate or make slightly more probable that it never happened.  That a large number of fishermen have falsely asserted that they have  caught a pike two feet long, does not in the least affect the question  of whether any one ever really did so.  That numberless journalists  announce a Franco-German war merely for money is no evidence one way or  the other upon the dark question of whether such a war ever occurred.  Doubtless in a few hundred years the innumerable Franco-German wars  that did not happen will have cleared the scientific mind of any belief  in the legendary war of '70 which did. But that will be because if  folk-lore students remain at all, their nature will be unchanged; and  their services to folk-lore will be still as they are at present,  greater than they know. For in truth these men do something far more  godlike than studying legends; they create them.    There are two kinds of stories which the scientists say cannot be true,  because everybody tells them.  The first class consists of the stories  which are told everywhere, because they are somewhat odd or clever;  there is nothing in the world to prevent their having happened to  somebody as an adventure any more than there is anything to prevent  their having occurred, as they certainly did occur, to somebody as an  idea. But they are not likely to have happened to many people. The  second class of their \"myths\" consist of the stories that are told  everywhere for the simple reason that they happen everywhere. Of the  first class, for instance, we might take such an example as the story  of William Tell, now generally ranked among legends upon the sole  ground that it is found in the tales of other peoples. Now, it is  obvious that this was told everywhere because whether true or  fictitious it is what is called \"a good story;\" it is odd, exciting,  and it has a climax.  But to suggest that some such eccentric incident  can never have happened in the whole history of archery, or that it did  not happen to any particular person of whom it is told, is stark  impudence.  The idea of shooting at a mark attached to some valuable or  beloved person is an idea doubtless that might easily have occurred to  any inventive poet. But it is also an idea that might easily occur to  any boastful archer. It might be one of the fantastic caprices of some  story-teller. It might equally well be one of the fantastic caprices of  some tyrant. It might occur first in real life and afterwards occur in  legends. Or it might just as well occur first in legends and afterwards  occur in real life.  If no apple has ever been shot off a boy's head  from the beginning of the world, it may be done tomorrow morning, and  by somebody who has never heard of William Tell.    This type of tale, indeed, may be pretty fairly paralleled with the  ordinary anecdote terminating in a repartee or an Irish bull. Such a  retort as the famous \"je ne vois pas la necessite\" we have all seen  attributed to Talleyrand, to Voltaire, to Henri Quatre, to an anonymous  judge, and so on.  But this variety does not in any way make it more  likely that the thing was never said at all. It is highly likely that  it was really said by somebody unknown. It is highly likely that it was  really said by Talleyrand. In any case, it is not any more difficult to  believe that the mot might have occurred to a man in conversation than  to a man writing memoirs. It might have occurred to any of the men I  have mentioned. But there is this point of distinction about it, that  it is not likely to have occurred to all of them.  And this is where  the first class of so-called myth differs from the second to which I  have previously referred.  For there is a second class of incident  found to be common to the stories of five or six heroes, say to Sigurd,  to Hercules, to Rustem, to the Cid, and so on. And the peculiarity of  this myth is that not only is it highly reasonable to imagine that it  really happened to one hero, but it is highly reasonable to imagine  that it really happened to all of them. Such a story, for instance, is  that of a great man having his strength swayed or thwarted by the  mysterious weakness of a woman. The anecdotal story, the story of  William Tell, is as I have said, popular, because it is peculiar.  But  this kind of story, the story of Samson and Delilah of Arthur and  Guinevere, is obviously popular because it is not peculiar.  It is  popular as good, quiet fiction is popular, because it tells the truth  about people. If the ruin of Samson by a woman, and the ruin of  Hercules by a woman, have a common legendary origin, it is gratifying  to know that we can also explain, as a fable, the ruin of Nelson by a  woman and the ruin of Parnell by a woman.  And, indeed, I have no doubt  whatever that, some centuries hence, the students of folk-lore will  refuse altogether to believe that Elizabeth Barrett eloped with Robert  Browning, and will prove their point up to the hilt by the  unquestionable fact that the whole fiction of the period was full of  such elopements from end to end.    Possibly the most pathetic of all the delusions of the modern students  of primitive belief is the notion they have about the thing they call  anthropomorphism.  They believe that primitive men attributed phenomena  to a god in human form in order to explain them, because his mind in  its sullen limitation could not reach any further than his own clownish  existence.  The thunder was called the voice of a man, the lightning  the eyes of a man, because by this explanation they were made more  reasonable and comfortable. The final cure for all this kind of  philosophy is to walk down a lane at night.  Any one who does so will  discover very quickly that men pictured something semi-human at the  back of all things, not because such a thought was natural, but because  it was supernatural; not because it made things more comprehensible,  but because it made them a hundred times more incomprehensible and  mysterious. For a man walking down a lane at night can see the  conspicuous fact that as long as nature keeps to her own course, she  has no power with us at all.  As long as a tree is a tree, it is a  top-heavy monster with a hundred arms, a thousand tongues, and only one  leg. But so long as a tree is a tree, it does not frighten us at all.  It begins to be something alien, to be something strange, only when it  looks like ourselves.  When a tree really looks like a man our knees  knock under us.  And when the whole universe looks like a man we fall  on our faces.        XII Paganism and Mr. Lowes Dickinson    Of the New Paganism (or neo-Paganism), as it was preached flamboyantly  by Mr. Swinburne or delicately by Walter Pater, there is no necessity  to take any very grave account, except as a thing which left behind it  incomparable exercises in the English language.  The New Paganism is no  longer new, and it never at any time bore the smallest resemblance to  Paganism. The ideas about the ancient civilization which it has left  loose in the public mind are certainly extraordinary enough. The term  \"pagan\" is continually used in fiction and light literature as meaning  a man without any religion, whereas a pagan was generally a man with  about half a dozen.  The pagans, according to this notion, were  continually crowning themselves with flowers and dancing about in an  irresponsible state, whereas, if there were two things that the best  pagan civilization did honestly believe in, they were a rather too  rigid dignity and a much too rigid responsibility. Pagans are depicted  as above all things inebriate and lawless, whereas they were above all  things reasonable and respectable. They are praised as disobedient when  they had only one great virtue--civic obedience.  They are envied and  admired as shamelessly happy when they had only one great sin--despair.    Mr. Lowes Dickinson, the most pregnant and provocative of recent  writers on this and similar subjects, is far too solid a man to have  fallen into this old error of the mere anarchy of Paganism. In order to  make hay of that Hellenic enthusiasm which has as its ideal mere  appetite and egotism, it is not necessary to know much philosophy, but  merely to know a little Greek. Mr. Lowes Dickinson knows a great deal  of philosophy, and also a great deal of Greek, and his error, if error  he has, is not that of the crude"]]]
